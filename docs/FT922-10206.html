			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Germany leads push against recognition GERMANY last night led a strong push inside the European Community to withhold recognition of the new joint Serb-Montenegrin state as the successor to the old Yugoslavia, in an attempt to get the Serb army out of Bosnia. EC foreign ministers are to devote most of their meeting here today to Yugoslavia. But even at the outset of yesterday's discussions, a German spokesman said Bonn would also be seeking United Nations action on trade and oil sanctions against Serbia. Britain echoed the general sentiment that, by declaring a new state, President Slobadan Milosevic of Serbia has given the Community a certain diplomatic leverage over him. 'It would seem that Mr Milosevic is more concerned about recognition and status than he is about his economy'. Greece's prime minister, Mr Constantine Mitzotakis came in for criticism for arriving at this weekend's meeting via Belgrade where he appeared to confer de facto recognition on the new Yugoslav state. On Macedonia, the EC ministers seemed agreed to respect, Greece's strong views.</p>

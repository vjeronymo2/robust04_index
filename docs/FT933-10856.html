			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Blow for Lloyd's as finance chief quits LLOYD'S OF LONDON, the troubled insurance market, has suffered a fresh blow with the surprise resignation of Mr David Bruce, its finance director, after only four months. News of his departure after only four months in the job emerged yesterday. Last night Lloyd's offered no explanation but said that Mr Stephen Hall, a former partner with Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, had been appointed to the vacancy. Mr Bruce, who is in his mid-40s, was formerly group finance director at Guinness Mahon, the merchant bank. Before that he was director of finance and administration at the Stock Exchange. He was appointed to the post at Lloyd's in March in succession to Mr John Gaynor. He is one of a new breed of more commercially minded executives introduced to the Corporation of Lloyd's, which administers and regulates the Lloyd's market, by Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive, and Mr David Rowland, the chairman. Mr Bruce's initial reponsibilities included supervising the attraction of corporate investors to the market, although within the past six weeks Lloyd's has appointed another outsider, Mr Ewen Gilmour, to manage this process under Mr Bruce. Mr Hall, 60, retired early from Ernst &amp; Young, where he took a close interest in eastern European privatisations.</p>

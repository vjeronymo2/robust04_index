			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> FREED CASOLO HITS LECTURE TRAIL  </P> <P> Jennifer Casolo wants to make the most of her imprisonment in a Salvadoran jail  by going on the lecture circuit. Casolo, 28, speaking Tuesday night at a church  service in her hometown of Thomaston, Conn., says she plans to hit 10 to 12  cities after the holidays to talk about the plight of the Salvadoran people.  </P> <P> Casolo, who was freed after being imprisoned 17 days on charges of abetting  communist rebels, said she hopes her time in the limelight will end so that she  can go about her work and carry her message to the people. "I don't want to be  Jennifer Casolo," she said. "I want to be someone who witnessed the pain and  suffering in El Salvador. I don't want to be special." One person she plans to  speak to is Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.), who was instrumental in  securing her release. She wants him to reverse his position and call for an end  to U.S. military aid to El Salvador.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pakistan has decided to close down its Consulate  General in Bombay with immediate effect.    The Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad was called to the  Foreign Office today and informed of Pakistan's decision. A  spokesman of the Foreign Office said that this decision was  taken because the Consulate General found it impossible to  function effectively due to noncooperative and negative attitude  of Indian authorities. The spokesman recalled that Indian  Government had gone back on its commitment to leave the Jinnah  House for use of the Consulate General in Bombay. The Indian  authorities had even refused to (?permit) the acquisition of the  principal premises for the Consulate General. The Maharashtra  Government had in fact acted in a manner that made it extremely  difficult for the Consulate General to carry out its assigned  functions.</p>

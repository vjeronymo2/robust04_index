			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Heseltine raps engineers and CBI over 'turf battles' Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, has stepped up his campaign for more effective industrial and trade associations by criticising the Engineering Employers' Federation and the Confederation of British Industry for failing to merge their central functions. Mr Heseltine, in a speech at the federation's biennial dinner in London last night, said 'turf battles and power struggles' had overwhelmed the two organisations. The federation said earlier this year that plans for a merger of the two organisations' central functions had been abandoned. But it is now discussing a more limited arrangement that could produce an alliance with the CBI's National Manufacturing Council in areas where they overlap. Last year Mr Heseltine said his department wanted to talk to a limited number of 'lead' associations that would represent wide areas of industry. Last night he said he had been impressed by the number of trade associations that had come forward to help address the key issues of Britain's competitiveness. The DTI had to select the associations that could deliver the ability to gauge competitiveness. 'We will not talk to those that can't,' he said. Referring to similar attempts to forge unity in the engineering professions, Mr Heseltine said Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the Engineering Council, had 'spent an age' in an as yet unsuccessful quest to create unity from 45 institutions in an initiative to give the professions some clout.</p>

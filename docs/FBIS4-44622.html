			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Peng Jiangde [1756 3068 1779], Li Jinghui [2621 </F> 0079 6540] et al. of the Dept. of Electronic Engineering,  Qinghua Univ., Beijing 100084: ``980-nm LD-Pumped  Er[.sup]3+[/]-Doped Fiber Optical Amplifier Module with  Bandwidth |g 40 nm,'' supported by grant from 863 Program; MS  received 18 Nov 93. Cf. early brief report in JPRS-CST-94-001,  24 Jan 94 p 31]    [Abstract] The first domestic development of a utilitarian  Er-doped fiber optical amplifier (EDFA) module prototype using a  40-mW, 980-nm-wavelength laser diode (LD) as the pump source and  a parametrically optimized Er[.sup]3+[/]/Al[.sup]3+[/]  co-doped optical fiber is reported. Module net gain at 1550 nm  is 25 dB, saturated output power is 0 dBm, maximum output power  is 8 dBm, noise figure is less than 5 dB, and optical bandwidth  is greater than 40 nm--values comparable to early-90s  international standards as reported in references 3-5. These  modules were jointly developed by Qinghua University, the CAS  Institute of Semiconductors, the 863 Optoelectronics Fabrication  Center, and MEI's Institute 46, and are designed for  wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) fiber optic transmission  systems and optical soliton transmission systems.    Figures 1-4, not reproduced, show the following: a schematic  of the EDFA module, consisting of a fiber coupler, an isolator,  the LD, a WDM coupler, a control unit, a power supply, a fiber  splice, the Er-doped fiber, and another fiber coupler; a graph  of EDFA module gain vs signal output power; a graph of EDFA  module output power vs input power; and a graph of EDFA module  bandwidth (net gain vs signal wavelength), respectively. There  are no tables.  <H5>  References: </H5>   1. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN [HIGH TECHNOLOGY  LETTERS], 1991,(10):1.    2. Peng Jiangde et al., GAO JISHU TONGXUN, 1992, 2(12):l0.    3.

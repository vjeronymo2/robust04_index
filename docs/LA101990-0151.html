			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRVINE PC FIRM READY TO TAKE ON NEC IN JAPAN;  </P> <P> COMPUTERS: WITH THREE JAPANESE DISTRIBUTORS, AST RESEARCH WILL BEGIN ITS SALES  EFFORT NEXT MONTH.  </P> <P> AST Research Inc., an Irvine-based personal computer maker, has signed up three  distributors for its new made-for-Japan computer, overcoming the final obstacle  to beginning sales next month of the hybrid machine.  </P> <P> The machine drew strong interest when it was first announced in July because it  was the first time an outside company had challenged NEC Corp.'s dominance of  the Japanese personal computer market with a compatible machine.  </P> <P> AST's DualStation 386SX (previously named the Dual SX/16) is compatible with  both the NEC 9801 computer, which has become the standard in Japan, as well as  with the International Business Machines AT.  </P> <P> "We are committing significant resources to the development and promotion of  the DualStation," said Safi Qureshey, AST co-chairman and chief executive.  </P> <P> Japanese observers who attended Thursday's conference, however, were skeptical  of how effective a challenge to NEC the DualStation could mount.  </P> <P> "In Japan there isn't much demand for IBM ATs," said Seiji Matsufuji, a  reporter for Nikkei Personal Computer, a trade publication. While AST was smart  in making the computer NEC-compatible, Matsufuji said, it needs to make it  cheaper to compete.  </P> <P> AST said it would sell its cheapest model for $2,920, about the price of an  equivalent NEC model without the AT option.  </P> <P> Unless customers have set their heart on using IBM-compatible software,  Japanese customers will choose manufacturers such as NEC with a strong  reputation for quality, observers say. AST's choice of distributors also belies  its intent to grab a 3% to 5% share of the Japanese market. One distributor,  Okura &amp; Co., is a trading company with most of its sales in machinery and  metals. Its distribution channels are primarily through dealers. Another,  Proside Corp., is a relatively small entrepreneurial dealer.  </P> <P> AST's third distributor, Swire Trastech, deals primarily with foreign companies  in Japan and research institutes. None of the distributors have strong channels  among retail stores.  </P> <P> It is also far from clear whether AST's new distributors can bring the  marketing muscle to compete with such powerhouses as NEC and Epson without a  price advantage. Epson is the largest Japanese maker to sell a NEC-compatible  machine.  </P> <P> Skeptics here said the new computer would sell primarily to the small number of  users who absolutely must deal with both Japanese and English word processing.  </P> <P> The company recognizes these weaknesses and plans to gradually build up its  name and presence in the Japanese market over several years, a spokeswoman for  AST Japan said. As AST's sales expand, she said, the distributors will also  develop new retail channels.  </P> <P> AST also announced Thursday that it sold more than 70 high-performance  computers to the Tokyo Grain Exchange for about $1 million. The workstations  will be used by traders on the commodity exchange.  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer Dean Takahashi in Orange County contributed to this report.  </P></p>

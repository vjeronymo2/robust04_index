			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe rethinks bono trade THE London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange (Liffe) may relaunch its unsuccessful Spanish government bond (bonos) contract this autumn, with a designated market-maker system to boost liquidity, according to traders. Such a system obliges firms to keep a presence in the pit. Three weeks ago, Liffe suspended the December contract due to lack of volume, and began reviewing the contract. The September contract, which was not suspended, traded 17 contracts last month, while a rival contract on Meff, the Spanish futures exchange, trades more than 10,000 daily. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), which in June became the first Spanish bank to obtain a seat on Liffe, may become one of a small group of market-makers in the contract.</p>

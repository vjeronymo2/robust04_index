			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem by </F> reporter Manuel de la Rosa and Caracol News Director Dario  Arizmendi at the Cartagena de Indias Convention Center -- live]    [Excerpt] [De La Rosa] Good morning. We are here with  Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, who is playing a tennis  match teamed up with Dr. Miguel Silva against Ambassador Alberto  Casas and Counselor Ricardo Avila. Are you winning, Mr.  President?    [Menem] We were at deuce, so we will have to continue to  play.    [De La Rosa] Mr. President, regarding the surprise speech by  Cuban President Fidel Castro at the convention center yesterday  afternoon, as well as the subsequent remark he made as he was  riding in a car -- something to the effect of: We are divided --  what is your opinion on this?    [Menem] I would say there are different concepts of  democracy. One is the one understood by free countries in which  the people elect their representatives. There are no barriers,  no penalties, and no prohibitions on leaving one's territory or  on stating one's opinion -- places in which there are no  political prisons, persecution, or torture.    The other form of democracy is that which Commander Fidel  Castro understands. He gets angry, speaks out melodramatically  regarding the situation in Cuba, and I say this with all respect  due to the commander. Only one thing is to blame for the crisis  Cuba is facing, and it is this: As long as Cuba does not live  in democracy, and as long as it does not return to a way of life  common to other countries in America and in the world, it will  be very difficult for our positions to agree.    I have been a victim of the tyranny of a dictatorship. I was  virtually an outlaw in my own country for 25 years. I spent  five years in prison. I know what it is like to be tortured,  what the punishment cells entail. I know that my companions  suffered greatly during the years when the killings occurred.  Nobody can tell me or teach me anything about that, not even  the commander, who was never in prison.    Moreover, there is no indication that the situation in Cuba  will change. This is something that is entirely up to him.  This is why I do not see any sense in the melodrama he is  making of the Cuban situation, blaming it on the U.S. blockade  imposed solely, I would say, by the United States. Other  countries are trading and, in fact, bringing capital into Cuba.  The measures and controls are so strict, however, that they  discourage any type of investment. This is the truth.    [De La Rosa] President Menem, this melodrama that you speak  of by Fidel Castro, couldn't it complicate things for Latin  American integration?    [Menem] No, no, no. I am familiar with integration processes  in other parts of the world in which countries that disagree  with circumstances that prevail in a region or on a continent  cannot integrate with the other nations of the region. They do  not enter into the free zone until their plans and proposals  change. If we live in a democracy, one has to follow the steps  of the majority -- not only the majority at the state level, but  also the majority at the level of the people.    [De La Rosa] Commander Castro noted that he was hurt  yesterday afternoon by a lack of solidarity from the Latin  American countries against the U.S.-imposed blockade against the  island.    [Menem] I do not believe it is a lack of solidarity. I  reiterate that many countries of the world are commercializing  and taking their production to Cuba, as well as working with  Cuba over these past few years. For instance, in 1974 the  Argentine Republic under the presidency of General Peron broke  the U.S. blockade and assisted Cuba with resources, products,  and foodstuffs to the point that ever since then, and subsequent  to the many contributions that were made, Cuba owes Argentina  more than $1 billion. The commander, should then speak of this  reality, which we Argentines know of very well.    [De La Rosa] Are the Ibero-American countries divided then,  as the Cuban president stated informally?    [Menem] I do not think they are divided, just the opposite.  We are all asking Commander Castro to give respite to the Cuban  people -- to leave them in a position to exercise their rights.  We are speaking of the defense of human rights. We are  speaking of life. We are speaking of liberty. Obviously these  things are nonexistent in Cuba.    [De La Rosa] President Menem, thank you for suspending your  tennis match to give an interview to Caracol Network. Dario, do  you have any questions?    [Arizmendi] Yes, of course. We are pleased to greet  President Carlos Saul Menem again, after interviewing him  exactly one year ago for Colombian television. Mr. President,  if the Cuban president does not change his position regarding  the concept of democracy, as it is understood in Western terms,  is there a possibility that he will not be invited to future  summits?    [Menem] No, no. The commander is always going to be invited.  Now, Dario, I do not understand the distinction that you just  made -- Western style democracy. I believe there is only one  democracy. Everyone participates in that democracy. Democracy  is created when people elect their representatives and when the  representatives govern for the people. There is only one kind  of democracy, and not the kind maintained by Fidel Castro. It  so happens that not too many years ago Chilean President  Pinochet said his dictatorship was a democratic one. In other  words, there are different concepts of democracy, but there is  only one kind of democracy.    [Arizmendi] President Menem, you have been, perhaps, one of  the most principled presidents, and your attitude regarding all  types of dictatorship has been well-known to the public for some  time. When you meet Cuban President Fidel Castro, how do you  greet one another? Is there any kind of warmth or cordiality, or  is there distance between you?    [Menem] No, there is cordiality, and there is fluid  dialogue,  but we do not speak of politics or anything related. We were  talking yesterday about the place where I was born, what we do  there, what my family's activities are, whether my family has  vineyards, and if my family makes wine. I explained several  things to him regarding my hometown in a province in the  northwestern region of the Argentine Republic. We did not  broach politics at all. Those things have to be discussed  publicly. They have to be treated as we have been treating them  since the Guadalajara summit. The commander also, publicly, has  referred to his form and style of government, and his references  are common to those of any dictatorship, or at least any kind of  government outside democracy.

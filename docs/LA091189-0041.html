			<p><P> September 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET CATHOLIC AND JEW SHARE WHERE WE HURT AND WHY  </P> <P> Some Jewish organizations, anguished over the failure of Polish Catholic  officials to honor their agreement to remove a Carmelite convent from the  grounds of Auschwitz, have issued an emotional appeal for the severing of  relations between Jewish groups and the Vatican. I opposed such a policy when  it was first proposed last spring and am even more critical of it today.  </P> <P> The practical effect of breaking off relations is to discontinue dialogue. Yet  dialogue and discussion between Catholics and Jews are precisely what is needed  today, not alienation and antagonism.  </P> <P> Three issues threaten to damage the progress in Catholic-Jewish relations that  has been painstakingly made since the Second Vatican Council more than 20 years  ago:  </P> <P>  -- Recent statements by Pope John Paul II that appeared to denigrate the  validity of God's covenant with the Jewish people.  </P> <P>  -- The Vatican's persistent refusal to enter into diplomatic relations with  Israel, while granting a Papal audience to PLO terrorist chief Yasser Arafat.  </P> <P>  -- The dispute over the Carmelite convent in Auschwitz, which to Jews is  symbolic of the most painful martyrdom in Jewish history. Two years ago the  leading church authorities in Poland, Belgium and France -- including Cardinal  Franciszek Macharski of Krakow -- agreed to relocate the convent by February of  this year.  </P> <P> I believe that such issues can be resolved, but only by discussion and  persuasion, not by threats and intimidation.  </P> <P> We have already had a glimpse of the forces of unreason and irresponsibility  coming to the fore. The actions of a small group of militant Jewish  demonstrators who scaled a wall and entered the Auschwitz convent's yard, their  brutal beating by Polish construction workers and the intemperate, blundering  response by the highest church official in Poland are a forerunner of the  consequences of formally breaking off communication and dialogue.  </P> <P> There is every reason to believe that responsible forces within the Catholic  Church will see to it that the agreement to remove the convent is honored. The  other issues are also susceptible of resolution -- but only if we talk,  patiently and calmly, each explaining to the other where we hurt and why.  </P> <P> The Catholic Church has acknowledged a need to reaffirm its fundamental kinship  with Judaism. Jewish communities throughout the world need the Catholic Church  as an ally against extremists of the left and right. This is particularly true  of small Jewish communities like those in Latin America, where political  instability is rampant.  </P> <P> Consider the experience of Brazil, where I have lived and worked since 1970.  Brazil has more Catholics -- 140 million -- than any other country in the  world. Its Jewish population is 150,000. Despite this ratio of nearly 1,000 to  1, relations between Catholics and Jews in Brazil are a model of mutual  recognition and respect.  </P> <P> This acceptance of religious differences in Brazil follows generations of  mutual misunderstanding and distrust. The turning point came in 1975, when the  prison torture and murder of Vladimir Herzog, a young Jewish journalist and  university professor, aroused many segments of the Brazilian population,  including Catholic Church leaders. It was the first step toward the  redemocratization of Brazil, in which the church played an important role.  </P> <P> The new spirit of ecumenism led to recognition by Brazil's Roman Catholic  bishops of the importance of establishing closer ties with other religious  groups, including Jews. A National Commission for Catholic-Jewish Dialogue was  organized by the Bishops' Conference, and met with Jewish community  representatives over five years, culminating in the publication of an  unprecedented document -- a 187-page manual for promoting discussion between  Catholics and Jews. The manual, distributed to every diocese and archdiocese in  Brazil, has served as a text for Catholic-Jewish dialogue and become part of  the life of the church and the Jewish community.  </P> <P> "Dialogue," says the manual, "is the best way for overcoming prejudices. It is  the best way for (Catholics and Jews) to know, listen and adopt new attitudes  of respect towards each other."  </P> <P> The Catholic Church and the Jewish community must keep in mind that in many  places around the world, both groups are at risk from extremism and bigotry.  Both of us need allies, even when we must differ with them. We wound ourselves  and hurt the cause of freedom when we break ties that took so long to build and  that promise hope of better relations and greater understanding after nearly 20  centuries of ignorance and fear.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Recommended Approach: CSAP invites applications that will permit CSAP to answer questions such as, but not limited to, those identified here:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. What combination of strategies is effective in developing communication, social, and life skills among youth at risk for becoming witnesses, victims, and/or perpetrators of AOD-related violence?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Which combination of strategies is effective in improving family functioning to reduce levels of family violence and AOD use?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. What combination of strategies is effective in promoting and sustaining the involvement of youth at risk for AOD-related violence in positive, pro-social activities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What strategies are effective in promoting a community-based approach to identifying and addressing the AOD-related problems in the target population?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Which strategies are suitable and effective in AOD-related violence prevention with sub-sets of youth (for example, by age, gender, race/ethnicity/culture) as well as with their families, schools, peers, and communities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. What strategies are effective in changing the behavioral norms that support violence in communities experiencing high rates of AOD use?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These questions are in addition to the ATOD-specific questions listed in the Outcome Evaluation section of part IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CSAP strongly recommends that applicants propose to implement comprehensive, community-based prevention strategies that address multiple risk and/or protective factors in three or more domains. Applicants may choose to target one or both of the designated sub-populations of high risk youth; that is, applicants may propose programs for 6 to 11 year olds and/or 12 to 14 year olds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants should design interventions to influence not only alcohol and other drug use and AOD-related violence, but also such associated conditions and outcomes as lack of neighborhood structure, lack of positive role-models, school drop-out, and vandalism.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Programs are asked to address risk factors outside the individual that can precipitate, precede, or co-exist with AOD use and AOD-related violence. Applicants are particularly encouraged to design prevention projects that involve significant persons in the youthful participant's family and social network, especially siblings.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time that programs should be comprehensive, they should also take into account the particular needs of individual program participants. Strategies should be developmentally appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Strategies must also be tailored to meet the cultural, linguistic, gender, and ethnic characteristics of program participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to ensure a community-based approach, applicants are requested to demonstrate that they have in existence a coalition consisting of community members who are willing and able to address relevant risk/protective factors. Representatives of the community, including youth, should be involved in identifying the relevant risk/protective factors and in developing the strategies to address them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants are encouraged to consider implementing improvements in the way services are delivered in their community to ensure that the local service delivery system can support the multifaceted, community-based prevention approach recommended for AOD and AOD-related violence prevention. For example, applicants should consider the need and appropriateness of linking and coordinating services through formal or informal agency and organizational agreements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

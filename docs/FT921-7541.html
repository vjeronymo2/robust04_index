			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): New terms for ambulance staff CLEVELAND Ambulance Service plans to break with national pay and conditions for its 350 employees when it becomes an independent trust in April, Lisa Woods writes. It wants to lengthen the working week from 39 to 42 hours and is offering paramedics and technicians pay increases of up to 13 per cent. Northumbria Ambulance Service, one of the few health trusts that has broken from National Health Service pay rates and industrial relations structures, also intends to make a locally determined pay offer in the next few weeks. Ambulance unions have recently lodged a claim for a 9.5 per cent pay rise and a reduction in the 39-hour week through the Whitley Council, the national negotiating body for health service staff. Cleveland Ambulance Service said yesterday that the first response from staff affected by the proposals had shown more than 60 per cent in favour. Nupe, the public-service union, disputed the figure. Mr John McDade, the local Nupe officer, said: 'People who have accepted the new terms and conditions may have done so under duress or misconception. The service has not told people that they are entitled to keep Whitley Council terms and conditions.' Trusts can impose terms and conditions on staff they recruit after gaining trust status, but under government rules they have to honour national terms for staff who transfer to a trust. Cleveland says it wants the new conditions to apply to all staff who agree to them. Mr John Burneside, chief executive of Cleveland Ambulance Service, said: 'Our manpower strategy is simple - fewer staff, working harder, getting paid more. We are a less complex organisation than a large acute hospital for example. We have identified our strategy and gone for it.' He said Cleveland had no plans to seek a single-union agreement such as operates in Northumbria.</p>

			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / Sanguine viewfrom the top: The head of Deutsche Bank talks to David Waller German businessmen are in the grip of panic, says Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank. This, says Mr Kopper, sitting in his eyrie at the top of one of the bank's frosty-blue twin skyscrapers in the heart of Frankfurt, is a typically overdone reaction. 'When something like this starts to happen - when the downturn begins to hurt - we Germans suffer from some specially Teutonic symptoms. We tend to panic, to get hysterical. But it isn't as bad as that. 'It's difficult out there, but I know we'll solve it. I'm sure that the mood is already changing.' Mr Kopper, appointed chief executive of Germany's biggest bank just over three years ago, says it is not surprising that Germans have become morose about the economy. He believes it is labouring under a triple burden. First, industry is suffering from a cyclical downturn - delayed by two years of rapid expansion fuelled by reunification. Deutsche Bank forecasts that western German gross domestic product is likely to fall by between 1.5 and 2 per cent this year. 'The downturn came about so quickly (in the autumn of last year), and the problem was made that much bigger in September because of the currency market turmoil, which, via the appreciation of the D-Mark, built another hurdle for German industry,' he says. Second, there are renewed concerns about Standort Deutschland - Germany as a place to do business. 'This has resurfaced in a vigorous way, after being submerged for a while under post-reunification euphoria,' Mr Kopper says. 'It involves everything - taxes, ecology, innovation policy, wage costs.' Third, Germany is facing structural change - a need to reshape several important industries. This challenge has become more pressing as a result of the increased competition arising from the creation of a single European market and from the penetration of low-cost imports from eastern Europe. This is especially true, Kopper argues, in the steel sector where, along with the UK, 'Germany is the only country in the EC to be facing a single market very much on its own, without state subsidies'. Solving all these problems at the same time will not be easy, Mr Kopper concedes. Economic recovery will involve unpalatable measures, including substantial job cuts across a broad swathe of industry. 'But there is a growing awareness that something has to be done, even among union members,' he says. 'The problems will be solved, because they have to be solved. There is no way round it. And it may do us some good. It will stop us from making similar mistakes in the east of our country, from indulging in what I call 'monument protection' - support for smokestack industries. 'Success with restructuring in the west may give us an opportunity to rethink some of the strategies developed by politicians for some of the old industries in the new Bundeslander. We should seize the chance to use all the money - currently intended to protect industrial dinosaurs  - to develop new industries for the future.' He believes that the country's politicians have made a significant contribution to restoring confidence within Germany by successfully negotiating a solidarity pact with unions and employers. This accord, concluded last weekend, includes limits for wage increases, government spending and financial support for eastern Germany. It is described by Mr Kopper as 'a great step forward'. He does, however, have reservations. He is disappointed that the pact included no real cuts in government spending. But he declines to go into detail about where he thinks the cuts should have been made. It is likely, however, that Mr Kopper has voiced detailed views on the pact to Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Like most of his predecessors at the head of Germany's most powerful financial institution, he has the ear of the country's leader on issues of economic policy. Potentially more significant for the reshaping of German industry, however, is the influence wielded by the bank through its web of industrial holdings. These include a 28 per cent stake in Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest industrial company, as well as 30 per cent of Philip Holzmann, the construction company, and 10 per cent of Allianz, Europe's largest insurance group. That influence is consolidated by a network of supervisory board directorships held by Deutsche Bank's 13-member management board. In total, Deutsche Bank board members hold more than 100 seats on German companies' supervisory boards - bodies which appoint and oversee company management. These investment holdings and management relationships are complemented by Deutsche Bank's financial strength. Its profits, which will be announced later this month, are expected to be about DM5.66bn (Pounds 2.4bn) - larger than the combined profits of the three next largest German banks. Critics say that such strength gives Deutsche Bank an excessive influence in German industry and its current restructuring. But Mr Kopper rejects such views. 'We take our part in finding and implementing industrial solutions and in making those solutions work. It is not our aim to make industrial policy,' he insists. 'That's what industry must do for itself.' He cites the case of Klockner Werke, the steel group which last December became the largest German company in more than a decade to file for protection from its creditors. Deutsche Bank, its largest creditor and 'house bank', devised the financial aspects of the company's survival plan. But Mr Kopper insisted that the 'managers must set the plan in motion themselves'. An even more significant corporate relationship is with Daimler-Benz, the country's biggest industrial group. The company's core automobile business is suffering a sharp downturn and - in the minds of industry analysts at least - there are serious question marks over the strategy of Mr Edzard Reuter, the chief executive who is seeking to build a broadly diversified 'technology' conglomerate. Mr Kopper says Deutsche Bank is not concerned with the details of the current restructuring at Daimler, which involves sharp job cuts and a change in strategy for Mercedes-Benz - the group's main profit source. 'We've had the Daimler stake for over 60 years and it's not our view to buy today and sell tomorrow,' he says. 'That's why we can take such a hands-off approach. Daimler is like a fund managing assets for us, of which we own a certain part. As the largest shareholder, we like to select the fund manager. 'As long as we're happy with what we see there, we'll stay out,' he says. Is he happy? 'I am happy,' Kopper growls. 'If I weren't, I wouldn't be non-executive chairman. And Edzard Reuter would not be chief executive.'</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Man in the News: Plaudits for the main contender - Kenneth Clarke / A chancellor who diets on common sense Mr Kenneth Clarke is just like the rest of us. He likes to be patted on the back. So in the aftermath of Tuesday's Budget the no-nonsense chancellor has been in more than usually expansive form. Entertaining at Downing Street, sipping from a chipped coffee mug in his House of Commons office or putting away a pint or three in the MPs' bar, Mr Clarke has basked in the applause for his debut. The only moment that he has looked disconcerted was when one of No 11's smart caterers offered him a pre-lunch glass of something called elderflower presse. Never mind that voters will eventually wake up to the biggest tax increase in living memory and discover that there is no money to build the village by-pass or new school promised for next year. This government lives by the day and week not the month and year. Mr Clarke was charged on Tuesday with rescuing Mr John Major's government. A public borrowing requirement of 8 per cent of national income - the level which forced Labour to call in the International Monetary Fund back in 1976  -had to be dealt with. But it had to be done in a way that did not give the Conservative party at Westminster an excuse for another collective nervous breakdown. The new boy at the Treasury - he has been there for only six months though it may seem longer - had also to present a plausible case that a return to fiscal responsibility would not stifle the still-fragile economic recovery. The judgment at Westminster was that Mr Clarke pulled off the trick. The right and left of the Conservative party were satisfied by the judicious mix of cuts in public spending plans and higher taxes. Tory MPs began to sound as if they had remembered that they belonged to the party of government not opposition. Some in the Treasury judged the Dollars 1bn plan to compensate the poor and the elderly for the imposition of value-added tax on domestic fuel ludicrously generous, but it did take the immediate political sting out of the issue. Even Mr Norman Lamont, his still-disappointed predecessor, had a good word for Mr Clarke's package. So too did Lord Lawson, not one to lavish praise where criticism will do. For all his self-confidence and experience of running big Whitehall departments, Mr Clarke resented jibes from city scribblers that he would be at sea at the Treasury because he had not been tutored in theoretical economics. True to his son-of-the-smokestack roots in the industrial Midlands, he sees economics as the application of common-sense policies according to a set of basic principles. Governments should hold down inflation and give industry a liberal, lightly regulated, environment in which it can expand. They should not borrow too much. They should keep marginal tax rates low (he still believes it, honestly), and act as a powerful force for free trade within what, as a good European, Mr Clarke is quite happy to call the Union. They should also move in from time to time to fill the gaps left by the market, such as education and training and help for small businesses. Stable exchange rates are a good idea because they allow business to plan ahead. So, too, would be a single European currency. You do not, as Mr Clarke might put it, have to spend your evenings buried in economics textbooks to apply such a common sense approach. So in the interests of brevity (he thinks it is possible to keep the attention of the House of Commons for no more than 90 minutes) he put a thick red pencil through the Treasury's traditional Budget lecture on the state of the world economy. But the Budget package was essentially political not just because Mr Clarke has a natural disdain for smart-Alick economists. The first big decision he took after arriving at the Treasury in June was that the budget deficit had to come down faster than envisaged in the medium-term plan set out by Mr Lamont in March. The new blueprint had to be delivered in November. Mr Clarke's reasoning was that a government which had rarely been in charge of events since it was elected 18 months ago might then claim to have restored its grip. Even the punters outside the precincts of Westminster might think that it was worth taking some pretty bitter medicine if the doctor appeared half-way competent. The second decision was that his first Budget would not be an occasion for fancy tax reform. He had more important things to do. Anyway, tax neutrality is not a phrase which trips easily from his lips. After the political uproar over VAT on fuel he had to find ways to raise money that would minimise the potential for yet another Tory revolt. Increases in the key rates of income tax were ruled out; so, too, a bit later was any further extension of VAT, even though Mr Clarke remains committed in the medium term to the switch from direct to indirect taxation. Instead, the chancellor chose well from the rest of the items on the Treasury's misery menu. Taken together, his tax increases will raise another Pounds 6bn or so by 1996-97. But each one has been selected to minimise Conservative opposition on the backbenches and among party activists. Many Tory MPs are fed up with the steep increases in petrol prices. The insurance and airline lobbies will ensure others grumble about the new airport and insurance taxes. But these are not issues worth going to the political stake for. Of course, the size of the reductions in public spending which allowed Mr Clarke to claim his Budget would knock another Pounds 18bn off the borrowing requirement by 1997 was partly fortuitous. His cabinet colleagues in the spending committee, known as EDX, were just as frightened of the implications of borrowing running at Pounds 1bn a week. They decided for once to behave responsibly. Another windfall came from the heroic assumption that some 5m public service workers would stand meekly by while increases in their pay are held below 2 per cent a year until the general election due by 1997. Mr Clark is standing by the spending figures, but the politician who took on the ambulancemen and very nearly lost is ready to admit that next year could see a bout of serious industrial unrest. He has moved swiftly to counter the idea that his Budget's planned cuts in benefits for the unemployed and the sick are the beginning of an assault on the welfare state. Messrs Michael Portillo, the chief secretary, and Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, have been powerful advocates in recent months of a fundamental shift in the burden of welfare provision from the state to individuals. Mr Lilley last week coined the clever phrase 'welfare society'. It is no accident that, after being slapped down by Mr Clarke, he has started to refer anew to the welfare state. On Wednesday the chancellor praised Mr Portillo's undoubted skill in co-ordinating the public spending round but then tilted at those on the Tory right who wanted to encourage old-fashioned family values. The chancellor seemed to be enjoying himself. But what next? Like the rest of us, Mr Clarke is not at all sure. He thinks that the Tory party will keep its nerve. Economists at the Treasury (and he does get on with them) say that the recovery is robust enough to withstand in the short term the dent to confidence caused by higher taxes and a squeeze on public spending. Inflation may be low enough now to get the government through the first year of the public sector pay freeze. But next April will be rough as the voters look at their pay packets and realise that the party which promised them tax cuts at the last election has done quite the reverse. And once or twice recently the Treasury's economists have been known to get it wrong. If the recovery falters then Mr Clarke's fine arithmetic for spending and borrowing will end up, with many other recent forecasts, in a Treasury waste bin. It is hardly a secure background for the local elections in May and the European elections a month later. For all their delight this week, Tory MPs fear heavy defeats in those elections might yet derail the government strategy for political recovery. But all that is for the future. This week Mr Clarke confirmed his standing as the cabinet's accomplished heavyweight. He has succeeded where the prime minister has failed in uniting, for a moment at least, the right and left of the Tory party. He insists that he has not thrown away his fundamental commitment to centre-left one-nation Toryism. But he has found a way to accommodate those who still grieve for Lady Thatcher. Mr Portillo confirmed himself as the cabinet's fastest-rising star, but if the bus which Mr Major has dodged so many times this past year were finally to actually hit the prime minister, then Mr Clarke would be the one who replaced him.</p>

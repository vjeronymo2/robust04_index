			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Lenders repossess fewer homes The number of homes repossessed by mortgage lenders in the first six months of the year fell to 25,020 - 6.5 per cent less than in the second half of last year - figures published yesterday show. Statistics from the Council of Mortgage Lenders also showed fewer mortgages in arrears. The council, which represents building societies and other lenders, such as banks, said that the improvements would be threatened by any reduction in social security payments that help the unemployed with mortgage payments. The figures showed that repossessions were at their lowest for a six-month period since the first half of 1990 - although they were still significantly higher than numbers of repossessions before that. Mortgages in arrears continued to decrease, although not as sharply as last year. There were 153,310 mortgages in arrears of six to 12 months at the end of June, compared with 164,620 at the end of December and 191,560 at the end of June last year. Mortgages in longer-term arrears also decreased - to 142,230 at the end of last month, compared with 151,810 at the end of December and 158,000 at the end of June last year. Mr Adrian Coles, the council's director-general, said that in a significant number of cases the level of arrears was being prevented from worsening because income support was paying the mortgage interest. He said: 'If the rumours of government plans to cut back income support are proved correct, the lifejacket which is currently keeping many households' heads above water will be taken away.'</p>

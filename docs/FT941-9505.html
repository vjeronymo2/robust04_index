			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Fuel blast lifts Haiti prices The price of black market petrol shot up in fuel-starved Haiti after a weekend explosion and fire destroyed a big depot for fuel smuggled into Haiti in defiance of a UN embargo, AP reports from Port-au-Prince. Fuel prices jumped from about 110 gourdes (about Dollars 8.50 or Pounds 5.80) a gallon to 135 gourdes since the blaze on Saturday night, according to checks at several sales outlets yesterday. Tens of thousands of gallons of fuel - increasingly precious in Haiti since the imposition of the UN embargo in October - were destroyed in the blaze that gutted a half-block of Rue de Cesars in downtown Port-au-Prince. Authorities reported no casualties, and all sides blamed carelessness rather than arson. The area near the Roman Catholic cathedral had been transformed into a dangerous stockpile of petrol, kerosene, diesel and other fuels. Most were kept in plastic jugs and drums, and vendors often smoked while working, even alongside trucks full of fuel parked on both sides of the avenue. Two fuel trucks blew up in the explosion, and at least 12 two-story buildings were destroyed in the fire. The army has stockpiled petrol in underground depots around the capital, but the fuel at the burned warehouses was the main source of sales to civilians. With legal importers observing the embargo, Haitians have been storing fuel in makeshift stockpiles throughout the capital. The fuel embargo was imposed to punish the army for blocking the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ousted and exiled in a 1991 coup. With Haiti's poor - Father Aristide's main supporters - already suffering the most by the embargo, an increase in fuel prices will make things worse for them.</p>

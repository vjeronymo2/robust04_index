			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria Jan 25 SAPA -- The constitution could still  be amended after the election to draw the Freedom Alliance into  the democratisation process, President F W de Klerk said on  Tuesday. Addressing a news conference in Pretoria, Mr De Klerk  said there was still hope an accord might be struck between the  Alliance, the government and the African National Congress  [ANC], adding there were some "sensible" proposals on the table.    His indications after Tuesday's extraordinary cabinet  meeting  for a report-back on Monday's trilateral talks were that "they  have moved relatively nearer to each other and that the  differences are bridgeable". "We will continue to make every  possible effort to ensure through negotiations their  participation is ensured," Mr De Klerk said. He stressed there  were time constraints but added the government was doing its  utmost to avoid negotiations coming to an end. Failure to reach  an agreement did not mean negotiations would necessarily come to  an end. "If there is firm multiparty agreement, amendments to  the constitution can then after the election become part of the  law of the land," Mr De Klerk said.    Turning to a possible boycott of the elections by the  Freedom  Alliance, Mr De Klerk said it would be a "most unwise" decision.  The ANC had tried that with the elections of the tricameral  parliament and had succeeded in bringing down the voting  percentages but could not stop the three-chamber parliament  which had made a tremendous contribution to the transition  process, he said. "Boycotting is an 'alien' method to use for  political parties when it comes to elections." The ANC had on  its election list a number of people who had been "trained" in  that very parliament, he added.    Mr De Klerk said he intended to probe the "weak spots"  reflected in the ANC's election candidate list but would not  elaborate further. He said he would proclaim the elections at  the "earliest possible moment".</p>

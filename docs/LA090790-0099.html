			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTY D.A. GROUP VOTES 'NO CONFIDENCE' IN REINER  </P> <P> An organization representing Los Angeles County prosecutors announced Thursday  a vote of no confidence in Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner's removal of a veteran  prosecutor from the Menendez brothers murder case -- an unprece-dented action  by the group.  </P> <P> The board of directors of the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys voted  unanimously to rebuke Reiner Wednesday night after both Reiner and former  Menendez prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Elliott Alhadeff, appeared before the  group. Five of the 18 board members were absent.  </P> <P> A one-sentence press release from association president David Ross said  Thursday that the association "lacks confidence in the district attorney's  judgment" in pulling the prosecutor off the case that has drawn worldwide media  attention.  </P> <P> Alhadeff, 52, a 24-year veteran of the office, earlier was selected to be  honored next week as the association's prosecutor of the year.  </P> <P> He was removed as lead prosecutor on Aug. 16 and replaced by Deputy Dist. Atty.  Pamela Ferrero, one of the prosecutors in the second McMartin Pre-School  molestation trial.  </P> <P> Reiner was unavailable for comment, but his spokeswoman, Sandi Gibbons, said  Alhadeff was pulled from the case after several briefings with Reiner. "The  district attorney has a responsibility to the people of Los Angeles County to  put the best possible prosecution team on a case," Gibbons said. "That's what  he gets paid for."  </P> <P> However, Gibbons would not say what Reiner's problem was with Alhadeff, who has  won a string of court decisions favorable to the prosecution.  </P> <P> Lyle Menendez, 22, and his brother, Erik Menendez, 19, are charged in the 1989  shotgun murders of their wealthy parents. In the early phases of the  investigation before the brothers were arrested and charges filed, Ferrero was  assigned to the case. She had to give it up when she was tapped for the  McMartin retrial.  </P> <P> The association has no power over Reiner, except in the arena of public  opinion, and has been supportive of the district attorney. The board voted to  endorse Reiner over incumbent Robert Philibosian when Reiner first won office  in 1984 -- a major boost for his campaign.  </P> <P> And when Reiner announced plans to seek reelection in 1988, he was encircled by  smiling members of the Assn. of Deputy District Attorneys board, which endorsed  him again.  </P> <P> Opinion is divided on whether the group's new willingness to publicly criticize  Reiner is an isolated incident, an indication of deep dissatisfaction within  the office or the result of his vulnerability after his defeat in the state  attorney general primary in June. Most board members contacted by The Times  refused to comment for the record.  </P> <P> "First of all, it should be understood the action that the board took is  absolutely unprecedented," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Marsh Goldstein, a board  member.  </P> <P> Ross said the removal of a respected prosecutor from a high-publicity case --  without stating the reasons -- is "bad for morale" and calls Reiner's  competence into question. . . . We question his judgment."  </P> <P> Ross characterized the vote, which followed a spirited discussion, as  significant. "It's a major move . . . to disagree publicly with your boss."  </P> <P> Ross, Alhadeff and other members of the association board emphasized that their  dispute was not with their fellow prosecutor, Ferrero.  </P> <P> As Alhadeff tells it, he was called into Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Greg  Thompson's office the day before leaving for vacation. A press release  announcing his removal was read to him. The office's official position was that  Ferrero wanted the case back.  </P> <P> Upon returning from vacation, Alhadeff said he found that many of his  colleagues were upset on his behalf. In the past few days, Alhadeff met with  Thompson, then with Reiner.  </P> <P> He said he was told his competence was not at issue. "I walked in there  concerned it may be a reflection on my competence and reputation and walked out  of there being assured it was not. . . . I think there may have been a  personality problem," Alhadeff said.  </P> <P> If so, Alhadeff said, it was a problem he did not know about until it was too  late. "I'm disappointed I was removed from the case," he said.  </P></p>

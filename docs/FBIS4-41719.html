			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Dushanbe 28 June TASS -- A border patrol in one of  the sectors of the Moskovskiy border guarding detachments was  fired upon from automatic weapons from Afghan territory on  Monday night, sources at the department of Russian border troops  in Tajikistan told ITAR-TASS on Tuesday [28 June].    Fire was intensive enough, but, luckily, none of border  guards was hurt. The border guards did not return the fire, the  sources said.    The situation in the other sectors of the Tajik-Afghan  border  remains rather complex but is controlled by Russian border  guards.</p>

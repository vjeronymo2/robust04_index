			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Coal sales 'may be boosted' BRITISH COAL'S sales to the two big power generators could be 15m tonnes greater than envisaged under the present pit-closure plans, the former commercial director said yesterday. Mr Malcolm Edwards told the Commons trade and industry committee that British Coal would have to get its price down from Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 1.33 a gigajoule to achieve those sales in the face of competition from other sources. But British Coal was already aiming to reach that price in the new five-year contracts being negotiated. These are based on sales of 40m tonnes, falling to 30m over the period. The other key condition would be measures to prevent the power generators running down their stocks. Those stood at about 33m tonnes but the generators wanted to get them down to 20m, he said. He said the government should have the power to oblige generators to maintain higher stocks, although he agreed that they would need greater working capital to finance them, and that might drive up the price of electricity. British Coal would also have to accept two-year rolling contracts rather than the five-year deal it was offering. Mr Gerard McCloskey, publisher of a coal industry information service, told the committee that the scope for enlarging coal's market might be even greater - more than 25m tonnes. He believed that the UK's imports of French electricity, equivalent to 7.5m tonnes of coal, could be reversed and turned into a similar amount of exports to countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy. He urged that Nuclear Electric's ageing Magnox reactors should be closed down, creating scope for an additional 9m to 11m tonnes of coal-based power. He believed those measures might save half the 31 pits threatened with closure.</p>

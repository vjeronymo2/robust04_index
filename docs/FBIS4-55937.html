			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 24 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government  today approved the Slovak Republic's Defence Doctrine. "The  doctrine puts emphasis on the closer relations with and later  membership of West European and Transatlantic security  structures," Defence Minister Pavol Kanis told Slovak Radio. He  said the document would be valid until the time when Slovakia  joins Western structures and assumes their doctrine.    The initial draft doctrine was approved in March by the  cabinet of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar but then the doctrine was  reworked on the basis of remarks raised by the parliamentary  committee. The document setting the goals and principles of  Slovakia's security policy is to be valid for a time of  Slovakia's participation in the Partnership for Peace project.    "The Slovak Republic actually has the weakest potential of  the armed forces, the weakest economic and human potential and  it is therefore a pre-condition for the success of our defence  to join a system of collective security. Our successful foreign  policy is becoming a guarantee of our security," he said.    At its session today, the government also discussed a  presentation document to serve as a basic material for drafting  an individual programme of Slovakia's cooperation with the North  Atlantic Alliance within the Partnership for Peace project.  Kanis said that on the basis of the defence doctrine and the  presentation document the concrete defence and security policy  will be implemented by the end of the century.    The presentation document will be submitted to a NATO  Council  meeting in Brussels by Kanis on Wednesday [25 April]. The  political document on the Slovak Republic's joining the  Partnership for Peace project was signed this February in  Brussels by ex-Premier Meciar.</p>

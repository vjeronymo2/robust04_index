			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> L.P. REPERTORY HAS A HUSKY ANGEL  </P> <P> Former Rams defensive back Johnny Johnson, now a member of the Seattle Seahawks  organization, is rooting for the financially strapped L.P. Repertory in Tustin.  And he is bringing former teammates with him tonight to see the current  production, "The Night of January 16th," says theater manager William Durkin.  Why the interest? Johnson's wife, Julie Gray, is playing one of the major roles  in Ayn Rand's courtroom drama. It is part of an effort to improve attendance at  the dinner theater, which is about a month behind in its $8,100 monthly rent,  Durkin said.  </P></p>

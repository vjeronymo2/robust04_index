			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Accounting changes obliterate Tiphook's profits SHARES in Tiphook fell by 27p to 259p after the UK transport rental company announced a change in accounting policy which wiped out its profits. Mr Robert Montague, chairman, said accounting policy was being changed to reflect the increasing number of US shareholders. The proportion of the group's equity held as American Depositary Receipts has risen from 2 per cent in 1991 to just over 50 per cent. About 65 per cent of the group's Pounds 1.16bn borrowings are in the US. Annual profits before tax and various charges fell from Pounds 86.4m to Pounds 55.5m, in line with analysts' reduced expectations. However, Tiphook said that from now it would report in dollars and the results would more closely reflect US accounting conventions. The group said applying the new accountancy policy led to predominantly one-off charges of Pounds 77.3m, giving a pre-tax loss of Pounds 21.8m in the year to April 30. Turnover increased marginally from Pounds 322m to Pounds 324m. One analyst said the changes 'just muddy the waters further'. The drop in the proportion of UK shareholders - from 60 per cent to less than 30 per cent of the equity - reflects the disgruntlement of UK institutional investors, who have seen the group's share price halved in less than two years. Their tolerance has also been tested by share price falls ahead of two recent company announcements - a profits warning in April and last week's notification of the proposed accountancy changes. Some shareholders have pressed for more non-executive directors and expressed concern over the high remuneration enjoyed by executives. Mr Montague said there were no plans to change the board. Tiphook would remain UK domiciled. He added that US investors seemed more comfortable with leasing companies such as Tiphook, which although heavily geared were strongly cash-generative. Operating cashflow in the year had been Pounds 163.9m, down 13 per cent. Tiphook said its biggest business, containers, had shown resilience to the recession. Utilisation had averaged 82 per cent, compared with 88 per cent, but average rental rates fell by less than 2 per cent. Under the new standard, there was a loss per share of 41.2p, compared with earnings of 46.3p. A final dividend of 14.4p gives a total of 21.2p, against 19p. Lex, Page 20</p>

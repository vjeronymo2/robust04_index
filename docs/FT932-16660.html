			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Revised small-business loan scheme delayed BANKS SAY that the revamped small-business loan guarantee scheme, announced in the Budget last month as one of the measures to speed recovery from the recession, will not be ready until October this year. In addition, the scheme's new Pounds 250,000 ceiling will not be universally available, applying only to existing businesses. Start-ups will be limited to the scheme's old ceiling of Pounds 100,000. The scheme enables small businesses to raise bank loans when security is not available. Under the existing scheme the government guarantees up to 70 per cent of a loan and the borrower pays a 2.5 percentage point premium on the interest rate. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced that the level of eligible loan would rise by Pounds 150,000, with the maximum guaranteed portion rising to 85 per cent. The premium will be cut to 1.5 per cent for variable-rate loans and 0.5 per cent for fixed-rate loans. About 20 lenders, including the large clearing banks, many smaller banks and small-business advisory and finance bodies, take part in the scheme. The delay in the start of the new scheme was greeted with surprise and dismay by corporate finance advisers. Mr Peter Folkman, head of North of England Ventures, a venture-capital fund backed by Schroders, said banks had been telling applicants they would have to wait until October. The Department of Trade and Industry said: 'We are not so pessimistic as to think it will be October. We think it will be brought in sooner than that, but we cannot be certain when at this stage. It takes time to make the arrangements with the banks.' But Mr Ian Templeton, senior partner of the Manchester office of Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm, said that DTI officials in Sheffield had told him the scheme would start in October. North of England Ventures had hoped that the scheme would enable Panel Signs, a Nottingham management buy-out in which it has Pounds 550,000 invested as equity for a 60 per cent stake, to trade its way out of trouble. Now, it said, the company would almost certainly close this month - with the loss of 60 jobs - because it could not bridge the gap to the new scheme's introduction. The company makes illuminated signs for businesses such as supermarkets and filling stations. The DTI confirmed yesterday that the existing ceiling would apply to start-ups, and that the new limit was to help established businesses.</p>

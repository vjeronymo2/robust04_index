			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Banks may sell O&amp;Y stakes AN INTERNATIONAL group of banks is examining ways to dispose of the majority shareholdings, worth more than CDollars 1bn (Pounds 512m), which they control in Abitibi-Price, one of the world's biggest newsprint producers, and Gulf Canada Resources, the Canadian energy group. The shares are nominally owned by Olympia &amp; York, the crippled property developer, which pledged them as collateral for a USDollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.6bn) syndicated loan from the banks. But under a debt-restructuring plan which took effect last month, the lenders have effective control of almost all O&amp;Y's shares. Options being considered include seeking new 'strategic' shareholders willing to buy a substantial block of shares in either company, and a distribution of shares through an international public offering. The banks, led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, have appointed Salomon Brothers of New York and RBC Dominion Securities of Toronto to advise them on the best way of maximising the value of their collateral. Representatives of the two investment banks have already interviewed Abitibi and Gulf executives and are expected to submit a report to the banks within the next month. The timing of a sale is uncertain. At current share prices, the banks would fall far short of recouping the full amount of their loan. The 79 per cent stake in Abitibi pledged to the banks is worth about CDollars 780m. Of O&amp;Y's 75 per cent interest in Gulf Canada, the 70 per cent stake provided as security is valued at just over CDollars 520m. Abitibi is gradually recovering from a deep slump in the North American forestry industry. However, Gulf Canada continues to experience severe financial problems. Gulf, which has a debt load of CDollars 1.6bn, lost CDollars 252m from continuing operations last year and has suspended dividends. HSBC provided Dollars 750m of the syndicated loan. Other participants were Credit Lyonnais, Commerzbank, Royal Bank of Canada and Dai-Ichi Kangyo. In anticipation of a change in ownership, Abitibi and Gulf - in consultation with the banks - have each named three new directors to replace members of O&amp;Y's Reichmann family and their nominees. The same three people have been appointed to each board.</p>

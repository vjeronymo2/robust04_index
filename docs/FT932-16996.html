			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz poised to begin manufacturing in US MERCEDES-BENZ, the Ger-man luxury car manufacturer, is likely to announce next week that it is to make an important shift of strategy and start manufacturing in the US, following the lead set by rival BMW. Mercedes, the car division of Daimler-Benz, is due to hold a news conference in the US on Monday at which analysts expect it to announce plans to build a sporty, four-wheel drive vehicle in the US. The company yesterday declined to comment. Mr Helmut Werner, the Mercedes management board chairman, said two months ago that a US plant 'was a high, high priority. BMW broke ground last September for a new Dollars 400m plant in South Carolina after a three-year world-wide search for a suitable manufacturing site outside Germany. The plant is to produce a new model for both the US and export markets. The German companies want to manufacture in the US partly because of lower production costs there than in Germany, partly to protect themselves against currency swings, and partly to revive their fortunes in the US - the world's largest car market. Sales of German cars have been hit by tax changes, the arrival of Japanese luxury car manufacturers and a revival in Detroit's competitiveness. Analysts speculated yesterday that Mercedes intended to plump for North Carolina as the site of its new plant. The company's Freightliner subsidiary, the US market leader in heavy trucks, already manufactures in the state, which is a favourite for German companies with US subsidiaries. Manufacturing in the US would hold risks for Mercedes. It is unclear whether American buyers of the company's cars would regard their engineering and construction quite so highly with a 'made in the US' tag on the vehicles, rather than German origin. However, car buyers have been demonstrating an increasing resistance to paying the high prices demanded by Mercedes for German prestige. Audi, the up-market division of Volkswagen, is due to decide later this year on whether to build a North American plant.</p>

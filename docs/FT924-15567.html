			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Too reserved by far How perfectly silly of the Treasury to come up with September reserve figures so obviously designed to confuse. There is not much point in seeking to disguise, after the event, the amount spent to support sterling in the run-up to Black Wednesday's devaluation. The superficial impression from the underlying Dollars 7.7bn fall in reserves was that the Bank of England spent considerably less than the supposedly grudging Bundesbank in defence of the pound. Nor does it help the gilts market to massage the intervention figure down. It would simply conclude that less PSBR funding had been tucked away than previously thought. The City, however, is far from hoodwinked. It can stick to intervention estimates of some Pounds 15bn, knowing that the Treasury left itself plenty of room for obfuscation by not declaring the extent of short-term borrowings from the Bundesbank. Admittedly, if these are repaid by purchases of D-marks in the market rather than refinanced with borrowing, the intervention will no longer count as PSBR funding. That creates considerable uncertainty. More generally the authorities' obsession with secrecy hardly instils confidence in future currency management. The nagging worry that the authorities may actually have something to hide was probably a psychological factor behind sterling's 4.5 pfennig fall. It did not help that the Bundesbank left its interest rates unchanged, although there is a nuance to this disappointment. The German central bank is now stressing its desire to see money market rates below 9 per cent and downplaying M3 growth as a monetary indicator. That could be the first glimmerings of an easier policy. But it will be some time before lower German rates bring much scope for UK easing. Sterling's weakness suggests the authorities must be wary of any unilateral cuts.</p>

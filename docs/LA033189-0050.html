			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AS GRIFFEY JR. STARTS OUT IN SEATTLE, GRIFFEY SR. HANGS ON IN CINCINNATI  </P> <P> For the first time in major league baseball history, a father and son will be  playing at the same time this season.  </P> <P> Ken Griffey Jr., 19-year-old son of veteran major leaguer Ken Griffey Sr., will  be the Seattle Mariners' starting center fielder this season, Manager Jim  Lefebvre said.  </P> <P> "He won the job," Lefebvre said. "He deserves it."  </P> <P> Griffey's father, 39, is back with the Cincinnati Reds, with whom he played in  the 1970s and the last two months of the 1988 season. The Reds signed Griffey  to a one-year contract Thursday.  </P> <P> Lefebvre called Griffey into his office in Tempe on Wednesday and told him he'd  made the big leagues. "I told him that this was the most difficult decision a  manager has to make," Lefebvre said. "I told him that I had talked to the  coaches, and we had taken a lot of things into consideration. Then I told him  he had made the team . . . that he was my starting center fielder."  </P> <P> Griffey made the jump from double-A to the major leagues with a sensational  spring. He was elated at the news from Lefebvre. "Those probably are the best  words I've ever heard . . . at least in the top three," Griffey said.  </P></p>

			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Paris deal on electronics industry THE embattled French government has agreed on the details of a much scaled-down version of controversial plans for a restructuring of the state-owned electronics industry. It is understood that under the revised scheme, the CEA-Industrie nuclear energy and reactor building group would take minority stakes in the loss-making Thomson Consumer Electronics video and audio equipment maker, and in SGS-Thomson, the semiconductor group jointly owned with the Italian state sector. The original version of the plan, launched last December, envisaged a complete merger between CEA-Industrie and the civil electronics businesses of Thomson. However, this ran into resistance from CEA-Industrie's management. This compromise is the result of arbitration by Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, the powerful director of the French Treasury, who was called in to resolve the deadlock.</p>

			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Arms-for-Iraq inquiry recalls witness A BRITISH military adviser is to be pressed this week by the arms-for-Iraq inquiry about the extent to which Saudi Arabia and Jordan were used to reroute British defence equipment to Iraq in the 1980s. The inquiry will today and possibly tomorrow take evidence from Lieutenant Colonel Richard Glazebrook, a retired army officer who was a member of a Ministry of Defence working group which vetted defence sales. Liet Col Glazebrook has been recalled to expand on earlier evidence. On June 11 he said that other members of his ministry and other government departments had ignored his warnings about the growing export of defence-related equipment to Iraq. In evidence to the public hearing of the Scott inquiry last Tuesday Sir Stephen Egerton, the former UK ambassador to Saudi Arabia, recalled how he had been called in by a Saudi prince who angrily complained about the way a contract with the British defence company Allivane had apparently been delayed. Sir Stephen said the prince was a partner in Aerotech Saudi, the local office of Aerotech, the name adopted by Allivane before it went into liquidation in 1989. The former ambassador refused to name the prince publicly but passed his name to Lord Justice Scott. Contacted at his home at the weekend Sir Stephen said he was still refusing to name the prince 'for diplomatic reasons', and regretted having given the name to the judge. He was not prepared to comment on the Allivane contract. He confirmed, however, that all defence equipment supplied to the Saudi armed forces was delivered by sea to the Saudi military port of Khudima. A former director of Allivane who did not want to be named said the company had negotiated a contract for the supply of 155mm artillery rounds to Saudi Arabia with Prince Sultan Bin Turki Bin Abdulazziz, a nephew of the present ruler of Saudi Arabia, King Fahd. The Saudis had complained about the delay in the contract. It is thought that the contract was granted an export licence from the Department of Trade and Industry on the basis that the goods were destined for Saudi Arabia. The former director said: 'As far as we were concerned the possibility of the goods going on to Iraq was never discussed. But it is always possible that the Saudis arranged onward shipment themselves.' Mr Christopher Muttukumaru, an assistant Treasury solicitor who has been seconded as secretary to the Scott inquiry, said that Lord Justice Scott was not prepared to release the name of the Saudi prince as it did not consider that to do so served the public interest. However he added that Lord Justice Scott was continuing his inquiries regarding Allivane and would decide eventually whether to name the prince in his report. 'There is no question of keeping the name secret . . . if the judge thinks it is relevant to publish the name in his report he will . . . he is independent of government ,' Mr Muttukumaru said. Classified Whitehall documents which have been examined by the Scott inquiry show that at a meeting on the February 15 1988 Ministry of Defence officials were concerned that an Allivane contract with Saudi Arabia, believed to involve 155mm ammunition shells, may have had Iraq as its ultimate end user.</p>

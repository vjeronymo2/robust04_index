"The Bosnian crisis was a test of the firmness of our course  in the world which showed the true potential of the Russian  foreign policy", Yeltsin said at a meeting with Moscow teenagers  studying in military colleges.    "In close cooperation with the United Nations and our  partners we shall boost the peaceful offensive. The objective  is that the ceasefire in sarajevo becomes a breakthrough to  peace in the whole of Bosnia", the president stressed.    The crisis tested "our capability to resolutely defend the  national and state interests of the country. Russia, as a UN  Security Council member, as an equal participant of the  community of democratic states demonstrated its right to  participate in adopting key decisions of the world politics...  which concern its lawful interests and international  obligations. Our voice was heard in the world", the president  said.    "The mechanism of partnership with the West was also tested.  Although not immediately, with faults, but it did work", the  president said adding that Russian stance on dialogue and  cooperation with leading powers of the world has justified  itself.    "The Sarajevo crisis has also spotlit the correctness of our  course towards all-round strengthening of the United Nations as  the major international organisation in ensuring peace", Yeltsin  stressed.    As a result a ceasefire in Sarajevo was achieved without a  further escalation of the military conflict, according to the  president. "The logics of peace must, finally, win over  nationalistic emotions which brought the peoples of  Bosnia-Herzegovina to the top limit of human sufferings",  Yeltsin said.    The president expressed hope that the conflciting sides  would  stand up to their commitments, ensure a reliable ceasefire and  avert provocations against international peace-keepers,  including the Russian force in Sarajevo.</p>

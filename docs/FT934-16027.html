			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Arts: Marlowe's Dido, Queen of Carthage - Theatre There is a school of thought which believes that if Christopher Marlowe had not died young - at the age of 29 in 1593 - he would have surpassed even Shakespeare as a dramatist. On quantity perhaps; on quality I doubt it. It may be unfair to accuse Marlowe of lacking a sense of humour, since he concentrated on writing tragedies. What he certainly lacked was Shakespeare's sense of variety, but he wrote some of the most magnificent blank verse in the English language. There is another claim that should be treated with scepticism. Stage One Theatre Company says that theirs is the first professional production of The Tragedy of Dido, Queen of Carthage for 400 years. That sounds a bit like the crime figures: not everything is recorded. There must have been some productions, somewhere. Yet one can see why there may not have been very many. Dido was probably Marlowe's first play - no-one is quite sure of the date and there may have been some collaboration with Thomas Nashe. As a drama, it is not the most gripping. It relies heavily on Virgil's Aeneid and has some excessively long speeches, though one of them is specifically commended by no less than the Prince of Denmark in Shakespeare's Hamlet. The quality of the verse is on a learning curve, but from a pretty low starting point. Take, for example, the bathetic early lines of Aeneas: 'Achates, 'tis my mother that is fled; I know her by the movings of her feet.' One cannot say much for the ending either, when it is Aeneas who has fled and everyone else to speak of is dead on stage. Shakespeare would have left someone behind to tell the story. Nevertheless, Dido has Marlowe's stamp on it, is an interesting part of his development as a dramatist, and it is enterprising of the Stage One Company, directed by Michael Walling, to have revived it. My own main impression is how rapidly the verse matures as the play goes on. There is a great deal of feeling in some of Dido's last lines, some of it foreshadowing the uniqueness of Marlowe at his best. For instance: 'And all the world calls me a second Helen, For being entangled by a stranger's looks.' On the other hand, one cannot speak for other people. My daughter said that she preferred the first half because she had never seen anything like it before. The second half merely reminded her of what a good play is Antony and Cleopatra. Up to a point she was right, yet without Dido Shakespeare may not have written Antony the way he did. There are some remarkable parallels between Dido's and Cleopatra's femininity. The experience is more educational than entrancing. I doubt if even the best acting in the world could make much of the piece as a whole. As it is, Kevin Costello plays Aeneas with a touch of the ham, which is probably the best way of doing it. Julie Saunders' Dido gets better as tragedy approaches and with the maturing of the verse. There is the definition of a pretentious programme note by Inga-Stina Ewbank, who is a professor of English at the University of Leeds. It ends: 'The professional stage has fought shy of this play for nearly 400 years: it may not be coincidental that it now returns in the year when we have learned to speak of 'former Yugoslavia''.

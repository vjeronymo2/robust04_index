			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Mitterrand raises the stakes - Referendum gamble aims to exploit divisions on Europe among France's conservative opposition THE Danish 'No' vote is a serious setback for the European strategy of President Francois Mitterrand - but it is a disaster for France's conservative opposition parties. As the leading architect of the Maastricht treaty on European union, the president yesterday responded to the Danish vote by raising the stakes in a high challenge. He promised that French ratification of the treaty would also be through a referendum. Also, in a statement with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, he reiterated their determination that ratification must go ahead as planned this year. Their statement confirms the driving role assumed by these two leaders since the Maastricht negotiations started over two years ago. At their last summit, at La Rochelle two weeks ago, they said they were determined that Maastricht should go ahead, whatever the result of the Danish referendum, with 11 member states, or even with 10. Mr Mitterrand's unhesitating decision to press ahead with ratification could turn out to be a high-risk gamble. On balance, French public opinion is in favour of the European Community, and recent polls suggest that more French people support than oppose the Maastricht treaty. But the attempt to force through ratification after it has been rejected by Danish voters, may well agitate public opinion and intensify feelings of anxiety about Europe which have recently appeared. The regional elections last March revealed a huge increase in votes for various protest parties, from the extreme right-wing National Front to the two ecology parties and the Hunting, Shooting and Fishing party, not to mention the rump of the Communist party. To a greater or lesser degree, each of these can be classed as anti-European, and together they mustered nearly 40 per cent of the vote. If you add in the anti-European wing of the Gaullist party, and waverers in other mainstream parties, you could reach a total which might threaten ratification in a referendum. But the challenges and difficulties facing Mr Mitterrand's administration are as nothing compared with the potential political disaster now bearing down on the conservative opposition parties. They have long been divided on the subject of European integration, there being the pro-Europeans in the Centrist and the UDF parties, and the anti-Europeans in the Gaullist party. Every day, these divisions are being jemmied wider and wider by the Maastricht debate, and the intensification of controversy now in prospect will split them down the middle. Last month, in the first phase of the Maastricht ratification in the National Assembly, almost all the Centrist and UDF members voted in favour of the necessary reform of the French Constitution - but only five Gaullists did so, while 31 voted against and 88 abstained. The surprising thing is that the anti-Europeans in the Gaullist party are so passionate in their hostility to the Community, that they do not seem to realise that the Maastricht treaty has become the central weapon in President Mitterrand's strategy to regain political ground from his conservative opponents. The essential significance of Maastricht for Mr Mitterrand is its importance in the new phase of building a more integrated Europe. There is little doubt that the president regards this treaty as the culmination of a long commitment to European integration, and a suitable legacy for the end of his presidency. But it is also a powerful instrument for waging war against his enemies, because it searches them out where they are most divided. Yesterday, the unconditional opponents of the Maastricht treaty, such as Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Pierre Mazeaud of the Gaullist party, plus the Communists and the National Front, were all jubilant at the result of the Danish referendum, and demanded that the French ratification be immediately stopped. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the Gaullist party, who took refuge in abstention in the National Assembly debate last month, yesterday remained silent. By contrast, almost all the leaders of the Centrist and UDF parties insisted categorically that the ratification must continue. The only prominent conservative who seemed to show any awareness of the political danger ahead, was Mr Alain Lamassoure, the UDF spokesman on Europe, who urged a meeting between party leaders of government and opposition. President Mitterrand cannot be sure that there is any way to ratify the Maastricht treaty in its existing terms. Nor can he be sure that he would secure a majority in a popular referendum, though it is likely. But if he keeps up the process of constitutional revision and ratification, he can be fairly sure that by the end of the process, some time in the autumn, the conservative opposition parties will be in tatters.</p>

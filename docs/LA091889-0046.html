			<p><P> September 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> 'REVOLUTIONARY" GAS ADDITIVE  </P> <P> Chemists at the Texaco Research Center in Beacon, N.Y., have developed what  they call a "revolutionary" new package of engine additives that can clean up  both the car's carburetor or fuel injection system and interior motor parts  without increasing the engine's octane requirement. Texaco has recently begun  marketing the additive package as part of its System-3 gasoline. The additive  should be particularly useful in small engines and in high-performance engines  in European luxury cars, according to chemist Rodney Sung of Texaco.  </P> <P> Most gasolines contain organic chemicals that, when heated, can produce  deposits on metal surfaces. Such deposits in the carburetor and intake valves  reduce the flow of air and fuel into the engine, thereby degrading  acceleration, fuel economy, power and cold-start drivability while increasing  emission of nitrogen oxide pollutants. Most manufacturers put detergents into  gasoline to clean up these deposits, but the detergents themselves cause  deposits in the motor's interior, thereby raising the engine's octane  requirement.  </P> <P> Texaco's new additive package is unique, Sung said, in that it cleans up both  intake deposits and interior deposits. Studies on engines in test stands and  cars show that the additives both prevent buildup of such deposits and remove  those caused by use of other brands of gasoline, he said.  </P></p>

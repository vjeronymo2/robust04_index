			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Arts: Today's Television John Betjeman was great television so there are high hopes for an Omnibus profile (BBC 1, 10.55) of this tortured but likeable man, who moved from revolutionary to diehard with charm and aplomb. His reputation has risen since his death and there are enough friends and enemies around to cast insights on his life. This is preceded by 'The Riff Raff Element', one of my favourite programmes of 1993 and given a reassuringly swift return in this new series. The Belchers are common; the Tundishes are gentry, and their lives have somehow intermeshed. But no cheap points are scored and all the characters have their own quirky individuality. Coal (BBC2, 9.50) is another report on the death of the mining industry, this time with the added poignancy that Charles Stewart and Malcolm Hirst have taken their fly-on the-wall approach to the pits in Nottinghamshire, the recruiting ground for the Union of Democratic Miners, which helped the government break the miners strike of 1984 but which now faces the closure of its own pits. The first of six episodes in a sorry tale.</p>

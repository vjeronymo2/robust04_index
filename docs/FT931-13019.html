			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / Danish foreign minister makes Maastricht pledge MR Niels Helveg Petersen, who took over as foreign minister in Denmark's four-party coalition government yesterday, said his top priority would be to secure a Yes vote for the Maastricht treaty on European union in the second Danish referendum, to be held later this year. 'I regard it as my foremost task to achieve a Yes in the referendum and to ensure that the Danish presidency of the European Council is carried out satisfactorily,' he said yesterday. 'We shall make every effort to see that the presidency, which has been well prepared, goes well.' Mr Petersen, 54, is the most senior cabinet appointee from the Radical Liberals, one of the small centre parties in the new government coalition. He will play a key role in the European Community in coming months during the six-month EC presidency which Denmark assumed at the beginning of the year. He succeeds former foreign minister and Euro-enthusiast, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. The new cabinet was announced yesterday by Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the new prime minister and chairman of the Social Democratic party (SDP). Mr Petersen said the new government had not set a date for the referendum but he thought a date 'before June' was probable. Mr Petersen's Radical Liberal party has a record of being sceptical towards European integration, but the foreign minister said that he had advocated a Yes to the Maastricht treaty in last year's referendum. He said he did not think his European credentials could be doubted. The new cabinet is the largest in Denmark's history with 24 members. Several ministries have been split up to create enough portfolios to meet the requirements of the coalition of the SDP, the Radicals, the Centre Democrats and the Christian People's party. SDP politicians given key posts included Mr Mogens Lykketoft, minister of finance, and Mr Hans Haekkerup, minister of defence. Mr Jann Sjursen, Christian party, becomes the youngest cabinet minister, at 29, taking the energy ministry.</p>

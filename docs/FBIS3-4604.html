The Patriot missile under  consideration for deployment in Korea are Pae-II type, the  latest operated by the U.S. military that has been advanced from  the weapons used in the Gulf war, Yi told the National  Assembly's National Defense Committee.    Considering that not only Seoul, but also as far as Suwon is  within missile attack from the North, it is meaningless to  operate the anti-missile weapon in the capital just to intercept  North Korean Scud missile attack, he explained. Therefore, he  added, Seoul and Washington are considering to use Patriots to  defend airport, port, command post, and other military areas.    The U.S. Forces in Korea will be in charge of maintaining  and  operating the missiles and Seoul does not need pay any extra, he  said. The defense minister said purchasing the missiles was  another matter and needed to consider more over a long time  before reaching that stage.</p>

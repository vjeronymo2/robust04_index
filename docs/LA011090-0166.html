			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SENNA CAN'T RACE UNTIL HE RETRACTS ALLEGATIONS  </P> <P> Ayrton Senna of Brazil, the 1988 Formula One world champion, will not be  allowed to race on the Grand Prix circuit this year unless he retracts his  criticism of the International Automobile Federation, the federation's  president said today.  </P> <P> Senna has charged that he was manipulated out of any shot at the 1989 world  driving championship so that Frenchman Alain Prost would win it. Senna's hopes  for the title ended when he was disqualified in the Japanese Grand Prix, the  next-to-last race of the season.  </P> <P> "The council will not grant a 1990 super license for the season so long as he  doesn't change his statements or alter the lies and detriment he caused to  FISA," federation President Jean-Marie Balestre said. FISA is the International  Federation of Auto Sports, the governing body of Formula One racing.  </P> <P> Balestre cited a code of conduct regulation requiring all drivers to respect  the decisions of the sport's governing body.  </P> <P> Senna finished first in the Japanese race but was disqualified for taking a  short cut after a collision. He bitterly disputed the ruling.  </P> <P> "It is clear that political and economic pressure groups manipulated behind the  scenes to make Prost this year's champion," Senna said at news conference in  Sao Paolo, Brazil, on Nov. 10.  </P> <P> He charged that the manipulation was orchestrated by "Jean-Marie Balestre, who  out of patriotism, friendship or for other reasons I prefer not to mention,  wanted to see Prost as champion."  </P> <P> Balestre said that he met Senna in December in an effort to make peace but that  his bid for "reconciliation with Mr. Senna was to no avail."  </P> <P> Senna and his lawyer presented their case in a session with the World Motor  Council the next day "to explain his slander and his statements," Balestre  said.  </P> <P> He said he and members of the world council are very upset by Senna's refusal  to back down from his statements.  </P> <P> "The international federation showed Mr. Senna there was no manipulation in the  event," Balestre said. He said the race stewards were correct in disqualifying  Senna from the Japanese race.  </P> <P> Senna's McLaren team appealed the disqualification, but the decision was upheld  by the international tribunal. FISA presented a report labeling Senna as a  dangerous driver and listed past incidents in support of its charge.  </P></p>

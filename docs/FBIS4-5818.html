			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong-sun,  secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea and chairman of the Reunification Policy Committee of the  Supreme People's Assembly [SPA] of the Democratic People's  Republic of Korea, at the talks held here today between  officials of the SPA Reunification Policy Committee and former  heads of state and government and politicians of different  countries, informed the guests of the situation of Korea and the  DPRK's stand toward national reunification and the DPRK-U.S.  relations and its foreign policy.    "Our singlehearted unity of the whole society is the most  valuable wealth of ours and nothing can break it," he said.    Noting that a powerful independent national economy had been  built in the DPRK, he said:    "Some people are now threatening to impose `economic  blockade' on us. But it does not work with us."    "Powerful self-defence capacities have been built up with  the  chuche idea applied in the field of national defence," he said,  and added:    "The nature of our-style socialism centred on the popular  masses in which the chuche idea has been applied is peace. But,  it is ready to cope with the situation when our sovereignty is  violated or the supreme interests of the country encroached on.    "It is attributable entirely to the great ideology and the  great leadership that everything is going well in our country.    "The leader devotes himself to the popular masses and the  latter remains faithful to the former. So, it is natural that  everything is going well. It is the steel-like faith of our  people that they will surely win as they are guided by Comrade  Kim Chong-il, supreme commander."    Kim Yong-sun continued:    "We constantly maintain that the question of national  reunification should be solved independently and peacefully on  the principle of great national unity.    "If the national reunification question is to be resolved,  many issues must be solved. First of all, peace must be ensured  on the Korean peninsula. To this end, disarmament must be  achieved and problems solved between the DPRK and the United  States."    Recalling that the United States had reversed the agreed  conclusions reached at the DPRK-U.S. talks and the New York  contacts and aggravated the situation in a bid to stifle the  DPRK under the pretext of the "nuclear suspicion," he said:    "We want to solve the issue through negotiations with the  United States with patience. If the United States persistently  sought a solution with strength, however, we will be left with  no other choice but to do our own way.    "It will be favourable to the United States itself that it  look squarely at the world tending toward diversification and  the changing situation and act with discretion.    "The basic idea of the foreign policy of our party and the  DPRK Government is independence, peace and friendship. We will  as ever consistently implement this policy."    The talks proceeded in an atmosphere of mutual  understanding.</p>

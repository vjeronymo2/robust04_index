			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HARVARD FALLS IN WATER POLO SEMIFINAL, 13-3  </P> <P> Harvard High's hopes for a third consecutive trip to the Southern Section water  polo final came to a quick end Saturday.  </P> <P> Top-seeded El Toro scored on its first three shots en route to a decisive 13-3  win over the fourth-seeded Saracens in a 3-A Division semifinal game at Santa  Monica High. The win puts the defending 3-A champions into Wednesday's title  game against Capistrano Valley, a 7-6 winner over Marina in the other  semifinal.  </P> <P> "We just didn't play well at all," Harvard Coach Rich Corso said. "This was an  old-fashioned butt kicking. We were tentative the first 14 minutes."  </P> <P> El Toro Coach Don Stoll instructed his team to put early pressure on Harvard  All-American goalie Larry Bercutt.  </P> <P> While El Toro was shooting bullets at Bercutt, the Saracens weren't even firing  blanks at Charger goalie Eric Terwilliger.  </P> <P> "We didn't even take a shot until the end of the second quarter," Corso said.  "We just weren't aggressive enough."  </P> <P> El Toro (25-5) built a 6-0 lead before Hasan Yardimci got Harvard (27-5) on the  scoreboard 55 seconds before halftime. But any thoughts of a comeback were  dashed in the third quarter as the Chargers scored four unanswered goals.  </P></p>

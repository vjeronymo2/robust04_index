			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sanaa, Feb 1 (AFP) -- The authorities in Yemen have  told tribesmen holding three French tourists hostage for more  than a week to free them "immediately" in exchange for pledge to  look into demands for a road into the tribesmen's remote  mountain fief.    Reliable Yemeni sources said the government had given the  promise in a letter signed by 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-'Ansi, deputy  prime minister and general secretary of the Islamic  fundamentalist Al-Islah party and by fellow deputy prime  minister Mujahid Abu-Shawarib.    Abu-Shawarib is himself a native of the region where the  three French tourists are being held about 200 kilometers (120  miles) north west of Sanaa.    The letter was due to be delivered late on Monday to the  mountain village of Al-Madhan more than eight hours by road and  trail from the capital.    The move follows a decision announced on Sunday by the  al-Hashid tribe whose territory adjoins Al-Madhan to halt  supplies of food to the rebel village in order to force the  kidnappers into surrendering.    The men who seized the French tourists belong to the smaller  Ahnum tribe who claim to be penalised because the only road to  their enclave goes through al-Hashid territory with the result  that often their farm produce is confiscated.    A road to be built in the region was initially due to go  through Ahnum territory but was later diverted to go through  al-Hashid land.    A report in the English-language YEMEN TIMES Monday said the  ministry of public works had come under strong pressure from the  al-Hashid tribal chief Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar who  is also president of parliament to re-route the road so as to  skirt the Ahnum enclave.    The letter delivered Monday reportedly said "the path of the  road will be reexamined if the French hostages are released."    Henri Haslot and his wife, both retired agronomy teachers in  their seventies and 42-year-old Brigitte Fontaine were kidnapped  at gunpoint on January 23 as they were travelling on the road  from Sa'dah in the extreme north of Yemen.    A French foreign ministry spokesman Monday said the three  were "well treated and in good health".    The YEMEN TIMES showed a photograph of the three French  tourists sitting smiling with a village man at their side.    The paper said there had been at least 11 similar cases in  the past three years, and that all of them had come to a  negotiated settlement.    It said several countries had advised their nationals not to  go to Yemen unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>

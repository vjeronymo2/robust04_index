			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: HK Bank's O&amp;Y exposure set at Dollars 787m HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank, one of the largest single creditors of Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Canadian property developer, said its total exposure to O&amp;Y was Dollars 787m, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Hongkong Bank rebutted suggestions it was a large lender to the Canary Wharf development in London, saying its exposure to that project was less than Dollars 9m. The bulk of its advance to O&amp;Y had arisen from its participation in a Dollars 2.5bn syndicated loan to Olympia &amp; York Resources Credit Corp. The syndicate effectively has a first charge over O&amp;Y's 71 per cent stake in Gulf Canada Resources and 82 per cent interest in Abitibi-Price, pulp and newsprint manufacturer. The current 'loan-to-market value ratio' of these two assets was around 66 per cent, the bank said. This suggests that Hongkong Bank may have to provide up to Dollars 270m if the underlying assets were sold at current values.</p>

			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAPERBACKS  </P> <P> THE BIG BOOK OF HELL By Matt Groening (Pantheon: $15.95). Before Bart Simpson  became as ubiquitous as Snoopy, Matt Groening dispensed his irreverent humor in  the weekly comic strip "Life in Hell," which he continues to draw.  </P> <P> This anthology surveys the 10-year history of the strip, beginning with the  first appearances of Binky, the alienated rabbit; Sheba, his girlfriend, and  Bongo, his one-eared illegitimate son. Groening uses this unlikely cast to  satirize contemporary American culture, from the pretensions of the performance  art/poetry scene to the excesses of Reagan-era politics. (Bongo asks his  father, "If you vote Republican, does that make an accomplice to their  crimes?") In recent years, Akbar and Jeff, the identical entrepreneurs in  fezzes, have taken over the strip, and their topsy-turvy gay love affair has  become has become the crazed mirror of contemporary relationships.

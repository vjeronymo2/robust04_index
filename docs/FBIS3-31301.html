			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi by </F> correspondent Bujar Muharremi in Tirana; date not given -- live  or recorded]    [Text] [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, you recently made an  official visit to Greece and met your counterpart Papoulias.  Was this visit conducted in the context of relations with  Greece in its capacity as head of the EC Presidency, or were  there other problems associated with relations and the regional  situation?    [Serreqi] The meeting was not bilateral. It was a meeting  held in the context of Albanian relations with the European  Union. Of course, the Greek foreign minister presented the  invitation, but on behalf of the EC Presidency. The meeting  aimed at discussing the results achieved so far in Albania's  cooperation with the EU and the prospects for this cooperation.    The meeting was mostly characterized by a real climate of  understanding. I should stress that the results of the reform  in Albania and those of Albania's cooperation with the EU were  very positively assessed. Besides this problem, we discussed  the crisis in the region, as well as joint programs of future  cooperation, the PHARE [Economic and Reconstruction Aid for  Poland and Hungary] and inter-EC programs. We also discussed  other problems of a political nature.    [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, what was the attitude of the Greek  side regarding the crisis in the region?    [Serreqi] In general, the positions were pretty far removed  from each other. The discussion resembled the confrontation of  viewpoints we presented in Geneva several days ago. Of course,  we stressed two or three main points, such as that we do not  consider the division of Bosnia into three ethnic units to be a  fair and permanent solution that serves peace. We believe that  the recent NATO decision, the final ultimatum, should be  supported, and the Albanian Government fully supports it. Our  positions were not consistent with those maintained by the Greek  Government.    [Muharremi] Mr. Minister, at the news conference held in  Athens, you were questioned about the Albanian Government's  opinion on the stability of The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia. Can you please tell us something about this problem?    [Serreqi] That was not the question. The question was  related to the Congress of the Party for Democratic Prosperity  in Macedonia and the answer was very clear. The answer was  this: Interstate relations have nothing to do with interparty  relations. Albania has been very clear in its policy toward  Macedonia. Albania has recognized Macedonia for reasons that  are already known. At the same time, we will never stop until  Macedonia guarantees all legitimate rights to Albanians living  there.</p>

			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Chesterfield Properties shows 48% fall to Pounds 6.7m PRE-TAX PROFITS of Chesterfield Properties fell by 48 per cent, from Pounds 12.78m to Pounds 6.7m, in the year to end-December. The company attributed the decline to the ending of capitalisation of interest charges on the completed Five Acre Square and Rochdale developments. Turnover rose from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 38.6m and comprised Pounds 33.9m (Pounds 27.9m) from rental income, Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 1.9m) from property dealing and Pounds 4.62m (Pounds 5.45m) from cinema, theatre and other activities. The annual revaluation of the group's investment portfolio showed a deficit of Pounds 91.6m. This included a further provision against Chestergate House, a development property. The net asset value per ordinary share fell by 47 per cent from 1,017p to 534p, or by 41 per cent from 965p to 572p fully diluted. Mr Roger Wingate, chairman, said the principal cause was the collapse of rental values in central London. The group's West End portfolio fell by 25 per cent, and the City and Southwark properties by 37 per cent. In the case of the City,this was aggravated by the continuing 45 per cent vacancy at Five Acre Square. Provincial properties performed better, he said, the downward movement being 3.5 per cent for shops and 2.5 per cent for offices. The interest charge (including capitalised interest) showed a slight fall from Pounds 26m to Pounds 25.3m. Profits after tax and minorities showed a modest rise from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 3.9m, mainly as a result of a lower tax charge. Earnings per share came out at 12p (10.83p) or 17.17p (16.24p) fully diluted. The final dividend is maintained at 11.5p for a same-again total of 18.5p.</p>

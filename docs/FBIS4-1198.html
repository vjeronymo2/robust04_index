			<p>BFN     [Text] The defense force has denied allegations that the  Bothaville commando is involved in right-wing security  arrangements at Viljoenskroon in the [Orange] Free State.  Earlier this week right-wingers began erecting road blocks and  watchtowers at the town. The defense force said in the  statement that the commando was implementing a nationwide  instruction to assess the situation in military commando areas  to prepare for any eventuality after the election. The SADF  [South African Defense Force] also rejected claims that the  commando had been paid by the Viljoenskroon town council.</p>

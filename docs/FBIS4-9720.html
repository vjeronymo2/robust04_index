			<p>BFN     [Text] Bernard Sansaricq, president of the [unofficial]  Senate Office, says the Senate will analyze the proposal of the  political leaders delegation headed by Hubert De Ronceray. On 29  March, the [Coordinating] Committee for National Mobilization  submitted a resolution to the Senate from those opposed to  Aristide asking that Article 149 of the Haitian Constitution be  implemented. Mobilization for National Development leader Hubert  de Ronceray has stated that, should the parliament fail to  follow up on this request, an ad hoc government will be formed.    Sansaricq intends to gather the senators, or at least the  members of the Alliance [for Parliamentary Cohesion] and the  parliamentarians who were elected on 18 January, to discuss the  issue.    [Begin Sansaricq recording] The conversation, which lasted  nearly an hour, was very cordial. We took note of the text that  was submitted to us by this delegation, and we hasten to inform  the public that this resolution will be submitted to the members  of the Senate for approval as soon as possible, disregarding the  formality regarding three full days mentioned in the text of the  resolution.    At this crucial moment in the national life, the Senate of  the Republic is willing to look into, examine any and all  resolutions aimed at bringing about a reasonable solution to the  serious crisis the nation is experiencing.

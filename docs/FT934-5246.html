			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Ferruzzi creditors approve rescue plan Bank creditors representing more than 85 per cent of the total borrowings of Italy's Ferruzzi group yesterday gave their approval to a controversial rescue plan drawn up by leading Italian lenders. Reaching the 85 per cent level means shareholders' meetings to approve the recapitalisation of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company and Montedison, its main industrial subsidiary, will go ahead as planned today and tomorrow. Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank behind the rescue plan, and Mr Guido Rossi, Ferfin chairman, had stressed the restructuring could be put at risk if the 85 per cent level was not reached. Securing the agreement of enough creditors became a virtual certainty yesterday after Deutsche Bank, one of the main critics of the restructuring plan, broke ranks with other leading foreign creditors and accepted the proposal. The decision, ostensibly for 'political' reasons, weakened the front of non-Italian banks, which opposed the Mediobanca scheme when it was presented last month. In contacts with other foreign creditors, Credit Suisse said efforts to prepare an alternative scheme would continue, in spite of Deutsche Bank's decision to resign from the committee of five foreign banks. The other banks include Barclays, Union Bank of Switzerland and Citibank. Last night, the four remaining banks repeated their refusal to be railroaded into a settlement. They said 'such a complex plan cannot be the object of careful revisions and consideration within the very short time requested by Ferruzzi'. Credit Suisse said the foreign banks' group would meet on Wednesday and hoped to share its conclusions with other foreign creditors before Christmas. The Mediobanca plan calls for moratoria and below-market rates on interest payments on Ferruzzi group borrowings, as well as reschedulings of most debts. Ferfin had net borrowings of L22,600bn (Dollars 13.4bn) at the end of June. Last week, Mediobanca issued an 'updated plan' which went some way to meeting foreign banks' criticisms by removing a number of companies, to which foreign banks were most exposed, from the rescheduling proposals. Shareholders in Ferfin and Montedison will be also asked to approve legal action against Price Waterhouse, which audited the two companies. The boards of Ferfin and Montedison say the firm failed to spot severe financial irregularities which allegedly arose under the previous management.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tim Cohen] </F>   [Text] Cape Town -- Provincial Affairs officials expect  that it will take up to a year before provincial governments  pass their first budgets. Department sources said the long  delay in the establishment of functioning provincial governments  was inevitable considering the need to amalgamate some regional  authorities and to split others.    The comments came as ANC local government negotiator  Thozamile Botha was on Monday [30 May] appointed chairman of the  commission on provincial government by Provincial Affairs and  Constitutional Development Minister Roelf Meyer. SAPA [South  Africa Press Agency] reports he will be assisted by former MEC  [Member Executive Council] and NP [National Party] member Tjol  Lategan.    The commission is to facilitate the establishment of  provincial governments and advise the Constitutional Assembly on  developing provincial constitutions. Other members are R.  Jager, P. Lephunya, T.R. Benecke-Jordaan, P. Daphen, N.N.  Gwagwa, D.E.T. le Roux, J. Malatji, Y. Muthien, Z. Titus, T.  Tlhacoane, J.W.A. van der Merwe, V. Vedlanker and M. Webber.  Only Botha and Lategan will serve in full-time capacities.    The departmental sources said although "those in the know"  realised it would take time before provincial governments were  up and running, the extent of the difficulties involved was not  foreseen. The holding of provincial and national elections  simultaneously was a "political decision" which did not take  into account the likelihood that the provincial administrations  would take time to be established.    However, representatives of provincial governments have  since  expressed frustration at the time it will take before they will  be able to exercise their powers, but national government  representatives say the delay is unavoidable.    Meanwhile, regional bureaucracies will be required to  continue delivering their existing services, as stipulated by  the constitution.    During the interim period, provincial governments will not  be  able to change existing structures without the backing of the  national government. Pivotal in the process will be the  establishment of the financial and fiscal commission, which will  recommend the division of tax income between the national and  provincial governments.    The constitution states that provinces may levy taxes -- but  only after they are authorised to do so by an Act of Parliament.  The provinces will be entitled to "an equitable share" of  national revenue once Parliament has fixed these amounts.    The allocation of national tax revenue will be made after  the  national interest and the recommendations of the financial and  fiscal commission have been taken into account, the constitution  states.</p>

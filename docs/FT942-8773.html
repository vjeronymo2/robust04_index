			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Japan postpones public sector price rises Japan's new minority government is to delay until the end of the year an estimated Y460bn (Pounds 2.9bn) worth of public sector price rises. Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata's decision comes in response to intense corporate criticism of increases in charges for a range of services, from motorway tolls to telephone bills. They were put forward by several government ministries during the political confusion of recent months in an attempt to compensate for the decline in tax revenues caused by the recession. However, the Nikkeiren employers' federation had complained that the price rises would be a blow to consumer confidence, which is struggling to recover from the longest economic downturn since the second world war. Mr Takeshi Nagano, the Nikkeiren's president, said yesterday he was 'glad for the sake of the nation' that the government had changed its mind. Mr Hiroshi Kumagai, the chief cabinet secretary, said the freeze would only apply to prices rises not already implemented, including telephone bills, public housing rents, taxi fares, national motorway tolls and fire insurance premiums. The government had not yet calculated the economic impact, but expected consumer sentiment to benefit, he said. Ms Mineko Sasaki-Smith, chief economist at Morgan Stanley's Tokyo office, estimated yesterday that Y460bn worth of charges would be frozen and that Y1,841bn of price rises - including alcohol tax and postage stamps among other things - had already taken effect or gone too far to be reversed. If fully implemented, the price increases would have been worth Y2,301bn net. This would have wiped out 40 per cent of the Y5,850bn tax rebate agreed by the former government of Mr Morihiro Hosokawa in February. 'This shows how too much reliance on the bureaucracy can produce proposals that are not politically viable,' said Ms Sasaki-Smith. Clearly, the price freeze will improve the cabinet's weak popularity score, 42.4 per cent according to a poll by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun economic newspaper yesterday. The increases were hard for the public to accept when consumer prices are rising by a mere 0.8 per cent annually and wholesale prices falling by 3 per cent. Ironically, the last time the government froze public sector prices was in 1974, in an attempt to curb inflation. The price rises were believed to have the blessing of the powerful finance ministry, keen to prevent an erosion of its revenues when a divided coalition is unable to agree on ministry-inspired plans for a rise in consumption tax. According to finance ministry projections, the government must cut spending by more than Y7,000bn annually in the three years from 1995, if it is to keep expenditure in line with revenues and avoid 'excessive' dependence on bonds. By that, the ministry means it wants to reduce bond revenues as a proportion of total government income from the present seven-year high of 18.7 per cent to 5 per cent by the end of the decade. Separately, parliament yesterday agreed a second stop-gap budget for the coming year, worth Y10,890bn and covering the period until the end of the parliamentary session on June 29. The first provisional budget, which expires tomorrow, was needed because the collapse of the Hosokawa government last month has delayed the full-year budget, due to have come into effect on April 1.</p>

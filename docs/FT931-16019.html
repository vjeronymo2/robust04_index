			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Health chairman resigns SIR JAMES Ackers has resigned as chairman of West Midlands regional health authority, which has been the subject of criticism for inadequate financial controls. A National Audit Office report in October found that a consultancy exercise intended to generate Pounds 50m savings had cost the authority some Pounds 4m. Expenditure on the consultant's expenses, said the report, included leased houses in London for executives and their wives, chartered aircraft and lavish entertainment. West Midlands regional health authority, the report added, had sometimes paid invoices without seeing supporting bills. After compilation of the NAO report Sir Roy Griffiths, deputy chairman of the National Health Service policy board, was sent to the West Midlands to strengthen management controls. Sir James, 57, had been chairman of England's biggest regional health authority since 1982 and received Pounds 20,925 a year for the part-time role. He said in his resignation letter to Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary: 'Now that the task of rectifying matters is almost complete, I am quite certain that it is in the interests of the regional health authority to have a clean sheet and a fresh start.' Mrs Bottomley responded by speaking of Sir James's valuable contribution and many improvements in the West Midlands. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, called on Mrs Bottomley to make a full statement when the Commons returns next week. Sir James will be replaced temporarily by Sir Donald Wilson, chairman of Mersey regional health authority.</p>

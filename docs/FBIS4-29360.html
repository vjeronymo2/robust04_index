			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 16 KYODO -- The Finance Ministry will  allow nonlife insurance companies to issue domestic convertible  bonds (CBs) for the first time in almost five years in line with  deregulation in the financial sector, ministry sources said  Thursday [16 June]. The move will be welcomed by nonlife  insurance companies that are gaining interest in procuring  funds. A convertible bond is a bond that can be converted into  the shares of a company at a fixed price.    Koa Fire and Marine Insurance Co. is seen issuing 30 billion  yen in CBs as early as July, while Yasuda Fire and Marine  Insurance Co., and Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. are  predicted to follow suit.    The ministry has so far restricted the issuance of CBs to  prevent nonlife insurance firms from easily raising funds and  making investments, the sources said. The CB market has been  weak since the burst of the "bubble economy," but it is now  showing signs of improvement. Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance  Co. was the last nonlife insurance firm to issue CBs, in July  1989.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Rationale for Individual Criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exclusion Area. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An exclusion area surrounding the immediate vicinity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the plant has been a requirement for siting power reactors from the very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beginning. This area provides a high degree of protection to the public from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a variety of potential plant accidents and also affords protection to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant from potential man-related hazards. The Commission considers an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusion area to be an essential feature of a reactor site and is proposing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to retain this requirement for future reactors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule issued for comment in October 1992 proposed a minimum  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distance to the exclusion area boundary of 0.4 miles (640 meters), based upon  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the suggested value given in Regulatory Guide 4.7, without utilizing source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> term and dose calculations. This was based upon a conservative evaluation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the performance of fission product cleanup systems such as containment sprays  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or filter systems. Numerous comments were received stating that source term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and dose calculations should be retained, and that the exclusion area distance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should also be based upon a more realistic evaluation of actual fission  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product cleanup systems. In response to these comments, the Commission is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing, in the present rule, to retain the use of source term and dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculations, in part 50, to verify that an applicant's proposed exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area distance is adequate to assure that the radiological dose to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual will be acceptably low in the event of a postulated accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, as noted above, if source term and dose calculations are used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conjunction with standardized designs, unlimited plant tradeoffs to compensate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for poor site conditions would not be permitted. For plants that do not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve standardized designs, the source term and dose calculations would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to provide assurance that the site is acceptable for the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> design.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The present regulation requires that the exclusion area be of such size  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that an individual located at any point on its boundary for two hours  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> immediately following onset of the postulated fission product release would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not receive a total radiation dose in excess of 25 rem to the whole body or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 300 rem to the thyroid gland. A footnote in the present regulation notes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a whole body dose of 25 rem has been stated to correspond numerically to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> once in a lifetime accidental or emergency dose to radiation workers which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could be disregarded in the determination of their radiation exposure status  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (NBS Handbook 69 dated June 5, 1959). However, the same footnote also clearly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> states that the Commission's use of this value does not imply that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considers it to be an acceptable limit for an emergency dose to the public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under accident conditions, but only that it represents a reference value to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for evaluating plant features and site characteristics intended to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigate the radiological consequences of accidents in order to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance of low risk to the public under postulated accidents. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission, based upon extensive experience in applying this criterion, and in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognition of the conservatism of the assumptions in its application (a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fission product release within containment associated with major core damage,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum allowable containment leak rate, a postulated single failure of any of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the fission product cleanup systems, such as the containment sprays, adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> site meteorological dispersion characteristics, an individual presumed to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> located at the boundary of the exclusion area at the centerline of the plume  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for two hours without protective actions), believes that this criterion has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly resulted in an adequate level of protection. As an illustration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the conservatism of this assessment, the maximum whole body dose received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an actual individual during the Three Mile Island accident in March 1979,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which involved major core damage, was estimated to be about 0.1 rem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the proposed rule, the Commission is proposing two changes in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, the Commission is proposing that the use of different doses for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the whole body and thyroid gland be replaced by a single value of 25 rem,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total effective dose equivalent (TEDE). The total effective dose equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concept is consistent with part 20 of the Commission's regulations, and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined as the deep dose equivalent (for external exposures) plus the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed effective dose equivalent (for internal exposures). The deep dose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equivalent is the same as the present whole body dose, while the committed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effective dose equivalent is the sum of the products of doses to selected body  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organs times weighting factors for each organ that are representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> radiation risk associated with that organ.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Parity pays Pounds 8.3m for ACT's systems business ACT, the Birmingham-based computer services group, has taken a further step in its transformation into a financial software products company with the sale for Pounds 8.3m of its systems integration and training interests. The buyer is Parity, formerly Comac, an information technology staff agency and services group headed by Mr Philip Swinstead. The acquisitions, ACT Business Systems, ACT Business Systems (Ireland) and BIS Training, will help Parity achieve its objective of becoming a broadly based computing services company. The total cost includes the repayment of Pounds 3.8m of intra-group debt. Some Pounds 6.3m will be payable on completion and the remainder on the second anniversary of completion. The consideration will be met through a placing and open offer, fully underwritten by Samuel Montagu, to raise a net Pounds 5.7m, The balance will be met from Parity's existing resources. ACT, which took over the BIS Group last year, has been selling off non-core activities as it concentrates on software products for the financial sector. The company is likely to have annualised revenues of about Pounds 170m; last year it achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 28.5m. Market worries over the cost of restructuring and product development have hit the share price, however, which closed yesterday at just over 100p. Parity intends to create an new division, Parity Systems, to complement its existing consultancy, training and agency operations. With the acquisitions, annualised turnover is likely to reach about Pounds 120m. Mr Swinstead said: 'In 12 months our small agency company has been transformed into a significant IT services business.' Parity Systems will be managed by Mr Keith Jennings, recruited from Easams, part of GEC. The marketing director will be Mr George Waddington.</p>

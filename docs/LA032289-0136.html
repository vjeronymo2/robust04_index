			<p><P> March 22, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUSPECT SEIZED IN DEATH OF GIRL FOUND IN GRIFFITH PARK  </P> <P> A 27-year-old Garden Grove man, who police say posed as a schoolteacher to lure  a Santa Ana schoolgirl into his car, was arrested outside his home this morning  on suspicion of the girl's slaying.  </P> <P> Jose Antonio Gonzalez was taken into custody at 9:45 a.m. and was being  questioned at the Santa Ana Police Department in connection with the abduction,  sexual molestation and strangulation of 9-year-old Nadia Puente. Her body was  found stuffed in a trash can in Griffith Park on Tuesday morning.  </P> <P> Police Chief Paul M. Walters said teams of police officers worked 43 hours  straight after Nadia's abduction Monday and linked Gonzalez to the crime  through a wealth of physical evidence.  </P> <P> Police would not release his photograph on advice of the district attorney's  office, but authorities said Gonzalez matched the description that witnesses  gave of Nadia's abductor: a Latino in his early to mid 30s with short, curly  hair and a goatee. Gonzalez's car also matches the description of a small gray  car with a black stripe on the sides, as reported by witnesses, police said.  </P> <P> Police said they watched Gonzalez leave his apartment at 11750 Euclid St. this  morning, get into his car and begin to drive away. They then stopped and  arrested him, police said.  </P> <P> Gonzalez lives about four miles from where Nadia was abducted, near Diamond  Elementary School.  </P> <P> Walters said Gonzalez posed as a schoolteacher when he stopped his car Monday  afternoon and asked Nadia to help him.  </P> <P> "The fact that he alleged that he was a schoolteacher and wanted the girl to  carry some books" seems to suggest that Nadia did not know him, Walters said.  </P> <P> Police said a number of other people were in Gonzalez's apartment at the time  of the arrest, but it was unclear whether they are linked to the case.  </P> <P> "There are other suspects, but they are very few -- I'd say a handful," Walters  said, adding that police feel "very, very confident that this is the person  that perpetrated this crime."  </P></p>

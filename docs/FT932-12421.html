			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Shareholders in Petrofina deny stake sale plan PETROFINA'S two largest shareholders yesterday made clear they were not planning to sell their stakes in the Belgian oil and gas company, and would work together to encourage the group's development. Mr Albert Frere, Petrofina chairman and head of Groupe Bruxelles Lambert, the Belgian holding company which controls a 21.5 per cent stake in the company, said he wanted to 'cut short' speculation surrounding Petrofina. That speculation has centred on a 4.9 per cent stake in Petrofina built up by Elf Aquitaine, the French state-controlled oil company. Elf's presence has buoyed the Petrofina share price with rumours of a possible takeover. But Elf repeated in a statement yesterday that its holding was 'a financial investment, which was neither unfriendly nor hostile in character'. Mr Frere, who controls a further 6.55 per cent of Petrofina through private companies, was addressing shareholders at an extraordinary meeting called to approve a series of defensive measures. At the same meeting, Viscount Etienne Davignon, chairman of Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding company, said the group was 'solidly behind' GBL in its support for Petrofina. He confirmed that La Generale had no intention of selling its 11.33 per cent stake in Petrofina, which is Belgium's largest industrial company. The shareholders were unable to adopt the defensive measures, which would bring Petrofina in line with recently implemented Belgian company legislation, because they represented only a minority of the shares. The proposals will now be put to the vote at the May 14 annual meeting, where a quorum is not necessary.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 3 Apr (DPA) -- Today, the Guatemalan  National Revolutionary Unity [URNG] condemned the assassination  of Epaminondas Gonzalez Dubon, president of the Guatemalan  Constitutionality Court. The URNG said this "abominable  incident" undermines the human rights agreement signed with the  government. According to a URNG communique published in Mexico  City, the magistrate's assassination "bluntly reveals the  opposition that exists within government sectors, particularly  within the Army, to the Global Agreement on Human Rights," which  was signed in Mexico City on 29 March.    Gonzalez Dubon died in the early hours of 2 April as a  result  of an attack in downtown Guatemala City by several unidentified  men who shot him while he was driving home. Police have called  the attack an "apparent robbery attempt," but several prominent  members of the political and legal professions pointed to death  squads as possible culprits.    In its communique, the URNG said the assassination of the  Constitutional Court president "is aimed at limiting the role of  the people, which had been opened by the aforementioned  agreement in the area of human rights." The communique added:  "It is important for the government of President Ramiro de Leon  Carpio and the Guatemalan Army to completely fulfill without  delay the promises made to the Guatemalan people and the United  Nations as the only way to uproot repression, assassination, and  barbaric acts from our fatherland."    The URNG also demanded that the security corps and the  Guatemalan Army be purged "of the assassins opposed to peace and  human rights" and deemed that "thorough measures, not just  publicity and cosmetic measures," are needed. Meanwhile, the  guerrillas also called on the United Nations, the mediator in  the peace talks between the government and the URNG, to send a  preparatory mission for the verification of human rights to  Guatemala "without delay" as established in the agreements  signed in Mexico City.</p>

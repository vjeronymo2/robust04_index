			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Letter: Only having our leg pulled Sir, When reading John Hopkins ('Pride of Lions with an English accent', March 20) explaining his choice for the British Lions - with only two Irishmen in a squad that would include 21 Englishmen - I must confess I thought him slightly arrogant, especially as he said his selection was 'strictly on merit'. Later that day, after Ireland beat England 17-3, I realised it was a leg-pull, so I apologise to him for my earlier unworthy thought. Philip Jacob, Abingdon, Shankill, Co Dublin</p>

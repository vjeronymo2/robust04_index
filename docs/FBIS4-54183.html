			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 26 KYODO -- Japanese Foreign Minister  Koji Kakizawa voiced hopes Thursday [26 May] that Japan will be  awarded the veto powers held by Britain, China, France, Russia  and the United States if it is admitted as a permanent member on  a revised UN Security Council [UNSC].    "It is okay for us to join the ranks of the permanent  security council countries in the future, provided veto powers  are not abused or exercised serving the ego of the big powers,"  Kakizawa said.    Kakizawa made the remarks in response to a question by  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) legislator Setsu Shiga during  Thursday's session of the House of Representatives Budget  Committee.    The foreign minister apparently aims at closing ranks with  Germany, another candidate for permanent membership in the key  UN body, which already declared it will accept a permanent seat  only if given full veto powers.    The current council groups five permanent seats held by the  major victors of World War II and 10 nonpermanent seats, which  are rotated every two years among member states of the United  Nations.    With its veto, a permanent member can block any council  decision.    While most of the five have voiced support for Japan's and  Germany's bids to become permanent members, they have not made  it clear whether they would be vested with the same rights.    Asked by another LDP legislator Wataru Hiraizumi how Japan,  bound by its pacifist constitution, would respond to calls for  UN-led collective defense, Kakizawa said, "Chapter 7 of the UN  Charter stipulates that a special agreement be concluded before  a country decides to participate in military measures.    "Therefore it is not contradictory to participate in UN  operations on a scope the constitution allows for," Kakizawa  said, noting that Japan has accepted the whole of the UN Charter.    Chapter 7 stipulates that member countries in case of  breaches of peace and acts of aggression make available forces,  assistance and facilities "in accordance with a special  agreement or agreements."    Countries are subject to ratification "in accord with their  respective constitutional processes," the charter says.    In a related comment, Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said Japan  "must deepen the ongoing thorough discussion" before deciding on  its response if the UN forces are set up.</p>

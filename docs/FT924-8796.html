			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Survey of Sweden (7): Swedish model leaves stage - Wage bargaining SWEDEN'S world-famous system of centralised wage bargaining between the country's employers and trade unions died slowly in the 1980s as SAF (Arbetsgivareforeningen) the country's powerful employers' organisation, turned against it on the grounds that it was inflexible, unwieldy and inflationary. But no definitive, permanent alternative has so far emerged, writes Robert Taylor. This autumn SAF has mobilised its 45,000 corporate members in a united front against any attempt by the trade unions to press for a new centralised wage agreement for 1993 and beyond after the present arrangements end in April. Mr Ulf Laurin, SAF's combative president, wants to see no general pay rise for anybody next year but a continuation of the existing two-year national agreement achieved by a government-appointed mediation commission. However, he favours the removal of two days' paid holiday from all workers as part of September's all-party crisis package. In the longer run, he believes in an escape once and for all from the fixation with centralised pay bargaining and the encouragement of a multiplicity of different payment systems among companies. 'The Swedish Model is dead. I want to see a diversity of Swedish Models in wage determination,' he explains. Most employers are in no position to compensate their workers for the present severe squeeze on living standards, let alone provide them with an increase that would improve their wage packets. 'We are uniquely united this time,' says Mr Laurin. For once all of Sweden's employers - even those in the country's enormous public services sector - have agreed to hold a firm line over pay. He accepts some of the large export-oriented companies may want to reward their workers and he believes they need the flexibility to do so but he remains opposed to any return to the old Swedish wage bargaining system that - as he points out - ensured many workers secured three separate pay rises at different levels - national, industrial and company - with the inevitable emergence of severe wage drift. SAF is opposed in particular to any attempt by the trade unions to negotiate  -as they want - a special deal for the low paid. Nor are employers in the mood to endorse any wage bargaining that involves income redistribution. The days of egalitarian wage policies are over. Ideally, SAF would like to see pay negotiations in future as close to the individual worker as possible. The present economic crisis provides Sweden's employers with an opportunity to reform industrial relations as they want. Rising unemployment can be expected to weaken trade union resistance. But it is necessary to distinguish between employer rhetoric and reality over wage determination. Under Mr Laurin's leadership SAF has abandoned much of its corporatist behaviour. Its nominees no longer sit of right on public boards. The organisation does not believe it should help to run the country. It preaches robust free market values of decentralisation and individualism. But this is no clean break with the past. Old habits linger on and the severity of Sweden's economic troubles continue to shape employer attitudes. Two years ago, neither SAF nor the trade unions wanted the creation of a temporary national mediation commission to coax the two sides to agree on pay but they accepted it eventually and it turned out a great success. Wage pressures eased dramatically as a result of the commission with a fall in the level of increase in hourly earnings from 10 per cent in 1990 to 5.6 per cent a year later. Professor Hans de Geer , the author of a forthcoming book in English - The Rise and Fall of the Swedish Model (Carden Publications) - admits SAF found itself in a 'paradoxical stance' as a result of accepting the mediation commission. As he argues: 'In reality, if not formally, just as SAF decided in principle on a decentralised form of negotiations, formal wage formation was again being centralised.' This winter the LO - Sweden's once mighty blue-collar union federation  - is revising its whole attitude to wage bargaining. It recently admitted: 'Increased unemployment and a deregulated capital market have dramatically strengthened the power of employers in their relations with workers.' Some union leaders may talk of using pay bargaining as a way of compensating households for the coming squeeze on their living standards but few Swedes believe the mood among workers is ripe for militant action. The LO favours the creation of what it calls an Ecu wage norm at national level of around 5 per cent, arguing that a centralised approach is more cost-effective than any other. The National Institute of Economic Research estimated recently that hourly earnings will rise by only 3.5 per cent this year with further modest increases of 3 per cent in 1993 and 4 per cent in 1994. This will ensure a 1.9 per cent increase in real disposable income, followed by a 2.8 per cent drop next year and only 1 per cent growth in 1994. Compare this with the increase of hourly earnings in both 1989 and 1990 by an average 10 per cent and a real improvement in disposable incomes of 2 per cent and 3.1 per cent respectively. The cold climate for wage bargaining may help to reduce unit labour costs still further over the next two years but many employers in manufacturing are reforming their work organisations and they want to introduce forms of merit pay to reward and encourage their workers. As Mr Laurin emphasises, Swedish employers want to have the freedom to introduce more flexible payments systems. But in the end neither SAF nor the trade unions seem likely to achieve all they want. Sweden will not return to centralised, nationwide wage determination. Nor will it move to the unstable free-for- all known in Britain. Some co-ordination among employers and trade unions seems likely to remain, however decentralised pay determination may grow in future. Indeed, SAF will have to devise a strong and uniform employer front to ensure a more long-term flexible approach succeeds. Prof de Geer sees the possible emergence of a 'system of local negotiations based on a fundamental attitude of converging interests in the companies'. This will empower local trade union organisations and their employer equivalents. An obvious tension exists between the national macro-economic need for low or no pay rises and the wish by Swedish employers to link pay more closely to productivity. The greater application of market forces to public welfare services may help to break down the difference in bargaining between private and public sectors but the demand for equity and fairness remains strong. The outlines of Sweden's next pay system have yet to be agreed. In the meantime, all sides face the gloomy prospect of wage-cutting unless the economy revives.</p>

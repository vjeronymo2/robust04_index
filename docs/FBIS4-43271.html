			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has said that Serge Abou,  whom the European Union [EU] assigned to be its Cyprus observer,  has adopted a one-sided attitude and is making utterly pro-Greek  Cypriot statements.    After his meeting with Gustave Feissel today, President  Denktas commented on the statement by Abou in connection with  the implementation of the confidence-building measures. Denktas  said that it is unacceptable that Abou, an observer, should be a  party to the issue or that he should try to mislead the EU.  Denktas said that the latest statement by Abou shows how  justified the Turkish Cypriots were in refusing to meet with  him. Denktas said: Influenced by the Greek Cypriots, Abou is  becoming a party to the issue and trying to influence the EU in  favor of the Greek Cypriots. This is a regrettable development.  In fact, it was a mistake to appoint this person.    Denktas concluded by saying that Abou was appointed probably  as a reinforcement to the Greek-Cypriot side.</p>

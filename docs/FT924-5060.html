			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / International Company News: Suez breaks off talks with UAP SUEZ, one of France's most prominent holding companies, has broken off its long-running negotiations with Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the largest state-controlled French insurer, over the latter's plan to invest in Suez's German insurance interests. The Suez board decided at a meeting late last week to suspend negotiations. It has for more than two years been locked in intricate discussions with UAP, which hoped to swap its minority holding in Victoire, a French insurer controlled by Suez, for part of Victoire's stake in Colonia, a large German insurance company. The break-off in negotiations is highly sensitive given that UAP is a significant minority shareholder in Suez, with 6.5 per cent of the equity and 10.5 per cent of the voting shares. It also highlights the tension between Mr Jean Peyrelevade, UAP's chairman, and his successor as chairman of Suez, Mr Gerard Worms. UAP was anxious to use Colonia as a base from which to expand into German, the biggest single European insurance market. Assurances Generales de France (AGF), one of its closest competitors, recently sealed its investment in AMB, another German insurer. Mr Peyrelevade, who has played an active role in the negotiations, hoped to take a 50 per cent share in Colonia in return for all or part of UAP's Victoire shares. But UAP was in a relatively weak negotiating position given that its only bargaining ploy was a minority stake and Suez already had clear control of Victoire. As a result, the two companies argued over price. Mr Peyrelevade was reluctant to compromise after his involvement with Suez. Meanwhile, as Mr Worms is well aware, the French financial community has seen the Colonia affair as an important test of his influence over Suez and of his independence from his old boss. The Suez board decided at last week's meeting that the gap between the two sides was 'too wide' for them to reach agreement. The board was unanimous in its decision to suspend discussions with UAP, which did not send its representative to the meeting.</p>

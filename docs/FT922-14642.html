			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / How To Spend It: Why lean times stretch ahead - Lucia van der Post has been delving in the depths of her wardrobe for skirts which fit the latest fashion diktat I KNOW, I KNOW . . . you have just got a nice little collection of sexy, snappy suits together. There they are, in different colours, the sassy, curvy jacket, the short Lycra skirt, the wardrobe of toning tights, the flat pumps. You feel good in them, you look good in them. And what does Paris do? It produces one of the strongest most directional collection of shows for years. The message it sends loud and clear is that the silhouette has changed. Short and sassy is for yesteryear. Long, narrow, simple and strict is what the new look is all about. Sometimes Paris speaks and nobody takes a blind bit of notice. This time Paris has spoken and the fashion set has listened. Two weeks ago, it seems, came the big divide. Sharply-turned-out women left their offices on Friday evening in their tights or leggings, their short skirts and their little jackets. By Monday half of them were toffed out in long narrow skirts, shops were pushing their short skirts to the back rails and highlighting their windows with the longer, leaner silhouette. In Paris these things are, of course, matters of deep import. It is not enough to wear the things, they have to be discussed, VERY SERIOUSLY, as well. Pundits on television have been heard muttering: 'Le mini c'est termine' or 'une chose c'est certaine, le mini est absolument abandonne'. The news need not be as depressing as it sounds. Anybody who has any nous knows by now that you do not throw out all your old clothes when fashions change. You get them cleaned and you pack them neatly away for when the pendulum swings back. Most of us have in our wardrobes several long skirts from last time around so stifle any inclination to rush and buy until you check out the clothes you have. Possibly your first buy should be a long jacket or narrow sleeveless waistcoat to team with an existing skirt, because the silhouette does require a longer, leaner top than the sassy jacket. Almost all the snappy chain-stores have them - I have seen inexpensive versions in Hennes, Oasis, Next and Warehouse while they come beautifully cut, very classy and more expensive from Whistles and MaxMara. Lucille Lewin, whose sharp eye and intuition for the way the fashion wind is blowing is behind the Whistles chain of shops, thinks the arrival of the long skirt is one of the best things to have happened to fashion in a long time. She says: 'We're very excited about the long skirt. It has completely resuscitated the fashion business. We've been selling them since just before Christmas and customers seem to love the new look. 'The skirts can be worn lots of ways - with a knotted shirt at the front, with a body or a lean, long-line waistcoat or jacket or with the soft, floaty little shorts underneath that are a very strong look this spring. The long skirts can either be sarong-style or 1950s-style buttoned-up the front (for a lady-like, feminine but sexy look, leave a couple of buttons at the bottom undone).' It also, I am afraid, means different shoes - either high heels or mini-boots or the coming fashion for - yes, I'm sorry, but it's true - platform soles. In fashion and PR offices up and down the country the young are more excited about long skirts than they have been about anything for a long time. They are either rushing to buy the inexpensive versions that are already beginning to arrive in chains like Oasis (a good sarong-style for Pounds 21.50), Next (a particularly elegant side-buttoning version in corn-coloured linen for Pounds 44.99) and Miss Selfridge or else the prudent ones, who never throw anything away, are digging out their long skirts from several years back. New in the shops though are long slender dresses (like the one from Whistles sketched here) and the very soft shorts, almost like French knickers. For those who do not fancy wearing long skirts - they are undoubtedly less practical and harder to rush around in than the short skirt has been - trousers are the obvious alternative and were in ample evidence at all the Paris shows. If you are at all worried as to how the new proportions will suit you find a really good assistant in a shop you trust (the Whistles branch at 12 St Christopher's Place, London W1 has some particularly good ones). Take your time and experiment. You will find that there is always a way of adapting a current look to suit almost any shape and size. In the meantime do not throw away your short skirts. Take a leaf out of Lucille Lewin's notebook. 'It's not the time to be throwing anything away. I still wear my short skirts sometimes, I just wear them in a much more graphic way, teaming them with long sweaters so that just a little bit of skirt peeps out from underneath.'</p>

			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / Change of role for French fast breeder France's Superphenix, built as the world's largest fast breeder reactor to produce electricity, is to start a new life in the next few days as a centre of research into the burning of plutonium and nuclear waste. The French nuclear safety authority yesterday gave the final go-ahead for the 1,300MW reactor to end its four-year shutdown, and the director of Superphenix at Creys-Malville, south of Lyon, said he hoped to be able to push the start button before Sunday. Running Superphenix as a research reactor will cost FFr100m (Pounds 12m) a year, to be borne by France's Atomic Energy Commission and Electricite de France (EdF), the French utility that owns 51 per cent of the reactor. Half the money will be spent on a study into the burning of plutonium. The restarting of Superphenix, primarily as an incinerator of plutonium and unrecyclable waste and only incidentally as a power generator, comes as Cogema, France's nuclear fuels agency, is trying hard to maintain important German reprocessing contracts. Last week Greenpeace, the environmental action group, published a resume of discussions between Cogema and Preussenelectkra (PE), a subsidiary of Veba, in which the latter said it wanted to make some changes to its 1990 contract with Cogema in an effort to limit its plutonium stocks. Originally conceived in the fuel-short 1970s, Superphenix was designed to 'breed' more plutonium than it consumes. But it is now to be switched to destroy more than it creates. Mr Jean-Louis Ricaud, Cogema's head of reprocessing, said yesterday that Superphenix's net consumption of 100kg of plutonium a year would be useful, but only marginally in the context of the 10 tonnes of plutonium which French reactors produce each year. But Mr Ricaud said Cogema's contract renegotiation with PE began well before a recent legal change in Germany, dropping the previous requirement for German utilities to reprocess their spent nuclear fuel, and giving them the option of stocking it. Mr Ricaud said he was confident of keeping his German clients, who account for 15 per cent of Cogema's FFr14bn a year reprocessing business, and who have helped fund the FFr30bn spent on the fuel recycling plant that Cogema has built for its foreign clients at La Hague in Normandy. The change in Germany is the result of a compromise thrashed out between Mr Klaus Topher, environment minister, and the opposition Social Democrats, to end a dispute which has frozen development of nuclear energy in Germany since the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. The German utilities will have to decide whether to continue current contracts with Cogema and British Nuclear Fuels or to seek an alternative site for direct disposal to the Gorleben salt mines in Lower Saxony. Gorleben, which is being financed by the utilities is not yet in use, and commissioning is running behind schedule because of political obstacles.</p>

			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / Nalgo backs pay offer NALGO, the largest union for local-authority white-collar workers, yesterday 'agreed reluctantly' to a pay offer that will increase local authorities' pay bill by 4.1 per cent. Delegates at a conference in London voted 3-1 to accept the offer, which is weighted to favour the lowest-paid, who would gain rises of 4.4 per cent. Those at the top end of the scale would receive 4 per cent.</p>

			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei rises on economic package Nikkei average gained 2.4 per cent, rising briefly above the 18,000 level, in anticipation of the government's economic stimulus package, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average closed up 415.79 at 17,970.79, a rise of 9.7 per cent on the week. In the morning session, the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, vice-president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party pushed the Nikkei to the day's low of 17,241.77. However, reports that the LDP would propose a economic stimulus package of over Y10,000bn, boosted buying, and the index hit the day's high of 18,168.81. Volume surged from 620m to 850m shares, the highest level since September 1991, with most of the activity coming after the LDP's proposals were unveiled. Gainers outnumbered losers by 977 to 98, with 49 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 39.52 to 1,379.97 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 14.49 to 1,104.23. Investors were also encouraged by reports that the government's economic support measures would include expanding the amount of investment permitted in the stock market. Hopes that new money totalling some Y1,000bn could be used for equity investments added to the positive sentiment. Dealers traded heavily in speculative, theme-related stocks. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, surged Y190 to Y1,580, and Ube Industries added Y2 to Y445. Real estate companies were also firm with Mitsui Fudosan up Y60 to Y1,110 and Mitsubishi Estate gaining Y30 to Y1,030. Brokers were strong on hopes that the recent rise in activity would help an earnings recovery. Nomura Securities advanced Y60 to Y1,550 and Daiwa Securities gained Y77 to Y932. Some blue chips which had risen on short-covering and bargain-hunting, lost ground, with Sony falling Y90 to Y4,200 and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone down Y2,000 to Y626,000. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 683.71 to 19,829.05 in volume of 39.3m shares. Roundup MANILA's negative performance stood out in an otherwise strong region yesterday. HONG KONG finished sharply higher on a technical rebound which sent the Hang Seng Index up 167.88 or 3.1 per cent to 5,628.60, for a rise of 2.2 per cent on the week. Turnover rose to HKDollars 2.72bn from HKDollars 2.36bn. Rumours that Hongkong Macau (Holdings) would sell Nine Queen's Road Central, a luxury retail block, lifted the share by 50 cents to HKDollars 11.50. TAIWAN reversed early falls to close higher on bargain-hunting, triggered partly by an unexpected rise in China Steel. The weighted index ended 51.48 or 1.4 per cent higher at the day's high of 3,852.45, down 0.4 per cent on the week. Turnover was thin at TDollars 18.63bn after TDollars 19.38bn. China Steel closed limit up at TDollars 17.70 on active buying: August 29 is the first date on which foreigners can redeem the company's GDRs. AUSTRALIA was helped by a strong performance from News Corp which put on 90 cents to ADollars 23.90. The All Ordinaries index gained 10.6 to 1553.9, in turnover of ADollars 324m, but was marginally lower on the week. MANILA's fall continued on worries over the strength of the local currency against the dollar. The composite index shed 39.54 to 1,386.77, giving a drop of almost 6 per cent on the week. Combined turnover fell to 275m from 370m. Among actives, PNB fell 2.50 pesos to 270 pesos. NEW ZEALAND's NZSE-40 index advanced 2.22 to 1,480.56, steady on the week. Carter Holt Harvey rose 5 cents to NZDollars 2.60 on news that a government-backed joint venture of Maori interests would bid for CHH's fishing business. Fletcher Challenge lost 8 cents to NZDollars 2.36.</p>

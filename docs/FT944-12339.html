			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / IoD warns of fall in confidence The Institute of Directors said yesterday it saw no evidence of overheating in the economy to justify a further increase in interest rates. In its bi-monthly business opinion survey of company directors, the IoD found that confidence in the economy and bullishness about future prospects had fallen in October compared with August. Directors also expressed concern about lack of demand and were worried about meeting customer demands and cashflow. The survey of 300 of the institute's 33,000 members revealed that in spite of a dampened feel-good factor, 78 per cent said their company was performing very well or fairly well overall, slightly up from the 76 per cent who expressed that opinion in August. Company performance remained healthy as orders and volumes were buoyant in October. Those reporting an increase in business volume over the last six months steadied at 63 per cent and reports of increased orders rose from 49 per cent in August to 53 per cent in October. However, those reporting an increased profits trend slipped from 54 per cent in August to 51 per cent last month. Investment and employment prospects were still strong, if slightly down from the previous survey. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, Iod director general, said: 'We are still enjoying steady, positive growth but there is now evidence that the rate of growth was slowing even before September's (interest rate) increase. 'Bearing in mind that other indicators such as growth in earnings and broad money supply remain low and the housing market is flat, there is no evidence to support another interest rate rise at this stage.'</p>

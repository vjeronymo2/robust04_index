			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Lang in running for party chairmanship Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, has emerged as a contender for the chairmanship of the Tory party in the planned cabinet reshuffle after the European elections. But some senior ministers are still pressing Mr John Major to appoint Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Mr Heseltine has made clear he does not want to move from his present position, but might find it hard to resist a direct request from the prime minister without damaging his own leadership ambitions. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, is another strong contender, and Mrs Gillian Shepherd, the agriculture minister, also remains in the running. Mr Hunt's strong campaigning skills count in his favour, but his determinedly pro-European views antagonise the sceptical right of the party. Mrs Shepherd, like Mr Lang, is regarded as one of the strongest personal supporters of the prime minister in the cabinet. The new chairman will have a pivotal role in trying to restore the party's battered morale after the European elections and in supporting Mr Major's own leadership during what is expected to be a perilous few months. Mr Lang's credentials are being promoted by friends of the prime minister in spite of the difficulties Mr Major would face in replacing him at the Scottish Office. There is no obvious successor to Mr Lang among the party's Scottish MPs, and the appointment of a minister from an English constituency might further damage the government's precarious standing in Scotland. Mr Major is said to have been impressed by Mr Lang's performance in Scotland, where he has succeeded in slowing if not reversing the haemorrhaging of support for the Tories. Mr Major is said to have complete trust in the Scottish secretary, a prerequisite for an effective relationship in the run-up to a general election.</p>

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Letter: Gatt can only survive if it widens its remit to include social clause Sir, David Buchan writes that the idea of a social clause in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is 'presumably that unions would push up labour standards, and thus costs, in developing countries'. ('France's four-letter word', June 21). The idea is far simpler. It is that unions, once able to operate in conformity with the conventions agreed by governments, employers and unions over decades at International Labour Organisation tripartite gatherings, would be able to push up internal purchasing power, hence demand. It is a system that worked first for North America, then for west Europe, and then for Japan between 1945 and 1980, and follows the law of subsidiarity, as it allowed institutions of different countries to find their own way to solve the problem of wealth creation and distribution. High internal demand supported by high wages usually goes hand in hand with low unit costs, and free trade. A Gatt social clause was not needed for the US, Japan and west Europe, as all three economic centres played by the rules of economic and democratic pluralism - including the former authoritarian states of Spain, Portugal and Greece when they joined the EC. Unfortunately, the new world economic players, notably those in Asia, want to write new rules to guarantee their positions as export platforms while denying economic pluralism internally. Gatt will only survive if it widens its remit to include a social clause, and the EC leaders in Copenhagen should ask not how they can make European worker-consumers poorer by cutting labour costs but how they can make the world's worker-consumers richer by increasing their ability to buy the goods and services they make.

			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / Letter: No benign feelings in the present recession Sir, When, a decade ago, the recession, which particularly hit the building industry, brought us to our knees, we had no feeling of resentment against the government. We recognised that draconian measures were necessary to curb inflation and to alter radically the habits of many years of socialism and quasi-socialism. It nevertheless took us six years to recover from the destruction of our infrastructure brought about by that recession. This time round, we have no such benign feelings towards the government. We regard the recession as being the result of unforgivable incompetence by the government. We have listened with anger to government spokesmen calling for investment by industry in innovation. What industry is suffering from now is lack of liquidity resulting from its having made plans for innovation and expansion when interest rates were in the 7-10 per cent band. Even those rates were high, but, in the belief then that government could maintain a reasonable degree of economic stability, the plans were perfectly prudent. It is not just that by doubling interest rates the cost of borrowing was doubled, and, more importantly, that even one's most pessimistic sales forecasts were undermined. What gives us cause for anger is that the government was clearly unaware of what it was doing and the effect it would have. Even as late as after Christmas the prime minister was telling us that there was no recession. When finally he conceded that it existed, it was described as being 'shallow and short-lived'. How can industry be expected to plan in the light of such lack of understanding by government of what constitutes a workable economic framework? The Conservatives would now have us believe that, having re-vamped local government taxation, they are set fair to win another election. I can only say that I feel disenfranchised. I want no repeat of the socialist experience, but have lost faith in the government. Indeed, I feel now as I did when Mr Heath was in power - the Conservatives need a term in opposition, during which they can do some re-thinking.

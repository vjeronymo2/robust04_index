			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUGS NOT MAIN CAUSE FOR GANGS, SHERIFF SAYS;  </P> <P> CRIME: BLOCK SAYS IT'S A MISCONCEPTION THAT NARCOTICS SALES ARE THE BIGGEST  REASON FOR STREET VIOLENCE. HE TELLS OF NEED TO FOCUS ON SELF-WORTH AND  SELF-ESTEEM.  </P> <P> The misconception that the drug trade is the chief motivator for gang violence  has hobbled efforts to solve an expanding problem that is killing more people  across Los Angeles County every year, Sheriff Sherman Block told a gathering of  600 educators in Downey on Wednesday.  </P> <P> The acknowledgment, echoed by numerous gang authorities at a gang symposium  sponsored by the county Office of Education, represents a public departure from  statements made by some law enforcement officials and politicians since Los  Angeles' gang problems became a national story two years ago.  </P> <P> "The cause for the majority of the violence is pure and simple: fascination and  excitement, coupled with deep-seated hatred of one gang for another," Block  said.  </P> <P> Although drug sales often constitute the means by which street thugs finance  vehicles and sophisticated weaponry, Block said, "the time has come for the  newly enlightened in our community to start looking at the gang situation  realistically.  </P> <P> "To effectively compete with gangs for the hearts, minds and bodies of  potential gang members," Block said, "we must focus on enhancing their  self-worth and self-esteem so that they do not seek out and need the gang to  satisfy these most basic human needs."  </P> <P> It is an attitude somewhat at variance with thinking among some law enforcement  officials and politicians.  </P> <P> As the spread of crack cocaine has ravaged neighborhood after neighborhood,  police have routinely blamed most gang problems on drugs. Leading the assault  against the so-called "gang-drug tie-in" has been Los Angeles Police Chief  Daryl F. Gates, who once said local gangs had turned into "significant  organized crime units" perfectly structured to be drug distribution networks.  </P> <P> This theory, widely repeated in local and national news reports, holds that  drive-by shootings and other attacks grew out of competition between street  gangs for drug-selling turf or new markets.  </P> <P> However, "the general impression put forth by the media today that gangs are  fighting each other primarily over drug dealing turf is really an  oversimplification of the problem," Block said. "Street gangs are really mortal  enemies and will not hesitate to kill each other on sight whether drugs are an  issue or not."  </P> <P> County Juvenile Court Judge Jaime Corral agreed, saying, "It is too easy to say  that drugs are fostering this gang violence. . . . It's a cop-out."  </P> <P> "Gangs were here long before drugs," added Sheriff's Capt. Raymond Gott, who  attended the symposium, "and if we excluded the drug problem today, the hatred  of one gang for another would still be there."  </P> <P> Many gang members and community-based organizations have long derided the  notion that gang violence is directly related to the drug trade. In fact, they  said, the two problems, while connected, were often separate.  </P> <P> Much of the gang killing, they said, grew out of longtime rivalries shaped by  the simple intrusion of one gang member into another's territory. An endless  cycle of "payback" attacks, motivated by nothing more than revenge, ensued.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, dozens of gangs composed primarily of older members who cared more  about money than turf rivalries took their entrepreneurial skills and access to  rock cocaine across the country. Los Angeles gang members showing up in cities  from Seattle to Boston seemed to suggest that Los Angeles-based gangs were  highly organized, almost "Mafia-like" drug dealing operations, gang authorities  said.  </P> <P> Gates could not be reached for comment. But Police Cmdr. William Booth insisted  that "drugs in our view are a major factor" in gang violence.  </P> <P> Police figures show that 55% of homicides are drug-related, "directly or  indirectly," said Booth, and 38% of homicides are gang-related. "We think there  is crossover there."  </P> <P> Steve Valdivia, executive director of Community Youth Gang Services, however,  argued, "The simple answer is to say these people use drugs."  </P> <P> "Gangs are everywhere now, but they started in areas of high unemployment and  welfare, poor schools and deteriorating neighborhoods," Valdivia said. "Add to  that a government that did not address those issues, a government that saw it  as a minority problem and not 'our problem,' meaning a white problem."  </P></p>

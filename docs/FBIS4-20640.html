			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First paragraph comment by NASDA REPORT] </F>   [Text] Experiment Missions Defined; System Experiment  Completed and Compatibility Between EFFU and Core System  Verified: The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) is being developed  jointly by the National Space Development Agency of Japan  (NASDA), the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science  (ISAS), and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development  Organization (NEDO).    The Space Flyer Unit (SFU) core system is being developed by  ISAS in cooperation with NEDO. NASDA is responsible for  launching SFU by the H-II launch vehicle, supporting SFU  tracking and control operation by ISAS, and developing SFU-borne  Exposed Facility Flyer Unit (EFFU) which is the NASDA experiment  mission.    The SFU is scheduled to be launched with the Geostationary  Meteorological Satellite-5 (GMS-5) in the season of  January-February 1995 by the H-II Launch Vehicle Flight No. 3  from Tanegashima Space Center. It will be retrieved by the NASA  Space Shuttle in the summer of 1995 after operating for six  months on-orbit.    NASDA selected as its SFU experiment mission the validation  experiment of the component model of the "Exposed Facility" for  the Japanese Experiment Module (JEM) for the international Space  Station "Freedom" and the "Vapor-Phase Growth Fundamental  Experiment," a common experiment. They were developed and  assembled into the EFFU as shown in Fig. 1.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-015L-28A>      Fig. 1 Structure of EFFU </FIG>     The main purposes of validating the component model of the  exposed facility are to verify the operation of the separation  and connection mechanism used for replacing experiment equipment  in space, to establish an active thermal control system with  fluid heat transfer loop, to establish microgravity measuring  technology in microgravity conditions, and to evaluate the  characteristics of the materials exposed to space environments.    Homogeneity of plasma generation in microgravity is observed  and the diamond substrate growth in the plasma environments is  verified using the Gas Dynamics Experiment Facility (GDEF) to  conduct the Vapor-Phase Growth Fundamental Experiment.    The test of the EFFU itself was completed in the summer of  1992 and the EFFU was assembled into the SFU core body. The  one-year SFU system test was to verify the compatibility of the  EFFU with the SFU core system was completed.

As shown by the schedule in Fig. 2, EFFU will be brought  back to the manufacturing plant where the plasma generation  electrodes of GDEF will be replaced, reacting gases (hydrogen  and methane gases) will be reloaded, and the thermal shield  materials covering the exterior of EFFU will be checked. The  EFFU will be transported to Tanegashima Space Center in the  autumn of 1995 after completing the checkout and servicing. The  materials for the exposure experiment will be assembled into the  dedicated holder installed on the exterior of EFFU at  Tanegashima Space Center just prior to launch.</p>

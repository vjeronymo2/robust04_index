In the first area have been for the first time developed:  a) a method of extruding single-mode fibers with sheaths made of  fluorine-doped quartz glass for 1.3-1.55 m infrared light  b) a new technology for producing anisotropic single-mode fibers  which maintain the polarization and the intensity of light with  minimal losses  c) a laboratory technology for producing single-mode fibers  which transmit 1.3 m light with an only 0.7 dB/km maximum  loss  d) a method of welding together different fibers with an only  0.5 dB loss per joint. In addition to improvement of the  extruding apparatus, there have been developed a plasmochemical  variant of vertical lateral deposition for glass-forming oxides  with use of organometallic compounds as initial reactants, a  method of producing large-aperture fibers, a method of producing  low-loss multimode fibers. A new method of forming anisotropic  ``bow tie'' fibers, with the aid of thermal shields, has been  proposed and demonstrated. A high magnetic susceptibility of  single-mode fibers has been attained by use of using rare-earth  elements as dopants. For the first time has been developed a  tubeless method of lateral deposition of thin fluorosilicate  sheaths on quartz rods in a microwave plasma. Jointly with the  Institute of Optical Physics and the Scientific Research  Institute of Electrical Systems at the Ministry of Electrical  Industry have been produced radiation-resistant power fibers,  radiation-resistant and mechanically strong single-mode and  multimode fibers, thick fiber strands for optical cables, and  large-aperture low-loss fibers doped with various rare-earth  elements as well as large-aperture quartz-quartz fibers for  transmitting up to 500 W of laser radiation power with 80%  efficiency. Other developments include deposition of polymer  sheaths, new silicon elastomers for fiber coatings which will  ensure at least 99% transmission, and a cryogenic  microcable  for temperatures from 80C down to -60C. Theoretical  studies have yielded a theory of microflexure and a new model of  hydrolytic fracture of quartz fibers. New apparatus with  fiber-optic components for measuring physical quantities and  methods of doing it have also been developed, the components  including fiber thermooptic channel switches, Fourier analyzers,  a random-access memory, polarizers, light modulators, two-mode  reflectometers, directional couplers, temperature and magnetic  field transducers. Work has furthermore been done on several  practical applications of fiber-optic technology. In the area of  laser materials and devices there have been developed a method  of hardening phosphate glass, a new Cr-Y-Er glass for  heat-resistant minilasers and high-efficiency low- threshold  quatrons, a 1.5 m Er-minilaser suitable for a record high 7  Hz pulse repetition rate, borate glass activated with Yb and Er.  There also have for the first time been achieved parametric  resonance emission of ultraviolet picosecond pulses and  continuous high-efficiency emission by Nd ions. Other new  developments include powder lasers (Nd-ion implanted in powders  of La oxide or oxysulfide, binary Na, La, Ba, or Gd chromate-  molybdate, La-Sr niobate, and Ga-Yb sulfide with Nd impurity), a  new kind of mirrors using resonant metal screens for optically  pumped lasers, a highly long-time stable  CO[.sub]2[/]-OsO[.sub]4[/], and diffusely reflecting  coatings (aluminum, fused quartz, phosphate glass) for laser  reflectors, also a new method of hardening phosphate glass for  active media and a new method of welding together glasses  containing chromium. The feasibility of producing fibers for  high-efficiency transmission of infrared light has been proposed  on the basis of theoretical analysis and then demonstrated  experimentally on fibers transmitting 1.5 m at an average  power of 2 W with an up to 30 % efficiency. With  low-energy  ultraviolet lasers, efficient frequency conversion by stimulated  Raman scattering has been achieved in a multipass vessel  containing methane under a pressure of 30 atm. Research was done  on both electron-magnetic resonance and nuclear- magnetic  resonance spectroscopy, studies of the latter having revealed a  ``cascade'' narrowing of the NMR spectra owing to concurrent  action of a strong radio-frequency field and slow molecular  movements in solids. As to generators of electromagnetic  signals, there have been developed microminiature microwave  vacuum devices including solid-state oscillators such as  transistors, avalanche diodes, and Gunn-effect diodes. More than  80 scientific articles have been published during that period.</p>

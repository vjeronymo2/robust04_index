			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / International Company News: Nikkei derivatives for Simex The Singapore International Monetary Exchange has become the first non-Japanese futures exchange to be given the licensing rights to trade futures and options contracts based on the newly-created Nikkei 300 Japanese stock index. The rights were granted by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the Japanese newspaper, The capitalisation-weighted Nikkei 300 is expected to supplant the widely-followed Nikkei 225 as the benchmark index of the Japanese stock market, and the futures licensing agreement gives Simex the opportunity to continue its lead in Asian stock index futures derivatives. The Simex intends to trade Nikkei 300 derivatives in direct competition with the Osaka futures exchange, which already holds rights to the same index. The Singapore exchange has not announced a launch date for the new Nikkei products, but says it will trade its Nikkei 300 and Nikkei 225 stock index products side by side. In January and February there were more than 1.3m Nikkei 225 futures and options contracts traded on Simex, substantially more than similar contracts in Osaka or on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Separately, the Simex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange have agreed to extend their mutual offset arrangement for five years. The arrangement, instrumental in Simex's creation in 1984, allows trades made at either exchange to be offset on the other's trading floor. It was implemented to give the CME a presence in the Asian time zone, and has continued despite the invention of Globex, an international after-hours futures trading system.</p>

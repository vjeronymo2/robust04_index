			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Mustafa Mashhur] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Muslims in some of our Arab  and Islamic countries have been afflicted with tyrannical  regimes that control the people's fate in varying degrees. Some  regimes permit relative, limited, freedom, others ban political  parties, and others place restrictions and obstacles in the way  of parties getting permission to operate. They allow parties  that have no popular base and don't allow those that have a  large popular base so that they can say they are applying  democracy and allowing a multitude of parties. Some regimes  interfere with legislative elections in favor of the ruling  party. Some regimes might also appoint legislative councils.  Some regimes control the official media--radio, television,  newspapers, and magazines--and spend the people's money on them  so that they will serve as their instruments. They draft laws  restricting the freedom to publish newspapers. They also draft  emergency laws restricting public freedom and prompting youths  to go underground and violate the law. Such activity is met  with counterviolence, which does not help solve the problem; it  escalates it. We see this clearly in Algeria and Egypt.  Indiscriminate arrests also help to increase the number of  rebels and the bloodshed on both sides.    Such cases of instability prevent an atmosphere of security  for achieving reform and development from being established.  They also provide the opportunity to outside forces to carry  out activities and attribute them to citizens, because the  continuing instability serves the interest of these foreign  forces.    Our advice to such regimes--if they are sincere in seeking  their countries' good--is to free up public liberties, such as  the freedom to form parties, the freedom of the press, and the  freedom to hold conferences and symposiums. These regimes must  ensure the honesty of elections so that a government  representing the majority of the people can be formed and the  freely elected state institutions can carry out their  responsibilities and duties to achieve a good and honorable life  for their peoples and solve every problem and crisis. Free  elections separate the good from the bad.    Much argument has raged about the dialogue, its motives, who  should participate in it, the issues it should deal with, the  issues that should take priority, and the conclusion that should  be reached. Much doubt has been cast on the seriousness of the  dialogue. The situation in society is worsening, reaching a  point where it is almost intolerable. A solution must be found.  There are many political, economic, security, and foreign  problems and they must not remain unsolved. The ruling regime  was supposed to solve them, but it couldn't, because it has lost  the people's confidence. If the dialogue is meant to involve  the people in finding sound solutions to these problems, the  correct and natural approach is to give the people their freedom  and political rights first, such as the freedom to form parties,  freedom of the press, and free and honest elections of  legislative assemblies that can fulfill their responsibilities  in solving these problems.    But if the dialogue's purpose is for the participants to  come  out with something like a charter that will bind the people,  this is wrong, because the interlocutors are not elected by the  people in free and honest elections that would have the people  abide by what is achieved.    The Muslim Brotherhood wholeheartedly wishes that stability  and reform might be achieved in all state sectors and that all  problems will be solved concretely. We hope the time will come  when everyone will be convinced that Islam is the solution,  because it is characterized by perfection, as it comes from God,  who is perfect. God's word is the truth and he guides us on our  way.</p>

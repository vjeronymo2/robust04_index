			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Zaire bank governor defies suspension Zaire's central bank governor Ndiang Kaboul ignored his suspension and turned up for work as usual yesterday in defiance of prime minister Kengo Wa Dondo, Reuter reports from Kinshasa. Colleagues applauded Mr Ndiang, who was suspended on Friday pending an audit of recent bank transactions, as he arrived at his office in the Bank of Zaire. But a board meeting to discuss the crisis at the bank was chaired by the man appointed as his temporary replacement, deputy governor Matomina Kiala, bank officials said. Mr Kengo's government has accused Mr Ndiang, in the job since February, of flooding Zaire's black market with millions of newly printed zaire notes, sending the national currency into a disastrous downward spiral and triggering hyper-inflation. They say the governor, appointed by President Mobutu Sese Seko, ordered notes to be printed for friends, influential politicians and army generals. In an interview with an opposition newspaper, Mr Ndiang angrily denied the charges. He challenged the legality of his suspension and said he had asked President Mobutu to rule in the matter. 'A governor of the central bank, appointed by presidential command, who enjoys a certain autonomy and prestige thanks to the importance of the institution, cannot be suspended or fired any old way,' he told the newspaper Le Potentiel. 'I am ready to show all the accounts and outgoings for the bank from the start of my mandate until the present day. I demand that justice be done,' he added. He said he was launching legal proceedings against finance minister Pay Pay Wa Syakassighe, who compiled a damning report on the Bank of Zaire's activities, for abuse of position, denigration of character and drawing up a false report. The currency, the zaire, a reliable barometer of public sentiment, firmed to 1,050 to the US dollar from 1,400 before the governor's suspension.</p>

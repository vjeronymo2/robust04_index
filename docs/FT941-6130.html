			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Power contracts deadline tonight Businesses must sign contracts with power companies by tonight if they are to take advantage from April 1 of the liberalisation of the electricity market. Under de-regulation measures, about 45,000 businesses using between 100kw and 1MW of electricity will be able to choose from a number of companies for their power, instead of just the local regional electricity distributor.</p>

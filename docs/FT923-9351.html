			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Japan surplus climbs 94% in first half JAPAN'S current account surplus for the first half of the year rose 94 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 56.2bn (Pounds 29.4bn), a record for any six-month period. The Ministry of Finance said the surplus for June was 43.5 per cent higher at Dollars 9.4bn, due mostly to a rapidly growing trade surplus, which was Dollars 11.4bn for the month against Dollars 9.3bn in the same month last year. While the ministry said the surge in the current account surplus was a temporary result of yen appreciation, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry voiced concern that some troubled Japanese companies appeared to have increased exports sharply. During the first half there was a jump in exports of chemical products, construction materials, cars and electronic devices, as companies attempted to reduce domestic inventories that have built up as the economy has slowed. Meanwhile, demand for imports has declined. Part of the large year-on-year increase in the current account surplus was due to the transfer early last year of a Dollars 9bn contribution to the Gulf war effort, but the Japanese government is slowly accepting that the turnround in the domestic economy is the main cause of the consistently large surpluses this year. The Finance Ministry said the seasonally adjusted surplus for June was Dollars 8.4bn, down from Dollars 10.9bn in May. However, preliminary trade statistics for July suggest the trade and current account surpluses will top Dollars 10bn again for the month. Japan's current account surplus had fallen from Dollars 87bn in 1987 to Dollars 35.8bn in 1990, leading the government to believe that trade friction would also be reduced. But the surplus jumped to Dollars 72.9bn last year and is on course to exceed Dollars 100bn this year. Balance of payments details showed net Japanese purchases of foreign securities at Dollars 4.8bn in June, against Dollars 3.3bn in May, while foreigners' net sales of Japanese securities were Dollars 2.3bn, compared with net purchases of Dollars 75m in May. For the six months, the long-term capital account showed a net inflow of Dollars 650m, down 82 per cent from the same period last year, mainly due to a slowing of foreign purchases of Japanese stocks. In May, foreigners' net purchases of stocks were Dollars 837m, although net sales in June were Dollars 1.95bn, as the Tokyo market continued to fall. The basic balance of payments in the first six months had a surplus of Dollars 56.8bn, against Dollars 32.5bn in the same period last year, while the overall balance showed a surplus of Dollars 58.8bn, up sharply from Dollars 7.5bn last year. Japan's trade mix has not remained the same and instead of exporting whole products, new factories abroad are consuming Japanese components. East Asia has replaced North America as Japan's most important market. Last week, talks between the US and Japan focused on the trade surplus and structural impediments to trade. After the two-day meeting, US negotiators, under orders from Washington, were determined to portray the Structural Impediments Initiative (SII) agreement as successful in treating the underlying causes of Japan's consistently large trade surplus.</p>

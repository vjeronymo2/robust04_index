			<p><P> August 5, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MOBIL AMENDS BALLOT FINANCIAL REPORT  </P> <P> Mobil Oil Corp. has filed an amended financial report for the campaign  committee that helped defeat a March ballot measure aimed at banning the use of  hydrofluoric acid at the company's Torrance refinery.  </P> <P> The new report, received Thursday by the Torrance city clerk, corrected a  discrepancy in an earlier report that was caused by a mathematical error, said  Charles H. Bell Jr., a Sacramento attorney representing Mobil.  </P> <P> The report shows that the Mobil Oil Corp. Refinery Safety Committee/No on  Measure A collected a total of $710,238.78, all but $200 of it from Mobil. The  committee received $644,895.07 in monetary contributions from Mobil and  $65,343.71 in "non-monetary contributions," which Bell described as staff time  of Mobil employees.  </P> <P> The only contributors besides Mobil were David E. Novitski, a Mobil attorney  and the committee's treasurer, who gave $100, and attorney Ernest J. Getto, who  also gave $100, the report says.  </P> <P> The group spent $644,895.07, primarily on broadcast advertising, literature and  polling, the report states. It reports no cash on hand as of June 30, the end  of the reporting period.  </P> <P> The ballot measure lost 3-1 in the March 6 Torrance election.  </P></p>

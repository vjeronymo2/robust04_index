			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Prague takes leaf from EC tax book THE CZECHOSLOVAK federal parliament has adopted a series of new tax laws modelled on European Community practice which will broaden the tax base and put state finances on a sounder footing. A whole raft of new taxes - including value added tax, personal and company income taxes, real estate taxes, inheritance and gift taxes, and environment taxes - come into effect from January 1, 1993. They will replace the former communist system which relied heavily on 'profits taxes' levied on state-owned industry and turnover taxes which have proved increasingly difficult to collect. The tax bills presented by Mr Vaclav Klaus, federal finance minister, set the corporate income tax rate at 45 per cent and maximum personal income tax rate at 47 per cent. The federal parliament also recently approved a value-added tax of 23 per cent and a reduced, 5 per cent rate, on essential goods. The finance minister estimated the introduction of VAT would lead to a 7 per cent rise in prices next year while the general shift of the tax burden onto individuals and consumers will raise living costs substantially. Joint ventures involving foreign partners will fall under the new tax structure from January 1, 1993, unless they have negotiated the currently-available two-year tax holiday. Joint ventures without this tax holiday now pay 40 per cent corporate tax instead of the 55 per cent rate paid by local enterprises. The parliament also adopted a law regulating the private investment funds recently created to benefit from the country's privatisation programme. The law aims to protect citizens who have given their vouchers entitling them to shares of newly-privatised enterprises to such funds for management. It stipulates that funds must diversify their assets and cannot hold more than 20 per cent of any one company.</p>

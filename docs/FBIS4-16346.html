			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 13 Apr -- Ivan Yemets, chairman of the Central  Electoral Commission, held a news conference on the preliminary  official results of the parliamentary election in Ukraine.  According to Ivan Yemets, 338 people's deputies have been  elected to date, including 129 nominated by labor collectives,  120 by groups of electors, and 89 by parties. The following  parties won the following number of seats:    The Communist Party of Ukraine -- 86    Rukh -- 20    Peasant Party of Ukraine -- 18    Socialist Party of Ukraine -- 14    Ukrainian Republican Party - 8    Other parties won between one and five seats; 169 deputies  have no party affiliation. The newly elected deputies include  12 women and 56 deputies of the former parliament.    Asked about the course of the election campaign in  Artemovskiy constituency No 1 in Kiev, Ivan Yemets said there  had been no official complaints either from Rukh or official  observers. There had been mutual claims from the teams of both  candidates. He said that 19,126, or 45.04 percent, voted for  Kostyantyn Morozov and 19,532, or 45.99 percent, voted for  Viktor Medvedchuk.    Ivan Yemets gave explanations on certain points of the law  on  elections. He emphasized, in particular, that candidates who  lost the election could not be nominated in repeat elections.  Yemets believes Ukraine should introduce "positive voting" in  the future; that is, marking the chosen candidate on the ballot  paper rather than crossing out all those the elector is voting  against. He said: "Ukraine's election law needs the hand of a  lawyer. Unfortunately, the law was drafted by Anatoliy Tkachuk,  not a lawyer but an engineer."</p>

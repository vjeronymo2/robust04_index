			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Skosyrev and Konstantin Eggert: </F> "Foreign Ministers of Russia and China Establish Order on the  Border and Drive Out the Flies"]    [Text] Beijing -- Russia wants to raise relations with  China to the level of strategic partnership. That was announced  by Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev at a press conference  in Beijing.    Western journalists inquired about the military side of the  Russo-Chinese partnership, and even accused Kozyrev of hiding  the figures about deliveries of Russian armaments to China and  of not abiding by the principle of glasnost. The minister  assured journalists that glasnost is alive and well at the  Russian Foreign Ministry. Nevertheless, he did not cite any  specific facts in the sphere of military-technical cooperation.    The PRC leaders are in no hurry to take up the formula of  strategic partnership. The head of China's foreign policy  department prefers to speak in more cautious terms.    The Russian minister spoke about the agreement on border  crossing points and cited his conversation with PRC President  Jiang Zemin, who said: "When a door opens, people may enter but  flies may enter, too. We must ensure that there are fewer  flies." By flies the leader of the PRC evidently means any kind  of criminal element. The agreement signed recently in Beijing  will help to establish order at border crossing points, in the  words of Andrey Kozyrev.    The question of the demarcation of the Russo-Chinese border  was raised at the press conference. This matter is proceeding  successfully but nevertheless there are several islands in  rivers along the border to which both sides lay claim. The fate  of these territories has not been decided yet. However, the two  countries' foreign ministers have agreed that this dispute must  not harm economic activity on the islands. This means  specifically that those Russians who are tilling the soil and  gathering hay on the disputed territories may continue with  their activities.</p>

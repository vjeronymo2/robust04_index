			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / CBI acts to keep down pay deals THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry will circulate to members up-to-date information on recent pay deals and pay freezes in an attempt to strengthen employers in pay negotiations. The employers' organisation will write to more than 400 members that have pay settlements due in January - one of the busiest months for pay deals - pointing out that the latest three months' rolling average of settlements to the end of November shows manufacturing pay increases falling below 4 per cent. The CBI normally publishes quarterly figures from its databank, but for the first time this month will start publishing monthly rolling averages. The organisation, representing companies that employ half the UK's workforce, said: 'We are anxious that members are aware of how rapidly the pay situation has changed since the last three quarterly figure when settlements averaged 4.2 per cent.' White-collar health service workers yesterday rejected the government's curb on public-sector pay rises and threatened to ballot on industrial action next spring when their wage increase is due. Delegates from the Nalgo union, representing 65,000 administrative and clerical workers, agreed to submit a claim for a 'substantial rise', including a 'significant' flat rate increase for the lowest paid. Its claim will be submitted in the new year with a settlement date of April 1. The meeting of delegates was the first large public-sector group to gather since the government announced it wanted to keep public-sector pay increases within a 1.5 per cent ceiling. Mr Paul Marks, Nalgo's national officer, said his members had shown that they would not accept being made to pay for the government's mishandling of the economy.</p>

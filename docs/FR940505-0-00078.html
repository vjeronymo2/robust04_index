These revisions and this action are necessary for several reasons. First, on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 26, 1988, the EPA notified the State of Louisiana that its SIP for attaining the National ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for ozone was substantially inadequate as it applied to the seven parishes comprising the Baton Rouge ozone nonattainment area: Ascension, East Baton Rouge, Iberville, Livingston,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pointe Coupee, St. James, and West Baton Rouge. This document called for the State to correct deficiencies in its Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Reasonably Available Control Technology (RACT) rules as they applied to those parishes. Second, on November 8, 1989, the EPA notified Louisiana that its ozone SIP was substantially inadequate as it applied to Calcasieu Parish, which comprises the Lake Charles ozone nonattainment area, and also called for the State to correct existing deficiencies in its VOC RACT rules as these applied to Calcasieu Parish. Third, the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) of 1990, required the State to revise its SIP to correct VOC RACT deficiencies within six months of enactment. Finally, the VOC RACT rules must be recodified to provide consistency between the State's code and the SIP. The effect of today's action will be to correct existing deficiencies in the VOC RACT rules of the Louisiana SIP as required by the EPA notices of deficiency and the CAAA and to recodify the VOC RACT rules to conform with the State's code. This action is being taken under section 110 and part D of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as amended by the CAAA of 1990. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  This final rule will become effective on June 6, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Copies of the documents relevant to this action are available for public inspection during normal business hours at the following locations: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Region 6, Planning Section (6T-AP), 1445 Ross Avenue, suite 700, Dallas, Texas 75202&hyph;2733. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Air Quality Division, 7290 Bluebonnet Boulevard, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70810.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Docket, 6102, Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Guy Donaldson, EPA Air Programs Branch at (214) 655&hyph;7214. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 24, 1987, the EPA's Proposed Post&hyph;1987 Policy for Ozone and Carbon Monoxide stated that air quality monitors revealed continued exceedances of the ozone standard in the Baton Rouge area of Louisiana and that a ``SIP call'' would be issued (See 52 FR 45044). A SIP call is a finding by the EPA that the SIP does not provide for attainment by the required date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  In a letter dated May 26, 1988, to Governor Buddy Roemer, the EPA notified the State of Louisiana that because the Baton Rouge area had failed to attain the NAAQS for ozone by December 31, 1987, as required under section 172 of the CAA, its SIP was substantially inadequate and would need to be revised. Later, on November 8, 1989, the EPA notified the State that its SIP as it applied to Calcasieu Parish was substantially inadequate to achieve the ozone NAAQS in that area (i.e., LakeCharles). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The EPA requested that the State respond to the SIP calls in two phases. Pursuant to the first phase, the State was to: (1) Correct identified deficiencies in the existing SIP's VOC regulations; (2) adopt VOC regulations previously required or committed to but never adopted; and (3) update the area's base year emissions inventory. Just as the Post 1987 SIP calls were being anticipated, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality recodified its air quality regulations. The bulk of this effort was conditionally approved March 8, 1989, at 54 FR 9783. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The VOC RACT rules were not approved as part of the recodification at that time because the majority of the VOC RACT rules as recodified were substantially changed from the rules previously approved as part of the SIP. This is because the State had revised its VOC RACT rules for various reasons, but the revisions had not been incorporated into the federally-approved SIP. Given the discrepancies between the State code and the SIP, the EPA decided not to approve the recodification of the VOC RACT rules to avoid confusing the public about which version was part of the federally-approved SIP. Now that the revised VOC regulations are considered acceptable, the EPA is simultaneously approving the substantive revisions and the recodification and will refer to the VOC RACT rules by the recodified designations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Under the pre-amended Act, section 110(a)(2)(H) provided for a finding by the Administrator that a ``plan is substantially inadequate to achieve the (NAAQS).'' This provision was carried forth under the amended Act. In addition, Section 110(k)(5) of the amended Act reinforces the Agency's authority to make such a finding. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To avoid repetition, hereinafter the Baton Rouge and Lake Charles SIP calls will be referred to as the Post 1987 SIP calls. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The conditional approval of the rules has not been changed to final approval because the State still has not submitted changes to correct certain errors in the recodified rules. Also, since the publication of that conditional approval, the EPA has found that one rule, previously thought to be unchanged, was changed substantially. The Agency issued a correction to the conditional approval (57 FR 8075, March 6, 1992) to note that the language of the recodified rule in question is not being approved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Post 1987 SIP calls, Congress amended the CAA on November 15, 1990. Public Law 101&hyph;549, 104 Stat. 2399, codified at 42 U.S.C. 7401&hyph;7671q. Under the CAAA, those areas that were designated nonattainment before enactment of the CAAA, and which retained that designation and were classified as marginal or above as of enactment, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  were required to meet the section 182(a)(2)(A) RACT fix-up requirement by May 15, 1991. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Baton Rouge and Lake Charles nonattainment areas are classified as serious and marginal, respectively, and therefore, are subject to the RACT fix-up requirement. Under section 182(a)(2)(A), those areas were required to correct RACT as it was required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under pre-amendment guidance. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Post 1987 SIP call letters interpreted that guidance and indicated corrections necessary for specific nonattainment areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Air monitoring data since the Post 1987 SIP call indicate that St. James Parish may have attained the NAAQS for ozone. It has retained its nonattainment designation but is classified as incomplete data. Therefore, St. James Parish is not subject to section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAAA. Louisiana will, however, have to correct any deficiencies regarding enforceability of existing rules applicable to St. James Parish before the parish could be redesignated to attainment. See the General Preamble 57 FR 13498, at 13525 (April 16, 1992). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Among other things, the pre-amendment guidance consists of those portions of the Post&hyph;1987 ozone and carbon monoxide policy that concern RACT, 52 FR 45044 (November 24, 1987); the Bluebook, ``Issues Relating to VOC Regulation Cutpoints, Deficiencies and Deviations, Clarification to Appendix D of November 24, 1987  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Notice'' (for which notice of availability was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  on May 25, 1988); and the existing CTGs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) adopted revisions to the VOC RACT rules in a series of actions making revisions to various sections of LAC:33:III: Chapter 1 (pertaining to General Provisions), Chapter 21 (pertaining to Control of Emissions of Organic Compounds), and Chapter 61 (pertaining to Test Methods). The first submittal in response to the Post 1987 SIP calls, sent to the EPA in a letter dated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> June 13, 1990 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , contained revisions to Chapter 21 as adopted on January 20 and February 20, 1990. The second submittal from the Governor, dated October 26, 1990, contained further corrections to Chapter 21 as adopted July 20, 1990. A third submittal dated May 9, 1991, contained revisions as adopted by emergency rulemaking procedures on May 1, 1991. A fourth submittal, received May 24, 1991, contained revisions to the VOC regulations adopted by the LDEQ on November 20, 1990, and April 20, 1991. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has already taken action on a portion of Louisiana's June 13, 1990, submittal. Those portions, Subchapter B, Organic Solvents, Section 2123, paragraphs C.6 and D.3, were approved on September 7, 1990 (55 FR 36811). Louisiana revised these sections pursuant to an Order of the United States District Court for the Western District of Louisiana in the case of United States v. General Motors Corporation. Civil Action No. CV87&hyph;1890S. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because the LDEQ could not meet the statutory deadline using its regular rulemaking procedures, it resorted to emergency procedures allowed under the State's Administrative Procedures Act (LSA R.S. 49:953(B), 30:2011, and 30:2054) to make final corrections to the VOC RACT rules. These procedures allow rules to be revised without public hearing but limit their effectiveness to 120 days. By using these procedures, Louisiana was able to make the required submission on May 9, 1991. However, since the rules are only effective for 120 days, the LDEQ also used its regular rulemaking process and adopted these rules again on July 20, 1991. These regulations were submitted to the EPA on March 26, 1992.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Louisiana emergency measures submitted on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> May 9, 1991, were not subject to notice and public hearing at the State level. Pursuant to section 110(a)(1) of the CAAA, the EPA requires States to submit SIPs and SIP revisions that the State has adopted ``after reasonable notice and public hearing.'' The State cured this defect through its submittal of March 26, 1992. At that time, the State resubmitted the same rules, after it fulfilled the public notice and hearing requirements. Therefore, the EPA is approving these submittals in this action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the same time that Louisiana submitted the rules that went through the public participation process, Louisiana  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resubmitted the recodification of the VOC RACT rules and submitted rules adopting capture efficiency test methods. Due to deficiencies in the recodified rules, they could not be approved when they were originally submitted. Because the deficiencies have now been corrected, the EPA can now approve the rules, and the State was asked to resubmit the recodified VOC RACT rules. The recodified VOC RACT rules, first submitted in 1988, serve as the baseline superseding all previous revisions concerning VOC RACT rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On September 30, 1992 (57 FR 45012), the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  to approve the above rules into the Louisiana SIP because they correct the specified deficiencies identified under the SIP call and satisfied the requirements of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAAA. For a complete discussion of the EPA's evaluation of the submitted rules, the reader is directed to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  document referenced above. The EPA provided a 30 day comment period on the notice of proposed rulemaking. No adverse public comments were received. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The EPA approves revisions to the Louisiana SIP as submitted on June 13, 1990, October 26, 1990, May 24, 1991, and March 26, 1992. These revisions to the VOC RACT rules satisfy the requirements of the May 26, 1988, SIP call for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Baton Rouge nonattainment area, the November 8, 1989, SIP call for the Lake Charles nonattainment area and the RACT fix-up requirements of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the CAAA. The recodification meets the requirements of section 110 and part D of the CAAA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities (5 U.S.C.603 and 604). Alternatively, the EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part D, of the CAAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP-approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-State relationship under the CAAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The CAAA forbids the EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Union Electric Co. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> U.S. E.P.A <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 427 U.S. 246, 256&hyph;66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nothing in this action should be construed as allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to any SIP shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economical, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action makes final the action proposed on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 30, 1992, at 57 FR 45012. As noted elsewhere in this document, the EPA received no adverse public comment on the proposed action. As a direct result, the Regional Administrator has reclassified this action from Table One to Table Two under the processing procedures established at 54 FR 2214,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> January 19, 1989. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by July 5, 1994. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. See section 307(b)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This action has been classified as a Table Two action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214&hyph;2225). A revision to the SIP processing review tables was approved by the Acting Assistant Administrator for Office of Air and Radiation on October 4, 1993 (Michael Shapiro's memorandum to Regional Administrators). A future document will inform the general public of these tables. Under the revised tables, this action remains classified as a Table Two. On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for two years. The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table Two and Table Three SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on the EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental protection, Air pollution control,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Hydrocarbons, Incorporation by reference, Intergovernmental <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations, Reporting and recordkeeping, Ozone, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Volatile organic compounds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: Februrary 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joe D.

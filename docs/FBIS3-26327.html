			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Fan Liqing (5400 7787 7230) and Fang Jin (2455 </F> 3866)]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Feb (XINHUA) -- Tang Shubei, executive  vice chairman of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan  Straits [ARATS], held a news conference this afternoon to field  reporters' questions on his talks with Jiao Renhe [Chiao  Jen-ho], vice chairman and concurrently secretary general of  Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation [SEF], over the past five  days. In assessing the talks, he said: The joint press release  born of the talks summarizes the results of the talks between  the two organizations in Xiamen and Taibei [Taipei] following  the "Wang-Gu [Ku] talks." It has positive implications for  strengthening cooperation between the two organizations and for  developing cross-strait relations.    Tang Shubei said: Because the Taiwan authorities last year  raised the question of "joining the United Nations," the Chinese  Government released a white paper entitled "The Taiwan Question  and Reunification of China," which led to a sharp political  standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait. Mr. Jiao  Renhe's current visit to Beijing for talks was good for the two  sides' eschewing political issues to settle routine matters. We  have always called on the two organizations to hold talks in the  spirit of respecting each other, holding consultations on an  equal basis, seeking truth from facts, and seeking common ground  while reserving differences. During five days of talks, the two  sides constantly coordinated their actions and reshaped their  opinions in light of the other side's views, thereby bringing  about an outcome that is acceptable to both sides. This  outcome, which was born of enhanced trust between the two sides,  is, in turn, good for increasing mutual trust.    In response to questions on the significance of explicitly  including in the joint press release plans for the two  organizations to exchange views or hold talks on a number of  economic, scientific, and technological issues during their  fourth round of talks on routine matters, Tang Shubei said:  ARATS has always called for incorporating the economic topics,  outlined in the "Joint Agreement on the Wang-Gu Talks," in the  agenda at the earliest possible date. Given the current  political differences between the two sides of the Taiwan  Strait, we believe that economic exchanges and cooperation can  promote closer relations between the two sides and that shared  economic benefits will widen our common political language.  Talks between the two organizations currently stress the  settlement of routine matters stemming from cross-strait  exchanges. Although this is the duty of both organizations, we  believe it is more important to promote the favorable  development of cross-strait relations through contacts and  cooperation between the two organizations. In this sense,  economic topics represent a very important aspect and are  forward-looking. The two organizations should actively promote  the development of cross-strait economic exchanges and  cooperation.    On the question of protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' rights  and interests regarding their investments on the mainland, Tang  Shubei said: The mainland has drafted the "Law on Protecting  the Investments of Taiwan Compatriots on the Mainland" after  reviewing the 22-article regulations on encouraging Taiwan  compatriots to invest on the mainland, after considering the  views of the SEF and Taiwan entrepreneurs, and after repeatedly  carrying out investigations and studies. Once it is approved by  the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the law will  serve as the single supreme law on the mainland that guarantees  Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment rights and interests. We are  not against holding discussions with the SEF on protecting  Taiwan entrepreneurs' rights and interests. We also hope to  include relevant economic topics during our fourth round of  talks. In accordance with the principle of mutual benefit and  reciprocity, we expressed our hope that Taiwan would open its  markets to mainland products, loosen restrictions forbidding  people from the mainland's industrial and business circles to  visit Taiwan, and carry out cross-strait cooperation in labor  services. On the basis of these moves, we do not exclude the  possibility of signing a people-to-people agreement with the SEF  on protecting Taiwan entrepreneurs' investment rights and  interests.    Asked by a reporter about his impression of Jiao Renhe, the  SEF vice chairman cum secretary general, Tang Shubei said: When  I first met and talked with Mr. Jiao, I had the feeling that he,  like his predecessors, was willing to actively promote the  development of cross-strait relations. Despite our differing  political stands, we share a desire to develop cross-strait  relations. Consequently, the two sides were able to surmount  difficulties and to reach several common understandings.    In response to the question of whether ARATS will set up an  office in Hong Kong, Tang Shubei noted: ARATS has not  considered this. The main targets of ARATS' contact are the SEF  and various mass organizations and people from all walks of life  in Taiwan. Now that the two organizations have established  channels of communication and are in close contact, there is no  need to set up a branch office in Hong Kong.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Address by King Norodom Sihanouk at the opening of the </F> third national congress of Buddhist monks held in Phnom Penh on  6 May -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] Today, I should dare to make  the following arbitration.    They [Khmer Rouge] [KR] must now stop fighting. Since they  have claimed to be the people's representatives, they should not  be afraid of the election. If they dare to take part in a  democratic election, I dare to ask Samdech Ranariddh, Samdech  Hun Sen, Samdech Chea Sim, and Samdech Son Sann to agree to a  new election. The pevious election was claimed to be  incorrectly held because it was organized by the UNTAC [UN  Transitional Authority in Cambodia], by the foreigners. They  said that. Now, we propose that a new election be held with  Sihanouk overseeing it. [applause]. Sihanouk will supervise it.  I would like to take this occasion to inform venerable monks of  this message. That is, Sihanouk will supervise and rearrange  (?with his neutral attitude) an election. They should be happy  with all the seats that they will get. Supposing that they can  get 50 seats, they will be able to control a large portion of  the power. Fifty seats will be a large portion. If they get 70  seats, they will be very strong. If they get 80 seats, they  will be able to do anything they like. Therefore, they should  agree.    Speaking before the venerable monks at this third congress  of  Buddhist monks, we are not joking. Let us hold another election  since they said the previous one was organized by the  foreigners, the UNTAC. Now, it will be held by Sihanouk whom  they recognize as their king. They have not yet rejected  Sihanouk. They said they only reject Samdech Ranariddh, His  Excellency [H.E.] Hun Sen, and Samdech Chea Sim. They do not  reject Sihanouk. Now, Sihanouk is willing, (?at this age), to  chair, to organize it. Sihanouk will go to all provinces to see  that the election is held correctly. Whoever will win or lose,  we will control the power in line with the laws and  Constitution. [Words indistinct] they must have heard about  this now because they have informants. They always hear about  everything we say. They are very smart. They have informants.  They always hear about everything at once.    Now, I would like to make this appeal that venerable monks  have also expressed their welcome just now. Now, if Samdechs  Ranariddh, Hun Sen, and Chea Sim have the spirit of  sportsmanship, of a so-called [preceding word in French]  sportsman, they should agree if the Khmer Rouge [KR] stop  fighting. Everyone should observe a standstill wherever he is.  They should be anywhere they are and stop oppressing, stop  killing the others.    We should play the game correctly. We should play the sport  correctly. That is, we should play the game of genuine  democracy by holding the election, the general election in all  provinces. We should hold the election again (?with all parties  taking part). [passage omitted]    On this occasion, they should think whether to agree, to  accept a reelection or they accept my other formula that they  should return all of their autonomus regions and then dissolve  their army, not 100 percent, [changes thought] to integrate it  into the Khmer Royal Armed Forces [KRAF] like the armies of H.E.  Son Sann, H.E. Sak Sutsakhan, Samdech Ranariddh, and Samdech Hun  Sen which are now KRAF, and then they themselves join the Royal  Government to share the power. However, some have said that the  FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an Independence, Neutral,  Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] or the Cambodian People's  Party disagreed. They said that it would be against the  Constitution for them to join the government. Even if the  constitution is amended, we can still refuse to accept them. In  the Sangkum Reas Niyum, not only those elected party members  were made ministers. The outsiders, such as experts, were  appointed ministers. The Constitution in that era did not  prohibit this. That was done to achieve peace, to eliminate the  impasse, the autonomous state.    If the Khmer Rouge agree to negotiate with this side, if  this  side kindly agrees to accept them into the government, there  will certainly be a way out. There will be a way out, but we  have continued to say no. Not only saying no and refusing to  allow them to join the government, but we have even (?rejected)  them through legal means by drafting a law declaring the Khmer  Rouge as the outlaws. By so doing, they will become even more  cruel.    At present, can we prevent them from entering the villages  and communes that belong to the FUNCINPEC and to the front of  H.E. Sak Sutsakhan to slash the throats of women there; can we  protect our people? Since we cannot protect our people, we  should agree to form a coalition with the Khmer Rouge. It does  not mean that we must agree with it unconditionally. We will  agree to do so only when the Khmer Rouge stop fighting, stop  killing, and stop having an army. They should intergrate their  army into the KRAF so that there will be only one army. Our  government will be a government of peace and national  reconciliation by including them in it. With that statement, I  was accused of desiring to help the Khmer Rouge. It is not that  I want to help the Khmer Rouge. I would not dare to lie before  the venerable monks here. Samdech Sihanouk only wants peace for  the nation. That is all. [passsage omitted]    Now there are these two options. Should we hold another  election, or should we refrain from the reelection and turn to  reconciliation by accepting the Khmer Rouge in the government  and their army in the KRAF? But will they agree with it? If  they disagree, national history (?will punish them). As for us,  we must now calculate what is right or wrong so that if  children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren suffer any loss of  life again, we will know clearly who are the wrongdoers.

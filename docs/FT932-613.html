			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Construction Contracts: Building Manchester's outer ring road COSTAIN BUILDING &amp; CIVIL ENGINEERING has recently been awarded an Pounds 18.2m Department of Transport contract to build the first section of the M66 Manchester outer ring road between Denton and Middleton. The contract covers a 1.4 mile section of existing road. The works comprise the reconstruction and realignment of the dual carriageway to a four lane motorway between the M62 and the A576 at Rhodes, the construction of a two-level junction at the A576, and a new section of motorway south of the junction. The river Irk will be diverted at Higher Blackley. This will involve the diversion of about 0.65km of the river, the construction of two weirs, and the use of specialist bank treatment techniques. Work on the project will start this summer and work is expected to take about two years to complete.</p>

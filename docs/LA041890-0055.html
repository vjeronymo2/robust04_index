			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: STAGE  </P> <P> Quick, Before the Phantom Disappears: Can the sizzling black-market ticket  prices for "Phantom of the Opera" get any hotter? Yes, if the tickets are for  Michael Crawford's final performances.  </P> <P> In one Times Classified ad Tuesday, tickets for Crawford's last date as the  phantom on April 29 were offered at $1,500 each. Four were available, and they  were listed as good orchestra seats. Compared to that, another ad offered  Crawford last-day tickets at a bargain basement price, two balcony seats at  $500 a piece.

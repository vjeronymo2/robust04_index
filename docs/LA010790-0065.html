			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ARMED MAN'S ARREST ENDS NIGHTLONG STANDOFF  </P> <P> An armed man who threatened a couple with a shotgun for several hours before  releasing them unharmed was arrested early Saturday after a SWAT team stormed  his Mission Hills apartment, Los Angeles police said.  </P> <P> Gordon Wilcox, 60, was arrested about 7:30 a.m. on suspicion of assault with a  deadly weapon after the eight-hour standoff, said Sgt. Bob Knapp of the Los  Angeles Police Department. He was being held on $7,000 bail at the Van Nuys  jail.  </P> <P> The incident began early Friday night when officers were called to the  apartment complex in the 11600 block of Blucher Avenue to resolve a dispute  between Wilcox and his female roommate, police said. The dispute continued, and  officers were called out again about 11 p.m.  </P> <P> Police spent several hours trying to talk Wilcox into surrendering because they  believed that he was holding the woman and an unidentified man at gunpoint,  Knapp said.  </P> <P> Wilcox allowed the woman to leave the apartment unharmed, then released the man  several hours later, he said. Wilcox had "pointed the shotgun at both of them"  during the incident, Knapp said.  </P> <P> A woman who identified herself only as Wilcox's roommate said she had argued  with him before he barricaded himself in the two-story apartment by shoving  furniture against the door, a neighbor said.  </P> <P> Neighbor Ray Banigan said he was allowed to remain in the complex until about 4  a.m., when he and his wife were evacuated just before a Special Weapons and  Tactics team stormed the residence. The SWAT team fired three rounds of tear  gas into the apartment to flush Wilcox out.  </P> <P> Wilcox placed his shotgun outside the door and withdrew into his apartment  shortly before the SWAT team broke down the door of his apartment, fearing that  he had more weapons inside. No other weapons were found, however.  </P> <P> Knapp said investigators have not determined why Wilcox barricaded himself in  the apartment.  </P> <P> Wilcox moved into the apartment three months ago and did not indicate that he  would have other renters, said Anna May, manager of the complex. Neighbors said  Wilcox was retired and had a military background.  </P> <P> On the door of Wilcox's apartment a sign reads: "There is nothing inside that  is worth your life. This is protected by an armed guard."  </P></p>

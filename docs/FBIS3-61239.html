			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Teslenko: "The Largest Diamond Deposit </F> Will Not Be Frozen"]    [Text] A representative conference on problems  related to development of one of the world's largest diamond  deposits in Arkhangelsk Oblast was held at the Roskomdragmet  [Russian Federation Committee on Precious Metals and Precious  Stones] yesterday. The conference considered several alternative  solutions. The principal discussion centered on a political  solution of the feasibility of beginning mining operations.    The Deposit imeni Lomonosov is situated in an  ecologically vulnerable area of the Arctic region with poor  soils and powerful subterranean aquifer beds. The deposit's  reserves are estimated at 130 million carats. The diamond  content per metric ton of ore is approximately 0.6 carat, and  about 50 percent of it is suitable for jewelry.    The "Severalmaz" AO [Joint-Stock Company] was formed by  government decision in 1992 to develop the Deposit imeni  Lomonosov. The principal stockholders are the Arkhangelsk Oblast  Property Fund (25 percent), "Arkhangelskgeologiya" (16 percent),  and "Atomredmetzoloto" (16 percent). The "Severalmaz" AO  submitted an application on 2 November 1992 to the Roskomnedra  [Russian Federation State Committee for Geology and the Use of  Mineral Resources] for a license to develop the deposit. It took  roughly a year in Moscow to coordinate the business plan, the  financial report, the operation's ecological feasibility report,  and other documents. In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts,  not one of the three alternatives for mining operations (See  table) is ecologically irreproachable. There has been no final  decision on the fate of the deposit thus far. This should have  been reached at yesterday's Roskomdragmet conference, to which  executives of the Roskomnedra, the Minprirody [Ministry of  Environmental Protection and Natural Resources], the Arkhangelsk  Administration, and the "Severalmaz" AO itself were invited.  Inasmuch as Arkadiy Lechugin, cochairman of the commission on a  tender to prospect in the seven areas containing diamonds in  Arkhangelsk Oblast, was present at the conference in Moscow, we  will report on the results of the bid (See KOMMERSANT-DAILY of  22 December) in tomorrow's issue.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Working Version of the TEO [Technical and Economic Feasibility] for Large--|  |Scale Development of the Imeni Lomonosov Diamond Deposit                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Parameter         |Underground Devel-|Open Development  |Development by Co-|  |                  |opment            |                  |mbined Method     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Total capital inv-|5.7               |5                 |6                 |  |estment, in billi-|                  |                  |                  |  |ons of dollars    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Period for deposi-|11                |9                 |21                |  |t's development,  |                  |                  |                  |  |in years          |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Intensivity of op-|5                 |5                 |5                 |  |eration, in milli-|                  |                  |                  |  |ons of metric ton-|                  |                  |                  |  |s annually        |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Period of deposit'|36                |28                |43                |  |s operation, in y-|                  |                  |                  |  |ears              |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Degree of diamond |66                |60*               |80*               |  |extraction from o-|                  |                  |                  |  |re, in percent    |                  |                  |                  |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |* According to KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts.                                   |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------     <FIG ID=FBIS-USR-004C-36A> Diagram Showing Location of Kimberlite Pipes in the Diamond Deposit Imeni Lomonosov </FIG>          KOMMERSANT-DAILY experts believe that several alternative  solutions could have been considered at the conference. The  first one is the freezing of operations at the deposit, with the  possible payment to the Arkhangelsk Administration of  "compensation" from diamond-mining Yakutia. The second one is a  recommendation to authorize the "Severalmaz" AO to undertake  large-scale development. The third alternative is to advertise  an international competition for the deposit. Finally, the most  likely alternative is experimental-industrial development in the  first stage (2 to 3 years) of two small pipes by two different  technologies (an underground working and an open cut).    As Leonid Gurevich, deputy chairman of the Roskomdragmet,  told a KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent, the conference managed to  "make substantial progress." In the opinion of KOMMERSANT-DAILY  experts, this means that the first alternative (freezing the  deposit) was turned down.</p>

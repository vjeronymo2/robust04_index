			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Malik Altaf Hussein: "Talbott's Visit: Hopes and </F> Fears"]    [Text] The U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott  returned to the United States on 12 April after his two day  visit to Islamabad. Mr. Talbott had discussions with the  president, the prime minister, the foreign minister, and other  important officials. There was no limited agenda for these  talks. The earlier impression was that these talks would  especially focus on the nuclear program and Kashmir. Mr. Talbott  himself said in a press conference later that they had  discussions covering a broad agenda. In addition to Middle East  and South Asian affairs, establishment of peace, the nuclear  program, Kashmir, and trade, they also discussed bilateral  regional affairs. The joint communique issued at the conclusion  of his visit announced the "greater agreement" between the two  countries and the representatives of both countries called the  visit very successful.    There is concern in Pakistan over the situation under which  the U.S. representatives visited our country. The feeling about  the United States in Pakistan was not very good because of the  suspension of U.S. military and economic aid, pressure on the  nuclear program, and coolness over the Kashmir issue. Every  Pakistani was watching the U.S. deputy secretary's visit to New  Delhi and Islamabad very closely. If we take a close look at  Talbott's visit and listen to government sources, we will not be  able to believe that this trip was successful from Pakistani  perspective. It would have been called successful if the U.S.  pressure on the Pakistani nuclear program was lifted, a promise  to reinstate military and economic aid was made, a desire was  expressed to deliver the F-16s, the cost of which was already  paid, some proposal was made to reduce the pressure put by the  Pressler amendment, an emphasis was given to resolve the Kashmir  issue according to the UN resolutions, some major trade plan was  brought to light, or some words about Pakistan were said like  were used for India calling it the leader of this region and  outside of it (even though all neighboring nations are suffering  from India's expansionist designs and its craze for war).  However, we have to say with great sadness that if we carefully  analyze the joint communique, and the statements he gave at the  press conferences in New Delhi and Islamabad, we do not see any  thing that can hint that the U.S. delegation has proposed any  concrete and realistic plan to protect Pakistan's interests.  Instead, we see a beautiful play on words in the joint  communique and any other words that the U.S. deputy secretary  uttered. In the end, Pakistan gets "nothing" and the United  States keeps "everything."    Talbott's statements and the joint communique indicate that  Pakistan's point of view was not listened to. It appears that  the U.S. and Indian interests were the big winners in this  visit. These goals and concerns can be understood by the points  raised below.    Mr. Talbott announced in the New Delhi press conference that  he needed proof of Pakistan freezing its nuclear program. F-16s  will not be delivered if the nuclear program is not rolled back.  The United States does not favor Pakistan, will not force India  and Pakistan to sign the NPT [Nonproliferation Treaty],  recognizes India as a leader even outside this region, and the  Kashmir issue is to be resolved by holding bilateral talks  according to the Shimla accord. Let us take a brief look at how  these views expressed by the U.S. deputy secretary of state in a  press conference in New Delhi support the Indian view point and  goals.    Without criticizing or expressing concern over India's eight  reactors which have been worked on day and night for military  purposes or India's nuclear blast in 1974, the asking for proof  of Pakistan's freezing its nuclear program is accepting the  India point of view. Pakistan's decision to unilaterally freeze  its nuclear program was a great show of goodwill and cooperation  towards the United States and India. Pakistan did not get any  "incentives" from the United States or India in exchange.  However, instead of thanking Pakistan for this exemplary act of  cooperation, they increased pressure on Pakistan. The talks  about not delivering F-16s is also according to Indian wishes  although Pakistan was talking about the F-16s that are already  paid for. "The United States does not lean toward Pakistan,"  these words were also delivered according to India's wishes. It  was not necessary to say this since Pakistan is an older and  more trusted friend in contrast to India. Mr. Talbott's  announcement that the United States will not force India and  Pakistan to sign the NPT is also favoring India on this point.  India has continuously declared that it will not sign the NPT  even when Pakistan signs it. The Indian prime minister repeated  this stand a few days before Mr. Talbott's visit. The original  U.S. position was that both India and Pakistan should sign the  NPT. Pakistan would have benefitted from this U.S. stand and it  is based on fairness. The governments preceding Benazir Bhutto  had adamantly demanded that Pakistan and India should sign the  NPT together. The United States had also endorsed this stand.  The U.S. announcement that it will not force India and Pakistan  to sign the NPT is creating a new situation which will benefit  India only. This will, however, increase tension in this region.  The words, "India is the major leader in this region," clearly  prove that the United States wants to give an "important role"  to India in this region. It wants to influence Pakistan's  relations with China, Afghanistan, newly independent Central  Asian republics, and Iran. The idea of resolving the Kashmir  issue by holding bilateral talks according to Shimla accord is  also part of Indian policy. Since talks between India and  Pakistan during our 45 years of history have never been  successful, the Kashmir issue cannot be resolved with these  talks. Actually, India wants to use these talks as an excuse to  buy time to crush the Kashmiri freedom fighters. The most  effective way to resolve the Kashmir issue is to implement the  UN resolutions. However, the deputy secretary never mentioned  the UN resolutions in New Delhi or Islamabad and the Pakistani  foreign minister did not remember it, either.    After this brief review of hidden U.S. and Indian interests  in Mr. Talbott's statement given in the New Delhi press  conference before leaving for Islamabad, let us discuss what he  said after reaching Islamabad. Did he give any breaks to  Pakistan on arriving here or only decisions that serve U.S.  interests?    1. The first success the U.S. deputy secretary had in  Islamabad was Pakistan's submission of the proposal to freeze  its nuclear program. In other words, Mr. Talbott's statement  delivered in New Delhi that "I will get proof of freezing the  nuclear program in Pakistan" was recognized here immediately.  Even more troublesome is the decision for the two countries to  do all this through "confidential diplomacy." What does this  "confidential diplomacy" mean? When Pakistan has officially  declared a freeze on its nuclear program, why do we need  "confidential diplomacy" to get proof for it? The Pakistani  people were already told that the nuclear program has been  suspended. What confidential information that might create  public outcry is left to be told to the United States? The truth  is that the secret in this "confidential diplomacy" is the one  that made the United States win the Cold War and the Soviet  Union lose it. The fear is that Pakistani government wants to  roll back its nuclear program while practicing this  "confidential diplomacy." It should be clear that Pakistan's  nuclear program was frozen in July 1990 through this  "confidential diplomacy." As for the proof of freezing the  nuclear program, these are the words that are being used to  deceive Pakistani people. How is it possible that the United  States has no proof of this freeze introduced in 1990? The truth  is that just like the way this "confidential diplomacy" was used  in July 1990 to freeze Pakistan's nuclear program, it will be  used now for taking the "next step." The word "confidential"  here is not used because of some international protocol, it is  being used to keep the Pakistani people "ignorant" of facts.  These words of mine get support from our national hero Dr.  Qadeer Khan's careful words, "I have nothing left to say. I will  talk when I have something to say."    2. Regarding our foreign ministry's spokesman's statement  that Pakistan will not accept unilateral and discriminating  restrictions on its nuclear and missile program, [we ask] why  did we give up our principled stand on signing the NPT and agree  to resolve these issues by "confidential diplomacy?" Further, if  the talk about providing proof of freezing the nuclear program  is not equivalent to accepting discriminating restrictions, then  what else is it? Has India taken such a step to freeze its  nuclear program and provide proof of it through "confidential  diplomacy?"    3. The joint communique did not promise any military and  economic aid to Pakistan and did not mention F-16s. All it said  was that Pakistan's military and political interests will not be  hurt. In other words, despite recognizing Pakistan's defense  needs, no assurance of concrete assistance was given. More  concerns were expressed over the situation in Kashmir, but  India, who is responsible for all this, was not criticized.    The truth is that Mr. Talbott's visit to Pakistan was in  connection with "rolling back" Pakistan's nuclear program and  talks about a broad agenda was floated to hide this. If there is  any truth about this broader agenda, then some decisions about  Pakistan's concerns and problems should have been brought to  light. However, it appears that Mr. Talbott did "fill his file"  while Pakistan's drawer remained closed. All our concerns,  problems and needs were just given some flat comments and left  as were before.    Anyhow, the present government is sure of coordinating the  "U.S. friendship" and "our national interests." However, the  situation indicates that the government has to sacrifice either  the U.S. friendship or our national interests.</p>

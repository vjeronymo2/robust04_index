The meeting  was also attended by World Federation of Hungarians President  Sandor Csoori.    According to the government spokesman's office, Boross  stressed his desire to follow the late prime minister Jozsef  Antall's political concept regarding native Hungarians in the  Carpathian basin.    In keeping with the government's August 1992 declaration, he  proclaimed his continued support for all endeavors of  cross-border Hungarians, formulated by their legitimate  representatives in accordance with European integration ideas.    Leaders of Hungarian organizations beyond the border  confirmed this as the minimum which they expect from Hungary's  government and which they regard as a basis for future relations  with Hungary. The sides stressed the role of such links in  strengthening Central European stability.    Ethnic Hungarian leaders said they continue negotiations in  an effort to attain recognition as a national community, enforce  their regional and community self-governing rights on the  principle of subsidiarity, and create partnership relations with  the majority nations of their countries. To this end, they wish  to use democratic means in expressing their political identity.    Boross said the principles professed by legitimate Hungarian  organizations are in full harmony with the basic ideas of  European integration and the Maastricht Agreement.    As several models similar to the plans for settling  positions  of the concerned communities have proven viable in Europe, the  government of the Republic of Hungary supports the just  endeavors of cross-border Hungarians by all possible, lawful  means at their disposal.    Participants of the meeting assessed previous efforts aimed  at bringing about a European stability agreement. They stated  that such an accord can only fulfill its mission in stabilizing  Central and Eastern Europe if the governments and the legitimate  representatives of the national communities reach an  understanding on the legal status of the given community.    The Hungarian Government believes this can also furnish  adequate conditions for talks on the conclusion of bilateral  agreements designed to ensure the region's long term stability.    The sides noted major, positive steps in bilateral ties  between both the governments and ethnic Hungarian organizations,  and between Hungary and the governments of Croatia, Slovenia,  and Ukraine.</p>

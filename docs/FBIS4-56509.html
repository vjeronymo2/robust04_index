			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 4 May (NA) -- The Buenos Aires  delegates to the Constituent Assembly from the Radical Civic  Union [UCR], Modin [Movement for Independence and Dignity], and  the Grand Front (FG), today agreed "not to support the immediate  reelection of the current Buenos Aires governor and vice  governor, a decision which is meant, they said, to "comply with  the responsibilities of their mandates." [quotation marks as  received]    After the meeting among the leaders and delegates of the  three political forces, which was held at UCR headquarters, they  released a five-point document stating that the amendment of the  Constitution "requires an effort by the political forces to  attain a constitution that reflects the people's will as  expressed on 10 April."    It also points out the need to "intensify democracy by  strengthening the civic liberties, rights, and well-being of the  inhabitants of Buenos Aires Province."    "In order to meet these objectives, we hereby request the  support of all the political parties participating in the  Constituent Assembly, and invite the Justicialist Party  delegates to hold a joint meeting," the second point of the  document states.    In addition it establishes that "in compliance with the  electoral commitment assumed with the Buenos Aires public," the  position of rejecting the possibility of reelecting the  provincial governor will be maintained.    The FG, Modin, and UCR delegates also said that they "reject  the introduction of any kind of subterfuge in the constitutional  reform that seeks to alter the public's decision to oppose the  immediate reelection of the current provincial governors."    Finally, the delegates maintained that the Constituent  Assembly "must be carried out within a pluralistic framework  that guarantees the openness of its decisions and of its  expenses."</p>

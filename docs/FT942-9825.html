			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Warner Howard up 16% and sees further growth Warner Howard, the hot air hand dryer and laundry equipment company, overcame a 4 per cent decline in turnover to report its eighth consecutive year of profits growth with a 16 per cent advance at the pre-tax level. Mr Ernie Hazell, managing director, said he was confident the current year would show further growth. The rate of business failures, which hit the group hard in 1993, had slowed noticeably in recent months. The final dividend 'which is a sign of that confidence' is increased by 15 per cent to 5.04p, for a total 12 per cent higher at 7.31p. Earnings benefited from a lower tax charge to advance 21 per cent to 21.07p. Warner Howard, which boasts 75 per cent of the UK market for rented laundry equipment, reported pre-tax profits up from Pounds 5.91m to Pounds 6.84m in the year to February 28, on sales Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 22.2m. Operating profits of Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 5.92m) included profits of Pounds 112,000 (Pounds 337,000 losses) from discontinued activities. The drop in turnover reflected the absence of a Pounds 1m contract in 1993 to sell laundry equipment to hotels in the former Soviet Union. Mr Hazell said the profits on that contract had been so slim that the absence of the business had not affected profits. The rentals division, which supplies laundry, hygiene and catering equipment, remained 'the engine of growth', with sales 7 per cent ahead at Pounds 13.5m giving operating profits of Pounds 6.7m, a rise of 12 per cent. The lower margin equipment sales division suffered a Pounds 1.2m drop in turnover to Pounds 5m and operating profits halved from Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 200,000. The service division showed a 19 per cent drop in sales to Pounds 3.7m, with profits falling from Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 700,000. Mr Hazell said the group was seeking to be more active on the acquisition front, in particular to build its hygiene and catering equipment divisions. Warner Howard had already completed its first purchase this year, paying Pounds 1.02m for a hygiene rental portfolio. The purchases would almost certainly be funded through either cash flow or by gearing up the balance sheet. Warner Howard has net cash of Pounds 600,000.</p>

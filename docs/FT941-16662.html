			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / London Stock Exchange: US buyers return to boost FT-SE 100 stocks - Market report The London stock market rounded off the first week of 1994 with a convincing display of confidence yesterday afternoon when excellent news on US employment soothed fears that interest rates might be forced higher on the other side of the Atlantic. Renewed buying of stock index futures by the big US securities houses drove the FT-SE Index up by 43 points to 3,446, within 16 points of the previous closing high reached just after Christmas. Although the US payroll statistics appeared to have been leaked on the previous day, London warmly welcomed the formal announcement that non-farm payrolls had risen by a mere 183,000 in December, far below market estimates. Nervousness over prospects for rates in the US earlier this week had helped unsettle London's confidence that domestic base rates would be reduced in the near term. At first, the UK market seemed set for another uncertain performance, with the Footsie stocks lacking support while the FT-SE Mid 250 Index continued to blaze ahead. But share prices began to move up half an hour before the US news came. On the announcement, the March contract on the Footsie jumped to a substantial premium and London traders identified several of the large US buyers of the London futures who had pushed the Footsie ahead in December. A brief pause for consolidation was followed by a renewed advance as the marketmakers again found themselves short of stock to meet the assault. The Footsie has moved erratically this week as marketmakers have sought to rebuild trading books which were badly stretched during the hectic advance just before Christmas. However, the refocusing of attention on the Footsie stocks did nothing to slow progress in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which climbed 63.5, breaking through a new barrier to close at a new peak of 3,912.5. At last night's close of the first leg of the equity account, the FT-SE 100 Index showed a gain of 27.6 on the week but the FT-SE Mid 250 was 121.2 points or 3.2 per cent ahead. The recovery of confidence seen over the past two sessions has been reflected in high trading volume. On Thursday, Seaq volume of 1.02bn shares brought retail business worth Pounds 2.02bn, one of the best daily totals for twelve months. However, Seaq business increased again yesterday, totalling 1.05bn shares. The soothing of interest rate worries also inspired the gilt edged market, where short dated issues moved higher. The best gains, however, came in the longer dates where renewed confidence that inflationary pressures will stay low added as much as 3/4 of a point to bond prices. Index-linked gilts, after a slow start, edged higher towards the end of the session. Equity traders expressed satisfaction with the resilience of the stock market over the past two sessions, which has seen the Footsie bounce over 90 points from Thursday morning's low point of 3,355. Earlier in the week, the market had run into profit-taking as fund managers showed signs of turning away from the highly rated Footsie-listed stocks, preferring to move towards the FT-SE Mid 250 list. The re-appearance of US buyers for London equities was regarded as highly positive for the UK market and lends support to the highly favourable forecasts for the first half of 1994 from most local market analysts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["U.S. Imperialist Aggressors Stage Patriot Missile </F> 'Operation Demonstration'" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The command of the U.S.  imperialist aggression forces occupying South Korea opened to  the public on Friday one battery of Patriot missiles at the Osan  base in Kyonggi Province and staged an "operation  demonstration", according to a radio report from Seoul.    The U.S. military incited war fever against the North,  declaring that "it is prepared to go into action any moment".    It clearly shows what extent the war hysterics of the U.S.  imperialist aggressors against the DPRK has gone that they are  even displaying patriot missiles, bringing the situation to a  dangerous phase over its fictitious "nuclear issue."</p>

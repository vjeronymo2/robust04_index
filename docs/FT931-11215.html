			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Still looking for a cut DEALERS in the sterling money market assumed that the prospects of another UK rate cut before the March budget were diminishing after the pound fell to historic new lows against the D-Mark yesterday morning, writes James Blitz. The UK authorities announced that they would be closely monitoring sterling's exchange rate as the currency fell to a historic new low on its trade weighted index. The implication was that the currency's fall could be of sufficient concern to ward off another rate cut in the next few months. However, far from assuming that there would be no more rate cuts, dealers simply took the view that the cut to 5 per cent was more likely in the summer rather than the spring. The March short sterling contract fell 9 basis points to a low of 94.21, before closing at 94.30. At this level, it assumes that 3-month money at budget time will be at 5.70 per cent. The September short sterling contract rose 5 basis points to close at 94.80. At this level, it assumes 3-month money will be at 5.20 per cent by the autumn, a level that is clearly compatible with 5 per cent base rates. The shape of the futures yield curve indicates that rates should rise after September. However, the curve in the sterling cash market continued to decline down to about 5 3/4 per cent for 1 year money. Dealers in European interest rate markets were more overtly concerned about currency tensions inside the European exchange rate mechanism. One-month French francs touched 13 per cent as the Danish krone fell to its floor against the D-Mark. The March French franc contract fell 24 basis points from its opening level to close at 88.50. The Bundesbank was slightly more generous than had been expected in its weekly repo, accepting a lowest bid of 8.57 per cent. But neither this, nor the absence of concrete news on the public sector wage talks in Germany, indicated what the Bundesbank will do at its council meeting today on rates. Any bullishness was founded on the idea that pressures in the exchange rate mechanism made a cut in official rates more likely at today's council meeting to restore calm. The March Euromark contract closed up 5 basis points at 92.14.</p>

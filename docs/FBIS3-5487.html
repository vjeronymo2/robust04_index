			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 8 KYODO -- A senior official of the  Trade Ministry opposed a proposal Tuesday [8 March] for Japan to  set quantitative goals in macroeconomic fields as part of its  efforts to cut its huge trade surplus.    Japan should not make the achievement of a specific ratio of  current account surplus against gross domestic product (GDP)  into a government commitment, said the official, who declined to  be identified.    It is impossible for the government to guarantee the  fulfillment of such a pledge, the official said, explaining that  current account balance figures are easily affected by external  factors beyond government control, such as crude oil prices.    The official at the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry [MITI] was commenting on Monday's proposal by the  Japan Association of Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai) to  reduce the profit ratio to 2 percent of the GDP within three  years.    To set such an economic goal is tantamount to the "numerical  targets" Japan has repeatedly rejected in trade talks with  Washington as managed trade, the official said.    He said Tokyo cannot go beyond seeking to achieve "a highly  significant decrease" in its current account surplus as agreed  during the Japan-U.S. summit in July 1993.    The comments came amid growing calls from both within and  outside the government for Japan to set some macroeconomic goals  in order to mend the soured economic ties with the United States.    The Foreign Ministry, for example, proposed the GDP profit  ratio be cut to 2.8 percent for fiscal 1994 from the 3.1 percent  estimated for the current year.    On a revival of a U.S. trade provision known as Super 301,  the MITI official said he feels the step is designed to smooth  the way for a breakthrough in the Japan-U.S. trade dispute  rather than targeting Tokyo for retaliation.    Under the provision, Washington will identify trade  practices  it finds unfair to U.S. products, using findings from an annual  survey on global trading practices set for release at the end of  March. The U.S. administration would then have until September  30 to pinpoint priority countries engaged in unfair trading.    The U.S. may have selected a September deadline, rather than  an earlier one as previously expected, to reflect Washington's  consideration toward Japan and give it more time to take market-  opening steps, the official said.</p>

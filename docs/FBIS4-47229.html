			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Decree: "Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic </F> of Uzbekistan: `Changes in the Retail Prices for Flour and  Bread'"]    [Text] As a result of the increase in the expenditures for  purchasing, transporting, and processing grain, the Cabinet of  Ministers decrees:    1. To establish, effective 1 June 1994, retail prices for  flour at the average of 500 som-coupons and for bread at the  average of 400 som-coupons per kilogram.    2. Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance is to make  known to the interested ministries and departments the new  prices for flour and bread, with a consideration of the variety  of items being produced.    3. To consider to be no longer in effect decree of the  Republic of Uzbekistan Cabinet of Ministers, dated 28 February  1994, No. 100.    [Signed] A. Mutalov, prime minister of the Republic of  Uzbekistan    Tashkent, 30 May 1994    At the Republic of Uzbekistan Ministry of Finance, the  Uzbeksavdo State Association, and Uzbekbirlashuv    Taking into consideration the continuing increase in the  expenditures to purchase and transport food products from abroad  and to produce and process the republic's own resources, as well  as the need to protect the domestic market and thwart attempts  to ship food products illegally beyond the confines of the  republic, the Uzbeksavdo State Association and Uzbekbirlashuv,  jointly with the republic's Ministry of Finance, have decided to  introduce, effective 1 June 1994, the following average retail  prices for the basic food products, including those for which  norms are applied:    -- flour: 500 som-coupons per kilogram;    -- bread (white, coarse, rye): 400 som-coupons.    In conformity with Cabinet of Ministers decree No. 360, as  long ago as July 1993 the decision was made to release the  prices for the basic food products. By that decision the  Uzbeksavdo Association and the board of governors of  Uzbekbirlashuv, jointly with the republic's Ministry of Finance,  and proceeding from the current market condition and the actual  expenditures for purchases, were instructed to establish  flexible prices for a group of food products to which norms  would be applied: vegetable oil, sugar, tea, and meat.    It must be noted that a considerable quantity of food  products are brought into the republic from the so-called "near  and far abroad." Moreover, all types of food products are  purchased at world prices, only in exchange for freely  convertible currency. For example, one ton of wheat on the world  market costs $130, which, recomputed at the official rate of  exchange, is 500,000 som-coupons. Consequently, a kilogram of  grain, not counting the cost of shipment, costs the state 500  som-coupons. Therefore, even with the new prices for bread and  grain it is necessary to set aside from the state budget every  month subsidies totally more than 28 billion som-coupons.    It is also necessary to emphasize that the new prices for  the  basic food products in Uzbekistan, if they are recomputed at the  exchange rate of the Russian ruble, prove to be lower than, for  example, in Russia or Kyrgyzstan:    Uzbekistan     RussiaKyrgyzstan                  in som-coupons       in          in          in       in                                      Russian     Russian     soms     Russian                                      rubles      rubles               rubles   Bread,         400                  191         532         1.88     283  kilogram   Flour,         500                  238         443         1.47     222  kilogram      As a result of the increase in the prices of petroleum and  other fuel resources that are being delivered to the republic,  and also for purposes of increasing the effectiveness of the use  of energy resources and guaranteeing the stable operation of the  branches of the national economy, new retail prices are being  introduced, effective 1 June 1994, for fuel and energy resources  and rates for the services of urban and suburban passenger  transportation:                                Unit of measurement        Retail price (tariff)                                                         in som-coupons per                                                         unit   Natural gas                 1000 cubic meters          3500   Electrical energy           kilowatt/hour              30   Electrical energy           kilowatt/hour              15  provided to the  population for apartment  buildings equipped with  electric stoves   Motor-vehicle gasoline,     liter                      1000  average   Coal, average               ton                        25,000   Hauling of passengers by    1 trip                     100  urban transportation  (motor bus, subway,  streetcar, trolleybus)   Hauling of passengers by  suburban motor buses:   general type                per kilometer of trip      17   with upholstered seats      per kilometer of trip      25      In addition, the state sets aside considerable subsidies for  all the types of energy resources and transportation services  that were indicated above. For example, with a consideration of  the new prices and tariffs, in terms of one month's  expenditures, urban passenger transportation will require  subsidies each month of no less than one billion som-coupons;  energy producers, 0.7 billion; gas producers, 8.6 billion; and  coal producers, 3.6 billion som-coupons. Moreover, in Kazakhstan  the natural gas that is sold to the population is more expensive  than in our republic (in terms of Russian rubles) by a factor of  19.2; and in Kyrgyzstan, by a factor of 23.7.    For purposes of preserving social guarantees for the  population, the republic's government regularly reconsiders and  increases wages, pensions, scholarships, and other payments. By  the most recent edict of the President, effective 1 June 1994  the minimum wages and minimum work pensions are established,  respectively, at 70,000 and 75,000 som-coupons. Wages in  organizations financed by the budget and scholarships paid to  students at institutions of higher learning, technicums, and  occupational-trade schools have been increased by a factor of  1.5.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> A DAY IN THE PARK  </P> <P> Knapp Ranch Park  </P> <P> 25000 Kittridge St., West Hills  </P> <P> Size: 82 acres.  </P> <P> Facilities: Three baseball diamonds, outdoor basketball court, children's play  area, football field, picnic area, four tennis courts.  </P> <P> Hours: 9 a.m. to dusk daily.  </P> <P> Information: (818) 887-9800.  </P> <P> The rolling hills that make up Knapp Ranch Park's trilevel facility once was  the prize ranch of Walter Knapp. But in 1962, Knapp moved from the area and  sold the land to the Los Angeles Recreation and Parks Department for roughly  $200,000, with one stipulation -- that the park be dedicated to the memory of  Knapp's son. Edwin Frank Knapp, who as a child loved playing on his father's  wooded ranch, was 21 when he was killed during World War II. Today, a plaque  stands at the park's entrance in memory of Edwin Knapp.  </P> <P> "It's a quiet park, a very nice place to take a family or spend an afternoon,"  said Al Goldfarb, a spokesman for the department. "And that's how Walter Knapp  wanted it to be used."  </P> <P> Knapp Ranch Park, which is built on a hill that is graded into three flat  planes, has an outdoor basketball court on its lowest level, tennis courts on  its middle level and baseball diamonds at its peak. Nearly all the trees that  made up the original ranch are still on the grounds, and there are picnic  tables scattered among them. It does not have the community events that mark  some parks, but it is one of the few places in the San Fernando Valley that  still has the peace and tranquility of 20 years ago, Goldfarb said.

			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei below 16,000 on earnings pessimism THE Nikkei average fell below 16,000 for the first time since August 20 on pessimism about corporate earnings and the continued delay in Diet debates, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index fell 169.51 to 15,993.48 after a morning low of 15,941.93 on arbitrage selling and an afternoon high of 16,100.90. Volume recovered to 200m shares from Monday's 124m, the second-lowest level since August 3. Declines led advances by 670 to 228 with 165 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks lost 11.19 to 1,221.33 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index dropped 3.52 to 979.92. In the morning, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, revealed rule changes for initial public share offerings in order to attract individual investors. Investors ignored the announcement. Comments by Mr Kozo Watanabe, the minister of international trade and industry, that the Nikkei average should be at 18,000, considering the competitiveness of Japanese companies, also failed to boost sentiment. Investment trusts, which have been the leading buyers recently, stuck to the sidelines. Public pension funds were also absent. Foreigners have also been leading sellers of the market. One fund manager at a leading life assurer said that the index was expected to fall to 15,000. Bank shares met widespread selling on worries over bad loans. Rumours that hedge funds were targeting bank shares for short-selling also sent jitters through the market. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y80 to Y2,230 and Fuji Bank lost Y70 to Y1,690. Electronics lost more ground on earnings worries. NEC fell Y2 to Y608 and Matsushita Electronic Industrial retreated Y20 to Y1,040. Hitachi, however, rose Y3 to Y703 on bargain-hunting. The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in Gajoen Kanko, the hotel operator involved with Itoman, the scandal-tainted textile trader, after Gajoen's accountants refused to certify its interim earnings report. TSE officials said the shares could be delisted if Gajoen failed to rewrite its earnings report and obtain a final certificate. In Osaka, the OSE average lost 92.63 to 17,467.72 in volume of 25.6m shares. Ono Pharmaceutical gained Y80 to Y5,290, but Aoyama Trading, the men's clothing company, fell Y70 to Y7,380 on profit-taking. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets were more concerned with domestic matters than Tokyo's drop. In Bombay and Calcutta, Indian brokers boycotted trading in protest against registration fees imposed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India. HONG KONG saw waves of panic selling after a veiled threat about the future of the colony issued in London by Chinese vice premier Zhu Rongji. The Hang Seng index fell to 6,046.74 before bargain-hunters came in, and closed down 206.31 or 3.3 per cent at 6,088.52. Turnover was moderate at HKDollars 3.76bn. HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 62.50. AUSTRALIA broke a seven-day decline on bargain-hunting and the All Ordinaries index finished 7.8 up at 1,365.1 in turnover of ADollars 210.2m. ANZ closed unchanged at ADollars 2.53 after reporting a ADollars 579m loss which the bank blamed partly on write-offs in its property portfolio. NEW ZEALAND was lifted by a better than expected first half result from Telecom Corp and the NZSE-40 capital index ended up 9.46 at 1,418.97 in turnover of NZDollars 24.9m. SINGAPORE ended higher on a technical rebound following Monday's losses on news that both the country's deputy prime ministers had cancer. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 19.38 to 1,433.65 in volume of 111.2m shares against 130.4m. SEOUL ended firmer in moderate trading on a technical rebound led by Kepco shares. The composite index closed 14.78 higher at 631.42 in turnover of Won440.96bn compared with Won370.68bn. Kepco shares rose Won800, the daily upper limit, to Won20,500, on expectations that the company will permit direct but limited foreign investment at its shareholders' meeting on Friday.</p>

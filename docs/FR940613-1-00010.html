			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prequalification requests that are approved, on the other hand, will be reported on the HMDA&hyph;LAR at a later stage in the process, after homebuyers have found the property they want to purchase and the lender has evaluated a formal loan application, not at the time of the prequalification approval. Thus, the lender will report when: (1) the lender originates a loan; (2) the lender has made a firm loan offer that the applicant does not accept; (3) the applicant expressly withdraws the mortgage application; (4) the lender closes the file for incompleteness; or (5) the lender denies the mortgage loan application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In some cases, lender decisions on prequalifications that are approved may ultimately not be reported on the HMDA&hyph;LAR; if a homebuyer who has been prequalified for credit does not later pursue a formal application for a mortgage loan, the lender has no reporting obligations under HMDA (and no notification requirements under Regulation B).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For denials of prequalification requests that are reportable under HMDA, there are questions about how a lender can comply with the reporting requirements with regard to the loan amount, loan type, and property location data fields on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. Generally speaking, a property location will not ``exist'' at the prequalification stage if the prospective homebuyer does not yet have a purchase contract on, or has not requested financing for, a specific property. Thus, the lender should enter NA (not applicable) in each of the location fields in such instances. For loan amount, if the prospective homebuyer has not requested a particular amount of credit, the regulation currently does not provide any alternative code. The Board requests comment on whether a code such as NA (not applicable) will suffice, or whether a special code_indicating that the transaction is a prequalification_would be more appropriate and useful. Similar issues arise with respect to loan type in cases where prospective borrowers have not specified during the prequalification process the type of loan they are seeking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Board requests comment about other compliance issues related to prequalifications, and contemplates that guidance regarding these matters will be provided in the commentary to Regulation C to be issued later this year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting of refinancings.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regulation requires lenders to report refinancings, which are defined as loans involving the satisfaction of an existing obligation and its replacement by a new obligation undertaken by the same borrower. The Board solicits comment on the reporting of transactions that are not technically refinancings, but that serve as the functional equivalent of refinancings. In some regions, transactions are structured as modifications of existing obligations (sometimes called modification, extension, and consolidation agreements or ``MECAs''), rather than as replacements thereof, often in order to reduce borrower costs associated with a refinancing (for example, title insurance fees).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Institutions have inquired whether they should report such transactions, which serve the same purpose as refinancings and normally entail the same underwriting procedures. The Board solicits comment on this matter. The Board also solicits comment on what types of modifications should not be subject to reporting (such as the simple modification of a loan term from 25 to 15 years), as well as the basis for any such distinctions. Other issues on which comment is requested include whether the reporting of such transactions should be limited to cases where a new lender is offering the modification, or should also be available to the original lender.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another matter on which the Board seeks comment concerns the current exclusion for certain refinancings based on the purpose of the transaction. Under existing Regulation C, a refinancing is to be reported only if the loan being refinanced was a home purchase or home improvement loan, or was a refinancing of such a loan. In addition, a refinancing is reported only if the amount outstanding on the loan being refinanced, plus the amount of any new money for home purchase or home improvement purposes, is equal to more than 50 percent of the total new loan amount. For example, if a borrower refinances a home purchase loan only for the purpose of getting a lower interest rate on the outstanding balance, and therefore does not obtain any new money, the refinancing is reported because the amount outstanding on the original loan is equal to 100 percent of the new loan amount. Similarly, if a borrower refinances a home purchase loan and obtains new money to be used entirely for home improvement purposes, then again the refinancing is reported because here again, the amount outstanding plus new money for ``covered purposes'' (home improvement and home purchase) is equal to 100 percent of the new loan amount. At the other extreme, if a borrower refinances a loan with an outstanding balance of $20,000 and obtains $40,000 of new money to be used for starting a new business, the refinancing is not reported because the amount outstanding plus new money for ``covered purposes'' is equal to only one-third of the new loan amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This purpose test for determining whether refinancings are to be reported under Regulation C has generated a substantial number of questions from lenders. For example, the purpose of the loan being refinanced may not be clear at the time the borrower applies for the refinancing. In some cases, a loan has been refinanced repeatedly, new money having been obtained each time; and the calculations necessary to determine whether more than 50 percent of the total new loan amount is for covered purposes become difficult. An alternative approach that would be easier to understand and apply would be to treat all refinancings as subject to reporting on the HMDA&hyph;LAR. Although such an expansion in coverage would result in the disclosed data's being less tied to the home purchase and home improvement categories, it is not clear that the resulting data would be less useful. The Board solicits comment on the advantages and disadvantages of these changes, both for reporting institutions and for users of HMDA data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

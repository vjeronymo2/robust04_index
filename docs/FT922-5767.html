			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Shine starts to fade / Investigating the D-Mark's decline THE Deutsche Mark has lost something of its shine in recent months. Since the beginning of the year, what has traditionally been Europe's strongest and most stable currency has lost ground against the US dollar, against sterling, and and against other currencies in the European Monetary System. The slippage in the currency's value since the beginning of the year - from DM1.53 to nearly DM1.61 against the US dollar by the middle of May, from DM2.85 to DM2.93 against sterling over the same period - indicates a significant deterioration of sentiment. Whether this reassessment is the prelude to a more radical shift in perceptions remains to be seen. Many commentators take the view that the Bundesbank, arch-defender of monetary stability, has taken the right decisions and is undergoing problems amid the turbulence of this year's wage round. According to these analysts, the Bundesbank's determination to fight the battle against inflation is undiminished - and, more importantly, its credibility is intact. However, there is a minority view that the Bundesbank's determination to do battle with inflation has already faltered - but that the market has not yet cottoned on to this. According to this line of argument, when market perceptions catch up with the new and unfortunate reality, there will be a new and more permanent downgrading of the value of the D-Mark. The stark facts of the matter are that year-on-year inflation in Germany reached 4.8 per cent in March - more than twice the Bundesbank's target of 2 per cent. Money supply M3 - the broad measure which is a key indicator for the Bundesbank's monetary policy - grew at an annual rate of 9.75 per cent in the same month, again way above the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. Has the Bundesbank done enough to counter these trends? Or, is it succumbing to international pressure and letting itself be bullied into keeping rates too low for Germany's domestic situation? The Bundesbank moved last December, raising Lombard and Discount rates by a half a per cent. At the time, the rise to 9.75 and 8 per cent (Lombard and Discount rates respectively) took investors by surprise. Economists expected at the most a rise of 25 basis points. The move to Germany's highest post-war interest rates was taken as evidence of the central bank's unwavering commitment to the goal of price stability. Reflecting the markets' confidence, Bund prices surged, with yields on 10-year long Bunds tumbling from well over 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent and lower. The psychology behind this paradoxical rise in bond prices in response to a rise in interest rates was due to investors' conviction that the Bundesbank had knocked inflation on its head once and for good. The rise would encourage the unions to behave responsibly in the forthcoming wage round and allow the Bundesbank to chop headline rates again by the third quarter. As events unfurled, this prognosis began to look optimistic. Unions - first the steel workers and then the public sector workers - showed themselves unwilling to defuse inflationary pressures by accepting pay increases below the level of real inflation. The powerful IG Metall union was also in sabre-rattling mood, and, like the public sector, settled for a basic 5.4 per cent. The consensus date for the lowering of rates crept backwards by the week - from late in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. From today's viewpoint, even the first quarter of next year looks extremely optimistic. Perhaps interest rates might have to go up again first. The Bundesbank has so far maintained its credibility, a fact reflected in a steeply inverted yield curve. Interest rates at the long end of the market are sharply lower than short-term rates, 150 basis points apart in fact, because the markets still believe the Bundesbank will win. And some argue that the Bundesbank has been right not to overreact to money supply figures which to a large extent reflect non-inflationary rebuild of eastern Germany. However, argues Avinash Persaud at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - under the headline 'Crumbling credibility?' - 'a number of new pressures may restrain the Bundesbank from responding to the worrisome acceleration in monetary growth. If these pressures are seen to influence the Bundesbank, market perception could evolve'. From being perceived as Europe's most active central bank, it could suddenly be seen as merely reactive, Mr Persaud argues, with dire consequences. Mr Persaud identifies three pressures on the Bundesbank policy-making, two international and the other domestic in nature. First, Germany's economy is slowing down, and may slip into recession - may the Bundesbank not be tempted to ease rates to stimulate growth? Second, the US has cut its own interest rates aggressively to kick-start its own and by extension the world economy - and it is attempting to bring pressure to bear on Germany to follow suit. Third, there are specifically European pressures on Germany: Germany's European partners are putting political pressure on the German government to keep rates low. As the former Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, indicated in a recently published book, Bonn rode roughshod over the Bundesbank in 1990, forcing through better monetary union between the two Germanys at a much more generous exchange rate than the central bank wanted. At a time when Bonn does not want to rock the European boat, the Bundesbank may find itself under intolerable political pressure once again - this time to keep interest rates lower than required.</p>

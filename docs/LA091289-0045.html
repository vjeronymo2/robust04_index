			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> BYRD OFFERS $10-BILLION ANTI-DRUG PLAN  </P> <P> The Democratic chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee called for an  across-the-board cut in federal spending to finance a $10-billion package of  anti-drug funding -- some $2 billion more than the $7.9 billion proposed by  President Bush. The sweeping proposal by Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W. Va.), which  could face a Senate vote as early as today, would devote substantially more  money to drug education and treatment programs than the Bush Administration  package without undermining its law enforcement initiatives. The Byrd plan  marks the first comprehensive Democratic alternative to the Administration  proposal. The plan, endorsed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R.  Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and other key Democrats, would reduce spending on all  discretionary programs next year by .58%.  </P></p>

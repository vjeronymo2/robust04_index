			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / Egyptian PM escapes Jihad bomb blast Mr Atef Sikdi, Egypt's prime minister, yesterday escaped an assassination attempt by Islamic militants after a powerful bomb exploded beside his motorcade near his home in northern Cairo, killing a schoolgirl and injuring at least 11 others. Mr Sidki, 63, was unscathed. Jihad, an extremist Islamic group, immediately claimed responsibility. The bombing was to 'avenge the blood of the martyrs', a reference to Jihad members killed by security forces or sentenced to death in recent trials. The attack is the third failed assassination attempt on an Egyptian minister in eight months. Mr Safwat al-Sherif, information minister, survived a shooting near his home in April, while Mr Hassan al-Alfi, interior minister, was injured when a bomb exploded near his motorcade in central Cairo in mid-August, an attack also claimed by Jihad. Six cars parked 800 metres from the prime minister's home were damaged by the blast; one, presumed to have contained the bomb, was destroyed. Mr Sikdi, on TV a few hours after the attack, warned the government would toughen its clampdown on Islamic extremists. 'We are going to control this by all feasible, and any other means,' he said. Eight members of Jihad, which its members claim is a revival of the group which assassinated President Anwar Sadat in 1981, were sentenced to death on terrorist charges last month. Nearly 40 extremists have been condemned to death since the government introduced special military courts earlier this year, and 18 have been hanged. The government's security operations have led to an abatement in attacks on tourist targets and bombings in the Egyptian capital, although tit-for-tat killings of Moslem extremists and police have persisted in in Upper Egypt. Since last year 210 people have died in extremist violence. Another 400 alleged members of Jihad are scheduled for trial, facing possible death sentences, in the next few months.</p>

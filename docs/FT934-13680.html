			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Survey of Derivatives (4): ERM crises quicken activity - Currency Products SINCE THE late 1980s, the trade in currency derivative products has been one of the fastest growing sectors of the foreign exchange business. But successive crises in the European exchange rate mechanism in the past year have given this sector a stimulus that few dealers could have anticipated. Until a few years ago, the personnel on a bank's derivatives desk were often regarded as unusual figures - more akin to rocket scientists than currency traders. In its infancy, the currency derivatives market was a supply-led business, with banks spending huge sums on the research and development of products which, they hoped, would allow customers to hedge risks. The growing participation of institutional investors in currency dealing over the past five years gave currency derivatives an initial boost. Institutions such as pension funds and insurance funds have greatly increased their purchase of overseas assets in recent years. They have been keen to hedge the exposure of these assets - like bonds and equities - to exchange rate moves. That is why they have purchased derivative products which allow them to lock in to established exchange rates. But it was the recent crises in the ERM that led to an explosion of interest in this area. The departure of sterling and the Italian lira from the system in the autumn of 1992 was followed by the momentous decision to widen the bands for most ERM currencies to 15 per cent on August 2 of this year. With currencies fluctuating over much wider areas, investors have rushed to hedge their exposures. 'There has been a 5 to 10 per cent increase in the use of these products over the past 12 months,' said Mr Patrick Allaway, managing director of Global Foreign Exchange at Swiss Bank Corporation in London. 'Institutions are facing volatility in European cross-rates for the first time, and that is making derivative products much more attractive.' One of the principal instruments that investors use is the forward contract, which allows him or her to purchase or sell a currency at an exchange rate that is set at a fixed date in the future. The other popular alternative is the currency 'option'. This gives the customer the opportunity to buy or sell a currency if it should 'strike' a certain exchange rate. The contract is paid for by means of a premium which is set by the bank. The main customers for these instruments tend to be leading institutional investors or multinationals with payments and receiveables in different currencies. It is selective clientele - and that may be derivative products are not cheap. There are two reasons for this: The increase in exchange rate volatility in recent years has made it riskier for banks to write options. In August 1992 and July 1993 - the height of the ERM crises - premiums were selling at some three times above their normal levels. The volatility has subsided, but premiums on European currency options are still higher than normal. Second, options can be expensive because they are often tailor-made for a particular customer. Options can be bought on an exchange, but the most attractive variants are over-the-counter options (OTCs) which a bank designs for an institution's particular requirements. According to Mr Allaway, the most attractive options today are 'basket' options, which allow a currency to be hedged against a group of European currencies. That option might be bought by a customer who is unsure what specific trades he will be making in European currencies over a given period of time. Another popular variant is the 'down-and-out' option. This allows a customer to let the option lapse if the exchange rate moves in a direction which is favourable to him. The attraction of these options is their lower premium. However, if these are tools increasingly used by the principal customers, then they are also being provided by an ever smaller elite of commercial banks. The research and development investment required to be at the forefront of the derivatives business is so great that only a handful of players can afford it. Mr Allaway says that some 90 per cent of the turnover of the business is controlled by just six banks with a strong presence in London - and their market share is increasing. Moreover, banks have to be very careful about participating in a business where losses can - theoretically - be astronomical. In the ERM crisis of September 1992, some French banks were thought to have been extremely badly burned by the exposure of their derivatives teams to exchange rate movements. So, successful option teams need to have very clear management structures around the business. They also have to provide sufficient capital to hedge the 'underlying' moves that follow the writing of any options. The banks are confident that they can manage this business. But governments and central bankers are increasingly concerned about the possibilities of a credit default in the derivatives sector that would destabilise markets. Earlier this year the Bank for International Settlements said that it might extend the amount of cash cover that commercial banks had to set against the risks that were being taken in their derivatives operations. There are also concerns that the growth of the derivatives market could intensify the flows in spot foreign exchange markets in a way that would also be destabilising. At the moment, the options business accounts for around 3 per cent of total turnover in foreign exchange. But some currency managers believe that this is enough to impact some 10 per cent of the total flows in the spot market. Some dealers believe that if options were to account for a 10 per cent share of all turnover, these instruments would be generating around half of all the flows in the market. There is a danger that this would create extreme volatility at certain times, providing another headache for central bankers who are trying to regulate the operations of foreign exchange dealers.</p>

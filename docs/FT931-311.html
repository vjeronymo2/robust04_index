			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Merloni Elettrodomestici posts L21bn foreign exchange loss Merloni Elettrodomestici, the Italian white goods group best known for its Ariston, Indesit and Scholtes brands, has become the most conspicuous Italian victim of last year's currency turmoil with a L21bn foreign exchange loss. Currency factors and a L8bn charge for redundancies and early retirements led to a collapse in group net profits to L1.6bn last year from L11.7bn in 1991. The fall in earnings has prompted a sharp dividend cut, with the payout for ordinary shares being reduced to L20 from L45 and that on savings stock falling to L50 from L65.</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (10): Sharper edge needed - Industry seeks a wider technology base SOUTH KOREA'S rapid rise to a position in the world's top league of semiconductor producers is testimony to its ability to acquire, develop and manage high technology. Yet having scaled such technical heights in one of the most demanding industrial fields, it is in danger of lagging behind its competitors in the deployment of technology in the more mundane industries that make up the bulk of its export sector. 'Increasing the level of technology in every field of industry is our top priority,' says Mr Choi Gak Kyu, deputy prime minister and head of the Economic Planning Board. 'Every industry needs to upgrade its technology. We must deepen our industrial structure by substituting domestic output for imports of components and materials.' That industry is intent on applying more technology to offset higher labour costs is evident from a surge in factory automation equipment imports, much of it from Japan. These have been rising at annual rates of 20 per cent or more in recent years, according to government statistics, and could amount to more than Dollars 1bn in 1992. Nor is there any doubt that technology transfer forms a part of virtually every industrial deal with foreign companies, though some observers doubt whether that such technology is always fully absorbed and efficiently employed. The growing network of government research laboratories boasts 'many people who are as good as any in the world', according to western diplomats. And industry spending on research and development has risen sharply in recent years. But there are question-marks over the corporate sector's R&amp;D efforts. Some observers point to the behaviour of many of the big companies in 1986 and 1987, when they were flush with cash. The profits then went mainly into speculative property and stock market dealings rather than into R&amp;D. Some Korean companies, such as Samsung Electronics, have earned international reputations for being at the cutting edge of semiconductor technology. But the evidence is less clear that companies across the board are investing the very large amounts in pure research and product development which would be needed to lessen their ties to foreign, and especially Japanese suppliers of components and high value equipment. Mr Duck Soo Han, director general of the industrial policy bureau at the Ministry of Trade and Industry, accepts that the 'technology gap won't be solved easily'. But he contends that a combination of tax incentives, a government policy to encourage collaboration and the importation of key foreign technologies will help. In addition, the government has identified strategic industries which it believes will be the basis for South Korea's future competitiveness. These include the following: new generations of semi-conductors, including the development of a 64 Megabit Dram by 1993 and a 256 Megabit Dram by 1996; development of a variety of high definition television equipment, including HDTV monitors by 1993, transmission technology by 1994 and flat panel displays by 1997; the commercialisation of a multi-media computer by 1994. Some critics, however, contend that the government plan is over-ambitious. One European engineer familiar with the HDTV programme, for example, believes that 'only a half a dozen Korean engineers really understand the technology.' Mr Choi denies that the high technology effort is spread too thinly, noting that Korea's priorities fall well short of those in more developed countries, where the emphasis is on 'fine chemicals, aerospace, biotechnology and new materials'. He adds that 'decisions on R&amp;D projects should equally consider economic viability as well as technological feasibility.' The relatively thin layer of engineering talent in the country has caused some companies to search widely for new recruits. One of the most technologically advanced companies, Samsung Electronics, is seeking to lure Korean-Americans back to their former homeland. It is also trying to hire Russian scientists and engineers, either individually or as a team, though it has so far failed to reach any agreement. 'We don't care what nationality a person is,' says Mr Hun Kim, a senior Samsung executive. But such sentiments may not be heard in the corridors of other Korean conglomerates, which have a reputation for being highly nationalistic. They also have a reputation - among many western business executives atr least - of being less than respectful of intellectual property rights and for being reluctant to pay for foreign technology. This is particularly the case when they are buying the innovative engineering services which will be needed in ever-larger amounts, according to Mr John Lyle, Seoul branch manager of HW Structures, part of the UK's Hawtal Whiting Group. He believes that the 'complexity of design and development is rarely understood at government or senior management level', in large part because Korean industry has had a manufacturing bias. 'There is still an emphasis on importing licensed technology and manufacturing ready-made designs,' he says. 'Purchasing innovative engineering services costs money and sometimes the effort needed to develop these skills is not understood by Korean companies.' But Mr Lyle believes Korean companies are beginning to understand that 'if you pay yesterday's prices, then you get yesterday's technology'. The sheer size and dominance of Korea's big companies can also deter technology transfer. Dr Berthold Leibinger, president of the German Machinery and Plant Manufacturers Association, the VDMA, said recently in Seoul that German medium-sized companies found it hard to find suitable Korean partners. 'It's very difficult for a German company with 500 or even 2,000 employees to deal with a Korean one employing 50,000,' he notes. Government policy is to encourage the start-up of small, innovative technology-based companies. But there may still be more than a grain of truth in the joke which asks: 'What is the first thing a Korean entrepreneur does?' The answer is: 'He goes to the States.' Mr Choi at the EPA accepts that the shortage of small specialist suppliers is a weakness which must be overcome, in part through a recently announced loan programme. But government officials believe long-term technological competitiveness can only come through the reform of the chaebols into more focused entities.</p>

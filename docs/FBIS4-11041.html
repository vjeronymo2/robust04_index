			<p>BFN     [Text] Salta, 20 Apr (NA) -- Demonstrators and police  clashed again today in the main plaza of the city of Salta when  a provincial teachers demonstration degenerated into serious  disturbances.    The disturbances took place in the plaza, where police  chased  and beat demonstrators, including an elderly lady who fell on  her back.    As a consequence, four university students were arrested in  the Casino de las Nubes, where they had sought refuge.    The Human Rights Commission was able to get the arrested  students taken to the Medical Culture House and not to a police  precinct.    This is yet another chapter of the very long struggle by the  provincial teachers to obtain payment of money they are owed  within the framework of a conflictive situation.    Some 2,000 provincial teachers participated in today's  demonstration. They marched along demanding salary improvements.    Teachers from the provinces of Buenos Aires, Formosa,  Cordoba, and Santa Fe participated in today's demonstration to  show solidarity with their Salta colleagues.</p>

			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad shareholders reject Sugar's bid for privatisation Amstrad shareholders appear to have firmly rejected Mr Alan Sugar's bid to take the company he founded private again with a 30p-a-share buy-back offer for the stock he does not already own, writes Paul Taylor. Although shareholders attending today's Amstrad meetings could still approve the deal if proxy votes were withdrawn and reversed, Mr Sugar's advisers conceded that it was now 'technically possible but practically impossible' for the bid to succeed. Based on the 13,086 proxy forms received by 2.15pm on Tuesday, 7,827 shareholders or almost 60 per cent were against Mr Sugar's proposed 'scheme of arrangement'. Amstrad has 31,000 shareholders and under one test of support Mr Sugar's proposals needed the backing of at least half those shareholders voting in person or by proxy to proceed. Under a second test of support, Mr Sugar also had to win the support of three quarters - or all but 93.9m - of the 375.6m Amstrad shares he does not already own. His bid has also failed this test on the basis of the proxies received.</p>

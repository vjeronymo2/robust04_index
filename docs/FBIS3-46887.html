Telecoms is one of the four priority areas in ongoing  bilateral trade framework talks. The negotiators are scheduled  to wind up their discussions before February 11, when Japanese  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and U.S. President Bill Clinton  meet to assess the entire talks.    According to the sources, this week's discussions centered  on  how to determine objective criteria in the telecoms field to  measure any progress.    The U.S. asked Japan to use the average market share of  foreign products in other developed nations as the objective  criteria, but Japan did not agree, they said. They said the  U.S. is looking for indicators which can be used to measure  concrete progress, but Japan is concerned that such indicators  would be regarded as targets to which it would be required to  meet.    If the working-level negotiators cannot come closer to  agreement on the issue, the decision may have to be left to  subcabinet-level talks, the sources said.    They said the negotiators also discussed whether purchases  by  Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. and other large  organizations should be included in the category of the  government procurement, but no agreement was reached on this  point either.</p>

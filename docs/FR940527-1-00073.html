			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This leads to a third concern, that the graduation of the scaled per diem amounts may generate inappropriate incentives to transfer patients as soon as possible, that is, before the point at which costs equal payments. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incentive could arise, for example, for cases in which payments early in a patient's stay are greater than costs (that is, cases with more even costs throughout the stay rather than high costs in the first day or two). In such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, the longer the patient stays in the hospital, the more likely that total costs will approach total payments. Under this scenario, a hospital seeking to maximize its profit could do so by transferring the patient as soon as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to address these concerns and to pay hospitals more appropriately for the treatment they furnish to patients before transfer, we are proposing at &sect;412.4(d)(1) to pay transfers twice the per diem amount for the first day  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of any transfer stay plus the per diem amount for each of the remaining days prior to transfer, up to the full DRG amount. We believe this method will improve the payment equity for transfer cases in a straightforward way while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alleviating our concerns about a steeply graduated per diem based directly on regression coefficients. We are proposing that this change be applied uniformly for both medical and surgical transfer cases; although surgical transfer cases appear to be more costly, on average, the first day, they are relatively less costly for the second day and beyond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Using the graduated per diem methodology we are proposing, RAND estimated the payment-to-cost ratio of transfer cases that were transferred prior to reaching the geometric mean length of stay would be 0.9321. While this is somewhat less than the payment-to-cost ratio for nontransfer cases (0.9645), it represents a significant improvement over the current ratio for these cases (0.7224).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since publication of the September 1, 1993 final rule, RAND has completed the second and final phase of its study. This phase of the study focused on the receiving hospitals and how they fare under our current transfer payment policy. Their findings in this regard were more ambiguous than in the case of sending hospitals. RAND performed regressions on transfer cases in receiving hospitals to determine whether these cases were more expensive than nontransfer cases within the same DRGs. They found no consistent relationship.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over 60 percent of all transfer cases were assigned DRGs from MDC 5 (Diseases and Disorders of the Circulatory System). According to RAND, ``*&blank;*&blank;* for the surgical DRGs in MDC 5 (DRGs 104 through 116), the costs of transfer cases relative to nontransfer cases at the same hospital range from almost the same (in DRG 106, coefficient = 0.007) to about 11 percent greater (DRG 105, coefficient = 0.105). In the medical DRGs in MDC 5, the range is even wider, with transfers received into DRG 121 and 122 actually costing less than other cases in the same DRG at the same hospital and transfers received in DRG 127 costing 37 percent more.'' (See RAND page 40.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these results, RAND did not recommend and we are not proposing any change in the payments for the receiving hospital in a transfer episode. That is, if the receiving hospital is also the final discharging hospital,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> they will be paid the full DRG amount plus any outlier payments they are eligible to receive (under either the day or cost outlier thresholds). If the patient is transferred again prior to discharge, then, under the change we are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing, the sending hospital in this second transfer episode would be paid using the graduated per diem methodology, rather than the flat per diem rate they currently receive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Review of DRG Assignments (&sect;412.60)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the provisions of &sect;412.60(d), a hospital has 60 days from the date of the notice of the initial DRG assignment of a claim to request review of that assignment. The hospital may submit additional information as part of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its request. The intermediary reviews the request and any additional information and decides if a change in the assignment is appropriate. Any change by the intermediary to a higher-weighted DRG must be reviewed by the hospital's Peer Review Organization (PRO) to determine if the request and the change are appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the first PRO contract cycle, this review was conducted on a postpayment basis. However, the second PRO contract, effective July 1, 1986, required that this review be conducted on a prepayment basis. Therefore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;412.60(d)(2) currently provides that the intermediary must request that the PRO review any change in assignment to a higher-weighted DRG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nigeria warned cash crisis may hit oil output Multinational oil companies in Nigeria foresee a decline in the industry unless the government can raise its investment in production and exploration over the coming year. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation owns 60 per cent of the joint ventures with the multinationals, but has failed to maintain its share of the operating costs, which average about Dollars 150m a month, and was up to five months in arrears by last month. The Nigerian government says it has cut the arrears owed to its partners to Dollars 350m but the multinationals put the figure at close to Dollars 500m. The government figure is based on arrears dating back to the start of 1993, but some of the debts go back to at least 1991. The government and the oil companies also differ on the investment needed to maintain current levels of output. The government budgeted for Dollars 3.13bn total investment in 1994 but wants to cut this to Dollars 2.2bn and has asked the oil companies to reduce this year's operating budgets. Mr Don Etiebet, the oil minister, is trying to secure as much government investment as possible for the industry but faces competing claims from other ministries, which argue that NNPC's share of the budget is too large and want to spend the money on other projects. Mr Etiebet recently told the oil companies that selective cuts in exploration and some operating costs would not reduce production capacity. The oil majors acknowledge that some reduction is made necessary by the government's lack of cash and the drop in the oil price but warn that a Dollars 900m cut in the budget will bring down production capacity next year. 'By next year it will have a substantial impact on production and the operations cannot just gear up quickly after such a sharp cut,' according to an industry expert in Lagos. '"The first thing that we will cut is exploration,' said one oil company executive. 'We are also postponing some new projects for a year or so. If that does not produce enough savings we will have to reduce maintenance.' Nigeria's oil fields contain lots of small reservoirs and new which last a short time before a new well is needed. The oil companies are already reducing their drilling programmes, as it costs at least Dollars 7m to drill a new well. The drilling contractors and other oil service companies have been the first to feel the effects of the recession in Nigeria's oil industry. 'We plan to stop drilling any more wells by August,' said an executive at one of the multinationals yesterday. 'If that happens across the board some of the contractors are going to pack up and leave Nigeria, putting a lot of Nigerians in the oil producing areas out of work.' The government has ruled out divestment of its equity as a solution to the cash crisis, but risks a cut in its Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota if it allows its production capacity to drop. Mr Etiebet recently argued for a cut in Opec's production to boost the oil prices but Nigeria is keen to increase its quota when the market picks up. The government denies that it is exceeding its Opec crude oil quota of 1.865m barrels a day, which it claims is supplemented by 175,000 b/d of condensate from the Mobil Oso plant. Last year Nigeria was aiming to boost its 2.3m b/d capacity to 2.5m by 1995, but oil companies warn that it could drop well below 2m by next year.</p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS, ANTEATERS PICKED TO TRAIL BIG WEST  </P> <P> UC Irvine suffered through the worst basketball season in school history in  1989-90, but the Anteaters were not picked to repeat their last-place finish in  the Big West Conference in a poll of conference coaches Wednesday.  </P> <P> That distinction fell to Cal State Fullerton, which has lost its top two  scorers, Cedric Ceballos and Mark Hill, from a team that finished seventh last  season. UC Irvine was picked to finish ninth.  </P> <P> "I was prepared for that," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. "When you look at  who's returning around the league and the fact that Wayne (Williams) is our  only returning starter, I can understand that. I'll tell you this, though. I  don't think we'll be the No. 10 team."  </P> <P> Nevada Las Vegas, the defending NCAA champion and preseason No. 1 in many  national polls, was picked unanimously to win the Big West.  </P> <P> UNLV is awaiting the result of its appeal to reverse a ruling barring the  Rebels from defending their NCAA tournament title. A decision by the Big West  on whether to allow UNLV to play in the Big West tournament will be made only  if the NCAA announces that the ban will stand, conference officials said.  </P> <P> New Mexico State, which tied UNLV for the regular-season title last season and  lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament, was chosen second.  </P> <P> Irvine, which set a school record with a 15-game losing streak last season, won  three of its final six games to finish 5-23. Four players from that team --  seniors Ricky Butler and Jeff Herdman and sophomores Dylan Rigdon and Jeff Von  Lutzow -- are expected to start against UCLA in Irvine's season-opener Nov. 23  in the Great Alaska Shootout.  </P> <P> Big West Conference Men's Basketball Coaches' Poll  </P> <P> Team (First-Place Votes) Points  </P> <P> 1. Nevada Las Vegas (10): 100  </P> <P> 2. New Mexico State: 84 1/2  </P> <P> 3. Cal State Long Beach: 80 1/2  </P> <P> 4. UC Santa Barbara: 73  </P> <P> 5. Pacific: 54 1/2  </P> <P> 6. Utah State: 45  </P> <P> 7. Fresno State: 35  </P> <P> 8. San Jose State: 31 1/2  </P> <P> 9. UC Irvine: 26  </P> <P> 10. Cal State Fullerton: 20ROBYN NORWOOD  </P></p>

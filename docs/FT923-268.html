			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Kohl reaffirms need for strict policies MR HELMUT KOHL, the German chancellor, yesterday reaffirmed his commitment to keep financial and budgetary policies under rigid control as a gloomy report from the respected Ifo economics institute hit share prices. The chancellor and Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister, had stressed the need for strict policies at a meeting with industrialists in Mr Kohl's office because they were important for the confidence of commercial and financial markets, a government spokesman said. Meanwhile, the DAX Frankfurt stock exchange index shed more than 2 per cent following a report of a sharp downturn in business expectations for the next six months. The Ifo economics institute in Munich said expectations across a wide range of companies taking part in its monthly survey had 'considerably worsened' following a marked fall in new orders last month. Many were planning to reduce production because cuts so far had failed to reduce inventories. The car industry is expected to be particularly hard hit. An industry trade group said orders this year would be a quarter to a third lower than 1991. Mr Achim Diekmann, director of the German Automobile Association, the industry's main trade group, said employment in the industry, including suppliers to the vehicle manufacturers, would fall by 100,000-200,000 from the total 1.7m employed in the sector. Mr Diekmann also said order backlogs for German car manufacturers to August this year had fallen 'by half' compared with the same period last year. Business conditions in the east have also deteriorated. Order intake among manufacturers fell 20 per cent in July, according to the economics ministry. Overseas demand fell by more than half. The collapse which followed a 20 per cent rise in June reflects highly volatile trends which have marked the progress of the east German economy since the virtual disappearance of buyers from former markets in the ex-Soviet Union and elsewhere in eastern Europe.

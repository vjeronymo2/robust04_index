			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (7): Optimism in the longer-term - International retailers target Russia - Fashionwear retailers from Britain, Germany and Scandinavia have ambitious plans for new outlets in Russia International retailers are increasingly seeking to carve out a significant market niche in Russia, a country short on quality retail outlets. In Moscow and larger cities, entrepreneurship is thriving and shops are beginning to transform themselves from mere distribution points to much more attractive sales venues. Stockmann, Finland's premier retail group, experienced a jump in retail sales in Russia from less than Dollars 10m in its first year of operation in 1989 to an estimated Dollars 65m this year. Sales in the six months to end-June surged by more than 60 per cent, helped by the opening of a new clothing store in Moscow in December 1993, and the summer 1993 opening of a grocery store in St Petersburg. Less than 5 per cent of all products sold are locally sourced, providing important opportunities for foreign product suppliers. According to Ilkka Arvola, director in charge of international operations at Stockmann, sales per square foot are currently almost double those in Finland, and shrinkage of 2 per cent is comparable to Finnish operations. Profits, he claims are 'very satisfactory,' in spite of a tendency towards higher taxes and customs duties. The company plans to open a full scale department store in St Petersburg in 1996, and later in Moscow, but Stockmann is still searching for an appropriate location. Meanwhile, Littlewoods, the international retail and leisure conglomerate, doubled the trading space of its first two stores - opened in St Petersburg in 1991 - last year and now has five stores in Russia, with annual sales of around Dollars 10m. Basic fashion commodities sell particularly well and the company plans to expand the range of products on offer. Malcolm Landau, director of European retailing and wholesaling at Littlewoods, says: 'In overall terms, sales and gross contribution per square foot are substantially better than in the UK. There is also much more rapid stock turnover and lower stock levels.' Landau adds that the product mix is increasingly moving towards locally-sourced merchandise. Significantly, the operating environment, though difficult, is improving - 'the most important change is the improving economic situation. Also, an increasing percentage of the population has a disposable income. 'I believe the long-term retailing opportunities are extremely good; the short- term outlook, however, must remain mixed as it is very difficult to predict the immediate economic and political situation.' Littlewoods eventual aim is larger stores, concentrating on the bigger urban conurbations - 'we hope to launch a full-scale chain store, probably in St Petersburg, during the next fifteen to eighteen months, if not sooner.' Karstadt, the German department store operator, has chosen a a different path, supplying internationally-sourced products to four niche stores - European-style fashion wear, children's clothes and toys, optics and sports gear and equipment - located within Moscow's long-established Gum department store. The stores, totalling around 2,000 square metres, are run and operated by Gum, but Karstadt provides know-how and financial assistance for store layout, decoration and general merchandising skills. To date, Karstadt has invested some DM3m in upgrading the four Gum-run stores. Peter Lang, finance director of Karstadt, observes: 'Sales last year totalled around DM30m. There has been a small increase in the first seven months of this year compared with the same period last year, with textiles and fashion goods generating the largest share.' The company, he adds, is happy in principle with the venture, but there are no immediate plans to expand the pilot venture.</p>

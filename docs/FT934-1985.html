			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Joint Statement on Ulster: Failed pacts litter Anglo-Irish affairs The tortuous path of Anglo-Irish relations is littered with failed agreements and misunderstandings. In three decades the two countries have been on the verge of deals a number of times only to see them founder on interpretation. The Anglo-Irish agreement, signed in November 1985, met intense unionist opposition. the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher, UK prime minister, entered into the agreement 'to defeat the men of violence and to bring peace and stability'. Dr Garret FitzGerald, her Irish counterpart, saw it as a way to end problems which the nationalist community felt had not been properly represented in the past. Moderate and hardline unionists believed the agreement betrayed their historic right to veto any deal by giving the Republic of Ireland a say in Northern Ireland affairs. Unionists had shown their muscle before when they rejected the Sunningdale power-sharing agreement in 1973. Hardliners interpreted it as a significant concession to the nationalist community. Renewed Westminster pledges over the next 12 years that Northern Ireland would remain in the UK so long as a majority in the province wished it were wrongly interpreted by unionists as a veto. The constitutional convention set up in 1975 by Mr Merlyn Rees, then secretary for Northern Ireland, was dismantled within months without being able to agree on any alternatives to direct rule. Efforts by Mr James Prior to set up an assembly foundered on the same rock. An attempt at forging a new understanding with the republic fell apart when Mrs Thatcher told parliament in 1982 there was no commitment to consult Dublin on matters relating to Northern Ireland. Yesterday's declaration depends on whether unionists interpret their right to stay in the UK as giving them a veto over the right of the majority in the UK - through the British prime minister - to make whatever agreement the government feels desirable.</p>

			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / World Trade News: UAE pushing through law on copyright The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is pushing through legislation to avoid being placed on a US 'priority watchlist' of countries breaching international copyright laws, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai. The UAE aimed to legislate a copyright and trade mark and patents protection law ahead of an announcement by the US trade representative's office, they added. In the UAE, which so far lacks laws to protect copyright and trade marks, US companies were losing 'millions' every year, the officials declared. Shops are crammed full of fake products, with some of the industry based in the UAE.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 31 (XINHUA) -- The reminiscences of  late Hu Qiaomu, who served as Mao Zedong's personal secretary  from 1941 to 1948, is shortly to be published here.    "Hu Qiaomu Recalls Mao Zedong", is being brought out by the  People's Publishing House.    Hu Qiaomu -- who was 29 when he began working as Mao's  secretary and secretary of the Communist Party's Politburo and  who went on to become an eminent party theorist and historian --  started writing the book in the early 1990s.    He died at the age of 81, after an illness, on September 28,  1992. The writing group which had been helping him to write the  book then divided its contents into two parts: "The Recorded  Talks" and "The Initial Drafts," and finished compiling the  volume.    "The Recorded Talks" part includes records of a dozen talks  by Hu Qiaomu on the subject, while the other part consists of 19  articles drafted by the writing group along lines requested by  Hu.    These talks and articles cover many important aspects of Mao  Zedong's thinking and activities in the 1940s.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / Construction Contracts: Regeneration of former power station property CONDER PROJECTS, a division of the Winchester-based Conder Group, has been appointed design and build contractor by The Harbour Club for a regeneration project in the heart of London which will transform part of the redundant Fulham power station site. Built in the 1930s and covering over 12 acres, the power station was decommissioned in the early 1980s and sold by the CEGB. Much of the land has been used since then for multi- storey apartments, underground car parks and retail outlets. The remaining 2.7 acres is to be transformed into The Harbour Club. Conder Projects offered a design solution, utilising the existing basement structure to construct 10 indoor and five outdoor tennis courts, a 30 metre swimming pool, restaurant, fitness gymnasium, exercise studios and a health and beauty suite on four floors within the original power station, main boiler house and turbine area. Total contract value to Conder Projects is Pounds 6m and completion is anticipated in December.</p>

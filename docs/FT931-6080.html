			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / Management: Down but certainly not out - As white-collar workers join the dole queue in growing numbers, FT writers look at ways of putting them back to work Geoff Annison, manager of St Albans JobCentre in Hertfordshire, has recently recruited a new team to market unemployed professionals, managers and executives to local companies. His JobCentre, serving what was once one of the busiest commuter towns in south-east England, estimates that 40 per cent of its claimants are professionals and executives. Last summer the figure was 30 per cent. An unprecedented increase in executive, management and professional unemployment has been one of the most eye-catching features of the present recession. A Department of Employment study of London and the south-east published last summer suggested 19 per cent of the unemployed had worked in professional or managerial occupations. Nationally the figure was estimated at just over 10 per cent. Levels have gone up since then. A growing number of organisations, in addition to self-help organisations, are trying to rise to the need. They include: JobCentres. Judging by the four jobs on offer at the St Albans JobCentre, professionals and executives are not a natural target group. However, with tough targets from the government to get their clients into jobs, JobCentres are focusing on executives. Annison, for example, has recruited seven new staff to service them. 'Most employers do not naturally think of advertising for executives in a JobCentre, so we are having actively to tell them about our clients,' he says. Training and Enterprise Councils. Several of the 82 Tecs in England and Wales are introducing imaginative new schemes, most of them built on Employment Training. This offers Pounds 10 per week on top of benefit and a placement with an employer. Vivien Houson, of Hitchin in Hertfordshire, is an enthusiastic participant. After a business grounding at Merrill Lynch she set up her own marketing and design company. It was forced to close last year after Houson had a serious accident. Unemployed, she was referred to a new executive programme, designed by Hertfordshire Tec on the ET model. Called Management Link it offers three weeks' general management training before placement with a local employer. Houson's skills were matched by Enterprise Partnership, the training organisation, with a structural engineering company which had a project that it had not been able to develop. Thirteen weeks later she was offered a full-time post - of managing director of a new division which will exploit a new product she has developed within the company. 'It was the matching that was so crucial and so successful,' says Houson. Individual consultancy. For an individual not receiving counselling as part of a severance package, it is possible to find a consultant from about Pounds 140 for a half day's session, according to the Institute of Personnel Management*. The two big dangers for individuals to avoid are wasting money on a cowboy consultant and wasting time approaching counsellors who are only interested in company assignments. The IPM's consultancy service will help callers with both these problems by checking those on its register, noting callers' requirements and providing suitable names of consultants. *IPM.

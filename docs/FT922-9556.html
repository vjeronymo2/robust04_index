			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Risk of corruption worries IFC WORLD Bank officials are concerned that the lack of legislation and regulation has exposed some emerging stock markets to the risk of scandal and corruption. Mr Peter Tropper, author of the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) emerging markets factbook, said yesterday: 'A stock market does not exist in a vacuum, it has to be part of the economy and has to be effectively regulated.' While declining to name offenders, Mr Tropper said that the IFC, part of the World Bank, was working with them to improve the situation. Looking back on 1991, Mr Tropper noted that the Gulf war had brought many regional funds to a discount to their net asset value. The IFC's 1992 Emerging Stock Markets Factbook is available from 1818, H Street, NW, Washington, DC, 20433 USA, priced at Dollars 60.</p>

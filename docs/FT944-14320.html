			<p>941024 FT  24 OCT 94 / Survey of Zambia (3): Yields have done wonders for growth - The banking sector If the proliferation in the number of banks is a reliable guide, the old adage that banks prosper when the rest of the economy is in trouble, is borne out by Zambian experience. There are now some 30 licensed banks, although only about 20 are effectively operational, compared with just six five years ago. On the surface, hyperinflation and astronomical nominal interest rates and Treasury bill yields have done wonders for the growth of the financial sector. The reality is different. The banks are saddled with high ratios of non-performing loans, especially in agriculture, while the newer players, in the words of a private sector economist, 'born and bred on the TB market' lack the professional skill and expertise to appraise loans and make sound credit decisions. A core problem for the sector is the failure, as yet, to increase bank capitalisation ratios. 'A bank can open its door on what it would cost to buy a Toyota Landcruiser' says one banker, which means that the new, small players could be in trouble when - rather than if - they are hit by a significant external setback such as sudden kwacha depreciation or the failure of a significant borrower. According to one bank: 'It's a disaster waiting to happen' - a comment justified by the practice of one small bank which is offering kwacha interest rates on US dollar deposits. All very well while TB yields were high and the kwacha stable, but that game seems to be nearing its end. The Bank of Zambia is watching the situation closely. Legislation to raise bank capital requirements has gone through parliament and will come into effect soon. In the meantime, officials point out that with 80 per cent or so of bank transactions in the hands of a handful of players with strong international connections - such as Barclays, Standard Chartered and Stanbic  -the probable shake-out in the industry, in the form of mergers and closures, is unlikely to destabilise it. For the immediate future, bank lending will be constrained, not just by the fragile state of many corporate balance sheets, but also by high statutory reserve and liquid asset ratios. The 29 per cent reserve ratio imposes a sizeable wedge between the rates at which banks can profitably take deposits and make loans, while the 35 per cent liquidity ratio has helped sustain profitability at a time of record TB yields. Both ratios will come down and the liquid assets ratio (which is non-binding anyway) will go altogether soon, paving the way for increased lending to the private sector as credit demand recovers. Commercial agriculture remains a highly problematic area with the banks being forced to reschedule loans to farmers hit by drought, rampant inflation and interest rates and the chaotic liberalisation of the marketing system. But private sector lending, lower in real terms today than a year ago, can recover only if the authorities maintain their tight grip on public sector borrowing. One statistic above all others highlights the success of Zambia's stabilisation programme - the decline in inflation from 187 per cent during 1993 to a forecast 30 per cent this year. Fiscal policy, especially the imposition of 'hard' cash budgets on government departments, and a tight monetary stance have been the key instruments. Some, especially in the business and farming communities, ask whether the cure might not turn out to have been more deadly than the disease. But private sector criticism of monetary policy has quietened with the recent dramatic fall in interest rates - down to an average of 43 per cent early this month from almost 100 per cent in February - a stable exchange rate, and inflation of les than 1 per cent monthly. Indeed, prime rates of the main banks had fallen to the mid-30s. Fiscal discipline has been the most important single component since without it monetary policy could not have been used so effectively to slow inflation and stabilise the kwacha. The government is on target to reach its budget forecast of a broad fiscal balance (a deficit of K11bn) thanks to the combination of cash budgeting on one hand and improved revenue inflows, following the creation of the independent Zambia Revenue Authority, headed by four expatriates and funded by the UK Ministry of Overseas Development. In the first eight months of this year, the government achieved a primary budget surplus - that is domestic revenue less non-interest payments - of some K44bn, enabling it to keep the lid on domestic credit creation. Money supply growth slowed from 114 per cent in November 1993 to 42 per cent in August this year, reflecting a decline in net government borrowing and a marked slow-down in private sector lending, despite the availability of cheaper money. By September, the year-on-year inflation rate for September had declined to 29 per cent from 138 per cent at the end of 1993. The compounded annual yield on 91-day Treasury Bills, which hit a high of 205 per cent in May had fallen below 60 per cent by September, while the tender rate dropped 13 points in a fortnight to 29 per cent in mid- October. All of which points first to a revival in private sector credit demand over the next year, a flattening out of TB yields in the 15-20 per cent range and  -very likely - an exchange rate shake-out as investors, both Zambian and foreign, look offshore for more attractive returns. Most of the foreign players have already quit the TB market. Three months ago about 15 per cent of the Dollars 200m stock was held by foreigners, but this is now done to 1 or 2 per cent as the markets anticipate kwacha depreciation following the effective appreciation of the exchange rate during 1994. With the reserves up to Dollars 330m - equivalent to three months' import cover at 1992 levels - from Dollars 186m a year ago, limited capacity exists to absorb any surge in imports and capital outflows, but the central bank is not in the business of fixing exchange rates, acknowledging that real exchange rate appreciation will constrain the development of non-copper exports that is so crucial to the next stage of the adjustment programme. With import demand relatively slack, and buoyant copper prices, the balance of payments position ought to have improved in 1994 from the Dollars 110m current account deficit last year. However ZCCM has been unable to exploit this; output will be down this year and delayed deliveries to meet sales contracts at lower prices is undercutting export revenues. With no early solution to the ZCCM crisis in sight, policy must focus on developing non-traditional exports on the one hand, while securing further debt relief on the other. The debt burden is down from more than 275 per cent of GDP to an estimated 200 per cent at present (about Dollars 6bn). The 1995 Paris Club negotiations could reduce this by up to a third - to some Dollars 4bn - which, with the completion of the IMF Rights programme and access to Esaf funds by mid-1995, will transform the external payments situation from one that was totally unmanageable three years ago.</p>

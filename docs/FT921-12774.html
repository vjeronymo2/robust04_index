			<p>920124 FT  24 JAN 92 / North Korea pleased with New York talks NORTH Korea said yesterday that its highest-level contacts with the US since the Korean War had been satisfactory and were held in an 'open-minded' atmosphere, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The official Korean Central News Agency said the two sides had discussed the issue of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula in their meeting in New York on Wednesday. It said they had also discussed improved ties between Pyongyang and Washington and other matters of common concern. The meeting - the highest-level one since the Korean War ended in 1953  - was between the US under secretary of state for political affairs, Mr Arnold Kanter, and the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, Mr Richard Solomon, and a delegation led by Mr Kim Young Sun, the ruling Communist party's secretary for international relations.</p>

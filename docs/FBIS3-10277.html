I do not believe in the alliance between  Arnoldo Aleman and Steadman Fagoth. Fagoth is unstable, has  been going from one extreme to the other, Rivera stated this  afternoon at the Supreme Electoral Council office in Metrocentro.    Had we not participated in the vote-counting process on the  Atlantic Coast, we would have given the impression of being  incompetent. Leading troops is not the same as being political  leaders and presenting a political platform. We are not  thinking of any political agreements before 1996, Nicaraguan  Resistance [RN] Commanders Jose and Johnson have stated.    The Liberal Constitutionalist Party, PLC, is anticipated to  be the election winners in the upper and central region and  lower valley of Rio Coco, as well as in Siuna sectors one, two,  and three. The PLC is expected to follow a similar trend in  Halban, Pancazan, and Nueva York neighborhoods in the city of  Bluefields. Dr. Mariano Fiallos Oyanguren, Supreme Electoral  Council president made the previous statement at a news  conference held a few moments ago.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's long voyage THE CHANCELLOR of the exchequer is convinced that there is no better alternative than the policies now being pursued by the British government. What is certain is that there is no alternative for this government but to pursue these policies. Mr John Major has run the flag of the ERM to the top of his government's mast and there it must stay, unless blown away by the economic storms. Mr Lamont talked enticingly in yesterday's speech to the European Policy Forum of the safe harbour that the UK is set to reach. 'Under Margaret Thatcher,' he argued, 'the 1980s saw huge improvements in the performance of the supply side of the the British economy . . . But the unfinished business of the 1980s was inflation. If we can only combine this dynamic supply-side performance with an environment of permanently low inflation, we can build a truly world-class economy . . . in the 1990s and beyond.' The voyage will be longer and harder than the chancellor had earlier suggested. But the reduction in retail price inflation, excluding mortgage interest relief, to 4.8 per cent in the year to June 1992 is an achievement. Annual pay settlements are also running at 4 per cent. If the present squeeze continues - and everything suggests it will - underlying inflation may well fall to 2 per cent in the next couple of years. Albeit welcome, lower inflation will not necessarily bring recovery nearer. In the debt-laden housing market, the prospect of negligible house price inflation means that those with negative equity will have to save to cover the shortfall. In a highly indebted economy like the UK today, prospects for recovery depend heavily on the level of real interest rates. But unless nominal interest rates fall pari passu, lower inflation will raise real interest rates. Ineffectual summit Nominal interest rates will not fall soon. What matters most of all is the level of German interest rates, on which the news looks bad. The British economic vessel is, in fact, voyaging between the Scylla of German monetary overshooting and the Charybdis of US dollar depreciation. The extent of the policy divergence was merely underlined at this week's ineffectual summit of the group of seven industrial countries. The dollar has fallen from DM1.67 in mid-April to DM1.50 yesterday, which is not far from its all-time low of DM1.45. This decline reflects not only the yield gap between German and US short-term interest rates, which is at the unprecedented level of six and a half percentage points, but also the negligible prospect of early US monetary tightening. Dollar weakness directly undermines UK competitiveness, with overall sterling appreciation of a little under 1 per cent since mid-April. More importantly, it influences the pound's position within the ERM. Sterling's exchange rate against the D-Mark has fallen to DM2.8725 from DM2.945 in early May. This puts it outside its narrow band limits, to which yet again the chancellor has committed the government. Uncomfortable position Unhappily, dollar weakness is not the only misery the UK economy has to endure. The Bundesbank is about to reset its monetary targets next week, at a time when German monetary overshooting persists. It finds itself in a most uncomfortable position: if it tightens monetary policy, it will face uproar in Europe; if it does not tighten monetary policy, the credibility of its monetary targets will be undermined. In this particular contest, it would be far safer to bet on monetary tightening, though perhaps in a slightly disguised form. With such ill economic weather, the chancellor can do little more than offer the hope of a safe arrival in the promised harbour. But he also rejects all alternative routes. On many points, he is unquestionably correct: the UK cannot hope to enjoy significantly lower interest rates than Germany within the ERM; a German realignment against other ERM currencies does not look at all likely; a sterling devaluation within the ERM is far more likely to raise UK interest rates than lower them; and simply leaving the ERM is bound to be seen as yet another British flight into the inflationary never never land. The only serious alternative would be to leave the ERM while establishing strong domestic institutional arrangements, including an independent central bank, to achieve the goal of non-inflationary growth. This is theoretically possible. There is no a priori reason why what New Zealand has managed is impossible for the UK. Nor is it inconceivable that British interest rates would be below the German: by now the interest rates of most developed economies whose currencies are not directly linked to the D-Mark are below the German level. Nevertheless, any such move would destroy this government's economic policy, its European policy and quite possibly the government itself. The chancellor is bound to remain on his present course for the foreseeable future. But the international weather is getting very rough. The passengers must hope to escape sea sickness or, worse, drowning.</p>

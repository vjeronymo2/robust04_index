			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / The FT Interview: Self-reliant streak to jack of all trades When Mr John Jackson was a schoolboy, one of his teachers said to him: 'Jackson, if you're not careful, you'll become an absolutely useless dilettante.' Mr Jackson, 64, who became chairman of Ladbroke at the beginning of this year, sternly denies any charges of dilettantism. Whether studying plants, butterflies, walking in the Himalayas or running companies, he insists that each task gets his full attention. Nevertheless, as the chairman of seven quoted groups and London solicitors Mishcon de Reya, the director of several other companies, and part owner of the magazine History Today, he is open to the charge that he cannot possibly master them all. Mr Jackson is part of a small group of UK businessmen who have become professional chairmen and non-executive directors. After 28 years with the British subsidiary of Philips, the Dutch electronics group, he realised he would rise no higher than the UK board and decided to look for non-executive appointments. Philips gave him an office, a secretary and a parking space. His current chairmanships include: Graseby, the electronics group; Celltech, the biotechnology company; Howden, the engineering group; Brown &amp; Jackson, owner of the Poundstretcher discount retail chain; Wyndeham Press, a printing and packaging company; and the computer services concern, SD-Scicon. He is also a director of marketing services group WPP, among others. By his own admission, chairing a company is a full-time job. He says: 'A chairman is neither executive or non-executive. He's a chairman 24 hours a day.' How can all his companies get 24 hours a day? By managing his time rigorously, he can ensure that each company gets sufficient attention, he insists. Mr Philip Swinstead, founder of SD-Scicon, says: 'He has this fantastic ability to compartmentalise his mind and switch with each telephone call to another compartment.' As to Mr Jackson being useless, shareholders in Ladbroke - whose interests include betting shops, Hilton International hotels and the Texas Homecare do-it-yourself chain - currently think otherwise. Mr Jackson earlier this month achieved what many despairing Ladbroke observers had considered impossible: he persuaded Mr Cyril Stein, head of the company for nearly four decades, to step down from the board. While few dispute Mr Stein's role in building up Ladbroke from a small high-society betting agent to its current status as an employer of 53,000 people, many had tired of the group's secretiveness. One analyst recalls a results presentation when Mr Stein accepted three questions and then led the board out of the room. Last September, Ladbroke said Mr Stein would step down as chairman at the end of 1993 but would remain a non-executive director for three years. Mr Jackson, then vice-chairman, would become chairman. Almost immediately, it became clear the arrangement would not work. Mr Stein, who was ill when Mr Jackson announced the change, telephoned the FT from his sick bed to say he would still play a leading role in the group's decision-making. There was similar confusion over who was in charge late last year when Ladbroke made contradictory announcements about whether it would take advantage of the new foreign income dividend scheme. Unlike conventional dividends, foreign income dividends do not carry a tax credit which pension fund investors can claim. Pension fund shareholders' annoyance caused the share price to fall. Mr Jackson does not regret the original plan for Mr Stein to remain on the board. He says: 'I thought it could work. I knew Cyril as being a man of very strong character who was capable of disciplining himself. What I didn't know was whether he would or whether the outside world would give him a chance to. 'The outside world can make life difficult for someone trying to cope with a situation of this kind. It's not malice or wickedness. I think well-meaning people said things to Cyril that made life difficult for him. There were people who made remarks like: 'What are you going to do now, Cyril?' ' How did Mr Jackson persuade Mr Stein to give up his non-executive post on the board as well as the chairmanship? Mr Swinstead says he can guess how Mr Jackson persuaded Mr Stein to go: 'I've seen him take tough decisions. I've seen him turn around to someone and say: 'This isn't working. I'm upset, you're upset.' With a smile on his face.' In dealing with Mr Stein, Mr Swinstead thinks, 'John will have worked away, he will have gone on and on until eventually the unassailable logic of the situation will have got through'. Is that how it happened? Mr Jackson says it became clear in the last months of 1993 that Mr Stein was going to find it painful not to have the last word. 'A great deal of harm might have been done to the company and to him. It wasn't difficult to come to the conclusion that there should be a clean break.' He adds: 'Many people who have created great companies find it difficult to distinguish between themselves and the company.' Mr Jackson could not be more different. A constant theme of his conversation is an obsession with self-sufficiency, with not being indissolubly linked with a particular company. For example, at Mishcon de Reya, where he has his office, he insists on paying rent. He traces his interest in self-reliance back to his father's unemployment. Before Mr Jackson was born, his father had worked in Mozambique on a cotton-planting scheme and had come down with blackwater fever. 'He and my mother and my brother and I lived in the (English) West Country in a fisherman's house. We survived by taking in lodgers and living off the sea and allotments. It taught me a hell of a lot about looking after myself,' he says. 'That view of life was reinforced during the second world war. It showed me how you could be self-reliant and live with other people in a community. One of the great effects of the war was that it brought people together.' In the 1970s, he devised an exercise in self-sufficiency for his own family: for six years, on borrowed land in Kent, the Jacksons produced their own meat, milk, eggs, vegetables and some fruit. They produced a surplus, which they sold to old age pensioners at reduced prices. Self-sufficiency cuts both ways. He believes companies need to know when to tell the chairman to go. 'The chairman must be the one member of the board sackable at one second's notice. If he's not doing his job properly, his colleagues should get rid of him.' So far, Mr Jackson has been given credit for making Ladbroke more approachable. When, with Mr Stein ill in bed, Mr Jackson announced the group's half-year results last September, analysts recall that he asked one of them whether he was happy with an answer a director had given him. The analyst said he wasn't. Mr Jackson asked the director for more details. It is a sign of the suspicion in which Ladbroke had been held that this was seen as the beginning of a new dawn. Mr Jackson says the group intends to dispose of its substantial property portfolio, a particular interest of Mr Stein. The group is also considering changing its name. When the Texas chain is more profitable, the group will decide whether it should be retained or sold. Ladbroke's board will have to decide whether to cut its dividend, a move resisted by Mr Stein but regarded by the City as an essential token of the group's prudence and realism. The City has long feared that Ladbroke's reticence concealed a dark accounting secret. That suspicion is starting to fade. Mr Jackson now needs to dispel it entirely.</p>

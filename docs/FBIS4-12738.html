			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 13 Apr (INA)--The newspaper AL-THAWRAH  affirms that the intense momentum in the number of visits to  Baghdad by Western businessmen and trade firms is highly  significant, and shows that the embargo clamped on Iraq is  almost over.    In an article today, AL-THAWRAH, which speaks for the Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party, adds that these Western parties hope to  conclude business contracts and economic agreements with Iraq  pending a lifting of the sanctions so as to resume their  transactions with Iraq.    The paper notes the many offers Iraq has received from  Western companies, including French, Italian, Greek, and Turkish  corporations. The paper adds that the business community in  Washington and London has not failed to express hope that it  will not be denied a share in this competition. It made its  position in this regard quite clear in its recent meeting with  an Iraqi delegation in New York, a meeting that was held there  at its own request.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that the strong competition among  Western  firms and corporations to curry favor with Iraq, and win  cooperation contracts with it demonstrates that Iraq has emerged  from the bottleneck, and efficiently shown its endurance and  perseverance. This also shows that Iraq is an indispensable,  important, and key regional player in terms of economy--with  which cooperation is essential.    AL-THAWRAH also notes the impact of the embargo on the  domestic front, saying that the past few years have underscored  the excellence and superiority of Iraqi expertise, as manifested  in its inventive and creative accomplishments within the context  of the national reconstruction drive to rebuild what was  destroyed in record time. This has rendered Iraqi expertise a  strong competitor.    The paper also notes the embargo Washington has been  enforcing to weaken and exhaust the Iraqis. But thanks to the  wisdom of the leadership and the awareness of our people, the  embargo has turned into a factor of attrition detrimental to  others. Instead of becoming a heavy load on our chest, the  embargo has burdened many European businesses which have not  hidden their bitterness over U.S. deception and Washington's  obtaining the lion share. These businesses were also embittered  by Washington's frenzied efforts to obtain the traditional  European shares in the Middle East markets. In this regard, the  paper notes France's loss of an airbus deal with Saudi Arabia,  the deal Washington has won.    AL-THAWRAH sheds light on the serious harm inflicted on  Western interests in the region as a result of their resignation  to the U.S. deception and intimidation campaign, saying that the  most obvious result of this has been the bankruptcy of some  4,000 Turkish companies over the past two years due to the Iraq  embargo, not to mention that hundreds of West European and East  European firms have laid off many of their workers and employees  and been forced to shut down for the same reason.    To corroborate its argument, the paper cites statements  recently made by a senior official of the Greek Ports  Corporation that the halt in trade activities with Iraq has  seriously affected the economy of his country. He added that  the harm done to Greek ports due to the embargo is  understandably equal to the financial revenues Greece has lost.  The embargo is also responsible for increasing unemployment  rates. The Greek official expressed hope that the anti-Iraq  embargo will be lifted so that his country may reactivate its  trade and business links with Iraq.    Regarding the impact of the Iraq embargo on the Arab scene,  the paper cites a report issued by the Arab Labor Organization  last week. This report stated that the number of unemployed in  the Arab states has risen to 5 million due to the severance of  trade ties with Iraq.</p>

			<p><P> December 29, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA TOURNAMENT;  </P> <P> FAY'S LONG-RANGE MARKSMANSHIP GIVES BUENA 92-84 OVERTIME WIN  </P> <P> Lompoc High did everything a team with a two-point lead is supposed to do in  the last minute of a game, yet the Braves won't be playing for the championship  of the Ventura tournament tonight.  </P> <P> Lompoc made all eight of its free throws in the last 51 seconds of the fourth  quarter in Friday night's semifinal against Buena, but the Braves couldn't stop  Bulldog guard Lance Fay, who hit three consecutive three-point shots in the  last 21 seconds to send the game into overtime, in which Buena prevailed,  92-84. The Bulldogs will play Thousand Oaks for the title.  </P> <P> Fay's final missile came at the buzzer and tied the score, 80-80.  </P> <P> His first one narrowed Buena's deficit to 76-74 with 21 seconds left and his  second cut Lompoc's lead to 78-77 with four seconds remaining.  </P> <P> After forward Jeff Dubowsky's two free throws gave Lompoc (6-5) an 80-77 lead  with three seconds left, Buena (6-3) got the ball to Fay, who swished an  off-balance shot from 21 feet as the buzzer sounded.  </P> <P> Fay scored a game-high 31 points, 25 after intermission.  </P> <P> Dubowsky, who scored a team-high 29 points for Lompoc, fouled out with 1:24  remaining in the extra period. With him out of the game, Buena was able to  concentrate on shutting down Scott Morgan.  </P> <P> Morgan, a 6-foot-5 senior center, was held scoreless in overtime after scoring  28 points in regulation.  </P> <P> In other games:  </P> <P> Thousand Oaks 84, Camarillo 78 -- Chris Loll matched the tournament record with  a career-high 40 points for the Lancers (8-1) in the semifinals. Loll, who also  had 16 rebounds, scored 16 points in the fourth quarter, hitting six of six  from the field and four of four from the foul line. The 6-foot-6 forward made  14 of 23 field-goal attempts in the game.  </P> <P> David Harbour of Camarillo (5-2) scored 32 points but was only nine of 16 from  the foul line.  </P> <P> Ventura 94, Nordhoff 61 -- Randy Martinez scored a game-high 25 points and Jon  Seiler added 20 for Ventura (4-4).

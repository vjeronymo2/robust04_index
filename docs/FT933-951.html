			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / New Ulster constitution planned: Anglo-Irish working party to draft an outline settlement for Northern Ireland THE BRITISH and Irish governments are seeking to draft a new constitutional settlement for Northern Ireland in a last-ditch attempt to revive stalled talks on the political future of the province. Sir Patrick Mayhew, the Northern Ireland secretary, and Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, have asked a joint working party of civil servants to present the draft by the end of October. Their decision, agreed privately at this month's meeting of the Anglo-Irish conference, reflects the growing view in London that the two governments have only a narrow window of opportunity to restart the political process. But there was uncertainty last night over whether the weekend initiative by Mr John Hume, the SDLP leader, and Mr Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, would hinder the process. The initiative was greeted by some in Ireland as offering the best prospects for peace in more than 20 years. The SDLP and Sinn Fein, in a joint report to be delivered to the US and Irish governments, have proposed appointing a US mediator to break the political impasse in Northern Ireland. Mr John Major, the prime minister, was given an outline of the proposals by Mr Hume two weeks ago in London. Mr Hume made it clear he wanted to break out of the present framework for negotiations. But Sir Patrick insists there can be no negotiations with Sinn Fein until it unequivocally renounces violence. At the heart of the settlement under discussion between London and Dublin would be a commitment by the republic to replace its constitutional claim to jurisdiction over Ulster with an 'aspiration' to achieve a united Ireland. London would acknowledge in return that if ever a majority in the province favoured re-unification then it would respect that view and pass the necessary legislation. It would also agree to a significant extension of cross-border co-operation involving the creation of joint executive boards in such areas as transport, tourism and relations with the European Community. The aim of the draft is to create an 'umbrella' under which the Protestant and Catholic political parties in the province could be persuaded to resume the round-table talks on internal political arrangements which broke down last year. In parallel, Mr Michael Ancram, the Northern Ireland minister responsible for political affairs, is engaged in an intensive round of contacts with the Unionists and with the mainly Catholic SDLP. Sir Patrick is said to be 'hopeful' rather than optimistic that the approach will succeed. He has been encouraged, however, by a number of recent developments, including the decision by Mr Ian Paisley, the leader of the Democratic Unionists, to table his own proposals for a political settlement. There is a growing feeling in London that Mr Paisley fears he could be outflanked by the official Ulster Unionists, led by Mr James Molyneaux. There is a growing view among many senior ministers that the next few months could offer the last chance of a settlement during the lifetime of the present parliament. By January the parties in the province will be launching their campaigns for the local and European elections. Mr Hume and Mr Adams have been involved in bilateral talks since last April. In a weekend statement they said: 'We are convinced from our discussions that a process can be designed to lead to agreement among the divided people of this island, which will provide a solid basis for peace. Such a process would obviously also be designed to ensure that any new agreement that might emerge respects the diversity of our different traditions and earns their allegiance and agreement'. A spokesman for the SDLP said the joint proposals meant Sinn Fein was effectively a partner in the negotiations. Unionist leaders last night urged the British government to reject Sinn Fein's claims to be a party in the talks. Sinn Fein enters peace process, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Moldovan police held a cargo with a radioactive  substance from Russia Tuesday [22 June]. Officials in the  Interior Ministry's organized crime department told INTERFAX  that one Russian and two Moldovan citizens had been apprehended  as they tried to smuggle a radioactive substance into Moldova  and sell it for $20,000.    The officials said that gamma-cobalt-60 had been obtained  and  put into a container in Russia and that the weight of the cargo  and its destination were being determined.    This is the first time the Moldovan police have found  material of this high quality and packed so thoroughly. A small  radioactive leak was detected that could be hazardous.    Experts from the Moldovan Academy of Sciences are trying to  determine to what use the cobalt was to be put.    The officials also said that a Romanian citizen is suspected  of being the customer who had ordered the cargo but there was  insufficient evidence for his arrest.</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: NO LAUGHING MATTER  </P> <P> Is Ed O'Neill married . . . with an image problem?  </P> <P> Known for his role as beleaguered hubby/father Al Bundy on Fox Broadcasting's  "Married . . . With Children," O'Neill -- a dramatic actor prior to the series  -- recently got laughed right out of Paramount's Vietnam action-adventure,  "Flight of the Intruder."  </P> <P> Because test screening audiences laughed when a serious O'Neill appeared as the  prosecutor in a military trial, O'Neill's scene has been snipped. The role has  been recast with actor Fred Dalton Thompson, according to a source close to the  production.  </P> <P> "I don't feel good about what happened," says O'Neill. "As an actor, it's kind  of frightening. It shows what TV can do to you. At the same time, I can't  complain about what the series has given me. It's a double-edged sword.  </P> <P> "What I don't want is for these producers in town to think they can't use me in  serious films -- especially since all I did before this ("Married") was  serious."  </P> <P> A longtime friend of director John Milius, O'Neill did two days work on the  film -- which was to be unbilled.  </P> <P> "My scene comes an hour or so into the picture. There's no introduction to my  character -- I come from out of nowhere. Suddenly there I am, in a uniform,  walking around this table at a court martial. I think that, to audiences who  aren't expecting me, it's as if Al Bundy's suddenly appeared. It's like Al  Bundy Joins the Army."  </P> <P> If anyone wants to see O'Neill, the dramatic actor, they can watch the ABC-TV  movie "The Whereabouts of Jenny," to air this fall. O'Neill portrays a father  separated from his daughter by a witness relocation program.  </P> <P> "The whole film is serious," promises O'Neill. "There's nothing to laugh at."  Pat H.

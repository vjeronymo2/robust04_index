			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the Board has had occasion to observe, however, 43 CFR 4.1105 does not name the permittee of the operation that is the subject of a determination of the Director or an authorized representative, or any person whose interests might be adversely affected by the outcome on appeal and who participated before OSM, as a party who must be served with a copy of the notice of appeal and statement of reasons under 43 CFR 4.1283(a) and who may participate under &sect;&sect;4.1284 and 4.1286. See Save Our Cumberland Mountains, Inc., 108 IBLA 70, 83 n.7, 96 I.D. 139, 146 n.7 (1989). OHA therefore proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1105(a) by adding subsection (5) naming such permittees and persons as parties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After this addition to 43 CFR 4.1105(a) was proposed, however, the Board decided Robert L. Clewell, 123 IBLA 253 (1992). In that case, citizens who had requested their identity be kept confidential, in accordance with 30 CFR 842.12(b), later revealed their identity to the coal company whose operation they had requested be inspected by sending a copy of their statement of reasons of appealing the denial of their request for inspection to the company. Had they not done so, under the terms of &sect;842.12(b), their ``identity may not be revealed, even to other parties to a case, unless and until a competent official acting in response to a formal request filed under 5 U.S.C. 552 (1988) or other Federal law has determined that [their] identity must be made public because it does not fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(7) (1988) or any other exemption from disclosure provided by law. See 42 FR 62665&hyph;66 (Dec. 13, 1977).'' Robert L. Clewell,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at 257 n.1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of this decision, OHA has added a statement to the new &sect;4.1105(a)(5) that a person who wishes his or her identity kept confidential under 30 CFR 842.12(b) is responsible for maintaining that confidentiality when serving documents in accordance with &sect;4.1109. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1109(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 4.1109(a) is amended to update field solicitor office telephone number to reflect changes which have been effected heretofore. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1151(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSM amended 30 CFR 723.19(a) and 845.19(a) to provide 30 days rather than 15 days in which a person may file a petition for review of a proposed civil penalty with the Hearings Division of OHA after the date of service of notice of an assessment conference officer's action. See 56 FR 10060, 10063 (Mar. 8, 1991). OHA therefore proposed to amend the corresponding procedural rule, 43 CFR 4.1151(b), to provide the same time and to add a reference to 30 CFR 845.18. No comments were received on the proposed change, so it is adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendments of 43 CFR 4.1152, 4.1154, and 4.1157 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The references to 30 CFR part 723 in 43 CFR 4.1152(a)(2); to 30 CFR 723.15 in 43 CFR 4.1154(a); and to 30 CFR 723.12 and 723.13 in 43 CFR 4.1157 (a) and (b) need to be updated by correcting the references in 43 CFR 4.1154(a) and in 43 CFR 4.1157 (a) and (b) and by adding references to the corresponding sections in 30 CFR part 845. OHA proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1152, 4.1154, and 4.1157 for this purpose. No comments on these proposed changes were received, so they are adopted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1266(b)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 43 CFR 4.1266(b)(2) is amended to update OSM field office telephone numbers to reflect changes which have been effected heretofore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1271(a) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> When 43 CFR part 4, subpart L was originally promulgated in 1978, 43 CFR 4.1271(a) provided that an aggrieved party could file a ``notice of appeal'' from an order or decision of an administrative law judge disposing of a proceeding ``under this subpart, except a civil penalty proceeding under &sect;4.1150.'' This is still the language of the rule. Since 1978, however, other rules have been added to subpart L that provide for a ``petition for discretionary review,'' rather than a notice of appeal, as the document to file with IBLA when seeking review of the initial decision of an administrative law judge. See 43 CFR 4.1309, 4.1369 (56 FR 2139, 2144, Jan. 22, 1991; 56 FR 5061, Feb. 7, 1991). OHA has also proposed rules that provide for petitions for discretionary review. See 43 CFR 4.1377, 4.1387 (56 FR 45806, Sept. 6, 1991). Further, special procedures for seeking IBLA review exist for other proceedings in subpart L. See 43 CFR 4.1187, 4.1196, 4.1391. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although it is possible for IBLA to clarify by decision which avenue of appeal is appropriate for each proceeding, see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The Hopi Tribe  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Office of Surface Mining Reclamation &amp; Enforcement <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 107 IBLA 329 (1989), it is preferable for the procedural rules themselves to contain this information. OHA therefore proposed to amend 43 CFR 4.1271(a) so that the rule will specify for which proceedings a notice of appeal is appropriate. No comments on the proposed change were received, so it is adopted. Proceedings not covered by the procedural rules set forth in the revised &sect;4.1271(a) contain special provisions for seeking review of initial decisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

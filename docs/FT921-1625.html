			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Portuguese inflation and trade figures better than expected PORTUGAL'S trade and inflation performance is improving more quickly than previously forecast, according to Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, the central bank governor. The trade balance improved sharply in January and inflation has been slowing since the beginning of the year, according to recent figures which officials argue show the economy is performing better than expected. At the end of February, average annualised inflation was down from 11.4 per cent for the whole of 1991 to 10.2 per cent. The trade deficit fell by almost 40 per cent in January as a result of a surge in exports, which grew by 17.4 per cent compared with January 1991. Mr Moreira told the Financial Times that improvement on both fronts demonstrated the economy was performing much better than was forecast by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its annual report on Portugal published last month. 'The trend is positive, and the (economic) convergence process (with the richer European Community states) is clearly moving ahead,' he said. 'At 0.2 per cent the inflation rate is already 0.3 percentage points below the OECD's forecast of 10.5 per cent for the whole of 1992. If the current trend continues, the target of 8.5 per cent inflation is very much within reach.' He said price increases should slow further in March, though new value added tax rates coming into force in April could temporarily reverse the trend. The results demonstrated the correctness of the current tight monetary and foreign exchange policies, he said. 'The dramatic improvement in the trade balance shows that the exchange rate policy (to maintain a strong escudo) is not as serious a constraint on industry as has been argued,' he added. He said there were no special reasons for January's strong export performance. Trade with Portugal's major partners such as Spain showed a similar pattern.</p>

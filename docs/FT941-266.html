			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Investment in India (9): The path becomes smoother  -Arun Singh explains the legal framework for foreign companies It is now much easier for foreign investors to establish operations in India, but there remain many regulations which have to be followed. Since liberalisation in July 1991 regulations have been streamlined and foreign companies have been actively encouraged to enter the Indian market. Foreign companies are advised, nevertheless, to seek specialist advice from the outset as to the legal form of collaboration, the market and taxation. Broadly speaking, approval must be sought and while there is an automatic process for this, it is only given if certain guidelines are met, such as a set sum for payment for technology and royalties. Foreign investors, too, are obliged under the regulations to enter into collaboration with a local company or individual. Generally, there are four main routes for pursuing business opportunities in India, each route involving varying degrees of commercial risk. Foreign companies may initially wish to appoint an Indian agent to market and sell their goods in India and act as their local representative. Under the new business environment this has become an increasingly attractive route, particularly in view of the reduction of import controls. It is a useful and effective method for developing sales contacts generally and for targeting industries in the public or private sector. In view of the geography of India, foreign companies often appoint a number of agents who have the necessary knowledge or contacts in specific states or towns. Secondly, foreign companies may, in the place of (or in addition to) agents, open liaison offices in India to explore the market potential and familiarise themselves with the Indian business environment. Government approval has to be obtained to open a liaison office but it is a straightforward and speedy process. Thirdly, if foreign companies wish to undertake activities beyond those permitted for liaison offices, they have to open a branch office in India. The branch office would be connected to the business activities of the foreign parent company, and can execute contracts. There are specific rules for obtaining permission to open liaison and branch offices which should be complied with, but if they are, the Reserve Bank of India will grant permission within a matter of weeks, rather than months, as in the past. Other options relate to the transfer of technology, and to the setting up of a fully-fledged joint venture. Technology Transfer: Where a foreign company wishes to transfer technology to an Indian company - generally through licensing - automatic permission will be given, provided the application meets certain guidelines, namely the technology payment, which is for the transfer of technology and is not beyond Rs10m (some Pounds 220,000). Royalties are 5 per cent for domestic sales and 8 per cent for export sales. Lump sum payments and royalties may be paid for up to a period of 10 years from the date of the agreement. Joint Ventures: Foreign companies seeking to have a more permanent presence in India can consider a joint venture to manufacture or they may establish a wholly-owned subsidiary. Until July 1991, the maximum equity that a foreign company could have in a joint venture in India was 40 per cent but the limit on foreign equity holdings has now been increased to up to 51 per cent in 35 high priority industries. These include electrical equipment, boilers and steam generating equipment, agricultural and industrial machinery, chemicals, food processing, and computer software. If the foreign investor's project does not come within the 35 high priority industries, or if they require a greater amount of foreign equity, or specific infrastructural projects, such as BOT/BOOs, (build  operate-transfer/build-own-operate) they may make an application to the Foreign Investment Promotion Board, in the Indian Prime Minister's office, which considers each application on its merit. If there is a transfer of proprietary information, there are intellectual property rights and trade mark protection available to the foreign investor. As well as making provisions for the protection of intellectual property rights within any collaboration agreement, it is important to stipulate an agreement regarding the governing law applying to the contract, and how any dispute is to be resolved. This might be through High Court litigation, arbitration, or some form of alternative dispute resolution. Indian law permits agreements to provide for disputes to be resolved in what is normally considered a neutral forum, such as the International Chamber of Commerce. Any arbitration agreement or clause should be carefully drafted with a view to easing enforcement of arbitration awards. An Indian Supreme Court decision not so long ago delivered a judgment which could have a serious impact on the enforceability of shareholders agreements and international arbitration awards, and investors would be advised to check the applicability of these judgments with regard to their transactions. In summary, before deciding to go ahead companies should: check Indian Government regulations and comply with them. While there has been liberalisation, specific regulations apply to foreign investors; be clear as to the method of payment, commission, royalties, lump sums or dividends; define the role of your collaborator; incorporate a clause for dispute resolution and set out the method of termination; take specialist advice on market research, tax and legal matters and do not rely on the advisers of your local partner. Although you may be working to a common end, your individual interests may be different; take steps to protect your intellectual property rights and confidential information; set a timetable for implementation of the collaboration, the length of negotiations, and time for the execution of agreements and state approvals to be obtained. Consider having a project manager for the negotiations and a timetable for implementation. remember that for foreign investors, whilst there are approvals and consents to be obtained at both the central and state government levels, red tape has given way to red carpet for foreign investors in India.

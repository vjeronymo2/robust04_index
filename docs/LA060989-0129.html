			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> SUPERVISORS TO CONSIDER LAW BARRING AIDS BIAS  </P> <P> Following the lead of other state counties, the County Board of Supervisors  next Tuesday will consider a law prohibiting job and housing discrimination  against victims of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> A special citizens committee took 18 months to draw up the proposal, which is  expected to win unanimous passage from the five supervisors.  </P> <P> Tom Uram, director of the county's Health Care Agency, said the county's AIDS  anti-discrimination proposal differs from other laws around the state in that  it does not include language dealing with sexual preference and life style.  </P> <P> The county's ordinance, he said, deals only with bias against those suffering  from AIDS or suspected of carrying the human immunodeficiency virus.  </P> <P> "This comes at a very appropriate time," Uram said. "We decided a long time ago  to take a long look at this issue before acting. We are pleased with the  result."  </P> <P> As of May 1, 1,049 cases of AIDS had been reported in the county. The virus has  proven fatal in about 60% of those cases, county health records showed.  </P></p>

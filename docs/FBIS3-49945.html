			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Correspondent Zoran Jevdjovic] Negotiations  about the future of the former Yugoslav Republic of  Bosnia-Herzegovina at the conference in Geneva have been going  on almost without a break since this morning. Everything began  this morning with the plenary session attended by all the  delegations present in Geneva and the co-chairmen. The  discussion in practice concerned talks between the Serbs and  Croats, that is, their highest representatives and the  co-chairmen as representatives of the international community,  with the Muslim representatives, whose positions remain an  enigma, and who are trying -- in one way or another -- to avoid  accepting what is envisaged by the European Union's plan for  solving the Bosnia- Herzegovina crisis. [passage omitted]    During talks with the Muslims at the plenary session, all  the  issues pertaining to the European Union's peace plan were  reviewed with the goal of determining the Muslims' position  toward the proposals and a type of agreement reached between the  Serbian and Croatian sides, which envisages the Muslims getting  33.3 percent of the territory for the Muslim republic in the  former Bosnia- Herzegovina. As I have already mentioned, we  have unofficially learned that the discussion was somber,  primarily burdened by the conflicts between the Muslims and the  Croats. President Izetbegovic again presented new territorial  demands, which -- according to well- informed sources --  primarily pertain to certain towns in eastern and western  Bosnia. President Milosevic intervened in the course of the  discussion, prompted by the positions of the Muslim side and the  positions presented by the representatives of the international  community.    He said that this peace conference had experienced evolution  and continuity and that it could not keep reverting back to the  beginning. The Serbian side, said Milosevic, has approached the  demands of the European Union seriously and responsibly, because  it presumed that the European Union had defined its proposal in  the same way. The European Union's demands, embodied in the  33.3 percent of territory for the Muslim republic, a temporary  UN protectorate for Sarajevo and Mostar, and the Muslim  republic's access to the Sava River, have been fulfilled. The  Serbian side, said Milosevic, had therefore accepted these  demands. That is why, upon accepting the European Union's  proposals, the Serbian side has come to Geneva this time to sign  the peace plan. There can be no doubt, continued President  Milosevic, that there can never be a perfect plan in all its  details, but all the remaining issues can be successfully solved  in mutual relations after establishing peace and in peace.    President Milosevic said that he held the logical view that,  by accepting the European Union's proposals, the conditions have  been established for signing the peace plan and ending the war.  Namely, the remaining remarks and adjustments cannot be a reason  for continuing the war for any of the sides. That is why peace  has to be immediately signed, while possible disagreements  should be left to the interested parties' negotiations in the  continuation of the talks. If the Muslim side should refuse to  sign for peace, said Milosevic, in circumstances when the  European Union's proposals have been accepted, I believe that  the international community is under an obligation to clarify  its positions toward its proposal with the Muslim side, while it  should approach the Serbian side -- which has accepted its  proposal -- in accordance with its obligation to lift the  sanctions against the FRY and the Serbian people. This is its  moral obligation, concluded Serbian President Milosevic at  today's plenary session at which the Muslims' new demands were  discussed, despite the fact that the Serbs, and even the Croats,  have more or less fulfilled everything that has been asked of  them in order to achieve -- in the European Union's view -- a  just peace and future mutual life in the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]    [Begin recording] [Jevdjovic] What does this [agreement with  Croatia] mean in practice? Does it mean that the Republic of  Croatia is still not recognized, or at least not within the  present borders, the AVNOJ [Anti-Fascist Council of National  Liberation of Yugoslavia] borders?    [FRY Foreign Minister Jovanovic] Certainly. This statement  means neither recognition nor the establishment of diplomatic  relations. Both issues call for a separate decision and the  agreement of the two sides. As you can see from the contents  [of the agreement signed today], this has not been achieved and  this was not the objective. The objective was to establish  communications embodied in permanent offices in Belgrade and  Zagreb, which should facilitate mutual contacts and strengthen  the orientation of the two sides [words indistinct] of peace and  political solutions for the remaining controversial issues,  which are not few, because their scope is considerable after the  Yugoslav republics' secession from Yugoslavia [sentence as  heard]. Therefore, there is no reason for any kind of  speculation that this decision could mean prejudging any of the  remaining political issues, least of all the issue of the  Serbian Krajina, which needs to be solved according to the Vance  plan in direct negotiations between the legitimate  representatives of the Serbian people living there and the  Croatian Government.    [Jevdjovic] Does that mean that although the Croats have not  as yet recognized Krajina, they have -- by accepting this  document -- given up resolving the situation in the Krajina  militarily?    [Jovanovic] This statement means that as well, although we  need to wait and see whether this will be strictly implemented  in practice. However, [words indistinct] a guarantee for such a  development, it is certain that (?we have made) a significant  positive step toward strengthening this option toward the  peaceful resolution of this issue through political negotiations  with the legitimate representatives of the Krajina. This  remains in the domain of the Krajina's legitimate  representatives, and no one else has been authorized to solve  this, nor do they wish to do so. [end recording]</p>

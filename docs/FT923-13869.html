			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ministers hint at delay in Maastricht progress THE strength of Tory opposition to the Maastricht treaty has prompted senior ministers to prepare the ground for a possible delay until early next year in government efforts to ratify the accord on European political and monetary union. Mr John Major is said by his colleagues to remain keen that the ratification process gets under way again before he hosts the Edinburgh EC summit in early December. That would mean a renewed Commons debate - and a direct confrontation with Tory opponents of the treaty - soon after MPs return in October from their summer recess. The prime minister remains convinced that in spite of the promised revolt he will secure a majority for the legislation. He is also concerned that his government should be seen during its presidency of the Community to be living up to its commitment to the accord. But in what is being seen at Westminster as a calculated attempt to give the government maximum flexibility, ministers are letting it be known that the legislation might be delayed until the beginning of 1993. They are pointing out that the detailed committee stage of the Maastricht bill will involve intensive and exhaustive debate over several weeks. Scores of amendments have been tabled by Conservative and Labour Euro-sceptics, who have promised lengthy filibusters to delay the passage of the legislation. Against that background, some of Mr Major's colleagues are floating the idea that debates running late into the night for a number of weeks might dilute the efforts of ministers to secure a successful outcome to the Edinburgh summit. It might be more sensible, they argue, to defer the legislation until January. No firm decisions on timing will be taken until after the French referendum on the treaty in September. Assuming that produces a Yes vote, the government will then wait for the Danish government's promised plan to reverse the anti-Maastricht vote recorded in a referendum last month. Those proposals are also expected in late September or early October. Mr Major will by then also have a much clearer idea of the Labour party's strategy towards the legislation. Mr John Smith, the opposition's leader-in-waiting, will not oppose the principle of ratification but he might support the disruptive tactics promised by the Tory rebels. Ministers insist, however, that there is no question of delaying the ratification process until it is certain that the Danish government will overturn its electorate's rejection of the treaty. The view in Whitehall is that a second Danish referendum is unlikely to take place before next spring and that it would be impossible to delay the British legislation until then.</p>

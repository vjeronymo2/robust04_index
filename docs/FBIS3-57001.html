			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yefim Shvartsman] </F>   [Text] Kiev January 24 TASS -- The Ukrainian leadership is  seriously concerned over the character of political  confrontation in the Crimea following the first round of  presidential elections there on January 16. This anxiety was  expressed in the Sunday analytical programme Perekryostok  (Crossroads) of Ukrainian TV.    Perekryostok reminded people once again of the right,  granted  to President Kravchuk by the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of  Ukraine, to cancel resolutions of local government authorities  running counter to the Ukrainian constitution (in the opinion of  observers, the presidential elections in the Crimea are just the  case), and gave the floor to Yevgeniy Marchuk, head of the  Ukrainian security service. He described the situation as  criminally dangerous and urged the rivals to act within the  limits set by the law.    Taking into account the polarization of opinions in the  Crimea itself over the future of the peninsula before the second  round of the presidential elections, scheduled for January 30,  as well as the fact that two obviously political assassinations  took place in the Crimea over the past month (Captain Andrey  Lazebnikov, head of the press service of the Black Sea Fleet,  was killed in Sevastopol last December and Iskander Mamedov,  deputy to the Crimean parliament from the Crimean Tatars, died  of wounds in Simferopol last Friday, following an attempt on his  life), one cannot but agree that the concern of the head of the  Ukrainian security service is well-grounded and his warning is  timely.</p>

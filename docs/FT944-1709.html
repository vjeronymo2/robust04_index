			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / How to miss on the inflation target Last Thursday, another unnoticed official report* was published, that of the Retail Prices Index Advisory Committee (on which I sit) on the treatment of owner-occupier housing costs. Because of the government's short-sighted policy of restricting copies of such documents, most journalists have seen only the press release. This covered merely the majority report which favoured continuing to measure homeowners' costs in the RPI by mortgage interest payments, but with a slight modification to include an element of home depreciation which makes hardly any difference. The origins of the report, over which the committee toiled for 2 1/2 years, was Whitehall's concern that using mortgage interest payments to measure home ownership costs had a perverse effect on public perceptions of inflation, the conduct of economic policy and the success of that policy. The mechanism by which we shoot ourselves in the foot is straightforward. When governments worry about inflation, they sanction interest rate increases which feed back into the RPI. The result is worsening inflationary expectations, reduced confidence and attempts at wage and price push by unions and employers. This leads to still greater inflationary worries, still more interest rate increases and still worse inflationary expectations. The vicious circle can be, and has been, broken by sufficiently determined policy, but at an unnecessarily high cost in lost output and employment. The committee majority believed that the job of the RPI was not merely to measure inflation but to provide an automatic adjustment for incomes, for instance in pay and benefits. In fact, the idea that everyone can contract out of the effects of a credit squeeze is sheer illusion, which simply postpones adjustments and makes their timing perverse. As the committee sat, Whitehall seemed to get cold feet about reforming the RPI. Once it became clear that there was no one clear alternative measure of inflation, only a battery of indicators, some officials took fright lest negotiators should always go for the highest variant. But the need for such a battery is just a fact of life. The phoney inflation peak of nearly 9 per cent in 1990, when the economy was already entering recession and which did so much damage, was due not only to mortgage interest rates, but also to poll tax effects and the impact of a temporary oil price explosion before the Gulf war. I am, however, inured to governments losing interest in their own original standpoint and I persevered with a minority report. The root of the problem is that the previous method of estimating homeowners' costs by means of the equivalent rent for similar accommodation has not been available since the collapse of the market in private letting. There is no one perfect alternative and my own proposals are designed to entrench and build on what has already been achieved in interpreting the RPI. To start with: the underlying rate, or RPIX, should now be given equal prominence to the headline RPI in official pronouncements. As a consequence, the headline RPI should cease to be the sole legal definition of the index. This is, in any case, the way the world is going. Price indices being developed by the European Commission are certain to exclude home ownership costs as being too difficult to measure and compare between EU members. While the committee was going round in circles, the Bank of England had developed further indices to help measure inflation. These include RPIY, which excludes some indirect taxes as well as mortgage interest payments. There is also the housing adjusted index, HARP, which attempts to treat the purchase of houses like that of any other consumer durable. My recommendation is that the Bank of England should update every month the indicators in its quarterly Inflation Report and indeed publish them independently. The Bank could do this straightaway. But the CSO (Central Statistics Office), too, should get round to publishing a wider list of indicators attached to the RPI press notice, including the new comprehensive Inflation Index on which it is working. My final recommendation may be the most controversial. This is that the RPI Advisory Committee is an anachronism which should be placed into honourable retirement. Apart from it being a corporatist survival, there is the basic fact that a price index cannot be devised by a varying selection from a group of 21 people sitting round a table every few weeks. The director of the CSO should have the same responsibility for the RPI that he has for other statistical series. *CM 2717, Pounds 10.65</p>

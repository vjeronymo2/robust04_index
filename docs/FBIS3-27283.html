In an interview with XINHUA, Meciar said Slovakia wishes to  learn from China's experience in economic reforms and in  establishing a market economy.    He said his country admires China's success in transferring  a  central-controlled economy into a market-oriented one. Learning  how to achieve this transfer is very important for Slovakia, he  added.    He also said that there are great potentials yet to be  developed in economic relations between the two countries, and  that he will bring new proposals to China.    He said that Chinese entrepreneurs will have opportunities  to  invest and get profits in a Slovakia which is undergoing an  economic privatization process. He also wished that financial  and monetary exchanges and cooperation with China will attain a  higher level.</p>

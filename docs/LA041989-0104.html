			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> TRINITY'S CROUCH ATTENDS MEETING WITH PRESIDENT  </P> <P> Paul F. Crouch, founder and president of Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting  Network, was among 16 evangelical leaders who met with President Bush on  Tuesday. The religious leaders requested the meeting because of what one called  a "crisis of confidence" following Bush's statements last month indicating he  opposes tuition tax credits for parents of private school students. Bush  assured them he still favors the tax credits, adding, however, that because of  budget restraints he is unable to push for them now, the White House said. In  addition to tax credits, the evangelicals and Bush also discussed their mutual  opposition to abortion.  </P></p>

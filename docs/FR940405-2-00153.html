			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the proposal will change the time by which exercise notices will be assigned under DGOC's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Procedures  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1002. Currently, exercise notices are assigned at or before 8 a.m. on the business day following acceptance of an exercise notice by DGOC's clearing bank. Under the proposal, assignments will take place at or before 5 p.m on the same business day that the clearing bank accepts an exercise notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal will permit participants with short positions to receive more timely notice of their assignments of exercises and will allow them to manage more precisely their financial exposure following assignments by permitting them to engage in other trading on that business day. The proposal also will provide a method whereby DGOC will allocate exercise notices in a fairer manner. The new cutoff time for submission of exercise notices, the pro rata assignment of exercise notices, and the earlier notice of assignments are consistent with the policies and practices of the over-the-counter market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DGOC states in its filing that upon publication of this notice DGOC will inquire of all its participants that maintain long positions with DGOC whether they perceive any special burden associated with the one hour reduction in the time available for exercise. DGOC states that if any participant should wish to maintain the 5 p.m. exercise notice tendering time on any outstanding option, DGOC will defer implementation of the proposed rule change until one day following the expiration of all such outstanding options subject to the 5 p.m. time. DGOC further states in the filing that once the formal inquiry of participants has been completed, participants should expect to receive notice from DGOC that all options issued by DGOC and expiring after a certain date will be subject to the changes made in this proposal. From its informal polling of participants, DGOC estimates that implementation of the 4 p.m. cutoff time shall occur during the first quarter of 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DGOC believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and particularly with section 17A of the Act in that it will facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions. <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 15 U.S.C. 78q&hyph;1 (1987) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / International Company News: Minorco claims a future in mining - The Anglo deal gives scope for specialisation IT MAY be fortuitous that Anglo American chose to announce a reorganisation of its international assets only four days after Nelson Mandela called for a final lifting of economic sanctions. It is certainly not inappropriate. It would be difficult to name a company which has suffered more during the sanctions years because of its South Africa ties than Minorco, the offshore natural resources associate of Anglo American, the country's largest company. Five years ago this month, Minorco's Pounds 3bn (Dollars 4.5m) bid for Consolidated Gold Fields foundered amid massive negative publicity on anti-South Africa feeling. The bid was supposed to be the first part in a strategy that would convert Minorco from a sleepy investment holding company into one of the world's largest natural resource groups - a dynamic, 'hands-on' operator of its assets. Things did not work out that way. The abortive Consgold bid served only to highlight Minorco's parentage - a considerable liability at the height of the sanctions era - and considerably hamper efforts toward its main strategic aim. Minorco was subsequently forced to spend much of its time trying to deny its roots. Yesterday's announcement of a Dollars 1.43bn asset swap - in which Anglo will transfer the bulk of its offshore assets to Minorco, which, in exchange, will issue 55m shares and transfer its African assets to Anglo - makes clear that all this has changed. Minorco is claiming to have transformed itself from a holding company into an operating company in natural resources. Upon completion of the transaction, Anglo's shareholding in Minorco will increase to 43.1 per cent from 39.3 per cent. Anglo's associate, De Beers Centenary, will, meanwhile, increase its shareholding to 22.6 per cent from 21.1 per cent. Also, three more Anglo directors will go on to the Minorco board, and three Minorco directors will come on to Anglo's. Commenting on the improved political climate, Anglo said: 'South African companies can now be seen to be involved internationally and not deny their roots.' Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman of Anglo and Minorco, said the deal flowed from Anglo's re-entry into the world community. He said the previous structure of some of Anglo's offshore holdings 'had been imposed on us by South Africa's pariah status', and it was now possible to rationalise these. He said it was also necessary to avoid the possibility of competition developing between Anglo and Minorco. Anglo refutes suggestions the deal might involve the shifting of assets offshore, away from the reaches of a potentially interventionist government. It notes the deal merely involves a rearrangement of assets that were, anyway, outside of South Africa. Indeed, in the current climate of strict exchange controls for the movement of capital offshore, the Reserve Bank (central bank) would almost certainly have denied approval if it had thought the balance of payments might suffer. The deal was welcomed by analysts as a logical development benefiting both companies. As Mr Ogilvie Thompson noted: 'It will increase substantially Minorco's proportion of operating assets by bringing together fragmented international holdings under Minorco's ownership, while African holdings will be brought together under Anglo's and Centenary's ownership.' One effect of the deal is that Anglo has effectively nailed its colours to the mast as a predominantly African group. It believes the political rapprochement between South Africa and its neighbours will bring a number of business opportunities better handled from Johannesburg than Luxembourg (where Minorco is registered) or London (where it is based). Anglo, of course, will retain a large spread of offshore interests through its interests in De Beers and Minorco. Mr Ogilvie Thompson says the group hasn't excluded the possibility of offshore deals. The restructuring comes against the background of a similar 'tidying-up' exercise within South Africa, where Anglo has sought to rationalise its industrial investments into Amic, its industrial arm. Mr Ogilvie Thompson said yesterday that while Anglo had set itself against unbundling - as Gencor and Barlows, two other South African companies, have done - it had always been prepared to rationalise activities with the aim of making them more focused and transparent. Copper is very much at the heart of the deal. Anglo now takes control of Minorco's 49.9 per cent stake in Zambia Copper Investments (ZCI), whose sole investment is a 27.3 per cent stake in the ZCCM, the state-run Zambian copper company up for privatisation. Anglo is favoured to re-enter the Zambian copper scene, where its interests were nationalised over 20 years ago. Minorco, meanwhile, takes responsibility for the potentially large copper investments of Anglo American South America (AMSA). Anglo recently announced plans for AMSA in Chile and Peru which, taken together with likely involvement in Zambia, could see the group becoming the world's largest copper producer.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On July 13, 1993, the Department took the unusual step of publishing a draft Notice of Fund Availability (58 FR 37819), specifically inviting public comments on the Department's proposed methodology for implementing the provisions of section 312 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (1992 HCDA), which added sections 251&hyph;257 to the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101&hyph;625, section 601 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA), approved November 28, 1990) (LIHPRHA). The comment period expired on August 28, 1993. The Department received a total of 26 comments. Two comments were from legal/advocacy organizations; eight were from low-income housing organizations that are involved in development of and advocacy for affordable housing; nine were from tenant organizations; three were from community development corporations; two were from community service organizations; one was from a local government agency; and one was from an individual housing consultant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This NOFA implements sections 251, 252, 253, 255, 256, and 257 of LIHPRHA, as added by section 312 of the 1992 HCDA. This NOFA does not implement section 254 of LIHPRHA, which will be implemented soon through a separate NOFA. Therefore, the comments received on section 254 as a result of the draft NOFA published July 13, 1993, will not be addressed here, but will be considered in that separate NOFA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The first section of this NOFA is a discussion of the public comments and modifications from the draft NOFA that were made in response to the public comments and as a result of additional HUD consideration. The actual NOFA follows the discussion of public comments and begins with the section designated ``II. Purpose and Substantive Description.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Direct Technical Assistance Grants  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Resident Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed NOFA required each applicant for a technical assistance grant to notify the residents of the property of the application. Seventeen commenters requested that this requirement be clarified or strengthened. Six commenters requested that the notification be in writing, and be required to include a summary of the proposed plan for the property including items on the development team, budget, and proposed tasks. The Department has adopted this recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters requested that the notification advise that residents themselves can also apply for grant funds and can endorse an eligible organization of their choice. Several others said this information should be given, not by the applicant, but by the Department, possibly as part of current resident notification forms under 24 CFR part 248. The Department has decided to require, as part of the applicant's resident notification, a statement that residents may themselves become eligible grantees. One commenter said the notice must have a name and contact number for the intermediary and the applicant. The Department has implemented this requirement. The same commenter suggested that intermediaries be required to supply a copy of the application with translations. The Department has decided that this requirement would be too burdensome on the intermediary and too costly to the Department. In general, however, translation expenses would be considered a reimbursable expense under the grant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Three commenters expressed concern that owners may thwart access to buildings to prevent distribution of notices and/or resident meetings. Therefore, HUD should require managers to provide addresses of tenants to intermediaries, and any costs to owners would be reimbursable. The Department agrees that this could be a problem in certain cases. If the applicant is having difficulties getting access to the building, it may contact the administering intermediary, who will have the authority to contact the owner for access to the property and the names and addresses of residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Twelve commenters requested, as part of resident notification, an advance notification of application submission for technical assistance, followed by a tenant comment period. Many of these commenters also requested the inclusion of a requirement that the applicants meet with the residents prior to application submission. The comments ranged from requiring a 15-day notice prior to application submission, to a 30-day comment period following a resident meeting, with a seven-day notification that the meeting itself will take place. One commenter said at least two resident meetings should be required, one informational and one for tenant comment. One commenter suggested that the tenant comment period could partially overlap with the administering intermediary's review of the application so there would be less delay in grant awards. Another said that the general requirement to notify all residents could be too burdensome in large projects, and when owners are not cooperative, the applicant could simply certify that a public meeting was held.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department seeks to maximize resident participation, where appropriate, without unduly delaying the grant award process. Therefore, the Department will require written notification that a resident meeting will take place. This notification shall include summary information on the grant proposal and an indication that the residents will be able to comment on the grant proposal subsequent to the resident meeting. The meeting shall occur at least 14 days prior to application submission and resident comments may be submitted to the intermediary and the applicant during that 14-day period. If there are substantive objections by the residents, the applicant must provide a response to the residents and to the intermediary before the grant can be awarded. If necessary, the applicant will meet again with the residents to resolve issues. In any case, if a majority of residents are opposed to the application, the application will be rejected.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

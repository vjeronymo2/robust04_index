The product manufactured last  year constituted 83.8 percent of that of the year before,  including 86 percent at conversion enterprises. At the same time  the extent of the basic defense order at plants and factories of  the military-industrial complex is declining: The share of the  "profile" product in their total output declined from 52 percent  in 1990 to 31 percent last year.    Similar proportions may be observed also in respect to the  persons employed in the production of peaceful commodities and  those destined for the army: One-third of the employees of  enterprises of defense industry were employed last year in the  manufacture of "profile" products, although 48 percent of  personnel had been working on "peaceful products" in 1990 even.    But the situation in the military-industrial complex was  more  complicated than in other sectors: The level of pay was  approximately one-third below that of industry as a whole, and  numbers of the personnel in the year declined 12 percent, which  was 10 percent more than in mechanical engineering and double  that of industry as a whole. Some 165,000 persons were released  from conversion enterprises last year, and the debt for  purchased products constituted R1.2 trillion, and debts to  suppliers past due, R854 billion.    The directors of the defense works are attempting to emerge  from the current situation independently: Thus in the funding  structure the proportion of resources allocated from the federal  budget for enterprises due for conversion constituted in 1993  some 21 percent compared with 24 percent in 1992. But the  proportion of borrowed funds in the funding of conversion  increased from 41 percent to 44 percent, on the other hand--this  being mainly bank credit--but only 0.3 percent of all borrowed  money came from foreign investors.    Eighteen percent of the products manufactured by the  conversion enterprises was shipped outside of Russia in 1993,  and military equipment and arms constituted one-third of export  supplies.</p>

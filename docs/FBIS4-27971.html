			<p>BFN     [Text] The Philippine Government yesterday welcomed the  results of the Cambodian peace talks which ended last 28 May in  North Korea, the Department of Foreign Affairs [DFA] announced  yesterday.    "The Philippines believes that the security of the region is  based on the principles affirming the right of every state to an  existence free of external interference and to determine its own  future," DFA spokesperson Susan Castrense said.    During the peace talks, the Cambodian Government and the  Khmer Rouge agreed to form a standing committee to begin meeting  this 15 June so that issues dividing the two sides in Cambodia's  civil war could be dealt with.    Foreign affairs officials pointed out the Philippines has  played an active role in seeking a "comprehensive, fair, and  reasonable political settlement" of the issue on Cambodia  through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.    It will be recalled that Manila dispatched 702 security  personnel to Cambodia as part of its contribution to the United  Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia after the  UN-sponsored Paris Agreement was signed in December 1991.    On the level of ASEAN, the Philippines participated in the  Asia-Japan Tripartite Cooperation in Cambodia in response to an  invitation made by the Japanese Government. Manila also  contributed $100,000 to the UN Trust Fund for the Cambodian  peace process in response to an appeal made by UN Secretary  General Butrus Butrus-Ghali.    The Philippines recognized Kampuchea in April 1976 as the  legitimate representative of the Kampuchean people.</p>

			<p><P> August 5, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOSING FOOTBALL TEAMS IS THE COLISEUM'S FAULT  </P> <P> If the Raiders leave (which I hope they don't), blame it on the Coliseum. That  is the worst place to watch a football game. With the "Olympic" track and one  end zone being about 100 yards away from the playing field, the crowd is  totally removed from the game.  </P> <P> Why pay to go in a stadium when you can't even see the game?  </P> <P> JOHN FLETCHER  </P> <P> El Cajon  </P></p>

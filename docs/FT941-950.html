			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / London Tecs fail to unite Business advice services may remain fragmented in London because Training and Enterprise Councils in the capital are failing to make a joint bid to the government for an all-London advice and counselling service, Lisa Wood writes. It is understood that after nearly a year of talks Tecs on the outskirts of London believe that they have more in common with Tecs and business customers in areas such as the Thames Valley and Sussex than with Tecs and businesses in the centre of London. One London Tec director said: 'The outer London Tecs felt the inner London ones were ganging up on them.' The slow progress highlights the problems of the nine London Tecs. There are still few examples of co-operation in their main activities - the administration of government training programmes and promotion of economic development. A year ago London Tecs were awarded Pounds 250,000 by the Department of Trade and Industry to work with partners including the London Chamber of Commerce to create a unified advice service under the Business Link banner. Business Link is the brand name of a new initiative which seeks to bring together, throughout England and Wales, the plethora of organisations offering advice to businesses. In most areas the outlets, which have not yet been launched nationally, involve only one Tec and its local chamber of commerce, and sometimes other partners including enterprise agencies.</p>

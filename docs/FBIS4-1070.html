			<p>BFN     [Text] In-depth talks between the Afrikaner Volksfront  [AVF, Afrikaner National Front] and the Freedom Front could lead  to both the Conservative Party [CP] and the volksfront taking  part in the elections. This comes after Freedom Front Leader  Constand Viljoen approached AVF president and CP leader Ferdie  Hartzenberg with proposals on participation at provincial level.    This morning, Dr. Hartzenberg said he would take part in the  election only if certain conditions were included in the  constitution. These include the guarantee of a volkstaat  [homeland] if more than 800,000 voters cast their ballots in  favor of as volkstaat at provincial level. The second condition  is that the volkstaat be granted political independence but  economic interdependence. If General Viljoen accepts Dr.  Hartzenberg's proposals, he will approach the government and the  ANC. Dr. Hartzenberg said Gen. Viljoen should withdraw from the  election if the government and the ANC refuse to accept the  proposals.</p>

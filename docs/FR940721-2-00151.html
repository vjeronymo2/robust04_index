In order to move toward self-sufficiency, development in one area should be balanced with development in the others. Consequently, comprehensive development strategies should address all aspects of the governmental, economic, and social infrastructures needed to promote self-sufficient communities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANA's SEDS policy is based on the use of the following definitions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Governmental infrastructure'' includes the constitutional, legal, and administrative development requisite for independent governance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Economic infrastructure'' includes the physical, commercial, industrial and/or agricultural components necessary for a functioning local economy which supports the life-style embraced by the Native American community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Social infrastructure'' includes those components through which health, economic well-being and culture are maintained within the community and that support governance and economic goals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These definitions should be kept in mind as a local social and economic development strategy is developed as part of a grant application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A community's movement toward self-sufficiency could be jeopardized if a careful balance between governmental, economic and social development is not maintained. For example, expansion of social services, without providing opportunities for employment and economic development, could lead to dependency on social services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conversely, inadequate support services and training could seriously impede productivity and local economic development. Additionally, the necessary infrastructures must be developed or expanded at the community level to support social and economic development and growth. In designing their social and economic development strategies, ANA encourages an applicant to use or leverage all available human, natural, financial, and physical resources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In discussing their community-based, long-range goals, and the objectives for the proposed projects, ANA recommends that non-Federally recognized and off-reservation groups include a description of what constitutes their specific community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ANA encourages the development and maintenance of comprehensive strategic plans which are an integral part of attaining and supporting the balance necessary for successful activities that lead to self-sufficiency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> C. Proposed Projects To Be Funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provides descriptions of activities which are consistent with the SEDS philosophy. Proposed activities should be tailored to reflect the governance, social and economic development needs of the local community and should be consistent and supportive of the proposed project objectives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The types of projects which ANA may fund include, but are not limited to, the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Governance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Improvements in the governmental, judicial and/or administrative infrastructures of tribal and village governments (such as strengthening or streamlining management procedures or the development of tribal court systems);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Increasing the ability of tribes, villages, and Native American groups and organizations to plan, develop, and administer a comprehensive program to support community social and economic self-sufficiency (including strategic planning);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Increasing awareness of and exercising the legal rights and benefits to which Native Americans are entitled, by either treaties, the Federal trust relationship, legislative authority, or as citizens of a particular state, or of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Status clarification activities for Native groups seeking Federal or State tribal recognition, such as performing research or any other function necessary to submit a petition for Federal acknowledgement or in response to any obvious deficiencies cited by the Bureau of Acknowledgement and Research (BAR), Department of Interior, in a petition from a Native group seeking Federal recognition; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Amendments to tribal constitutions, court procedures and functions, by-laws or codes, and council or executive branch duties and functions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

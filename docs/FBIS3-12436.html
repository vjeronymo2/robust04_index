Speaking at a news  conference today, the minister says he opposes the idea of  dismantling the Jewish community in Hebron and the settlement of  Qiryat Arba'. Mark Weiss reports:    [Begin recording] [Weiss] The police minister said members  of the force's Serious Crime Unit are still searching for four  Kakh activists on the list of five that will be placed in  administrative detention, and he expressed confidence that they  will be found soon. He said some Kakh activists will be totally  disarmed, and others will only have their automatic weapons  taken away. He called the crack down on the extreme right an  extraordinary act for a democratic country. However, he  stressed that Kakh has less than 100 members and Kahana Hay even  less, and he does not believe they have large numbers of  sympathizers.    Shahal said he opposes the dismantling of the Jewish  community in Hebron and the settlement of Qiryat Arba', because  this would mean a major change in the Declaration of Principles.  The major problem, he said, remains ensuring the security of  Israelis.    [Shahal] We didn't have any guarantee from the Palestinians  that they are going to prevent any kind of terror or violence.  Still, we are optimistic enough to go on with the process. So,  there is no need to come after this act, horrible as it was, and  to change an agreement between the Palestinians and Israel.  They have our guarantee that the Israeli Government will  prevent any kind of terror or violent act, and we are doing more  than any other country that I know of with all of our ability to  do so. There is no question about it.    [Weiss] The police minister predicted that the Palestinian  police force will remain somewhere between 7,000 and 9,000  strong, and will not be significantly increased because of the  massacre.

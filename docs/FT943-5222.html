			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / World Bond Markets: Waiting for a rise in European rates - Capital &amp; Credit The impact of higher European economic growth on inflation and interest rates will be crucial to the performance of European government bond markets this autumn. So far this year, the markets have had a terrible time. German government bond yields have risen by 1.7 percentage points to more than 7 per cent from a low point of 5.5 per cent at the beginning of the year. In the UK, the increase has been even greater, with yields rising by 2.5 percentage points to more than 8.5 per cent. This turnround from last year's bull market was sparked by the US Federal Reserve's decision in February to raise short-term interest rates, which many investors took as the turning point in world interest rates. Seven months later, however, investors are still waiting for European rates to turn upwards. Europe has left recession far behind, yet strong economic growth is showing few signs of feeding through into higher inflation. The economic data is impressive. German industrial production grew at an annual rate of 2.2 per cent in July, while inflation remains around 3 per cent. 'Against that background, the Bundesbank is likely to trim interest rates further,' said Mr Ken Wattret, international economist at Midland Global Markets. In the UK, gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent in the second quarter but underlying inflation, at 2.2 per cent, is at its lowest level for 27 years. Despite the continued good economic news, financial markets remain unconvinced that European governments will be able, or willing, to stop inflation from rising again as growth continues. 'The current high bond yields show that investors' inflation expectations are still high and that they expect interest rates to rise soon,' said Mr Ceris Williams, director of fixed interest at Rothschild Asset Management. However, many analysts are confident that yields will fall back as investors become convinced by continued good economic data that inflation will be subdued for a while yet. 'We may well see a recovery in bond prices once markets are reassured, but it is a gradual process and market sentiment is fragile,' said Mr Wattret. It is in Europe's 'peripheral' bond markets, such as Sweden, where the scope for a reduction in yields is perhaps the greatest, in the medium-term at least. Sweden, plagued by concern over its ballooning public debt, has seen bond yields rise this year from around 7 per cent to as high as 12.5 per cent last month. 'Despite the volatility, Swedish bonds offer good value with yields this high,' said Mr Williams. In fact, current high yields make most European government bond markets attractive. 'Investors are being paid a substantial premium for holding bonds as opposed, for example, to cash,' he added. German 12-month cash deposits currently provide returns of about 5.2 per cent, whereas 10-year bonds yield 7.2 per cent. In the UK, 12-month cash deposits yield 6.8 per cent and 10-year bonds 8.5 per cent. However, it is not just worries about inflation that are weighing on investors' minds. Many European countries are running large government deficits, and the fear of a greater supply of bonds to fund those deficits has been a drag on European bond markets throughout 1994. As the end of the year comes closer, with many countries' borrowing programmes far from complete, those fears are intensifying. 'There are still a lot of deficits out there which need to be funded, and concern about supply is beginning to rear its head more and more,' said Mr Wattret. Daiwa, the Japanese investment bank, estimates that Germany has raised slightly less than half of its funding needs for the year, with only four months remaining. The UK, on the other hand, is more advanced. Just five months into its fiscal year, it has raised Pounds 10bn out of a total requirement of Pounds 30bn. Germany is lagging mainly because it has been reluctant to borrow at the prevailing yields, preferring to wait for them to fall. Similarly, Spain has been forced by high long-term yields to shift its funding from the long end of the market to relatively cheaper shorter-dated debt. Concern about increased supply, with the possibility of a more expansionist president being elected next year, will probably be one of the main negative influences on the French government bond market for the rest of this year. In August, both Sweden and Italy raised their official short-term interest rates for the first time in this economic cycle, to the consternation of European bond markets. On Wednesday, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, and Mr Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England, hold their regular monthly meeting to discuss UK monetary policy. A decision at that meeting to raise UK interest rates would perhaps be a greater test of current bond market sentiment than the moves by Italy and Sweden. It would be a sign that the turning point in European interest rates is really here at last.</p>

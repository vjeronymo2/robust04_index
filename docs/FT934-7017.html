			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / The Lex Column: A taste for Guinness There has been something of a turnround in City sentiment towards Guinness, whose shares have risen by 13 per cent from last month's trough. Part of the reason is the more robust message coming from management. First came the shake-up at the top of its spirits division, though that can only be judged when a replacement is found for Mr Crispin Davis, its former chief. Guinness has also made a concerted effort to reassure the market about the durability and usefulness of its links with LVMH. Last week's sale by LVMH of its Roc beauty products division will further calm fears that it might sell its 24 per cent stake in Guinness to raise cash. It would have to be foolish - or desperate - to do so at this stage of the cycle anyway. Perhaps more important is the way Guinness is tweaking its message about brands. There is less talk now about trading up in scotch, and more about securing market share by demonstrating the inherent value rather than the mere status appeal of its brands. That applies even at the lower end, which Guinness has neglected in the past. Guinness may thus derive premium value for its brands across the price spectrum in a way that is less dependent on a tendency to trade up. In beer, Guinness is pushing its stout brand in a way that seems consciously designed to distract from the continuing embarrassment of its foray into the Spanish domestic lager market. No doubt this new formulation of its strategy appeals because it corresponds better to the drinks market reality. Guinness is adamant that it is not in the business of discounting. Nor is it simply living in the hope that its customers will soon begin to trade up again. A better-defined sense of purpose may have stopped the short-term rot in its share price. It will still be a long while, though, before that translates into a significant recovery of profits.</p>

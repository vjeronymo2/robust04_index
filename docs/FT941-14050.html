			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Hong Kong offers airport cash lure Hong Kong, in an effort to break an acrimonious deadlock with China over its ambitious new airport, offered to sweeten the deal by putting in more of its own capital, Sir Hamish Macleod, the financial secretary, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. He was speaking as legislators approved by a vote of 38-2 the government's request for further funds for the USDollars 20.5bn (Pounds 13.8bn) project, caught up in the row over Governor Chris Patten's efforts to bring greater democracy to Hong Kong before the 1997 handover. They voted for a HKDollars 1.29bn (Pounds 112m) allotment for the next stage of construction and agreed to a government request for a further HKDollars 377m for day-to-day costs. Sir Hamish said the government still sought China's approval - vital if the airport is to attract international financing at attractive rates - but would press on with construction work meanwhile. Beijing has rejected two financing packages for the airport, arguing that they would leave Hong Kong with a debt mountain on its reversion to China in 1997. But many in Hong Kong believe China is attempting to use the airport, one of the largest infrastructure projects in Asia, to press Mr Patten to abandon his plans for democratic reform. The government earlier rejected a halt to construction in the hope of reaching agreement with China.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Rocco in a hard place If business is as bad as Forte claims, it must regret that the Grosvenor House is unlikely to host another Christmas party for the EBRD this year. By and large it is getting no benefit from recovery and almost all the trading profit improvement during the second half reflected cost savings. That gives a certain intellectual justification for cutting the dividend. The practical reason is even more compelling. Forte's balance sheet looks strained despite the Gardner Merchant sale. At some stage it will still need a rights issue. With the dividend cut to a level that should allow room for growth as earnings recover, Forte will have a more encouraging story to tell when the moment for the rights issue eventually comes. It has also used the Gardner Merchant disposal profits to shield a kitchen sink approach to exceptional charges. That will boost the chances of an earnings recovery whatever happens to the economy. Similarly, the rigour applied to property valuations will maximise the disposal profit allowable under the new accounting rules from any hotels that are sold. In the midst of this, Mr Rocco Forte looks surprisingly cheerful. Perhaps the new non-executive directors have strengthened his determination to break with the traditions established by his father, but that does not give him a free hand with strategy. Talk of further expansion in Europe is muted now, and the emphasis is on further disposals, starting with the loss-making Travelodge hotels. All in all, the company is talking of eventual disposals worth Pounds 500m to Pounds 600m. That is a measure of the extent to which Forte must shrink before it can grow again.</p>

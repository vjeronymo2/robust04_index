			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Plan for simplified tendering: Defence THE Ministry of Defence has a running programme of reforms aimed at cutting bureaucracy and simplifying procedures for its suppliers. It announced plans in November to market test each year for the next four years Pounds 1.2bn worth of services and facilities provided in-house. The idea is to open up new areas of activity to competition. At the same time, a fortnightly billing scheme was introduced by the ministry to ensure prompt payment to contractors. This year the MoD expects to pay more than Pounds 12bn to nearly 20,000 contractors. Future plans to cut red tape include restricting the number of companies invited to tender for contracts so that time is not wasted by unsuitable bidders, reducing price investigations on non-competitive contracts, and introducing simpler arrangements for the commercial exploitation levy on products developed for the MoD.</p>

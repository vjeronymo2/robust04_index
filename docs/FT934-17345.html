			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Tecs not backing sub-standard training Sir, The picture painted by Martin Pollard ('Incompetent trainees 'being let loose in the workplace'', September 24) is wrong. The overwhelming majority of Training and Enterprise Councils only fund electrical industry training that leads to National Vocational Qualification Level 3. This is the appropriate standard for that industry and Tecs work closely with the industry to ensure it happens. Mr Pollard is wildly out of date. Tecs are not in the business of funding sub-standard training. They exist to increase the quality of training in all sectors of business and industry so that organisations can improve their skills and competitiveness. To suggest otherwise is thoroughly misleading. Edward Roberts, chairman, TEC National Council, 24-28 Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2PX</p>

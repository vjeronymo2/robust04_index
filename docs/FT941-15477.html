			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Chazot to lead Eurotunnel Mr Georges-Christian Chazot, a French industrialist, was yesterday confirmed as the new group chief executive of Eurotunnel ahead of the launch of its cross-channel rail services, which will start in the spring. Mr Chazot, who will be responsible for the day to day running of the group, will take his position on Monday. 'He will be in charge of turning the company into a profitable organisation over the next few years,' said a spokesman for Eurotunnel. The appointment means that Sir Alastair Morton, who had been acting as chief executive, will revert to his role as co-chairman alongside Mr Andre Benard. Both, however, are expected gradually to reduce their roles in the running of the company. Eurotunnel said Sir Alastair was 'looking forward to no longer working 150 per cent on the project and just doing a normal full-time job.' He would still be involved in raising Pounds 1bn (Dollars 1.5bn) in fresh capital to complete the financing of the project; in settling outstanding claims with British Rail and SNCF; and in preparing for the official opening of the tunnel on May 6. In November Sir Alastair was appointed chairman of the British government's private finance working group, charged with finding ways of involving private money in public projects. He is expected to spend one day a week on this task. Mr Benard said that Mr Chazot had been selected because of his international experience and technical and commercial background. 'He had the profile we were looking for and he has a very international experience.' Most of Mr Chazot's experience comes from industry. An engineering graduate, he has spent most of his career at Alcatel, the French-based telecommunications group, and Schlumberger, the electrical engineering group. He also has experience of the services sector, his most recent position being the head of French operations for Adia, the Swiss temporary employment group.</p>

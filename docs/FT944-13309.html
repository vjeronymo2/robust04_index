			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Securities firm settles charges Prudential Securities yesterday concluded an agreement with US government prosecutors to settle charges that it defrauded hundreds of thousands of investors in the 1980s who bought high-risk limited partnerships from the Wall Street firm. The investors claimed Prudential Securities brokers did not inform them fully of the risky nature of the investments, many of which lost them billions of dollars. Prudential Securities has already agreed to pay compensation. Yesterday, it agreed to deposit another Dollars 330m in the settlement fund, and the overall cost to the firm of the scandal, including legal fees, is believed to have topped Dollars 1bn. Under yesterday's deal, Prudential will continue to co-operate with the government over settling claims and has admitted wrongdoing. In return, federal prosecutors will dismiss criminal charges if the firm refrains from similar violations for the next three years. Prudential Securities also agreed to take steps to improve its internal supervisory procedures, including appointing a new outside director to the board who will act as an ombudsman and provide quarterly compliance reports to the board's audit committee and the US government.</p>

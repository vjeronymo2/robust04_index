			<p>Intensifying     its ongoing effort to force the British Government  to change its stance on Hong Kong, Beijing returned to  specifically threatening economic reprisals against British  companies unless London withdraws its support for Hong Kong  Governor Christopher Patten's political reform program which was  submitted to the Hong Kong legislature (Legco) in December 1993.  This hard-line stance was most authoritatively expressed by Wu  Yi, minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation (MOFTEC),  who warned at a press conference on 28 January that the British  Government's "uncooperative attitude" on Hong Kong "is likely to  affect (yingxiang) Sino-British trade ties?? (Xinhua, 28 January).  In addition to Wu, other Chinese officials have also recently  gone on record as warning London of the negative economic  consequences of supporting Patten.  According to Beijing's  English-language paper China Daily, Tong Jiemin, deputy director  general of MOFTEC's European affairs department, said that  "bilateral economic and trade relations can hardly escape damage  from an uncooperative and unfriendly Britain" (16-22 January).  Similarly, Lu Ping--the State Council's director-general of the  Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office--was reported by the PRC-owned  Hong Kong daily Ta Kung Pao of 18 January as telling a group of  Hong Kong businessmen that Britain, because of its stance on Hong  Kong, "is now falling far behind" France and Germany in gaining  access to China's "huge potential market."     Beijing's most recent explicit warnings to London on economic  reprisals contrast with the previous circumspect ion evident in  Premier Li Peng's remarks in mid-December just prior to the  submission of Patten's partial reform bill to Legco.  At that  time, Li had implied that Beijing was contemplating retaliatory  measures--possibly including economic reprisals--if Patten  submitted his reform bill, stating that "frankly speaking, it is  hard to say that the unfriendly, uncooperative attitude of the  British" will not "affect" bilateral relations in "other fields"  (Beijing radio, 11 December 1993).  Chinese leaders were last  observed to specifically threaten British firms with economic  reprisals in late March 1993 when Li warned that Beijing planned  to retaliate against British firms unless London withdrew its  support for Patten's proposals.  PRC media subsequently portrayed  Chinese officials as backing away from such hard-line threats of  punitive economic measures against British investors.  (AUTHOR: SIMON.

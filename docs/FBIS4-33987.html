			<p>BFN     [Text] Dajabon (Dominican Republic), 13 Jun (EFE) --  Hundreds of Haitians were unable to cross the border into the  Dominican Republic today, while Dominican Defense Minister  General Constantino Matos Villanueva was in the area. The  minister traveled to the region to oversee the implementation of  the UN embargo against Haiti.    Meanwhile, Genaro Paulino Alvarez, the Dominican consul in  Quanaminthe, Haiti, told EFE that the Haitians "are dying of  hunger, because the very poor are the ones suffering the  hardship of the embargo." He asked that they be allowed to sell  their goods in the Dominican Republic. Quanaminthe is located 3  km from Dajabon, within the Haitian border.    The consul said that despite the fact the Haitians were  "very  patiently waiting" for the Dominican military to allow them to  cross the border to purchase food and medicine, the presence of  the defense minister made this impossible.    Since the coup d'etat in September of 1991, the Dominican  authorities have allowed the Haitians to cross every Monday and  Friday to buy and sell in the Dominican border communities.  This was suspended at the end of May, when the total embargo,  imposed by the international community, went into effect.    The consul added that Dominican soldiers opened the border  for two hours last Friday for the Haitians to sell their goods.  Alvarez, who is also the Dominican Republic's commercial  representative in the area, said many Haitians have asked him to  allow them to go into these Dominican communities to prevent  their children from "dying of hunger." He admitted that many  Haitians do defy the "sealed border." They try to bypass the  military in order to get to the Dominican stores mainly to buy  food.    The Dominican diplomat explained that about 2,000 Haitians  would come to Dajabon every Monday and Friday to sell clothing,  liquor, household goods, and other items. They would then buy  food. When the border was completely open, however, more than  1,000 Dominican citizens would cross the Haitian border to shop  in Quanaminthe every Saturday and Sunday.    Alvarez said that during the rest of the week, citizens from  the two countries that share La Espanola Island maintain a  constant flow of trade that allows the Haitian population to  purchase food and medicine.</p>

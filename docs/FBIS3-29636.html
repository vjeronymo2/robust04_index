Hosokawa made clear he put priority on a reshuffle during a  three-way meeting with Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social  Democratic Party (SDP), and Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP).    Hosokawa told them it could happen by the end of this month,  the officials said.    Both Murayama and Ouchi were opposed to an early reshuffle,  which may lead to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  being dumped.</p>

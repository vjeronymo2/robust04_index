			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Stronger dollar pulls most bourses higher THE RISING dollar pulled most bourses higher yesterday, writes Our Markets staff. PARIS jumped to its highest level since Iraq invaded Kuwait on August 2, 1990, as foreign institutions went on an afternoon buying spree of cyclical stocks with exposure to the US. The CAC-40 index pierced the 1,900 level with relative ease, and closed 30.14 or 1.6 per cent higher at 1,912.21 in heavy volume of FFr2.8bn. Program buying was noted. Saint Gobain was the day's biggest gainer, adding FFr30 or 6.1 per cent to FFr525, and accounting for 10 per cent of the CAC-40's rise. Lafarge rose FFr19 to FFr333. Both companies have significant dollar earnings. Car stocks were also in demand, with Peugeot rising FFr13 to FFr718 and Michelin adding FFr6.10 to FFr164.10. Credit Local de France made a rare appearance in the top 20 volume list as it continued to rise, closing FFr1.40 higher at FFr231.10 with 213,850 shares traded. On the way down was Total, which lost FFr3.60 to FFr256.90 on concerns that lower oil prices would erode its refining margins. Remy Cointreau fell FFr9.70 or 5.1 per cent to FFr180.30 with only 4,600 shares traded. Dealers said the stock had collapsed after the family withdrew its support last week. FRANKFURT rose by nearly 1 per cent as the strong dollar helped exporters, and weaker oil prices industry in general; the DAX index put on 13.92 to 1,694.99 after a 5.49 rise to 691.10 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume improved to DM6.5bn from DM4.4bn. Among exporters, Siemens rose DM8 to DM678 and Volkswagen DM4.70 to DM343, while Metallgesellschaft, DM6.50 higher at DM414, was also rated as a dollar beneficiary given that its metal sales contracts are expressed in the US currency. Technical reasons were also advanced for the gains, including volatility ahead of Friday's expiration of DTB futures and options contracts, buying in advance of the Siemens' dividend payment on March 12 and reaction to recent weakness in Metallgesellschaft, up DM15.20 over two days. Hochtief led construction stocks higher with a DM37 rise to DM1,199. Mr Robert Willis of Hoare Govett said that Hochtief's meeting with analysts last Thursday in London had left some of the latter disappointed, but that the underlying picture was strong. AMSTERDAM closed higher, boosted by the dollar. The CBS Tendency Index rose 1.6 to 123.6. Oce, the photocopier and office systems group, which reported an expected rise in 1991 net profits, gained Fl 3.10, or 4.4 per cent, to Fl 73.50. The market reacted positively to the rise in the 1991 dividend to Fl 2.25 from Fl 2.00. Elsevier rose Fl 2.10 to Fl 109.50 on news that it was selling its 19 per cent stake in a commercial television station. Unilever ended at a record high, lifted by the strong dollar and investor confidence in the food sector: it gained Fl 2.70 to Fl 189.90. Begemann, the engineering group, fell as low as Fl 90.00 before closing up Fl 1.50 at Fl 98.00, following last week's government decision not to grant it an export licence to build submarines for Taiwan. MILAN continued to weaken, as sell orders hit an empty market. The Comit index fell 6.29 or 1.2 per cent to 526.89, perilously close to its chart support level of 525, in turnover estimated at L85bn after L80.3bn. However, leading stocks recovered after the fixing, for example Generali's last trade was L30,300, compared with an official close of L30,160, down L540. Pirelli, whose capital increase started on Monday, saw its ordinary shares fall L47 or 4.3 per cent to L1,069, while the rights lost 40 per cent. Dealers said the shares came under pressure on signs that Mediobanca's support operation was too thin and on rumours, described as unlikely, that a broker connected to Pirelli was in financial trouble. Some brokers said they were advising clients to look beyond the gloom which obscured second-line stocks with good prospects. Mr William Cowan at Mito Intermediazioni said he was keen on Benetton and Edison in the wake of favourable company meetings. Benetton is likely to repeat 1991's performance in 1992, with a profit increase of 16-17 per cent, while Edison (formerly Selm) is expected to get a massive boost to energy capacity, and to profits, in the next two years. Both stocks resisted the bourse's weak trend. Benetton slipped L35 to L12,115 and Edison, which has encountered profit-taking near L4,000, eased L19 to L3,944. ZURICH led on medium-capitalisation stocks as the SPI index rose 6.5 to 1,127.5. Surveillance rose SFr160 to SFr7,680, Holderbank by SFr160 to SFr4,660 and Alusuisse by SFr19 to SFr953. Mr Nigel Spence of Baring Securities said that Swiss blue chips had been enjoying a rally for two months now, that people were looking for laggards and the very brave for cyclical stocks like Holderbank, and Alussuisse in metals. MADRID was led higher by the banking sector: the general index rose 2.17 to 261.41. Banco Santander gained Pta130 to Pta4,710 while Tabacalera moved up Pta110 to Pta6,440, another record high. COPENHAGEN was not happy with the 51 per cent jump in Unidanmark's group net loss to DKr1.7bn for 1991, and the bank fell DKr8 to DKr207 in heavy volume of 170,000 shares. The CSE index fell 0.68 to 351.04.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - FEB 18                           Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1139.71  1139.23  1140.76  1141.72  1142.40  1142.73  1143.54  1143.83          Day's High  1144.39          Day's Low  1138.67    Feb 17       Feb 14        Feb 13        Feb 12       Feb 11   1135.65      1130.78       1136.68       1136.12      1137.74  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

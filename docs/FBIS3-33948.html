The explosion of the  device that was hidden in a garbage container wounded two guards  and caused material damage.    Reporting this, our sources said that a meeting of senior  military officials of tyrant Saddam's regime was scheduled for  that day, but the explosion caused chaos and forced the  officials to postpone the meeting. No party has claimed  responsibility but reports indicate that the explosion is part  of some settling of accounts among Ba'thist regime members.</p>

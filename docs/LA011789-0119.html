			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> MAN ADMITS HE SET FIRE TO ESTRANGED WIFE'S CAR  </P> <P> An Anaheim man confessed to fire investigators Monday that he set fire to his  estranged wife's car at her apartment complex, authorities said.  </P> <P> Randy Weisenberg, 42, was already in the city's jail facility on suspicion of  drunk driving when he admitted that he doused Cheryl Weisenberg's 1984 Ford  Thunderbird with gasoline, set it afire and drove away, Anaheim city  spokeswoman Carolyn Griebe said.  </P> <P> The car fire occurred in a carport in the 400 block of South Clementine Street  about 11:25 p.m. Saturday. Shortly after the fire, Anaheim police arrested  Randy Weisenberg after they chased him for allegedly running two red lights.  They caught up after his car overturned. A blood test indicated that he had a  blood-alcohol level of 0.14, Griebe said. A person is considered intoxicated  under state law with a blood alcohol level of 0.10 or greater.  </P> <P> Witnesses identified Weisenberg as the man who set fire to the car, police  said. Weisenberg allegedly started the fire in his wife's apartment complex  carport, which is attached to several apartments, Griebe said.  </P> <P> "They were in divorce proceedings, and the motive is believed to be that he had  some kind of problem with the wife and the divorce proceedings," Griebe said.  </P> <P> The fire caused an estimated $2,000 damage to the car. No one was injured in  the fire.  </P></p>

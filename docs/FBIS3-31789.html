			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by G.R.: "The Dangers of Low Flight"] </F>   [Text] The Western military alliance has still not given  the signal for the end of danger in Bosnia, and the people in  the military leadership of the Bosnian Serbs are aware of this.  During the past week they have been warning that "attacks  against our positions will not pay off for the possible  aggressor." The prevalent opinion in the Srpska republic army  is that in case of an attack, every tenth "steel bird" in a  squadron comprising 60 to 70 planes would not return to base.    If the NATO planes overflying Serbian positions as part of  the "Deny Flight" operation were given the order to unload their  deadly cargo, they would have to descend to an altitude of 20,00  meters due to the fog and snow in the Sarajevo area, at which  point they would become an easy target for the Serbian artillery  and various antiaircraft defense systems. The Srpska republic  army currently has in its possession 20-mm, 23-mm, 30-mm  (Praga), 40-mm (Bofors), and 57-mm antiaircraft guns. The  "Bofors" are the most precise ones, because they have a laser  rangefinder device combined with an "Erickson" radar.    The missile batteries are comprised of SA-2 missile systems  with an 18 km vertical, and a 50 km horizontal range; SA-3  missile systems with a 15 km vertical, and a 25 km horizontal  range; SA-6 missile systems with an 18 km vertical and 60 km  horizontal range; and SA-9 missile systems with a 5 km vertical,  and 7 km horizontal range. The SA-6 and SA-9 missiles can be  maneuvered. In addition to this, the popular Arrows (SA-7),  Russian "Needles," and the U.S. portable systems, the well-known  "Stingers," are stationed in around 100 significant buildings in  the Srpska republic. Owing to sensitivity to electronic  jamming, the missile systems are combined with guns and portable  antiaircraft projectiles [as published].    Antiaircraft guns cannot be electronically jammed,  therefore,  these weapons, when properly masked and entrenched, could pose a  significant threat to the low-flying NATO planes piloted by  Englishmen, Turks, Frenchmen, Americans.... According to  certain information, NATO pilots already have some 200 targets  in the Srpska republic marked on their maps which would be  bombed in case an order to launch air strikes were issued. The  Western military alliance's threats are, according to the latest  information, still topical. That is why the public is still  speculating what would happen if the Bosnian Serbs were to take  UN Protection Force troops as hostages in the event of air  strikes. According to Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency member Ejup  Ganic, if this situation were to arise, the NATO planes  (Falcons, Tornadoes, Mirages....) would bomb military targets in  Serbia, bridges, and the Banja Luka suburbs.    Luckily, NATO did not have to go through with this "baptism  of fire," but its planes continue to "slash" the skies over  Bosnia. The United Nations is planning to open Tuzla airport for  traffic on 7 March. According to UN information, this operation  again envisages the participation of the Western military  alliance's planes.</p>

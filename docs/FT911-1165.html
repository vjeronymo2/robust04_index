			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / International Company News: Aerospatiale and MBB in joint helicopter venture AEROSPATIALE, the French aerospace group, and MBB, the German aerospace manufacturer, have created a joint venture - Eurocopter International - to market jointly each others' helicopters. This is a step towards the full merger of the helicopter businesses of Aerospatiale and MBB, as agreed in outline last year and passed by the European Commission competition authorities in February. The pair have combined sales of FFr10bn (Dollars 1.6bn) - of which 70 per cent comes from the French partner - making it the world's second largest helicopter supplier after Sikorski of the US. Aerospatiale has 27 per cent of world helicopter sales outside the US and the Soviet Union - considered to be closed markets - while MBB has 4 per cent. Eurocopter International is a marketing company equally owned by the pair, and has already started talks on possible civil sales with two Soviet helicopter design departments. By the end of the year, Aerospatiale and MBB expect to complete negotiations on the formation of a holding company, which would pool all their helicopter activities and be roughly 60 per cent owned by Aerospatiale and 40 per cent held by the German partner. MBB, as the smaller partner, will have to make a cash payment to bring its stake up to that level and may adjust its stake, said Eurocopter officials. The pair are awaiting the results of independent company valuations before completing the deal.</p>

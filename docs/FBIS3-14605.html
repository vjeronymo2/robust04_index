He said that postponement  of the meeting, which was supposed to take place in the second  half of March, was due to special circumstances concerning  officials in Egypt.    In a statement to MENA, Dr. al-Majali called for Arab  reconciliation, saying that Jordan sincerely extends its hand to  Arab brothers for solidarity. He said: I think that this  matter is very essential, especially as there is a system being  worked out for the region, and we are afraid that it will be  worked out without consulting us. This will not be to our  advantage. Therefore, we must have Arab understanding and  solidarity, and determine the system acceptable to us in the  region.    Regarding the peace negotiations, the Jordanian prime  minister pointed out that the resumption of the Arab-Israeli  peace negotiations in Washington must take place following  agreement by the Arab countries concerned. Jordan cannot adopt  a separate decision in this regard. He said that this subject  might be discussed on the sidelines of the meetings of the Arab  League foreign ministers council currently being held in Cairo.  He emphasized that no date has been set for a meeting of the  Arab states concerned with the peace process.    Answering a question, Dr. al-Majali denied that any prior  arrangements had been made for a Jordanian-Saudi summit meeting  during King Husayn's visit to Saudi Arabia for the minor  pilgrimage. He said that the Jordanian monarch's visit was only  to perform this religious rite.</p>

Correspondent Yeoryios  Feretis has the details.    [Feretis] For some time now the biggest heroin trafficker  from Pakistan (Fahd Salahuddin), 30, was wondering why all his  associates get stopped at the customs checkpoint at Kipoi,  Evros, and cannot get the heroin to European countries.  Therefore, he attempted to transport the heroin himself. He  took a luxurious Mercedes that he recently bought from a U.S.  senator, and at about 2300 he arrived at the Kipoi checkpoint.  Customs officials welcomed him and when he said that he was in  a hurry and wanted to go through the control quickly, the  customs officials sent the car to the search ramp. The whole  truth was discovered there. Within minutes, the customs  officials discovered 19 kg of heroin in the sides of the car.    [Unidentified police official] This case is particularly  interesting. This is a businessman, not a carrier. He is an  experienced businessman who knows what he is doing; he has large  economic interests, international connections and has traveled  the whole world.</p>

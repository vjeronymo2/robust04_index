			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: A lesson in risk management - Results from top Swiss banks raise doubts about trading strategies All good things come to an end,' the chairman of Union Bank of Switzerland wrote in a surprisingly jaunty opening to the group's interim financial statement two weeks ago. Still, it set the tone well for an unexpectedly bad set of first-half results from the big three Swiss banks, with all reporting substantial double-digit declines in profits. On the common basis of profits before taxes and provisions, the UBS result was down 28.6 per cent to SFr1.97bn (Dollars 1.5bn); Swiss Bank Corporation was down 45.1 per cent to SFr1.19bn; and CS Holding, the group built around Credit Suisse, was off 30 per cent at SFr1.97bn. These results are not dire - all three still achieved returns on equity above 6 per cent and have capital ratios comfortably above BIS standards - but they raise uncomfortable questions about the volatility of some streams of income, and about the limits of the much-touted sophisticated techniques of risk management. The main cause of the profit slides has been big declines in income from trading - the money the banks make from dealing in foreign currencies and trading in bonds, shares and other securities for their own account. UBS was hit hardest, with a 68 per cent plunge in trading income to SFr493m. SBC was not far behind with a 63 per cent fall to SFr537m. CS profit on trading was down 43 per cent to SFr1.27bn. The banks said they had particular trouble with bond and other interest rate instruments, confirming that, like many other investors, they were caught wrong-footed when interest rates rose early this year. However, it is obvious that some were more wrong-footed than others. Some analysts were less than happy that the banks were so willing to attribute their setbacks to 'a difficult environment' (UBS) or 'financial market turbulence' (SBC). The banks have, in the last few years, been emphasising the use of futures, options and other derivative products to manage the risks in securities price movements. SBC, in particular, has invested heavily in this area, acquiring the Chicago-based O'Conner Partners derivatives business. However, it does not seem to have done as well in controlling its risks as CS: its Credit Suisse Financial Products subsidiary, which also specialises in derivatives, matched its strong performance in the first half of last year. The banks also plead that their trading profits in the first half of this year look particularly bad compared with the extraordinary combination of positive forces that came together in the first half of last year. The chart (right), however, suggests they do not compare well with any six-month period in the past two years. One question being asked in Zurich is whether this sort of earnings volatility in a business that now accounts for a substantial proportion of the Swiss banks' overall profits is consistent with their high credit ratings. For UBS, the only Swiss bank which still has triple A ratings from all international agencies, the answer appears to be 'yes'. The group says it felt that, with the exception of the first half of 1993, the swings were within tolerable limits. A related question is whether the banks should be paying out huge performance-related bonuses to traders who just shrug their shoulders and blame unfavourable markets when things go wrong. The implication is that if things go right, it is more because of favourable markets than due to their performance. Still, the banks were all helped in the first half by the disappearance of performance-related bonuses. Personnel expenses were down nearly 12 per cent at CS, due to more incentive compensation at its CS First Boston subsidiary. At SBC, staff costs were down 5.5 per cent, and at UBS there was a 4 per cent decrease. Meanwhile, the three continued to suffer to a surprising extent in the first half from squeezed margins on their basic lending business. Net interest income was well down at all three. Some Swiss bankers had hoped that the competitive frenzy for business in the domestic market would ease when CS acquired Swiss Volksbank last year, but it obviously has not. Mr Hans Kaufmann, head of Swiss brokerage research at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich, notes that there are still more than 100 small regional banks in the country, many of which are weak and desperate for business. Also, according to some reports, the Volksbank takeover sparked off a discreet market share tussle among the big three themselves. Looking on the bright side, some analysts believe the bad figures in the first half and the recent slide in the banks' share prices mean things can only improve. Until now, the only case being advanced for an earnings recovery was that bad debt provisions would continue to fall. The three all made substantial cuts in their provisions in the first half, and both CS and UBS held out the prospect of more in the second. 'An operating improvement from this level is feasible,' Ms Madeleine Hofmann of Credit Suisse said yesterday. Mr Kaufmann, too, said the risk of further big losses in bond markets, or thinner margins on lending, in the second half, seemed small. Still, Ms Hofmann yesterday took the rare step for a Swiss broker of putting out a sell recommendation on SBC.</p>

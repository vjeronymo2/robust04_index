			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] During a meeting on Thursday  evening between the foreign minister of Yemen and Mr. Velayati,  our foreign minister, the two parties exchanged views on the  historical ties between the two countries and regional and  Islamic issues. They also expressed their interest in expanding  and strengthening bilateral relations and stressed the need for  the unity and solidarity of Islamic countries in order to  neutralize the malicious plans of the enemies of Islam.    At the meeting, Mr. Velayati expressed our country's support  for Yemeni unity and said that a solution for Yemen's problems  and the existence of a strong and united Yemen are to the  benefit of peace and stability in the region. He added: Those  who want to create discord in the united ranks of Muslims have  no interest in a united Yemen.    Our foreign minister, pointing out that alien powers cannot  guarantee the region's security, stressed: The expansion of  cooperation among Islamic countries is required for  strengthening the world of Islam. The Islamic Republic of Iran  believes that if such a cooperation had been prevalent in the  Islamic world, the enemies of Islam would not have dared occupy  Palestine, which is at the heart of the Islamic countries.    Mr. Muhammad Salim Basindwah, the Yemeni foreign minister,  described the Islamic Republic of Iran as an important regional  power and called for the expansion of bilateral relations.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEA GUIDELINES FOR ARTISTS  </P> <P> I have a solution to the brouhaha surrounding the NEA that may satisfy all  parties concerned. Instead of funding the NEA from the federal budget, why not  have a box to check on the 1040 tax form that indicates that the taxpayer  wishes to contribute, say, $5 to that agency? That way no one could maintain  that he is being forced to pay artists to spit in his face and the federal  government would still be promoting "artistic freedom."  </P> <P> ROBERT W.D.

			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Financial stability 'Russia's priority': Chubais spells out new phase of development Mr Anatoly Chubais, Russia's newly-appointed first deputy prime minister, yesterday said the country was entering a new phase of economic development with a strong government team in place to reduce inflation, encourage investment and achieve financial stability. Mr Chubais said: 'The explicit instruction of President Yeltsin is that 1995 should be the new stage of Russian economic reform and that we have to reach the goal that was not reached by the reformers since the end of 1991 . . . Privatisation has been achieved. Stabilisation is not yet achieved.' Mr Chubais, the former privatisation minister who has now emerged as the standard bearer of liberal economic reforms, said both President Boris Yeltsin and Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, were committed to the 1995 budget, which aims to bring down the monthly inflation rate to 1-2 per cent by the year-end. 'It seems to me that until now the personal role of Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, his fundamental change of Russian economic policies is still underestimated and misunderstood in the west. His role is crucial and extremely important. Now we have the strong support of Chernomyrdin and of Yeltsin,' he said. Mr Chubais said support from the International Monetary Fund would be 'crucial' if stabilisation was to work and said he was prepared to change some budget details to respond to its concerns. However, Mr Chubais foresaw a fight with the Duma (the lower house of parliament) to enact the budget and accepted the need for compromise. 'We could discuss the structure of the government expenditure. We could discuss the sources of the non-inflationary way of covering the deficit of the budget. But I will not accept changes of principle to the budget,' he said. The government would not waiver over its commitments to reduce inflation to its set targets and to refrain from issuing any central bank credits to fund the budget deficit and from contemplating any rise in government spending on the military and agricultural sectors. The government would also attach a high priority to encouraging greater domestic and foreign investment, Mr Chubais said. 'The main thing which should be done is first financial stabilisation. People will never invest if they have 15 per cent per month inflation. And the second also fundamental task is to reform the Russian security market infrastructure,' he said. Mr Chubais said the Russia's domestic savings had increased from Rbs5 trillion (thousand billion) in January to Rbs15 trillion in July. 'The population is ready to invest but has no ideas what is the reasonable way to invest. That is why they are using MMM. But I would like them to invest not in MMM but in the small machine building factory in Kaluga,' he said. Mr Chubais also met with western business leaders yesterday to discuss ways of encouraging foreign investment. The meeting discussed ways of introducing a more predictable and stable tax regime and of promoting Russia's access to international markets.</p>

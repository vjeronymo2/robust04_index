			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Gan Zhebin (3927 0772 2430)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 13 Jun (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- During a  meeting with a delegation from the Hong Kong Chinese  Manufacturers' Association in Beijing today, Vice Premier Li  Lanqing said that foreign businessmen's investments and  cooperation with China's northern and hinterland regions conform  with China's strategy of developing the central and western  regions, adding that China welcomes their investments and  cooperation with the northern and hinterland regions.    Since the introduction of reform and opening up, China has  achieved a lot of development in its economy but there are still  gaps between regions, Li Lanqing said. Enjoying favorable  conditions, coastal areas are leading in economic development  whereas the hinterland areas are lagging behind in comparison,  he added.    Li Lanqing pointed out: The era is developing, so there is a  need to deepen economic cooperation methods and contents. After  several years of development, some of the "three-capital  enterprises" in the coastal areas should also be upgraded and  renewed. Northern and hinterland regions are superior to  coastal areas in land, mineral, and labor resources and their  transportation and telecommunications facilities are being  improved. Therefore, there are great prospects for foreign  businessmen to invest in and cooperate with the hinterland  regions.    Leung Yam-wing, head of the delegation and chairman of the  association, said that this year marks the 60th founding  anniversary of the Hong Kong Chinese Manufacturers' Association.  The association will hold celebrations in Hong Kong and  Beijing, including a cocktail party in celebration of the  establishment of its Beijing office and a "seminar on economic  cooperation opportunities between Hong Kong and China's northern  regions" to be held jointly with the All-China Federation of  Industry and Commerce on 14 June. Li Lanqing congratulated the  association on its 60th founding anniversary and wished the  seminar all success.    Among those present at the meeting were: Wang Zhaoguo, vice  chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference and chief of the CPC Central  Committee's United Front Work Department; Jing Shuping, chairman  of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and Zhu  Yucheng, deputy director of the XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Hong Kong  Branch.</p>

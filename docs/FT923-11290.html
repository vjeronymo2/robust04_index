			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Why we deserve the Games people play: They are big, brash, and corporatist. And, for a fortnight, they will be inescapable. Nicholas Woodworth ponders the Olympic omens A DECADE ago I felt a passing familiarity with a city of faded, alluring charm. On returning this week to Barcelona for the 25th Olympic summer games, I wandered about a city remade and felt like a stranger striking up a new acquaintance. Gone is the ageing dancehall diva. Massaged and made up, powdered and perfumed, Barcelona is rejuvenated and ready to strut the boards in the greatest show on earth. Catalan energy has worked wonders of transformation. In the past week I have ambled past surging highways where no highways surged before. I have stood by new ports where ships have yet to dock, trundled up hillside escalators to vast virgin acres of glass and marble, and lost myself in entire planned suburbs - now home to hordes of athletes, officials and journalists - that have risen overnight. There is not a lamp standard from which a five-ringed banner does not fly, not a hoarding from which Olympic sponsors do not hawk their wares. Even today, as excited crowds swarm over 42 Olympic venues, the last lick of paint is barely dry on a brash, brave and shiny new Barcelona. But I have found a retreat from the growing clamour of Olympic triumphalism. For centuries, the Barrio Chino has been a refuge to Barceloneses escaping their own inbred virtues of industriousness and level-headed business sense. Set in the grimy, malodorous alleys lying near the old harbour, it is the traditional haunt of sailors, pickpockets, gourmands, late-night revellers and a Barcelona demi-monde bent on the satisfaction of varied, sometimes illicit, appetites. In La Plata tapas bar, crowded with theatre-goers, I had tart white wine and sardines fresh from the grill. In the modest Bar Cleo I shared magnificent butifarra y judias - sausage and beans - with ham-fisted workers. In La Pineda, I listened to a flush-faced tippler, a migrant like so many in this bustling city, give passionate voice to the songs of his native Andalusia. And in the Paloma ballroom, remnant of an earlier age, I watched elderly ladies flutter their fans in the warm air and wait coquettishly for an invitation to dance the paso doble. * * * The world of Mediterranean sensuality may not have disappeared entirely under the weight of the new Olympic Barcelona but, even in the scurviest bar of the Barrio Chino, the influence is inescapable. Take the simple relieving of summer thirst. Ask for a drink of water here and you are likely to receive a bottle of Fontdor, the 'official' Olympic water. Estrella van Damm is the beer which officially sponsors the Barcelona Olympics. Freixinet is its official wine. Minute Maid is its official fruit juice. And Coca-Cola, as no one can avoid knowing, is the official soft drink of the Games. Anyone foolish enough to boycott official Olympic drinks this scorching summer in Barcelona might find himself very thirsty indeed. The commercial hijacking of every liquid imaginable is not a heavy charge to lay against the Olympic movement. There are many heavier. While Barcelona roars into first gear with today's opening ceremony, the International Olympic Committee is as swamped by as many accusations concerning the perversion of Olympic ideals as it has ever been. From the pettiness of unprincipled gift-taking to the enormity of unleashing on the world a bloated, over-commercialised Olympic organism whose size and growth is now out of control, the IOC, it seems, can do nothing right. The committee, runs the diatribe, is an all-powerful, secretive organisation answerable neither to athletes nor to world sports enthusiasts but only to Juan Antonio Samaranch, its high-handed, dictatorial president. Under his rule, critics say, the IOC has been transformed from a selfless endeavour of high moral aspiration into a full-time, cut-throat, profit-making business corporation. Cities wishing to host the Games now pay about Dollars 40m (Pounds 20.9m) apiece simply for the privilege of wooing the IOC with their bids. Barcelona's spending for the Games and new infrastructure amounts to Dollars 4.58bn. Worldwide commercial sponsorship of the Games by Coca-Cola and 11 other multinationals stands at Dollars 180m. Profits from television rights are enormous. The US network NBC alone has paid Dollars 401m to broadcast the Games. Profits by athletes are even further out of proportion, critics allege. This year Michael Jordan, who is appearing in Barcelona with the US basketball team, will receive Dollars 21m in product endorsements. So high have the stakes become that athletes are willing to do anything to win: Britain's Sports Council cites a study claiming that more than 50 per cent of international athletes would be willing to take a drug that guaranteed them an Olympic gold medal even if it killed them within a year. * * * Good grief, what has become of the world? Have the Olympics become so insidious an institution that they have caused us to lose our reason? Could they, in the age we live in, be anything other than what they are? Sitting in the sun in the Barrio Chino's palm-tree-studded Placa Real the other day, an ice-cold, official drink at hand, I decided to take a step back from it all and consult a higher authority. A weighty and worthy tome by one Professor Richard D. Mandell never leaves my side at these Games. Sport: A Cultural History might be couched in over-academic language but it provides a suitably hefty counter-weight to the Olympic razzmatazz that encroaches on every side. 'All societies, including our own,' I read, 'require self-discipline, the suppression of aggression, and widely accepted justifications of the social order. There have always been social or professional classes to interpret the random happenings of the universe and otherwise to maintain by propaganda and by force the existing political order.' So far, so good. I read on. 'The prevailing interpretations of the cosmic order or theology, in order to be made manifest or be given concrete visual or otherwise perceivable form to the society as a whole, requires symbolically presented, well-observed public performances or festivals.' The good professor, I took it, was talking about sport. 'New technologies and new political organisations regularly result in new varieties of theatrically presented contests that symbolically affirm the correctness of the social order that fosters them.' In dazzling sunshine and 35`C heat, I found it a mouthful, but on further perusal began to see what Mandell was getting at. Sport evolves as a product of its own surrounding environment; it not only reflects the social and economic values of its age, it also reinforces them. Every epoch and every society has found a different purpose and meaning in sport. Take the Mesopotamians, for example. One of the earliest military dictatorships, Mesopotamia had no time for adolescent pixies waving coloured ribbons on the gymnastics floor. The idea was to demonstrate the fierceness and military skill of the regime in order to impress the populace and scare off foreign enemies. Thus lion-slaying, boxing, and mean feats on the two-wheeled chariot were the sports of the day. Dynastic Egypt, on the other hand, had no use for such machismo - it lay protected from aggression by the desert and developed a stultified ruling class that evolved little over the millennia. Pharonic rule gave rise to formal, stylised sports generating visually and aesthetically attractive recreations - witness didactic frescos of slender youths illustrating 122 precise and elegant wrestling positions. On the island of Crete, ancient sport was altogether different. The Minoans were an aesthetic, pacific and theocratic people. They served their gods with poetry, ecstatic dancing and acrobatics. Leaping through the horns of a raging bull and then hand-springing from its back may sound like simple showing-off. In fact, it was part of a complex, sacred ritual of a highly religious society. In China, a mandarin administration devoted to the protection of the empire's long borders from marauding Mongol hordes gave birth to sophisticated equestrian arts. In Japan, chronic internal disorder gave rise to the samurai class and the evolution of swordsmanship, archery, gunnery and martial arts such as jujitsu. Everywhere, in fact, even in ancient Greece, sport reflected the economic and social ethos of its place and time. Today, we like to hark back to a classical Olympian age when sport was pure, idealistic and untrammelled by grubby considerations of power, money, and a score of other modern Olympic bugbears. But things were not, it seems, quite like that. Winning an event in the ancient Greek Olympics meant more than earning a garland of olive leaves. Winning was proof of the favour of the gods; such favour meant that the city-state the athlete represented could proceed confidently in the various political, commercial and military endeavours in which it competed with other city-states of the Hellenic world - Olympia, in one sense, was the Brussels of the ancient world. Idealism was never in it, not even for the athlete himself who, for all but the early Games, was strictly professional and performed for large financial inducements. England's industrial revolution has given us other gods and other sports. It produced the capitalist age and sporting events that suited the means and ideals of urban mass production. Sport became rationalised, standardised, measured and quantifiable. Gone, for example, were the spontaneous ball games of the pre-industrial age where, in chaotic melee, entire rural populations would run, throw or kick a stuffed pig's bladder between one village and the next. In its place evolved the highly supervised, theatrically presented entertainment that today arouses the passions of millions of city dwellers around the world. Whether it is association football or any other modern sport, the evolution of complex rules, team hierarchies and precise calculations of times and distances lends itself to our market-oriented obsession with verifiable accomplishment. Such sport, concludes Mandell, 'not only eased, but actually promoted, the mental adaption of the whole population to the demands of the modern world.' Long after the industrial revolution, we are more obsessed with acquisition and verifiable accomplishment than ever. This is the age of the leveraged buy-out, the corporate raider, the dramatic success and shameful failure of junk-bond trader Michael Milken. Winning in this society is what counts. Why our surprise and outrage, then, that sport is a mirror image of the world as it actually exists? Could drug-pumped sprinter Ben Johnson have come into being if Milken had not? If we lived in a theocracy, our sports might be directed towards spiritual salvation. If we lived in a militarist society, today's Olympic opening ceremony might resemble Hitler's 1936 Berlin extravaganza. But we do not. Most of us live in democracies shaped by consumerism and the trans-national corporations that supply it. We like Coca-Cola; we like Nike running shoes; we like Panasonic VCRs and Visa cards. We live in a corporate age, with all its benefits and evils, and our sport is corporate sport. Complaining is no use. If we want it otherwise, we will have to change the way we live. I shall continue to enjoy my occasional retreats into the anachronistic world of the Barrio Chino. But I shall also enjoy the spectacle of the brash, modern, corporate Olympic Games. We have, after all, got what we asked for. More Olympics, page VII</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of Hong Kong (13): Straddling the markets of China and the outside world - Profile of Bank of East Asia TO THE outside world, the Hong Kong banking scene is so dominated by the big names of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, the Bank of China and Standard Chartered, that the smaller groups tend to get overshadowed. One of them is the Bank of East Asia (BEA), a bank with Dollars 50bn of assets whose headquarters nestles behind its giant neighbours in Hong Kong Central. The bank was founded in 1918 by a group of Cantonese merchants who wanted to create an alternative to the British dominated commercial groups of the day. Today, its largest shareholders are the Li family, descendants of one of the founding families, and its chief executive is a member of that family, Mr David KP Li. BEA has made a speciality of straddling the markets of China and the outside world, and this is reflected in the fact that its two largest institutional shareholders are the Bank of China and Societe Generale of France. Mr Li himself was British educated and holds British nationality, but is well-connected in China. The bank consists of two distinct sets of businesses. On one side there is the 58-branch strong retail operation which caters to the local personal and corporate community, and is the fourth largest banking network in the colony. On the other is a wide range of international joint ventures. The bank has had a branch in Shanghai since 1920, which it has managed to keep open through all the political upheavals. Further Chinese branches are planned. The bank is also expanding its branch network in Europe and North America - 'Mr Li is well-known in both east and west' says a Hong Kong banker. 'He uses his contacts well.' Mr Li's policy has been to build the bank by means of partnerships with other institutions. In China, BEA set up an air catering company with the aviation authority CAAC, which also runs restaurants and supplies food to foreign embassies. It has a joint venture in software with IBM in China too. Elsewhere, the bank has forged links with institutions such as Aetna Life of the US, SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, and Bank of America with whom BEA introduced credit cards into the Hong Kong market. One of its largest affiliates is Trilease International, a leasing joint venture company with Bank of China and Societe Generale. Much of what drives the BEA is a desire to create an alternative to the dominance of the Hongkong Bank - 'the Hongkong Bank is so strong,' says Mr Li. 'I want strong partners overseas to help us.' Last year, BEA increased its profits by 16 per cent to Dollars 388m. But like all Hong Kong banks, that result was after a transfer to inner reserves so it only tells part of the story. One local analyst says the bank's heavy exposure to China could become a liability. Mr Li agrees that times could be tough for the colony's smaller family-owned banks - 'I see lots of consolidation over the next two or three years. Overheads will hurt. Profitability is not that great.' Even his own bank could merge, he says. But he professes confidence about the future. His bank, he points out, was the only one which increased its branch network while the Sino-British negotiations were going on - 'the economic prospects here are much better than people think,' he says. Unlike the Hongkong Bank, he has no plans to shift its base out of the colony - 'we are basically a Cantonese bank. We'll continue to be Hong Kong regulated because we have confidence in the future of Hong Kong.'</p>

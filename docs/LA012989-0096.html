			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BONELLI PARK DEVELOPMENT SUFFERS SETBACK  </P> <P> Los Angeles County has suffered a setback in its plans to commercially develop  part of Frank G. Bonelli Regional County Park.  </P> <P> The county had asked for bids from developers last summer to build golf and  equestrian centers at the park. But last week a Los Angeles Superior Court  judge nullified those requests, ruling that the county had ignored the legal  authority of cities near the park.  </P> <P> Judge Miriam Vogel, ruling on a lawsuit filed last year by a citizens group  called the Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park, said the county must consult  with the park's Joint Powers Authority, which is composed of six nearby cities,  before soliciting bids from developers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Approval Blocked  </P> <P> The judge's ruling prevents the County Board of Supervisors from approving an  agreement with a firm that had successfully bid to build a driving range and  pro shop next to the Mountain Meadows Golf Course in Pomona. The ruling also  nullified the county's request for bids to develop a 500-horse equestrian  boarding center, an offer that had been met with no response.  </P> <P> The ruling was hailed by Ronald Vera, the attorney for the citizens coalition  formed by residents enraged by the county's plans to have a hotel-restaurant  complex developed in the park.  </P> <P> "I think it gives us everything we asked for going in," Vera said.  </P> <P> San Dimas City Councilman Denis Bertone, co-chairman of the coalition, called  on Supervisor Pete Schabarum to reconsider his plans for the park in light of  the ruling.  </P> <P> "We want Supervisor Pete Schabarum to heed the will of the people and  discontinue any efforts to commercially develop the park," Bertone said.  Schabarum represents the area containing the park and has spearheaded efforts  for commercial development. The park is in southeastern San Dimas, next to  Pomona and La Verne.  </P> <P> Schabarum, in a statement read by Judy Hammond, his press deputy, criticized  Vogel's ruling and said it would have no effect on planned park development.  </P> <P> "Frankly, I think the judge missed that one," Schabarum said in the statement.  "But we'll work through it and get the job done. We'll do what the judge  required, but I fully expect the current park recommendation will still be  appropriate. I'm frustrated by the additional two- to three-month delay this  action imposes on the project."  </P> <P> Previously, the county had operated under the assumption that the Joint Powers  Authority, which is composed of San Dimas, La Verne, Claremont, Pomona, Covina  and Glendora, had no authority over the operation of the park, Hammond said.  The authority meets briefly each year to approve the park's annual budget.  </P> <P> In the wake of Vogel's ruling, neither the county nor opponents of park  development are sure how much influence the authority will now have over park  development.  </P> <P> "It raises more questions than it answers," Bertone said. "The advantage for  the cities is that it gives us more power, but we don't know yet how much."  </P> <P> Vera said the county counsel must, by Feb. 3, provide details of how the county  will proceed with park development under the judge's ruling. If the coalition  is not satisfied with the county's response, a hearing will be held by Feb. 17  at which Vogel will rule on the degree of influence the Joint Powers Authority  should wield.  </P> <P> "I think the Joint Powers Authority is probably going to get some legal counsel  and find out if they have any discretion or if they have to follow the county's  direction," Vera said, adding that the coalition may take action against the  authority if it does not sufficiently assert its legal powers.  </P> <P> The 1970 joint-powers agreement between the county and seven area cities --  Walnut later dropped out of the authority -- gives the authority power to  construct, maintain and operate facilities at the park.  </P> <P> But at the time the Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park filed its lawsuit,  Senior Deputy County Counsel Amanda Susskind said the authority did not have  regulatory power over the park. The authority, she said, was created as "a  financing mechanism" to issue bonds to pay for improvements made to the park in  the early 1970s.  </P> <P> </P> <P> County Control  </P> <P> The state Constitution limits the amount of debt local governments can accrue,  but there is no such limit on lease payments, Susskind said. To take advantage  of the lease payment exception, the county created the authority, which then  floated the bonds for park improvements and leased the improved park area back  to the county, she said.  </P> <P> Under such an arrangement, all control over park operation and development  remains with the county, she said.  </P> <P> In his statement last week, Schabarum said he was bothered by "the larger  question of whether the representatives of the adjacent cities who have no  financial interest or obligation now have some say over how that park operates.  As far as I'm concerned, you either have both (financial interest and  authority) or none."  </P> <P> Bertone said the coalition will now urge the city councils that have  representatives on the authority to take a hard line against park development.  </P> <P> "It's conceivable this could backfire for us," Bertone said. "The cities could  say, 'We want all this development' . . . but I think the sense of the  community is going to come out and the community does not want commercial  development in the park."  </P> <P> Opposition to park development depends on the specific project involved,  Bertone said. Although there is strong opposition to plans to build a 100-room  hotel, 22 chalets and a 24,000-square-foot restaurant and bar, Bertone said  objections to the golf center and horse boarding facilities are less intense.  </P> <P> Although he considers the judge's ruling a victory for opponents of park  development, Bertone said he will caution coalition members to remain active on  the issue.  </P> <P> "The public should not be lulled into a false sense of security by the  decision," he said. "The fight over commercial development in the park is far  from over. . . . The county will do everything possible to skirt the judge's  decision, and the coalition's going to have to be there every step of the way."  </P></p>

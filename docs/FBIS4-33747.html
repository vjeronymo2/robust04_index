			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Javier Rodriguez] </F>   [Text] Havana, 7 Jun (PL) -- The Cuban Foreign Relations  Ministry today said that protecting the inviolability of  embassies headquartered in Cuba is an obligation of the island's  government, in compliance with the provisions of the Vienna  Convention.    This is the explanation that the Ministry gave for  reinforcing security around diplomatic missions in this capital  in the wake of the incident provoked by the forceful entrance of  a group of persons into the residence of the Belgian ambassador.    In statements for domestic and foreign media, Ministry  spokesman Miguel Alfonso said that Cuba and Belgium continue to  reject the permanence of such persons in the building and are  holding talks to enforce commonly accepted principles.    As part of such contacts, the Belgian Embassy handed to  Cuban  authorities an official list of the residence's occupants, 121  men, women, and children.    The Cuban Government recognizes the inviolability of the  Belgian facilities and will abstain from taking any measure that  could affect it although the occupants entered through violence,  Alfonso pointed out.    They also agreed on the impossibility of accepting the use  of  force to avoid established regular procedures to leave the  country, a position that Cuba has already reaffirmed.    The Foreign Ministry offered medical services to the  Belgians, even to the occupants, as well as food, which is  already being supplied with the help of other European embassies.    Alfonso noted that reprisals would not be taken against  those  who leave the residency nor would any obstacle be placed in  their efforts to depart Cuba through the normal procedures.  Nevertheless, if any of them have cases pending in Cuban  courts, this would be taken into account.    When referring to other illegalities detected, he pointed  out  the distribution of political statements to the international  media, after their elaboration inside the building, even though  only authorized personnel can enter and exit the site.    To conclude, Alfonso said that no dramatic developments are  foreseen in the Belgium residency situation in the coming hours.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / People: Calor resignation Alistair Pate has resigned as finance director of Calor Group, the container gas company, with effect from the end of the year. His resignation is a consequence of the reorganisation of the group - completed earlier this year  -which involved a substantial reduction in the number of headquarters staff, following the company's decision to move accounting and customer service functions to six regional offices. Pate's day-to-day responsibilities will be assumed by John Taylor, group financial controller who is also financial director of Calor Gas, the company's main UK subsidiary.</p>

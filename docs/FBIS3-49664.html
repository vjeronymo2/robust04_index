			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky </F> by Tibor Kis; place and date not given: "The Program of  Partnership for Peace Is A Big Step Forward"]    [Text] Hungary welcomes the Partnership for Peace program,  and Budapest regards it as an extremely progressive concept from  the viewpoint of accelerating the European integration of this  region. The Hungarian side sees long-term possibilities in the  cooperation of the Visegrad group. Among other things, these  were the subjects in Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky's  interview for NEPSZABADSAG.    [Kis] A real war of statements was waged in Central Europe  in the days and weeks preceding the summit in Brussels and  Prague; a lot of attacks were also directed at the program of  Partnership for Peace. It seems that the Hungarian politics  tried to distance itself from this heated campaign. What was  the reason for this restraint?    [Jeszenszky] Partly, perhaps, our being well informed. For  us, the program of Partnership for Peace has never seemed  alarming. From the very beginning, we saw something positive in  this concept. We saw the great step forward this represents,  even compared with the NATO position of six months ago. In the  past year, I often met with NATO leaders and the foreign  ministers or other political leaders of NATO members under  formal or less-formal circumstances. Therefore, I had the  opportunity to see this evolution. In addition, it is also well  known that Hungary has good relations with the current  leadership in Russia. As a historian, I am also aware of the  huge responsibility of the U.S. leaders, and of the great stakes  involved. Today it is really imaginable that, as a result of  the changes of 1989-1990, a change could take place in the  division of Europe and a dividing line move further to the East  than previously, not only the welfare line, but also the  political line. However, this would be the worse alternative  compared to the creation of a more uniform European thinking.  All the more so because, for us, the relations with Russia and  Ukraine are extremely important both politically and  economically. Taking all this into consideration, the peace  partnership is a big stake. This idea provides a rather  progressive program, and if we succeed in implementing this,  mankind will gain much more than just security guarantees for a  few Central European countries that will make the democratic  process irreversible, and this is very important for us. In  other words, this is a program that provides both short-term and  long-term promising prospects. This is why Hungary did not show  disappointment and refrained from using a demanding tone.  Besides, I have repeatedly spoken abroad in recent weeks, so  the Hungarian position is well known there. In addition, what  we heard in recent days was even more reassuring; the U.S.  leadership cannot be accused of any kind of naivete; nor can it  be accused of not being aware of the possible dangers and  failing to prepare for worse scenarios as well.    [Kis] To what extent does this program fulfill the previous  Hungarian expectations?    [Jeszenszky] This fulfills the expectations of the Hungarian  Government, and we see a serious development in the NATO  position. A lot is said about differentiation. They often  mention a process of self-selection in connection with the  countries involved, and this is an advantage for us in any case.  This approach represents a faster road toward full membership  or toward very close cooperation for countries that are ready  for this both militarily and politically, countries where  democracy is stable and political control over the Army is  obvious. The quality of cooperation will count, and political  compatibility is as important as the military compatibility of  the countries involved.    [Kis] From the Hungarian viewpoint, which part of the  program is the most essential?    [Jeszenszky] I would stress the fact that the informal  confidence that has developed in the last three and a half years  is now becoming formal through this program, because there will  be a Hungarian representative in the NATO in the framework of  this Partnership for Peace. There will also be a Hungarian  officer at NATO military headquarters, and the daily contacts  that will emerge as a result will make us even more a partner in  the eyes of the Western public and the Western political  leaders. The warning that emerged during the last talks is  important: A security guarantee voiced as a political intention  is not sufficient, because the NATO statute makes it a matter of  sovereign decisions of the member states how they act in case of  a conflict; of course, there is an obligation of common defense  but, within this, individual governments have considerable  freedom of decision.    [Kis] The debate on the Partnership for Peace made a real  test of the Visegrad cooperation. In your opinion, to what  extent is the Visegrad Group in a crisis?    [Jeszenszky] The Visegrad cooperation is not threatened by  the Partnership for Peace. This program does not mean any kind  of conflict. It is a secondary issue whether we coordinate our  positions on the program, we make common statements, or issue  separate statements. There has been no basic difference between  the Visegrad countries regarding their relations with NATO.  However, if we speak about the Visegrad group in a wider sense,  my opinion is that, no matter what others say, this cooperation  does not depend on the intention of some political leaders,  although the role of our late prime minister was considerable.  Actually, the Visegrad cooperation lies on history, geography,  and the common difficult experiences of our recent history, as  well as on our common goals and current situation. In this  respect, these three or four countries are close to each other.  Given the fact that this cooperation lies on facts and not on  political intentions, I am optimistic in the long run too. I am  convinced that the Visegrad cooperation -- Central Europe in a  wider sense -- creates a unity that will continue to preserve a  lot of its culture and bilateral relations in the future too.  Actually, it was the Cold War that divided the original Central  Europe and this Cold War brought iron curtains and dividing  walls between individual countries. It is very difficult to  dismantle the dividing walls between various societies. This  explains the fact that there are occasional regressions in  political relations and tones. However, in the final analysis,  objective factors determine the common fate and cooperation of  these countries.    [Kis] In your opinion, when can Hungary's NATO membership  become timely? According to what scenario can this membership  become a reality?    [Jeszenszky] Regarding the European Union, one can predict  more or less realistically. In the case of the NATO, it is more  difficult to predict, because many things could happen that  might accelerate or slow down the process. However, in my  opinion, the timing of formal membership is not the really  essential thing. The essential thing is that Hungary should  advance this process and fulfill the practical cooperation and  political dialogue. In this respect, Hungary is already a NATO  member in a certain sense. General Shalikashvili also stressed  that they have the closest relations with the Hungarian Army in  this region. Of course, we do not want to outdistance others or  gain advantages at others' detriment, because Central Europe  will actually live or fall together. However, we gladly accept  the pioneering role that we have fulfilled in many respects so  far. We have nothing against others if they can advance  together with us. We can be quite satisfied with Hungary's  relations with the West, including the United States and NATO,  and both the personal and institutional relations have become  very deep since I first stepped into NATO Headquarters in the  summer of 1990. This is quite reassuring for us.</p>

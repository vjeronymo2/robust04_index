			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: PRIME TIME  </P> <P> Real urban steakhouses are becoming rare in Central Los Angeles: places where a  fellow can get a decent slab of protein without crossing the border into  Beverly Hills, two-fisted meat-and-martini joints where an account executive  can blow his Pritikin thing with massive hunks of well-aged sirloin. The  steakhouse belt just west of Downtown has mostly gone over to pupuserias and  small Guatemalan restaurants, a bad thing for fans of the Chandleresque.  Edward's, Vince &amp; Paul's, the Cove and the Bull n' Bush, among other old  places, have shut down just in the last couple of years. The Pacific Dining Car  prices its steaks out of the reach of anybody but six-figure businessmen and  Japanese tourists. Where are the steaks for the common guy?  </P> <P> In the burbs, there are those vast, dark steakhouses decked out with stained  glass and mirrored beer signs in the Rotary neighborhoods of Pico Rivera or  Pittsburgh. Those places have Lincolns in their parking lots and hideaway  corners in their dim, smoky bars, dry Manhattans and soggy slabs of garlic  cheese toast. A traveling district sales manager knows their floor plans the  way an 8-year-old instinctively grasps the layout of a new McDonalds.  </P> <P> But Taylor's Prime Steaks -- which is located at the point where Koreatown and  Little Central America collide, across the street from a raucous Asian  poolhall, close to Salvadoran bodegas, a block away from Mr. $1 Store -- is a  real urban steakhouse, one of the last of the dimly lit breed, decked out with  red-vinyl booths, horsey prints on the walls, and a pickle-nose guy at the bar  who laughs like Thurston Howell III. Prime, dry-aged steak dinners, complete  with soup or salad and spud, run about $12 to $16, which is about half of what  the Beverly Hills places charge. In the '60s, Taylor's was what passed for  high-style cuisine in Los Angeles, and the entryway is hung with rave reviews  that are mostly 20 years old.  </P> <P> Holiday times are festive at Taylor's, even beyond the tinsel that spills over  the bar. Tripping up the stairs into the banquet room, coiffed and lacquered  Hancock Park matrons look straight ahead, flawless in their full-length minks,  grimly facing their husbands' office parties. Groups of businessmen float  toward the door, ties loosened, vests unbuttoned, wearing the sheepish look on  their faces that says they've been drinking since early afternoon. (During the  day sometimes, Taylor's seems like the male equivalent of the Bullocks-Wilshire  Tea Room.) Prep-look nuclear families, headed by ruddy men wearing college  sweatshirts, slouch on banquettes. A gaggle of arty East Hollywood types seems  pleased to be drinking martinis in a place like this. I like the bartender's  way with an Old-fashioned.  </P> <P> Taylor's used to be famous for its wine card; it's a thin, eccentric pamphlet  listing things like '28 first-growth Bordeaux and ancient vintages of La Tache  alongside bottles of '78 Gallo Cabernet and well-aged generic California  "Burgundy," mini-verticals of Jordan Cabernet and BV Private Reserve, but the  wine service is a little unorthodox -- a waitress keeps the tiny wine glasses  filled right to the rim, and the maitre d' periodically comes by to top them up  whether you want him to or not. This may not be the place to try that special  bottle of Latour.  </P> <P> This may not be the place to try shrimp cocktail, either -- the last time I  tried it, the shrimp hadn't quite thawed in their horseradish-spiked catsup.  The bread's no good, the clam chowder's gluey, the pea soup has all the charm  of military rations. The chicken entree is a joke.  </P> <P> The thing to get here, obviously, is steak -- steak and good cottage fries  (some swear by the baked potato) and an iceberg lettuce salad, which is crisp  and cold and globbed with just enough blue cheese dressing. The filet-mignon is  soft, buttery, as rare as you order it, crusted with char; a New York steak is  beefy and rich. T-bones and Porterhouses come sizzling on metal trays; London  broil, kind of stewy tasting, comes sliced, with a horseradish-sour cream sauce  on the side. (You can get horseradish on the side with any steak -- do.) Lamb  chops are thick and juicy as a Jackie Collins novel.  </P> <P> But the glory of Taylor's is the culotte steak, a softball-shaped prime thing  cut from the top of the sirloin. All the steaks here may be aged, but the  culotte is profoundly aged, so much so that the outside can be unpleasantly  gamy, like high meat. If you order it rare, the interior is scarlet, dripping  juice, salted with morbidity, marbled with fat, full of the tremendous mineral  sourness of great meat. It's the steak that time forgot.  </P> <P>  Taylor's Prime Steaks, 3361 W. Eighth St., Los Angeles, (213) 382-8449. Open  Monday-Friday, 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday 4 to 10 p.m., Sunday, 4 to 9  p.m. Full bar. Valet parking. American Express, Carte Blanche, Diners Club,  MasterCard, Visa accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $24-$36.  </P> <P> </P></p>

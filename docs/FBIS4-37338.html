			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Fathi al-Barqawi in Tunis] </F>   [Text] The Fatah Central Committee was scheduled to hold a  meeting yesterday to discuss recent developments, especially the  situation in the autonomous areas in the Gaza Strip and the West  Bank after the Palestinians took charge. PLO quarters here,  however, were surprised by the convening of a meeting for the  Revolutionary Council. The Palestinian leaders who are still in  the Tunisian capital, the headquarters of the Palestinian  leadership, took part in the meeting.    AKHIR KHABAR has learned from sources in Fatah that  President  Yasir 'Arafat told the attendees, only 30 members, that he had  met yesterday afternoon with a delegation from the World Bank.  He said the delegation offered $10 million out of $42 million  that were originally agreed upon at a meeting in Paris last  week. 'Arafat said he turned down the offer.    'Arafat also asked the members of the National Authority  Council to return to the homeland as soon as possible, stressing  the need for the leaders to be among the masses. He praised  Council member Furayh Abu-Middayn, saying Abu-Middayn was quick  and positive in settling some important issues. 'Arafat  stressed that the Fatah movement should remain united so that it  can correct anything that could obstruct the activity of the  National Authority agencies. He, however, emphasized the need  to practice democracy as much as possible under pluralism.    Talking about other factions within the PLO, the Palestinian  president said some of these factions have started to abandon  their hard-line approach that opposes the peace process and are  asking to participate in the National Authority Council.    According to some quarters within the largest PLO faction,  'Arafat had asked that the committees formed by the  Revolutionary Council in its recent session begin working.  Three committees will indeed begin working as of today,  Saturday, in his presence personally. These committees are  concerned with standardizing organizational principles, choosing  qualified personnel, and popular committees.</p>

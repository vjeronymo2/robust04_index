			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Personal View: Russia - not the country you expect Western perceptions of Russia are still desperately awry. Intelligent friends still ask whether there is enough to eat. Such excessive pessimism has scared off western business, so that great opportunities are being missed. Western business needs a balanced view of the pluses and minuses. Let me begin with the pluses. Russia has privatised at a rate unknown in history. By now two-thirds of Russian industry, big and small, is in private hands. Most shares are fully tradeable, to foreign buyers as well as Russians. Shares are cheap. If you spend Dollars 1,000 to buy 'vouchers' and exchange these for a representative portfolio of shares, you will end up owning capital that produces Dollars 20,000 of output each year (at present exchange rates). The comparable output figure for shares bought on the London stock market would be about Dollars 500. From July 1, a new wave of privatisation will begin, covering the rest of industry and huge chunks of oil, gas and telecommunications. These shares will be sold directly for cash, by investment tender, and (given the low purchasing power in Russia) many will represent bargains. As well as a big domestic market, Russia has other advantages. In natural resources, it has amazing reserves of oil, gas, diamonds, nickel, aluminium, uranium, iron ore and land. It is also rich in human resources: an extraordinary supply of well-trained engineers, and a good general level of education in science and mathematics. Business education is minimal but the commercial spirit is widespread. Industrial relations are good. There has been almost no social unrest. Some western companies have noticed all this. They are investing in all kinds of industries, generally with the Russian home market as the chief initial target. Thus we see foreigners in food, drink and tobacco (Mars, Pepsi, Philip Morris), retail and fast food (Littlewoods, McDonald's), engineering (ABB, Otis), telecoms and gas, financial services, hotels, real estate. There are, of course, some major problems: Production: output of manufacturing and mining has fallen by 25 per cent in the last year. But much of this fall is in military hardware, obsolete capital equipment, and ill-designed consumer products. By contrast total household consumption actually rose - by 4 per cent, according to official figures (of income, minus saving), or more than 15 per cent, according to household surveys. Average food consumption is back to 1991 levels. Inflation: this is still high, but it has been reduced from 25 per cent a month in early 1993 to less than 10 per cent. This is due to a massive credit squeeze, with real interest rates now above 5 per cent per month. With continuing high interest rates, inflation can be made to keep falling. But this requires political will. Politics: Russian politics is always difficult but is probably more stable now than at any time since the reform began. The government is a broad national coalition in which most of the key ministries are headed by reformers. Few westerners seem to realise this. It is true that the Duma has a conservative majority, but its conduct has so far been moderate (except for the release of former vice-president Alexander Rutskoi), and its economic committees are chaired by non-conservative deputies. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal Democratic party, will run for president in December 1995, but his chances are poor. Mafia: openness in turn encourages crime. The mafia, already strong under communism, is now all-pervasive. Even so, the streets of Moscow are safer than in New York. Legal system: in fact, the biggest problem for foreign business is still on the legal front. On the one side property rights and commercial law are unclear and there is inadequate legal redress and law enforcement. On the other side there is still too much regulation, too much corruption and too many unpredictable taxes. But Russia's leaders know all this. Only last month, President Boris Yeltsin abolished virtually all export quotas and ordered further simplifications of laws and taxes. Thus, beneath the ripples of conflict and contradictory action, there is a steady tide running towards a regular market economy. Most westerners who visit Moscow for the first time say: 'Is this the country I have been hearing about in the media?' The best answer is: 'Go and see.'

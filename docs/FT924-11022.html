			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Political splintering to accelerate: Rejection of constitutional reform likely to fuel infighting CANADA has tried no fewer than six times over the past 25 years to rewrite its constitution. Each attempt has ended in failure or has hurt feelings somewhere in the country. It is thus not surprising that most politicians reacted to the resounding No vote to the latest package of reforms by asserting it would be a long time before they were willing to sit down again at a constitutional bargaining table. The Canadian people are suffering an equally acute case of 'constitutional fatigue'. But the chances are slim the issues at the heart of Monday's referendum  - namely Quebec's demands for more power, the western provinces' sense of alienation from the rest of the country, aboriginal self-government, and the abolition of non-tariff barriers between the 10 provinces - will disappear. Instead, the players involved in each issue are likely to search in coming months for other ways to realise their goals. The result could be further fragmentation of the Canadian political process, as regional groupings and special interest groups turn up the volume on their demands. The main battleground will almost certainly be Quebec. A jubilant Mr Jacques Parizeau, leader of the separatist Parti Quebecois, saw the 56 per cent vote against the Charlottetown reform package in the French-speaking province as a mandate for nationalists to step up the sovereignty drive. 'We can now determine our future without being frightened again,' Mr Parizeau said on Monday night. By contrast, Mr Robert Bourassa, Quebec's Liberal premier, is firmly in the federalist camp. 'We cannot conceive that disintegration of the federation would be an advantage to Quebecois,' he said. Mr Bourassa faces the tough job of convincing the electorate they have something to gain by remaining within Canada. Voters in other parts of the country showed on Monday that Quebec cannot expect any special favours - such as the Charlottetown agreement's provision of a permanent 25 per cent share of House of Commons seats. Mr Bourassa must call an election within two years and, despite his heavy defeat in the referendum vote, it is by no means certain he will meet the same fate in an election. The separatists have yet to translate the rejection of the Charlottetown agreement into enthusiasm for independence. Despite the referendum result, opinion polls show that support for a break-up of the country has actually flagged in recent months. Canada's 700,000 aboriginal people, who would have been among the main beneficiaries of the Charlottetown deal, will also not take the referendum result lying down. The package promised them a right to self-government, enforceable by the courts after five years. Indian and Inuit leaders plan to press as hard as ever for greater autonomy for their communities. Ripples from the referendum will certainly be felt in federal politics as the next general election, which must be held by November 1993, draws closer. The Bloc Quebecois, the federal wing of the Parti Quebecois, is hoping the No vote in the referendum will translate into substantially higher representation in the House of Commons. Any gains by the wing would be at the expense of the ruling Progressive Conservatives, who currently hold a majority of Quebec seats. The Conservatives also have much to lose from defections to the Alberta-based Reform party, which fought the Charlottetown Accord on the grounds that it offered too much to Quebec. Since its inception four years ago the Reform party has captured wide support in western Canada, with a populist platform rejecting official bilingualism and wanting a stronger voice for the west in Ottawa. All three national parties - the Conservatives, the Liberals and the New Democrats - thus face the prospect of a more divided and fractious parliament after the next election. In the meantime the Conservatives, who have held office at the federal level since September 1984, have the most soul-searching to do in the months ahead. In particular, Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister, is expected to give careful consideration to his future. Canadians have developed an intense dislike for him, and his accomplishments - such as the dismantling of restrictive energy policies, the US-Canada free trade agreement and a sharp fall in the inflation rate - have done nothing to endear him to the electorate. In some cases, such as free trade and low inflation, Canadians see his policies not as accomplishments but as a threat to living standards. One of the reasons why voters rejected the Charlottetown pact was that many of them identified it as Mr Mulroney's deal. Unless the prime minister can reverse his poor public image, political observers expect him to come under growing pressure to fall on his sword for the sake of the Conservatives' chances in the next general election.</p>

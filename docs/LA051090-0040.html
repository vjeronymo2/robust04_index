			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHITTIER PUTS BUILDINGS ON HOLD;  </P> <P> COUNCIL TO EXAMINE GROWTH ISSUE BEFORE ALLOWING MORE STRIP MALLS  </P> <P> The Whittier City Council approved a 45-day moratorium on permits for new,  small retail developments and apartment buildings while it examines standards  that could determine the course of future growth in the city.  </P> <P> The moratorium on retail developments of one acre or less is aimed at strip  malls -- those corner shopping plazas noted for doughnuts, dry cleaning, fast  food, video rentals and manicures.  </P> <P> "Nobody needs these things anymore," Council member Helen Rahder said.  </P> <P> "It's better to have a few good (developments) than 100 sleazy things," she  said, prompting applause from dozens of supporters at the Tuesday night council  meeting. Rahder and Bob Henderson, the council's newest members, ran for office  on a platform of controlled growth.  </P> <P> "The purpose of the moratorium," Henderson said, "is not to stop building but  to set standards."  </P> <P> "We've got to allow free enterprise," Council member Myron Claxton countered.  "We can't restrict that."  </P> <P> "I don't see how what you want can be done in 45 days," said council member  Robert Woehrmann, who, like the other incumbents, worries that limits on  development could stifle Whittier's growth.  </P> <P> Even a moratorium, he said, "would still make an impact on the ownership and  development community."  </P> <P> Later, he said it is not the council's business to determine how many pizza  parlors could open in Whittier.  </P> <P> Despite their misgivings, the other council members joined Rahder and Henderson  in passing the moratorium unanimously.  </P> <P> The council also approved a similar freeze on the building of apartments.  Henderson said developers should build apartments that blend with established  neighborhoods rather than buildings that "might as well be a warehouse."  </P> <P> The new standards are likely to permit fewer apartments per parcel and require  developers to provide more parking, landscaping and open space.  </P> <P> City Manager Thomas Mauk said drafting comprehensive guidelines for new  apartments would take at least three months. Under city law, a moratorium can  last only as long as 45 days without a public hearing.  </P> <P> Setting standards for apartments does not promise to be nearly as contentious  as the struggle to control the future of retail development, in particular the  proliferation of strip malls.  </P> <P> One development that will be placed on immediate hold is a proposed Blockbuster  Video store at the corner of a strip mall at Beverly and Norwalk boulevards.  The congested intersection already contains three small shopping plazas and is  next to a residential area.  </P> <P> "I don't think any of us would look at that development with pride," Henderson  said.  </P> <P> Because such plazas occupy less than an acre, they escape review processes in  place for larger developments. Henderson said another strip mall, at Hadley  Street and Milton Avenue, might never have survived such a review. He noted  that the narrow parking lot contained far too few parking spaces for the number  of customers the tenants would need to remain in business.  </P> <P> "That place is a piece of work," he said.  </P> <P> "Things are sliding through that weren't meant to be," Rahder said. "With so  many vacant lots since the earthquake, there's a chance of something nasty  going in."  </P> <P> Since the October, 1987, earthquake and aftershock, there have been 156  residential demolitions, at least 65 directly attributable to quake damage,  according to planning department records. Wreckers also knocked down 138  commercial buildings. Of these demolitions, 68 became necessary because of  quake damage.  </P> <P> In other cases, owners tore down buildings rather than face the high cost of  repair. And some developers also took advantage of emergency demolition  measures to clear off structures.  </P> <P> Rahder said the strip malls endanger the city's own rehabilitation master plan  because they saturate the market with retail office space and compete with  downtown areas that the council seeks to revitalize. "We're biting off our nose  to spite our face," she said.  </P> <P> A leading mini-mall developer sees it differently. "I'm curious why a city that  has had an earthquake would not want to rebuild its tax base," said Samuel  Bachner, the president of the Los Angeles-based La Mancha Development.  </P> <P> His company specializes in building small shopping plazas, to the amount of  $200 to $300 million a year, Bachner said. "I think it's going to continue to  grow as California grows. People have a need for goods and services."  </P> <P> Bachner said the malls provide jobs, conveniences, affordable retail space and  even identity to an area. He sees no problem with quality control. "They all  get what they ask for," he said.  </P></p>

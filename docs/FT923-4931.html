			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Michael Page falls to Pounds 1.3m Pre-tax profits of Michael Page Group, the recruitment agency, fell from Pounds 2.09m to Pounds 1.29m for the half year ended June 30. Turnover was virtually static at Pounds 21.3m. Although the directors do not envisage any improvement in trading conditions, the interim dividend is held at 0.6p, payable from earnings of 1.36p (2.13p) per share. Operating profits of the UK executive recruitment businesses rose marginally, primarily as a result of increased market share. Operating profits in France and the Benelux countries fell by 40 per cent and 45 per cent respectively following a significant downturn in employment markets. The German subsidiary, established in July 1991, traded at break-even.</p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Texas Instruments to Cut Jobs: Texas Instruments Inc. said it plans to cut up  to 1,500 jobs, mainly in the United States, citing a slowdown in demand for its  computer memory chips. The cut would represent a reduction of slightly less  than 3% of its U.S. work force if all the cuts came in the United States. The  company said it would take a pretax charge against earnings of about $55  million in the fourth quarter.  </P></p>

			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Bowater buys rest of MiTek BOWATER, the packaging, printing and building materials group, has, through Rexham, its US subsidiary, paid Dollars 55m (Pounds 36m) for the remaining 44 per cent stake in MiTek, the builder's hardware supplier. Mr Michael Hartnall, finance director, said Bowater always intended to take over the Missouri-based company after it bought a 49 per cent interest in 1987 and another 7 per cent in 1989. The group decided to exercise its call option on the remaining equity when it expired in December. Mr Hartnall said MiTek was the leading North American supplier of metal connector plates, used in timber construction, and complemented Bowater's activities in the construction industry. Operating profit was estimated at Dollars 14.5m on turnover of Dollars 127m in the year to end-December, and its net assets of Dollars 45m included Dollars 20m cash. MiTek has not been consolidated in Bowater's results because it controlled only 49 per cent of the voting rights. Bowater reported an increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds 52.5m to Pounds 62.4m in the half-year to June 1992, with market forecasts that at year-end profits would improve from Pounds 113m to between Pounds 145m and Pounds 155m. A fifth of sales, worth Pounds 1.27bn in 1991, is derived from North and South American operations.</p>

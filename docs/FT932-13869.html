			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Losses threaten ferro-silicon operation ELKEM, THE Norwegian light metals producer, warned yesterday that it might have to wind up production of ferro-silicon unless the division halved losses during 1993 and moved into profit in 1994. The warning was issued in an internal group publication by Mr Arnfinn Holaas, head of the ferro-silicon division. 'We must reduce the division's 1992 deficit by more than 50 per cent in 1993, and we must book a profit in 1994. If we can't do this, we must face the inevitability of winding up this segment of Elkem's operations,' Mr Holaas said. However, an Elkem official explained yesterday that the warning was too strong in a translation of the report from Norwegian into English. He said that what the company meant was that it might have to phase out various segments of the ferro-silicon division gradually unless goals were achieved and to this end the group was diligently continuing cost-cutting and efficiency improvement measures. The group's annual ferro-silicon production capacity is 450,000 tonnes, but its present output is at about 70 per cent of that rate, compared with 65 per cent in 1992. The group claims to be the western world's largest producer of ferro-silicon, with this production comprising 19 per cent of group sales in 1992. Last year Elkem's ferro-alloys division, which includes the ferro-silicon operations, reduced pre-tax losses to NKr422m (Pounds 40m) from NKr458m a year earlier, but sales fell to NKr4.066bn from NKr4.262bn. Group net losses rose to NKr616m in 1992 from NKr443m in 1991 while sales fell by NKr514m to NKr7.4bn. Elkem said along with weak ferro-silicon market prices, there was distinct over-capacity in domestic production. The group has long been seeking co-ordination of production with a small domestic ferro-silicon producer which has so far refused to co-operate. According to the Commodities Research Unit, ferro-silicon prices were 48 per cent below their 1988 peak at the beginning of this year, despite showing a small increase in 1992.</p>

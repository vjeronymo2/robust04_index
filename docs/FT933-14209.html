			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Markheath shares dip on news of delay in results SHARES in Markheath, the property group 61 per cent-owned by the Australian Adelaide Steamship and its associates, fell 1 1/4 p to 5 3/4 p yesterday on news that it was to delay the announcement of its annual results. Mr Ian Creber, finance director, said that negotiations with the group's banks were continuing, causing the delay. These talks have been going on since at least the January announcement of the half-time results, when losses deepened to Pounds 4.71m (Pounds 459,000). Mr Creber said that then the discussions were over the availability of credit facilities; now they were about their maturity dates. He said that rental income was 'not enough to cover the group's operating costs and bank interest. Markheath's financial restructuring, involving repair to the balance sheet, is complicated by the fact that the directors believe, having studied management accounts, that net assets have fallen below Pounds 15.26m, or less than half of the called-up share capital. Mr Creber insisted that this fall-off in net assets - from Pounds 55m at March 31 1992 - did not trigger the delay in the results announcement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Takashi Onoda, chairman of the Marine and </F> Fire Insurance Association of Japan, and president of Sumitomo  Marine and Fire Insurance Company, by economic news reporter  Haruyuki Aikawa; second in three-part series of interviews with  key industrial leaders in priority sectors under negotiation as  the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, entitled: "The  Japan-U.S. Economic Framework Talks: My Arguments"; place and  date not given]    [Text] [Aikawa] What is your impression of the framework  talks?    [Onoda] We still cannot understand why insurance has been  taken up as a priority area. The share of foreign insurance  companies in Japan is 4.2 percent, while the Japanese share in  the United States is merely 0.1 percent. The framework talks  are supposed to deal with the issue of reducing the Japanese  surplus. In insurance, Japan suffers from a huge deficit. We do  not understand what the United States wants.    [Aikawa] The United States is asking for a market share of  more than 10 percent.    [Onoda] Insurance policies are chosen by the individual and  institutional clients. There can be no compulsion. In Japan,  three-fourths of policies are individual ones, the remaining  ones institutional. To achieve a share of more than 10 percent  immediately, we have to give them half of the institutional  insurance policies. That is impossible.    [Aikawa] There should be more sales efforts on the part of  U.S. companies.    [Onoda] Some U.S. insurance companies which entered the  market immediately after World War II, such as AIU, now have  sales in Japan comparable to leading Japanese life insurance  companies. For example, the American Family Insurance, which is  well-known for cancer insurance, makes more sales in Japan than  in the United States. A greater market share can be achieved  through corporate efforts.    Moreover, Japan is an open market which gives foreign  insurance companies national treatment. On the contrary, the  United States has different systems in individual states, and  there is discrimination against foreign companies. Our company  has not even been granted a license in some states. If you go  by the principle of two-way negotiations, it is the United  States that needs to make improvements.    [Aikawa] The United States is opposed to deregulation in  third sector insurance, such as nursing care insurance, where  both life and non-life insurance companies are eligible to  participate.    [Onoda] The third sector, which lies between life and  non-life insurance, is an area where some U.S. companies are  relatively strong. It is totally self-serving to ask for  liberalization on the one hand, while attempting to keep the  regulations in areas where one has an advantage.    [Aikawa] There is also criticism against "keiretsu" [a group  of closely affiliated companies] transactions.    [Onoda] While there are indeed instances of mutual  shareholding, this makes up a negligible portion of the whole  industry. We make arduous marketing efforts under free  competition, and an overwhelming proportion of our business is  from outside the "keiretsu."    The concept of insurance is very different in the United  States. In the United States, insurance companies accept  insurance at a low premium. But once there is an accident, the  premium immediately goes up, or the companies refuse to accept  insurance. In contrast, the principle of Japanese insurance  services is stability, continuity, and security. While the  premium may be a little higher, a client would choose a Japanese  company from the long-term point of view. It is important for  U.S. insurance companies to also conduct followup visits, and  adopt some Japanese business practices to gain the clients'  trust.    [Aikawa] What do you want the government to do?    [Onoda] We hope this issue will not be brought to the summit  conference table and be subject to a bold political settlement.</p>

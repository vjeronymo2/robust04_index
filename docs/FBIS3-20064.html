In a communique, the ministry praised the mediating efforts  of the special United Nations envoy and of neighboring countries  and expressed the hope that the Nairobi accords "will facilitate  the rapid re-establishment of conditions of greater trust and  agreement" and "institutional solutions" that may keep Somalia  united.    Italy will remain present in Somalia through its diplomatic  seat and its development aid efforts and will take part in the  country's reconstruction process, "as soon as conditions allow,"  said the ministry.    The agreement calls for "voluntary disarmament" and a  national reconciliation conference in May to elect a president.  It also repudiates all forms of violence as a means of  resolving conflicts and calls for a meeting of Somali factions  in Mogadishu on April 15 to set up rules and procedures for  voting and criteria for participation in the reconciliation  conference.    The reconciliation conference will allegedly elect a  president, vice president and prime minister for Somalia.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Tentative signs of financial upturn for English football clubs English football is showing tentative signs of a financial upturn with most clubs cutting their losses or moving into profit, according to accountants Touche Ross. The firm's annual survey of football club accounts, published today, shows average operating profits in the Premier League more than doubled to Pounds 1.46m (Pounds 620,000) in the 1992-93 season. Increased income from television contracts and commercial sponsors also helped reduce average losses per club in Division One from Pounds 423,000 to Pounds 332,000; while sides in Divisions Two and Three cut their losses from Pounds 380,000 to Pounds 47,000 and from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 54,000 respectively. Although the figures represent an improvement over the previous season, the survey shows that more than half the country's clubs continued to operate at a loss. Only 43 per cent of clubs were profitable at the operating level and losses at several exceeded their total turnover. Senior football executives also expressed concern that transfer fees - the main source of income for most clubs - had fallen back to Pounds 73m (Pounds 75m), while almost Pounds 200m still needed to be spent improving the country's stadiums to comply with the Taylor Report recommendations on ground safety. Mr Roger Alwen, chairman of Charlton Athletic - which reported losses of Pounds 1.57m in 1992-93 compared with a Pounds 35,000 profit in the previous year - warned that declining transfer income and refurbishment costs could force some teams out of the Football League. 'I think there will be a fall-out of clubs in the next few years. Only around 50 clubs may survive on a full-time basis.' His concern was echoed by Mr Colin Sandy, finance director at Tottenham Hotspur, which is controlled by Mr Alan Sugar. Mr Sandy warned that clubs with insufficient gate receipts and no outside backing 'would go to the wall'. In the Premier League, several leading clubs incurred significant losses. Blackburn Rovers made pre-tax losses of Pounds 6.37m (Pounds 7.93m) and Chelsea and Wimbledon both lost more than Pounds 1m. Touche Ross said the success of Manchester United, which made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.2m (Pounds 5.06m), demonstrated that clubs had to develop commercial activities off the field in order to survive.</p>

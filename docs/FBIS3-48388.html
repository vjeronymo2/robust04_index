"We can deliver our own position on the matter and seek  Washington's support from the perspective of cooperation on  criminal matters," Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong said  Saturday, suggesting that Seoul may oppose issuance of a  residency permit.    The embassy in Washington has been instructed to formally  confirm reports that Kim has asked for a residency permit,  commonly called a "green card."    Kim, chief aide for diplomacy and national security under  President No Tae-u, went to the United States in April last year  as a guest researcher at the heritage foundation. Just few  months after departure, an investigation implicated him in the  taking of massive bribes in connection with the "Yulgok  (military modernization)" project.    Hong said the government learned about a week ago of Kim's  application for a green card.    "We will consult with the Justice Ministry in deciding what  to do, if we need to ask for U.S. cooperation," he said. "But  canceling Kim's passport is not an option under consideration."</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Letter: Why Lamont's removal from office was just (2) Sir, In his defence of Mr Norman Lamont, Bill Robinson writes that 'his senior colleagues agreed that the ERM debacle was not his fault', and that other countries 'have not found it necessary to change their finance ministers along with their ERM parity'. The difference from other countries is that, shortly before the exchange rate was floated, quite a few billions of Britain's foreign exchange resources were spent on buying sterling at a rate some 10 to 15 per cent higher than that which has ruled in the market ever since. Responsibility for exchange rate policy, including intervention, rests with the Treasury and the Bank of England, chiefly the former. It was for being the person responsible, at least formally, for incurring such huge losses that Mr Lamont had to go. If in some way it was not actually 'his fault', whose was it? In a democracy we should be allowed to know. Peter Marks, 23 First Avenue, Westcliff-on-Sea, Essex SS0 8HS</p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Union link faces radical reform WHEN Mr Neil Kinnock was elected Labour leader in 1983 he celebrated afterwards with several union chiefs. At the small gathering to celebrate Mr John Smith's election, there was not a single union general secretary present. Not too much should be read into that. Mr Smith had the enthusiastic endorsement of all main union leaders, is on good terms with them, and does not favour a complete break in the institutional links between party and unions. But the fact that Mr Smith cannot include any union leaders among his close friends - with the possible exception of Mr John Edmonds of the GMB general union - and has not been dependent on them for his victory gives him an uncluttered hand in the debate on union links. His acceptance speech on Saturday indicated that he wants reform of the relationship. He reiterated his support for 'one member, one vote' for the selection and reselection of MPs and confirmed that the union block vote at Labour annual conferences is a target for abolition. Mr Smith, like many others in the party and the unions, wants to escape from a policy-making process dominated by phantom millions of union members. He wants to 'individualise' the union-party link and strengthen local co-operation while reducing the high-profile, undemocratic national links epitomised by the block vote and the electoral college. He is therefore attracted to the idea, floated by the GMB, of converting some of the 5m union members who pay the political levy - often through inertia - into 'associate members' of local constituency parties. Such members would pay a little more than levy payers but less than ordinary members - perhaps Pounds 5 a year. Union delegations at Labour's conference would then reflect only the number of associate members they had recruited and would also be able to split on issues according to how the associate members split. If, say, 1m of the 5m levy payers became associate members, it would also help the party's financial plight. On Saturday, union leaders agreed to increase the levy from Pounds 1.60 a head to Pounds 1.70, but were more cautious about a proposal for an increase to Pounds 2.15 over the next four years. Some unions want to see what emerges from the committee examining the party-union link, expected to produce a provisional report early next year, before deciding on long-term funding. With the exception of the TGWU, most of the big unions are prepared to contemplate significant reforms, although some - such as the AEEU engineering and electrical union - see the associate-member plan as too complex. 'We want to complement, not dominate,' says Mr Tom Sawyer of Nupe, the public-services union. Neither the unions nor Mr Smith want a complete break. Some of the new leader's shadow cabinet colleagues believe he has hitherto been too timid. Mr Edmonds talks of a 'new constitutional settlement' but also warns of a possible backlash from unions if their influence is cut too much.</p>

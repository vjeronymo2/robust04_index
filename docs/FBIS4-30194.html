			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Korean People's Heroic Struggle in Defence of Their </F> National Dignity" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  comes out with a by-lined article entitled "Heroic Struggle of  Our People in Defence of Dignity of Their Country".    The just-born People's Army and people of Korea could win  over the world's reactionary Allied forces in the fatherland  liberation war because they fought an all-people heroic  struggle, only believing in the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese struggle and  ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, and closely  rallied behind him, the article says, and goes on:    The Korean people, above all, rose as one in the war of  justice and fought valiantly in hearty response to the militant  call of the party and the leader "Everything for victory in the  war!"    It was their unfailing loyalty to the party and the leader  and high patriotic zeal that made the Korean people rise as one  for victory in the fatherland liberation war when a grave danger  befell their country and nation due to the imperialist  aggression.    The entire people took arms instead of hammer and sickle,  pen  and book and enthusiastically volunteered to the front with a  resolve to fight it out to the last drop of their blood.    The officers and men of the People's Army defended every  inch  of the fatherland at the cost of their blood by displaying  matchless mass heroism, upholding orders of the respected leader  with their whole heart.    Many heroic soldiers including hero Yi Su-pok ensured  victories in fierce battle with the enemy by dedicating  themselves to silence the enemy's pillboxes and destroying tanks  and warships.    All the people in the rear, workers, peasants, students, the  old and the young, fought heroically for wartime production and  aided the front, not yielding at all even under the barbarous  bombings by the enemy, and creditably ensured victory in the  war, overcoming all hardships and difficulties, united firmly as  one.    In particular, in the enemy-held areas, people organized  guerrillas, young people formed young guards, and children  children's guards to fight against the U.S. imperialist  aggressors.    The Korean people and People's Army could so fully display  mass heroism and the spirit of patriotic devotion in the  fatherland liberation war because they firmly believed that they  would always emerge victorious when they fought as indicated by  the leader, cherishing deep down in their hearts the justice of  the line, strategy and tactics laid down by the great leader  Comrade Kim Il- song and the wiseness of his leadership.    The enormous significance of the fatherland liberation war  lies in that it strikingly demonstrated the fact that the  strength of a people united firmly behind their party and leader  is inexhaustible and nothing can break it.    Now, the Korean people and People's Army are firmly united  behind respected supreme commander General Kim Chong-il, an  ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, ideologically  and purposefully and In-moral obligation.    They will as ever firmly unite behind the party and the  leader and wage an all-people heroic struggle, thus smashing  whatever maneuvers of the imperialists and firmly defending and  further glorifying the Korean-style socialism.</p>

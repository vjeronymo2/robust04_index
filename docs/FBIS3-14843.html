He believes the resolution of the political and economic  amnesty is "the right and timely act. It does not flare up a  civil war. It is those who are trying to stay in power."    Ilyukhin said that according to the Russian Constitution  adopted at the referendum on December 12, the adoption of the  act on amnesty is the prerogative of the lower house of  parliament and "the president, and the Federation Council have  nothing in common with it. [no end quotation mark as received]    Speaking about the resignation of the Russian Prosecutor  General Aleksey Kazannik, Ilyukhin said that he made a premature  step. "If he really wants to guard legality and order, he must  not resign but implement the decision of the legislative body."    The State Duma, believes Ilyukhin, will confirm the act  again, since most deputies voted for it.    By his actions the Russian President has confirmed again  that  he had never respected the old Constitution and will not respect  the new, presidential Constitution, said Ilyukhin.</p>

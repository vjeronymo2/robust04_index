			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Chrysler in Dollars 100m plan for Vietnam Chrysler, the US motor manufacturer, is planning a Dollars 100m joint venture in Vietnam to build minivans and possibly four-wheel drive vehicles. The venture would be the first by a US carmaker since the lifting of the US economic embargo on Vietnam earlier this year. The negotiations come as other international vehicle makers are considering projects in the country, in spite of difficulties in finding local partners with experience in the industry. Mr Robert Eaton, the Chrysler chairman, arrived in Hanoi on Tuesday to meet Mr Vo Van Kiet, prime minister, and the transport and heavy industry ministers to discuss the project. The company's interest in Vietnam follows an early entry into the China market, where production of the Beijing Jeep began in September 1985. In May, Mitsubishi Motors became the first Japanese carmaker to enter a joint venture in Vietnam, quickly followed in June by Renault, the French state-owned group, which signed a letter of intent to begin car assembly in the country. BMW, the German carmaker, has a contract to assemble cars in Vietnam and Mercedes-Benz hopes to do the same. Vietnam is eager to avoid domination of its motor industry by one country and has yet to decide how it will divide up shares of the motor assembly and manufacturing industry. In Chrysler's case, industry sources suggest that the joint venture partner is most likely to be a division of the heavy industry ministry rather than a Vietnamese motor manufacturer. Until two months ago, Chrysler was pursuing negotiations with Mekong Corporation, a three-way venture between Japan, Korea and Vietnam, to build a four-wheel-drive vehicle. However, the deal apparently fell through when the Korean partner made clear it was unwilling to relinquish sufficient equity control to Chrysler. Since then, the US company has been hunting for other partners, determined to set up some sort of facility in Vietnam. It was reported yesterday that the company had already decided on a site for the venture. If Chrysler wanted to sell domestically it would have to find a way round recent foreign currency regulations stipulating that revenue from any product sold in Vietnam must be in dong, the local currency, which is not freely convertible. As an emerging market, Vietnam is viewed with great interest by several leading vehicle makers. Less than 5 per cent of the country's 72m people drive cars.</p>

Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=44 g=1 f=1 --> September 20, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On April 12, 1994, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange''), pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') a proposed rule change to list and trade Market Index Target-Term Securities (``MITTS''), <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  the return on which is based upon a portfolio of securities of health care companies (``Health Care Portfolio''). <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  Notice of the proposal appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on April 28, 1994. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change.

See Letter from James Buck, Senior Vice President and Secretary, NYSE, to Sharon Lawson, Assistant Director, Office of Market Supervision, Division of Market Regulation, Commission, dated August 9, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of the Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Section 703.19 of the Exchange's Listed Company Manual (``Manual''), the NYSE may approve for listing securities which can not be readily categorized under the listing criteria for common and preferred stocks, bonds, debentures, and warrants. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  The NYSE is now proposing under Section 703.19 of the Manual to list for trading MITTS based on the Health Care Portfolio (``Health Care Portfolio MITTS''). <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 29229 (May 23, 1991), 56 FR 24852 (May 31, 1991); and 28217 (July 18, 1990), 55 FR 30056 (July 24, 1990'') (``Hybrid Approval Orders''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recently approved the listing and trading on the Exchange of MITTS based upon (1) a global portfolio of securities representing telecommunications companies, and (2) a portfolio of European companies. See Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 32840 (September 2, 1993), 58 FR 47485 (September 9, 1993); and 33368 (December 22, 1993), 58 FR 68975 (December 29, 1993) (``MITTS Approval Orders''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As with the other MITTS products, the Health Care Portfolio MITTS will conform to the listing guidelines under Section 703.19 of the Manual, which provides that: (1) Issues must have a minimum public distribution of one million securities; (2) a minimum of 400 shareholders; (3) a minimum duration of one year; (4) a market value of at least $4 million; and (5) otherwise comply with the NYSE's initial listing criteria. <FOOTCITE>9</FOOTCITE>  In addition, the Exchange will monitor the Health Care Portfolio MITTS to verify compliance with the Exchange's continued listing criteria. <FOOTCITE>10</FOOTCITE>  MITTS are non-callable senior hybrid debt securities of Merrill Lynch that provide for a single payment at maturity, and will bear no periodic payments of interest. Health Care Portfolio MITTS will entitle the owner at maturity to receive an amount based upon the percentage change between the ``Original Portfolio Value'' and the ``Ending Average Portfolio Value,'' subject to a minimum repayment amount. The ``Original Portfolio Value'' is the value of the Health Care Portfolio on the date on which the issuer prices the Health Care Portfolio MITTS issue for the initial offering to the public. The ``Ending Average Portfolio Value'' is the average of the values of the Health Care Portfolio at the end of the five calendar quarters preceding the expiration of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS on December 31, 1999. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  The Ending Average Portfolio Value will be used in calculating the amount owners will receive upon maturity. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 9 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The hybrid listing standards in Section 703.19 of the Manual are intended to accommodate listed companies in good standing, their subsidiaries and affiliates, and non-listed equities which meet the Exchange's original listing standards. Domestic issuers must also meet the earnings and net tangible assets criteria set forth in Sections 102.01 and 102.02 of the Manual. Specifically, the minimum original listing criteria requires that issuers have: (1) 2,000 holders holding 100 shares or more or have 2,200 holders with an average monthly trading volume of 100,000 shares; (2) a public float of 1.1 million shares; (3) an aggregate public market value of $18 million or total net tangible assets of $18 million; and (4) earnings before taxes of $2.5 million in the latest fiscal year and earnings before taxes of $2 million in each of the preceding two fiscal years, or earnings before taxes of $6.5 million in the aggregate for the last three fiscal years with a $4.5 million minimum in the most recent fiscal year (all three years are required to be profitable). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 10 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The continued listing criteria for capital or common stock requires that: (1) The number of holders of 100 shares or more is equal to or greater than 1,200; (2) the number of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than 600,000; (3) the aggregate market value of publicly-held shares is equal to or greater than $5 million; (4) the aggregate market value of shares outstanding (excluding treasury stock) is equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000; and (5) net tangible assets available to common stock are equal to or greater than $8 million and average net income after taxes for the past three years is equal to or greater than $600,000. In addition, the continued listing standards for bonds require that outstanding publicly-held bonds have an aggregate market value or principal amount equal to or greater than $1 million. See Section 802 of the Manual. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Specifically, the Ending Average Portfolio Value will equal average of the quarterly values of the Health Care Portfolio beginning in the calendar quarter ending December 31, 1998. The quarterly value for each of the first four of the final five calendar quarters shall be the Health Care Portfolio value on the last scheduled Exchange trading day on which there is no market disruption event. The quarterly value for the final calendar quarter shall be the Health Care Portfolio Value on the seventh scheduled Exchange trading day preceding maturity of the Health Care MITTS unless there is a market disruption event in which case the sixth trading day preceding maturity shall be used. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Health Care Portfolio MITTS will entitle a holder at maturity to receive for each $10 principal amount of MITTS an amount equal to the Ending Average Portfolio Value of the Health Care Portfolio divided by 10, but in any event no less than $9 per each $10 principal amount of Health Care Portfolio MITTS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the market value of the portfolio has declined, the owner will receive not less than a specified percentage of the principal amount of the security. (For instance, if the market value of the portfolio used to calculate the amount payable at maturity has declined more than 10%, the owners of the Health Care Portfolio MITTS will receive 90% of the principal amount of the securities.) The payment at maturity is based on changes in the value of the portfolio, but does not reflect the payment of dividends on the securities that comprise the portfolio. Health Care Portfolio MITTS are cash-settled in that they do not give the holder any right to receive a portfolio security or any other ownership right or interest in the portfolio securities, although the return on the investment is based on the aggregate portfolio value of the Health Care Portfolio securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to the NYSE, Health Care Portfolio MITTS will allow investors to combine the protection of a portion of the principal amount of the MITTS with a potential additional payment based upon the performance of a portfolio of securities representing 22 highly capitalized health care companies. Health Care Portfolio MITTS will mature on December 31, 1999. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

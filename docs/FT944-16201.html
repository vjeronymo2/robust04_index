			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Observer: Legal eaglet Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal-Democrat party economics spokesman, yesterday pooh-poohed UK chancellor Kenneth Clarke's claim of being financially prudent. Bruce knows all about prudence; as an insurance against possible future income loss he's just started training as a barrister. With a majority of 274 at the last election, and boundary changes threatening his seat, he is - prudently, you might say - looking around. Bruce has told fellow Bar students that Paddy Ashdown, the Lib Dem leader, is unhappy with his legal studies. So are some of Bruce's fellow-students, tired of hearing him announce 'I must get back to the House'.</p>

			<p><P> July 21, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATION BLACKS OUT DORNAN SO POTENTIAL FOE CAN'T ASK EQUAL TIME  </P> <P> Los Angeles radio station KFI-AM, which has featured Rep. Robert K. Dornan  (R-Garden Grove) filling in for nationally syndicated talk-show host Rush  Limbaugh this week, blacked out Dornan's show Friday.  </P> <P> A KFI spokesman said the station decided to air alternate programming because  of unanswered questions about whether Barbara Jackson, Dornan's Democratic  opponent in the Nov. 6 election, might have the right to demand equal time on  the air.  </P> <P> Jackson withdrew from the Democratic primary in the 38th Congressional District  in March, saying that she did not want her campaign to create a conflict with  her job as an official with Planned Parenthood of Orange and San Bernardino  counties.  </P> <P> But she won the primary anyway. She said then that she would not campaign  against Dornan and that she did not consider herself a candidate. But her name  is still slated to appear on the November ballot.  </P> <P> Alan Eisenson, KFI's assistant program director, said the station consulted its  lawyers earlier in the week about whether Jackson could legally demand equal  air time under a Federal Communications Commission rule requiring equal access  for political opponents.  </P> <P> The lawyers did not answer until Thursday night, after Dornan had been heard on  more than 240 stations across the country, including KFI (640 AM), for four  days. On legal advice, station manager George Oliva decided that KFI would not  air the fifth show, Eisenson said.  </P> <P> "We're under the impression that Barbara Jackson is not a bona fide candidate,"  Eisenson said. "But we just wanted to be on the safe side. We don't want to  violate the FCC equal-time provision."  </P> <P> Eisenson said the KFI switchboard received 50 to 60 calls from listeners who  were angry or disappointed that Dornan was not on the air -- an unusually high  number of calls for a programming change.  </P> <P> Dornan told The Times that the equal-time question "never should have been an  issue" because Jackson is clearly not a candidate. He said it is too bad that  Los Angeles and Orange County listeners didn't get to hear his most prominent  caller Friday morning, Vice President Dan Quayle. Earlier shows this week  featured calls from President Bush and Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.  </P> <P> Jackson was out of town and could not be reached for comment. But she said  earlier this week that she was told by the FCC that she was entitled to equal  time and would like to use it. She added, however, that she was uncertain what  she would use it for.  </P> <P> Eisenson said Jackson called KFI earlier in the week about the equal-time issue  but did not demand any air time.  </P> <P> "She just wanted to indicate that she was aware she might be entitled to equal  time," Eisenson said. "She was very cordial, very nice. She said she'd look  into it next week."  </P> <P> Eisenson said the station's position is that Jackson does not have the right to  demand equal time because she is not a genuine candidate.  </P> <P> Milton Gross, chief of the FCC's political branch in Washington, said Friday  that Jackson met two of the three criteria for receiving equal time by having  qualified for the ballot and being eligible to hold the office. Whether she  qualifies on a third point, being an announced candidate, is a bit murkier, he  said.  </P> <P> Gross said the FCC has never grappled with an issue like the one posed by  Jackson.  </P> <P> "The only question is, by withdrawing, does this person withdraw the public  announcement?" Gross said. "We have never answered that question and would have  to give it some thought. The station is going to have to make a decision. If  anybody complains, we would take a look at it."  </P> <P> Under federal law, television and radio stations must provide equal time to  opposing candidates whenever a candidate who has qualified for the ballot  appears recognizably on a broadcast that is not a newscast. The opposing  candidates must request such time within seven days of the broadcast.  </P></p>

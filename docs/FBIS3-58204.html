He said today on Hesse radio that  Germany could not avoid concessions within the framework of EU  [European Union] harmonization.    It was "completely unrealistic" to imagine that European  partners would endorse the German Government's political  principles on arms exports drawn up in 1982. Within the EU,  sensible compromises would therefore have to be achieved that  were in line with moral considerations and took account of  international obligations, Bohl said. But there was no question  of this opening the door to unrestricted arms exports, he said.</p>

			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICERS KILL GUNMAN WHEN HE INVADES POLICE STATION  </P> <P> An apparently deranged gunman died in a barrage of bullets at the Montclair  police station Thursday after allegedly taking a secretary hostage, demanding  to talk to the police chiefand the U.S. Marines and firing a shot at a  plainclothes sergeant.  </P> <P> The gunman was identified as Adrian Mark Vasquez, 27. He was a resident of  Montclair, 35 miles east of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Vasquez was killed when six policemen opened fire on him just inside the front  door of the station after he fired a shot from a .38-caliber revolver that  missed the plainclothes officer and smashed through a window, Police Lt. Terry  Gibson said.  </P> <P> "He was dead when he hit the floor," Gibson said.  </P> <P> Members of Vasquez's family said he had "mental problems from . . . drugs" and  that he had told a nephew on Wednesday that he was "going to kill a cop,"  Gibson said.  </P> <P> Vasquez had previously been in trouble with the law for drug and traffic  violations, Gibson said, but details were not available.  </P> <P> Law enforcement authorities said they do not know why Vasquez demanded to talk  to Police Chief Gregory Caldwell or the Marines.  </P> <P> "He was acting incoherently," Gibson said.  </P> <P> The short drama in the neat, white, one-story station on a quiet street began  about 8 a.m. when a police secretary, who was not identified, arrived at work  and was followed by Vasquez through a security door for authorized personnel,  Gibson said.  </P> <P> According to Gibson's account, Vasquez took the secretary hostage at gunpoint  and accompanied her to Caldwell's office, which was vacant. He then demanded  that she phone the chief, as well as the U.S. Marines.  </P> <P> The secretary instead called the police dispatcher, who alerted other officers.  After a brief telephone conversation with Caldwell, who was in a conference  room in another part of the building, Vasquez stepped into the hall, saw a  plainclothes officer and fired a shot at him.  </P> <P> Vasquez then walked through the security door, saw more officers, raised his  revolver and was cut down in the lobby by police gunfire, Gibson said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDED BY KING HEROD'S SON, IT WAS HOME TO 15,000;  </P> <P> METROPOLIS UNCOVERED IN GOLAN HEIGHTS  </P> <P> U.S. and Israeli archeologists have unearthed a Roman metropolis that in its  heyday was the ancient world's equivalent of New York.  </P> <P> Founded in about AD 10 by Herod Philip, son of King Herod the Great, ancient  Baniyas grew over the next several hundred years "into a huge city,"  archeologist Vassilios Tzarferis of the Israel Antiquities Department said  recently.  </P> <P> "We can estimate the population in Roman times of up to 15,000 people, which  for those days means it was a New York," Tzarferis said.  </P> <P> Traces of ruined villas can be found a mile from the city center, he said.  </P> <P> Herod Philip chose the site near the source waters of the Jordan River and next  to a cave where pagans worshiped Pan, the goat-like god of the shepherds. The  cave is part of a national park that today is a favorite site for picnics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Named for Emperor  </P> <P> He named his city in honor of Emperor Augustus Caesar, but it became known as  Caesarea Philipi to distinguish it from the port of Caesarea constructed by his  father on the Mediterranean Sea.  </P> <P> American teams working at the site this year have partially uncovered a dozen  30-foot-high arches that formed one side of what appears to be a long shopping  mall, said John Wilson, an archeology professor from Pepperdine College in  Malibu, Calif.  </P> <P> The arches now are the bottom layer of a wedding cake of history. Wilson said  Crusader conquerors 1,000 years later built a citadel on top. In the 13th or  14th Century Mameluke raiders from Egypt added a palace.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Syrian Village on Top  </P> <P> "On top of it all was a Syrian village," Wilson said. Baniyas was part of Syria  until the Golan Heights region was taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war  and annexed in 1981.  </P> <P> Diggers have uncovered a public gate dating to the 1st Century and a 2nd- or  3rd-Century house with mosaic floors, one of which is largely intact.  </P> <P> Wilson said "we are encouraged there may be considerable sections of ancient  Baniyas that are preserved." But he estimated that it would take up to 10 years  with as many as 100 people working each digging season to expose a substantial  part of the city.  </P> <P> Historians and archeologists had many clues to the city's location, Wilson  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Depicted on Coins  </P> <P> "The Pan cave with niches and inscriptions appears exactly on coins of the 2nd  and early 3rd Century that say they are from Baniyas," Wilson said. "There are  other coins with pictures of buildings, which we feel are as accurate, and  that's what we're looking for."  </P> <P> The area is referred to as "Paneon" by the Jewish historian Josephus, who says  Herod the Great built a white stone temple to Roman Emperor Augustus there.  </P> <P> For years, it was strategically important because it controlled the road from  Damascus to the sea, Wilson said. It lost its importance after Ottoman Turks  took control, he said.  </P> <P> In addition to Pepperdine, the other American colleges that sent students to  work at Baniyas this year were Averett College of Danville, Va., and  Hardin-Simmons University and Abilene Christian College, both of Abilene, Tex.  </P></p>

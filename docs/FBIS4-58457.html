			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz has received an  invitation from his Egyptian counterpart 'Amr Musa to attend the  signing ceremony of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement. It has  not been decided whether Lebanon will respond to the invitation.    Minister Buwayz today discussed developments in the  bilateral  talks in light of the talks that U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher has had in Damascus and other concerned regional  states.    Buwayz expects Christopher's current tour to result in an  invitation to attend the 13th round of bilateral peace talks.  He believes that the proposals submitted to Syria in the past  24 hours are vague, because the Israeli proposal offers phased  withdrawal from parts of the Golan Heights, starting with Majdal  Shams. The proposals do not mention what will happen after  that. Syria, he said, demands full withdrawal.    Buwayz added: I believe that Syria is not very enthusiastic  about these proposals, because it wants to know how withdrawals  will begin and end even if they are phased. From the  information I got from Damascus in the past 24 hours, I got the  impression that these proposals are not tempting. I do not want  to sound pessimistic and say that they are the last proposals.  They will certainly be followed by others. But the first round  of talks in Damascus did not sound constructive according to the  latest reports.    Minister Buwayz said that negotiations continuing for three  years since Madrid have produced few results. The  Palestinian-Israeli track produced the Gaza-Jericho Agreement,  which remains a very modest achievement, he said, adding: This  agreement mentions a 350-km square Gaza and Jericho and gives  the Palestinians rights in municipalities. It involves no  political rights. It also notes that Israeli military troops  will continue to deploy at the entrance to Gaza and Jericho.    The foreign minister was talking to a delegation from the  Netherlands including professors and students from the faculty  of law. The delegation is currently on a tour that will take it  to Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Jerusalem, and Gaza to get acquainted  with the peace process and the progress it has made. [passage  omitted]    As for the Lebanese-Israeli track, the problem looks much  easier than it is. The Israelis say they have no ambitions on  Lebanese land and water. This has remained mere talk in the  media; it has not been interpreted in practical offers or  proposals to withdraw during the ongoing negotiations.    Buwayz added: We propose that Israel announce and bind  itself to the principle of withdrawal from the land it occupies  in the south. This principle paves the way for setting up two  security and military committees to study the necessary security  measures in the south to guarantee peace and stability in the  region simultaneously with the programed Israeli withdrawal. I  believe the Israelis do not want to implement UN Security  Council Resolution 425 because it does not involve a peace  agreement with Lebanon. This resolution demands Israel's  unconditional withdrawal from the Lebanese territory it occupies.    The foreign minister continued: The second reason that leads  Israel to refrain from responding to Lebanon's demands is that  it does not want to recognize the principle of military  withdrawal until Lebanon restricts or suspends resistance  activity. But the Lebanese stance on the Israeli viewpoint is  the opposite; occupation can only be met with one of two things:  Diplomacy, that is, implementing Resolution 425, or liberation  by the army. Israel refuses the first approach and the United  Nations has not put pressure on it to accept it. As for the  second approach, the Lebanese Army is not militarily prepared to  confront the Israeli army.    Hence the resistance was organized by the Lebanese people,  who are entitled to restore their land as long as the state  cannot do it.    Buwayz reiterated that resistance in the south is a result  of  the Israeli occupation. It will lose its justification once the  occupier leaves, he said.</p>

This places Mexico third in  world drug trafficking control. However, this ``noticeable''  level of interdiction prompted the proliferation of ``drug  pushers,'' especially along the northern border, who have  triggered hard drug consumption where there was none before.    Miguel Angel Gonzalez Felix, Human Rights and Drug  Trafficking coordinator of the Foreign Relations Secretariat,  pointed out that we are running the risk that drug trafficking  money, which will eventually be ``laundered,'' could enter the  Mexican financial system thanks to trade opening.    As for the U.S. State Department's International Drug  Trafficking Control Report disclosed last week, the official  said that the Mexican fight against drug trafficking is  currently taking place without any pressure from the United  States. He added: ``It is a more balanced struggle due to  President William Clinton's efforts to fight local consumption,  not foreign production.'' [quotation marks as published] As he  emphasized that our country's fight against drugs is due to  internal reasons, Gonzalez criticized the report, which  indicated that 50 percent of the drugs coming into the United  States enter through our territory.    He stressed that at the beginning of the current six-year  presidential term, the detection and interception of cocaine  failed to reach 10 tons; during the last few years, however,  drug seizures amounted to about 50 tons annually. The report  should state the opposite: ``Thanks to the efforts of Mexico,  the amount of cocaine that enters the United States has been  curtailed by one fifth. Should we look at it from this  viewpoint, it would be exactly the opposite.'' [sentence as  published]    We increased drug seizures from 10 to 50 tons. Should we  take into account that drug interdiction amounts to 100 tons at  the U.S. border, 60 tons in Colombia, and 50 tons in Mexico, and  that Spain, among the European nations, intercepts the most  cocaine, 10 tons, then the detection level will indeed be ``very  noticeable.''    Gonzalez admitted that one of the big problems with the  interdiction policies is the proliferation of ``drug pushers.''  Although there is no widespread and serious drug consumption at  the border, it is a problem that worries authorities  nonetheless, because it is a situation ``we never thought we  would have to deal with.''    The diplomat [title as published] added that another problem  that Mexico could face in view of the free trade is money  /laundering/, which could emerge at the same time as the market  opens. This is an issue that the Finance Secretariat and the  Attorney General's Office have already began to work on. The  interdiction systems were more vulnerable to drug trafficking  money prior to the opening, but these mechanisms are currently  being strengthened to ensure that ``ill-conceived money''  operations could be foreseen, detected, and controlled.    Gonzalez said that this is a vanguard issue on the American  continent; Europe and Asia do not have to deal with this problem  despite their open markets. He insisted Mexico is at the  vanguard.    The so-called U.S. report on our country on the drug issue  is  secondary for the official. What is really important is the  Clinton administration's shift to concentrating more on local  consumption aspects, not on the cooperation systems of other  nations. It is not that we want to praise his job, but we could  say that the most praiseworthy part of it is the change Clinton  made with regard to local drug consumption. ``They are  channeling more resources to their consumption problem; they are  also realizing that although the strategies that they  implemented in the past indeed diminish drug inflows to the  country, said strategies generated a number of unexpected  conflicts.''    This does not mean that the United States will drop  international cooperation programs altogether. The official  maintained that cooperation systems with Latin America and  Mexico still prevail, but they are now very respectful of the  nations' sovereignty.    The United States is tackling these problems, as Mexico has  done for many years, from an integral viewpoint that will combat  not only production and trafficking, but also consumption.    Does this mean the United States is exerting less pressure  on  us?    The situation changed when President Clinton came to power.  It is very respectful of sovereignty, and this makes us have  fewer conflicts and more expeditious cooperation.</p>

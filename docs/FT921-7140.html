			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Company News: SA leisure group net ahead 15% to R213.3m KERSAF Investments, the South African leisure and entertainment group, overcame deteriorating trading conditions to record a 14 per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of December. Turnover rose 13 per cent to R1.02bn (Dollars 357m), and operating income was 10 per cent higher at R274.98m. A lower tax bill, due to heavy capital expenditure at the group's Bophuthatswana hotel operations, helped lift net profits by 15 per cent to R213.3m. Earnings attributable to outside shareholders, however, also rose, thus restricting attributable earnings to R86.4m, a 14 per cent rise. Mr Buddy Hawton, executive chairman, said the results were satisfactory in the light of difficult conditions and the susceptibility of the group to a slowdown in consumer spending. Kersaf's main investments are a 80 per cent stake in the Sun International casino resort and hotel group, and a 38 per cent stake in Interleisure, which is involved in the leisure and entertainment fields. Sun International performed well during the period, with casino revenues 25 per cent higher than during 1990. This was due in part to the opening in November of the Carousel resort. In line with the rest of the industry, however, hotel occupancies declined, by 4 percentage points to 66 per cent. Mr Hawton said Interleisure's performance had been satisfactory, with cinema attendances picking up after a slow start, and buoyant trading at Computicket, the entertainment booking outlet. Looking ahead, he said depressed economic conditions were expected to continue for the rest of the year. Earnings growth, however, should be satisfactory if conditions did not deteriorate further. The dividend was lifted by 14 per cent to 66 cents per share, on a similar rise in earnings to 115 cents per share.</p>

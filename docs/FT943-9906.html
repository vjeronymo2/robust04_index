			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / Athens firm on airport strike Greece's Socialist government yesterday refused to bow to pay demands from air traffic controllers, who are disrupting flights with a go-slow. Foreign tourists have faced long delays at Athens airport since May, mainly because of the protest by 500 controllers. Mr Theodoros Pangalos, transport and communications minister, told the controllers' union in a letter: 'I will agree to fresh talks on condition you drop your demand for pay rises in 1994 and 1995. I will not grant one drachma beyond inflation and nothing will make me change my stand. The claim would bring pay from Dr600,000 (Pounds 1,629) a month to Dr1m.' He said he was considering transferring air traffic controllers to the defence ministry's jurisdiction, where security considerations would make conditions tougher.</p>

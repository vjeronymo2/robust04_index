Subsequently, the Commission reexamined the feasibility of implementing rate regulation by June 21, 1993 in view of the significant additional responsibilities imposed on the Commission by the Cable Act of 1992 and a severe funding shortfall faced by the Commission at that time. We extended the freeze until November 15, 1993. Our regulations establishing rate regulation of cable service became effective September 1, 1993. However, those regulations were subject to reconsideration. Because the rate regulations were pending reconsideration, by early November, 1993, the Commission had received applications for certification from local franchising authorities representing less than 20 percent of communities that may regulate the basic service tier. Accordingly, on November 10, 1993, the Commission further extended the freeze on regulated revenues until February 15, 1994. We stated that, where local governments already have initiated rate regulation of the basic tier, we were not concerned that rates for the tier could raise to unreasonable levels after November 15, 1993. We noted that in the initial freeze order, we determined that a freeze on rates for the cable programming services tier was necessary to prevent operators from evading the freeze by moving programming from the basic to the cable programming service tier. We concluded in the Nov. 10 Extension Order that it was unnecessary to continue the freeze for cable programming service tiers where the basic tier has become subject to rate regulation. Accordingly, we amended the rule to make clear that the freeze would no longer apply to regulated cable services provided by cable operators whose basic cable service has become subject to rate regulation by a local franchising authority or the Commission. As a result, the number of cable systems subject to the freeze decreases as franchising authorities become certified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> III. Discussion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 4. As of January 31, 1994, the Commission had received 4,896 applications for certification from local franchising authorities covering approximately 7,534 communities served by cable. Although these figures for certifications are significant increases from the last time we extended the freeze, they still represent only a small percentage of the nearly 30,000 communities that are potentially eligible to regulate the basic service tier. We continue to believe that it is important to provide franchising authorities and other affected parties sufficient time to become familiar with any modifications to our rate regulations before the freeze is lifted. We expect to act on reconsideration by the end of this month, and we believe that it is important that the statutory goal of ensuring reasonable rates not be undermined in the interim. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Administrative Procedure Act requires that new substantive rules be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at least 30 days prior to their effective date. In the event that we adopt any substantive changes to our rules on reconsideration, we anticipate that such revised rules would be released approximately 30 days after adoption and that these regulations would be published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  within 15 days thereafter. In addition, we will be adopting rules addressing issues raised in the Third Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, 58 FR 46737 (Sep. 2, 1993). Thus, under this schedule, any new regulations adopted would become effective approximately 75 days after adoption. Extension of the freeze for that period of time is the minimum amount of time required to enable the Commission to adopt modified rules, should it choose to do so, and for such rules to become effective before the freeze is lifted. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

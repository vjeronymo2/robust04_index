			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: France The short term economic logic for floating the franc is increasing as inexorably as the pressure on the foreign exchange markets. The surge in French bond and share prices yesterday reflects the growing conviction that interest rates will have to come down by one means or another. Paris financial markets assume either that the Bundesbank will buckle next Thursday and reduce rates - a seemingly unlikely prospect - or that a franc float will enable France to cut the cost of borrowing. Yesterday's increase in money market rates suggests the authorities are determined to tough it out. The government has mobilised a panoply of market tactics as well as the heavy artillery of intervention while the franc is still more than a centime above its D-Mark floor. At present, there is a solid political consensus behind the policy. There are no psychological deadlines, such as elections or referendums, to force a resolution of the issue. Though battered, the franc could remain in the fight for some time to come. Such a policy, though, would be unsustainable if it meant market interest rates remained high and fed through into bank lending rates. With unemployment nudging 12 per cent, the clamour for some economic stimulus would grow shriller. The privatisation programme, which was finally unleashed this week, would also be jeopardised. Domestic investors, unsettled by job insecurity, would be loath to switch out of safe money market funds. Overseas investors would be nervous about buying shares denominated in a vulnerable currency. Both would worry about the dismal outlook for corporate earnings.</p>

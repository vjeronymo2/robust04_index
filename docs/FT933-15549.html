			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Actions stations at Christchurch AS THE announcement of the by-election date trickled down to Christchurch yesterday, the local political parties were not the only people to swing into action, Gillian Tett writes. At the Chef Peking Chinese restaurant, next to the Christchurch Conservative Club, a cut-price campaign menu was on offer. But with the outcome of the election still uncertain, the restaurant has tactfully avoided any predictions. 'We're throwing in some wine so that way they can either celebrate or commiserate,' said Mr Mike Allen, of the Chef Peking. At the civic centre, a group of local businesspeople have already formed a committee to find ways of cashing in on the media circus expected to hit Christchurch soon. And as the first television cameras swooped into the town yesterday locals were already buzzing with anticipation. 'Normally people round here don't talk a lot about politics,' said Mrs Eileen Stephens, owner of a sweetshop. 'But this time there's a lot of talk, a lot of moaning and groaning.' Although Christchurch is dominated by pensioners, many of whom are traditional loyal Conservatives, many yesterday admitted that they were increasingly wavering in their vote. 'I have always voted Tory but I won't this time. They've messed everything up,' said pensioner Mr Gilbert Smith. Mr Bernard Saxton, who had also voted Tory all his life, echoed the complaints: 'I am hoping the Liberal Democrats will win.' At Liberal Democrat headquarters in a former car showroom, the mood was cautious as scores of party workers stuffed leaflets into envelopes and attempted to set up a campaign in an area where the party traditionally has had a low profile. 'We are going to have to fight very hard to win,' said Mrs Diana Maddock, Liberal Democrat candidate. 'We cannot be complacent.' At Conservative party headquarters, where a bevy of Central Office workers have been shipped in to boost the campaign, Mr Rob Hayward refused to predict the outcome of the election. Others will not be so reticent. Until polling day Christchurch will be a natural home for pundits. The voters will end the speculation on July 29.</p>

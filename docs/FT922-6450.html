			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Food: Elizabeth David - Obituary IT IS hard to convey just what Elizabeth David, who died in her sleep at home yesterday, came to mean to the post-war generation of Britons who were starved of sunshine, warmth and alternatives to roast beef and cabbage. Born in 1913, one of four daughters of Rupert Sackville Gwynne, MP, and Stella Ridley, her interest in food was first awakened by a girlhood stay in a greedy Parisian household. Later, she vividly evoked in her writing the intense pleasure and excitement that sensitively produced food could convey. Its contribution to the warmth and well being of a people, its proper roots in the culture of a nation that she first observed in France came to be the mainspring of her life's work. When A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in 1950 it brought to a still-rationed Britain not just some seductive recipes - cassoulets, bouillabaisses, ratatouilles - but an evocation of a warmer, more sensual way of life. It was this instinctive feeling for authentic food, for its relationship to the country, the seasons, the people, coupled with a scholarly approach and a controlled romanticism in the prose, that made her books both authoritative and readable even to those who never lifted a saucepan. French Country Cooking (1951), Italian Food (1954) and Summer Cooking (1955) followed, each as scholarly, each as evocative of time and place as Mediterranean Food, and each still meriting permanent places on the bookshelves of any serious cook. The end of her life was marred by ill health and she became an increasingly awesome figure, difficult to communicate with but scholarly to the end. My last communication from her came a few months ago in the form of a crisp little letter, ticking me off for referring, as I had jokily done, to 'rustic cooking pots from the Ardennes.' 'There are no rustic cooking pots from the Ardennes - they are made in the Auvergne.' Her authority, her feel for simplicity coupled with a dislike of pretension, are the qualities that will make sure that her books will be with us long after her beloved France is more renowned for Big Macs than bouillabaisse.</p>

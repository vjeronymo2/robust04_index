			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / Survey of Software at Work - Winter 1993 (21): Goodbye to dusty box files - Leeds University helps in environmental study / Ready accessibility of the system has enabled researchers in different areas to integrate and share information When Leeds City Council wanted tourist information and an environmental study, it turned to the local university, writes Claire Gooding. Leeds University, regarded as one of the top GIS establishments in the academic community, has plenty of experience in integrating data from different sources. It has given rise to the GMAP organisation of around 60 GIS specialists, which undertakes commercial projects. With limited resources, and a Macintosh environment, the choice of a GIS was limited. Geo/Navigator was chosen for its flexibility - 'we needed to 'hang' data on an existing structure,' says Jim Harbidge, a PhD researcher involved in Leeds' environmental study. 'It was ideal because it could take in any sort of data.' Ease-of-use is a great advantage, and Mr Harbidge says that the ready accessibility of the system has enabled researchers in different areas to integrate and share information in such a ways that they can benefit from one another's findings: 'In the old days, it would have meant a search through box-files.' Many different authorities apart from the local Leeds Council have an interest in the geographical data gathered by the GIS team, including the National Rivers Authority and Yorkshire Water. Based on a Macintosh Centra, the system has no problems connecting with other computers, and back-up is done on a Sun Unix computer. Mr Harbidge adds: 'It's easy to get data in, from over the road - or from California. The GIS is a tool not just for specialists but for environment and management - a general tool to enable people to see their assets on a spatial scale.'</p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: Expanding company audits Sir, The recommendation of the working party of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales ('Companies may have to review internal controls', October 2) relating to the proposed audit of internal financial controls adds fuel to the debate about the statutory obligations of companies to report to shareholders. This emphasis on reviewing internal financial controls may well be justified and certainly accountants would welcome further statutory underpinning of their fee income. But what about other activities and operations in a company? Should there not be a statutory requirement to report on marketing, quality, product development, research and development, manufacturing? Are these not just as important to the health of a company as financial controls and possibly of even greater significance to shareholders and investors? There must be many organisations with sound financial controls which face a difficult future because they do not have the right people or the right strategies. Clearly these sorts of issues are of fundamental importance and need to be dealt with in annual reports in a manner which is meaningful while not giving undue commercial advantage to others. Perhaps non-executive directors should be playing a part? They may be the people to take responsibility for an independent 'health check', reinforced by some statutory realignment of their responsibilities which also protects them with respect to other directors on the board. My self-interest is evident, provided of course such 'health checks' are undertaken by suitably qualified management consultants who are members of this institute. But such self-interest is no worse than that which prevails when the bodies that fulfil a statutory obligation are seen also to influence its scope George Lapsley, president, Institute of Management Consultants, 32-33 Hatton Garden, London EC1N 8DL</p>

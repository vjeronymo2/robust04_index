They are discussing the status of the Baykonur  cosmodrome and the town of Leninsk and conditions for their use.  At the moment the Kazakh side is still refusing to recognize  Baykonur as a Russian military base and is insisting on its  demilitarization, since Kazakhstan's constitution stipulates  that there must not be any foreign military bases on the  republic's territory.</p>

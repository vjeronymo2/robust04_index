Sakigake plans to support the government from outside the  cabinet. New Party Mirai and Jiyuto have recently been formed  by defectors from the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP].    Takemura offered the following comments:    [Begin recording] These matters are confirmed. I agree with  the new administration's intention to continue with and further  the reform efforts undertaken by the Hosokawa administration.  As to particulars about policies, I have my own views regarding  the finer details, but I told Hata I agree in general with the  policies worked out among the coalition parties. [end recording]    The leaders of New Party Mirai and Jiyuto made the following  comments:    [Begin recording] [Michihiko Kano, head of New Party Mirai;  identified by caption] Since we appraise Foreign Minister Hata  for such matters as his basic political stance, I told him we  would give our cooperation.    [Koji Kakizawa, head of Jiyuto; identified by caption] Since  Hata asked for our cooperation, I told him I look forward to  giving him a definite answer after discussing the matter with  lower house members who are my Jiyuto comrades.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Survey of Pakistan (1): Challenging perspective - Pakistan aspires to be a robust export-oriented country and the main land-bridge to the emerging republics of Central Asia. But its hopes are clouded by its economic frailty and political uncertainty HERE is one vision of Pakistan's future: a modern, deregulated, open economy, export-driven and strongly oriented towards the private sector, and the gateway to the emerging republics of Central Asia. This is another: an inward-looking country with few true friends, beset by uncertainty over the role of the military in politics and of Islam in society, strangled by bureaucracy and poor infrastructure, and unable to address chronic weaknesses in economic management. The extraordinary thing about Pakistan is that people can simultaneously entertain both views. The businessman who solemnly recounts the country's woes will then reveal ambitious expansion plans with barely a pause for breath. The visitor is tossed gaily between optimism and pessimism. There is no dispute, however, about the need for action which existed when the government of prime minister Nawaz Sharif was elected in October 1990. The political system was in disarray. The economy was in dire need of reform. Ms Benazir Bhutto, Mr Sharif's predecessor, had begun to reverse the public sector domination created by her father's nationalisation of big industry and banks in 1972. But her attempt foundered as President Ghulam Ishaq Khan removed her from office in 1990 after only 20 months in office, amid allegations of corruption. Mr Sharif, a private sector industrialist who had been chief minister of Punjab province, immediately embarked on a headlong drive to open up the economy, which he continues to pursue with vigour. His finance minister, Mr Sartaj Aziz, explains: 'What we are doing is to bring about a major structural change to contract the government in those areas where it is not very good at doing things and shift it to those areas where it is supposed to do things and which it can do better.' Businessmen have seen the first results. Thanks to the elimination of licensing, they no longer have to waste months or years in trips to Islamabad, the capital, to seek approval (or the infamous No Objection Certificate) from powerful bureaucrats for any investment decision. The government's programme to extricate itself from running industries is well advanced. It has sold 55 of 115 targeted industrial units, and two of the big five banks, and has begun to open up utilities to the private sector. Most exchange controls have been lifted, as well as most barriers to foreign investment. 'Our total package is now more liberal than almost anywhere in Asia,' says Mr Aziz. The government has liberalised imports, started to cut tariffs, and deregulated interest rates and loans. Accompanying these measures are ambitious plans to improve infrastructure with new highways, power plants and telecommunications networks and improved railways and ports. The final plank of reform is to improve social conditions. Though Pakistan has enjoyed a healthy economic growth rate, levels of poverty and illiteracy are typical of those in much poorer countries, and the population growth rate is among the highest in the world. The government has announced a programme to improve drinking water, literacy and health care. By the expiry of the government's term in 1995, Mr Sharif says: 'We will have visible achievements which will speak for themselves. We will not have to launch an election campaign.' The overall reform programme is radical and rapid even at a time when many other countries are making similar attempts to slough off bureaucracies and bloated, loss-making public sectors. 'It is a very bold step that Mr Sharif has taken, doing away with all the norms that we were used to,' says Mr Yusuf Shirazi, chairman of Atlas Group, an industrial and financial services conglomerate. Pakistan has a dynamic private sector, which ought to provide the basis for strong export-led growth as privatisation and deregulation take hold. Foreign investors, however, have proved slow to respond. Though the Karachi Stock Exchange has seen portfolio buying, direct investment has been limited mainly to foreign multinationals already familiar with Pakistan or smaller companies linked with Pakistanis overseas. Several political and economic concerns prompt this caution. Pakistan's political institutions provide the basis for a stable democracy, but its record still gives rise to lingering uncertainty about who really rules the country. The elected government, itself a coalition of several parties, co-exists uneasily with the other two members of the so-called 'troika' - the president and the army. Mr Sharif, mindful that the previous government was dismissed by President Ishaq Khan, can never be totally sure of his authority, even though there is little serious opposition to economic reform. There is little sign of any impending presidential intervention and the army, though playing an influential role behind the scenes, is thought unlikely to take direct political steps as it has in the past. Apart from precluding cuts in defence spending, which accounts for over a third of the budget, the constraints upon the government create doubts about how vigorously it can attack some chronic weaknesses and stand firm against powerful vested interests. For example, Pakistan has an astonishingly inefficient tax structure which leaves significant parts of the economy, notably farmers, effectively free of direct tax. The budget deficit is the most pressing economic problem, and the government has failed by a wide margin to meet targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund for its reduction. Mr Aziz has begun a campaign to reduce tax rates but broaden the net and improve collection, but some businessmen feel this has produced inconsistencies without addressing the real problems. One economist asks: 'Is the government prepared to impose costs on the private sector at the same time as giving them a lot of benefits?' Other concerns are more obvious: bureaucrats, though their power is being reduced, still take what opportunities they can to slow things down; infrastructure will take years to build, though improvements have begun with, for example, a big rise in new telephone lines; rampant lawlessness in the southern province of Sindh, though reduced by a recent army crackdown, could be a worry when the army withdraws. A further cloud over investment prospects is a ruling of the Islamic Shariat court outlawing 'riba', which essentially means interest payments. Pakistan's banking system has already adapted domestically, developing alternative accounts and payment mechanisms, but there is doubt about whether this is sufficient to meet the court's ruling. International borrowings, such as vital aid flows from donor countries, would also be thrown into question. Though the government's appeal against the ruling will be heard later in the year, Mr Sharif has shown reluctance to take a clear stand for fear of upsetting political support. He was elected on an Islamic platform and is linked on streetside hoardings with General Zia ul-Haq, who led Pakistan on an Islamic path during 11 years of rule until his death in an air crash in 1988. The issue is the key test of the extent to which Pakistan wishes to follow a fundamentalist Islamic road. It appears uncertain: there are few signs of widespread popular support, but most politicians are unwilling to offend the mullahs. Behind uncertainties over the role of the military and of Islam lies a more fundamental issue: what should be the thrust of foreign policy? One reason for the influence of the military is that Pakistan remains in a state of constant alert on its eastern border with India, and faces continuing turmoil - in which it is seeking to act as intermediary - in Afghanistan along its long north-western border. Though Islamabad has at times had close relations with Washington, they are currently cool, with the US Congress barring new direct aid because of Pakistan's nuclear programme. Mr Sharif has begun a drive to open political and trade links with the new states of central Asia, but this will depend on an enduring peace in Afghanistan, through which trade routes must pass. In the longer term, tensions with India are perhaps the greatest impediment to progress. Solution of the Kashmir problem would allow Pakistan and India to channel large-scale resources away from defence, to target new export markets, and to move ahead unfettered by the problem which has dogged them both since birth. That is a massive challenge for Mr Sharif, his Indian counterpart PV Narasimha Rao, and their successors.</p>

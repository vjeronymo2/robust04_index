			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Survey of World Automotive Suppliers (2): Outlook remains bleak - West European car production is falling sharply WITH the west European new vehicle market in deep recession, forecasts for demand are becoming more gloomy month by month. Carmakers see little sign yet of the steep fall in sales, suffered in the first half of the year, coming to an end. West European new car sales plunged by 17.9 per cent in May, the fifth successive month that demand had fallen steeply from the corresponding period a year ago. In the first five months alone more than 1m fewer new cars were sold in west Europe than in the same period a year ago with sales dropping by 17.3 per cent to 5.15m according to industry estimates. The harsh picture in the European car market is also reflected in the commercial vehicle sector, where sales are estimated to have fallen by 25 per cent year-on-year in the first three months. As each new forecast deepens, the industry's pessimism about the immediate outlook, carmakers appear to be reaching a consensus that west European car sales in 1993 could drop to a level as low as 11.4-11.6m from the 13.5m achieved last year, a decline of at least 14 per cent. The long years of strong sales have come to a more abrupt end, than even the pessimists had feared. New car demand in west Europe bounded from one record year to another during the second half of the 1980s with sales jumping from 10.17m in 1984 to 13.47m in 1989. For another three years from 1990 to 1992 demand held steady around the record level of 13.5m. Beneath the deceptively calm surface, however, all was not well as demand trends began to diverge greatly in key markets. Sales in the UK slumped by a third from the 1989 peak with the early onset of recession, while an unprecedented surge in new car sales took place in Germany, Europe's biggest market, in the wake of unification. The German car market jumped from 2.8m in 1989 to 4.2m in 1991 and held at 3.9m last year. The German party has ended, however, with sales dropping by around a fifth in the first five months this year, and the UK has become virtually the only market across west Europe, where new car sales are currently rising. Sales were lower than a year ago in 15 of 17 markets across west Europe in the first five months of the year. In Germany, sales in the period fell year-on-year by 20 per cent, in Italy the decline was 21.1 per cent, in France 18.5 per cent and in Spain 31.2 per cent. The flickering of recovery in the UK - with sales up by 8.9 per cent this year - pales against declines of this magnitude elsewhere. DRI Europe, the London-based automotive analyst group, says in its latest monitor report in June that 'with European markets in a state of flux' it has been forced to revise downwards its 1993 forecasts with new car demand in Europe now expected to contract by 14 per cent to 11.6m. 'The poor results for April and May have once again renewed fears within the industry about the scale of the downturn now affecting Europe.' West European car production is falling sharply, as manufacturers respond to the deepening recession, but there are still excess stocks. According to DRI 'despite widespread short-time working in the first quarter of the year stock levels are still considered to be on the high side.' It forecasts that west European car production, net of double counting, is expected to fall to 11m units this year, a decline of at least 13 per cent from 12.7m in 1992. 'Sales have dropped so quickly that it has been difficult to cut back line rates with the same vigour. Consequently, stocks still remain high. The outlook for production remains bleak with widespread extended downtime over the summer holiday expected.' DRI sees only modest prospects for a pickup in sales in 1994 with carmakers and components suppliers having to wait until 1995 for the new car market in west Europe to begin to stage a recovery. Its latest forecast suggests that sales will rise by only 1.7 per cent next year to 11.8m from this year's very depressed level of 11.6m. Demand is forecast to recover more firmly in 1995 and 1996 with increases of around 7 per cent a year, but it will be 1996 before sales finally return to the level of the beginning of the 1990s reaching around 13.55m. Demand is forecast to continue rising during the late 1990s to 14.86m in 1998. The current weak level of demand is expected to persist next year largely as a result of a continuing contraction of sales in both Germany and Italy, the two biggest European car markets. Demand in Germany is forecast to fall from 3.9m last year to 3.17m this year and to only 3m in 1994. DRI forecasts that new car sales in Italy will fall from 2.37m last year to 1.94m this year and to 1.89m in 1994. 'There are increasing concerns over the future direction of the German economy with the current downturn in the market not expected to turn around before 1995,' says DRI. The pace of the decline in west Europe is the most striking feature of the present development of the new car market worldwide, and is the chief factor behind the expected contraction in worldwide new car sales this year to 33.3m from 33.9m last year. World sales peaked at 35m in 1990. Despite an unconvincing start to the year, car sales in the US have begun to pick up in April and May. In the first five months sales have risen by 2.7 per cent after a lack-lustre performance in 1992, when car sales rose by only 0.4 per cent to 8.2m. DRI forecasts that demand will strengthen in the remainder of the year with sales rising in the full year by around 8 per cent to 8.9m. The main surge of activity in the US in the last 18 months has come in the light truck market, where many vehicles are bought as alternative passenger transport. While car sales stagnated last year, light truck sales jumped by 12.4 per cent to 4.67m and accounted for 36 per cent of the combined car and light truck market. This resurgence, which disproportionately benefits the domestic US industry with GM, Ford and Chrysler dominating the market, has continued in 1993 with truck sales jumping by 17.9 per cent in the first five months. While recovery in North America is gathering pace, the main source of growth in the world market is the Asia Pacific region - excluding Japan where sales are expected to fall again in 1993 for the third year in succession. Particularly strong expansion is forecast in China, Malaysia and Thailand, backed by further significant growth in Taiwan and South Korea. For the whole of the Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, the DRI forecast suggests that new car sales will rise by 21 per cent this year following a jump of 16 per cent last year. Further increases are forecast of around 12 per cent a year in both 1994 and 1995 with sales rising from 2.45m in 1992 to 4.1m in 1996 and 4.7m in 1998.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                        January-December 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Volume     Volume     Share (%)   Share (%)                             (Units)  Change (%)  Jan-Dec 92   Jan-Dec 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET             13,498,484     0.0        100.0        100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen*  (incl.       2,357,931    +6.5         17.5         16.4 Audi, SEAT &amp; Skoda) General Motors            1,679,704    +4.1         12.4         11.9 (Opel/Vauxhall, US &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall           1,628,938    +4.3         12.1         11.6  -Saab**                     50,766    -3.1          0.4          0.4 Peugeot (incl.            1,644,658    +0.9         12.2         12.1 Citroen)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Fiat (incl.

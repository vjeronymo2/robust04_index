Religious groups in Beijing have made contributions to the  capital's economic development and social stability, government  officials said.    Monsignor Michael Fu Tieshan, a member of the National  People's Congress Standing Committee and Catholic bishop of the  Beijing Diocese, on behalf of the religious circle, subscribed  100,000 yuan for the national "Hope Project", which promotes  children's schooling in poor areas.

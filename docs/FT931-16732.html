			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Trinity Insurance accused of 'imprudent' transactions SOME former directors of Trinity Insurance face possible legal action following the collapse of the company last year with net liabilities now estimated at Pounds 55m. In the accounts for the year to December 31 1991 Mr John Winter, who was appointed chief executive of the privately owned general insurance company in January last year, said a series of 'inappropriate' or 'imprudent' investment transactions contributed to losses of Pounds 80.1m in 1991. The accounts show investment losses of Pounds 13.7m in 1991, including several million pounds written off against loans to Panfida, an Australian retailing group now in liquidation, in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation had a 29.9 per cent stake. The accounts come in a document, prepared by Price Waterhouse, provisional liquidators, which advises Trinity's 15,000 policyholders and creditors to approve a scheme of arrangements under the 1985 Companies Act which could lead to a pay-out of between 60 and 70 per cent. The scheme would allow the directors to remain in charge of the company during its winding down under the supervision of an insolvency practitioner, and avoid the need for liquidation procedures, which could delay any pay-outs for many years. Ernst &amp; Young, which became auditors after the new directors asked Pannell Kerr Forster to re-ign last July, said in their report to the accounts that income and expenditure may have been incorrectly allocated between 1990 and 1991, and assets and liabilities misclassified in 1990. It said the directors had told it they believed the 1990 accounts may have been materially misstated and that a number of transactions with people linked to former directors were not disclosed, as the law requires. Trinity's 1991 accounts show exceptional losses of Pounds 26.4m, including provisions of Pounds 5.1m against a guarantee on a loan from Barclays Bank to GFA Holdings, Trinity's parent company. Mr Grant Fowler, a former Australian rules football star, married to a niece of Mr Murdoch, took over Trinity in 1988 but left last January at the request of the non-executive directors. Trinity had traditionally underwritten direct business, but increased its exposure to higher-risk London market and reinsurance business from 1990. Underwriting expenses soared to Pounds 17m in 1991, exceeding 50 per cent of the company's net premium income. In spite of underwriting losses of Pounds 39m that year, Mr Fowler's salary increased by more than 50 per cent to Pounds 557,000. Benefits in kind to directors more than doubled to Pounds 949,065. There were also provisions of Pounds 1.4m to meet tax charges against five houses worth about Pounds 3m bought by the company on behalf of three directors. Ernst &amp; Young submitted a report to the Department of Trade and Industry last year on the regulatory implications of transactions since early 1990 totalling Pounds 20m involving Trinity and Bryanston, another general insurer also in liquidation and also owned by GFA Holdings. No action has been taken to date. Observer, Page 15</p>

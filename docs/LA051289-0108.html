			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KOREAN TAKES SHOW ON THE ROAD -- TO L.A.  </P> <P> When Young-chul Kim, 35, an ambitious producer for the Mun Wha Broadcast Corp.  in Seoul, had an idea for a new show last summer, he didn't realize how  successful it would be.  </P> <P> "MBC Song Festival for Housewives," a weekly variety show contest in which  housewives sing with a live orchestra, has become one of the hottest programs  in South Korea. An estimated 70% of the country's TV viewers watch the show,  according to MBC, which is the only privately owned national TV network in  South Korea.  </P> <P> Now Kim is bringing the show to Los Angeles, where an estimated 600,000 Korean  immigrants live. Sponsored by Korean-language newspapers here, the "MBC Song  Festival for Housewives" is scheduled to be taped live and presented to the  public at the Shrine Auditorium tonight at 7. The recorded program will be  broadcast in South Korea on May 24 as a two-hour special on the MBC-TV network.  </P> <P> The show is designed solely for married housewives who stay home to take care  of their families. After qualifying for the contest at auditions, the  housewives compete against other housewives, singing songs that are mostly  chosen from Korean popular tunes. Not only do they get public exposure on the  show, but they can earn prizes. In the local contest, about $50,000 in prizes  are at stake, including round-trip tickets to Seoul with expenses, fur coats,  and others.  </P> <P> Contestants come from as far away as Tempe, Ariz., and Pemberton, N.J. One of  the local contestants, Mrs. Young-Ok Kang, 27, an L.A. resident for nine years,  says: "When I will be on TV, I think lots of my friends will see me. I'm  already calling my parents and friends in Seoul, telling them that I'll be on  TV." A group of her family and friends bought 50 tickets to root for her.  </P> <P> Mrs. Sun-Young Lim, 28, a Buena Park resident and a college graduate who  majored in music, is looking forward to performing on the same stage where the  Oscar winners stood not long ago.  </P> <P> "Although this is not for American audiences, I am sure those viewers in Korea  will be excited about the Shrine Auditorium. Just being there and standing in  front of my family is important to me," she said.  </P> <P> Traditionally in Korea, whenever a group of people get together, they sing.  Singing with families and friends is part of the culture. In many of taverns in  Korea, if patrons offer a tip they can sing a number with the house band.  </P> <P> Kim has already screened out hundreds of applicants from all over the States,  leaving 12 finalists who will compete at the Shrine Auditorium. Kim and his  camera crews are taping each contestant and interviewing her family members in  order to show the that side of each contestant. Other camera crews are  interviewing relatives and friends in South Korea.  </P> <P> "By participating in this event," Kim says, "one can bring family unity back,  cheering for a wife and mom." Asked why he brought this program to Los Angeles,  he says: "I knew why so many Koreans have come to the U.S.A., since I have a  few relatives in the States, they wanted to have second opportunities in their  lives. Without any second thought, they are so busy making their own economic  success. I thought I have to pay tribute to their hard work."  </P> <P> MBC-TV has sent out 50 staffers, including 20 musicians for an orchestra, and  popular entertainers as special guests. Chang-Sik Lee, deputy director of MBC  Entertainment, says: "We will determine other future programming in foreign  countries (depending) upon success in L.A. for "MBC Song Festival for  Housewives."  </P></p>

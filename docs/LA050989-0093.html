			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen seven straight days and investors  and institutions are sitting on the sidelines trying to determine what the  future portends, according to Irving Katz, director of research for Thomas  Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Elliott Wave guru Robert Prechter, who partially predicted that the  market would move up during the 1980s, now has joined the "gloom- and  doom-sayers" who are forecasting a severe depression, Katz said.  </P> <P> San Diego stocks remained oblivious, however, with nine stocks recording new  yearly highs the past week.  </P> <P> Price Co. responded to pressure from analysts and shareholders by dropping a  planned new class of convertible preferred stock. Price instead will issue a  one-time $1.50 cash dividend. The stock reached a new high of $43.50 and gained  $2.25 for the week.  </P> <P> Other new highs were attained by Mail Boxes Etc., $19; PS Group, $37.25; BSD  Bancorp, $8.875; First National Corp., $17.375; Beeba's Creations, $11.75; DH  Technology, $10.50; Maxwell Laboratories, $13.50, and PSICOR, $11.75.  </P> <P> Good gains were also made by Molecular Biosystems, up $1.50, and Monitor Labs,  which gained $.50.  </P> <P> The only new low for the week was made by Gen-Probe at $2.875.  </P> <P> Annual meetings this week include Titan Corp. today and Medical Imaging Centers  of America on Thursday.  </P></p>

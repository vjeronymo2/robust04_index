			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft disappoints METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German mining and industrial group, yesterday reported 1991-1992 pre-tax profits down by nearly a quarter and signalled its gloom about the future by saying that it is proposing a dividend cut from DM10 to DM8 per share. Group profits for the year ended September sank by 23 per cent to DM245m (Dollars 163.3m), the second consecutive year that the profits have fallen sharply against a background of falling metals prices. Last year profits sunk 35 per cent from DM483m in 1990, but the dividend was maintained. Turnover rose by 20 per cent to more than DM20bn, the increase reflecting the company's purchase late last year of businesses from Stora of Sweden, mainly Buderus and Dynamit Nobel. Excluding these acquisitions, turnover rose by three per cent. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive, blamed the downturn on a combination of factors which hit the metals businesses especially hard. These included falling prices, the adverse effect of currency movements and the costs of upgrading facilities to make them more friendly to the environment, he said. The figures imply a sharp downturn in the second half of the year, since at the six month stage profits were flat at DM162m with the company expecting satisfactory figures for the full year despite difficult conditions. Yesterday Mr Schimmelbusch said that profits for the current year were likely to remain at around the same level as in 1991-92. He defended last year's acquisition from Stora, which cost DM1.45bn. The businesses were performing extremely well and there was no way that this had put Metallgesellschaft under financial strain: net indebtedness was nil, he said.</p>

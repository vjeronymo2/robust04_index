			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Tony O'Reilly lifts his stake in Arcon to 23% MR TONY O'Reilly, chairman of the Heinz food group, has increased his personal stake in Arcon, an Irish exploration company, by 1.4m shares to 13m shares, equivalent to 23 per cent of the ordinary capital. The deal was done through Colombia Investments, Mr O'Reilly's holding company. Together with parties he is deemed to be acting in concert with, he now controls 29.99 per cent of the company, the maximum permissible without being obliged to mount a formal takeover bid. Arcon, formerly Conroy Petroleum, has discovered a 6.2m zinc/lead ore deposit at Galmoy in Ireland, which, once developed, is anticipated to be one of the lowest-cost zinc mines in the world. Over the past year it has been the subject of a bitter boardroom battle between Mr Richard Conroy, the chairman, and Outokumpu, a 22 per cent shareholder. Mr O'Reilly was seen as a white knight by Mr Conroy, when the former first took a 5 per cent stake through a IPounds 7.7m share-swap offer for Mr O'Reilly's ailing Atlantic Resources exploration company. Mr Conroy believed Outokumpu was planning a takeover and wanted 100 per cent control of the ore marketing. The move cost Mr Conroy his place on the board last February, but he was reinstated a month later when Mr O'Reilly took a further 16.3 per cent. Mr O'Reilly is estimated to have spent some IPounds 10m to date in building his holding in Arcon.</p>

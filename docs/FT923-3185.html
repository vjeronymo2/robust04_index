			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Deflationary effects of Japan's domestic difficulties JAPAN'S current account surplus spells danger for the world economy, but not for the reasons US politicians would have us believe. The surplus is a product of the changed international pattern of Japanese capital flows that has resulted from Japan's domestic financial problems. It is the deflationary consequences of Japan's long-term capital surplus and short-term capital deficit, rather than unfair competition from Japanese companies, that should be worrying US and European policymakers. Japan's current account surplus has been rising since 1990. Depressed domestic demand for imports and a surprisingly robust export performance have increased the surplus, in dollar terms, almost to its peak level of the mid-1980s. The surplus, measured in Ecus, more than doubled between 1990 and 1991, as the table shows. Yet while Japan's current account surplus looks familiar, the capital flows which finance this surplus are very different. The balance of payments must, by definition, balance: any surplus on the current account must be offset by a deficit on the capital account. But today's capital flows take a different form from five years ago, with different implications for the world economy. Japanese capital provided the oil which smoothed world economic growth in the second half of the 1980s. The flow of funds into Japan from its net export earnings was offset by an outflow of long-term capital - foreign direct investment, bonds and securities - as Japanese institutions responded to low domestic interest rates and financial deregulation by expanding their international portfolios. Japanese banks increased the value of their international assets by 200 per cent between 1985 and 1990. The outflow of long-term capital from Japanese investors and companies exceeded the earnings on the current account, as the upper chart shows. The balance of payments balanced because the short-term capital account was also in surplus. Japanese banks used a portion of the short-term foreign currency deposits they obtained from international investors to fund their lending to domestic Japanese companies. The rapid growth of Japanese business investment was, in part, financed by a net short-term capital inflow. The collapse of Japan's 'bubble' economy and the ensuing difficulties of the financial sector have reversed these capital flows. As the current account surplus began to rise, the long-term capital account also moved into surplus in 1991, for the first time since 1980. Japanese investors have reduced their international portfolios while foreign investors have increased their holdings of Japanese equities. And the flow of Japanese foreign direct investment has been sharply curtailed. Japanese FDI was Dollars 30.7bn in 1991, against Dollars 48bn in 1990. The combined current and long-term capital account surplus since 1991 has been matched by a short-term capital outflow. But this time the outflow has had a contractionary, rather than expansionary, effect on world financial markets. Japanese banks, burdened with non-performing domestic loans and required to meet the Bank of International Settlements capital-asset ratios by next year, have pulled in their horns. The short-term capital outflow results from banks' efforts to reduce their stocks of foreign liabilities, as the lower charts show. The latest BIS annual report showed that the decline in gross international banking activity last year was fully accounted for by a 9 per cent contraction in Japanese banks' balance sheets. The global supply of new credit has effectively ground to a halt as a result. But the problems of Japanese banks are far from over, despite the recent stock market rally. Until their bad debts are cleared from their balance sheets, they are likely to remain cautious about new lending. Throw in the effects of heavy personal and commercial sector debts in the US and UK, and high interest rates across Europe, and the outlook for the world economy remains decidedly deflationary.

Imports can be derived by subtracting the visible trade balance from exports. Export and import data are calculated on the FOB (free on board) basis, except for German and Italian imports which use the CIF method (including carriage, insurance and freight charges). German data up to and including June 1990, shown in italics, refer to the former West Germany. The nominal effective exchange rates are period averages of Bank of England trade-weighted indices.

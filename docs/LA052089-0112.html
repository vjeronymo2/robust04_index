			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN TOLD TO BUY MORE U.S. CHIPS;  </P> <P> FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO '86 PACT MIGHT BRING MAJOR PENALTIES  </P> <P> A U.S. official warned Friday that Japan might face additional penalties if  there is no increase in sales of American semiconductors in Japan.  </P> <P> "Proper implementation of (a 1986) agreement would result in the addition of  billions of dollars worth of U.S. sales here," said the official, who spoke on  the condition that he not be identified, after two days of talks with officials  of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.  </P> <P> Asked if the United States would consider such a sum as "damages" for use in  calculating penalties on Japanese sales to the United States, the official  replied that there had been no "detailed discussion of expectations."  </P> <P> But he added, "We would see that the failure to implement the market access  provisions of the agreement is a very serious and important commercial matter,  and it is something that affects billions of dollars of potential U.S. sales."  </P> <P> </P> <P> List Due May 30  </P> <P> Up to now, the United States has imposed $165 million in penalty tariffs on  Japanese imports for Tokyo's failure to live up to its pledge to expand  American chip sales here.  </P> <P> A decision by U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills to condemn Japan as an  unfair trading nation in semiconductors would not lead to new negotiations but  rather to talks on enforcing provisions of a Sept. 2, 1986, agreement on  semiconductor trade. Hills is to announce a list of unfair trading partners May  30.  </P> <P> The U.S. official said officials of the Ministry of Trade had warned that  branding Japan as unfair on semiconductors would be "counterproductive."  </P> <P> "We said we would take their view back to Washington, but we didn't discuss it  further," he said.  </P> <P> Japan, the official went on, was making "constructive efforts." He said that  some progress had been achieved, citing plans that individual Japanese  companies have worked out, under Trade Ministry guidance, to increase purchases  of American chips, and agreement by Japanese firms to work with American makers  to design chips for their use.  </P> <P> But he said "the United States continues to be highly dissatisfied with  implementation of the market access provisions."  </P> <P> </P> <P> American Share About 10%  </P> <P> According to Data Quest, an American semiconductor data firm, in the last three  months of 1988 American semiconductor sales to Japan amounted to $540 million  -- more than double the $248 million in the three months before the agreement  went into effect Sept. 2, 1986.  </P> <P> But the American share of the expanding Japanese market is still only about  10%, the U.S. official complained. In the last three months, he said, the  American share has declined slightly.  </P> <P> "The U.S. share in the market remains below levels that would reflect  competitiveness of U.S. firms," he said. The official refused to specify what a  proper level would be.  </P> <P> He dismissed as unfounded Japanese charges that American chip makers had failed  to make an effort to sell here. But in response to a question from a Japanese  reporter, he admitted that fewer than 10 companies, all of them small, would be  joining an American sales mission to Japan in June.  </P></p>

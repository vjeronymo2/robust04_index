There was also renewed violence in the Gaza Strip. Mark Weiss  reports:    The clashes at various locations in Hebron erupted this  morning after the Army announced a two-hour lifting of the  curfew to enable residents to stock up on basic supplies.  Hundreds of residents joined the violent protests, and  17-year-old Usamah Mustafa Ghazal was shot and killed by Army  fire, and at least another 14 were wounded, two of them  seriously. Witnesses report that a second resident, 18-year-old  Nidal al-Hammumi, has also died of his wounds, but this has  still not been confirmed by hospital sources.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1200 GMT on 2 March  reports: "In Jericho, soldiers shot and killed 'Uthman 'Ali  Bargham, 20, and wounded 22 local residents in the most violent  riots the city has experienced in many years." The report adds  that "several masked men incited the masses in a mourning  procession in the city today. The marchers began to riot,  attacking the police station, at which point the troops were  forced to open fire."]    Clashes continued in Gaza city and the refugee camp of  Jabalyah this morning. At least 20 residents were wounded,  according to Palestinian sources. The curfews in towns and  refugee camps in the Gaza Strip were lifted today, although the  schools remained closed.    The closure imposed following the Hebron massacre remains in  force. The curfews on major population centers in the West Bank  remain in place, although there are frequent reports of curfew  breaking and isolated clashes with troops.    Two border policemen were lightly wounded in stone-throwing  clashes today, one in Ramallah and one in Gaza.</p>

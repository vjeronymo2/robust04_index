			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / World Trade News: Caribbean energy sell-off generates keen interest / Review of various governments' efforts to divest state electricity interests Two US companies have agreed to purchase a 49 per cent stake in Trinidad and Tobago's state-owned power company for Dollars 112m (Pounds 76.7m). It is the largest transaction in the efforts of several Caribbean governments to sell their electricity companies, once considered the preserve of the state. Southern Electric International of Atlanta, Georgia and Amoco Business Development, a subsidiary of the Chicago oil company, are concluding the details of one of the larger privatisations in the region. The new investors will be responsible for operating and maintaining the generating facilities which provide electricity for the country of 1.2m people. The Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission has installed capacity of 1,178MW and generates just over 600MW, which is adequate for existing demand. There was, however, a growing need for additional generating capacity to be installed by 1996 if reliable power supply was to be guaranteed, said Mr Barry Barnes, Trinidad and Tobago's energy minister. To meet this schedule, the Trinidad company needs Dollars 90m-Dollars 125m, which it is unable to raise. Many other governments in the Caribbean are shedding their public power companies, anxious that they will become millstones, weighing heavily on already weak budgets. Most public energy companies are getting out of the business of generating, and some are becoming regulatory bodies overseeing the private companies which are taking over. The expansion and diversification of Caribbean economies over the past decade has left many state-owned power companies unable to keep up with demand, and without the resources to provide energy reliably and at acceptable rates. Frequent increases in the cost of power has reduced industrial competitiveness, while financially pressed governments have not been able to raise funds for expansion. Governments, under pressure to be fiscally prudent, have been unable to continue financing the deficits of the power companies and along with other state enterprises they have been offered for divestment. Indicative of the plans for the region's state-owned power companies is the plan by the Dominican Republic to restructure the Compana Dominicana de Electricidad and sell parts of it to private foreign and local companies. The company has been unable to meet the national demand for electricity of about 1550MW. The CDE's rated capacity is 1350MW, but output has fallen to as low as 540MW in recent years, and is now at just over 950MW, mainly because several plants have fallen into disrepair. Proposals for restructuring the country's electricity system involve splitting the CDE into three sections, responsible for generation, transmission and distribution. Transmission facilities will remain under government ownership, while power plants and distribution networks will be sold. Rates will be determined by the market, with generators selling to distributors while paying a fee to the government for using the transmission facilities. The changes will coincide with the inauguration of an expansion in installed capacity which should exceed demand and end shortages caused by plant breakdowns. All new generating capacity in Jamaica will be constructed and operated by private foreign and local companies as the first part of the government's move to divest and deregulate the Jamaica Public Service Company. The first of this is a 60MW plant under construction by US and local investors, and which is to be commissioned by 1996. It is part of a Dollars 160m programme by the World Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank to expand power generation and promote local and foreign private investment in the power industry. The Jamaican government has not yet determined which aspects of the power company's operations will be divested. The Grenada government is negotiating with WRB Enterprises of Florida which wants to buy a half of the island's state-owned power company. The Guyana Electricity Corporation is listed among several companies which the government wants to divest. There is, however, increasing interest in tapping the country's significant hydro power potential. The government is considering the construction and operation by foreign companies of a 100MW station at a cost of about Dollars 250m. The need to find foreign private participants in power generation has also affected Cuba. Despite the suspension of work on a nuclear power plant in Jaragua on the south coast, the government is carrying out basic maintenance of the facility while advising that it would welcome a foreign government or company as a partner to finish and then operate the facility. The plant, with a rated capacity of 430MW, requires about 42 tonnes of enriched uranium as its initial load and a further 14 tonnes a year.</p>

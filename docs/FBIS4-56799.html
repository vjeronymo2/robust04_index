			<p>BFN     [Text] PANPRA [Nationalistic Progressive Revolutionary  Party of Haiti] leader Serge Gilles calls on the political  parties to meet immediately to analyze the latest situation.    [Begin Gilles recording in Creole] I would like to send this  call to all political leaders, especially the moderate ones; all  Haitian political leaders; all Haitian political parties that  belong to the center. This does not mean that I exclude the  others, but I think the moderates can understand me better. They  must meet, they must discuss, they must issue a statement in  which they clearly express their position to the international  community. I am also calling on the social sectors, all the  labor unions, to put their heads together to find a consensus,  to express their position, and to make the international  community know that if the new sanctions are applied, the  Haitian people will disappear.    Finally, my call goes out to General Cedras and President  Aristide to do their best, to make all possible and imaginary  concessions in order to solve the problem within the framework  of the parliamentary plan. I believe it is possible. [end  recording]</p>

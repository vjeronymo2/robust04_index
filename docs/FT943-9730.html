			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / London Stock Exchange: BA tumbles British Airways tumbled 12 to 417p in heavy trading of 9.2m as investors took profits following first-quarter figures below market expectations. Earnings of Pounds 88m fell short of the range of market forecasts of Pounds 90m to Pounds 95m. And although analysts were pleased with underlying profitability, they focused on the poor performance of the airline's associates such as TAT, the regional French carrier in which BA has a significant stake. Charterhouse Tilney downgraded its full-year profits prediction by Pounds 15m to Pounds 425m and said: 'Underlying profitability is well ahead of our expectations and growing strongly, but this is offset by the disappointing performance of the associates.' However, the fall came after a period of sustained strength. Since the market began to turn the corner at the end of June, BA shares have outperformed the FT-SE Actuaries All-Share Index by almost 7 per cent. Regional electricity stocks generally maintained the strong progress made last week, anticipating a better than expected outcome to the distribution review which should be known on Thursday. Dealers reported heavy switching out of Scottish Power, which closed at 389 1/2 p ex-dividend, and into Scottish Hydro-Electric, 16 1/2 stronger at 389 1/2 p. Dealers in the financial areas of the market braced themselves for the next set of interim figures from the big banks, those of Barclays, scheduled for this morning. Estimates of Barclays' interims range from Pounds 670m to Pounds 770m, with the dividend expected to be increased to 8p from last year's 6.5p. Barclays moved up 5 to 564p, closely followed by TSB, 4 1/2 firmer at 212 1/2 p. Merchant banks, meanwhile, came in for some aggressive buying, with Kleinwort Benson climbing 8 to 530p in the wake of sizeable switching out of SG Warburg, down 6 at 777p, following the recent strong profits from the former. The oil majors remained under pressure in spite of firmer crude oil prices yesterday, with dealers citing further switching out of the UK majors and into the US leaders. BP slipped a penny to 405 1/2 p in heavy volume of 13m shares, the largest individual turnover in the stock market yesterday. Shell Transport held at 739p on 2m traded ahead of interim figures due on Thursday. Some analysts said the market had become too complacent about the impact of the strike by workers in the Nigerian oilfields, which they felt could drive prices higher in the short term. Enterprise Oil dipped 3 to 425p, the shares affected by talk of a broker sell note. There were also vague suggestions that the company had received a bid for the 10 per cent stake in Lasmo that it acquired in its unsuccessful takeover bid earlier this year. The latter edged forward a penny to 156p. Smith &amp; Nephew was resilient at 159p in spite of announcing a spectacular loss on the sale of Ioptex, its US-based lens business, for Pounds 11m. It bought Ioptex in 1988 for Dollars 236m (Pounds 152.2m). Analysts said the loss was offset by the relief that S&amp;N had finally got out of the business. Amid continuing demand for the food retailers, there was a flurry of activity in William Low, the Scottish supermarket group which last week succumbed to a Pounds 248m bid from Tesco, with the shares advancing 3 to 363p. Tesco gained 1 1/2 at 244p and Argyll 5 at 281p. Profit-takers trimmed the recent gain in Associated British Foods, off 5 at 595p. Takeover talk died down in Hazlewood Foods, 2 1/2 easier at 142 1/2 p. Unigate, a rumoured predator, gained 4 at 384p. Speculative buying again supported United Biscuits, ahead 2 at 338p. Leading stores stocks were in demand as interest rate talk subsided. Great Universal Stores advanced 7 to 580p, WH Smith 15 to 484p, Kingfisher 5 to 515p and Marks and Spencer 7 to 431p. Sears was unruffled by a weekend press report suggesting weak sales at one of its subsidiaries. The shares were steady at 121p. The hot summer weather and hints of an easing of the wholesale price war were again inspiring demand for regional brewing groups. Among these, Regent Inns firmed 5 to 242p and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley 3 to 531p. Among the majors, Scottish &amp; Newcastle rose 5 to 524p and Bass 3 to 576p. However, Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed was warning analysts at its agm that the good weather was being offset by hesitant consumer spending, and that profits upgrades would be premature. The shares edged forward 2 to 282p. An agency cross and share buying by directors buoyed Grand Metropolitan, up 6 at 420p on turnover of 7.9m. Advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi was one of the star performers in London after the company posted first-half profits of Pounds 15.3m, against only Pounds 9.1m a year ago. The shares jumped 15 to 176p. WPP, which reports interim profits today, put on 3 at 111p and Aegis rose 2 1/2 to 30 1/2 p, both on consideration of the Saatchi profits numbers. The move by The Today newspaper to cut its price to 10p for a day hit Daily Mail &amp; General Trust 'A' shares, which fell 20 to 1003p, The Telegraph, down 10 at 357p, and United Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express, off 24 at 505p. Emap gained 7 at 430p after Trans World decided to recommend the group's bid.</p>

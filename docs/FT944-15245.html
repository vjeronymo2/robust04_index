			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Premier Health Because of an expected shortfall at its US offshoot, Nursing Management Services, second half operating profits of Premier Health Group were likely to be lower than the first half, the health services group warned. The winding down of a large contract in Atlanta had contributed to the shortfall. The company said the recent signing of new contracts should help to alleviate this though the full benefit of these contracts would only be felt in 1995.</p>

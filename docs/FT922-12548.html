			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Technology: The art of perfection - Steven Butler explains how a single speck of dust creates havoc with the way liquid crystal displays are made NEC, the Japanese electronics company, late last year surprised the electronics industry when it made the almost unbelievable claim that 50 per cent of the colour liquid displays coming off its production line were meeting quality control standards. Fifty per cent yields would be an embarrassment for almost any other industry, especially in Japan where companies pride themselves on rigorous quality control. But the thin film transistor (TFT) technology used for the colour screens - in which each of the million or so cells, or pixels, that make up a display panel is charged by an individual transistor - was just too complicated. Manufacturers were having to junk more than 80 per cent of everything produced because of blotches on the screens caused by dust. One transistor out of a million, short circuited by a single microscopic speck of dust, was enough to doom a panel. Progress in the past year by NEC and other companies, however, has raised the prospect that colour LCD screens used for computers and portable televisions may soon be cheap enough to be widely affordable. Shigehiko Satoh, engineering manager at NEC's liquid crystal display factory in Izumi, on Japan's Kyushu Island, will not name a precise yield figure today, but he says it is well over 50 per cent, and on the way to reaching 80 per cent in the near term. 'Each month the production yield is rising,' he says. NEC is shipping more than 10,000 10-inch panels a month and is hoping to cut the price from nearly Y600,000 today to Y60,000 in just three years. The race for the market has entered full swing. The main stumbling block is no longer how to design screens, but how to make an amazingly complex and delicate device at a price that will allow a mass market to take shape. The high cost of TFT panels begins with the glass, which must be sodium free, absolutely flat and uniform in thickness. Until recently only Corning, of the US, was able to supply glass of sufficiently high tolerance. NEC has begun to make some glass, and Hoya, another Japanese optical glass company, has products under development. Atop the glass goes seven layers of various chemicals which act as conductors and insulators, and which are etched with intricate circuitry to carry electronic messages to each of up to 1.3m pixels. The layers must be deposited with absolute uniformity, and an entire panel can be destroyed by a single, microscopic bit of dust. These layers, including colour filters and transistors, are sandwiched between sheets of glass 6 microns, or 6 millionths of a metre, apart - but the tolerance for spacing errors is only 0.02 microns across the entire 10-inch surface. The manufacturing difficulties and the procedures resemble those for semiconductors. The difference is that while a flaw on a silicon wafer may cause failure of one of several hundred chips processed at the same time, a single flaw on an LCD screen destroys an entire panel by shorting the circuits and producing blotches on the screen. Many of the precise technologies by which Satoh has lifted yields at NEC remain secret, and the secrecy that shrouds other manufacturers operations makes it impossible to say how much of a lead, if any, NEC has achieved. At Display Technologies, an IBM-Toshiba joint venture, yields have been raised from a miserable 8 per cent in the first month of production last September to about 40 per cent today. Yet it is plain that NEC's success owes less to any single trick than it does to persistent attention to the intricate details of a complex process. Each piece of glass, each worker, and each machine are bar coded and constantly monitored by computer. When a semi-finished panel emerges from the first, most sensitive processes involving chemical deposition and etching, it is tested. Precisely how this is done, even before driving circuitry is attached, NEC will not say. But it means that the computer can ferret out any abnormalities in the process, and statistically trace any offending machine, employee or material. It also saves NEC from proceeding needlessly with the difficult process of attaching driving circuits - the wire leads by which the panel can be attached to other electronic equipment - to a faulty screen. Engineers from equipment manufacturers have spent months at the plant trying to understand why one machine should achieve higher yields than another. Days are spent monitoring the movements of individuals, to try to understand why two different workers on the same machine should achieve such different results. Satoh now hopes his employees do not sit down, because this simple movement releases a cloud of invisible particles that can destroy thousands of dollars of products. NEC engineers at Izumi are now locked in debate. A building has been razed next to the Izumi factory, and Y30bn has been budgeted to build a new colour LCD plant that will produce 12- and 14-inch screens beginning next year. Yet Masamichi Shiraishi, president of NEC Kagoshima (the local subsidiary) has asked Satoh to achieve 100 per cent yields in the new plant, a target that Satoh believes is probably impossible. Even to come close to the target will demand complete rethinking of the production process and total automation. This would eliminate the biggest source of contamination - human intervention. Yet to reorganise from top to bottom a complex production process that has been demonstrably successful involves big risks. Most of the machines that Satoh and suppliers like Nikon and Anelva have worked so hard to fine tune will probably have to be scrapped. Rather than think of the process as a series of discrete operations performed sequentially, engineers would have have to devise an integrated process from scratch. The risks would plainly be great, but given the rapid growth in demand for LCD devices, so too would be the rewards. A previous article on liquid crystal displays appeared on Tuesday.</p>

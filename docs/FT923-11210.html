			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Bush heckled as Indochina adds to woes PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday morning rounded off a difficult political week by finding himself in a public shouting match with families of Americans taken prisoner or missing in action in Indochina. He was confronted by hecklers yelling 'release all files' and 'tell the truth,' and was forced to break off prepared remarks designed to follow up his order to the Pentagon to make public documents relating to the fate of the 2,266 Americans still unaccounted for in the Vietnam war. After five minutes, during which he exchanged heated remarks with an organisers of the meeting, Mr Bush returned to the microphone to defend his record. At one stage he was again interrupted and angrily shouted back: 'Will you please shut up and sit down.' It was 'simply, totally unfair' to suggest he had suppressed information on missing servicemen. Mr Bush also denied he had been party to the alleged scheme by the Reagan-Bush campaign in 1980 to delay release of the US hostages in Iran until after the election. 'What kind of allegation is that to make against a patriot?' he declared. The Iran connection also reared its potentially embarrassing head with the opening prosecution statement yesterday in the trial of Mr Clair George, the senior Central Intelligence Agency official charged with complicity in the Iran-Contra affair. Mr Craig Gillen, prosecuting attorney, said he would prove there was a 'massive cover-up' involving the CIA and other organs of government to conceal Lt Col Oliver North's operation, run from the White House, to resupply Nicaraguan rebels with proceeds of clandestine arms sales to Iran. Mr Caspar Weinberger, former defence secretary, has been indicted on separate Iran-Contra charges. Mr Gillen previously said he expected other prosecutions of members of the Reagan administration, in which Mr Bush, a former CIA chief, served as vice president. Desperate call, Page 9</p>

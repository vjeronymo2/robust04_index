			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont upbeat on recovery prospects IN ANOTHER upbeat assessment of the outlook for the economy Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told the Commons yesterday 'the prospects for sustained recovery are good'. He emphasised that inflation and the rate of increase in earnings were at their lowest level for 25 years, while manufacturing productivity was increasing sharply. Mr Lamont acknowledged the need for 'firm control' over public expenditure in responding to concern expressed by government backbenchers and opposition MPs about the size of the public sector borrowing requirement. Stressing the need to bring the PSBR down, he assured the House that it was 'a very high priority' for the government. Ms Clare Short (Lab Birmingham Ladywood) accused him of 'pushing up' the sterling exchange rate and warned it might result in the recovery being lost. Mr Lamont retorted: 'The pound is floating and we have no exchange-rate target'. Further cuts in interest rates were urged by Mr Austin Mitchell (Lab Great Grimsby), who said the government should stop trying to 'talk the pound up again'.</p>

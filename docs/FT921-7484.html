			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Cyclicals feature as Dow surges to set record high Wall Street AFTER losses earlier in the week, US stock markets rebounded strongly yesterday. The Dow blue chip indicator reached an all-time high in the wake of heavy demand for selected industrials, cyclicals and a range of stocks hard hit by recent declines, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 50.32 at a record 3,280.64, just past its previous historical peak of 3,276.83 recorded on February 12. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 forged ahead 5.64 to 413.90, while the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks, which had fallen 14 points in the previous two days, rallied 9.82 to 632.23. Turnover on the New York SE was a heavy 270.6m shares and rises led falls by 1,157 to 571. The buying was not triggered by any particular news, rather by a feeling among some investors that recent selling - some of it in reaction to President Bush's electoral troubles - had been overdone. Market analysts reported that computer buy programs had played an important part in leading the rally. Among individual stocks, those which had suffered from profit-taking in recent sessions put in some of the best performances. Merck rose Dollars 3 1/8 to Dollars 147 1/4 , International Paper Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 77 3/4 , McDonald's Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 42 1/8 and United Technologies Dollars 2 to Dollars 52. Airline issues were also in demand. UAL climbed Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 155 1/2 , AMR (parent group of American Airlines) Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 78 3/8 and Delta Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 72 1/8 . Other transport and freight stocks joined in the rally, with Federal Express jumping Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 53 3/8 and CSX ending Dollars 1 3/4 higher at Dollars 60 1/2 . Procter &amp; Gamble put on Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 100 5/8 after Kidder Peabody, the broking house, singled the stock out as its technical buy of the week. Selected bank stocks also benefited from sustained buying, JP Morgan gaining Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 60 5/8 , Bankers Trust Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 and Chemical Dollars 1 to Dollars 32 1/2 . On the over-the-counter market, the rally was inspired by a surge in demand for computer technology, healthcare and biotechnology stocks. Leading the way were Microsoft, up Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 117 1/2 , Apple, Dollars 2 5/8 ahead at Dollars 64 5/8 , and Medical Care International, Dollars 2 3/4 stronger at Dollars 70. Invacare advanced Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 25 3/8 after the home healthcare and medical equipment group reported fourth-quarter net income of 34 cents a share, up from 28 cents a share at the same stage a year ago. Canada Toronto stocks failed to be buoyed by the Wall Street strength and ended narrowly mixed after heavy trading. An analyst said there is a wait-and-see attitude in the market, with some investors looking towards today's Canada consumer price index for January. The composite index edged down 6.3 to close at 3,537.0, but rising issues held a small lead over declines of 306 to 291. Volume came to 33m shares. BC Sugar 'A' plunged CDollars 2 1/4 to CDollars 10 3/4 . The group reduced its quarterly dividend rate to 10 cents from 20 cents following disappointing first-quarter earnings. Petro-Canada lost CDollars  1/4 to CDollars 10 1/8 . The company reported a fourth-quarter loss of CDollars 364m, after a CDollars 369m restructuring provision, compared with earnings of CDollars 98m a year earlier.</p>

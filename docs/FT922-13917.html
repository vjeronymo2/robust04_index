			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: SIP moves ahead on improved sales SIP, Italy's state-owned telephone operating utility, raised net group profits by 21 per cent to L486.4bn (Dollars 397m), due partly to a 16.7 per cent increase in sales to L19,453bn. The improvement has prompted a L5 rise in the dividend to L75 a share for ordinary shares and L95 for savings stock. SIP's higher profits, which had been largely expected, came in spite of the slowdown in the Italian economy, with traffic volumes rising by only 8.8 per cent. The company has been investing heavily to improve the quality of services and install more efficient equipment to raise productivity. SIP said industrial costs had grown by 11.7 per cent in 1991, while operating profits surged by 17.4 per cent to L2,747bn. The group gave no indication of how much profits had been swollen by its monopoly over Italy's lucrative portable telephones service, which ranks second to the UK with 568,000 subscribers. Executives from SIP, which has an exclusive contract to operate telephone services until early next century, have been fighting government plans to open the market for portable phones to a second operator. Investments rose by 10.7 per cent to L10,751bn. The company has reached agreement with the government on a price cap system linking tariff increases to pre-set quality and productivity criteria. It said it had increased the number of digital exchanges while the time taken to install a phone had been cut by almost half to 17 days. Europa Metalli, the industrial arm of the SMI non-ferrous metals group, raised consolidated turnover to L3,013bn last year from L1,485bn in 1990 following the inclusion of sales for Kabelmetal, the German metals group bought in late 1990. Group net profits rose to L10.9bn after minority interests, against L8.9bn the previous year. As in 1990, the group is not proposing to pay a dividend.</p>

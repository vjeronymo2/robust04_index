			<p><P> January 14, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST CHARGES FILED AGAINST EL SEGUNDO COUNCILMAN  </P> <P> Ten conflict-of-interest charges have been filed against El Segundo Councilman  H. R. (Bob) Anderson by fellow Councilman Scot D. Dannen, who alleges that  Anderson improperly voted or discussed matters affecting Chevron U.S.A. and its  oil refinery while owning 6,600 shares of its stock.  </P> <P> The 10 charges were filed Thursday with the state Fair Political Practices  Commission. Dannen claims Anderson has "willingly and knowingly broken the law"  by participating in decisions that applied only to Chevron and in decisions  that affected various businesses in the city, including Chevron.  </P> <P> Dannen said the alleged conflict has opened to legal challenge the council's  decisions on matters dating back to May, 1988. They include city business  license fees, a building inspection program, a utility users tax and a  subdivision of Chevron land, according to documents filed with the FPPC.  </P> <P> Anderson said he has done nothing improper and labeled Dannen's action a  political attack. Anderson said he has yet to decide whether to seek reelection  when his term expires in April. Chevron, which founded El Segundo nearly 80  years ago as a refinery town, is a major landowner and taxpayer in the city.  </P> <P> Though Dannen said he wants to improve ethics in city politics, he also said he  would like to see Anderson off the council because Anderson is biased toward  business.  </P> <P> Anderson denied having such a bias, though he stated that local businesses are  overtaxed.  </P> <P> Councilman Alan West has sided with Anderson, but Councilman Jim Clutter said  Dannen has raised a valid issue concerning the possible legal jeopardy created  for the city by Anderson's alleged conflict. Mayor Carl Jacobson declined to  comment.  </P> <P> Dannen said he knows of no one considering a challenge to city actions based on  the possible conflict.  </P> <P> FPPC spokeswoman Sandra Michioku confirmed Dannen's filing on Thursday and said  it will be reviewed to determine whether a violation may have occurred. State  law requires a public official to refrain from "participating in or making  governmental decisions which could materially affect the financial interest of  the official," she said.  </P> <P> Anderson, who was a Chevron employee for 36 years until he retired as a  maintenance superintendent in 1983, said he acquired his Chevron common stock  through an employee stock purchase plan. The value of the stock is about  $445,000. He said his ownership is insignificant in comparison to the more than  342 million outstanding Chevron shares.  </P> <P> Dannen said the conflict filing was sparked at a Dec. 20 closed council session  in which Anderson discussed the extent of his Chevron holdings. Although  Anderson said his financial interest statement filed with the city lists  ownership of Chevron stock valued in excess of $100,000, Dannen -- as well as  Jacobson and Clutter -- said they did not know of the amount until the meeting.  </P> <P> In the open council meeting that followed the closed session, Anderson  abstained when the council adopted a building ordinance that eliminated a city  inspector program in which employees of large companies -- including Chevron --  were deputized to do certain city inspections on company property.  </P> <P> Anderson, however, participated in the 5-0 vote at that meeting to change  language in the terms of deed for land along Sepulveda Boulevard that Chevron  had donated to the city in 1988. The 25 acres included a golf course and  contained deed restrictions limiting its use. It was valued between $12 and $15  million at the time.  </P> <P> The action removed land-use rights retained by Chevron that the company felt  could interfere with its receiving a tax deduction for the gift. At the same  time, it gave the city more flexibility in developing the land.  </P> <P> Anderson said he abstained on the Building Code vote on the advice of City  Atty. Leland Dolley because elimination of deputy inspectors could cost Chevron  substantial amounts of money in inspection delays. But he said he voted on the  Sepulveda land lease changes because the city, not Chevron, benefited. He said  the land was a donation and the city now will be able "to develop the property  to the fullest extent."  </P> <P> Dannen, however, asserts that Chevron will receive a "considerable tax  advantage" from the vote. He charged Anderson with voting to help Chevron and  to protect his stock investment.  </P> <P> Dolley declined to comment on any of the advice he gave the council as city  attorney.  </P> <P> Although Anderson said he does not believe his votes have been improper, he  said: "If I'm at fault, I take the responsibility." He said that in the future,  he will vote "on nothing affecting Chevron."  </P></p>

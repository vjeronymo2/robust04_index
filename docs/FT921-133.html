			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / International Company News: NZ government forced to buy Fletcher shares THE New Zealand government is to pay Fletcher Challenge nearly NZDollars 400m (USDollars 219.8m) today to buy 104m of its shares currently worth around NZDollars 345m. Fletcher Challenge went ahead with a put option in spite of a last-minute appeal by Mr Jim Bolger, the prime minister, who said the government would be forced to borrow to fund it. The arrangement was part of a complex put and call option agreement in 1988, when FCL made a successful last-minute bid for the state-owned enterprise, Petrocorp, which seemed certain to be sold to British Gas. Earnings from Petrocorp have been the big source of profits for FCL since then, as the company's earnings have been hit by downturn in its international pulp and paper and construction sectors. Under the put and call option, the former Labour government agreed to buy back into the energy sector on March 31 last year by requiring FCL to sell it 100m shares at NZDollars 8.25 each. On the put side, FCL could require the government to to buy 104m shares at NZDollars 3.83. FCL shares were yesterday selling at NZDollars 3.30 - hence the big loss faced by the government - but at the time of the deal they were selling at Dollars NZDollars 4.25, and the prospect of the option being exercised seemed remote.</p>

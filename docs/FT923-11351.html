			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / Man in the News: Tabloid terror turned hero - Kelvin MacKenzie There has rarely been such a tabloid villain as Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, Britain's top-selling daily newspaper. His previous convictions are legendary. MacKenzie and his team have been guilty of: Lies - such as allegations about the private life of pop singer Elton John which led to a Pounds 1m out-of-court settlement, and the headline 'The truth' over a story about the behaviour of Liverpool fans before the Hillsborough football stadium disaster, which was no such thing; Jingoism - with headlines such as 'Gotcha' (one edition) after a British submarine sank the General Belgrano during the Falklands war, and 'Up yours Delors' in honour of the president of the European Commission; Prejudice - for announcing: 'Straight sex cannot give you Aids - official' and suggesting that Aids is nothing for normal folk to worry about; Bias - for election coverage that could have come straight from Conservative Central Office - culminating in the election morning front-page picture of Neil Kinnock inside a light bulb and the white-on-blue headline: 'If Kinnock wins today, will the last person to leave Britain please turnout the lights.' To his detractors, MacKenzie is the man who has debauched British press standards and is, more than any other, responsible for political threats to introduce statutory controls on press freedom or privacy legislation. He is keen to protect his own privacy. His Who's Who entry is almost certainly the shortest in the volume: 'MacKenzie, Kelvin Calder; Editor of The Sun, since 1981; b 22 Oct. 1946; m 1969, Jacqueline Mary Holland; two s one d. Educ: Alleyn's Sch., Dulwich. Address: The Sun, Virginia Street, E1 9BH. T: 071-782 4000.' Admirers, who include Rupert Murdoch, his proprietor, see him as one of Britain's most talented editors, whose loudmouthed tirades sum up what the average person is thinking or is about to think. Yet on Monday evening, MacKenzie the tabloid terrorist turned into cunningly effective defender of press freedom. As broadsheet editors refined their hand-wringing editorials on the revelations in The People newspaper about heritage secretary David Mellor's affair with an actress, Mr MacKenzie struck out in the only way he knows - by going on the attack. The Conservative-supporting editor of a Conservative-supporting newspaper pulled his own revelation out of a hat - that during the general election campaign a senior cabinet minister had tried to interest him in a sexual smear of Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown. The names and addresses of women who, it was claimed, had had affairs with Ashdown, had been supplied by the unnamed minister. The Sun says it checked the allegations and found them to be untrue. MacKenzie decided it was time to hit back at hypocritical politicians trying to blame newspapers for society's ills. He decided it was time, in his favourite phrase for causing mayhem, to put 'a ferret up the trouser leg'. Surprisingly, he chose to drop his bombshell on the Radio 4's rather sedate programme, The World Tonight. It is MacKenzie's favourite radio programme. He listens on the car radio as he travels home with the first edition of The Sun safely to bed. 'It's taught me all I know about Bosnia,' he says admiringly. That day, The World Tonight and everyone else were chasing MacKenzie for an interview on the Mellor affair. The television stations were being ignored, but MacKenzie's office was talking to a producer from The World Tonight. No, he would not come into the studio to debate the issue with Labour MP Clare Short. No, he would not come down six floors into a radio car. But he would do a telephone interview from his office. Presenter Richard Kershaw scrambled to a studio and went straight into an interview with a few scribbled notes. The notion of a privacy bill was simply a cloak to stop newspapers revealing the real intentions of the rich and famous, MacKenzie argued. 'If you don't want to appear in the papers, then don't drop your trousers. It is as simple as that,' was his blunt advice to politicians. And then he took a huge bite out of the hand that he had been kissing as recently as April by telling the story of the senior Tory minister. Kershaw recognised immediately he had an important story and one of far greater significance than that of the minister and the actress. MacKenzie came out of his office and told staff he might have dropped a clanger. They replied that what he had dropped was a story, and would he please get it into the paper. It missed the first edition, but a trenchant page-one opinion piece was soon produced. Even The Sun's bitter rival, the Daily Mirror, said that in spite of MacKenzie's fondness for fiction, 'even he, we would have thought, would not actually INVENT the story that a Cabinet minister telephoned him with the names of three (or five) women allegedly having an affair with Mr Ashdown'. MacKenzie insists that he had the conversation directly with the senior minister, whom he has refused to name, though government officials have denied the story. The incident marks an important turning point in relations between government and the press. Two weeks ago, Mr John Major, the prime minister, was indicating to journalists that privacy legislation was becoming more likely. Now, after MacKenzie's counter-attack and this week's declaration from the Press Complaints Commission that the public has the right to know about the private behaviour of politicians if it could affect their official duties, Mr Major is letting it be known that privacy legislation is unlikely. It is doubtful whether this will be enough to persuade MacKenzie to put the genie back in the bottle. 'The heat will be turned down on the tabloids and turned up on the politicians when parliament returns in the autumn,' promises MacKenzie.</p>

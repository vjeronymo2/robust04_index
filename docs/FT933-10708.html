			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Consumer fears hit new car sales NEW CAR sales in Japan in July slipped 10.8 per cent from those of a year earlier, while sales of imported vehicles were down 11.2 per cent, reflecting the lack of consumer confidence in an economy still apparently in decline. July is traditionally a good month for car dealers, as it comes just after workers have received bonuses and just before annual summer holidays, but the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association said sales had fallen by more than 10 per cent for four consecutive months. Except for March this year, when they rose 1.7 per cent, sales have been down year-on-year every month since July 1992. The period of double-digit drops is the longest since 1974, and also reflects the curbing of corporate capital spending. Lorry sales fell 9.3 per cent, while those of buses fell 11.6 per cent. Jada officials said the recent appreciation of the yen had further bruised consumer confidence, which has been weakened by a cut in new jobs. Meanwhile, the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, established by Japanese banks this year to buy their non-performing property loans, announced that it had purchased 14 loans with a face value of Y64.2bn (Pounds 406.3m) for a total of Y26.1bn during July. The CCPC is paying less for the collateral rights it purchases, suggesting that property prices are still falling and that banks are bringing in loans of lower quality. By selling the loan rights to the CCPC, banks are able to write off their exposure.</p>

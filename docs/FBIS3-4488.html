			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by She Jiaao (2457 0502 1159): "A Key to </F> Understanding Sino-British Dispute Over Hong Kong's Political  Structure"]    [Text] Recently, the British side published a white paper  entitled "On Representative Government in Hong Kong" without  consulting with the Chinese side. In doing this, the British  side unilaterally released some information about the talks  between the Chinese and British Governments on the arrangements  for the 1994/95 elections in Hong Kong. This constituted a  breach of the understanding reached between the two sides before  the opening of the talks, in which they committed themselves not  to reveal the substance of the talks. Furthermore, the British  side also misrepresented and lashed out at the Chinese side's  stance, in an attempt to lay blame on the Chinese side for  disrupting the talks.    In response to this, the Chinese side had no choice but to  release its version--"The Facts Concerning Several Major  Questions on the Sino-British Talks on the 1994/95 Electoral  Arrangements for Hong Kong," with the aim of dispelling  confusion among the public.    This dispute between China and Britain is not about arguing  whether Hong Kong needs democracy, as alleged by Hong Kong  Governor Chris Patten, but whether it is still necessary to keep  international commitments and whether the local constitutional  development still needs to converge with the Basic Law so as to  ensure a stable transition in Hong Kong. The substance of the  dispute is that the Chinese side wants to uphold national  dignity, to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong as  scheduled, to found the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region  [SAR] -- which will be placed directly under the central  people's government -- and to set up an SAR government primarily  constituted by Hong Kong people who love China and Hong Kong.  Britain, on the other hand, is not willing to give up its  colonial rule over Hong Kong but is attempting to extend its  influence on Hong Kong as a former colony after 1997, by  knocking together a pro-British clique under the pretext of  "constitutional reform." This is our key to understanding the  disputes between China and Britain on a series of issues.  <H5>  Ulterior Motives Behind Major Changes </H5>   Section 3 of Article 3 of the Sino-British Joint Declaration  provides that "the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will  remain basically unchanged;" Section 5 provides that "the  current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain  unchanged, and so will the life style." The Basic Law provides:  Hong Kong's political structure should evolve "in accordance  with the principle of gradual and orderly progress." However,  Chris Patten's "constitutional reform package" intends to  substantially change Hong Kong's existing political structure.  This obviously goes counter to the stipulations of the  Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.    Over the more than 100 years of British occupation, Hong  Kong's political structure has always been based on the  principles laid down in the "Letters Patent" and the "Royal  Instructions" and was seldom changed. Then why is it necessary  to introduce such major changes in the political structure of  Hong Kong during the late transitional period? All  clear-thinking people can see the ulterior motive behind this  illogic and faith-breaking act by Britain. Let us review the  following facts:    Hong Kong has always upheld an executive-led political  structure. The term "executive-led" means that ruling Hong Kong  is primarily the responsibility of the executive organ. The  Legislative Council [Legco] is merely a consultative  organization for the Hong Kong governor in the legislative  process which does not hold any real power of legislation. Any  law bill adopted by Legco must be ratified by the Hong Kong  governor before it comes into force, otherwise it cannot be  implemented. What is more, laws that have been ratified by the  Hong Kong governor can still be overruled by the British royal  family, which can even create legislation for Hong Kong directly.    In the past, Britain upheld the executive-led structure.  Britain's ultimate purpose in doing this was to ensure that the  British monarch and the Hong Kong governor appointed by him  could exclusively hold power and maintain Britain's absolute  rule over Hong Kong, so that Britain's interests in Hong Kong  could be safeguarded. Given this objective fact, the executive  organ -- free of interference from the legislative organ --  could have a free rein in handling affairs, which enabled the  government to make decisions and operate in a highly efficient  manner.    With his "constitutional reform package," Chris Patten has  been trying very hard to introduce the representative government  system practiced in western countries into Hong Kong, augment  the Legco's power, and change the existing executive-led  structure, so as to develop a structure under which "the  legislative branch dominates the executive branch." Hong Kong,  however, is not a state-like entity but merely an area. The  above development will inevitably lead to a loss of stability in  the decisionmaking process within the executive organ, thus  weakening the government's management efficiency. What is even  more serious is that, once the executive organ is dominated by  the legislative organ, Hong Kong will land in a position in  which it is vulnerable to endless disputes on political affairs,  the executive organ will be faced with difficulty in exercising  its power, and is likely to experience intervention by foreign  political forces in local affairs. Consequently, the  sovereignty that the Chinese Government is to exercise over Hong  Kong after 1997 will be nullified, and Britain will be able to  sustain its control over Hong Kong through this legislative body  which plays a dominant role.    The Basic Law has already expressly described the process  for introducing the democratic system into Hong Kong and  developing democracy in the territory, and it has set a rather  rapid pace for the process. For example, the future SAR  legislative organ will be completely constituted by elections  (including direct and indirect elections -- the number of seats  returned by direct election will be increased with every round  of elections until finally all the seats will be returned by  general election); the chief executive will be selected through  consultations or election; the legislative organ will be vested  with genuine legislative power, and so on. Therefore, this  dispute is not to argue whether democracy is wanted or not.  Whether the executive-led political structure is to be changed  or not is in substance a major issue of principle which has a  bearing on the smooth exercise of sovereignty and ruling power  over Hong Kong by the Chinese Government beyond 1997.  <H5>  Breaking Faith and Going Back on Their Word </H5>   As far as the issue of Hong Kong's political structure is  concerned, the British side has violated the Sino-British Joint  Declaration, the principle of convergence with the Basic Law,  and the agreements and understandings already reached between  the Chinese and British sides. Examples of the "three  violations" by the British side are numerous in the  "constitutional reform package" put forth by Chris Patten.    According to the decision of the National People's Congress  [NPC], the first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be  formed by 60 members, of whom 30 are to be returned by  functional constituencies. If the term of office of the last  Legco to be formed in 1995 is to stride past 1997 to become the  first Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR, then the last Legco  will have to be formed in accordance with the above principle.  However, Chris Patten's package proposes that 21 of the 30  seats returned by functional constituencies should be selected  through vote by individuals rather than through vote by  corporate bodies, and, for the nine newly installed seats, the  method of election by functional constituencies should be  replaced by a method in which "every individual member of every  functional sector will have a vote." In other words, the  package intends to make the indirect functional constituency  elections into a disguised form of direct elections based on  trades.    At present, of the 60 seats in the Hong Kong Legco, 21 (or  35  percent) are returned from 19 corporate bodies based on  different social functions. These seats are called seats  returned by "functional constituencies" (or "functional  sectors"). In the Basic Law, election by functional  constituencies is called "election by functional bodies." It is  obvious that elections by functional constituencies is an  indirect election based on the votes of functional bodies, which  is different from direct elections based on a vote by the entire  electorate.    Election by functional constituencies was first proposed by  the White Paper on representative government published by the  British Hong Kong Government in November 1984. In 1987, when  reviewing this system, the British Hong Kong Government  maintained that it had been approved by the majority of the  population, and therefore it decided to retain the system.  Since then, the number of Legco members returned by this form  of election has been increasing, going from six members in 1985  to 21 in 1991. During the drafting of the Basic Law, the  British side continued to recommend this form of election to the  Chinese side again and again. The number of seats returned by  direct election, even when it was referred to in the letter that  the British Foreign Secretary, Douglas Hurd wrote to Foreign  Minister Qian on 12 February 1990, did not include seats  returned by functional bodies. This is more proof indicating  that the British side always considered elections by functional  bodies as indirect elections.    In the belief that this form of election had been accepted  by  the Hong Kong people and did have some advantages, the Basic Law  drafting committee included in the Basic Law this form of  election by functional bodies, based on the principle that what  has been practiced and proved useful in Hong Kong shall be  retained, and this decision had the endorsement by the National  People's Congress.    Thus it can be seen that Chris Patten, in changing the  election by functional bodies as a form of indirect election  into a kind of disguised direct election, has totally violated  the Basic Law and the understandings and agreements reached  between the Chinese and British sides in the past, as well as  the original idea behind the introduction of seats for  functional constituencies. Even the former chief secretary of  the Hong Kong Government, David Akers- Jones, who was also the  author of this form of election, criticized Chris Patten's  constitutional package for contravening the original purpose of  elections by functional constituencies. This change will also  result in inequality in the right of election among citizens  because, of the more than 6 million population in Hong Kong, 2.7  million members of the working population will enjoy an extra  chance to vote in the disguised form of direct elections based  on profession, in addition to their first chance to vote already  granted on the basis of geographical divisions, while those  retired from these selected professions and other people outside  these professions enjoy only one chance to vote in the direct  election based on geographical divisions. This man-made  discrimination regarding the citizens' right to vote is  definitely unreasonable. It also violates the principle of  "gradual and orderly progress" for the development of the  elections by functional bodies. Although the British side later  submitted a revised program, it still will drastically expand  the electorate for the election by functional constituencies to  nearly 900,000, which means the 90,000-strong electorate, as  originally set for indirect election, will be drastically  increased by eight times. This obviously does not conform with  the principle of "gradual and orderly progress."    Then why did the British side recommend to the Chinese side  the form of election by functional constituencies in the past  but now intend to change it into a disguised form of direct  elections? The basic reason is that, as 1997 draws nearer and  nearer, the British side wants to arrange for more of its  followers to enter Legco. Indirect elections by functional  bodies can more easily return candidates who are prestigious and  influential within their functional sectors and who are willing  to assume responsibility for the Hong Kong community, and it is  more difficult for the British side to manipulate these people.  In direct elections, however, many professionals have neither  adequate financial resources nor the intention to run for  election. Thus, the British side will be able to manipulate the  elections behind the scenes and arrange for its favored  candidates to be elected to Legco.  <H3>  The True Color of the Colonialists Who Attempt in Vain To  Infringe Upon China's Sovereignty </H3>   When it comes to the issues of the "through train" program  and the electoral committee, the British side has more blatantly  exposed its true color as a colonialist attempting in vain to  infringe upon China's sovereignty over Hong Kong in regard of  the constitutional system issue.    The so-called "through train" refers to an arrangement by  which the members of the last Legco formed under the British  Hong Kong authorities; specifically, that Legco members elected  in 1995 will have their term of office carried forward beyond  1997 and thus they will become members of the first Legco of the  Hong Kong SAR of the PRC.    When drafting the Basic Law, the Chinese Government adopted  some opinions put forth by the British Government. The Basic  Law has included some provisions related to the "through train."  When the Basic Law was ratified by the Third Plenary Session of  the Seventh National People's Congress [NPC] on 4 April 1990,  the session also adopted the "Decision of the NPC on the Method  for the Formation of the First Government and the First  Legislative Council of the Hong Kong SAR." Paragraph 6 of this  decision reads: "If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legco  before the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR is in conformity  with the relevant provisions of this Decision and the Basic Law  of the Hong Kong SAR, those of its members who uphold the Basic  Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the PRC  and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the PRC, and who  meet the requirements set forth in the Basic Law of the Region  may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee, become  members of the first Legco for the Region."    In other words, whether the incumbent Legco members can  benefit from the "through train" program is conditional; it is  not unconditional. As long as the requirements as cited above  are met, the "through train" program will work.    However, Chris Patten is attempting to slap together a Legco  lineup according to his "constitutional reform package," which  he expects will take the "through train" and operate beyond 1997  as the future Hong Kong SAR Legco. It is obvious that this is  wishful thinking on his part, by which he is attempting to  ensure that this lineup will play a "legislative-led" role to  extend the influence of British colonial rule in Hong Kong.    Now let us review the disputes provoked by the British side  over the formation of the election committee.    According to the provisions set forth by Annex I and Annex  II  of the Basic Law, the chief executive and some members of the  Legco of the future Hong Kong SAR will be elected by a broadly  representative election committee. Annex I of the Basic Law  also expressly provides: "The Election Committee shall be  composed of 800 members from the following sectors: Industrial,  commercial, and financial sectors, 200; the professions, 200;  labor, social services, religious, and other sectors, 200;  members of the Legislative Council, representatives of  district-based organizations, Hong Kong deputies to the NPC, and  representatives of Hong Kong members of the National Committee  of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, 200.  The Election Committee's term of office shall be five years."    As far as this question is concerned, the Chinese and  British  sides reached an understanding through an exchange of letters in  the spring of 1990 before the NPC adopted the Basic Law. By  that time, the British side had already agreed in principle on  the composition and ratio of members of the election committee  as prescribed by Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft).    However, with his constitutional reform package, Chris  Patten  wants the 1995 election committee to "be composed completely or  mostly of members of district boards returned by direct  election." According to Chris Patten's package, both Hong Kong  deputies to the NPC and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National  Committee will not be able to become members of the election  committee as prescribed in Annex I of the Basic Law, nor can the  four categories of people join the election committee to make it  more balanced as prescribed in the Basic Law.    British Ambassador to China Alan Donald handed a written  note  to the Chinese side on 6 February 1990, putting forth five  principles on the formation of the election committee and a  proposal that the committee be formed by four categories of  people. The Chinese side gave a written reply to the British  side on 8 February that year, expressly stating that "the  Chinese side agrees with the five principles concerning the  election committee proposed by the British side in the document.  However, the Chinese side maintains that the provisions on the  composition and ratio of the election committee as specified in  Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law (Draft) must be followed  in terms of its proportional composition. This is because Annex  I was approved by a two-thirds majority of the membership of the  Drafting Committee at its eighth plenary session. China  believes that its provisions on composition and ratio are  appropriate and should therefore not be subject to change."  Then, in his letter to Foreign Minister Qian Qichen dated 12  February, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd confirmed: "I  agree in principle with the arrangements which you propose for  an Electoral Committee, which could be established in 1995. The  precise details of how this should be done can be discussed  between our two sides in due course." This evidence in black  and white shows that the British side did agree at that time to  have an election committee formed in 1995 in accordance with  Paragraph 2 of Annex I of the Basic Law. In other words, the  Chinese and British sides at that time had already reached an  agreement and understanding on the formation of an election  committee in 1995.    According to Chris Patten's package, all Legco members  elected in 1995 should be allowed to board the "through train"  to become members of the first Legco of the Hong Kong SAR of  China, whereas Hong Kong deputies to the NPC -- China's highest  organ of power -- and Hong Kong members of the CPPCC National  Committee -- China's highest consultative organ -- will not be  admitted into the Electoral Committee that is to elect some of  the Legco members. This is an extremely absurd plan which  constitutes an infringement upon China's sovereignty and the  Hong Kong people's rights.  <H3>  The Old Trick Is Played Again; Their Character Remains  Unchanged </H3>   Hong Kong has been a part of China since ancient times.  Following the Opium War of 1840, with solidly built warships and  powerful cannons, Britain forced the Qing government to sign  three unequal treaties and thus occupied Hong Kong, Kowloon, and  the New Territories. After the founding of new China, the  Chinese Government has been consistently upholding its stance of  not recognizing the three unequal treaties that the imperialists  forced upon China but has maintained that Hong Kong as a whole  should be recovered in due course through negotiations. In  1982, Chinese leaders officially informed the British side that  the Chinese Government had decided to recover the entire Hong  Kong area in 1997. After that, in the Sino-British talks on the  Hong Kong issue, the British side first argued that "the three  treaties are valid," then put forth the idea of "exchange of  sovereignty for ruling power," and later on the idea of "largest  extent of autonomy," with the aim of changing Hong Kong into an  independent or semi-independent political entity subject to  Britain's influence. After all these tricks failed, Britain  finally put forth the "constitutional reform package."    As the old saying goes: Reviewing the past helps one  understand the present. In modern world history, each time that  Britain was forced to withdraw from one of its colonies, it  consistently sowed discord and created conflicts and  confrontation by playing the trick of pseudo-democracy, thus  placing the new regime under the control of pro-British agents  so that it would be able to retain the political and economic  advantages that it enjoyed in its former colonies. The British  side has been trying to do this again with regard to the Hong  Kong issue. Back in 1946, as the British felt that their rule  over Hong Kong might not last long, then Hong Kong Governor Mark  Young made a statement on transforming Hong Kong's political  framework and planned to set up a "municipal council." In June  1949, the Chinese People's Liberation Army was heading south,  and the liberation of all of China was within sight. Under such  a circumstances, then Hong Kong Governor Alexander Grantham  gazetted the "municipal council" program. This was in fact the  very first "constitutional reform package" set forth by Britain  for Hong Kong. According to this package, Britain would withdraw  from Hong Kong only nominally but would actually maintain  British influence in Hong Kong through a British-style political  framework. New China did not send troops across the Shenzhen  River to expel the British out from Hong Kong, however. Britain  realized that it was possible for it to continue its rule over  Hong Kong without withdrawing from the territory. This being  the case, the introduction of a "constitutional reform" in  preparation for withdrawal from the territory would obstruct the  British Hong Kong authorities' rule over Hong Kong. Therefore,  without hesitation, Britain gave up Mark Young's plan for  establishing a "municipal council." The Churchill  administration even announced: "Introducing any more  far-reaching political reform in Hong Kong would not be  appropriate." We are now getting closer and closer to 1997,  when Hong Kong is to return to China, and the British will soon  terminate their colonial rule in Hong Kong forever. So we see  Britain playing its old trick again, sending Chris Patten to  Hong Kong to launch his "constitutional reform package"  characterized by the "three violations." If we compare what is  happening today with historical facts, Britain's covert  intentions will become obvious.    The Chinese Government today is different from the Qing  Government of the past, however, and the Chinese people of today  are no longer the "sick men of East Asia" that they used to be.  China's sovereignty brooks no infringement by anybody. As  pointed out by Deng Xiaoping: "The question of sovereignty is  not one which can be discussed." China will never barter away  principles. China hopes that the Sino-British talks can achieve  positive results and that China and Britain can cooperate with  one another since it will be beneficial to Hong Kong's stability  and prosperity. Nevertheless, this does not imply that it will  not be possible for Hong Kong to maintain stability and  prosperity without Britain. Even if the British side shows no  sincerity in reaching an agreement through negotiations and  persists in undermining Sino-British cooperation, China will  still be able to ensure a stable transition and long-term  prosperity in Hong Kong.</p>

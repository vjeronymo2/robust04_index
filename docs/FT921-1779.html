			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Catholic church rounds on Moi KENYA'S Catholic bishops yesterday delivered an unprecedented attack on the government of President Daniel arap Moi, blaming it for the recent spate of violence in which more than 60 people have died. The criticism, in a pastoral letter read to congregations throughout Kenya, reflects growing political unease, accompanied by doubts about Mr Moi's commitment to a multi-party system. Last November western donors made new aid to Kenya conditional on economic and political reforms. Last Friday the government responded to the fighting by banning political meetings. Opposition leaders claim that the government instigated the clashes, seeking a pretext for a clampdown on dissent and postponement of multi-party elections. In their letter, the bishops dismiss claims that fighting in western Kenya, mainly between Mr Moi's minority Kalenjin tribe and Luo and Luhya ethnic groups, has been caused by land disputes or tribal rivalries. Nor do they accept the government's suggestions that the conflict is a result of last December's decision to lift the ban on multi-party politics. Instead the bishops suggest that the conflict 'is all part of a wider political strategy' involving 'well-trained arsonists and bandits' who have been 'transported to the scenes of crime from outside the area'. The letter adds: 'There has been no impartiality on the part of the security forces. On the contrary, their attitude seems to imply that orders from above were given in order to inflict injuries only on particular ethnic groups. 'It is difficult for the government to exonerate itself from the responsibility of these violent clashes.' The letter also criticises 'high-ranking politicians, declaring certain zones to be exclusively for the (ruling) Kanu party'. The result is that people have been 'forced out of their schools, jobs, houses, and even from their land'. The bishops express concern about the 'lack of impartiality' in radio and television coverage, and condemn civil servants who refuse to license opposition meetings. There was no immediate government response to the letter, but President Moi, addressing a meeting yesterday in Chebilat, north-western Kenya, said that the government was concerned by the violence.</p>

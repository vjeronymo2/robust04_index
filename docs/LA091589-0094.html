			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TEACHERS VOTE TO STRIKE ON OCT. 16  </P> <P> Beverly Hills teachers overwhelmingly approved a strike vote Thursday, setting  the stage for a walkout if they fail to renegotiate increases in salary and  benefits for the final year of their three-year contract, teachers' union  officials said.  </P> <P> Teachers represented by the Beverly Hills Education Assn. voted 198 to 6 to  strike if no agreement is reached by Oct. 16. A state mediator has been called  in to conduct the 4-month-old contract negotiations, which resume Thursday.  </P> <P> The district is offering to increase teacher salaries 3.05% and to extend the  existing bargaining agreement another year with a 5% wage increase for the  1990-91 school year. Teachers, however, demand an immediate 11% raise or a 20%  increase over two years.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills teachers start at a $21,604 annual salary and earn a maximum of  $46,270, union officials said, pointing out that Los Angeles teachers signed a  new contract this year with salaries ranging from $27,346 to $50,123.  </P> <P> "Compared for what other districts are settling for, we have just lost so much  ground," said union President Judy McIntire.  </P></p>

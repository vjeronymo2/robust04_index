			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 19 March Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Next week at a regular meeting in Hawaii on  semiconductors, if the United States formally asks Japan to  present a new action plan aimed at ensuring a 20-percent share  for foreign-made semiconductors on the Japanese market, the  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI] will reject  it, saying "the industries of both countries are making efforts  for cooperation under the current agreement, and there is no  need for a new plan" (according to Vice MITI Minister Hideaki  Kumano). The ministry is wary lest the United States should  choose--in applying the model of resolving the recent cellular  phone issue--to demand that the Japanese Government guarantee  the enforcement of private sector agreements in the auto and  auto parts sector, as well as the semiconductor sector, which  would amount to a de facto setting of "numerical targets."    MITI appreciates the fact that foreign semiconductor  products' share of the Japanese market exceeded 20 percent in  the October-December quarter of 1993 according to the  calculations of both Japan and the United States, and its  Machinery and Information Industries Bureau declared, "This is  proof that the cooperative relations between the Japanese and  U.S. industries are working well."    The United States, however, is unhappy that the overall  market share for 1993 fell short of 20 percent and is said to be  contemplating asking Japan to present a new action plan. MITI  reacts to this by saying: "We have stuck to the position of  rejecting numerical targets throughout the economic framework  talks. We will not agree to the idea of setting share targets in  the semiconductor market and then having these guaranteed by the  government." The ministry will point out that the number of  projects involving U.S. manufacturers and Japanese users  cooperating from the developmental design-in stage exceeded  3,000 in 1993, having grown six-fold over the past seven-year  period. It wants to solicit the understanding of the United  States by emphasizing that the industry-level cooperation is  proceeding smoothly.</p>

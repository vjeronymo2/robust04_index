Replying to a question, Kasoulidhis said this is  evident from statements by [Turkish Cypriot leader] Rauf Denktas  that the talks could not take place with such speed.  Kasoulidhis repeated that our side believes the talks should  take place at a slow pace but that the timeframe of until the  end of March is more than long enough for the UN Security  Council, with the UN secretary general's report, to reach  conclusions about where the proximity talks are headed.</p>

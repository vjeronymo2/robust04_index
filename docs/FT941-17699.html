			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / In a class of their own: The UK government's plans for selective education Are grammar schools on their way back? Selective education received its strongest backing for a quarter of a century this week when the UK government announced it would provide funds for schools which may be wholly or partially selective. In the clearest extension of the government's policy of fostering choice and diversity in education, the Funding Agency for Schools, a government quango, will also be given the power to create schools in areas where there is a shortage of places. The proposals elicited condemnation from the Labour party and from teachers' unions. Mrs Ann Taylor, the shadow education secretary, described selective education as favouring 'the very few at the expense of the vast majority', while Mr Don Foster, her Liberal Democrat counterpart, said: 'The measure will increase chaos and division.' Mr Doug McAvoy, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, said: 'The plans will create an elite education for a limited number of pupils. This is not the way to have high-quality education for all of our children.' The proposals probably mean the end of the 'neighbourhood comprehensive' which now dominates secondary education. But the UK is unlikely to see a return to the system of grammar schools, secondary moderns, and technical schools, with admissions decided by exams taken at the age of 11, mapped out in the 1944 Education Act. Instead, the 'big idea' of Mr John Patten, the education secretary, is to allow a school system to emerge in response to local demands. But will the reforms create coherent and diverse schooling or a patchwork of provision? Already, schools and local authorities which dislike the comprehensive system can reject it. More than 1,000 schools have opted out of local authority control in favour of accepting direct grants from the government. This is far fewer than the government hoped - it aimed for 1,500 by April this year - but enough to set a trend. If a comprehensive school opts out, Mr Patten can allow it to become selective. Or it can choose to become a specialist 'technology college' and receive extra funding. Schools may now select up to 10 per cent of their intake on the basis of particular skills - including technology, sport, music and drama. Wandsworth, the Conservative-controlled London borough, shows the scope schools have to shift from the comprehensive model. By last September, all but four of its secondary schools had opted out. Of the remainder, Battersea school is now a technology college; Ernest Bevin, a purpose-built boys' comprehensive, wants to admit half its pupils on the basis of academic selection; and Chestnut Grove comprehensive will admit 30 out of its annual intake of 150 on the basis of aptitude for art and design, and another 30 on linguistic ability. Two grant-maintained schools, Burntwood, which is girls-only, and Waveney, which is mixed, are consulting the government about admitting roughly half their intake by selection. If Wandsworth's proposals are passed, only one local authority comprehensive will be left in the borough. Admissions will be in the hands of the schools, not the council. The pattern in the rest of the country is less clear, although in Penrith, Cumbria, Mr Patten has shown he wants to encourage selective schools where there is minimal local support. Last year, he allowed one opted-out school to become a grammar school although the plan was opposed by the head of the town's remaining comprehensive, and despite keen opposition from some teachers, councillors and parents. The result is that both schools are competing fiercely for the most able pupils, and their development strategies are in disarray. Such confusion raises the deeper question of whether selectivity is the right direction for UK education. Direct comparisons between the results achieved by selective schools and comprehensives offer few clues as the intake of selective schools gives them an in-built advantage. However, studies into the 'value added' by schools - the degree to which pupils improve during their time at a school - suggest selectivity makes little difference. For example, the Audit Commission's study on 'value added' in A-level results found 'no single type of institution appears consistently more effective at A-level than others'. Surviving grammar schools perform well, but analysis of High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, home to three of the nation's top grammar schools, indicates their success is grounded in local authority control, rather than competition. The head teachers of the grammars and the six secondaries in High Wycombe discuss and co-ordinate admissions procedure, while pupils at one school can take courses at another after the age of 16. Buckinghamshire county council retains total control of all admissions. Even the Royal Grammar, which has opted out, allows the county to select its pupils. The process differs deeply from the brave new design emerging in Wandsworth. It is mistaken, therefore to see the latest reforms as a nationwide return to the postwar system. The changes are not taking education back, but forward into uncharted territory. Big obstacles remain. Opposition to the government may derail the proposals. Head teachers may not support them, and local communities may not want to set up selective schools. The pupils whose needs are not now being met may find no improvement in the new system. The power to make the changes rests with Mr Patten. His decisions will have far-reaching consequences for children across the UK.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Russia tries to export unemployed RUSSIA is asking other countries to allow in Russian 'guest workers' to relieve the pressure of unemployment and earn hard currency. A Russian minister said the 'traditional labour-accepting countries' of Australia, Canada and the US had been approached to take quotas of Russian workers. The German embassy said that two programmes, one allowing a maximum of 11,000 Russian workers to come in under contracts with Russian companies working in Germany and the other allowing 2,000 to work for 18 months to acquire skills, were expected to be signed next month. There was no intention, however, of signing further agreements. The frank admission by Mr Igor Khalevinsky, a deputy Labour Minister, that Russia is seeking to export labour to richer states after decades of refusing exit visas shows growing concern at unemployment.</p>

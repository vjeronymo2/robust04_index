			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMUNITY COALITION JUMPS INTO DETROIT SCHOOL BREACH  </P> <P> These days, the once-grand avenues of inner-city Detroit are pockmarked with  boarded-up buildings and grass-sprouting sidewalks. But new signs of hope are  also appearing. One example: the Detroit Compact, a coalition of business,  labor, government, higher education, the community, and the schools, modeled  after the pioneering Boston Compact.  </P> <P> Its task: to guarantee a job or further educational opportunity to every  Detroit high school graduate who meets the standards, and to provide summer  jobs along the way. Begun in 1988, the compact has raised $600,000 from private  and state sources. It has recently signed up one high school and four middle  schools and plans to operate within the entire school system within 10 years.  </P> <P> What's the deal? Students expecting a job must sign on to meet a set of  criteria. Among them: reading and math skills at the 11th-grade level; at least  a C average in a set of predetermined courses; 95% attendance in the 12th  grade, with 97% punctuality; no felony convictions or major Student Code of  Conduct violations; no drug use; and a set of leadership and teamwork skills,  evidenced by letters of reference. College-bound students must have all of the  above plus a 3.0 grade-point average and a specified score on the American  College Test (ACT), a national college-entrance exam.  </P> <P> With 6,000 to 7,000 high school students graduating each year, the commitment  by area businesses is potentially significant -- as is the commitment by the  state's universities, which are lining up with offers of free tuition for those  who keep the pact.  </P> <P> Why these generous inducements?  </P> <P> Businesses need a skilled and responsible work force. And universities are  competing to meet their own minimum targets for minority enrollment. The  Detroit schools are by far the largest source of black university students in  the state. Yet if the University of Michigan alone were to meet its 10%  minority goal, says Detroit school Supt. John W. Porter, there would be no  black college-bound students left to enroll in any other state university.  RUSHWORTH M. KIDDER  </P></p>

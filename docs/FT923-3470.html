			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Two December bets on German rate cut THE Bundesbank could cut interest rates in December, writes Our Markets Staff. Mr James Cornish, a strategist with County NatWest, said yesterday that Bundesbank professional staff see room for a percentage point cut in discount rate then, probably with a smaller fall in Lombard rate as well. Meanwhile, Mr Eberhard Martini, president of the German Banking Association and chairman of Bayernhypo, said in a magazine interview that German interest rates could come down 'at the beginning of next year at the latest, possibly though in December.' FRANKFURT rallied from midsession lows, the DAX index closing 3.41 higher at 1,528.67 after a 5.06 fall to 597.37 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover was little changed at DM4.2bn. Dealers gave futures markets the credit for the rebound. Heavyweights featured with Allianz closing DM5 higher at DM1,730 after a DM25 fall to its low for the day. Chemicals were mostly flat, but a large selling order from London and tomorrow's start of the subscription period for a one-for-seven rights issue saw Degussa drop DM10.30 to DM303 before finishing DM5 lower at DM308.30. MILAN's privatisation candidates, Credito Italiano and Nuovo Pignone, were suspended yesterday and interest moved to companies for which similar hopes had been disappointed. The food group, Sme dropped L149, or 4.1 per cent to L3,501 and Banca Commerciale by L47 to L2,528. An early rally on government capital gains moves and privatisation news faded as thoughts returned to Italy's present financial situation, and a rise of 1.63 to 376.26 in the Comit index at the official close was replaced by a fall of nearly 1 per cent in London post-bourse trading. PARIS advanced in a technical reaction to recent declines, the CAC-40 index rising 17.41 to 1,774.18 in turnover of FFr1.8bn. Rhone-Poulenc, suspended limit down in the morning after cutting its projected 1992 operating profit, saw its certificates close down FFr70 or 11.6 per cent at FFr530 with some 354,000 shares traded. St Gobain was another casualty, losing FFr13 to FFr516 on expectations of disappointing first half figures. Air Liquide gained from switching out of Rhone-Poulenc, putting on FFr19 to FFr745. Among Nordic markets, SWEDEN's Affarsvarlden index lost 5.3 to 707.2 and OSLO's composite index advanced 6.09 to 309.33. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel noted on Sweden that, while the collapse in the financial sector kept sentiment nervous, foreign buyers were seen coming into the market in late trading, focusing on international blue chips. Astra, whose A shares gained SKr2 to SKr512 while the B's were unchanged at SKr503, accounted for 25 per cent of turnover. Mr Peter Bradshaw, Scandinavian analyst at Robert Fleming, commented that Oslo remained resilient because of benefits derived from the oil sector and lower interest rates. Norsk Hydro climbed NKr5.50 to NKr130.00. ZURICH rose as money market rates edged lower, the SMI index adding 13.7 to 1,792.8. However, Kuoni fell SFr200 to SFr29,700. The travel agency, which said yesterday that it has been shoring up its takeover defences after its largest shareholder selling out in May, has risen from a low of SFr13,400 early in the year. BRUSSELS moved up in light trading, with banks and financial groups stronger on news that the Dutch insurer, ING, may bid for BBL. The Bel-20 index advanced 7.16 to 1,073.21. BBL, which closed at BFr3,275 on Wednesday, was suspended from trading yesterday amid uncertainty over the possible ING bid. Elsewhere, Tessenderlo rose BFr40 to BFr6,050 after announcing an increase in interim earnings in spite of a worldwide downturn in the chemical industry. In the same sector, UCB rose BFr400 to BFr22,350 after announcing a rise in first half profit after the close on Wednesday. AMSTERDAM saw strong interest in ING, down Fl 1.80 to Fl 42.20 on the BBL story. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.2 weaker at 108.3. Royal Dutch firmed 60 cents to Fl 142.30 after announcing a higher interim dividend. MADRID's general index lost 2.37 to 207.65.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - SEP 10  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                              Hourly changes  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close 1022.09  1020.79  1021.29  1024.10  1025.62  1025.52  1026.81  1027.59  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               Day's High  1028.33    Day's Low  1019.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------         Sep 9       Sep 8       Sep 7       Sep 4       Sep 3        1021.42     1029.38     1032.28     1029.27     1031.46  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

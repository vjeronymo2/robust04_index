			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Investors snap-up double-digit Eurolira coupons RETAIL INVESTORS with a penchant for high-yielding bonds have been piling into the Eurolira sector of the international bond market recently, eager to snap-up bonds with double-digit coupons. The Eurolira sector has experienced quite a change in sentiment in recent months. When the lira was pulled out of the European exchange rate mechanism last September, it was devalued by at about 20 per cent against the D-Mark. Added to this, the almost daily revelations of corruption among politicians led to considerable political uncertainty and did little to help Italy's financial markets. However, the second Danish vote on the Maastricht treaty helped to put the convergence argument back on track. As the Bundesbank bowed to pressure last week and lowered its key interest rates, it prompted a wave of interest rate cuts across much of Europe as well as raising hopes that other countries - including Italy - would follow suit. Investor interest in the Eurolira sector has been prompted by two main factors - the high yield, and the current relative stability of the lira. 'Investors buy this market because this is the highest coupon currency in Europe,' says Mr Niccolo Nuti, head of capital markets at Credito Italiano in Milan. 'This is one of the few remaining bond markets where you can get double-digit coupons,' said one dealer at an Italian bank last week, adding that the prospect of falling yields was helping to stimulate buying interest among investors. Deutsche Bank in London last week lead-managed a successful L200bn, 10-year deal for Abbey National Treasury Services with a coupon of 10 per cent. Mr Roger Bates, of Deutsche Bank, said one reason for the deal's success was the fact that as interest rates in Europe were set to fall, this represented one of the few remaining opportunities to buy bonds with a double-digit coupon. Coupons in the Eurolira sector have been falling since the start of the year, when investors were able to buy bonds with coupons of 12.75 per cent. In the wake of the Abbey National deal, the EBRD launched a L200bn, seven-year deal with a 9.75 per cent coupon. Admittedly, the lira is not the only high-yielding currency in Europe, but dealers say the Eurolira sector is regarded as a more liquid market than other high-yielding currencies, such as the peseta. The biggest issue in Eurolira is the EIB's L1,000bn benchmark. Meanwhile, the currency - which came out of the ERM in September and weakened to around 1,000 to the D-Mark - has been strengthening steadily again. 'The lira has finally found its equilibrium - it will probably stay where it is or appreciate slightly against the D-Mark,' says one Eurolira specialist. Traditionally, the Eurolira market has appealed to retail investors from the Benelux countries and Switzerland who want bearer bonds rather than registered government securities. They would rather buy top-notch paper denominated in lira for the high coupon and a play on the currency, than take Italian government risk. For the borrowers themselves, the reason for tapping the Eurolira sector is predominantly swap-related. A total of L8,912bn (about Dollars 5.89bn) of new issues has been launched in the Eurolira sector in the first six months of 1993, according to figures compiled by Euromoney. A few borrowers keep the proceeds in lira to fund Italian subsidiaries: for example, Abbey National borrowed in fixed-rate lira and swapped the proceeds into floating-rate lira for financing its Italian mortgage subsidiary. But dealers estimate some 90 per cent of issues are swapped into dollarsor D-Marks, depending on the swap opportunities, in order to obtain funding at well below London interbank offered rate.</p>

Silajdzic hoped that this would be the beginning  of a new phase, "but no one knows whether or not the Serbs are  going to implement it."    As is known, General Michael Rose, commander of the UN  forces  in Bosnia, said that he expects the agreement to be implemented  fully as of midday today, Thursday.    We asked Haris Silajdzic: Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev said yesterday (Wednesday) that Russia is against  launching air strikes on Bosnian Serb positions. However, it  supports making Sarajevo a UN protectorate. He said that Russia  could send forces to implement the plan.    Haris Silajdzic said: We have not asked for Russian forces  to be sent to Sarajevo.    [Al-Husayni] They are willing to come.    [Silajdzic] We have not requested any.    [Al-Husayni] Have you requested French, British, Ukrainian  forces?    [Silajdzic] And forces from Islamic states.    [Al-Husayni] So you reject the dispatch of Russian forces to  you.    [Silajdzic] I said we have not requested any.    [Al-Husayni] The Bosnian parliament proposed Bosnia's  partition into four cantons....    [Silajdzic] It was the Croatian, not Bosnian, parliament  which proposed Bosnia's partition into 18 cantons. The problem  is that people do not follow the news of what is happening.    [Al-Husayni] Your representative to the United Nations  agreed to Sarajevo's being turned into a demilitarized zone. Do  you too agree to that?    [Silajdzic] We have not agreed to the demilitarization of  Sarajevo, nor have we spoken about this matter.    [Al-Husayni] Your representative told British television  that your agree.    [Silajdzic] A representative is a representative and a  government is a government, of course.    [Al-Husayni] As a government, do you refuse to turn Sarajevo  into a demilitarized zone?    [Silajdzic] No one has asked for demilitarization or  nondemilitarization. UN Security Council Resolution 836  stipulates the Serbian forces' withdrawal and we are in the  process of implementing this resolution.    [Al-Husayni] You are now in Geneva for the sake of  implementing this resolution.    [Silajdzic] We are here for the sake of negotiations.    [Al-Husayni] What about the resolution's implementation?    [Silajdzic] It should be implemented on the ground.    [Al-Husayni] In brief, what peace plan is the Bosnian  Government taking to Geneva?    [Silajdzic] It is an expanded plan. We are carrying plans,  programs, and pages. I am carrying with me 10 kg of pages and  papers full of proposals.    [Al-Husayni] What is your opinion of NATO's decision to  issue an ultimatum to the Serbs before launching air strikes?  Do you believe it is serious?    [Silajdzic] It is a serious organization, and I expect it to  issue nothing but serious things. It is a very big  organization, a world organization, the strongest military  organization in the world, and its statements are bound to be  serious. We take all its decisions seriously.    [Al-Husayni] Do you expect an air strike to be launched?    [Silajdzic] We expect nothing. We are awaiting the results  of the NATO session, then we will see what is going to happen.</p>

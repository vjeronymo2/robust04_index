[Basindwah] Good morning to you.    [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih  briefly visited Cairo on Wednesday and met President Muhammad  Husni Mubarak. You attended the meeting. What were the main  topics of discussion in light of the Yemeni crisis and the  Egyptian role?    [Basindwah] First, I would like to note that the ease with  which the visit was quickly organized reflects the warmth of  relations between Sanaa and Cairo. There are no formalities  between the two countries. The hospitality was warm and as  expected. Sanaa senses Cairo's interest in Yemeni developments.  This is why President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih visited his brother  His Excellency President Muhammad Husni Mubarak to inform him of  the latest developments in the Yemeni crisis. He said that  Sanaa fully accepts Cairo's mediation and role by President  Mubarak to bring viewpoints closer. Sanaa always looks forward  to Cairo playing its major pan-Arab role. Cairo has always been  the source of hope for the Arab nation.    [Abu-al-Majd] Were there new proposals to resolve the  crisis,  especially as the visit of President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih came  amid high tension between him and Vice President 'Ali Salim  al-Bid, who visited Cairo before signing the Pledge and Accord  Document?    [Basindwah] I believe that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's  visit to Cairo did not come amid a deterioration of the crisis,  certainly not on the military level. I believe the military  crisis has virtually been defused. But there are continuing  political differences and the ice between Aden and Sanaa must be  melted. Cairo can play a major role here. Undoubtedly, there is  agreement on particular things that Cairo will do. Sanaa and  President Salih welcome this. President Salih hopes the credit  for ending the crisis will go to Cairo.    [Abu-al-Majd] What are the most important things Egypt will  do to end this crisis? We have always hoped that we would see  Yemeni unity take its natural and realistic course as a model  for comprehensive Arab unity.    [Basindwah] I cannot reveal much; we must take the advice of  our noble prophet, may God's peace be upon him, especially in  this blessed month of Ramadan, to be secretive when we go about  our businesses. I can tell you that Cairo has a vision, a  method to resolve the crisis. I believe this vision is  reasonable and Cairo must work with the parties to the conflict  to implement its proposals. Everybody must realize that the  Yemenis' relations with each other are not relations between two  peoples or two countries. We in Yemen are one Arab Muslim  people, one Arab Muslim country.    [Abu-al-Majd] What are Egypt's ideas on this concept?    [Basindwah] Cairo believes the Pledge and Accord Document is  the basis for heading toward ending the crisis. As long as  everyone clings to the Document, we need only discuss the  mechanisms of how to implement it. Undoubtedly, the  implementation will take place within the framework of the  Constitution.    [Abu-al-Majd] But, Minister, the vice president and  president  were supposed to return to Sanaa after signing the document in  the Jordanian capital, Amman. This did not happen and military  clashes took place. Why did the crisis escalate and what do you  believe is the solution?    [Basindwah] Of course, the president, vice president, and  the  entire government were supposed to return to Sanaa after the  Document was signed in Amman on 20 February. But we all know  what happened. The signing was accompanied by military  escalation. Let us be optimistic and hope that 'Id al-Fitr will  introduce goodwill for Yemen and the Arab and Islamic nations as  well as for the whole world.    [Abu-al-Majd] But the Socialist Party, Minister, has some  demands, such as arresting those who assassinated some of its  leaders and other things. Is the People's Congress ready to  meet these demands?    [Basindwah] I cannot speak for the People's Congress because  I am not a member. I belong to no party. I am independent, I  repeat, independent, and I say this very frankly. But I also  say that we, as government officials, need to cooperate to  arrest all those who are proven to have been involved in the  assassination operations. This is a group responsibility that we  must all shoulder. None of us should attempt to weasel out of  it. Anyone who tries to shy away from this responsibility must  be punished and held accountable for doing so.    [Abu-al-Majd] Minister, are there any mediators other than  Cairo involved in trying to resolve the crisis?    [Basindwah] There is a lot of mediation and from various  sides but the more acceptable mediation comes from the brothers.    [Abu-al-Majd] Is there any mediation from outside the Arab  world?    [Basindwah] Of course, some friends who are not Arabs are  using their good offices continuously to reduce the tension.  But there is no mediation in the sense of sitting round a table  to discuss how to get out of the crisis.    [Abu-al-Majd] Can you give us some examples of these  mediating countries from outside the Arab world?    [Basindwah] Of course, heading these countries is the  friendly United States.    [Abu-al-Majd] Is this mediation acceptable to both sides?    [Basindwah] Both sides accept this mediation. There are also  the good offices of the European Union. And there are the  constructive and objective efforts or positions of Japan,  Russia, China, and many friendly countries.    [Basindwah] But what, for the Yemeni people, is the closest  mediation that could realize a final solution to the crisis?    [Basindwah] The mediation of the brothers, primarily Egypt.</p>

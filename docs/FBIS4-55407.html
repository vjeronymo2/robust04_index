			<p>BFN     [Text] Jagodina, 15 May (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, the  Bosnian Serb parliament speaker, told Radio Jagodina today that  the joint communique by foreign ministers of the United States,  Britain, France, and the European three is a significant step  forward in the resolving of the Bosnia-Herzegovina crisis. The  fact that everyone is for the end of hostilities and the return  to negotiations is encouraging. As regards this we are not  setting any conditions, for we believe that there is no  alternative to peace, Krajisnik said. Expressing his optimism,  Krajisnik said "peace will come soon."    Admittedly, we also have some have objections, primarily to  the four-month cease-fire, for we think that a seasonal truce  does not lead to an overall solution of the problem, Krajisnik  said and added: But if this is a compromise needed to stop the  Muslim hawks, who want to continue the war at any price, then we  will agree to it. The main stumbling block in the future will  be the unequal treatment of the republic of Srpska in the  negotiations, Krajisnik said, and specified that he was  referring to the lifting of the sanctions.    The contact group for Bosnia has not done what it should  have  done -- that is it has not made clear to all parties involved  our position -- that we do not want to negotiate until the  sanctions are lifted, Krajisnik said, stressing that the Serbs  will firmly insist on this. The Geneva agreement definitely  acknowledged two countries in the former Bosnia-Herzegovina,  which is better than having three, but we are confused by the  territorial division of 51 [for Bosniaks, Croats] and 49 percent  [for the Serbs], Krajisnik said. According to him these  percentages were used when the option of three countries in the  area was being discussed.    Any division is possible, but this kind of simplified one,  which does not take into consideration the relation between the  quantity and quality of the territory, is not acceptable to us,  Krajisnik said and added: Perhaps this decision is some  misunderstanding, or it is purposeful, but one must know that  one percent of Sarajevo is worth five percent of some other part  of the Bosnian territory. We do not rule out any combination  and the Serbs will, to enable certain corrections, cede some  territory to the other side, but much less than the Muslims  think we will, he said and stressed: We will cede territory  because we want to show the world that we are for peace and  cooperation. We have shown this many times so far, but in  return our willingness to make concessions was interpreted as a  sign of weakness and offensives were then launched against us,  Krajisnik said and added, current Muslim attacks on Ozren and  provocations around Brcko are parts of the same scenario and if  they do not stop the Serbs will have to respond in kind.</p>

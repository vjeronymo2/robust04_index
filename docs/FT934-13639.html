			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Yeltsin's anti-graft chief to step down THE head of President Boris Yeltsin's anti-corruption commission yesterday said he was quitting and warned Russia's leaders not to miss a rare chance to tackle corruption. Mr Andrei Makarov, a prominent lawyer who plans to run for parliament, said he wanted to devote his time to politics. The recent appointment of Mr Andrei Kazannik as a new 'honest and competent' prosecutor-general after the suppression of the parliamentary uprising had also removed the need for the extraordinary commission, he said. But friends say the real reason for his departure is that he is pessimistic about the prospects for fighting corruption, and believes there are too many high-placed officials having a vested interest in seeing his commission disbanded. The commission was set up this summer after Mr Alexander Rutskoi, then vice-president, accused several ministers and close presidential aides of corruption. Mr Makarov rejected suggestions that his commission had settled political scores for Mr Yeltsin, saying that it had been created because the former prosecutor-general, Mr Valentin Stepankov, had been doing a one-sided job on behalf of Mr Yeltsin's enemies. The commission's work resulted in the sacking of Mr Victor Barannikov, security minister, and of Mr Andrei Dunayev, first deputy interior minister. Mr Barannikov was not among those accused by the vice-president, and he later joined him in the White House as security minister of a parallel government set up by parliament. While clearing the names of Mr Vladimir Shumeiko and Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, two close presidential aides accused by Mr Rutskoi, the commission also accused the vice-president himself of being 'associated' with a Swiss bank account. Before he leaves his post, Mr Makarov will submit proposals for a strategy to fight corruption relying heavily on economic reforms. Some are already being pushed through, such as liberalising of foreign trade to reduce the role of export licences and import subsidies, a serious source of graft.</p>

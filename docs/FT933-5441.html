			<p>930903 FT  03 SEP 93 / 5m workers exceed 48 hours a week MORE THAN 5m people, one fifth of all men and women in employment, work more than 48 hours a week, according to research published yesterday. This ranks the UK third, after Greece and Ireland, in an European Community league table according to a report in the Employment Gazette, the official publication of the Department of Employment. The department is fighting, in the European Court, the proposed EC working-time directive which proposes that employees work a maximum of 48 hours a week, with a statutory minimum paid annual holiday entitlement. The research shows that in all EC countries, except the UK, the majority of those working more than 48 hours are self-employed or work for their families.</p>

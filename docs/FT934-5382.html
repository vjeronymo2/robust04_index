			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Expanding ANS rises to Pounds 1.26m Associated Nursing Services, the nursing home operator, yesterday announced interim pre-tax profits ahead from Pounds 725,000 in the 28 weeks to October 10 1992 to Pounds 1.26m in the six months to September 30. Turnover advanced to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 7.23m) as the number of beds rose to 1,374 (1,245). ANS said the identification and publication of best practices across the company had helped reduce costs, improving operating margins from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. 'We looked at best practice in all of our homes and put together a single best practice document,' said Mr Tony Robinson, finance director. Controlling the wage bill had been a significant element, according to Mr Nick Dhandsa, chief executive. He said: 'Overall, I am very confident about the future.' An interim dividend of 0.5p (nil) is payable from earnings per share of 9p (6.6p). Mr Dhandsa said that the Care in the Community Act, introduced in April, had caused some delays to appraisals of potential residents, some of which had been politically motivated. Dudley in the West Midlands was the quickest, turning appraisals around within 5 days, while Liverpool's authorities were the slowest, the company said. There was also confusion between local authorities and health authorities over which were responsible for some elderly people's care. Net interest charges fell to Pounds 545,000 (Pounds 914,000) as total borrowings fell to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 17.1m).</p>

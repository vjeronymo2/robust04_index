Mr.  Clinton pointed out that a solution that is fair to both sides  can be found. Referring to the Cyprus issue, the U.S. President  expressed his intention to have personal contacts with both  interested parties, particularly with regard to the  confidence-building measures.    Responding to a question from journalists on President Bill  Clinton's letter to Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou,  Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos made the following  statement: President Clinton's letter to Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou was been sent in connection with the upcoming visit  by Mr. Andreas Papandreou to the United States and refers  concisely to all the issues that will be discussed. It is a  friendly and constructive letter that constitutes a serious  basis for discussion, given the U.S. intentions to address all  the problems and de-escalate tensions.    Answering another relevant question, the Government  spokesman  made it clear that the question of Turkish troops being sent to  Bosnia is not raised in the letter, while on the Skopje issue  President Clinton outlined the well-known U.S. positions, which  have also been expressed publicly.</p>

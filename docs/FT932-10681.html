			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Greencore shares suspended after possible rule breach SHARES in Greencore, the Irish sugar, malting and milling group, were suspended yesterday after it was disclosed that the placing of the Irish government's stake could have breached the company's articles of association. Davy Stockbrokers, adviser to the Irish government in the sale, said 4.45m of the 25m shares had been placed with institutions in which it had an interest and 2.5m had been placed with SG Warburg, which had agreed to partly underwrite the issue. Since Davys is part of the Bank of Ireland Group, which owns 15 per cent of Greencore through the Investment Bank of Ireland, the placing would breach the company's rules restricting holdings to a maximum of 15 per cent. The Irish Stock Exchange reacted by announcing an investigation. It comes less than a week after the Irish government said it had successfully disposed of its remaining 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore. Davys initially agreed that SG Warburg would underwrite the issue, subject to a maximum uptake of 10m shares, for which it would receive a commission of Pounds 250,000. When Davys only placed 17.5m of the shares, they entered into the arrangement with Warburg to take up the extra shares. They then revised that arrangement to include other purchasers. Warburg took 2.54m shares, its fee was cut to Pounds 100,000 and Davys agreed to shoulder any losses. Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, who yesterday gave an account of the transaction to the Irish parliament, said: 'I am seriously concerned and disappointed that important steps were taken by Davys without either my knowledge or agreement.' Greencore, formed from the privatised Irish sugar company, said Davys could still proceed with the placing if it was given permission to own more than 15 per cent. Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, said: 'The placing does not need to be unwound.' After taking legal advice Mr Murphy said contracts with institutions agreeing to buy shares in the placing were 'legally enforceable'. However, last night Davys was unsure whether the contracts could be enforced even if the company's 15 per cent maximum holding rule was circumvented. The company is privately furious that disposal of the Irish government's stake has incurred problems for a second time. The proposed deal was worth Pounds 68m, valuing the shares at 275p each. They were yesterday suspended at 272p. Robert Fleming, the company's adviser, had hoped to work on the sale, but the government decided Davys could handle it alone. ADM, the US food company, recently withdrew from talks to buy the stake.</p>

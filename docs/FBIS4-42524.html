			<p>BFN     [Text] Hamburg (DDP/ADN) -- The Hamburg police have banned  a demonstration planned for Saturday [4 June] by left-wing  Turkish groups outside the Turkish Consulate General because  clashes are feared. Police stated today that several Turkish and  Kurdish organizations have announced their participation in the  demonstration against the deportation of Iranian asylum-seekers  from Turkey to Iran. The ban is extended to substitute  demonstrations which have not yet been registered.    The ban has been imposed against the background of the  serious clashes between left- and right-wing Turks last weekend  when four people were injured. Three arson attacks were carried  out on Turkish establishments on Sunday, which police assume  were connected to the clashes.</p>

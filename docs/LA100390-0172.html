			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> DISCOVERY;  </P> <P> THE PLACENTIA TROLLEY  </P> <P> A mother and her twin toddler daughters rode to the Human Services Center  beside McFadden Park to pick up their 4-year-old brother from his preschool  Head Start class. An older woman, picked up outside the Villa de Palma Senior  Home, went to the market to shop for groceries. Three handicapped young men and  an instructor embarked at Tri-City Park on Golden Avenue for a morning's  outing.  </P> <P> All were passengers on Placentia's red-and-green trolley, a free public service  provided by the city. It travels 17 miles, makes 31 scheduled stops and  completes its loop route from the starting point at Melrose Street at McFadden  Park in an hour and 15 minutes. Passenger accommodations are maple-stained  wooden seats resembling park benches, attached to the floor by wrought-iron  legs painted green.  </P> <P> Among the trolley stops are the Civic Center (City Hall and the Placentia  Library), the post office, the Placentia-Linda Community Hospital, all city  parks and all the shopping centers. It also calls at the senior citizen centers  and mobile home parks. Drivers keep to the schedule within a grace period of 15  minutes, allowing whatever time passengers need to embark or disembark.  </P> <P> In its first few months after October, 1989, when trolley service began, most  people traveled just for the ride and the tour of the city. Today, the trolley  has been integrated into the city's life. Passengers include employees bound  for work, mothers taking their children to school, senior citizens running  errands, young people destined for the parks, and the occasional tourist out to  see the sights.  </P> <P> The trolley provides a valuable service not only for local residents but for  some of the county's disabled as well. The Cole Vocational program, which works  with adults who have either mental or physical disabilities, utilizes the  Placentia trolley in its community integration lessons.  </P> <P> "The trolley ride teaches (these adults) independence in the community, teaches  them what resources are available," said program manager Susan Dinkel. "It  allows them to be exposed to people in a social situation." In this  non-threatening environment, "they can be integrated and be accepted."  </P> <P> The number of daily riders has risen from an average of 24 in November, 1989,  to an average of 60 or more in the spring and summer months. "The season drops  off for riders" after the summer, trolley driver Lois Hasell explained in  conversation with a passenger.  </P> <P> The lack of direct revenue from the trolley appears to be no serious hardship  for the city. Cecil Rospaw, vice chairman of the Placentia Historical  Committee, went so far as to say that it may be paying for itself. "Look at the  sales tax figures for Placentia -- up 6%," he said.  </P> <P> The trolley represents two things, Rospaw said. "Every person who rides is not  driving a car; and every person who rides will make purchases that end up  helping the city."  </P> <P> The city trolley, he says, is "a good example of a very good solution."  </P> <P> Hours: 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday; 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday. Does  not run on Sunday.  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 993-8245  </P> <P> Miscellaneous Information: The ride is free. Trolley schedules (including a map  showing the route) are available at City Hall, 401 E. Chapman Ave., and on the  trolley. ELENA BRUNET  </P></p>

Non-Federal analytical laboratories are qualified under the ALP to conduct analyses of official meat and poultry samples. Laboratory accreditation fees that cover the costs of the ALP are mandated by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (the 1990 Farm Bill), as amended. The same Act mandates annual payment of the fees on the anniversary date of each accreditation. FSIS has determined that reduced ALP administrative expenditures for fiscal year 1995 will enable the Agency to charge a smaller accreditation fee than last year. However, because the laboratory accreditation fee is set forth in the regulations, the regulations must be changed before the Agency can charge a different fee. Since the anniversary date of most current accreditations is December 13, FSIS would like to begin billing the laboratories at the reduced rate on that date. FSIS is also making an editorial correction to the Federal meat and poultry products inspection regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> December 27, 1994.

Analyses are also conducted to determine the presence of any violative concentrations of drugs or other chemical residues. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When FSIS finds that a product is not in compliance, the Agency is required to take appropriate action against the processor of that product. Depending on the type of product and the severity of the noncompliance, such action may range from product reprocessing to litigation proceedings. In view of the critical nature of product testing, it is necessary for laboratories that analyze official samples of meat and poultry products to maintain a high degree of integrity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A processor whose sample is to be analyzed generally has the option of using either an FSIS laboratory or an accredited laboratory. The cost of FSIS analysis is borne by the Government while the cost of non-Federal analysis is borne by the processor. Due to the limited number of FSIS laboratories and their heavy workload, many processors prefer to use the non-Federal laboratories either for convenience of location or to obtain test results more quickly. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Tougher scrutiny for retail developers Mr John Gummer, envi-ronment secretary, yesterday signalled tougher scrutiny of planning applications for out-of-town retail developments, with the aim of 'putting the heart back' into cities. He told the Town and Country Planning Association's annual seminar on planning and development control that he had 'decided to take a rather closer interest in retail proposals outside the main shopping areas of our main towns and cities'. Mr Gummer said he had asked the department and its regional offices to notify him of all developments that would affect the quality of towns and cities. He added that he would be looking at the response of local authorities and retailers to the government's planning policy guidance issued in July. If the guidelines were not being followed he would consider strengthening them. The guidelines are aimed at encouraging retail investment in town centres to slow the drift of retailing from town centres to edge-of-own or out-of-town shopping centres and superstores. But there has been confusion over how they should be interpreted. Mr Tony Baldry, environment minister, sought to end the confusion in November, when he said the government expected retailers and developers 'to look first at town centres'. Mr Gummer has made it clear several times that he feels very strongly about the need to protect town centres from being damaged by out-of-town retail developments. The environment department said yesterday that it was too early to tell whether the guidelines were having an effect, but added that Mr Gummer wanted to emphasise that he would strengthen them if necessary. That would have important implications for out-of-town retail developers, and for superstore operators who are still spending billions of pounds in total each year on expansion, mainly into edge-of-town and out-of-town locations.</p>

			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (5): Close to 50 million users already - Worldwide demand for cellular mobile communications / In Europe, the Global System for Mobile Communications - GSM for short - has become the driving force behind the growth of cellular subscriptions worldwide Europe tends to borrow most of its ideas about telecommunications products and services from North America. But in mobile communications, Europe has seized the initiative and US companies are doing the unthinkable - they are giving some serious thought to importing a European-developed technology. The pan-European GSM digital cellular telephone standard has been adopted by every country in western Europe. GSM is likely to be used across the whole of eastern Europe and is already emerging as the dominant technology in Asia and North Africa. Since the first GSM telephones were produced in the summer of 1992, more than three million people, most of them in western Europe, have signed up to GSM services. There are almost twice as many cellular telephone subscribers in the US as in the whole of western Europe. If current growth levels are maintained, there will be 22m US cellular subscribers and 13m European subscribers by the end of this year. The worldwide cellular population will be close to 50m. But while more than half of the European growth this year will be derived from new connections to GSM digital cellular systems, US growth is accounted for almost exclusively by connections to analogue Amps networks which are close to reaching full capacity. A number of operators have upgraded their networks to offer digital services, but there is little or no customer interest because telephones are more expensive and coverage levels are inferior. US cellular operators will face competition in 1995 or 1996 from personal communications service (PCS) companies. They will use high frequencies at a similar part of the spectrum to those allocated to the UK cellular operators, Mercury One-2-One and Orange, and E-Plus in Germany. But they have to decide whether to use the same standard as the European operators, or a standard that is developed in the US. There is every chance that they will choose the European standard - which is based on GSM - because it is a proven technology, and because manufacturers can guarantee prompt delivery and are beginning to derive the economies of scale to make PCS handsets cheap enough to compete with the analogue networks. 'There is an awful lot of interest in DCS 1800,' acknowledges Dale Hatfied, the managing director of US telecommunications consultancy Hatfield Associates. There will be three PCS licensees in each region and DCS 1800 would be an attractive choice of technology because it gives an operator the opportunity to beat its competitors to the market - 'with all the PCS licences that are being issued, there is a big advantage in being first to the market,' says the consultancy. It believes that, in the longer term, spread spectrum technology, developed by US company Qualcomm, could emerge as the optimal digital cellular standard. But the handset technology is still under development, and a PCS operator which chooses spread spectrum technology risks being left behind in the race to build new networks. While the whole of Europe is migrating from analogue cellular to digital GSM over a period of two to three years, the US cellular industry is pulling in a number of different directions and away from a standardised technical approach - 'we have chaos over here in the US,' observes Hatfield. But Europe has not always acted in such a unified manner: before GSM, cellular telephone networks in Europe operated to a number of different standards. Germany and France, for example, chose technologies which were unique to their markets. It was this disharmony and the licensing of competing operators - rather than the merits of the GSM standard - which has helped to make GSM such a significant success for Europe. When the two German GSM networks, D1 and D2, launched in June 1992, the old Deutsche Telekom C-Netz analogue network was creaking under the weight of new subscriptions. The quality of the service was very low by US standards and handsets were even more expensive than the new GSM telephones. Germany, therefore, became the focus of attention for GSM equipment manufacturers. If Germany had not provided the impetus to get GSM off the ground, Europe could have experienced the same sort of difficulties in engineering the market to upgrade to digital services as the US. GSM also owes its success to the opening up of European markets to competition. Most countries in Europe retained monopolies until the GSM standard was developed. The licensing of competitors co- incided with the arrival of GSM, resulting in a massive surge in demand for cellular telephones. The number of cellular subscribers in western Europe, which had grown by roughly a third in each of the two previous years, increased by 47 per cent in 1993. The successful launch in Europe helped GSM to make the transition from a European to a global standard. Asia, in particular, has turned to GSM as a successor to analogue networks, many of which are close to full capacity. In Hong Kong, GSM is now capturing the majority of new subscriptions, largely because GSM handsets are 25 per cent cheaper than analogue models. GSM services have also been launched, or networks are being built, in Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia. GSM is also emerging as the favoured standard in Africa where many countries have no previous experience of cellular networks. Two new operators, Mobile Telephone Network and Vodacom, launched GSM services in South Africa in June and already share more than 100,000 subscribers. The whole of North Africa is also adopting GSM. A rapid fall in the price of cellular telephones has been a big factor in the success of GSM. When services were first launched in northern Europe in 1992, the wholesale price of telephone was between Pounds 600 and Pounds l,000. This did not matter in Germany, where telephones for the old C-Nets service were even more expensive. But in the UK, where retailers were already selling hand- portable telephones for the Tacs analogue networks for less than Pounds 100, GSM could not compete. But since 1992, the wholesale price of GSM telephones has fallen to Pounds 250 for a bottom-of-the-range model, to around Pounds 500 for a pocket telephone. Dealers heavily discount the price of telephones because they receive cash bonuses for each new subscriber they connect to their network. In Germany and the UK, these bonuses are so large that some dealers are giving away telephones provided that the subscriber signs up to a service for a minimum period. GSM is proving a remarkable success for the western European telecommunications sector. It has become the driving force behind the growth of cellular subscriptions worldwide and is now threatening to make an impact in the US, the world's biggest cellular market.

These activities must use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults, who are deaf and hard of hearing with those who can hear while conducting cultural experiences that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During FY 1992 the Department funded projects that: (1) Provided theatrical experiences for deaf and hard of hearing individuals, and (2) used integrated approaches by having among  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cast members a mixture of deaf, hard of hearing and hearing performers. During FY 1993 cultural experiences were extended specifically to younger people with hearing impairments and to the creation of art as well as theatrical experiences, using the same approaches. Projects under this proposed priority can include a variety of artistic approaches such as the creation of works of art (painting, drawing, designing, etc.), dance, and storytelling, as well as developing and performing dramatic productions. A grantee  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> may not  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> use funds under this priority for passive activities such as viewing a play or video, or passively watching a storyteller or artist at work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To be considered for funding under this priority, a project must_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Use an integrated approach that mixes children, youth, and adults who are deaf and hard of hearing, with those who are hearing in carrying out project activities; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Develop and implement strategies that will increase public awareness and understanding of deafness and other hearing impairments and of the artistic and intellectual achievements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals, including children, youth, and adults. Outreach activities such as promoting the project to schools, community organizations, news media, and relevant national organizations are encouraged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Invitational Priority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within this absolute priority 2, the Secretary is particularly interested in applications that meet the following invitational priority.

Activities under this priority include, but are not limited to: (1) A computerized user-registration process; (2) circulation of captioned films and videos; (3) development or updating of a catalog of captioned films and videos in the collection; and (4) outreach activities.

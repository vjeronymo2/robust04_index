			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: EC airlines Given the failure of earlier EC efforts to break up Europe's airline cartel, it is scarcely surprising that the latest liberalisation package has earned a sceptical response. With open skies now postponed until 1997 to accommodate more fearful member states, it is fair to assume that this week's agreement will have little immediate impact. It would be silly, though, to belittle its long-term significance. For reasons that are hard to fathom, airlines arouse much the same sensitivity as national currencies; so much so that the prospect of full cabotage rights ever being accepted seemed inconceivable until quite recently. The pressure for rationalisation, mergers and cost savings in Europe's fragmented air transport industry will now greatly intensify. Politicians will doubtless continue to drag their heels, but will ultimately have to accept a measure of global branding. For the moment, of course, the new freedoms will mean little, not least because the EC's infrastructure is in a mess. The problem of airport slots for newcomers has not been addressed in this week's package, though it remains the subject of separate negotiation. The decentralised air traffic control system - a further block to extra capacity - is not likely to be improved much before 1995. These constraints, quite apart from their generally parlous financial condition, explain why airlines are unlikely to launch instant price wars. They will presumably only do so when able to offset lower fares with bigger volumes.</p>

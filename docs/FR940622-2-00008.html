			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on findings in the LTFV investigation that home market sales of the subject merchandise were made by Akzo at prices below the cost of production (COP), the Department conducted a cost investigation for this administrative review. We examined whether home market sales were made below cost in substantial quantities over an extended period of time, and whether such sales were made at prices which permitted recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade. We calculated Akzo's COP on a model-specific basis as the sum of all reported materials costs, labor expenses, factory overhead, selling expenses, net interest expense, and revised general and administrative expenses. We reallocated general and administrative costs as a percentage of cost of goods sold. We compared COP to home market prices, net of movement charges, third-party payments, packing, rebates, and discounts. Based upon this comparison, we found that there were sales below cost. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where we determined that less than 10 percent of the home market sales of rayon yarn of a particular model were sold at prices below the COP, we did not disregard any sales of that model in our calculation of FMV. If 10 percent or more, but not more than 90 percent, of the home market sales of a particular model of rayon yarn were below cost, we excluded the below-cost home market sales prices from our calculation of FMV, provided that these below-cost home market sales were made over an extended period of time. For those models where more than 90 percent of the home market sales were made below cost over an extended period of time, we disregarded all home market sales of those models from our calculation of FMV and used the constructed value of those models as described below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To determine whether sales below cost were made over an extended period of time, we compared the number of months in which sales below cost occurred for a particular model to the number of months in which that model was sold. If the model was sold in fewer than three months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there were below-cost sales of that model in each month sold. If a model was sold in three or more months, we did not disregard below-cost sales unless there were sales below cost in at least three of the months in which the model was sold. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Akzo has not submitted information indicating that any of its sales below cost were made at prices which would have permitted ``recovery of all costs within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of trade,'' as required by section 773(b)(2) of the Act. Therefore, we have no basis for concluding that the costs of production of such sales have been recovered within a reasonable period of time. As a result of our investigation, we disregarded Akzo's below-cost sales made over an extended period of time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> December 24, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPIRITUAL BENEFITS  </P> <P> I fail to understand the logic of the biased headline "Religion is Big Business  at the Shrine of Lourdes" (Dec. 3), based on the article by Phillippe Naughton.  I had the privilege of visiting Lourdes twice, spending up to 12 hours a day in  prayer and public devotions -- even forgoing lunch in order to treasure each  spiritual moment.  </P> <P> Pilgrims visiting Lourdes are there for the spiritual benefits. In the  religious domain of Lourdes, one may obtain blessed candles and mass offerings  can be made. Neither is obligatory and there are no collections. The church has  nothing to do with the commercial aspects outside the grotto grounds.  </P> <P> ARTHUR J. MAGONE  </P> <P> Honolulu, Hawaii  </P></p>

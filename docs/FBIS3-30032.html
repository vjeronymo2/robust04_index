			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shigeo Masui] </F>   [Text] New York, 19 Feb -- "It is better to have reached  no agreement than to have reached an empty agreement." This was  what President Bill Clinton stated positively at the recent  Japan-U.S. summit talks. However, YOMIURI SHIMBUN's New York  Bureau recently obtained a document that clearly indicates how  the President decided on taking a hard line against Japan. The  document entitled "Repairing the U.S.-Japan Relationship" was  written by Glen S. Fukushima, vice chairman of the Chamber of  Commerce and Industry [of American businessmen] in Japan.  Fukushima, who is currently head of the Comprehensive Policy  Department of AT&amp;T in Japan and a former USTR official in  charge  of Japanese affairs, is no stranger to the backstage activities  of Japan-U.S. talks on such issues as rice and automobiles. The  President himself read through the 12-page report, and wrote on  it such comments as "worth reading," "to the point," and "needs  to be discussed." Here and there in the document are underlined  sections with a note stating "agree."    Included in this report are an analysis of the current  Japan-U.S. relationship, a frank criticism of the Clinton  administration's policy toward Japan, and suggestions for future  strategy in dealing with Japan. The report was handed to the  president by Prof. Derek Shearer [name as published] of the  Occidental University, who has been an intimate friend of the  President since their student years. The President studied the  report on 20 January. Reportedly, the copy of the report with  the President's comments was returned to Fukushima through Prof.  Shearer.    At the same time, President Clinton gave instructions that  copies of this report, bearing the initial "B (Bill)," should be  distributed to 10 officials, including USTR Mickey Kantor,  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Undersecretary Roger  Altman, and Anthony Lake, assistant to the President for  national security affairs. What is noteworthy is that the  so-called pro-Japanese group at the State Department, which  oversees Japan-U.S. security issues, was excluded.    The returned report indicates the President read it  intensively. In particular, the comment "agree" was written in  two places in the report. One place is where the report  concludes it is "wrong" to say that "Japan will go down  [shizumu]," a comment that has been conspicuous in recent news  coverage. It continues by stating the "depression may last  longer than expected," but "since the foundations of the  Japanese economy are not impaired, it will be able to make a  comeback as the strongest rival once again."    The other place is where the report makes the following  criticism: "In dealing with the issue of Japan's opening up of  its market, the Clinton administration does not seem to  understand when, where, and to what degree it should impose  pressure to induce the maximum results while trying to keep  Japanese indignation to the minimum." This portion is not only  underlined but also marked "agree."    There are as many as 15 portions underlined. For example,  "An administration's failure to take any concrete action is  regarded in Japan as weakness, not as tolerance," or "Even if  the two countries reach an accord, problems are bound to arise  in a couple of months because of interpretation of the  language." In this way, the report also gives instructions that  in the event that an accord is reached, Japanese and English  vocabulary used in the accord should be clarified to Japanese  and American reporters.</p>

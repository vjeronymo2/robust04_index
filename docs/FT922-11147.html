			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Trade News: 'Textbook' pact cuts US-Canada beer trade curbs THE North American beer market is expected to become more competitive and more integrated, after a landmark US-Canada agreement to dismantle several long-standing trade barriers. The agreement, the culmination of years of wrangling, is widely seen as a textbook example of the potential benefits of liberalised trade to business and consumers. The compromise was reached last weekend after each country had threatened to impose stiff duties on beer imports from the other. Mr Peter Clark, an adviser to the Brewers' Association of Canada, said yesterday the changes would mean significant economies of scale in the Canadian industry. By giving US brewers easier access to the Canadian market, the agreement steps up pressure on Canadian provinces to drop restrictive practices which have contributed to high costs for Canadian brewers. Lower production costs would enable the industry to bring down domestic prices, and spur it to expand export markets. Under the agreement, Canadian provinces will drop discriminatory mark-ups on US beer by June 30. British Columbia, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland will also no longer set a minimum price for beer imports, linked to the minimum for domestic brands. Ontario is to rescind its requirement that US beer be sold only in six-packs. A key element of the pact will require beer stores in Ontario and British Columbia, and grocery stores in Quebec, to start stocking US beer by September 30, 1993. Imported beer is now sold only through provincially owned liquor outlets. US brewers have only a 3 per cent share of Canadian consumption, but US beer is about 30 per cent cheaper in the key Ontario market than Canadian brands. By gaining access to beer stores, the US makers will be able to compete more directly against Canadian beer. The cost discrepancy is largely due to provincial rules barring sales of any domestic beers not produced in the province. These curbs are expected to end on July 1. Meanwhile, the industry is pressing for permission to rationalise production of individual brands across the country. Brewers are also pressing barley producers for lower prices, and asking the federal government to improve their cash flows by changing the point at which excise taxes are levied. The Canadian industry hopes the accord will speed talks to end US federal and state curbs against foreign beers. These include discriminatory excise taxes and onerous distribution requirements. A Gatt panel, responding to complaints by the EC and Canada, has called for these barriers to be scrapped.</p>

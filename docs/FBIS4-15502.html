			<p>BFN     [Text] Russian Ambassador in Latvia Aleksandr Rannikh  extended in Riga Thursday Moscow's official apologies due to the  "misunderstanding" around President Yeltsin's order to create  military bases outside the Russian Federation.    Earlier the news media said that by his order Yeltsin backed  the initiative by the Russian Defense Ministry on the creation  of military bases in the CIS countries and Latvia.    Addressing on the same day a briefing in Riga, the Russian  Ambassador admitted that there was "a technical mistake" which  was detrimental to the Russian-Latvian relations and made  difficult the political dialogue.    Rannikh said that he had doubt about the origin of the  document. He said that the Russian Embassy in Riga did not  receive the official report from Moscow that the document was  signed and was in force.    He believes that Latvia's negative reaction to the document  was caused by the tense situation caused by preparations being  under way for the signing of the Latvian-Russian agreements on  the Russian troop pull-out.    Rannikh also confirmed that all problems associated with the  pull-out and the conditions of the temporary deployment and  status of the radar station in Skrunda were solved and the  documents were initialed by the chief negotiators of the two  countries on March 15.    According to the agreement, the Russian radar in Skrunda is  a  Russian military facility which is under the civilian control  and cannot be regarded as a military base.</p>

Contingent upon the outcome of the review process, grant awards will be made in such a manner as to achieve a distribution of resources throughout the country. Special consideration will be given to applicants that received Section 330(c) planning grant funds in FY 1993 to assist in their development of a new CHC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other Award Information: All grants to be awarded under this notice are subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100, which allows States the option of setting up a system for reviewing applications from within their States for assistance under certain Federal programs. The application kit will contain a listing of States which have chosen to set up a review system and will identify a State Single Point of Contact (SPOC) in each State for the review. Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal governments) should contact their SPOCs as early as possible to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any necessary instructions on State process. For proposed projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to contact the SPOC of each affected State. State process recommendations should be submitted to the appropriate Regional Office (see Appendix). The due date for State process recommendations is 60 days after the appropriate application deadline date. The Bureau of Primary Health Care does not guarantee that it will accommodate or explain its response to State process recommendations received after this date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public Health System Reporting Requirement: These programs are subject to the Public Health System Reporting Requirement, PHS Circular 92.01. Reporting requirements have been approved by the OMB_0937&hyph;0195. Under this requirement, the community-based nongovernmental applicant must prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement (PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed health services grant applications submitted by community-based nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Community-based nongovernmental applicants are required to submit the following information to the head of the appropriate State and local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than the Federal application receipt due date: (1) a copy of the face page of the application (SF 424); and (2) a summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page, which provides a description of the population to be served, a summary of the services to be provided and a description of the coordination planned with the appropriate State or local health agencies. In the OMB Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance, the number for the Community Health Center program is listed as 93.224  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> John H.

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Top Danish bank to cut more jobs DEN DANSKE Bank, Denmark's largest bank, plans to reduce employment by 20 per cent over the next three years in order to cut costs and improve earnings, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. However, Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive, said yesterday the bank made a DKr1.33bn (Dollars 208.5m) net profit in 1991 compared with a loss of DKr1.17bn in 1990. The improvement reflected a reduction in loss provisions from DKr4.25bn to DKr2.88bn and a DKr1.7bn gain from the adjustment of the value of foreign exchange and securities portfolios. The bank proposed an unchanged 16 per cent dividend, a pay-out of DKr847m. Net interest income and income from fees and commissions declined to DKr9.82bn from DKr10.22bn, which Mr Sorensen described as 'unsatisfactory'. He attributed it to a trend which had lasted for several years and was caused by increasing competition and the domestic economic recession. Danske is the result of a merger of three large banks in 1990. Since then, the branch network has been reduced from 750 to about 600, and further reductions are on the way. Employment has been reduced by about 9 per cent from 16,400 at the time of the merger to 15,000. The number must be reduced to 12,000 by the end of 1994, said Mr Sorensen.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 21, 16-22 May </F> 94]    [Text] The mid-April GATT meeting in Morocco, which was  attended by delegations of about 140 member nations, resulted in  signing an agreement on institution of the World Trade  Organisation [WTO] which ushered in a new era of global trade,  tariff, custom, investment and other economic relations.  Henceforth, GATT/WTO will assume UN-like dimensions with its  member nations accounting for over 90 per cent of global trade  turn-over.    The so multitudinous membership leaves but a handful of  nations outside the GATT/WTO structure. Nineteen more nations  are presently officializing their accedence to it, Russia,  Belarus and Ukraine included.    Russia started the process on 16 June 1993. Ukraine, who  assumed the GATT observer status on 14 July 1992, started its  similar process of accedence to GATT only on 17 December 1993.  Russia is widely expected to accede to GATT/WTO as a  full-fledged member before 1994 elapses. Ukraine is only  drafting its memorandum of foreign trade, the key document  necessary for accedence to GATT.    According to Serhiy Osyka, Ukraine's Deputy Minister for  foreign economic relations and GATT permanent representative,  the longer Ukraine contents itself with the role of an outsider,  the more difficult the process will be of normalizing its trade  and economic relations with GATT/WTO member nations including  Ukraine's neighbors, Russia and Belarus.    The Ukrainian official sounds very pessimistic on Ukraine's  bilateral economic agreements and their efficiency in Ukraine  gaining the MFN [Most-Favored Nation] status, which invariably  presupposes full-fledged GATT membership.    Mr. Osyka urges top priority to be assigned by the Ukrainian  leadership to Ukraine's accedence to GATT/WTO, moreover so that  the world community is ready and willing to assist Ukraine is so  doing.    The Ukrainian delegation to GATT is reported to have stepped  up of late its efforts toward the speediest possible  officialization of Ukraine's accedence to GATT/WTO.    Technical aid to Ukraine may assume a more tangible  dimension, when Ukraine's interdepartmental commission for  accedence to GATT/WTO visits Washington, DC, in early June.    A visit is also contemplated to be paid to Kiev by a team of  experts with the US mission to Geneva and officers of the GATT  Secretariat for meetings with top Ukrainian officials in late  May.</p>

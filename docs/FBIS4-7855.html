			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by "U.K.:" "Report on Integration; Poland-European </F> Union"]    [Text] Minister Jacek Saryusz-Wolski, the  government's plenipotentiary for European integration and  foreign assistance, presented the Sejm Commission for European  Integration with a report on the implementation of a program of  measures aimed at adapting the Polish economy and legal system  to EU requirements.    The report, which was prepared on the basis of reports by  individual ministries, deals with, among other things, the  status of the adaptation and integration processes in the areas  of the law and the economy, organizationally and institutionally.    "The program has not been and is not supposed to be  something for its own sake but, instead, is the outline of a  process whose scope and pace can be modified depending on  changes occurring in both Poland and the EU," Minister  Saryusz-Wolski said.    Among the adaptation measures, Poland's legal system has  been  dealt with as a priority, including measures dealing with the  Customs Law, the Banking Law, the law on the protection of  industrial and intellectual property, and the environmental  protection law. This resulted in 38 scientific studies having  been written by famous experts from all branches of law. One  hundred and sixty draft laws were also reviewed from the  standpoint of their conformity with European law.    In terms of long-term measures, experts are being trained,  among other things, for cooperation with the European  Communities, and work is being conducted on establishing  institutional foundations for cooperation between Polish  universities and prestigious schools of higher education in the  West.    The Sejm deputies did not evaluate the working report  because  it will be debated at subsequent sessions by the commission. It  was agreed that agriculture will be one of the first topics. As  is well known, the biggest problem lies in adapting legal  provision in force in Poland to EU requirements.</p>

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / World Trade News: EU will need telecoms watchdog, says top official A European telecommunications regulator will be needed to underpin the liberalisation of the European Union's telecoms market, Mr Michel Carpentier, the head of the EU's telecommunications directorate, warned yester-day. Referring to the 1998 deadline for the introduction of competition for 'voice' services over the EU's public networks, he stressed that 'mechanisms to handle problems of a Community-wide nature will be needed.' The Commission was anxious to respect the principle of subsidiarity, leaving as much as possible to national governments and regulators, said Mr Carpentier, addressing the FT's world telecommunications conference. However, 'issues such as the resolution of inter-connection disputes between telecommunications organisations in different member states and the mutual recognition of licences cannot by their nature be handled by one member state or one regulator acting alone.' The issue of mutual recognition of licences is likely to be particularly difficult to resolve. US regional Bell companies are licensed to operate cable networks in the UK and AT&amp;T has a licence application pending in London. Mr Carpentier said there was a clear 'infrastructure gap' for corporate communications on the continent, which would 'rapidly close if the possibility for alternative infrastructure existed.' He said most EU states had 'little enthusiasm' for an early introduction of competition in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure, a policy strongly advocated by the UK government. Mr Carpentier described the alliance between France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, announced this week, as an 'unsurprising' reaction to deregulation and the growth of an international market for telecommunications out-sourcing. Mr James Quello, a senior commissioner at the US Federal Communications Commission, said the rise of 'multimedia' alliances between telecommunications, cable, entertainment and computing companies posed stark challenges to regulatory authorities. 'At a time of rapidly changing technology and markets, the regulator should not handicap service provision by establishing artificially restrictive parameters.' Mr Michael Gale, managing director of Hong Kong Telecom, estimated the Asia-Pacific region would need about 200m new phone lines in the next decade  -equivalent to nearly 10 BT networks. He said they would be paid for partly from supplier credits and own resources, but would rely heavily on equity investment by western operators.</p>

			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Harare to allow foreign exchange bank accounts ZIMBABWE is changing its currency regulations to let citizens and foreigners hold bank accounts in foreign exchange with no questions asked, according to Mr Kombo Moyana, central bank governor, Reuter reports from Harare. 'Capital brought into the FCDA (foreign currency denominated account) will not be subject to tax and proof of sources will not be required,' he said. 'As an incentive, no withholding tax will be levied on the interest earned by these accounts.' President Robert Mugabe flew to London this week to campaign for investment from British business leaders. He was expected to announce changes to foreign exchange rules, which investors see as a curb on their presence. A long-standing ban on foreign businesses investing on the local stock market was abolished in April. They are now allowed to remit most of their profits. The Zimbabwean economy shrank by 12 per cent last year. Economists expect it to decline again this year.</p>

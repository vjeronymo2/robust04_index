			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (23): The long search for a super fibre  -David Fishlock finds Rolls-Royce worried by the level of its R&amp;D support ROLLS-ROYCE'S two big international rivals in the aero-engine business - General Electric and Pratt &amp; Whitney - receive R&amp;D support from the US government amounting to Dollars 760m a year, Sir Ralph Robins told a Commons select committee in March. The Rolls-Royce chairman complained: 'There is no doubt that the level of US government support to its industry makes life very difficult for us.' His company has received about the same sum from the UK government as launch aid for civil aircraft, but spread over 21 years. Unlike the US support, launch aid is reimbursable. Rolls-Royce will pay back nearly Pounds 500m between now and the year 2001, Sir Ralph forecasts. Mr Stewart Miller, Rolls-Royce's chief engineer and director of engineering technology, expands on his chairman's worries in respect of advanced aerospace materials. 'After efficiency, materials are just as important as ever they were to the designer, and ultimately efficiency will be limited by materials,' he says. Essentially, the big engineering challenges are to drive pressures and temperatures higher and, at the same time, make the engines lighter. It is an obvious application for 'simultaneous engineering' for the properties of the promising new aerospace materials are linked irrevocably to the way components are made. Use of steel, for example, has been declining steadily from 60 per cent of engine weight in 1960 (the Tyne) to about 15 per cent today, and is still falling. Use of nickel has peaked at about 45 per cent and can be expected to fall sharply. Three new types of material are expected to increase their 'market share' rapidly. For lower temperatures they are the resin-based composites of the type Rolls tried but failed to introduce with its carbon-fibre fan blade in the 1960s. For higher temperatures they are the metal matrix composites - metal reinforced with ceramic fibres - that promise to take weight out of rotating parts. And there are the ceramic matrix composites - 'the big prize', as Mr Miller sees it. Ceramic matrix composites promise to eliminate the elaborate cooling arrangements now needed for high-temperature rotating metal parts. 'But it's extraordinarily difficult,' he admits. Mr Miller confesses he has been guilty of undue optimism about when such materials will be ready to fly. Five years ago the company saw the challenge as a 10-year project, giving it a new engineering material by the end of the century. 'It's going to take longer than that.' The core problem is corrosion: how, when running engines at 1,500 degrees C  -the melting point of steel - to prevent the fibrous reinforcement from simply dissolving in its white-hot matrix. The answer is probably a protective coating for the fibre, to create a 'super fibre' in terms of high-temperature strength and corrosion resistance. Identifying the combination that will eventually win a licence to fly is going to be a long and costly quest. Mr Miller is betting on coated alumina (aluminium oxide) fibres getting there first. But a big difficulty is that there are no UK suppliers of super fibres. The volume of business promised by Rolls-Royce is small compared with the scale of investment required, and the lead time to commercial use is long. This problem has driven Rolls-Royce into a Eureka pre-competitive research collaboration involving some 30 European organisations. The first, four-year phase of this programme, starting this year, aims to identify a suitable coated fibre for service at 1,500 degrees C. Rolls-Royce is contributing about Pounds 0.5m, which will be backed pound for pound by the government. The obvious risk for the company - and Britain - is that results will be freely available to a rival aero-engine maker. Rolls-Royce spends over Pounds 200m a year of its own on research, development and demonstration. Figures given by Sir Ralph to the select committee suggest three major sources of public support for its two US competitors: from the US Department of Defense's science and research budget - Dollars 400m a year; from research and demonstration programmes jointly funded by DoD and Nasa - Dollars 160m a year; from recovery of R&amp;D costs by companies charging their R&amp;D to the overhead account on contracts - Dollars 200m a year. In France, says Rolls-Royce, the principal state support for civil aero-engine programmes is launch aid for Snecma, GE's state-owned collaborator. Snecma gets reimbursable loans amounting to Pounds 240m (1990 prices) over 10 years for the GE 90 programme, a direct competitor to Rolls-Royce's Trent. In Japan, says Rolls-Royce, Miti has identified aeronautics as the most important 'sunrise' industry of the 21st century. In 1983 the Japanese government launched a R&amp;D programme involving about 170 companies to develop engineering ceramics. R-R believes this has given Nippon Carbon a commanding position in carbon fibre production and use. Japan began test runs of an industrial gas turbine made of ceramic components in 1990. Its aim, says Mr Miller, is to develop an 'all-composite engine'. Its commercial goal is to supply advanced engine component technology, giving this the status of, say, avionic systems in future generations of aircraft. Two other companies - Nippon Chemicals and UBE Chemicals - are also concentrating on fibre development and manufacture for reinforcing composite materials. Although Mr Miller acknowledges that the development of high duty composite materials is proving more difficult and expensive than was expected a few years ago, 'our belief in the value of composite materials is as strong as ever it was. 'The weight savings are potentially enormous,' he asserts. For example, it may be possible to design a composite compressor wheel with integral blades only half the weight of the metal version. But where once sights were set on such critical parts as turbine blades, less critical components are now being targeted. Rolls-Royce participated in the Eureka programme, but Mr Miller believes that so crucial is advanced aero-engine materials technology that Britain should be prepared to pursue this one alone. Last year Rolls-Royce proposed a national composite materials R&amp;D programme involving its suppliers and universities, with government support of about Pounds 50m a year. The US government, says Mr Miller, spends more - Dollars 150m a year for composite materials R&amp;D. As Sir Ralph told MPs: 'A new family of materials is coming to revolutionise aviation and its first application will be on engines.' Unless Rolls-Royce remained at the forefront of composite materials technology the company risked losing out, its chairman warned.</p>

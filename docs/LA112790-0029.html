			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> THE BUREAUCRAT WHO GOT PATTON HIS TANKS;  </P> <P> LUCIUS D. CLAY; AN AMERICAN LIFE BY JEAN EDWARD SMITH; HENRY HOLT: $29.95; 812  PAGES  </P> <P> He was a new type of soldier, a master of warfare at mid-century. One of a  remarkable band of similar men and women, he was a chair-borne bureaucrat, the  great, often-scorned weapon that assured the Allied victory in World War II.  </P> <P> No battlefield honors for men such as Lucius D. Clay, West Point 1918, first in  English and history, 128th out of 137 in military conduct.  </P> <P> Instead, autocratic, independent Lucius Clay found his way into the Corps of  Engineers, and ultimately to Washington. There he dealt with a pork-barrel  Congress, scattering vast river, harbor and dam projects about the country. He  cooperated generously with the New Deal's Civilian Conservation Corps and Works  Progress Administration in civilian relief -- and gained even more experience  in managing huge enterprises.  </P> <P> (According to one of his sponsors, then-Sen. James Byrnes: Were Clay given six  months, "he could run General Motors or U.S. Steel.")  </P> <P> For 20 years, Clay and a small group of like-minded men gathered those  political and managerial skills necessary to mobilize an army of 9 million when  the nation finally roused itself to the menace of Hitler.  </P> <P> No Patton here. Only the deputy director of war mobilization who got Patton his  tanks, Eaker his bombers, and Bradley, Clark and MacArthur their Jeeps and  C-rations. This is dull stuff, but it was that very logistical capacity of the  United States that won the war.  </P> <P> Still, logistics is not the sort of thing to transfix a biographer for the two  decades that University of Toronto political scientist Jean Edward Smith has  spent on this book. Rather, it is Clay's tenure as military governor of Germany  in the immediate postwar era, during four years of increasing Cold War tension,  of Berlin blockade and airlift, that will assure the general as permanent a  place in history as any man gets.  </P> <P> Not for nothing did the citizens of Berlin place at the foot of Clay's grave at  West Point a tablet that read: Wir danken dem Bewahrer unserer Freiheit (We  thank the defender of our freedom).  </P> <P> A justly large part of Smith's story then is given over to the remaking of  Germany in a democratic image. And if Clay gets more credit as proconsul than  he might deserve, well, Smith would not be the first biographer to enhance his  subject's image.  </P> <P> Some of that burnishing strains the record, however. Clay triumphs, in Smith's  account, because everyone else -- the State Department, George C. Marshall,  Dean Acheson, George Kennan, among others -- is flawed, or weak, or conniving.  </P> <P> Similarly, Smith maintains that Clay "was not a militant cold warrior" but a  keen student of geopolitics who believed that "the celebrated architects of  Cold War containment were purchasing Allied unity at Germany's expense."  (Indeed, Clay fixed a great deal of the blame for the failure of four-power  government in Germany on the condemnatory French, not the war-weary Soviets.)  </P> <P> Be that as it may, it was this same general who on March 5, 1948, sent a  calculated, back-channels cable to Washington warning that war "may come with  dramatic suddenness." The Clay cable triggered real alarm in the Truman  Administration, and impelled a series of rearmament measures.  </P> <P> Yet Clay did not believe a word of his telegram; he made the assertion merely  to goose a congressional committee into approving a budget bill the Army  favored. It was not the last time a self-serving military officer exceeded his  authority, then pleaded innocence.  </P> <P> Nor would this be the last time Clay influenced world affairs. Indeed, one  might have wished Smith had devoted more attention to the later, political  Clay. By then president of Continental Can Corp., Clay played a pivotal role in  making his friend Dwight David Eisenhower the 34th President of the United  States.  </P> <P> Clay, Tom Dewey and Herbert Brownell shaped Eisenhower's pre-convention  strategy and candidacy. Again, Smith may give too much credit to the  politically adept Clay -- at Ike's expense -- but he lays open Clay's largely  hidden role.  </P> <P> Clay the soldier, the diplomat, the politician, are all here in Smith's  sometimes cumbersome biography, a book flawed, like its subject, but a  worthwhile addition to the record of our times.  </P> <P> Next: Jonathan Kirsch reviews "The Other California: The Great Central Valley  in Life and Letters" by Gerald W. Haslam (Capra Press).  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by President Fidel Castro with </F> domestic journalists at the conclusion of the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia; date not  given; from the "Evening Information Review" newscast --  passages within quotation marks recorded]    [Text] After completing his activities in Colombia, where  he attended the Fourth Ibero-American Summit of Heads of State  and Government, Cuban President Fidel Castro granted a news  conference to Cuban journalists who covered this important  meeting. In his first reply, Fidel said he does not believe  there were substantial differences between the summit in  Cartagena de Indias and the previous ones held in Guadalajara,  Madrid, and Salvador de Bahia.    [Castro] "I believe that there have been (?advances) in all  of them, and that altogether, they are positive. They have  improved. One is never satisfied with everything discussed at  the summit, or everything that is said. The mere fact that the  summits are held constitutes an important historical step in  Latin America. As I was explaining today to solidarity groups,  it is the first time in history that [words indistinct]. There  have been several summits, this was the fourth. These meetings  have been consolidated and have been institutionalized. These  Latin American summits have been institutionalized. Each one  has [words indistinct] and each one ends with specific  agreements, has promoted specific actions, but they have a  general [word indistinct]. I believe that a [words indistinct]  among Latin American leaders has been created, with greater  understanding, a greater spirit of cooperation reflected in the  various activities of Latin American countries in favor of  [words indistinct].    ``We should not analyze the summits only by what they  achieve, but for what they promote. They have helped promote  things. In my opinion, these summits are so important that they  have triggered the Miami Summit. Our northern neighbors got  worried [words indistinct] specific results in subregional  integration organizations. Therefore, they decided to call a  summit; we still do not know if it will be an annual summit. Of  course, you know what the exclusions are [words indistinct] they  know that even though the summit is in Miami, I would go [words  indistinct] I believe this is a cowardly exclusion, which  reflects the [words indistinct] because it is an opportunity, we  cannot deny it, of creating a Latin America [words indistinct]  the presumed owners of this hemisphere. I hope there will be  enough enthusiasm -- and there is always [word indistinct] and  enough courage -- and there are always courageous men -- to  mention some truths in that summit. I hope that the interests of  Latin America and the Caribbean, which are many, are defended.''    Fidel Castro also pointed out that having given intensity  to social development issues is one of the modest contributions  Cuba made to the Ibero-American summits.    [Castro] "[Word indistinct] we have made a strong effort to  raise the summits' spirits and to give meaning to them. I  believe the Cuban delegation has no reason to be (?ashamed) of  these statements, and [words indistinct], especially at this  summit because we are looking at the so-called Miami Summit. We  already started discussing the Miami Summit. We believe these  summits have created awareness. Integration awareness is one  such issue created by these summits. We should measure the  success of the summits by the number of tangible issues, not by  the awareness they have created, the rapprochement they have  generated, or the contacts achieved by the Latin American  rulers. [Words indistinct] of the Cuban contribution; Cuba has  made a modest contribution. You were asking about the summits'  contribution to Cuba. I can tell you they have contributed to  fighting Cuban isolation, to creating awareness of the blockade,  to giving a lesson to the United States, and to [words  indistinct] Cuba's expulsion. Cuba recently improved its  relations with the rest of Latin America; Cuba has encountered a  more propitious climate for economic relations and trade."    As for the Miami hemispheric summit, the Cuban president was  asked what issues the Latin America should stress there.    [Castro] "We must promote the defense of sovereignty and the  principle of nonintervention in Latin America. In addition,  those pretexts used to intervene in Latin America's domestic  affairs, such as drug trafficking, must no longer be used to  violate the Latin American countries' sovereignties. We must  change armies into police bodies. In other words, there is a  number of economic and political issues that should be stressed  at the Miami summit. I was thinking that if the United States  indeed wants to have more mature relations and if it wants to  close its military bases in Latin America, it should not forget  the Guantanamo base; the United States should comply with the  agreements signed to remove all military bases in Panama and in  any other country. There are security, political, and economic  problems that must be discussed at this summit. I would say  there is a world to be discussed there.    ``I urge the Latin American countries to discuss these  issues  at the so-called Miami Summit. I know very brave Latin American  and Caribbean politicians. I met them at these Ibero-American  summits; they are valuable and capable people. I hope they will  bring these issues up at the Miami Summit. The slogans that  were uttered from decade to decade and from century to century  were just lies and more lies.''    To this effect, the top Cuban leader pointed out the United  States continues to be the biggest obstacle to Latin American  integration.    [Castro] "The United States wants to disintegrate us,  because  it opposes true Latin American integration. It wants the  countries to move forward on their own. [Words indistinct]  toward integration, the United States is promoting bilateral  integration among the many Latin American countries. The same  thing that happened with the foreign debt, when it opposed  holding negotiations with an integrated Latin America, is  happening now. The United States refuses to let Latin America  integrate; it wants to sign agreements with individual countries  to meet its own interests, thus preventing a true American union  from forming. One thing, however, is what the United States  wants, and another is what Latin Americans are doing on their  own: promoting their own bilateral agreements.    ``Mexico is promoting bilateral free trade agreements with  different countries. It already did that with Chile. Although  Mexico is a NAFTA member, Mexico also just signed a free trade  agreement with Venezuela and Colombia, the Group of Three. They  say the ideas of free trade and Latin American integration are  slowly making headway.''    Cuban reporters were not an exception and also asked Castro  about the guayabera shirt he wore in Cartagena, generating such  great surprise and suspicion.    [Castro] "The tale of the guayabera has been quite a tale.  [Words indistinct] some people disagreed, I mean some of the  security people. (?A girl) asked why I took off my uniform.  No, I continue to wear my uniform deep inside, [words  indistinct] but I am already used to those boots [words  indistinct] the first day I wore the slacks [words indistinct]  and yesterday I also (?wore it) so she could tell me I was  wearing the uniform [words indistinct], and that I was wearing a  guayabera and slacks as uniform [words indistinct] navy blue  plants and a guayabera, but I kept the boots. I only took my  boots off to sleep. [laughter]"    [Reporter] "Commander."    [Castro] "[Passage indistinct] I did it heeding an  invitation  or the request made to everyone. I did not want to (?stand out)  [words indistinct]."    [Reporter] "[Question indistinct]"    [Castro] "[Words indistinct] [laughter] I wear my olive  green  uniform again.    [Reporter] "People in Cuba are [words indistinct]"    [Castro] "I can [words indistinct], tomorrow I would not  [words indistinct]."    [Reporter] "You are not going to have the final word.  [laughter]"    [Castro] "No, that does not mean I will never again wear it,  but (?I may wear it) to some reception [words indistinct] it is  comfortable. It is truly comfortable. I do not know if [words  indistinct] Robertico [Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina]  with a uniform [words indistinct] [laughter]"    [Reporter] "[Words indistinct]"    [Castro] "I felt comfortable because it is truly hot there  and [words indistinct] but I think I am going back to my olive  green uniform. It is an old habit."</p>

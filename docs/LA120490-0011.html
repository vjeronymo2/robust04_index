			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON MILITARY SERVICE;  </P> <P> DEVIL'S BARGAIN IN THE FRONT LINES;  </P> <P> WITHOUT A U.S. COMMITMENT TO EQUALITY, DISPROPORTIONATE BLACK DEATHS IN THE  GULF COULD TURN GRIEF INTO HATRED.  </P> <P> African-Americans are about 12% of the U.S. population, but they could become  25% of U.S. casualties in a massive ground conflict with Iraq. This is a bitter  prospect for those who believe that blacks did more than their fair share of  the dying in Vietnam.  </P> <P> Even though that belief is mistaken, it has had a powerful effect on public  attitudes and on military-personnel policy. It caused blacks, along with most  other Americans, to accept a devil's bargain, the all-volunteer force.  </P> <P> The belief that blacks bore the brunt of battle in Vietnam is not totally  baseless, however. In 1965 and 1966, blacks were more than 16% of all combat  deaths and more than 20% of the Army's fatalities.  </P> <P> These figures prompted Martin Luther King Jr. to complain that "we were taking  the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them . . .  to guarantee liberties in southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest  Georgia."  </P> <P> King's complaint profoundly affected the body politic, even though many  leaders, including some prominent civil-rights activists, rebuked him for it.  </P> <P> In an effort to correct inequities, the Selective Service System eliminated  most draft deferments and began conscripting white, middle-class college  students. This evened out the combat burden so that blacks were roughly 12% of  U.S. fatalities in Vietnam; but it also turned college campuses into hotbeds of  anti-war protest.  </P> <P> The all-volunteer force emerged from an unholy alliance of doves and hawks; the  former opposed the Vietnam War and thus compulsory service, while the latter  supported the war but avoided battle. Because the all-volunteer force did not  come into being until 1973, it has not been tested in a major conflict.  </P> <P> For the past decade, African-Americans have constituted around 20% of the 2  million-plus people on active duty. Their representation varies greatly across  ranks, services and military occupational specialties. As of mid-1990, blacks  made up almost 23% of active-duty enlisted personnel but less than 7% of  commissioned officers.  </P> <P> Partly because of the Vietnam experience, each service now tends to distribute  combat training roughly in proportion to its own racial composition.  </P> <P> The Defense Department has not provided detailed information about the makeup  of units in the Persian Gulf. With more than 200,000 U.S. troops already in  place and an additional 200,000 scheduled for deployment, however, the force  probably represents a good cross-section of the total active force.  </P> <P> Statements about battle tactics and body counts are necessarily conjectural. In  the best-case scenario, Iraq's occupation of Kuwait will be resolved without a  shot being fired at U.S. forces. In the worst case, the United States and its  U.N. allies will become involved in a large-scale ground conflict that lasts  for months and produces thousands of casualties. In the latter scenario, about  one out of every four U.S. casualties is likely to be black, and about one out  of every three is likely to be Latino, black, Asian-American or American  Indian.  </P> <P> Little can be done to alter the composition of the military, at least not  quickly. Returning to conscription, as some have proposed, would have virtually  no effect. Draft calls are used to make up for a shortage of volunteers, and in  recent years the services have seldom run short of volunteers. Under current  economic conditions, the only sure way to reduce black representation is to  impose racial quotas.  </P> <P> During the past 15 peacetime years, the all-volunteer force provides benefits  all around: middle-class youth kept their careers from being sidetracked by  military service; the poor of all races found opportunities not available in  civilian society; women proved their mettle in a previously all-male domain;  the armed forces got good personnel, and political leaders were let off the  hook, not forced to deal with this nation's enormous social inequities.  </P> <P> If we go to war, however, those benefits will turn into heavy burdens; blacks  will die in large numbers, legions of Al Sharptons will contrive to turn the  private grief of their families into public hatred, and the country will suffer  another season of discontent.  </P> <P> We can alter the terms of our devil's bargain by committing ourselves, as a  nation, to improving education and employment opportunities for all Americans.  This is a long-term task, however, requiring greater moral and political  fortitude than this country's leaders have shown in recent years.  </P> <P> In the meantime, we must deal with the instant case. Those of us who worry  about a disproportionate combat burden are obliged to exercise special care.  Expressions of concern must not undermine the morale of our soldiers or give  false hope to an adversary. No returning black soldier should be made to feel  that he was a "chump" for having served.  </P> <P> Furthermore, the prospect of a disproportionate combat burden, however  worrisome, is not sufficient reason to reject what the Bush Administration is  attempting in the Persian Gulf. As a matter of principle, a policy should not  be judged solely by the degree to which blacks are involved in its  execution.Edwin DornROSLIN ARINGTON  </P></p>

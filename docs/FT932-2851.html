			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / PSBR jumps to Pounds 9.7bn for first two months PUBLIC FINANCES moved further into the red last month as the public sector borrowing requirement grew to Pounds 5.01bn from Pounds 4.71bn in April and Pounds 3.13bn in May last year. Official figures released yesterday showed that the PSBR or budget deficit increased to Pounds 9.7bn in the first two months of the current financial year, from Pounds 6.6bn in the same period last year. The rise reflected continued strong growth in government spending and sluggish increases in tax revenues. Government cash receipts rose only 2 per cent to Pounds 32.8bn in April and May from Pounds 32.1bn in the same two months last year. Total cash outlays of Pounds 41.4bn in the two months were 8.5 per cent higher than the Pounds 38.2bn disbursed in the same period last year. The cumulative PSBR so far this year is nearly one-fifth of the Pounds 50bn deficit that the government forecast for the 1993-94 financial year in its March Budget. Mr Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers International in London, said government spending should slow during the rest of the year while revenues should pick up. However, he warned that trends needed to improve for the government to avoid overshooting its deficit forecast. The May PSBR was slightly below market expectations in spite of a fall in value added tax receipts. The drop reflected a shift in companies' accounting for VAT to a monthly from a quarterly basis.</p>

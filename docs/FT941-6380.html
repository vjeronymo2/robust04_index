			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Rule change urged for ITV groups: Ownership regime 'restrictive' The Independent Television Commission has come out in favour of a fundamental reform of commercial television ownership rules to ease restrictions on takeovers and allow newspapers to have larger stakes in broadcasters. In its submission to Mr Peter Brooke, the national heritage secretary who is reviewing cross-media ownership regulations, the ITC says the present rules are too restrictive. In particular, the quality of ITV service could suffer unless something is done about the disparity between large and small ITV groups. The commission believes that the main terrestrial channels will continue to dominate UK viewing into the next century. But as the number of cable and satellite channels grows there is less justification for restrictions on changes in ownership 'designed originally to cater for broadcasting services in fixed overall supply'. The best way to protect diversity of information sources while allowing small regional ITV companies to be part of larger groups is to set a market-share limit for ITV ownership rather than restricting ownership to the present maximum two licences. The ITC believes the ceiling should be set at 25 per cent of television advertising revenue with no limit on licences. The commission thinks newspaper groups should be able to take stakes in broadcasters, short of control. This is defined as 30 per cent, compared with the present 20 per cent. The ITC concludes this would be 'an appropriate first step, to be reviewed for its effectiveness'. ITV companies should be able to take stakes of up to 30 per cent in the planned Channel 5 instead of 20 per cent. The commission also attacks the government stipulation that the ITV companies should hold less than 50 per cent of Independent Television News by the end of this year. This 'lacks solid justification' and there is no leading network in other parts of the world which is not able to control the main source of its national and international news. The ITC suggests that as satellite viewing increases there could come a point when the cross-media restrictions which apply to terrestrial services should also be applied to satellite services. British Sky Broadcasting, in which Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation has a 50 per cent stake and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, is a significant shareholder, is not subject to cross-media rules. The possibility of undesirable dominance occurring through 'agenda setting' means that restrictions on ownership should continue. The ITC believes the government should define in terms of ownership or revenue share when ownership restrictions should apply to the new cable and satellite services.</p>

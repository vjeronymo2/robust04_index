			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Brazil's Telesp tumbles into the red after price freeze TELESP, the public telephone company serving Brazil's largest state, Sao Paulo, suffered losses of Dollars 12.9m (Cr13.7bn) for 1991, compared with profits of Dollars 107.3m the year before. Telesp was among the most sought after companies in the Brazilian stock market in 1991. Its ordinary stock increased in value by 12,419 per cent and preferential stock by 11,046 per cent during the year. One reason for Telesp's negative showing in 1991 was the price freeze imposed by the federal government during most of the first semester, said Mr Pedro Vilani, senior investment analyst for Norchem Bank, a Sao Paulo bank. 'After August, there were steep price increases, and by the end of the year, prices had caught up with inflation,' Mr Vilani observed. Another reason for Telesp's losses was the effect of a law requiring companies to revalue assets to incorporate real inflation rates, which were higher than original government figures. 'Law 8200 was a new factor from the point of view of investors,' noted Mr Vilani. The Norchem analyst expects Telesp to bounce back in 1992. In addition to price increases, he noted that positive signs included the company's expansion plan and its solid financial structure. 'We are expecting better results in 1992,' he predicted. Usiminas, the recently privatised steel producer, announced that it overcame the effects of Law 8200 to make profits of Dollars 69m (Cr74bn). The company said the inflation accounting changes required by 8200 cut profits by more than half, forcing a downward adjustment of Dollars 82m. Usiminas was the first company sold, in October, under President Fernando Collor de Mello's privatisation programme. In 1990, it earned Dollars 11.3m. The company is studying restructuring plans and hopes to buy into some of the state-owned firms scheduled to go on the block, includ-ing Acesita, Acominas and CST.</p>

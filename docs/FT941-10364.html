			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Bonn boosts part-time work: Government bodies are ordered to change the way they hire staff The German government has ordered government ministries and federal agencies to offer all their vacancies in future to part-time as well as full-time workers, as part of a programme to promote part-time employment. The move was agreed by the cabinet in Bonn yesterday, following publication of Monday's grim unemployment figures, which topped 4m for the first time in the history of the federal republic. Ms Angela Merkel, minister for youth and women's affairs, said federal agencies had been told to report back on their progress in encouraging part-time workers, who must be offered the same career prospects as full-time civil servants. The government maintains that 2.5m workers, mainly women, would like to work in part-time jobs. However, currently only 17 per cent of jobs in Germany are worked part-time, compared with 34 per cent in the Netherlands. Ms Merkel said that a recent study indicated that at least 1.5m jobs could be created by work sharing, and that 30 per cent of workers were ready to work less and earn less. The latest moves are part of the government's programme of deregulation and privatisation measures, which amount to the main element in its job-creation strategy. Yesterday, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, economics minister, again urged an acceleration in deregulation and privatisation, measures, he said, which had enjoyed widespread support at a conference in Bonn on the problem of Germany's lack of international competitiveness. He called for privatisation of the savings bank network - a move fiercely resisted by the banks themselves - as well as the break-up of the monopoly control of the gas and electricity grids. The cabinet yesterday approved a new motorway tax for road haulage operators, who will have to pay up to DM2,500 (Pounds 954) a year for heavy trucks. Mr Matthias Wissman, the transport minister, said it was possible a similar tax would be introduced for passenger cars, but not before the end of the year. Germany wants such a measure to be introduced throughout the European Union.</p>

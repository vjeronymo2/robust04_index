			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Food and Drink: Taste of Russian riches - Grand hotels . . . but only if you are a foreigner OPEN ANOTHER luxury hotel in London and no one notices. Do it in an impoverished, developing country, trying to recover from 70 years of communism, and you experience contrasts otherwise restricted to avant-garde films. Since the Grand Hotel Europe reopened last Christmas, St Petersburg has provided the only true five-star hotel in Russia amid contrasts obvious even to the short-sighted. 'Dom Perignon?' 'Of course, Madame.' 'Claret?' 'Yes, sir. Might I recommend the Haut Brion '79?'. The price, Dollars 179, (Pounds 101.10) a mere four years' salary for an average Leningrader. Beggars, including children, stand or sit in the snow outside. A cheeky boy hops round on his one leg. Does he really need the money, I ask the top-hatted doorman? He begins a prepared speech about the 'inadequacies of our former social system,' thinks better of it, and replies simply 'yes'. Perhaps the same contrasts were evident in 1824 when the hotel first opened and Russia already had an emerging middle class, although an absolute gulf separated serfs from aristocracy. Then, as now, it was the place to stay with regular visitors including Maxim Gorki, Nikolai Gogol and Anna Pavlova. And it was never cheap. By the 1980s the hotel - renamed the Evropeiskaya - was completely run down, operating on service-with-a-snarl lines. I lived there for several weeks, enjoying the central location just off Nevski Prospect, the architectural gems, especially the extraordinary brass and marble, art nouveau lavatories (now sadly gone) and enduring the food in silence. It closed in 1989 with reconstruction entrusted to Swedish companies SIAB and hotel group Reso AB, the current operator, which own 30.5 per cent. Intourist's majority share has now passed to the city. I may not be the best person to write about large hotels as I wilt under their impersonality. The Europe is truly different. Internally, at least, many rooms and guest suites go beyond good taste in achieving a harmony approaching artistic beauty. Many old features have been retained, including the wonderful, galleried dining room and the first floor salon, though the grand piano has gone. Sven Vermelin, the urbane hotel manager, says: 'We are trying to get it back but we are competing with a museum.' Modern features include a wonderfully spacious 'open-air' cafe/business centre (there is a distant, glass roof) where the jangled nerves of afternoon guests are soothed by a superb harpist from the nearby conservatoire. Capitalist brooms doubtless anticipated problems in sweeping out socialist stables, but the transition has been remarkably smooth. Vermelin says: 'We made a profit from day one. Ninety per cent of our guests are business people, mainly from France, Germany and the US. Food? We have a container from Sweden every week and higher returns than expected on food and beverage operations. Room rates start at Dollars 110 and go up to Dollars 500 for suites'. And, although he was too polite to say so, those suites are really something. Western businesses wanting to operate in St Petersburg have experienced major differences in finding office space. The Swedish consul Dag Ellander says: 'First there are legal uncertainties over owning property. And secondly people here do not understand market realities. St Petersburg is not Tokyo or downtown New York.' So, many western organisations set up house in the Grand Hotel Europe, where attractions include reliable international communications facilities. They include Proctor and Gamble, the Danish Consulate and Dresdener Bank. One of my favourite places is the Brasserie. Where else outside a university can you eat with so many graduates (all the waitresses?) such as the beautiful Maria, who has fluent Italian, good English (yes, I know, I am smitten) and a degree in film making, or economist Alesa: 'It must sound funny. I graduated in economics from St Petersburg University and now I am learning to be a waitress in a capitalist production . . . Though I enjoy the work. Really] It is totally new for me.' Food is good, too, although with a Swedish bias. Breast of chicken in pepper sauce, should be fiery, not served, Swedish-style in up-market ketchup. And if you can find any Russian currency, the place to meet locals - especially neighbourhood mafia yuppies - is the Sadko rouble bar, where there is a simple, appetising menu and a glass of Swedish beer or a bottle of Russian sparkling wine cost the same, R200 (Pounds 1.12). Nothing beats seeing how your food is prepared so I wandered into the gleaming, stainless steel kitchens to chat with Welshman John Evans, chief pastry cook and former sous-chef at London's Connaught. Hard at work on gateaux opera and raspberry royales, Evans told me the hotel was just like home for quality, with only staff training carried out at a noticeably inferior level. But he admitted to other problems: 'Like people nicking all my cooking chocolate.' For a final verdict, I turned to American Lynnley Browning, who works in the Europe for a resident US company. She told me: 'This hotel is not only first rate by Russian standards, it is first rate by world standards. There is nowhere else like it in St Petersburg.' Meanwhile, flushed with success, Reso is setting its sights on the capital. Watch out Moscow, real food could ruin your tastebuds for ever. I marched into the street and the grim reality of contemporary St Petersburg. Only a fraction of a per cent of the city's inhabitants have ever been inside the Europe. The Dollars 64,000 economic question is: how many of them ever will?</p>

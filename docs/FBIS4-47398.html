Pavlov, Murmansk  Marine Biology Institute, Kola Scientific Center, Russian  Academy of Sciences; UDC 574.4:504.05(268.45)    [Abstract] Radionuclide monitoring studies conducted in  1991 and 1992 on Barents Sea and adjacent shoreline showed that  Cs-137 levels ranged from essentially zero to 1440 Bq/kg of  benthic sample collected from different locations. Measurements  on mossess and lichens from adjacent shores revealed levels of  contamination with Cs-137 approaching 530 Bq/g at some  locations. These findings indicate that the Barents Sea region  has sustained an increase in the level of radionuclide  contamination over the past four decades. The contaminating  radionuclides derived from nuclear weapons testing in the  fifties and sixties, activities of Western radiochemical plants,  as well as the the Chernobyl accident.

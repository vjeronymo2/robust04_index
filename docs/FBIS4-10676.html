			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Guadalajara, (Mexico), 13 Apr (EFE) -- The 35th  Inter-American Development Bank [IDB] Annual Assembly ended  today in Guadalajara with specific agreements among the member  states to increase the bank's capital, redefine its  organization, and place stronger emphasis on fighting poverty.    The governors expressed their satisfaction with the  agreements reached at the meeting. Much of the interest in the  meeting was lost hours before it even began on Monday because  the member countries had already agreed to increase the bank's  capital and to focus more attention on social issues.    In addition to deciding on a $40-billion increase over the  next six years, bringing the IDB's capital to $100 billion, the  countries of the region decided to relinquish part of their  voting rights to Japan and the European banks in return for  greater contributions from them. The non-American members will  now have an additional representative on the IDB Executive  Board, which will be headed by Japan, while the Latin American  members gained an additional seat to compensate for the vote  that they relinquished.    When the meeting concluded, Pedro Aspe, Mexican Finance and  Public Credit secretary and president of the 35th IDB Annual  Assembly, said this agreement allows the Latin American  countries to retain a majority with 50 percent of the votes and  that no more votes will be relinquished to nonregional members  in exchange for their contributions. Aspe stressed the  multilateral nature of this decision, saying that it gives  nonregional countries 16 percent of the votes. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Arts: Pop memorabilia comes of age - Saleroom Every year somebody discovers a 'lost' Raphael, or a previously unknown El Greco, and the fine art world goes gooey-eyed. Next month Sotheby's sells the pop world's equivalent, a recording of John Lennon fronting his first band, the Quarrymen, in a church hall on a wet night in Liverpool in 1957. Sixteen-year-old Bob Molyneux, a recording fanatic, taped an instantly recognisable Lennon screeching out two songs, one of them the hit of the day, Lonnie Donnegan's 'Puttin' on the style'. By chance he never got round to taping over the event, and as Lennon, as a Beatle, quickly became famous, Molyneux realised he had a potential gem and stored the recording in a bank vault. It should make him up to Pounds 150,000 richer on September 15. Pop memorabilia, for long a disparaged sector of the auction market, is coming of age. The first sale was held by Sotheby's in 1981 and raised Pounds 50,000. Next month's auction should comfortably top Pounds 1m. Prices have hiccuped on occasion, especially when the Japanese temporarily abandoned the market, but in the main they have avoided the convulsions which have hit more outwardly respectable sectors, like Impressionist art and classic cars. In a generation's time the auction houses will still be selling the history of pop music, almost certainly for prices that today would look extravagant. It could be regarded as very depressing, suggesting that the new rich, the successful entrepreneurs in their 30s and 40s, are so culturally deprived that they would rather spend their superfluous wealth on the paraphernalia of their youth rather than on the intellectual challenge of becoming connoisseurs of paintings or porcelain. There is very little artistic merit in the bulk of the items appearing for sale at Bonhams next Thursday and at Christie's on September 8, as well as at Sotheby's. But pop music is certainly the great cultural, and social, phenomenon of the second half of the 20th century and mementos of icons, be they saints or military commanders, have always been collected. Like pop itself there is also a commercial element behind much of the buying. Restaurants, especially the various Hard Rock Cafes, often walk away with a quarter of the sales for use in decorating their outlets. Rock museums are also keen buyers. And the bidders for the Quarrymen tape will surely seek the agreement of the original song writers to exploit the recording commercially. Lennon could sing again from the grave. The Beatles, naturally, dominate the auctions. The Japanese buy nothing but Beatles. Most of the buyers at the sales are fans - as are the sellers. The attraction of pop memorabilia is that it reaches down to street level. There must be thousands of middle-aged women with a signed photograph of the Beatles. A good example might sell for up to Pounds 600. And there will be even more thousands with forged Beatles signatures - their Fan Club often did the job for the Fab Four. Fakes - of gold discs, guitars, and costumes as well as signatures - are a real problem in this business. The auction houses spend hours trying to authenticate material and around half the items offered for sale are declined because of doubts about their provenance. Apart from the Quarrymen tape the Sotheby's auction has a wide spread of the most desirable pop memorabilia, making it the best sale for years. Among the most desirable objects of the sector are autograph original lyrics of Beatles songs. Sotheby's made Pounds 45,800 from 'I am the walrus' last year: it hopes for Pounds 30,000 from 'You've got to hide your love away' next month. Some of the most celebrated lyrics have yet to surface ('Yesterday', for example, would easily top Pounds 100,000): they remain the sought after 'sleepers' of the pop world. Along with lyrics well used instruments also arouse great interest. Last year a Jimi Hendrix Fender guitar went for Pounds 198,000, to the Jimi Hendrix Museum in Seattle. Sotheby's is selling two more Hendrix guitars (estimated up to Pounds 60,000) while Bonhams, a new force in this market, is offering the finest Hendrix archive ever to surface, with a 'Gibson Flying V' guitar (modestly estimated at up to Pounds 25,000) as well as some really glamorous clothes, redolent with 1960s chic. Hendrix is keenly collected. An early death helped, contracting his career into less than four years, thus ensuring that his paraphernalia is as rare as it is exotic. There are curious discrepancies between a pop star's reputation in the real world and in the saleroom. The Rolling Stones have never punched their commercial weight at the rostrum (a good signed Stone's autographed photograph might make Pounds 300), perhaps because ex-Stone Bill Wyman is known to have accumulated an unmatchable archive of the band. Bob Dylan, too, one of the undoubted giants of the genre, arouses little excitement, although Sotheby's hopes for Pounds 6,000 for one of his early harmonicas. (There must be hundreds out there somewhere, but authenticating that Dylan actually blew them can be tricky). In contrast Freddie Mercury (dead), Marc Bolan (dead) and the Sex Pistols (a quarter dead) are auction room favourites. A Mercury postcard ('My dearest cherry trifle') commands a Pounds 600 top estimate; a Bolan bolero jacket Pounds 2,500; and Johnny Rotten's lyrics for the Pistol's 'New York', around the same sum. Of course the most famous dead rocker is Elvis. One of the many Elvis museums in the US recently sold off its stock at the Los Angeles saleroom of Butterfield &amp; Butterfield and ended up Dollars 3.36m richer, with a cream coloured stage suit racing beyond its Dollars 30,000 estimate to Dollars 101,500. While London is the heart of the international market in pop memorabilia good Presley material sells best in the US. After all he managed to avoid the UK in his lifetime, too. As pop music loses its creative spark it is in danger of becoming a museum culture. This would be bad news for the auction houses, reduced to recycling ever more antique material. Fortunately a few contemporary artists catch the collectors' imagination. Michael Jackson seems to have recovered his appeal after a bad spell last year; Prince is collected; and, of course, Madonna. Yet another of the Gaultier designed basques she wore in her Blonde Ambition tour comes up at Sotheby's commanding a Pounds 12,000 estimate. Over time pop memorabilia could well merge into the general entertainment auctions, devoted mainly to Hollywood. Christie's South Kensington is putting a Barbra Streisand archive into its September 8 auction (with up to Pounds 4,000 expected for a costume from The Way We Were). The main experiment at Christie's is the inclusion of the first significant collection devoted to a jazz giant, Charlie Parker. It belongs to his last partner, Mrs Chan Parker, and includes music manuscripts, awards and letters. It should bring in more than Pounds 100,000. If it goes well, jazz musicians could come into their own commercially in the auction rooms.</p>

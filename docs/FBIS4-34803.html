			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas G.] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino announced  yesterday Panama will establish special flights for Haitians who  are in Panamanian territory when the blockade on commercial  flights to that Caribbean island goes into effect.    Mulino said that before that date, "Haitians who are in the  country may be returned to their country."    The foreign minister added that if Haitian citizens cannot  get seats on "scheduled Copa flights to Haiti for any reason,  the Panamanian authorities will authorize the airline to make  two flights so that all of the Haitians may return home.

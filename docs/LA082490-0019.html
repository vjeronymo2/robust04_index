			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLEWATCH  </P> <P> Back to Court: Attorneys for Rodney Dangerfield want to bat allegations that  the comedian was a chronic drug and alcohol abuser in his civil suit against  Caesars Palace. In motions filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas,  the attorneys said the allegations were untrue and without foundation.  </P> <P> Dangerfield's case against Caesars Palace, which was scheduled to go to trial  Monday, has been postponed until Sept. 10. Caesars Palace attorneys filed court  papers earlier this week claiming Dangerfield smokes marijuana, drinks vodka  heavily and uses cocaine. The claims by the resort were made to show that  Dangerfield was responsible for canceling a series of shows at Caesars.  Dangerfield had sued Caesars for $225,000 in disputed contract money and  medical and legal bills. BETH KLEID  </P></p>

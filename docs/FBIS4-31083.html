			<p>BFN     [Text] Pristina, June 3 (TANJUG) -- Vice-premier of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) Nikola Sainovic said on  Friday that the F.R.Y. basic policy of peace, security and  economic revival was being administered despite hardships,  sanctions and war encirclement. In a talk with managers of the  biggest enterprises in Pristina, centre of the southern Serbian  province of Kosovo and Metohija, Sainovic emphasized that the  Yugoslav economic program differed from those in other countries  which have similar economic problems because it enables strong  resistance to sanctions and economic pressures and essentially  defends the country's economic independence.    Basically, said Sainovic, this model program means reliance  upon one's own potential, and this holds good for the country as  a whole and for the level of enterprises. The exit from the  crisis, said he, is the same for the big business systems as  well as small-sized enterprises. The two-year-old U.N.-imposed  sanctions on Yugoslavia cannot be an excuse for any one within  the economy any longer, because adequate solutions to such  problems should have been found in the meantime, said Sainovic.    The program of reinvigoration of the Yugoslav economy,  enforced early January, relies upon a restrictive monetary  policy, a reform of the taxation system, amd the elimination of  huge budgetary deficits. Sainovic said it was necessary to  change an old habit of giving "special discounts" to the less  developed regions and to certain public enterprises.    There are no such discounts any longer, but what has to be  done is to work together and to jointly seek solutions to the  problems, through assistance extended by other enterprises, said  Sainovic in stressing that his present talks in Pristina  entirely differed from the way talks were held in the past when  this province had only been demanding aid from the federal  budget.    Kosovo and Metohija, a region with abundant natural  resources, in the former Yugoslavia had been heavily subsidised  (as the least developed region with the highest unemployment  rate) from the special fund for the country's less developed  regions.</p>

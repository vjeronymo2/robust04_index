			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / People: Steeped in the drinks trade MATTHEW CLARK, the drinks producer and distributor that has been seeking to enter the cider market, has named Michael Cottrell, non-executive chairman of Taunton Cider, to the same position on its board. He succeeds Francis Gordon Clark, 57, who has retired after 17 years as chairman. Keen to penetrate the growth cider sector, the company was disappointed last year to lose out to a management buy-out when Allied Lyons was disposing of cider and Babycham maker Showerings. But the recently floated Taunton is hardly now a target of the smaller Matthew Clark. Cottrell, 53, has been on the latter's board since May 1991. Born in Gibraltar, he entered the trade via the family business, wine and spirits specialist Saccone &amp; Speed. S &amp; S, which started on the Rock, was purchased by Courage back in 1962; he stayed at Courage, rising to managing director between 1982-1987, but leaving six months after the acquisition by Australian brewing group Elders. ' I suppose I had become rather possessive about Courage' he remarks. He then spent eighteen months at Lord Delfont's First Leisure - a Courage client - latterly as chairman and chief executive, but 'there were really too many people at the top of the company' and he did not feel 'stretched'. He tried headhunters Russell Reynolds for two years - mostly working on clients within his beloved 'booze business' and now divides his time between a handful of non-executive positions in the drinks trade as well as looking after S &amp; S Gibraltar, part of the old family company, bought back, from GrandMet, in 1987. He knows Matthew Clark chief executive Peter Aikens from the Courage days - Aikens having been chairman of Courage Brewing.</p>

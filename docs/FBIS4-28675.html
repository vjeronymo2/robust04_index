			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["`Sanctions' Racket of Doomed Puppet Clique" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- The traitor Kim  Yong-sam in "a telephone dialogue" with U.S. President Bill  Clinton on June 10 cried that "sanctions against the North must  be promoted continuously" and, on the previous day, in "a  telephone dialogue" with Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata,  he said "U.N. sanctions against the North are inevitable," a  Seoul-based radio report said.    On June 11, puppet Unification Minister Yi Hong-ku and  puppet  Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu met U.S. State Undersecretary  Tarnoff in Seoul and prattled that U.N. Security Council's  sanctions against the North are inevitable".    This tongue-wagging of the South Korean puppet clique is a  never-to-be condoned criminal act to leave fellow countrymen  victims of outside forces by realizing "sanctions against North"  through the United Nations" by all means by entreating the U.S.  and Japanese masters.    We solemnly warned the Kim Yong-sam group that "sanctions"  against our Republic is immediately a war and a war is merciless.    This notwithstanding, the Kim Yong-sam traitor clique are  making desperate efforts to get "sanctions" taken against the  North with the help of foreign forces. This is a dangerous  criminal act which may bring an unpredictable grave situation to  the Korean peninsula.    The outcries of the Kim Yong-sam group over "sanctions" will  precipitate their own destruction.    The South Korean puppet clique must act with discretion,  clearly mindful of the tragic end.</p>

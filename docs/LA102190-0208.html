			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILD STURDY PLANTER BOXES FROM PLANS  </P> <P> If you've shopped around recently for planters, you've discovered that their  prices are high (and construction often flimsy). Save money and build sturdy  pieces of plant furniture yourself.  </P> <P> They are easily constructed by following our detailed instructions with photos  and drawings. The materials lists are broken down individually so you'll know  what to purchase for each planter.  </P> <P> The geometric shapes pictured here can all be made from durable redwood,  redwood lathing, white or Southern pine to go with any decor. All you need to  build these attractive items is a handsaw, coping saw, hammer, nails and glue.  </P> <P> To obtain Plant Furniture, Plan 579, send $5.50. Our Greenthumb Grab Bag  includes the 579 plan as well as eight other gardening aids, No. C43. Price is  $18, which include postage and handling.  </P> <P> The Patterns for Better Living catalogue picturing 700 woodworking and  handicraft projects is $3.95. Send check or money order to Steve Ellingson, c/o  Los Angeles Times, P.0. Box 2383, Van Nuys, Calif. 91409-2383.  </P></p>

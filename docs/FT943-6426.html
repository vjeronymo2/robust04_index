			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Pakistan loan fraud probes The Pakistani government said at the weekend it had ordered investigations into the activities of officials at the country's two large public sector banks, following allegations that they were involved in fraudulent dealings related to loans worth up to Rs1bn (Pounds 21.1m) made during the rule of former prime minister Mr Nawaz Sharif. Senator Mr Malik Qasim, chairman of the government's federal anti corruption committee (FACC) announced that Presidents of the Habib Bank  - Pakistan's largest bank - and the National Bank of Pakistan, had been told to suspend officials who violated the rules in sanctioning loans under the populist 'self-employment scheme'. The scheme, Mr Sharif's brain-child, was meant to provide unemployed youth with up to Rs100,000 to set up small businesses. But officials say that in many cases the loans did not reach those they were designed for. 'In many cases, the loans were sanctioned to employed people and to those who were already running established businesses,' said Mr Qasim. 'We want to know if this was a deliberate attempt to keep many people out, to favour near and dear ones, or only a case of a poorly managed plan,' said one official. Its not yet clear, if the investigation will set back plans for privatising large banks.</p>

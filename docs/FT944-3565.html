			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Banks' risk assessment under scrutiny The Bank of England has established a specialist supervisory team to assess individual banks' ability to monitor how much risk they take on in their securities business. The team, set up in August, will not be making formal assessment visits until January 1996, but it has been making 'prototype visits' to examine the extent to which banks monitor their own risks. A Bank official said: 'Our overall impression is that the standards of risk management are satisfactory but we need to look at them very carefully.' Banks with inadequate practices will not be allowed to carry on securities business until their risk-measurement and monitoring are improved. The unit will be looking at the models used by banks to measure how the value of their securities holdings change with other market movements such as interest rates. While bigger banks with strong information technology systems are likely to monitor risk closely, there is concern that some risk measurement systems are rudimentary. The Bank of England will not tell banks what model to use. Instead, it will evaluate whether the model is sufficient to measure the risks that the individual bank is likely to take on, and the rigour with which it adheres to that model. The creation of the new unit was prompted by the advent of the capital adequacy directive, an EU move to standardise the capital requirements which banking and securities institutions must hold in respect of the risks they take on. For the first time, UK banks will have to hold capital in respect of so-called 'market risks', the risks that the value of securities they hold will fall or rise sharply in line with interest rates. Until now the Bank of England has been concerned mostly with 'counterparty risk', the risk that a debtor will not repay on time, and with the risk inherent in foreign exchange positions. The securities and futures authority, which monitors the securities positions of securities and investment banks, has been evaluating its own members' risk models for some time. Where regulators feel those models are inadequate, the models will have to be changed.</p>

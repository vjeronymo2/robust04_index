			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Hawthorn Leslie in possible bid talks Hawthorn Leslie, the USM-quoted maker of electronic goods and toys, said yesterday that it was in talks which might lead to a bid being made for the company. Any offer would be at a discount to the current share price, it said. The company's shares closed down  3/4 p at 2 3/4 p. No offer would be made unless Hawthorn concluded a final settlement with the funders of CP Finance and Leasing, the group's leasing subsidiary. Hawthorn said that such an agreement, subject to contract, had been reached.</p>

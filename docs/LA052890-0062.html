			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MACHINE TOOL ORDERS JUMP ON FOREIGN BUY  </P> <P> Orders for machine tools, used to make most manufactured goods from sewing  machines to weaponry, rose 8.9% to $289.45 million in April from March levels  as recession fears abated, the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology said Monday.  </P> <P> April was the second-straight month that tool orders increased and reversed a  decline that began in September, 1989.  </P> <P> The April total represented a rise of 19.3% from year-ago levels.  </P> <P> But the increase was primarily because of a large foreign order placed with  Cross &amp; Trecker Corp., a large machine tools and accessories company based  in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.  </P> <P> In its monthly report, the trade association for the machine tool industry said  April tool shipments dropped 10.6% from a year ago to $258.20 million but were  up 3.5% from a year ago.  </P> <P> Foreign orders totaled $24.55 million in April, a 67.8% drop from the $76.30  million reported in March.  </P> <P> "The writing is on the wall; to stay competitive, U.S. manufacturers must  invest in the most modern equipment that they can afford," said Albert Moore,  president of the association.  </P> <P> Total orders for metal-forming tools rose 22.1% last month to $82.60 million  from March's $67.65 million total.  </P></p>

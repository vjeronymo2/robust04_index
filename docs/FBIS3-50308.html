Article 43 of the Czech Constitution allows for armed forces  to be sent onto territories outside the Czech Republic only with  the consent of both houses of parliament. Article 39 provides  for foreign troops to be stationed in the Czech Republic on  condition that an absolute majority of members of the Senate  agree.    Speaking on a television discussion program this evening,  Baudys stated that the Partnership for Peace plan has both a  political and military layer. States seeking to join needed to  fulfill certain criteria, he said, such as the transparency of  military budget and plans, democratic control over the armed  forces and their ability to take part in UN actions, be they  humanitarian or protective.    He said Partnership for Peace represented a phase in which  applicant countries should demonstrate their mental, military,  and above all political compatibility with NATO's existing  members.    Baudys estimated the cost of implementing the project this  year at only a few hundred million korunas. The plan envisaged  both joint operations and the dispatch of army specialists to  Brussels, he said.</p>

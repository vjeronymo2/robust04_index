			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Nadir free to run businesses in Turkey MR ASIL NADIR, former head of Polly Peck International, has not been made bankrupt in Turkey and so is legally free to own and run businesses in the country, it emerged yesterday. While a Pounds 378m writ brought against him in October 1991 by the administrators to Polly Peck drove him into bankruptcy in the UK, no similar action has been taken through the Turkish courts. His legal status may cause difficulties for administrators after he fled his bail conditions in the UK two weeks ago for northern Cyprus and declared his intention to reclaim parts of his business empire. Mr Neil Cooper, Mr Nadir's court-appointed trustee in bankruptcy, confirmed that he had not sought to file for bankruptcy in the Turkish courts, but said this would have little effect on attempts to recover and control assets. He said there was little chance that if the Turkish courts did not recognise English bankruptcy they would accept evidence from foreign creditors for bankruptcy under local law. Turkish lawyers say the fraud charges Mr Nadir faces in the UK may dissuade him from entering Turkey, where he could be apprehended by Interpol and face possible extradition. Turkish banking law states that no one who has suffered bankruptcy can found a bank, although again it is unclear whether this applies to bankruptcy outside Turkey. Polly Peck International's local companies, although owned by foreign parties, are subject to Turkish bankruptcy proceedings. Of the Turkish companies connected with Mr Nadir, only Noble Air, the airline owned by his sister Mrs Bilge Nevzat, has been declared insolvent by the Turkish courts. A number of Turkish creditors including Imar Bank, the Turkish bank owned by the Uzan family, failed in their pursuit of claims against Mr Nadir's personal assets. Mr Nadir's newspaper Gunes, together with his magazine titles, have already been pledged to the UK creditors. In addition, Iktisat Bank has won control over an island he owned. Lawyers say it has now be sold to the Uzan family. Of the PPI assets, the Antalya Sheraton has been sold to the Dogus group for an undisclosed sum, believed to be around Dollars 42m. MediaPrint, the print works in Istanbul, has been bought by the Uzan group for Dollars 9.5m. Polly Peck's shares in Pizza Gida, the local Pizza Hut franchise, have been taken over by Pepsi Cola for an undisclosed sum.</p>

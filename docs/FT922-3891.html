			<p>920609 FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pentagon lifts contracts ban on GE engines THE PENTAGON has lifted a ban on awarding new contracts to General Electric's aircraft engine division, just four days after it imposed the punishment over GE's involve-ment in an Israeli bribery scandal, writes our New York staff. The Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency said it had lifted the ban because of GE's rapid response to the government's con-cerns about the management of the engine division, including an agreement to more government oversight of the operations. According to a suit being prosecuted by the US Justice Department, officials in GE's aircraft engines division were involved in kickbacks to Gen Rami Dotan of the Israeli air force to help insure equipment sales to that country.</p>

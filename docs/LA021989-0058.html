			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: A WOLVERINE IS ATTACKING MY LEG: BY TIM CAHILL (VINTAGE /  RANDOM HOUSE: $8.95)  </P> <P> Why venture down dangerous Himalayan rapids or up 40-story-high underground  precipices? To stir up enough endorphins to foster a feeling of exhilaration,  Tim Cahill explains, and to escape inner demons. Cahill's demon was the serial  killer, which he studied for a book he wrote prior to taking some of the trips  described in these pages: "Looking inside the mind of a murderer was  terrifying. . . . In those bad, shaky times, when I realized that one more  morbid detail, one more sordid fact, would send me screaming around the bend, I  knew it was time to go out and risk my life for no very good reason." Unlike  many Gonzo travel adventures, though, these stories are not so obsessed with  walking on the "razored precipice separating rational behavior from irrational"  that they lose sensitivity to other people, animals and places.  </P> <P> While Cahill mitigates armchair reader envy through bad puns ("We have always  depended on the kindness of rangers") and bizarre quips ("In diving . . . you  get to go around wearing tight rubber suits, and nobody thinks you're weird:  this is our little secret"), a few of these adventures are better experienced  than read about. Several pieces, however, are as substantial as they are  absorbing. "Love and Death in Gorilla Country," for example, is an original,  insightful look at an old story -- Dian Fossey's work with gorillas in Rwanda.  Cahill is silly at times (he finds gorilla life to be "incredibly slow moving  and predictable . . . like 'Dallas' on downers"), but he describes the apes  vividly (they smell "skunky with a splash of vinegar") and he sensitively  portrays the political power struggles that doomed Fossey.  </P> <P> An impressive collection, exploring the way the beauty and the darkness of the  physical world is mirrored in the human psyche. Cahill seeks out stress,  quoting author Ralph Keyes, "to enjoy the subsequent tranquility . . . . Risk  is a part of therapy; you can put your life on the line in order to save your  soul."  </P></p>

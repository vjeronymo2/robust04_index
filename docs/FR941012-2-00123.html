The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent Trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8.

The Expert has rendered a report to applicants (and such report has been filed with the SEC as an exhibit to the application) that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations will be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Funds that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert shall be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the Commission pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act. The work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following request by the Funds which the Funds agree to make, will be available for inspection by the Commission staff upon the written request for these work papers by a senior member of the Division of Investment Management or of a Regional Office of the Commission, limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, any Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrator or associate and Assistant Administrator. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in SAS No. 70 of the AICPA, as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11.

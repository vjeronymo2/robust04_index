			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Turmoil casts shadow over oil deal THE political turmoil in Azerbaijan has made it unclear whether an important oil deal will go through in the next few weeks as hoped. The planned deal, still under negotiation, was due to be given a boost during a visit to London in the first week of July by Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the Azerbaijani president, who last week went into hiding. It involves eight foreign oil companies and is aimed at exploiting an estimated 4bn barrels of the ex-Soviet republic's oil reserves. But foreign oil company and government officials say it is unlikely that Mr Elchibey will proceed with the visit. Last Friday, Mr Elchibey flew without warning to his home village, and handed over temporary power to Mr Heydar Aliyev, the parliamentary chairman. The upheaval has caused many of the foreign oil officials to leave the country. Some of the remaining officials have voiced concern about the impact of the political struggle on their attempts to close deals with the government. The oil companies are currently in London negotiating with Azerbaijan officials to develop three Caspian Sea oilfields. The companies are BP, Statoil of Norway, Amoco Production Company, Pennzoil, McDermott International of New Orleans, Union Oil of California, Ramco and the Turkish Petroleum Company. The companies and the Azerbaijani government were pushing to complete at least a significant portion of the negotiations before Mr Elchibey arrived. Oil industry sources said yesterday that although the political confusion was in danger of stalling the negotiations, Azerbaijan remained badly in need of foreign investment and it seemed likely that whoever was running the country would continue the talks. British Petroleum, one of the parties to the proposed deal, said: 'We remain in negotiations with SOCAR, the state oil company, and we expect the deal to go ahead.' Originally, the companies were divided into three negotiating groups to develop three of the republic's fields  - Guneshli, Azeri and Chirag. But last month, the Azerbaijani government decided to put all the companies into one 'unitised' group, and negotiate with all of them for oil development.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] South African farmers are to establish themselves  temporarily in other African states, in terms of a new feeding  policy for the continent.    This emerged after talks held by the Transvaal and [Orange]  Free State Agricultural Unions and the leader of the Freedom  Front, General Constand Viljoen, with the United Nations, the  Commonwealth, and international institutions on a feeding  strategy for South Africa and the rest of the continent. The  president of the Transvaal Agricultural Union, Mr. Dries Bruwer,  said talks would be held on the same issue next week with  President Nelson Mandela and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki. Mr.  Bruwer said South African farmers would give practical help and  advice on crop cultivation. The strategy would initially be  confined to countries south of the equator, but would later be  expanded northwards.    Mr. Bruwer said the plan had to be introduced as soon as  possible to prevent a flood of people from neighboring states.</p>

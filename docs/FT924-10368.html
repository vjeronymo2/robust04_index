			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Books: Deadly campus game - Fiction THE SECRET HISTORY by Donna Tartt Viking Pounds 15.99 (Pounds 9.99,pbk) 525pp DONNA Tartt's first novel, The Secret History, is a frustrating, potentially brilliant book whose every strength seems to be balanced by a flaw. Throughout this dauntingly long work, wit is tempered by cloying pretension, while narrative sweep is constantly caught up on verbosity. The result is a novel that is hard to put down, but harder still to pick up once you do. The story takes place on the Vermont campus of mythical Hampden College. The narrator, Richard Papen, arrives from the wastelands of suburban California, eager to study Classics. He soon finds himself part of an elite group of eccentric students overseen by a puckish professor, Julian Morrow. The head boy, Henry Winter, is an enigmatic, melancholy genius who translates Milton into Latin as a pastime. Also in the group are the effete Francis Abernathy, as well as Camilla and Charles Macaulay, twins who Richard soon suspects might be maintaining their prenatal intimacy in bed. Finally, there is Bunny Corcoran, a big, shambolic preppie who seems oddly out of place in this dead poet's society. Despite the glittering facade, everything is not as it seems with this seemingly perfect squad of privileged young scholars. They have in fact been up to some very nasty extra-curricular activities in the Vermont woods, trying to recreate the Dionysian bacchanals they have studied. In the course of their frenzy a heinous crime is committed, leading to all manner of friction among them until, finally, one of their number is murdered by the rest. Despite a turgid first 100 pages, The Secret History soon develops an undeniable momentum, though not of the sort one would expect - from the opening line we know who the victim is to be. The novel's suspense stems instead from figuring out why he gets it and then watching as guilt and remorse set to work upon the survivors. Tartt gambles boldly by giving us her story's climax up front - the result could have easily been a 200,000-word denouement. Instead, the book's drama comes from its comprehensive depiction of corruption, followed by a complex study of the dynamics of remorse. The more superficial question of whodunit is replaced by the more profound one of why. Unfortunately, the answer Tartt provides is marred by a fundamental silliness. Bacchanals in the Vermont woods? Is she serious? If the author believes she needs such a basis for her story, she would have been far wiser to find its modern equivalent than in having her characters running around in togas, trying to invoke the spirit of a Greek deity before hopping into their BMWs and heading back to the dorm. It makes them seem preposterous and undermines the otherwise powerful drama that ensues. Tartt's book is also subverted by pretension and overwriting. Perhaps this could be excused because her narrator is a callow, bookish undergraduate, but 500 of lines like 'I thought (erroneously) that he dressed like Alfred Douglas, or the Comte de Montesquiou' tend to get under the skin. Erroneously? Then why mention it? To send us scurrying in admiration for our biographical dictionaries? There is also an annoying tendency to pepper the narrative with Greek and Latin phrases (which are dutifully translated for us). It is a shame, because in other places Tartt writes like a peach, especially in the latter stages of the book, where the nightmare of inescapable remorse takes over Richard's life. Most first novels are flawed and after a while the reviewer learns to take these mistakes in stride. For two reasons, this is hard to do with The Secret History. First, the flaws come from authorial condescension rather than inexperience and uncertainty. Nobody likes to be talked down to, especially by a 28 year old who has just sold her film rights for a half million bucks. Second, and worse, the book's flaws work directly against its strengths, robbing such an impressive talent of its sting. Let's hope next time Tartt does not feel she has to try so hard to show us what a clever girl she is. After all, the cleverest thing a writer can do is make the enthralled reader forget she is there.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Too late to catch news Sir, As someone reared on the banal journalistic diet, with scarce news and abundant comment, highlighted in 'A dull day in Germany is. . .' (June 5/6), I know James Morgan missed the obvious reasons: German journalists seem to knock off work at the latest by 5pm and late-breaking stories just do not get into the next morning's newspaper. I have to get my late German news out of the Financial Times and International Herald Tribune. German journalists also seem to dislike leg-work to dig out the real story behind the story and prefer to sit behind their desks to compose the abundant comment.

			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Margins squeezed as CI falls 16% CI Group, the West Midlands-based steel and engineering company, continued to suffer from falling sales volumes and tighter margins. Despite a sharp reduction, from Pounds 711,000 to Pounds 492,000, in interest payable, pre-tax profits for the six months to July 31 amounted to Pounds 1.42m - a decline of 16 per cent on the previous Pounds 1.69m. Turnover dipped 11 per cent to Pounds 35.1m (Pounds 39.4m). However, the interim dividend is maintained at 0.825p, payable from earnings of 1.12p (1.34p) per share. A goodwill write-off of Pounds 377,000 was taken below the line.</p>

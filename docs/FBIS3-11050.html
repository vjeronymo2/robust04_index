			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vice President Virgilio Godoy by </F> unidentified reporters at the Radio Corporacion studios in  Managua; date not given; from the "0900 Surprise" program --  recorded]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] Dr. Godoy, thank you very much for  accepting Radio Corporacion's invitation. We have many  questions in the wake of Mr. Alexander Watson's visit. Certain  political factions are very concerned over the way this  gentleman has referred to the Nicaraguan situation. He said  Nicaraguans must resolve their own problems. In an interview  with us, Luis Sanchez Sancho [secretary general of the  Nicaraguan Socialist Party] indicated that this gentleman  apparently is obsessed with the Sandinists. This is very  discomforting. How did your talks with Mr. Watson go?    [Godoy] I would say our conversation was quite ordinary. Of  course, it was characterized by the simultaneous discussion of a  number of problems. Specifically, the assistant secretary of  state talked about what he and his government deem to be a  special or key concern -- namely, that Nicaragua is giving no  sign of resolving its problems or starting to resolve them, and  that there is no evidence of any progress. Nevertheless, Watson  did not give an opinion as to the reasons behind this delay in  finding solutions.    We discussed various issues, many of which focused on  economic matters, but finally, after a generally broad analysis,  it was concluded by both Watson and those who accompanied him --  namely, Mr. Hamilton and Ambassador Maisto -- that political  issues are at the heart of our crisis. This is because there is  no other way to explain why Nicaragua has failed to show any  growth, even though it has received more economic and financial  aid than Panama and El Salvador combined within the same  timeframe. Moreover, there are no signs of improvement on the  horizon, because there is no evidence that this year will be any  different from previous ones.    The idea that Nicaraguans should resolve their problems by  themselves was again stressed, because there is a clear downward  trend in international financial aid, especially aid coming from  North America. Therefore, if we fail to take advantage of the  aid being offered now, it will be even more difficult to find  solutions in the future.    I told Mr. Watson that the U.S. decision of not meddling in  Nicaragua's internal affairs was very appropriate. I hope,  however, that this will prove to be true, because it is one  thing to say the United States will not meddle, while it is  doing just that in various forms. As I said, it is one thing to  say: Solve your own problems, but what is advisable for you to  do is such and such, while...    [Reporter, interrupting] That is one way of intervening.    [Godoy] What is their position then? This is their position  on our efforts to resolve our own problems from a Nicaraguan  vantage point, with Nicaraguan resources, and with Nicaraguan  solutions.    I think we had a very lively conversation. Every possible  solution and the need to find solutions for the country were  discussed. We cannot figure out where to start because all of  the options or paths that have been explored have virtually  failed, including the path of dialogue, which was frustrated by  an executive branch decision.    Moreover, the UNO [National Opposition Union] majority in  the  National Assembly was also broken by an executive branch  decision. The executive branch is incompetent. It does not know  how to, has not been able to, and has not wanted to efficiently  manage those resources placed at its disposal. We are talking  about several billions of dollars -- not about old cordobas  [chancheros], but billions of dollars. The government even  increased Nicaragua's debt. This government inherited a debt of  about $12 billion, some $5 billion of which was forgiven, and  yet we now owe about $13 billion. In other words, we will be  heavily in debt by the time this government finishes its term,  and, in turn, we will be less capable of correcting the  situation.    We discussed all of these issues with Mr. Watson. We spoke  with absolutely frankness. I told him that it is not only  important for the United States to refrain from intervening, but  that it is also important that it not view things solely from a  U.S. perspective, because, for example, he mentioned to me his  extreme concern over U.S. property that has not yet been  returned. I told him: You are right, but Nicaraguans are not  interested in U.S. property; we are interested in the return of  the property of many thousands of Nicaraguans. This is part of  the strife were are experiencing. This is what is behind the  lack of trust in the country. I noted that this has caused the  government to loose credibility very dramatically. Finally, the  most disturbing result from all of this is that the country has  come under an enormous cloak of juridical uncertainty.    Therefore, nobody wants, desires, or expects to invest  here, because they think we do not have adequate conditions,  considering that our government fails to deliver on its promises  out of sympathy for or fear of the Sandinists, and I pointed  this out to Mr. Watson. This is our reality. The country is  adrift, and it cannot find a starting point for resolving its  problems.    [Reporter] Dr. Godoy, was it brought up to you... [pauses]  Did you bring up the issue of human rights in this country --  the murder of more than 250 Nicaraguan Resistance members and  crimes that have never been solved, such as those involving  Bermudez and Jean Paul? In fact, a report issued by the U.S.  State Department was based on human rights violations in this  country.    [Godoy] We did not touch on this directly, but it was  indirectly discussed in the context of an exchange on the  judicial branch's lack of credibility. In other words, our  judicial system is not meeting the expectations of a true de  jure state. In turn, this does not help people feel safe and  secure. I said to him: If you asked your ambassador in Managua  about the long lines of people at the consulate applying for  visas to travel to the United States, you would certainly be  told that people are again arriving there in the early hours of  the morning and standing in long lines in an attempt to get a  visa to go to the United States. Why is this? Because the  country has failed to provide the conditions to keep people here.    We quickly reviewed this situation because not much can be  done in one hour, which is how long our meeting lasted, but we  did discuss all discussable issues. We also talked about the  problems the government has created for itself. I told him  there are black holes in the government that nobody can explain;  nobody knows what has happened.    A case in point is Cornap [National Corporations of the  Public Sector]. The government has spent three years  privatizing it, but nobody knows what criteria was used, nobody  knows the results of this privatization, and there is no  reliable report; there is nothing. This is the only country  that dishes out money in its privatization process. It is an  extremely poor country, one of the poorest, and yet it dishes  out millions of dollars to privatize. The buyer of a state-owned  company or property not only gets the property for a song --  and, indeed, influence-peddlers are involved here -- but he also  receives millions to start a new life.    All of these things fail to help clarify the situation in  any  way. As I told Romerito [not further identified], on 15 March,  I think, they are about to implement the social mobilization  plan to fire 15,000 state employees, because the size of the  state must be reduced. Nevertheless, it happens that some are  being fired while others are being hired. This government  started with 11 ministries, but now there are 14 of them. There  has been a permanent string of lies. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] What does Mr. Watson think about the Army?    [Godoy] He indicated to me that President Chamorro promised  that General Humberto Ortega will leave the EPS [Sandinist  People's Army] this year. Is this enough? No, it is not. This  is what we have been saying for some time. In a way, the Army  has become its own state; it is not within the state, but above  the state. Such a situation would not be favorable anywhere in  the universe.    There must be a review to ensure that -- if indeed this  institution, which produces nothing more than expenses for the  country, should continue to exist -- then it should be strictly  subordinated to civilian power. It should be subordinated to  civilian power, otherwise, the game will continue. We will  pretend to be doing something that is not being done. This is a  double standard that has created confusion in the country, which  has taken away trust in it, and that has deprived the nation of  juridical certainty. This has helped create the stagnation we  have been facing for so many years. [passage omitted]</p>

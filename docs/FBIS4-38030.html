			<p>BFN     [Text] An official source has stated that the gang of  rebels has not abided by the cease-fire since it was announced  and until now, despite its false claims that it accepted it and  is committed to implement it.    The source said this rebel gang continued its treacherous  attacks against units of the Armed Forces on the Aden axis and  against the brother citizens and residential quarters in the  city. The rebels used naval units and bombarded the positions  of the forces of unity and constitutional legitimacy from the  land and sea. They also intensified air sorties over the Armed  Forces camps in al-Haswah, Dar Sa'd, al-Kamathri, Shaykh  'Uthman, and other areas.    The source stressed that this gang, which sold itself, its  mind, and conscience to the devil, continues its attacks,  thinking that this will enable it to arrive at its objective of  internationalizing the crisis of the domestic sedition which it  flared to serve and execute its failed traitorous scheme against  the people and their unity, security, stability.</p>

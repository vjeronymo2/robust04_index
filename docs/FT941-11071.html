			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / Clinton fires first shot in budget battle The Clinton administration will send its Dollars 1,500bn budget for 1995 to Congress today, firing the opening shot in a tough battle to fit next year's government spending inside the limits set last summer. For the first time in more than two decades the budget will cut discretionary spending, for which amounts are set in each year's budget, below the Dollars 543bn of the current fiscal year, which runs to the end of September. But mandatory spending on entitlement programmes such as social security and medical benefits for the elderly will continue to grow to absorb half of all federal government spending, with interest payments on the national debt accounting for almost 15 per cent more. The 1990 Budget Enforcement Act agreed with Congress by former President George Bush, coupled with the provisions of last year's five-year budget law, have placed a 'hard freeze' on discretionary spending: the caps on such spending will not be adjusted to take account of inflation. The administration has also had to find additional spending cuts to pay for the increased spending Mr Clinton has sought for favoured projects such as job training, education and children's immunisation programmes. The Clinton proposals would kill outright 115 distinct programmes, ranging from lobster research and oilseed export subsidies to public library construction and drug abuse grants, for total savings of Dollars 3.25bn. The defence budget will contribute nearly half of these savings, cancelling the last planned purchases of the H-60 helicopter and the F-16 fighter. Other programmes to see funding cut severely include mass transit subsidies, rural electrification grants and heating aid for poor families. Many of these were listed for cuts last year but were saved by strong congressional support. Helped by low interest rates and the upturn in the US economy in the second half of 1993, the federal budget deficit has dipped well below the levels predicted last summer when Congress passed, by a single vote, the five-year budget plan. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the Treasury secretary, said yesterday the deficit would drop to Dollars 171bn for the 1995 fiscal year and to Dollars 166bn the next year.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Upturn on track despite jobless rise, says Clarke: Inflation increases but stays within target - Retail sales grow Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, yesterday shrugged off fears that the UK recovery was running out of steam, in spite of a sharp rise in unemployment last month. The jobless figures follow monthly falls in manufacturing output and industrial production reported earlier this week, which cast a shadow over the pace of economic expansion. But the pessimism was partly offset by other economic statistics showing that inflation remains under firm control and retail sales are buoyant. In spite of the conflicting messages, the chancellor said he was 'quite confident' the economy was still on course. Although the annual inflation rate in January rose to 2.5 per cent from 1.9 per cent in December, this was a smaller increase than had been expected. Retail sales showed a 0.6 per cent month-on-month improvement. The stock market rose yesterday as traders anticipated that the poor unemployment figures might encourage the government to cut base rates again. The FT-SE 100 index ended 24.5 points higher at 3,417.7, while long gilts added a quarter of a point against the trend in European bond markets. The pound lost a pfennig but closed slightly higher on the day at DM2.5471. The number of people without jobs and claiming benefit increased by a seasonally adjusted 15,500 in January, after falling by 149,800 in the previous four months. This took unemployment to a total of 2.787m, compared with 2.99m a year ago. Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, insisted that the trend in unemployment remained downwards, but said the path was likely to be uneven, especially over holiday periods. 'The pattern appears to be a repeat of what happened over the summer holidays. The trend is still downwards but large falls in some months are followed by small rises in other months,' he said. However, a number of economists said the latest figures pointed to slack in the labour market. 'The rise in unemployment, the fall in vacancies and weakness of overtime, strikes and weekly hours worked all point to a weak economy,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities. Further signs of economic fragility were highlighted by the state of public sector finances. The surplus in January, when the government benefits from seasonal payments of corporation tax, was the lowest since 1979, when monthly statistics were first published. This was partly due to disappointing tax receipts. However, the retail sales figures painted a brighter picture of demand than a recent Confederation of British Industry survey. 'Fears over the pace of recovery are misplaced,' said Mr John Marsland, economist at UBS. 'Sales volumes are growing at annualised rates in excess of 3 per cent, and this should be sustained despite tax increases.' Excluding mortgage rates, inflation in January was 2.8 per cent, up from 2.7 per cent in December but well within the 1-4 per cent target range.

The requirements specify that external floating roof tanks be equipped with certain primary and secondary seals and that fixed-roof tanks be equipped with internal floating roofs with certain types of seals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Following an analysis of State regulations, the Agency estimated that approximately 76 percent of the storage tanks at pipeline breakout stations are of external floating roof design, while 24 percent are of fixed-roof construction. The corresponding numbers for storage tanks at bulk gasoline terminals are 53 and 47 percent, respectively. Further analysis showed that of the external floating roof tanks at pipeline breakout stations, 36 percent have the NSPS and CTG required primary and secondary seals, while 64 percent have only primary seals. At bulk gasoline terminals, the numbers are 43 and 57 percent for the respective seal types. Similarly, of the fixed-roof tanks at pipeline breakout stations, it was estimated that 38 percent have internal floating roofs (72 percent at bulk gasoline terminals) as required by NSPS and recommended by the CTG, while 62 percent are uncontrolled at pipeline breakout stations (28 percent at bulk gasoline terminals).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above analysis, the most recent NSPS standard (40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb) represents the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of existing sources. Thus the floor level of control for storage tanks at both existing pipeline breakout stations and existing bulk gasoline terminals has been determined to be the control level defined in subpart Kb. Since it has not been demonstrated that, in practice, there are any better controls than this level for storage tanks, the level of control defined by 40 CFR part 60, subpart Kb was also selected as the floor level of control for storage tanks at new pipeline breakout stations and bulk gasoline terminals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Degassing and cleaning of tank bottom sediments are necessary to safely retrofit the different or additional seals on existing tanks to meet the floor level of control (subpart Kb requirements). Degassing and cleaning of the bottom of the tank are routine maintenance practices that have been reported to occur at least every ten years. Degassing and cleaning also results in air emissions. As discussed earlier in this preamble, section 112(i)(3) in the Act allows for up to three years to comply with this standard and an additional one-year permit extension. Also there is the additional time between proposal and promulgation. During this three to five year period, it is logical to assume that many of the tanks requiring the retrofit of controls will be experiencing their routine maintenance cleaning and degassing; these tanks could be retrofitted during this time. Thus, for these tanks the retrofitting required by this proposal would not result in earlier degassing and cleaning emissions than would otherwise occur. For those tanks that would not be degassed or cleaned during that period, degassing and cleaning emissions would be required by this proposed rule to occur earlier than normal. This early emissions increase is estimated to be more than off-set by the emission reductions achieved from the required improved seals. Comments and data are requested on any situations where estimated emissions increase will not be off-set by the emission reduction achieved by the controls; for these situation, the data should include the number and description of tanks in this atypical situation, their existing equipment and maintenance history, determinations of the emissions and costs for tank degassing and cleaning, and the basis for any calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The floor level of control for existing storage tanks was discussed earlier and was determined to be the level of control achieved under the NSPS subpart Kb. Gasoline storage tanks meeting the control level in subpart Kb were determined to represent the average emission limitation achieved by the best performing 12 percent of the existing sources. Comments and data are specifically requested on the number of gasoline storage tanks at these facilities with seal types meeting subpart Kb.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Formulation of Regulatory Alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After establishing the MACT floor control levels, the Agency developed regulatory alternatives for the affected subcategories. The first alternative developed was one that specified control levels at the floor for all new and existing major sources. This alternative was designated Alternative IV. Next, various combinations of control options were examined, ranging in stringency from the floor level controls specified in Alternative IV to the most stringent controls for each subcategory. A cost-effectiveness analysis was then performed to eliminate the alternatives with higher costs for the same or lesser emission reductions. A final set of three regulatory alternatives (Alternatives IV, IV&hyph;Q, and IV&hyph;M) was then evaluated as the potential basis for the proposed standards. Alternatives IV&hyph;Q and IV&hyph;M are similar to Alternative IV except, they contain increasingly stringent levels of equipment leak control at existing facilities. The following paragraphs and Table 1 describe these alternatives.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

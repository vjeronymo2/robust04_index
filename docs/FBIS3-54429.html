The bill imposes restrictions on  America's military presence on the international scene and also  America's role in the UN. [passage omitted]    The imposition of such restrictions takes place when America  is emerging from an era of defeats in her interventionist  policies. The failure of America's hypocritical interference in  Bosnia and the disgraceful departure of American soldiers from  Somalia and Haiti forced that country's authorities to minimize  such defeats by creating a legal mechanism.    Although the bill is presented to the congress by the leader  of the Senate Republicans, far from being tantamount to  opposition to the performance of the Democrats abroad, it is  aimed at maintaining America's superiority and global domination  -- a superiority and domination attained at less cost and lower  casualties. For that reason the American statesmen intend to  involve the Congress, in addition to the government and its  representative, in decisionmaking at the United Nations on  participation in overseas operations. Under the bill, the  Congress should be involved and before the government votes for  interventionist activities at the Security Council, it should  consult members of Congress.    The Congress claims that it approved the bill on America's  membership at the United Nations on the condition that it be a  fully fledged partner in that organization's financial and  military decisionmaking. That claim reveals the fact that, to  preserve her status, America has always deferred any fundamental  effort to the United Nations. For that reason, after the  failure in various operations and the inability to finance them,  she asks the United Nations to pay all the expenses relating to  the provision of military forces, equipment, and transport  operations.    According to the leader of the U.S. Senate Republicans, the  joint U.S.-UN operations in Somalia, Bosnia, and Haiti showed  that it is not in America's interests to allow the United  Nations to determine the country's foreign policy. In his view,  the bill will not resolve all the existing differences between  America and the United Nations but, through the participation of  the congress in fundamental decisions, it will result in  America's interests on foreign policy being safeguarded.    Here, one could say that giving credit to the United Nations  would mean something only when it makes decisions in line with  the policies of that country, and the decision of the Security  Council to send forces would only be practical for America if  the cost of the operation is incurred by that organization, with  a minimum of U.S. soldiers lost.</p>

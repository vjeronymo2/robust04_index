			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Banks back China power project: Dollars 120m loan paves the way for further private-sector finance China yesterday signed a Dollars 120m (Pounds 80m) loan agreement with a consortium of international banks for the co-financing with the World Bank of a Dollars 1.3bn power project in Jiangsu province, west of Shanghai. It was China's first co-financing deal involving private institutions under the World Bank's Expanded Co-Financing Operations Programme, and is expected to become a model for other such arrangements. The deal paves the way for increased commercial lending to China's infrastructure development programme. In the power sector alone, it is estimated that China will require Dollars 10bn-Dollars 12bn a year for the next few years to fund its requirements in the light of anticipated economic growth of 9 per cent-10 per cent a year to the end of this decade. The World Bank is lending Dollars 350m to the project, which will entail building two 600-megawatt coal-fired generators in Yangzhou city, about 100km north-east of Nanjing, Jiangsu's capital. JP Morgan of the US, Bank of Tokyo, and Dresdner Bank of Germany are arranging a Dollars 90m syndicated loan, while Nippon Life Insurance of Japan will provide a yen facility worth Dollars 30m. Morgan executives said the loan, in which China's finance ministry represented the People's Republic, appealed to China because of the long maturities and the fact that the interest rate was some 40-60 basis points below market rates. The Dollars 120m loan carries a 15-year final maturity and a five-year grace period. Repayments of principal after the 10th year are guaranteed by the World Bank. The bank's involvement encouraged the commercial banks to lend, whereas, in the past, many have been wary of repayment difficulties in infrastructure projects. Debt financing for the Yangzhou plant is an alternative to Build Operate Transfer arrangements for the power sector. Beijing is currently embroiled in a dispute with financiers over what might be considered adequate returns for such a financing arrangement for a power project. The World Bank has made clear that it favours greater private-sector involvement in the funding of infrastructure projects. Mr Ernest Stern, the bank's managing director, has said that such participation could 'bring additional benefits that go beyond finance, including management expertise and new technology.' Funding for the Yangzhou power station, one of China's largest energy projects, will also come from the State Energy Investment Corporation, local Jiangsu institutions, and the Yangzhou Municipality. Other banks involved in the syndicated loan include the Korea Development Bank, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and Mitsubishi Bank.</p>

			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Cracking the China syndrome - Foreign companies are discovering consumer affluence in a fast growing market China has been a beguiling business opportunity for almost 200 years. In the 19th century it was the Manchester cotton spinners' dream to put a shirt on the back of every Chinese. Today the dream remains the same, it is just the product that has changed. Nestle, the Swiss food company, is making a concerted push to expand its business in China. It recently bought the China assets of Dairy Farm, the Jardine Matheson-controlled Hong Kong-based dairy products manufacturer, to add to its existing interests in baby food products. Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, has entrenched itself in Guangdong, China's fastest growing province, while its detergent advertisements can be viewed on television in Beijing. Seven-Eleven, the mini-mart franchise chain owned by Dairy Farm, has established itself in Shenzhen, a special economic zone to the north of Hong Kong; Dickson Concepts, a Hong Kong retailer of luxury goods and owner of London's Harvey Nichols department store, is planning to manufacture and retail a line of luxury items specifically targeted at the Chinese consumer. The increasing corporate interest in China's consumer market is linked to the growing affluence of an increasing minority of China's 1.2bn people. But a recent study by McKinsey*, the US multinational consultancy, shows that companies wishing to tap the market should direct their efforts at the sizeable and growing pockets of wealth in China. The study estimates that there are currently 60m Chinese consumers earning at least Dollars 1,000 (Pounds 657) a year, a level at which substantial consumerism becomes apparent, according to McKinsey. Today 'consumers in the more affluent areas of China may well be as rich as, or richer than, the average Malaysian, Thai or Indonesian consumer'. China's 60m-strong consumer market compares with 15m-20m for Malaysia, 25m for Taiwan and more than 40m in Korea. By the end of the century the number of affluent consumers could rise more than three-fold to 200m when China will have a market for consumer durables that is, in terms of purchasing power and population, larger than most of the east and south-east Asian markets today. The affluent consumers, however, are not concentrated in one area. The main markets are in southern China - Shenzhen and Guangzhou (Canton) - Shanghai and, in the north, Beijing and the nearby industrial city of Tianjin. McKinsey reckons that by 2000, 11 other cities and provinces will reach an average per capita income level of Dollars 1,000. Nor is the market unified. China is a country of regions, many of which have been encouraged by past government policy to aim for self-sufficiency. One of the goals of China's economic reforms is to achieve a unified domestic market by improving internal distribution. For the foreign manager, as McKinsey points out: 'In a country with a notoriously overburdened transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, carefully planned and effectively executed distribution and sales activities will inevitably prove key factors for success.' There are signs that China is relaxing the rules and allowing private companies to operate their own distribution networks. In electronics, foreign joint ventures can now establish proprietary distribution and sales networks that allow direct access to consumers. This enables companies to bypass the state-controlled wholesale system. Another beneficial change for foreign companies is that they now have greater freedom to recruit managers directly from universities, government ministries and state-owned industry. Foreign companies offer not only higher levels of pay but also a work environment that many Chinese professionals find more appealing than traditional state industry. One Hong Kong computer and telecommunications equipment manufacturer, for example, had little trouble recently in recruiting more than 70 graduates in engineering from Beijing's best universities to work for it in Guangdong. *A fresh look at China, Stephen M Shaw and Jonathan R Woetzel, McKinsey Quarterly, No 3, 1992.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE REFUSES TO THROW OUT SUIT OVER GOP GUARDS AT POLLS  </P> <P> A federal judge refused Monday to dismiss a lawsuit brought against the Orange  County Republican Party and others over the use of uniformed security guards at  polling places in 20 largely Latino precincts in Santa Ana on Election Day.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge J. Spencer Letts also said he does not believe that the  success of the lawsuit hinges on whether the guards actually deterred anyone  from voting.  </P> <P> "If true, it was an outrage," Letts said of the lawsuit's allegations that the  guards interfered with voters as they tried to cast ballots.  </P> <P> Later, responding to a suggestion by attorney David A. Robinson that the  plaintiffs could not prove that even one voter did not cast a ballot because of  the guards, Letts said: "Yeah, but I think that's irrelevant."  </P> <P> U.S. citizens have a right to believe that they will not be subjected to  intrusion on their private rights on the way to the polls, Letts said, "so I  don't care whether they voted or not."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 3 Latino Groups, Union Excluded  </P> <P> However, in a tentative ruling, Letts refused to allow three Latino groups and  a labor union to continue as plaintiffs in the case, saying they did not have  standing to sue. He also left in doubt whether he would allow one of the six  other individual plaintiffs to remain in the case.  </P> <P> The guards were hired at the suggestion of a political consultant for  Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), a defendant in the suit. Pringle won  the 72nd Assembly District election by fewer than 900 votes after a campaign  that cost the candidates a total of $1.9 million.  </P> <P> Thomas A. Fuentes, the county GOP chairman who is also a defendant in the  lawsuit, has said that he authorized about $4,000 in party money to hire the  guards because of rumors that illegal voters were to be bused in to tip the  election in favor of the Democratic candidate, Christian F. (Rick) Thierbach.  </P> <P> The lawsuit alleges that the guards, who were carrying signs in Spanish  admonishing non-citizens not to vote, intimidated first-time Latino voters and  may have frightened them away from the polls. It asks that the election results  be overturned.  </P> <P> Letts' decision followed a hearing of 1 hour and 40 minutes in Santa Ana  federal court in which eight attorneys representing various defendants tried to  narrow the case.  </P> <P> Letts agreed with the defendants that much remains to be proven in the suit. He  also said he expects that the case will be on a "fast track" -- an indication  that much might be decided in pretrial motions rather than in lengthy  litigation.  </P> <P> But he added: "As it sits, based on the allegations, somebody's made a serious  mistake. Somebody thought this was an OK thing to do in what appeared to be a  hotly contested race. It wasn't an OK thing to have done."  </P> <P> Letts indicated that to make their case, the plaintiffs would probably need to  prove only that the guards actually interfered in some manner with voters.  </P> <P> He left open the question of whether he would allow one of the plaintiffs, Jose  Diaz Vargas, to remain in the suit, even though his polling place was not one  of those where guards were posted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delay in Casting Ballot  </P> <P> Kathleen J. Purcell, the San Francisco lawyer who is representing the  plaintiffs, said Vargas put off voting because he had heard on the radio that  there were guards at the polls.  </P> <P> Vargas therefore was affected by the use of the guards, even though he did not  actually encounter a guard on his way to vote, she argued.  </P> <P> Purcell said after the hearing that the groups eliminated as plaintiffs -- the  Hispanic Political Council; the Laborers' International Union of North America,  Local 652; the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the Latino Issues  Forum -- would continue to support the lawsuit.  </P> <P> She said that overall she is pleased with the tentative ruling because it  "indicates that the judge understands the fact that the guards should not have  been there."  </P> <P> Darryl R. Wold, attorney for Fuentes and several other defendants, said after  the hearing that he is pleased that half of the plaintiffs were refused  standing to sue.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is whether the defendants' poll watchers did the things that  the complaint alleges they did," Wold said. "We vigorously deny that they did  those things."  </P></p>

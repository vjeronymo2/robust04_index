"These may be preliminary talks, but they are quite important,"  said EFTA spokesman Jorg Renk. The two delegations began  discussing a draft free trade agreement, prepared by EFTA  experts. In its form and content, the draft is very similar to  agreements between EFTA and other central European countries.  The delegations also agreed that Slovenia should prepare a list  of products on which import taxes will be gradually lowered by  2001. Slovenia is to hold bilateral talks with EFTA member  countries on agriculture. Vojka Ravbar, the state secretary at  the Ministry of Economic Relations and Development, is heading  the Slovene delegation in negotiations, while Joseph Mayer,  deputy director general of the Austrian Ministry of Economic  Affairs, is the head of the EFTA delegation. A new round of  talks between Slovenia and EFTA is scheduled in the spring.  However, no exact date was set, since simultaneous talks are  also planned between Slovenia and the European Union. "We  observe the principle of strictly parallel meetings with the  EU," Renk said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By INTERFAX observer Dmitriy Voskoboynikov; from the </F> "Novosti" newscast]    [Text] Could it be said that the Bosnian crisis is leading  to the first serious manifestation of discord between Russia and  NATO? Moscow does not want to paint a gloomy picture. Foreign  Minister Kozyrev, with whom I spoke on Friday, stressed the  importance of supporting the strategic partnership with the  West, including in resolving the Bosnian problems. Evidently he  will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in the  second half of March - it is unlikely it can be managed earlier  - to discuss how that can best be achieved.    However, the Foreign Ministry's attitude to the NATO  ultimatums is unequivocal. Their time has passed and if they  are put forward once again with regard to one or another of the  warring sides in Bosnia without consultation with Russia that  will be simply a farce. The Kremlin is reacting calmly to the  fact that some G-7 caricaturists have returned to the image of  the Russian Bear. Both Yeltsin and Kozyrev state with  satisfaction: A Bosnian settlement is not possible without  Russia.    Will their opponents, who earlier demanded the resignation  of the head of the Foreign Ministry practically every week, get  into parliament?    However, nervousness has arisen in relations between Moscow  and Washington, which obviously was not prepared for decisive  Russian diplomacy. At least, many have formed the impression  that the fuss which arose around the Ames couple in the United  States was whippped up not in the least because Russia's  excessive independence on the Bosnia issue was not to  everybody's liking.    [Begin Kozyrev recording] It is difficult to get away from  the impression that what we're dealing with are attempts by  certain circles to provoke a kind of exacerbation, on the one  hand, to cast suspicion on Sarajevo, on the other hand -- I have  to say, on the whole, that in the United States, and in our  country, Russia, too, there are numerous examples of that -- the  partnership between the two great powers is not to everybody's  liking. Therefore, I think that it is difficult to get away  from the impression that it's a provocation we are dealing with.  [end recording]</p>

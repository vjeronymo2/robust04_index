			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / City anger at community service order for Levitt: Judge says sentence is 'commensurate' - SFO denies error over plea bargain The Serious Fraud Office was at the centre of another controversy yesterday when Mr Roger Levitt, the former financial services salesman who pleaded guilty to fraud after his company collapsed with losses of Pounds 34m, walked free from court. Mr Levitt, who headed one of the most successful financial services companies of the mid-1980s, was ordered to carry out 180 hours of community service by Mr Justice Laws following a plea bargain with the SFO's lawyers. The Levitt Group, which collapsed in December 1990, attrac-ted celebrities such as former athlete Mr Sebastian Coe, now an MP, and entertainer Adam Faith to act as directors of its subsidiaries. Its most famous individual loser was the writer Mr Frederick Forsyth, who lost Pounds 900,000. The sentence imposed on Mr Levitt, following a three-year investigation and prosecution by the SFO, provoked widespread anger among both investors who lost money in the collapse of the Levitt Group and City regulators. The SFO defended its decision not to proceed with 21 charges against Mr Levitt and Mr Mark Reed, the group's former managing director, a week into the trial. These included obtaining property and services by deception, forgery, false accounting and making misleading statements. In return, the two men pleaded guilty to a severely limited part of the indictment against them - a fraudulent trading charge involving the deception of Fimbra, the self-regulatory body for financial advisers. The SFO yesterday denied this had been a misjudgment, saying that the offence the two men pleaded guilty to - which carried a possible seven year jail sentence - adequately reflected their criminality and that the trial judge alone was responsible for deciding sentences. Passing sentence, Mr Justice Laws said he could only sentence on the charges to which the two men had pleaded guilty. These were comparable to breaches of the Financial Services Act carrying a two-year sentence. Given their loss of reputations and fortunes, community service orders were 'commensurate', he said. In such cases the attorney-general can not appeal against a sentence on grounds of leniency. Afterwards a beaming Mr Levitt said he was 'a great believer in British justice'. The bankrupt entrepreneur - who will now become a vacuum cleaner salesman - planned to celebrate by getting drunk. 'I will have to borrow the money first,' he added. Fimbra said sentencing was a matter for the courts. However, Mr Jim Gaskin, the Fimbra director of enforcement responsible for the Levitt case, admitted there was considerable unhappiness at the outcome of the trial. 'Low sentences for fraud give out the wrong signals to both those who suffer from fraud and those who perpetrate it,' he said. The outcome also caused dismay among lawyers acquainted with the case. Concern centred on how an investigation and prosecution which cost millions of pounds could end with sentences of community service orders. 'It looks very bad. I feel ashamed,' said one lawyer as he left the courtroom. 'It's extraordinary - a scandal,' said a QC who specialises in fraud cases. The sentence was attacked by Labour front bench spokesperson Ms Marjorie Mowlam, who said: 'The decision is an insult to many people who suffered at the hands of Levitt.' One investor said: 'He (Mr Levitt) should pay for what he has done.' Mr Reed was ordered to do 120 hours of community service. A third defendant, Mr Alan MacNamara, who admitted a charge of recklessly furnishing misleading information to Fimbra, will be sentenced on Wednesday.</p>

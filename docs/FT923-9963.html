			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / EC's banana split A plan to heal a damaging split in European Community ranks over bananas was approved by the Commission yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels. The Commission proposal would impose quotas on imports from 1993. It would mean a basic quota of 2m tonnes for 1993. Imports would be subject to customs duty of 20 per cent, except for those from African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, whose sales are protected in a pact with the EC and are not subject to duty.</p>

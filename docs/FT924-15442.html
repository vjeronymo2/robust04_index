			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / The European Market: International groups wary of Swiss tunnel project - Domestic companies' apparent advantages are deterring foreign tenders THERE is a tantalising clause in the Alpine transit treaty between Switzerland and the European Community specifying that contracts exceeding Ecu5m (Pounds 3.9m) in value for the massive SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.7bn) Swiss alpine tunnel project should be open to international tenders. Since Swiss voters approved the project in a referendum last week, one might expect the big European construction companies to be lining up for applications. Not so, according to Swiss analysts. The release of tenders is still a long way off, and foreign companies are likely to have difficulty beating the leading Swiss contractors anyway, as the Swiss have long experience of tunnelling and much specialised equipment and personnel in place. Also, as Credit Suisse hinted in a recent study, governments can usually find ways to make sure domestic companies do well on big public projects, even when international tenders are used. 'The application of Swiss laws on wages, welfare payments and health and safety at work should prevent a major share of the pie from disappearing down the throats of foreign companies,' the study says. According to the government's schedule, boring of the first 50km tunnel through the Gotthard should get under way at the beginning of 1996. In the meantime there are some large planning and design contracts to be let within the next few months by the Swiss Federal Railways, the Gotthard project manager. Swiss analysts assume a consortium led by Elektrowatt, the Swiss energy and engineering company, will win most of this work; the group designed the Gotthard road tunnel built in the late 1970s. But Elektrowatt itself, even though it has already participated in pre-design work, is less confident. 'It is completely open. We will compete hard, but there will be surprises,' predicts Mr Max Bruggmann, director of Elektrowatt Engineering. Similarly, for the 30km tunnel through the Lotschberg, the Swiss engineering group Emch &amp; Berger seems well placed, having already done pre-design work for Bern-Lotschberg-Simplon Bahn, the manager of that line. When it comes to building tunnels, the leading Swiss construction groups, Losinger, Stuag, Zschokke and Zublin, certainly have the experience. The Swiss expect that some big European groups, such as Philipp Holzmann of Germany and Cogefer and Lodiciani of Italy, will bid. France's Lafarge Coppee, with its control of Cementia, is expected to compete strongly with the Swiss Holderbank to supply construction materials, but the highly specialised Swiss Sika Finanz group should win the contracts for tunnel joints. Swiss companies - led by ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Von Roll and Schindler  - will also be strong competitors for the estimated SFr1.2bn in locomotive and rolling stock orders, although foreign suppliers, including Siemens, figure strongly in signalling equipment. Nevertheless, in a project of this size there should be considerable smaller sub-contracts for specialist manufacturers in other European countries. Mr Michael Berger, of the Austrian Trade Commission in Zurich, says his office is planning a symposium on the project for Austrian companies next spring. Mr Serge Ledermann, of Geneva bankers Lombard Odier, says one consequence of making the tendering international is that the fat margins Swiss contractors normally get on their business will be squeezed. And the fact that the work will be spread over 15 years means the impact on profits of any particular company is not likely to be great.</p>

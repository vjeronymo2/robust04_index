			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / International Company News: Seeking a fortune in London - The listing of the first 'red chip' company A REVERSE takeover of a UK listed company by a Hong Kong trading concern as a means of increasing sales of oil to communist China might seem a rather tortuous way of going about it. But such is the deal which will lead to the appearance of a new name on the London stock exchange tomorrow: Fortune Oil. The company has emerged from the acquisition by Blackland Oil, a USM-traded company, of Kingsleigh Petroleum of Hong Kong. Blackland had suffered a string of lossmaking years and was heavily indebted. But its reverse takeover by Kingsleigh will enable it to issue Pounds 27m of new shares to the vendors, and make a placing of Pounds 10m additional shares in the market. Blackland's original shareholders will end up owning only one per cent of Fortune stock, Kingsleigh's owners will have 70 per cent, and the rest of the shareholders will come through the placing. The deal was constructed in this way to enable Kingsleigh to tap the London market's large oil and gas sector and obtain a listing. The Hong Kong market lists no oil and gas companies and gave Kingsleigh no prospect of being able to do the deal on its home turf, according to Mr Malcolm Stone, the vice chairman. He expects to pick up 500-600 shareholders through the placing. Kingsleigh was set up in 1989 to trade crude oil and petroleum products mainly with China, with which it has close links. Its shareholders (who will now be in Fortune) include the founding families from the Far East, as well as several Chinese state corporations, such as China National Electronics Import &amp; Export, China National Aero-Technology Import and Export, and China North Industries. In fact, it is believed that Fortune will become the London Exchange's first 'red chip' company with direct Chinese state ownership. The immediate prospects of Fortune are built round China's expected need for fast-rising oil imports. With an annual growth rate of 9 per cent, the economy is outstripping the capacity of its domestic oil industry. Although China is a large oil producer, it cannot meet its needs in full, and its best reserves are located in the north west of the country, far from the consuming centres. This has produced shortages in the booming provinces of the south east, where enterprises have been released from their obligation to import oil through the state oil monopoly. Fortune has a scheme to install a floating mooring 15km off the south China coast linked by subsea pipeline to the mainland Guangdong province. This will enable oil to be delivered to China in much larger crude carriers than can currently access its ports, and therefore more cheaply. The installation will be in operation by the end of next year with a capacity of 200,000 barrels a day, or 10m tonnes a year. There will also be storage facilities on shore. The project will cost Dollars 25m (Pounds 17m) which is being financed by a bank loan. Fortune has a take-or-pay contract for 3m tonnes a year with the Maoming refinery which is linked to the landing point by a pipeline. This will rise to 5m tonnes in 1998. Maoming is also a shareholder in Fortune with 2.6 per cent stake. Mr Ng Juak Khoon, a Fortune executive, stresses that while the mooring buoy is key to the strategy, he sees it as the basis for a much wider business in China which will include trading petroleum products and even liquefied natural gas. 'The buoy is an extension of our trading business,' he says. At present there are only two refineries serving the six Chinese provinces within striking distance of the facility, but three more are planned. Proceeds of the Pounds 10m placing will help pay down debt and leave the group with about Pounds 5m for additional investments. Some of this will be used in the UK where Blackland has interests in some small oilfields in Lincolnshire. But investor interest in Fortune will doubtless centre most closely on the 'China factor' - the country's rapid rate of growth and its growing commercialisation. However Mr Ian Taylor, the chief operating officer, says: 'We don't want the China hype. We want the China interest.'</p>

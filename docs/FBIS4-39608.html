			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Dmitriy Gorokhov, Nikita </F> Yermakov and Igor Shchegolev]    [Text] Paris June 8 -- Russia will send a peace-keeping  contingent to Abkhazia within the next few days, Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev said.    Meeting journalists at the Russian embassy in Paris on  Wednesday, Kozyrev said that no other country is ready to follow  Russia's suit so far. The decision to send peace-keepers to the  war zone has nothing to do with the imperial policy or  irresponsibility, he added. This is a normal policy of a  responsible country which closely cooperates with the United  Nations and the Conference on Security and Cooperation in  Europe, he said.</p>

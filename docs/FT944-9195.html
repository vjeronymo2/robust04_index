			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: Buy programme drives Footsie through 3,100 - Market Report It was virtually all good news yesterday for a London stock market celebrating a series of specialist deals, including a Pounds 500m share buy-back by one of the leading FT-SE 100 stocks, a huge buy programme, a highly successful bought deal and a series of excellent company news items. Added to that heady cocktail was another strong performance by Wall Street, which gained ground shortly after the opening yesterday ahead of the outcome of the crucial Federal Open Market Committee meeting in Washington. Wall Street shrugged aside another batch of economic data from the US indicating strong growth in the economy. At the close of trading, and with no news from the FOMC meeting available to the market, the FT-SE 100 Index fulfilled recent market optimism, sweeping confidently through the 3,100 barrier and closing a net 40.1 higher at 3,135.4. Second-line stocks shared in the buoyant mood of the market, the FT-SE Mid 250 ending 22.6 stronger at 3,560.7. And there was a general air of optimism around City trading desks, with dealers adopting the view that, within reason, the UK market would take whatever was thrown at it by the Federal Reserve. 'If we get 50 basis points, the market will say it is already in the prices; if we get 75 or even 100 points, the bond market will love it and we will hang on to their coat tails,' was the view of one top trader in London, although he cautioned that the market would definitely not appreciate an absence of movement by the Federal Reserve. The rate rise of  3/4 percentage point was subsequently announced. The overall bullish view was reinforced by a surge of activity in derivatives markets, where turnover was said to have been the heaviest since mid-September. Turnover expanded rapidly throughout the session to reach 961.4m shares, the highest seen for many weeks, with non-Footsie stocks accounting for an unusually low 39 per cent of the total. Dealers picked up the scent of a big market operation before the opening and prices across the board were marked better at the outset, when the FT-SE 100 was around 10 points ahead. News that Boots had sent its broker SG Warburg into the market to buy in around 10 per cent of its shares drove Boots sharply higher until the buy-back operation was satisfied. Boots' move came 24 hours after it sold its pharmaceuticals division to BASF, the German chemicals company. At the same time, AMP Australia, the life assurance group, sold its 3.2 per cent holding in Hammerson to Smith New Court, the UK securities house, who quickly placed the stock in the market, taking a 3p a share turn in the process. While these deals were being unwound, Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, moved in to execute a Pounds 160m-plus buy programme, spanning the FT-SE 100 and 250 indices. These three big operations accounted for more than 270m shares, or 28 per cent of turnover in the market yesterday. At its best, just before the close, the FT-SE 100 was more than 42 points up, with dealers reporting only light profit-taking towards the close. Company trading reports provided numerous features, including De La Rue, the banknote printing group, whose shares sprinted to an all-time high after excellent results, while PowerGen fulfilled even the most optimistic dividend forecasts. General Accident was the one real disappointment in the market as the steep fall in the insurance group's net asset value, and middle of the range third-quarter profits, left the market unimpressed. The best performance among the FT-SE 100 stocks came from Standard Chartered, viewed by many chartists as in the initial stages of a big upside break; dealers noted heavy turnover in Standard shares.</p>

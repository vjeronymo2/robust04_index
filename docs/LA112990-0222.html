If  an arrest is made, the suspect could face fines and up to 10 years in prison  for making false statements on a postal form and for obstructing mail delivery.  </P> <P> Chnge-of-address forms, all with the names of different people on them, were  sent to post offices in Montana, Idaho and Hawaii. The case cane to light when  the postal patrons whose names were used on the forms complained to their local  postal officials that they were not receiving their mail.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Riga, Jun 22, BNS -- A group of U.S. specialists  finish their work in Riga on Wednesday after having got  acquainted with the new installation of the Skrunda radar  compound to prepare recommendations how to dismantle it and how  much the dismantling will cost.    The American and Latvian experts coordinated the basic  issues  of two draft agreeements on the dismantling of the building,  said Latvia's representative Aivars Vovers. As reported, the  U.S. Government pledged 2 million USD to dismantle the facility.    Latvia will receive similar recommendations from Swedish  experts who also visited the radar site this week.    Latvia should prepare itself a concept to channel the  foreign  assistance to the concrete dismantlers, which will be chosen  during a competition, said Vovers. The time of the next meeting  depends on the speed of processing of the acquired information.  Latvia is interested in speeding up the process, Vovers noted.</p>

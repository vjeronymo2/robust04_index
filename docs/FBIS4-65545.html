			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["rds"-signed report: "SPD Divided Over Austerity Course"] </F>   [Excerpt] Bonn, 17 May -- An open conflict has broken out  within the Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] over the  party's course on financial and social policies. The chairman  of the SPD's employees' association, Rudolf Dressler,  contradicted the Deputy SPD chairman and "shadow finance  minister" in Rudolf Scharping's election team, Oskar Lafontaine,  who advocated a tough austerity course that might also affect  social benefits. Such announcements are "not legitimate at  all," Dressler stated in Bonn yesterday. Neither the section of  the draft of the SPD government program on economic policy nor  the part on social policy include intentions to cut social  benefits, Dressler stressed. [passage omitted]</p>

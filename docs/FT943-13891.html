			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Italian coalition partners trade blows: Events which have led to the government's difficulties The agony of Italy's narrow defeat by Brazil in last night's World Cup final in Los Angeles will deepen the gloom in Rome where a divided cabinet led by prime minister Silvio Berlusconi nears a government crisis. Angry exchanges between ministers about the decree to limit the use of preventive detention, announced last week, have exposed the fragility and self-interest which characterises the three-party coalition. The populist Northern League, which has the largest single number of deputies in parliament among the coalition members, is clearly embarrassed by having put its signature to the decree as it has championed the rooting out of corruption. Thus the sight of hundreds of businessmen, politicians and officials being allowed to leave prison where they have been held on preventive detention on corruption charges requires much explaining to League supporters. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League's leader, has offered full support to Mr Roberto Maroni, who as minister for home affairs and deputy prime minister is the party's senior representative in the cabinet. Mr Maroni has said he was misled by cabinet colleagues about the contents of the decree and is ready to resign his ministerial post. He also said he had been assured that the use of a decree, which has immediate effect, rather than draft legislation had been agreed with opposition parties. His stance prompted Mr Giuliano Ferrara, minister for parliamentary relations and press spokesman for Mr Berlusconi's government, to describe Mr Maroni as politically infantile and amateur. Mr Ferrara belongs to Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. Mr Maroni said he had been assured that the decree would not lead to the release from prison of persons accused of corruption. However, it is hard to believe that someone as astute as Mr Maroni was unaware of the implications of the decree. All the political parties had been arguing over its contents for at least two weeks. The third coalition member, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance, has equally prided itself on being an anti-corruption party. As a result Mr Berlusconi has been isolated by his two partners, which are both concerned to prevent their separate identities from being submerged under his Forza Italia. The coalition parties had been fully warned about the damaging consequences in the eyes of the public of appearing to throw in the towel over the corruption scandals. The Amato government nearly fell in 1993 when it tried to push through what was seen as legislation pardoning the bulk of those involved in the scandals. There were demonstrations in Milan on Saturday against the decree, and in favour of the team of investigating magistrates who resigned last week in protest. Opinion polls taken after the decree seem to confirm that it is unpopular. Polls for the daily newspaper l'Unita show that nearly three-quarters consider that the decree is wrong. Only one in seven believes that Mr Berlusconi is right. More than three-quarters of the paper's sample support Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the head of the team of investigating magistrates. Under fire from the public, press, opposition parties and one of his coalition members, Mr Berlusconi counter-attacked on Saturday, listing 12 points to justify the decree. Among these were the crowded conditions in Italian prisons and the slow process of justice. Mr Berlusconi said that remanding in custody should be an exception and only used for serious offences. He added that it was the duty of the prime minister to defend the weak and that any modifications to the decree should reduce still further custody for suspects. Motives other than concern for weaker citizens have, however, been attributed to the commitment of Mr Berlusconi and Mr Alfredo Biondi, his justice minister, to the decree. Mr Maroni noted that one of the effects of the decree has been to put a brake on investigations into corruption cases involving the fiscal police in Milan, where important revelations had been thought imminent. One of the first beneficiaries of the decree was Mr Biondi's former Liberal party colleague, Mr Francesco De Lorenzo, former health minister. The League will use all its influence to try to have the decree withdrawn. Since it could use its strength in parliament to block it passing through both houses, this is a real threat. Mr Berlusconi can use only one card - the threat of early elections. Until now this threat has been credible against his dissident partners because he has been riding high in the opinion polls and would almost certainly improve his position at their expense. But the impact of his conduct over the decree on public opinion suggests he could now be weakened in the eyes of the electorate.</p>

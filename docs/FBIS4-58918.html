			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 7 May (MENA)-- President Husni Mubarak has  stated that his talks with Turkish President Suleyman Demirel  today focused on bilateral ties and cooperation, particularly in  the field of joint ventures, banks, trade, and tourism.    The president said at a news conference he held with  President Demirel this afternoon that the talks also dealt with  various topical issues in the Arab region, in addition to  international issues.    Commenting on developments in Yemen, President Mubarak  affirmed that there is absolutely no plan to send Arab troops to  Yemen, noting that he warned the Yemeni president and his vice  president before the fighting erupted. He said that the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry had previously addressed appeals to  the Yemeni parties in this connection.    President Mubarak remarked that it is the entire Yemeni  people who will suffer from that fighting.    Touching on Egyptian-Turkish bilateral issues, Mubarak noted  that the joint higher committee involving the two countries will  meet in June or July to discuss scopes of cooperation in detail.    Turkish President Suleyman Demirel said that his visit to  Egypt reaffirms the deep ties that have linked the two  countries. He said that Egypt and Turkey are major regional  states and that they both seek to bring about peace and  stability in the region to serve the people's interests.    Demirel added that he congratulated President Mubarak on the  signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement on autonomy in Gaza  and Jericho in Cairo last Wednesday. He remarked that the  Egyptian policy in this context is consistently successful.    Touching on the economic embargo on Iraq and its impact on  Turkey, and whether he had discussed this issue with President  Mubarak, Demirel said: The issue was raised during the talks.  He pointed out that the international community is not prepared  to do anything to lift that embargo at present.    President Mubarak opened the news conference with a speech  in which he welcomed the Turkish president to Egypt. He said:  We made it a habit to meet every once in a while to exchange  views on hot issues and those of common interest in the Middle  East, as well as other issues like Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Mubarak added: We focused in our talks on bilateral  relations and discussed many issues in this context. The  president noted that a businessmen's delegation will visit  Istanbul in June. He also said that they agreed to hold a  meeting of the joint Egyptian-Turkish higher committee in June  or July to be cochaired by the prime ministers of both countries  to discuss bilateral agreements. We consider these agreements  very important because we think of Turkey as a major and central  regional state and we want to maintain strong and good ties with  it, Mubarak said.    President Demirel then delivered a speech in which he  thanked  President Mubarak and said: It is my pleasure to visit Egypt as  a guest of my dear brother President Husni Mubarak. I feel I am  in my home in this great country because the close ties between  Egypt and Turkey are built on foundations of a common cultural  and historical heritage.    He said those bonds strengthen fraternal relations between  the peoples of Egypt and Turkey. He said every high-level visit  between the two countries prove the depth of bilateral  relations. He said the two countries, which he described as  crossroads for several continents, have common political  objectives.    President Demirel said Egypt and Turkey are trying to  achieve  economic development while sparing no effort to help bring about  peace and stability in their common region.    He added: During our talks today, our exchange of viewpoints  was fruitful. We reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation  and stressed during the talks that there is not any difference  in our views toward political issues.    Demirel went on: We agreed that the relations of economic  cooperation between Egypt and Turkey need further efforts and  support to match the strong political relations between us.    He stressed that stronger cooperation will reflect  positively  on the peoples of the whole region. He explained that Egypt and  Turkey are the biggest countries in the region, and they both  feel they are responsible for the region's peace and stability.    President Demirel said that he and President Mubarak  discussed several regional problems and reviewed the situation  in the Balkans and in the Caucasus. The former Soviet Union is  being restructured and we are interested in such matters because  they affect both Egypt and Turkey.    President Demirel said he was pleased with his meeting with  President Mubarak. He added: I congratulated President Mubarak  on the success of his efforts, which were rewarded by the  signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Agreement in Cairo. I also  told him that he should consider the signing of this agreement  his birthday present.    The Turkish president expressed hope that the 50-year-old  Middle East conflict will come to an end and that a new vista of  opportunity will open for Egyptian-Turkish cooperation. He said  that the two countries should walk "hand in hand" toward a new  horizon of peace and prosperity in the region.    The two leaders then fielded questions by journalists.    Answering a question on the events in Yemen, President  Mubarak said: "I wish to make it clear that we warned the Yemeni  president of the implications of the Yemeni crisis, even before  the fighting started. I told the Yemenis that their troops are  deployed close to each other and that unless they separate them,  fighting may break out and will be hard to stop. They did not  listen."    I sent several appeals to the Yemeni president and the  Egyptian Foreign Ministry did the same, Mubarak said. I told  Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih: "It would be wise if you  separate the troops and try to calm down the situation. You  have to sit together and work out your differences. Otherwise,  the entire Yemeni people will suffer."    President Mubarak added: "Fighting then erupted in Yemen.  They are exchanging shells and accusations. They bombarded  each other's airports."    The Arab League is today meeting at the level of  representatives, Mubarak said. He added: I do not think that  there are any plans to send Arab forces to Yemen. Newspaper  reports to this effect do not match reality. I think that all  the Arab League can do is appeal for an end to the fighting and  for a peaceful solution that would enable the Yemenis to go on  with their lives. The current fighting is a loss for all  Yemenis, Mubarak stated.    Answering a question on Egyptian-Turkish cooperation,  Mubarak  said: We have discussed several areas of cooperation, including  tourism, but I do not wish to go into detail. The Higher  Egyptian-Turkish Committee, which is cochaired by the two prime  ministers, will discuss various aspects of cooperation, such as  joint projects and banking agreements. Mubarak pointed out that  his talks with Demirel touched on trade, friendship agreements,  and the formation of a committee on tourism.    A journalist asked Mubarak if there had been progress  concerning the proposal Mubarak made during his visit to Turkey  in February concerning Egyptian-Turkish-Saudi cooperation.  Mubarak answered by saying: Let us begin with Egyptian-Turkish  cooperation. If another country wishes to join us, it is up to  that country to make its wishes known.    Asked whether Turkey can play a role in the Middle East  peace process, President Mubarak said: I would not specify  precisely this role. However, I can frankly say that Turkey is  a strong state in the region and so is Egypt. Turkey is a very  important state in the Middle East.    Asked whether he had discussed with the Turkish president  regional cooperation in fighting terrorism, President Mubarak  said: We discussed this topic. The two countries' foreign  ministers will discuss the kind of cooperation that can exist  between the two countries in this domain, in addition to  discussing the possibility of other countries joining this  cooperation. We will do this quietly in the beginning to see  what this cooperation will produce.    Asked whether he discussed with President Mubarak the  economic embargo imposed on Iraq and its effect on Turkey,  President Demirel said: We discussed this topic but did not go  into detail. As you know, the international community and the  alliance (formed during the Gulf War) are very sensitive about  the Gulf war and Iraq's stand. In my personal opinion, it is  [not further identified] against these sanctions. However, the  international community is not prepared to do anything in this  respect. Demirel said: The sanctions have harmed the Iraqi  people, not just the Iraqi president.    Asked about his concept of cooperation between Egypt and  Turkey to confront terrorism in the region, Demirel said:  Cooperation between Egypt and Turkey is excellent and there are  no problems. What we discussed today and what we will discuss in  the future will be beneficial for the Egyptian and Turkish  peoples.    Commenting on Demirel's remarks, President Mubarak said: We  are anxious to have good cooperation between Egypt and Turkey in  all domains.</p>

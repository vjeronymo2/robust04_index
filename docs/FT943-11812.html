			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Water board nomination raises accountability debate A leading pension fund consultancy is considering backing the nomination of a former water industry regulator to the board of Yorkshire Water. The nomination of Mrs Diana Scott, former chairman of the Yorkshire Water Services Committee, has been opposed by Yorkshire's directors. Pensions and Investment Research Consultants, which advises 16 local authority pension funds with Pounds 18bn in assets, said the nomination raised several important issues about privatised utilities. 'Our clients have become increasingly concerned about their lack of accountability in areas such as disconnections, directors' pay and environmental performance,' said Mr Stuart Bell, research director. Mrs Scott was nominated by a shareholders' resolution which requires the backing of more than 100 investors holding more than Pounds 10,000 in share capital. Mr Bell said such proposals were highly unusual, although increasing. There have been two other such resolutions this year, at Norweb and British Aerospace. See Lex</p>

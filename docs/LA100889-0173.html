			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE OTHER GAMES  </P> <P> GAME OF THE DAY  </P> <P> New York Giants (4-0) at Philadelphia (2-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> It's up to Buddy Ryan's Eagles to prevent an early runaway by the Giants,  already ahead by two games in the NFC East. Philadelphia seemed to be the NFL's  next dominant team and Randall Cunningham the next dominant quarterback until  the Eagles suffered consecutive losses to San Francisco and Chicago. Phil Simms  will try to find the holes others have exploited in the Philadelphia defense,  which ranks last in the NFL. The Giants, trying to go 5-0 for the first time in  48 years, beat the Eagles six consecutive games until Philadelphia won, 24-13  and 23-17, last season.  </P> <P> AFC GAMES  </P> <P> Buffalo (3-1) at Indianapolis (2-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 4.  </P> <P> The Colt defense has not given up a touchdown in the last two games, but was  strafed by Jim Everett and Joe Montana earlier and could be overmatched against  Jim Kelly, who has thrown eight touchdown passes in his last two games. These  teams have split their AFC East series every season since 1984, Buffalo winning  only once in five tries at the Hoosier Dome. Jack Trudeau replaced injured  quarterback Chris Chandler and last week led the Colts past the New York Jets.  Buffalo's defense isn't the same without injured linebacker Shane Conlan.  </P> <P> Cincinnati (3-1) at Pittsburgh (2-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Bengals have beaten Pittsburgh three consecutive times, including a 41-10  rout three weeks ago at Riverfront Stadium, but the Steelers don't figure to be  such a pushover at home after two consecutive victories. Bubby Brister and  Louis Lipps have gotten Pittsburgh rolling after scoring only 10 points in the  first two games. Cincinnati quarterbacks Boomer Esiason and Turk Schonert both  have leg injuries.  </P> <P> Cleveland (3-1) at Miami (1-3), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Bernie Kosar was the toast of Miami during his college days, but it's Dan  Marino's town these days. The Browns can't run the ball -- Kosar was their  leading rusher last week with 33 yards -- but they had enough firepower to hand  Denver its first defeat on Matt Bahr's three field goals. Marino had the worst  game of his career last week, passing for only 103 yards in a 39-7 loss to  Houston. He led the Dolphins to a 38-31 victory over Cleveland last season,  passing for 404 yards and four touchdowns.  </P> <P> San Diego (2-2) at Denver (3-1), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> The Broncos could have taken total control of the AFC West had they held on to  beat Cleveland last week. John Elway hasn't been himself yet but Bobby  Humphrey's running has picked up the Broncos' offense. Jim McMahon has led the  Chargers past Kansas City and Phoenix, but Denver's defense -- No. 1 against  the run at 81 yards a game -- is awfully good. Denver has won five of six from  San Diego.  </P> <P> Houston (2-2) at New England (1-3), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Doug Flutie wasn't the answer last week at Buffalo, but he is 10-0 at Sullivan  Stadium -- 5-0 for Boston College, 5-0 for the Patriots -- so he may get the  nod again over Tony Eason. The Oilers got their running game going last week  with 197 yards -- 97 by Lorenzo White -- against Miami and rolled up 448 total  yards. It may be easier against a New England defense weakened by injuries.  </P> <P> Kansas City (1-3) at Seattle (2-2), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> After two consecutive road victories, the Seahawks return to the Kingdome,  where they have beaten the Chiefs six in a row. Kansas City is 1-14-1 on the  road in the last two years. Dave Krieg riddled the Raider secondary on key  plays last week, but Kansas City's pass defense is No. 2 in the NFL. The Chiefs  have yet to given up 300 yards in a game and rookie linebacker Derrick Thomas  has the look of a star.  </P> <P> NFC GAMES  </P> <P> Chicago (4-0) at Tampa Bay (2-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> Mike Tomczak just gets better and the Bear defense is playing the way it did in  1985, despite giving up 401 yards passing to Philadelphia's Randall Cunningham  -- 246 in a desperation fourth quarter. Chicago has beaten the Buccaneers 12  consecutive times. Vinny Testaverde led Tampa Bay to only a field goal against  Minnesota last week and it doesn't figure to be easier this week with Richard  Dent in top sacking form. Tampa Bay's defense, the only unit in the NFL that  hasn't given up more than 21 points in any game, could keep it close.  </P> <P> San Francisco (3-1) at New Orleans (1-3), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> TV: Channel 2.  </P> <P> The 49ers are back on the road, where they are 3-0 this season and 50-20-1 in  the 1980s -- best in the NFL. San Francisco also is 15-2-1 after losses in  recent seasons. Joe Montana finally got Roger Craig into the offense last week  when the Rams held Jerry Rice to two catches, but the Saints' defense offers  another challenge, especially with linebacker Rickey Jackson back. Dalton  Hilliard has scored a touchdown in five consecutive games for the Saints. The  49ers have won 13 of the last 17 from the Saints, including both last season.  </P> <P> Dallas (0-4) at Green Bay (2-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Packers, after rallying behind Don Majkowski from big deficits in the  second half in the last four weeks, are as close to being 4-0 as they are to  0-4. All four games have been decided by three points or fewer. The Cowboys,  with rookie Steve Walsh replacing injured rookie Troy Aikman at quarterback,  should find the going easier against a Green Bay defense, which has given up  quarterbacks a 71% completion percentage. The Packers lead the NFL in passing  and total offense.  </P> <P> Detroit (0-4) at Minnesota (2-2), 10 a.m.  </P> <P> The Lions haven't won in eight games this season, including exhibitions, and it  doesn't figure to happen this week. Rodney Peete was respectable in his first  start at quarterback last week, but he could have used a healthy Barry Sanders,  who has a hip injury and gained one yard in five carries. The Vikings will go  with Tommy Kramer at quarterback. He led them to last week's victory over Tampa  Bay after Wade Wilson suffered a broken finger.  </P> <P> Phoenix (2-2) at Washington (2-2), 1 p.m.  </P> <P> With the Giants threatening an early breakaway in the NFC East, these teams are  just battling to stay in the race. The Cardinals have lost two in a row after a  surprising 2-0 start, but Gary Hogeboom hopes to find Roy Green and J. T. Smith  running free in the Washington secondary, which ranks 23rd against the pass.  The Redskins are relying on Gerald Riggs and the rushing game with young  quarterback Mark Rypien still tentative at times. Washington has beaten the  Cardinals 10 consecutive times in RFK Stadium.  </P> <P> NOTE: All times PDT. Standings, Page 19.  </P></p>

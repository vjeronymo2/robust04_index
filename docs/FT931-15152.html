			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Outburst exposes rift between Bundesbank and Bonn TENSION within the German economic policymaking establishment unexpectedly burst into the open yesterday when one of the most senior officials in the Bonn finance ministry publicly criticised the Bundesbank for not caring enough about slow growth and rising unemployment. Mr Horst Kohler, the finance ministry state secretary, told a meeting of international officials and bankers that the Bonn government was worried about the capacity of western democracies to live with persistently high unemployment. In an unscripted aside, he then said world growth and high unemployment should be considered more in central bank council meetings. His remarks, clearly aimed at the German central bank's high interest rates, caused an audible intake of breath at yesterday's meeting of the G7 Council, a non-profitmaking body that promotes debate on international finance and trade issues. The finance ministry's impatience with the independent Bundesbank's monetary policy may have reflected different assessments of Germany's growth outlook. Mr Kohler said he 'did not exclude the possibility of negative growth' in Germany this year. By contrast, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said there was 'no reason for dramatising the situation' and forecast increased economic activity from the middle of 1993. Bundesbank officials did not respond directly to Mr Kohler's outburst - that was left to Mr Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch central bank president, who reminded Mr Kohler that by law the Bundesbank was obliged to give a higher priority to attaining price stability than achieving full employment. In separate speeches, both Mr Helmut Schlesinger and Mr Hans Tietmeyer, his deputy, stressed that the Bundesbank could not be blamed for Germany's high interest rates. These were the result of excessively high wage settlements and Germany's inability so far to control its public sector deficits. In their defence, Mr Schlesinger and Mr Tietmeyer pointed out that Germany's long-term interest rates were below their average level for the past 25 years at around 7 per cent. Mr Schlesinger also indicated that the Bundesbank was prepared to operate its monetary policy flexibly, as shown by last week's decision to ease its money market rates to 8.6 per cent. Speaking after gross domestic product figures showed a decline in German economic activity in the second half of 1992, Mr Schlesinger insisted: 'Monetary policy should not be turned into a pacemaker for efforts to kickstart economic activity.' Yesterday's spat between Frankfurt and Bonn contrasted with a mood of harmony among European central bankers. Slowing German growth, Page 2 Observer, Page 19</p>

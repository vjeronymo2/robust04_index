			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NOMINATION FOR CRUELEST-TOWN CROWN  </P> <P> Move over Santa Ana. You no longer hold the crown for the most heartless city  in the Southland.  </P> <P> You earned it fair and square when you initiated the official harassment of the  homeless.  </P> <P> Not only was your intolerance condoned, but your people were apparently proud  of it.  </P> <P> However, you must give the trophy to Santa Barbara. Not only is it bigger and  richer, but it proved its heart is colder and harder than the diamonds worn by  its fine ladies. Its new sleepless law gives it the championship as the city  that most vigorously displays its inhumanity to man.  </P> <P> I hope its citizens will drop a note to their City Council telling them how  proud they are to possess their new title.  </P> <P> ROBERT L. PORTER, Anaheim  </P></p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / First round of MPs' campaign seen as a success MPS YESTERDAY welcomed the first signs of major contributions to help the Maxwell pensioners. While the moves may relieve some of the immediate pressure, the government will face a renewed debate on its own responsibility when the self-critical report by the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation on the affair is published. That report is expected shortly - almost certainly before the next meeting of the 100-strong all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, which is likely to re-assemble in about a month. The report will reinforce the pressure on the government to contribute to longer-term help for the pensioners. Mr Richard Page, the group's Tory co-chairman, said he hoped the moves had 'set the trend we hope others will quickly follow'. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, hailed the reports of the possible contribution as a 'substantial vindication of the effective package' of measures to help the pensioners announced by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, on Monday. The first round of the campaign at Westminster on behalf of the pensioners has been a victory for backbenchers that has left the front benches looking slightly flat-footed. Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, did increase the pressure on the government that began with Monday's lobby of parliament by Maxwell pensioners, by arranging a debate for Tuesday. However, he became a victim of his own success, as Mr Lilley's statement did enough of what the campaign had been seeking to keep the government and its backbenchers on the same side. The adoption of the measures - as urged by the all-party group - seemed more a tribute to the campaign, which held its first meeting less than two months ago, than to Mr Lilley. Even MPs who were publicly grateful said privately that Mr Lilley could have engineered a larger headline figure for the temporary grants. But above all they said that the announcement should have come noticeably before Monday's lobby as it was inevitably seen as a response. With the government's need to ensure the credibility of occupational pension schemes; and a strong report from the cross-party social security committee in the last parliament, the campaign started with good prospects. The Labour co-chairman of the group was Mr Frank Field who led the social security committee in the previous parliament and is widely respected for his knowledge of this area. Mr Page has kept a lower profile, but has shown considerable skill as a Westminster fixer. He contributed to the campaign's success by realistically pitching the first demands at a 'drip feed' of money for the pension schemes and other measures that ministers could bring themselves to accept at a time when writing a taxpayers' cheque for much of the bill was still unthinkable for the government. The campaigning MPs will have to decide whether the unthinkable should become their aim.</p>

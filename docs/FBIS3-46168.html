Such authority would forbid congressional amendments when  considering agreement ratification. The White House was given  this authority during the global trade talks which concluded  last month.    Mickey Kantor, U.S. trade representative, hinted today that  the administration would seek the same authority when, for  example, considering an expansion of the North America Free  Trade Agreement (NAFTA).    "It is critical for negotiators for the U.S. to have fast  track authority if we're going to reach the kind of agreements  that congress has to ratify," Kantor said.    Some countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including  Chile and Argentina, are making efforts to join NAFTA, now the  world's largest free trade zone in terms of territory,  comprising the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.    Speaking at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee,  Kantor said the administration might also seek such authority  when negotiating bilateral investment and intellectual property  rights treaties.</p>

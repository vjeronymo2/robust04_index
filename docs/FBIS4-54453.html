			<p>BFN     [Text] Tirana April 29 (ATA) -- In the April 28 plenary  session of the parliament, the Albanian premier, Aleksander  Meksi, replied to the questions of Arben Imami, independent  deputy, and the groups of DP [Democratic Party] and SP  [Socialist Party] deputies on the price changes in fuel and  electric power.    Meksi pointed out that the decision is taken in relation to  the developments of fire-wood production private sector, the  necessity for the development of private sector in the  production and selling of electric power and avoiding the abuses  in its usage and subsidies as well.    The government aims to secure the supply of population with  these provisions pointed out Meksi saying that in the future,  electric power will meet better the vital demands, as  lightening, cooking but in no way for heating. To achieve this  we have applied the principle of compensation to salaries, in  order to cover the price rise. Admitting that we compensate a  quota of 160 kilowatt hours in a month per family for the whole  year, we compensate the consumed electric power against payment  for 1993 and more than 50 per cent of free of charge consumed  quantity, so more than the needs and possibilities.    The government will improve the legislation, considering the  usage of electric power without payment as a criminal case and  will invest in the improvement of electric apparatus as well as  the eventual privatisation of the sector for the delivering of  electric power.    In the end he said that taking into consideration these  reasons, the government decided that the compensation for a  family should be 700 lek in a month. This will enter in force  in 1995 and will be a permanent part of a monthly salary for the  whole year. Later was approved the law "An Addition to the  Law", "On the City Planning" presented for approval by the  president Sali Berisha.    The law will impede the illegal selling of the construction  sites, sold since January the first 1990. The persons that have  carried out the purchase and the registration in cadastre and  mortgage will be reimbursed the cost of the site according to  the present index of the prices.</p>

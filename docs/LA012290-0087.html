			<p><P> January 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN COURT: A SUMMARY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-RELATED BUSINESS LITIGATION  DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST WEEK.  </P> <P> Mothers of Invention Sue Frank Zappa: Six members of the now-defunct rock  group, the Mothers of Invention, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court on  Thursday against the group's former leader, Frank Zappa; his wife, Gail, and  his companies, Bizarre Records, Barking Pumpkin Records, Barfko Swill and  Intercontinental Absurdities. The suit is related to one filed in 1985 in which  the former members of the band charged that after the group entrusted their  business affairs to Zappa, he obtained the master recordings from another  record company and profited from them without compensating the band members.  </P> <P> In the latest suit, the members add to their claims that Zappa has defamed them  by telling a newspaper that the previous lawsuit was "the product of chemically  altered imaginations." A spokesman for Zappa could not be reached. (Filed Jan.  17, 1990. Case No. C749601)  </P></p>

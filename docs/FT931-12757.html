			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / International Bonds: Finland reopens global offering with Dollars 1bn, five-year deal TWO large offerings yesterday for the Republic of Finland and the Canadian Province of Alberta benefited from strong demand for dollar securities. International investors' appetite for dollar bonds has been sharpened by relatively controlled supply in the Eurobond market and a rally in the US Treasury market. Finland reopened its Dollars 2bn global bond offering launched last November, adding a further Dollars 1bn of five-year bonds. The issue, arranged by Nomura, JP Morgan and Merrill Lynch, is due to be priced today to yield between 63 and 65 basis points more than the five-year Treasury. The outstanding bonds are trading at a 62 basis point yield spread, having tightened substantially from an initial launch spread of 82 basis points, as fears over Finland's credit abated somewhat. Finland, which is rated Aa2 by Moody's and AA by Standard &amp; Poor's, the US ratings agencies, has a borrowing programme close to FM60bn (Dollars 11.3bn) in 1993, which will be split between the international and domestic markets. However, some traders are sceptical about the domestic market's ability to absorb large amounts of debt and expect more than half the country's funding needs to be met in the international market. Alberta launched a Dollars 500m issue of 10-year bonds, arranged by JP Morgan, which were priced to yield 47 basis points more than the comparable US Treasury. The pricing was set at the tight end of the indicated range, reflecting strong demand for the paper. A deal for Empresas ICA, Mexico's largest construction company, also met enthusiastic demand. The issue, arranged by Lehman Brothers, was increased to Dollars 225m, reflecting strong appetite for higher-yielding debt. The bonds were priced to yield 415 basis points over the five-year US Treasury. Bayerische Landesanstalt fur Aufbaufinanzierung (LfA), a Munich-based bank wholly-owned by the Free State of Bavaria, is set to make its debut offering in the Eurobond market, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The Dollars 250m five-year issue, arranged by the Swiss Bank Corporation, is expected to have a coupon of around 6 per cent. The LfA, rated triple-A by Moody's in December 1991, is Bavaria's fifth-largest bank. Its statutory task is to promote trade and industry in Bavaria, and it also finances Bavarian companies' investments in eastern Europe. Last year, it raised DM3.2bn (Dollars 2.1bn), primarily in the German capital markets, but in future it intends to make more use of the Euromarkets. The state of Bavaria is fully liable for the LfA's liabilities.</p>

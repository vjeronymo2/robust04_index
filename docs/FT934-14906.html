			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / A painstaking restoration: Improved industrial competitiveness is crucial for east Germany's economic recovery The government of the east German state of Saxony is carefully restoring the Frauenkirche in Dresden, one of Germany's most beautiful baroque churches, bombed by the British in February 1945 and left in ruins for four decades. Work is expected to last until 2006. Three years after German unification, a similar process of slow restructuring is taking place in the east German economy. The Bundesbank, in its latest monthly report, has recorded the first sign of sustained growth, with manufacturing - hardest hit by the radical upheavals of the last three years - finally showing rising orders and production. But compared with the Frauenkirche, the reconstruction of east Germany is less balanced and less secure. While east Germany started from a much lower base, it has, like west Germany, suffered from the unfavourable global economic environment. Also hitting production has been the rapid introduction of the D-Mark and the collapse of markets elsewhere in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Large-scale transfers from west Germany, totalling around DM180bn (Pounds 73bn) this year, have been needed to make up the gap between what east Germans spend and what they earn. Total east German demand is almost double domestic output as measured by gross domestic product. If east German living standards are to be maintained, funding of this magnitude - amounting to about 5 per cent of west German GDP - will be needed for the next decade or so. At least, though, the east German economy is now growing. In 1992 growth was 7 per cent and is expected to be about the same this year. Particularly important in sustaining that growth has been the buoyancy of the construction industry, even though the rate of increase has slowed recently. A third of 1993's transfers from west Germany will be channelled into infrastructure projects. The impact is obvious in the improved quality of roads, the water network and telecommunications. Also showing fast growth in the last three years have been family-based workshops, representatives of the Handwerk craft enterprises which are common in west Germany. Economic liberalisation created both a demand and supply of small-scale businesses and 870,000 such enterprises have been set up since unification. The Association for German Craftsmen, which represents these businesses, believes they contribute about 7 per cent of east Germany's total output - but, because of difficulties in measuring their contribution to GDP, official growth figures probably underestimate their impact. Yet the buoyancy of construction, services and small businesses is not enough to propel eastern Germany towards a self-sustained recovery. If east Germany is to become economically competitive - within Germany or abroad - the future of the manufacturing and industrial sectors will be critical. Large swathes of eastern Germany's under-capitalised manufacturing sector, which, before unification, contributed about 70 per cent of the region's GDP, have been forced to close because they were uncompetitive. There were two main reasons. First, monetary union led to a rapid escalation of both costs for manufacturers and output prices. Second, the demise of Comecon, the socialist trade bloc, deprived eastern Germany of markets which before 1990 had accounted for more than 75 per cent of eastern Germany's exports. Since unification, the Treuhand agency, charged with privatising and restructuring east German industry, has embarked on a radical programme. Of the 13,000 enterprises under its control, more than 10,000 have been sold, 2,500 closed, and 500 are being prepared for privatisation. But the performance of the newly privatised sector has been disappointing. Mr Heiner Flassbeck, chief economist at the Berlin-based German DIW Institute for Economic Research, says a typical enterprise is making losses equivalent to about 30 per cent of annual turnover. The main brake has been high wage levels. In March 1991 IG Metall, the engineering trade union, together with former east German managers and west German employers, agreed that wages in eastern Germany should reach west German levels by 1994. But rising wages have stifled competitiveness. Subsequently, the deadline has been extended to 1996. Mr Thomas Mayer, chief economist at the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs, the securities house, says the agreement has held back much-needed efficiency gains. He estimates productivity in eastern German industry is about 65 per cent below western German levels, while wages in the east are about 70 to 80 per cent of those in the west. That makes unit labour costs about 70 per cent higher. 'This has had a debilitating effect on managers. They have little room to manoeuvre,' he says. But Mrs Birgit Breuel, head of the Treuhand, says high wage levels are not the sole reason that east Germany's economy has not yet become self-sustaining. She believes that its manufacturing companies need pump priming in the form of investment and orders from west Germany and elsewhere. 'The companies for which we are responsible have really improved their quality. What they need is orders. At the moment they get the orders, they increase their productivity immensely. But the (level of) orders they receive is linked to the recession in western Germany.' Despite the recession, the level of investment by western German companies has been holding up, partly because such strategic decisions are taken years in advance. But forecasts for next year are less optimistic. The Munich-based Ifo Economic Forecasting Institute expects investment in manufacturing in eastern Germany to rise by 15 per cent this year, but forecasts a one-fifth decline in west German industry's investment in the east's machinery and equipment next year. Many economists believe that if east Germany is to attract sufficient future investment, the region's current high level of federal grants for investment and tax benefits will have to be maintained - and possibly wage restraint introduced. According to the DIW, this year's federal subsidies to eastern Germany, including grants, tax concessions, soft loans and subsidies by the Treuhand, total DM50bn, or about 20 per cent of the region's GDP. These are in addition to the federal transfers, which go direct to governments of the eastern states. Discontinuing such a high level of subsidy could hit companies in the west as well as the east. Mrs Breuel says: 'If they (west Germans) do not give orders to eastern German companies, the transfers will have to go on for a long time. And they will have to be paid for by taxes.' Adding to the burden on west Germany would be continuing high unemployment. Before 1990, 92 per cent of the eastern German workforce was employed. Today 15 per cent of the 7.5m strong labour force is jobless. Taking account of job creation schemes and short-time working, the real unemployment level is at least 35 per cent. Though high unemployment reinforces arguments for wage flexibility, the adverse effect that breaking the link with west German wages would have on living standards means the German government is looking more towards continuing the subsidies and transfers in the hope of stimulating orders. The fear of some economists is that eastern Germany might become a 'Mezzogiorno', a part of southern Italy that is heavily dependent on transfers from the prosperous north. Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the prime minister of Saxony, disagrees. 'The whole comparison with a Mezzogiorno is absolute nonsense. We are reconstructing an economy (in Saxony) that had the highest GDP per capita in all of Europe immediately after 1918. It has a 200-year history of industrialisation. A Mezzogiorno never had a combination of culture and industry.' Despite Mr Biedenkopf's bold statements, there seems little likelihood of a significant cut in transfers and subsidies from west to east in the next decade. The growth that has taken root in some sectors will have to be maintained and perhaps accelerated if reconstruction leading to a self-sustaining economy is to keep pace with the rebuilding of Dresden's Frauenkirche.</p>

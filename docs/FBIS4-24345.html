			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jose Manuel Pio in Chimoio] </F>   [Text] Mozambique National Resistance [Renamo] leader  Afonso Dhlakama yesterday once again accused the Mozambique  Liberation Front [Frelimo] government of infiltrating troops  into the Police of the Republic of Mozambique. Dhlakama said  that Frelimo is carrying out efforts to bolster the capacity of  militiamen and the Rapid Intervention Police. Speaking to  journalists on his arrival in Chimoio yesterday, President  Joaquim Chissano said Frelimo is not bothered about the training  of the new nonpartisan Mozambican army. He said this is  evidenced by the failure to create the necessary conditions in  the training centers.    [Begin Dhlakama recording] That is normal. That is normal.  The Mozambican Government is not giving emphasis to this very  important process. As you are aware, the barracks, the training  camps have not been rehabilitated. The process is very much  behind schedule. Instead of giving emphasis to the training of a  nonpartisan national army, Frelimo is carrying out efforts to  bolster the capacity of militiamen and the Rapid Intervention  Police. It is infiltrating troops into the Mozambican police.  This is a lamentable situation. All the same, I believe that we  will be able to exercise our influence. [end recording]    The Renamo leader said the demobilization process is  currently experiencing difficulties because the government is  not interested in seeing things move smoothly in order to  boycott the elections scheduled for October this year.  [sentence as heard]    Meanwhile, today, the second day of his visit to Manica  Province, President Afonso Dhlakama will carry out internal work  with his party members, and this evening he will have a meeting  with businessmen in the province.    According to his working program, he will leave tomorrow for  Gondola District, and he will then visit the Manica Provincial  Hospital and some companies in Chimoio. He will also hold a  meeting with his party's technical cadres stationed here in  Manica.    Yesterday the Renamo leader was honored with a friendly  dinner on the occasion of his visit to Manica Province.</p>

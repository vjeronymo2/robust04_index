De Greiff was referring to  San Gil Bishop Monsignor Leonardo Gomez' admission to having  held such meetings.    In statements to the Colmundo Radio Network, the official  said: "I think it is regrettable that a bishop has become a  mailbox for subversives."    The prelate said on 24 February that he met "with the FARC  [Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia] 23d Front." He also  said this guerrilla organization "did not perpetrate some crimes  attributed to it in Velez Province; paramilitary groups did."    De Greiff responded to those statements. When asked about  the legal repercussions for such actions, he said that "one  characteristic of the state of law is that no one is above the  law, not even the most dignified person. No one can feel free  to dictate his own behavioral guidelines."    De Greiff added: "If the law that Colombians have approved  forbids talking with subversives, then everybody must obey it:  the president of the Republic, the bishops, and even the most  humble Colombian."    Two months ago, on 17 January, Santander authorities blamed  the 23d Front for perpetrating a bloody and vicious attack on  the Florian community that left five policemen dead.    On August 1993, the National Committee of Victims of the  Guerrillas [Comite Nacional de Victimas de la Guerrilla] (Vida),  headed by lawyer Fernando Vargas, personally filed charges  against Bishop Gomez at the Prosecutor General's Office for  allegedly being an accomplice to and aiding and abetting the  subversives.</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Weak output points to prolonged recession WEAK INDUSTRIAL output figures released yesterday raised fears that Britain was heading for its longest recession since the Second World War. Manufacturing output fell by 1.2 per cent in the three months to November compared with the previous three months. This points towards flat or negative output, excluding oil and gas, in the fourth quarter of 1991 - the sixth successive quarterly decline of such output. More bleak news came from a survey by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce. It reported a decline in business confidence in the final quarter of last year and said recovery was likely to be postponed from the second to the third quarter of this year. Factors holding back an upturn included low levels of manufacturing investment and the prospect of further rises in unemployment, which would damage consumer confidence. The signs are that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will present his second Budget on March 10 against the background of depressed activity in the economy. Provisional figures for fourth-quarter gross domestic product will be released on February 20. These are now expected to show that the economy resumed its downward path towards the end of last year after a minimal recovery in the third quarter on the strength of increased North Sea oil output. This would mean that the recession had run for six quarters compared with five quarters for the previous longest post-war recession which lasted from the end of 1979 to spring 1981. According to figures from the Central Statistical Office, manufacturing output in November rose 0.1 per cent compared with October, but remained 4 per cent down on the year. The index for November stood at 111.2 compared with a peak of 120.5 in the second quarter of 1990. Energy output, mostly North Sea oil production, fell by 2.4 per cent on the month, but was 0.9 per cent up in the three months to November compared with the June to August figure. The Treasury said the figures confirmed that economic activity had been flat since the middle of 1991. 'It is too early to say what the fourth quarter will be, but it is clearly not going to be the 1.5 per cent growth predicted in the Autumn Statement,' said the Treasury. The weakest area in manufacturing continued to be engineering. Output fell by 2.6 per cent in the three months to November compared with the previous three and stood 7.1 per cent down on the year. Output of metals, minerals, investment goods, food, textiles, clothing and aerospace products fell. Only output in the chemicals sector continued to rise, registering a 2.3 per cent increase in the three months to November compared with the three months to August. There was some comfort for the government on inflation prospects with a slowdown in the growth of manufacturers' unit wage costs. Wage costs in the three months to November rose 5 per cent compared with the same period a year ago and by 1.7 per cent compared with the previous three months. In the third quarter of 1991 they rose by 0.9 per cent compared with a rise of 7 per cent in the same quarter of 1990. Businesses expect delay in recovery, Page 7</p>

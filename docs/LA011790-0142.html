			<p><P> January 17, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> DRUMMERS RESIGN OVER BAD RAP  </P> <P> The Rhode Island Philharmonic's entire percussion section quit after its leader  was told he would be fired unless his playing improved.  </P> <P> George Goneconto, a 33-year veteran of the orchestra, said Tuesday he resigned  rather than fight a notice putting him on probation.  </P> <P> His decision led to the resignations last month of the three other percussion  members, all former students of the drummer.  </P> <P> Conductor Andrew Massey, who sent warning letters to eight members of the  orchestra at the end of November, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Goneconto said he and Massey had a "friendly discussion" about his performance  in the fall, and he received the letter soon afterward, which he called a  "complete shock."  </P> <P> Under the orchestra's contract with the Providence Federation of Musicians,  players who receive warning letters have until the end of the season to  improve. They can appeal to a panel of fellow orchestra members, who can  overrule Massey.  </P> <P> Goneconto, 53, joined the Philharmonic when he was 18 and has been the  principal percussionist for 30 years.  </P></p>

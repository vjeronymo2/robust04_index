			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / UK Company News: CapCo's Nottingham shopping centre deal CAPITAL &amp; Counties yesterday said it had exchanged its 48.5 per cent stake in Victoria Centre, Nottingham, for Pounds 34.7m cash and a 20 per cent stake in a new partnership formed to own the freehold of the centre, writes Richard Gourlay. The new partnership includes the ICI Pension Fund, the previous joint owners of the centre, and institutional investors. It was brought together by Dusco UK, a vehicle of Mr Dick Dusseldorp, founder of Lend Lease Corp, the Australian property company. Capital &amp; Counties will remain the manager of the Victoria Centre which it developed in 1972. The cash injection will further reduce the group's debt which fell to about Pounds 400m last August following a Pounds 102m rights issue. Capital &amp; Counties is 82 per cent owned by the South African-controlled TransAtlantic Holdings.</p>

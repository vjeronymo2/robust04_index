			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Non-recurring costs put Starmin loss at Pounds 1.24m STARMIN, the quarry products company chaired by Lord Parkinson, the former Conservative cabinet minister, announced interim pre-tax losses deepening from Pounds 479,000 to Pounds 1.24m in the six months to June 30. Mr Owen Rout, the acting chief executive, said the company had not so far received notification of legal action by either Mr Raschid Abdullah, a non-executive director who speaks for about 30 per cent of Starmin's equity, or his brother Osman. Mr Osman Abdullah said he had not reached a decision. His brother was not available for comment. Turnover fell to Pounds 8.59m (Pounds 10.8m) as the company continued its programme of disposals of non-core businesses to bring down debt. This is the first set of results since a review of accounting policies prompted the company to restate 1992 pre-tax losses from Pounds 8.06m to Pounds 11.9m in 1992. The restatement was prompted by a review of accounting policies focused on asset swaps paid for with shares in a privately held company. On acquisitions, Mr Rout said: 'A number of talks are going on. Any option we would look at. But we must be satisfied any deal is in the best interests of shareholders.' He said he would continue as acting chief executive for the time being: 'There is no point going out and looking for a new chief executive if we then conclude a deal which makes his appointment unnecessary.' Operating losses were Pounds 507,000 (Pounds 325,000), which disguised a Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 1.16m) operating profit on continuing operations, before exceptional costs, the company said. There were exceptional costs of Pounds 388,000 (Pounds 1.57m), of which Pounds 250,000 covered the reorganisation and board review while Pounds 138,000 covered abortive acquisition costs. Interest charges rose to Pounds 352,000 (Pounds 267,000) and net debt at the half year end was Pounds 8.12m for gearing of 44.6 per cent. Losses per share were 0.4p (0.3p) and the board did not declare a dividend. It paid 0.1p last time.</p>

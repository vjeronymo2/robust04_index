Latest statistics show that the city withdrew 3.35 billion  yuan of currency from circulation last year, ranking second  after Guangzhou, leaving behind the three centrally controlled  municipalities of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.    Tang Shuangning, vice president of the Shenyang branch of  the  People's Bank China, said that the city's currency withdrawal  from circulation has maintained an annual rate of 40 percent  since 1990.    The net currency withdrawal means that during a given period  of time, the amount of money put into circulation is smaller  than the amount of money withdrawn. The chief means to withdraw  money from circulation include retail sales, bank savings and  recovery of agricultural debts, offering of services, property  taxation and trading taxation at markets. Under the current  economic system, it is regarded as a key indicator of the  development of commerce, finance, communications and information.    This shows that Shenyang city is well on its way from an  industrial city into a city with a developed commerce, finance  and services.</p>

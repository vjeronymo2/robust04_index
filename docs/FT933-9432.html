			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Letter: Local efforts too often ignored in delivery of emergency aid Sir, Edward Mortimer's review of Jonathan Benthall's book, Disasters, Belief and the Media (August 6), describes a list of familiar characters who appear on the scene during news coverage of emergencies overseas. Among 'the hero, the villain, the dispatcher and the donor' was a striking omission: the local people. Local relief workers are almost always the greatest contributors to the provision of emergency relief. The resources may have to come from outside (though not always) but those who deliver them on the ground - who drive the convoys, run the feeding centres, staff the refugee camps and provide health care - are usually national staff from the country concerned. Even in Somalia, where national structures have collapsed, relief programmes have been crucially dependent on brave, committed, qualified Somali staff. Unfortunately, even the best of the Western media tend to be blind to these efforts. The 'media construct' described by Mr Benthall is a template applied without discernment by reporters and editors who 'know' what the public will identify with - the 'hero' (or, equally, the 'heroine'), a white Western aid worker replete with agency T-shirt, looking caring and concerned against the background of starving children or miserable refugees. The overall impression created is one of helplessness and pathetic dependence among the local people, contrasted with the active, even 'flamboyant' generosity of Westerners. This can be damaging, not just for the image of the Third World and its people which the public receives, but also for its direct consequences for the relief and rehabilitation programmes. It encourages a type of aid delivery which donor governments, anxious to be seen to act swiftly, are increasingly anxious to fund. This is to parachute Western workers, materials and delivery structures into a foreign country, ignoring not only the local context but also the local capacity for meeting the crisis. National professional people, many of them highly trained and qualified, find they have no influence over an expenditure of massive resources from outside which may be inappropriately targeted. When the international agencies depart (not coincidentally, soon after the last of the TV cameras) nothing will have been done to strengthen the ability of the local people to go on meeting the needs of a disaster which may have repercussions lasting many years. The journalists who cover these situations are compassionate men and women whose reporting is frequently motivated by humanitarianism. But their hope that by reporting a need they will produce the right kind of action is often too simplistically applied. The style and content of the reporting will influence the style and content of the response. It is time for creative journalists - and, more importantly, their editors - to break the disaster-reporting mould and think again.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Settlement of disciplinary actions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Exchange's Enforcement Department is charged with the responsibility of issuing disciplinary charges if, following an investigation, it is determined that persons or entities within the Exchange's jurisdiction committed serious infractions of the exchange's rules or the Federal securities laws. The issuance of formal charges begins a rather lengthy process involving the filing of an answer to the charges, the exchange of documents, and the scheduling of a disciplinary hearing. Very often, however, persons who are the subject of Exchange investigations wish to settle the matter before formal charges are issued by stipulating to certain facts and consenting to a penalty. At present, Article V, section 1(b)(4) of the Constitution and Rule 345(c) require the issuance of formal charges before a disciplinary matter can be settled. In contrast, the comparable rules at the NYSE, NASD, and CBOE permit potential respondents to settle disciplinary proceedings without the service of formal charges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is proposed that the Exchange conform its procedures for settling disciplinary actions to those now in effect at all the other major self-regulatory organizations. There would be several advantages to amending the procedures in the manner proposed. First, it would save the substantial time and expense that is now devoted to the formal charging process in settled cases. Second, it would give the Exchange more flexibility in negotiating the resolution of enforcement actions. Third, conforming the Exchange's settlement procedures to those in place at the other principal self-regulatory organizations would serve the interests of regulatory uniformity and simplicity. Finally, potential respondents would still retain the option of following the current disciplinary procedures if they are so inclined. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Statutory Basis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change is consistent with section 6(b) of the Act in general and furthers the objectives of section 6(b)(6) in particular in that it is intended to assure that members, member firms, and member firm employees are disciplined for rule violations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Yu. Chaplygin, candidate of economic sciences: </F> "On the Way to a Unified Economic Space?"]    [Text] The Moscow Meeting of the Leaders of the CIS  States marked another frontier in the transformation of  post-Soviet space. The frontier is more an economic one and  marks the starting point for practical steps in compatible  market transformations of the national economies and their  integration in stages.  <H5>  Imbalance of Interests </H5>   During the time of the USSR, the mutual ties of the present  participants in the Commonwealth accounted for at least 20  percent of the aggregate gross national product. About  three-quarters of the economic interests of the Union republics  were oriented to Russia and roughly one-third of Russian needs  for output of ferrous and nonferrous metallurgy, chemistry,  machinebuilding, and light industry was in their hands. For  certain types of raw materials, rare earth elements, and  components, Russia even now is 70-100 percent dependent on  supplies from the CIS. According to some estimates, the  disintegration of economic ties in 1992-1993 accounted for from  30 to 60 percent of the lost gross national product of the  Commonwealth countries.    The awareness of objective interdependence is coming through  the breakdown of the euphoria of sovereignty, the collapse of  unrealizable hopes for the satisfying and warm embraces of the  West and rich "spiritual-historical" relatives, and a sharper  sense of the catastrophe of economic isolation. It is calculated  that each percentage point of reduction or, in contrast,  expansion of mutual deliveries impoverishes or enriches the  partners in the CIS by between 4 percent (Russia) and 10 percent  (Turkmenistan) of gross national product. But the complete  disruption of economic ties in the Commonwealth threatens Russia  with a one-third reduction in final consumption, and the other  participants in it--with a decline to scarcely one-sixth the  former level.    On the other hand, the impossibility and in fact uselessness  of at any price preserving economic ties in the form in which  they developed under the all-Union distribution of labor and  cooperation is recognized no less clearly. An approach  consisting of at least three forces of influence has clearly  taken shape. First, the attempt to identify those  production-technological links which--if they are not mutually  coordinated--make it impossible to overcome the economic crisis,  achieve stabilization, and develop in the future. Second, the  aspiration for the kind of structural reorganization of  production which ensures economic security and independence  (oil, electricity production, and food) by relying on one's own  efforts. Third, with the support of the CIS countries to create  favorable conditions for increasing export potential, for  attracting investments preferably from the far abroad, and for  making breakthroughs to contemporary technologies and to new  sales markets.    Under these approaches, national-state interests inevitably  become paramount. Russia is attempting to overcome the donor  attitude toward itself, establish equivalent exchange, and  protect its current and long-term geopolitical and economic  interests. This pertains especially to the effectiveness of  deliveries to the Commonwealth countries of fuel and energy  resources, preservation of traditional sales markets, and access  to unique sources of strategic raw materials and the transport  infrastructure. The Russian partners obviously are interested in  cheap energy media, equipment, and consumer goods, sales markets  for their output, and credit resources, and figuring on  "fraternal aid."    Achieving parity of interests and balancing them is for now  difficult to do. A more down-to-earth calculation predominates:  who wins and who loses, and how much, based on prices, customs  tariffs, conditions of settlement of accounts, and volumes of  interrelated deliveries.    A "double standard" seems to arise: easy and complete accord  at the higher levels in terms of general conceptual approaches  and for multilateral reintegration understandings, and  difficult, exhausting bargaining on specific bilateral  agreements. The former remain on paper and the latter are as a  rule not fully executed. Trade-economic cooperation is being cut  back. Last year the total volume of commodity turnover between  Russia and other Commonwealth countries was almost 44 percent  less than in 1991, while this year the volume of mutual  deliveries of the major commodities will decline by another  30-40 percent.    Of course, critical drops in production, lower effective  demand, and nonpayments because of uncoordinated breakthroughs  to world prices for the basic raw material and fuel-energy  resources have an effect. The increasing imbalance of interests,  mutual economic distancing, and the search for more profitable  alternatives on world markets play no less a role. But as a  result, integration processes are impeded, their effect is  reduced, and the new values of a unified economic space cannot  be fully manifested.  <H5>  Toward a Market System of Coordinates </H5>   Today the logic of the integration movements in the  Commonwealth dictates a different unifying formula--a common  market space. Here there is no longer the need for structural  correlation of the production-technological chains, strict  cooperation relationships, or national-state economic complexes.  Even if the system of specialization and coordination of  production is preserved, the interdependence of technologies,  supply lines, standards, and markets gives economic relations  among the elements of this system a different market mobility  and adaptability. The integration paradigms adopted by all the  Commonwealth countries are more easily and intelligibly  organized; those paradigms are equitable and mutually  advantageous cooperation without violating the status quo in the  political sphere and nonintervention in national-state  development and without flagrant impact on national economic  interests.    The change to a system of coordinates of a common market  space is facilitated by a factor which is fundamentally new to  the former socialist republics and perhaps in world  practice--the emergence of insolvent demand and artificial  overproduction... in conditions of a commodity shortage. The  collapse of the unified currency space, the introduction of  national currencies which are not interrelated, and the  one-sided monetaristic policy destroyed the old mechanisms of  mutual settlement of accounts and sharply constricted the  already weak effective demand of enterprises and the population.  Commodity producers and commodity consumers proved to be equally  insolvent and bankrupt. The resource shortage overlapped with  the money shortage. The avalanche of nonpayments also paralyzed  what was left of the unified economic complex and destroyed the  unified economic space for good.    The spontaneous jumps to world prices for raw materials and  fuel and energy resources played a special role. The  inconceivable burst of cost inflation put the producers of final  output in a most foolish position: prices for their items was on  the world level while quality was on the local level. Naturally,  the consumer turned to markets of third countries where there is  at least some selection and where they can buy things that are a  little better and a little less expensive.  <H5>  Pragmatism: A Cautious Gamble </H5>   One certainly cannot say that these processes are not  followed, noted, or comprehended in the management structures of  the Commonwealth countries. On the contrary, they are perceived  very acutely and conclusions which are at times decisive, rigid,  and unequivocal are drawn.    The first and most apparent is that the search for market  forms of cooperation which are fundamentally new to everyone is  being stepped up. Above all for those which reduce or compensate  for inflationary growth in production costs and help restore  production and set up clarified payment-account settlement  channels and more realistic mechanisms of mutual coordination.  Actions in these directions are marked by their apparent  restraint from abrupt, "shock" movements and cavalier ways, by  their practicality, and by coordinated transition from the  simple to the complex which carries real integration meaning.    On this level, the Moscow Meeting of Leaders of the  Commonwealth States can be classified among the most productive.  And the point is not only the 20 agreements and protocols on  economic topics signed. The very fact of the translation of  general talks into the pragmatic language of legal formulas  which particular economic actions should now be subjected to is  important. How realistic is this?    In terms of the schedule of realization, the closest is the  start of work by the Interstate Bank for Economic Cooperation.  Four months have passed since the day the agreement was  concluded, but there have been no energetic actions--the bank  cannot act until the founders make their contributions to the  capital stock. And its main task is to organize interstate  settlement of accounts within the CIS and be the center of the  Payments Union and its specialized banking institution.    The causes of this situation are by no means the traditional  disorganization or miserliness. They are deeper--the vagueness  of mechanisms of currency-monetary settlement of accounts and  mutual convertibility of the national currencies. For now there  are more questions than answers. Only general provisions are  fixed in the concept of the Payments Union:     -  the right of participants in trade transactions to  independently choose the forms of accounts settlements, the  currency of the contract price, and the currency of the payment;    -  mutual recognition of national currencies and the  unrestricted  right to use them as a means of payment;    -  the possibility of introducing a collective use currency for  interstate settlement of accounts;    -  the sovereignty of the participating states in defining the  system of convertibility of national currencies into foreign  currencies for transactions involving the movement of goods and  services;    -  setting of exchange rates of national currencies on the basis  of supply and demand on the currency exchanges or according to  the interbank currency market and the obligation to be  restricted to a single currency rate for all types of foreign  economic operations.        It seems that the Commonwealth has a chance to successfully  survive the consequences of the collapse of the unified  currency-monetary system of the USSR, the failure of the "new  type of ruble zone" to materialize, and the introduction of weak  and essentially surrogate national currencies. Even a general  conceptual approach to bringing order here, if not the "light at  the end of the tunnel," is at least a flicker in the present  currency absurdities of normalization of trade relations in  which the old donor-distributor customs and the new economic  interests tinged with national colors have become intricately  intertwined.    There is almost nothing to compare it with: the trade  "divorce" was not realized and life together continues, although  now in different apartments. Russia's new foreign economic  partners require more of Russia than they are prepared and able  to share themselves. For example, everyone amicably desires that  customs duties and restrictions on exporting Russian goods be  abolished right now; however, they do not want to make counter  movements but augment the barriers against their exports to  Russia and in every way possible facilitate those exports' way  to third countries. And that includes by unsanctioned reexport  of Russian goods.    The mechanism of interests is a simple one: take a few more  goods in Russia, for the most part energy media, at domestic  prices which are still lower than world prices, and deliver  slightly fewer of their own goods and at the level of world  prices or even higher. Incidentally, that is how it was in CEMA.  But all we had to do, at Czechoslovakia's initiative, was change  over to world prices and settlement of accounts in freely  convertible currency and the production-economic ties which had  developed over the decades and with them all trade crashed down  in one hour.    Something like that is happening among the Commonwealth  participants too. Last year under Goskontrakt [State Contract]  alone, Russian exports exceeded imports by more than 400 million  dollars. According to the contracts, the opposite balance was  expected--imports should have exceeded exports by 500 million  dollars. In a normal economy, a positive trade balance is an  achievement. But for us it is nothing but losses: deliveries of  batches at near world prices were paid for largely through  Russian state credits. The debts on them by the start of 1994  exceeded 3 trillion rubles [R], although a year before they were  just R1.3 billion. If in addition Russia unilaterally abolished  export duties, there would be roughly 4 billion dollars less in  the federal budget.    Without parity in trade-customs policy, there is no free  trade and there cannot be. Converting to it means in a  coordinated way and in stages bringing customs regimes closer,  narrowing nontariff restrictions, and ensuring strict discipline  in executing contracts.    But for now, without reciprocity Russia has again  magnanimously and recklessly moved along the path of improper  liberalization of foreign trade. The number of goods under quota  this year declined from 108 to 38 items. The overall quota of  deliveries to the Commonwealth states is dropping substantially.  Export duties on goods whose domestic prices have approached  world prices are to be lowered. And enterprises and regions and  private trade and intermediary firms receive priority in foreign  trade.    There is unlikely to be an equivalent response from partners  to these measures. This year Russia will receive fewer ferrous  and nonferrous metals, steel pipe, cotton fiber, synthetic  threads, and food, while its partners in the CIS Economic Union  will receive fewer energy media and chemical and  petroleum-chemical output. It seems that the sphere of mutual  trade is narrowing like pebbled leather.    Everyone sees the fundamental solutions to trade-economic  problems, both old and newly acquired ones, in creating  civilized conditions for free trade realistic for a market and  based on the Customs Union. Of course, the way to this is long  and difficult--through a free trade zone, by-stage agreements,  and complete development of customs rules and tariff and  nontariff restrictions. The participants in the Economic Union  decided to join this path on 15 April 1994. Of course, a free  trade zone is not yet integration, but all the same it is a  half-open door to the passage to a common market space regulated  not by the will of the strong but on an equal basis with due  regard for mutual interests.  <H5>  Center-phobia: Remembrance of the Past, Fear for the Future </H5>   Overall the problem of regulating integration processes and  managing them still sounds incomprehensible, if not to say  foolish. And the reasons for this are the persistent allergy to  the supranational organs of the Economic Union.    A plan for an Interstate Economic Committee with very broad  functions was prepared for the Moscow Meeting at Kazakhstan's  initiative. Essentially this meant the formation of a  supranational administrative core with the authority to make  decisions mandatory for fulfillment. But centrifugal force,  remembrance of the past, and fears for the future won out, and  it was confined to a commission of professional experts under  the CIS Coordinating-Consultative Committee. A decisive  integration step was postponed for later.    Nonetheless, the creation of an Economic Union commission  must be classified as yet another achievement of the sincere  advocates of economic integration. Regardless of where, fairly  powerful intellectual potential can be concentrated in one  place. The important thing is that not occasionally but on a  regular basis there is the possibility--on a sensible and  balanced basis--to formulate recommendations on production  specialization and cooperation, coordinated measures in the most  important interstate spheres (transport, communications, energy  supply, ecology, and elimination of the consequences of  emergency situations), and joint scientific-technical research.  Perhaps the most promising function of the commission is to  formulate proposals on coordinating interstate organs of  sectorial cooperation and economic structures of the future  common market--transnational corporations, financial-industrial  groups, banking consortiums, and joint ventures.    If the new commission does not fall into routine work on  preparing draft agreements of every type but holds out as the  "brain center," the general problems of economic integration  will be untangled and its mechanisms worked up, and they will be  interlinked more rapidly and systematically. Only then can the  Economic Union be given concrete meaning and be turned into  reality.  <H5>  New Turns Toward Integration </H5>   But for now internal moves are maturing in the Commonwealth;  their sources are in the area of political ambitions and  business calculations, distrust of the need for and possibility  of reintegration of the CIS participants, and mutual  dissatisfaction and suspicion. The undiplomatic injection of  fear of Russia's "special role and responsibility" in  post-Soviet space is feeding all this. One example of these  moves that put one on guard is the emergence of a trend toward  regional political-economic integration.    Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus awakened the impulse. Last  summer they declared a Slavic Union. There was in truth little  of a union or common ground behind this announcement, as life  showed. It was rather a political declaration, but it stimulated  processes which were not fully envisioned when its participants  formed the CIS and the Economic Union.    Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan were the first to respond and  announced the creation of a "unified economic space," but  essentially began to put together a Central Asian free trade  association along with Kirghizia, which joined them. The  specifics of this step were for the time being confined to  eliminating customs borders. But we must expect more radical  actions along the lines of N. Nazarbayev's idea of a Eurasian  Economic Union. In any case, these three Central Asian states,  it seems, are politically prepared to move toward one another,  possibly even to the point of forming a regional "common market"  and even a confederation.    On 12 April, after tough, mercenary disputes, Russia and  Belarus finally announced the actual creation of a  Russian-Belarusian "common market" with their monetary systems  unified. But the entire procedure was planned as an action in  stages, with an eye to its political consequences and economic  results.    It was difficult, but a model of post-Union economic  integration close to reality in fact emerged. Even though it is  inferior, politicized, and controversial with a hypertrophied  role of Russian economic departments. And if it comes about,  with the exception of aspects which create a "Moscow center"  syndrome, it will be perfectly acceptable to the rest. Even to  those for whom unification is not yet a synonym for unity. In  any case, a political testing ground has appeared for breaking  in the idea of a Eurasian Confederation, which practical  politicians repeat with unceasing persistence.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Since the beginning of the war in Rwanda  following the death of the Rwandan president, a number of  Rwandans have been fleeing to Burundi while Burundians who had  taken refuge in Rwanda are returning in great numbers. Today,  our colleague Emmanuel Ngendanzi asked the governor of Ngozi,  Mr. Joseph Ntakirutimana, who informed him of the situation  there.    [Begin Ntakirutimana recording] We have welcomed Burundians  who fled on many occasions. The first groups came through [word  indistinct] commune, [word indistinct]. They numbered about  6,000. We sent them to the Kirundo governor. I would like to  take the opportunity to thank the Army headquarters which sent  us 12 lorries in addition to the UNHCR vehicles which assisted  us to transport them to the place. Today, they transported the  last 1,000 people to Kirundo. Now there are returnees from  Mwumba Commune. Yesterday they numbered some 5,966 people.    We also welcome fleeing Rwandans. In (Gatsinda), Mwumba  Commune, we had received around 70 people up to yesterday. Most  of them are men. In Busiga, we also received 70 Rwandans. Most  of them are men. [Words indistinct] government employees. There  are also Burundian returnees from other communes. For example  the returnees from Kiremba Commune did not go to a refugee camp  such as in Busiga. They number about 1,000 people who went  straight to their homes. In Marangara Commune, about 3,000  people also returned to their homes from Rwanda. [passage  omitted]    Kirundo Province also continues to receive the refugees who  fled last year to Rwanda, without forgetting Rwandans who are  fleeing the war currently under way in the country following the  death of the country's president this April. Up to 10 April,  these Rwandan refugees numbered 1,700. Most of them are in  Busoni Commune. Others are in Bugabira Commune. The number of  Burundian returnees is slightly above 22,500. Most of them  originate from Busoni and Bugabira communes, and there are  others from Ntega and Kirundo communes. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

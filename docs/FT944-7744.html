			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Anglo Irish Bank turns in 57% advance to IPounds 14.5m Anglo Irish Bank Corporation, which is listed on the Dublin stock exchange, reported a 57 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to IPounds 14.5m (Pounds 14.3m) for the year to September 30, despite sluggish loan demand in the first half. The bank's UK operation reported a return to profit with IPounds 1.3m compared with a loss in 1993 of IPounds 333,000. The bank, with its core lending to small and medium sized business, increased earnings per of share from the 1993 level of 4.98p, as adjusted for a rights issue, to 5.02p. The rise was achieved despite additional personnel costs as the company expanded its UK managerial staff and a share capital increase following the rights issue in January. Net interest income was slightly ahead at IPounds 27.9m (IPounds 26.8m). Fee income more than doubled to IPounds 5.38m (IPounds 2.1m). Treasury profits were also substantially ahead at IPounds 3.1m. However, overheads were also higher, at IPounds 13.6m (IPounds 12.4m). .There were bad debt write-offs of IPounds 6m. Non performing loans stood at IPounds 30m. The bank maintains a conservative policy, with 86 per cent of non performing loans provisioned for. The deposit base improved, with deposits up 23 per cent to IPounds 1.18m. The bulk of new deposits came from smaller retail customers. The bank reported slack loan demand in the first nine months, but a marked improvement in the last quarter, which has continued through the first 6 weeks of the new year. Leasing business has been virtually static, although 1994 saw a strong advance in total assets, which grew 31 per cent to IPounds 1.4bn. A final of 2p is recommended, for a 3.36p total.</p>

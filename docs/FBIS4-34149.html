			<p>BFN     [Text] The news is the open letter from the brother of the  Port-au-Prince police chief to General Cedras. Mr. Evans  Francois, who is in charge of a diplomatic mission in Santo  Domingo, made some statements regarding the current juncture and  condemned the handling of power since 30 September 1991. Mr.  Francois, who demanded the resignation of Gen. Raoul Cedras,  considered that the threats of intervention in the country are  very serious. Here is a report on his statements:    [Reporter Renois] It was from Santo Domingo, the capital of  the Dominican Republic, that Mr. Evans Francois wanted to reveal  the content of his letter addressed to Gen. Raoul Cedras. The  brother of the Port-au-Prince police chief seems to have taken  very seriously the threats of intervention weighing on Haiti.    Considering that the threats were very imminent, Mr. Evans  Francois invited Gen. Cedras to make the gesture that the whole  country and the Army are expecting from him, in order to  prevent, he says, the national soil from once more being stained.    He gave the guarantee that Colonel Michel Francois was ready  to make some concessions in the nation's interest. Calling the  entourage of Gen. Cedras a jungle gathering of professional  crooked dealers, Evans Francois accused Cedras of hamstringing  all the governments since 30 September 1991. Regarding the  government of Judge Emile Jonassaint, Evans Francois revealed  that most of the members of this government were chosen by Gen.  Cedras himself.    Furthermore, he reproached the Army commander in chief for  not having agreed to resign in exchange for the lifting of the  embargo as was officially promised by the American Government.    While recognizing that he was one of the authors of 30  September 1991, Evans Francois recognized that the coup d'etat  has not been managed to the benefit of the nation and asked how  many Aristides have we created since 30 September? Finally, Mr.  Evans Francois showed great concern for the life of his brother,  the police chief. Because of his naivete, his loyalty, and his  respect for the hierarchy, he risks being eliminated following  the example of Col. Jean-Claude Paul, says Evans Francois,  specifying that the maneuvers had already started. Here is an  excerpt of this letter from Mr. Evans Francois, addressed to  Gen. Cedras:    [Begin Francois recording in progress] ... Make the gesture  that the Haitian Armed Forces, all the Haitian social strata and  the whole world, expect from you to safeguard the nation and the  only institution that we have left. Only God knows how many  concessions Col. Francois is ready to make in the framework of  safeguarding the superior interests of this small nation. I  would ask you, Mr. General, to behave honestly toward this young  officer who, because of his naivete, his loyalty, and his  respect for the hierarchy risks being eliminated, following the  example of Col. Jean-Claude Paul. The maneuvers have already  begun.    Mr. General, I, Evans Francois, who have always held up the  country's prestige in the Dominican Republic as well as in  Washington and the Bahamas, as a diplomat in charge of defending  the interests of my compatriots in strict regard for the norms  ruling international relations, have decided to address you this  open letter, at this watershed where my country's sovereignty is  threatened by the most powerful nation in the world, when the  precarious life of the officers, noncommissioned officers,  soldiers and their families, after being seriously affected by  this embargo wrongly managed, are now in danger with the  application of new sanctions due to your stubbornness, your ties  to power, your greed, and your irresponsible and ambiguous  behavior. On 30 September 1991, you made a democratic  correction. In June 1993, you supported the parliamentary act  recognizing Aristide as president. On 3 July of the same year,  you signed, on Governors Island, the agreement affixing 30  October for the return of the president in exile and [word  indistinct] your anticipated retirement. You always fought with  your reserved tactics, the constitutional government of Robert  Malval until you replaced it with the Jonassaint government  which was installed under the conditions known by everyone.

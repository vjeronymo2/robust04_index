			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Natalya Pachegina under the "Chechen Republic" </F> rubric: "Opposition Had a Hand in 12 and 13 June Events, State  Security Chief Geliskhanov Thinks"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] It has emerged from a  telephone conversation with Sultan Geliskhanov, head of  Chechnya's state security department, that the earlier quoted  figure of 50 criminals was greatly understated. Geliskhanov  maintained that at least 300 to 400 bandits offered resistance  to the government troops in the residential district. The  ringleaders' names, he said, are still being checked out, but it  is now clear that in addition to Labazanov who is hiding from  justice (he and his close associates escaped from the sealed  area 30 minutes before the storming leaving his fighting men to  the mercy of fate) and a heavily wounded Suleymanov (who is  being treated as an outpatient and being closely guarded by  state security operatives of Chechnya) there were men from  another group -- the one led by Temishev -- acting among the  criminals. The head of the Chechen security service has no  doubt that the names of some other "activists" will become known  in time. But these facts and the operational-detection work  begun by his department give grounds to assert that leaders of  the anti-Dudayev opposition were directly involved in the 12 and  13 June events in Groznyy. Geliskhanov assured NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA that he has at his disposal information that the armed  action by the Labazanov-Suleymanov group was only part of the  action planned by the opposition for 13 June. For reasons still  unknown to Geliskhanov's department, the opposition let down the  "criminals" by breaking an agreement on a joint action against  the authorities.    The confidential tone of the conversation with NEZAVISIMAYA  GAZETA must have been what made it possible for Geliskhanov to  declare that the war of the republic's authorities on the  criminal world will continue, and very soon. The place of  deployment, the numerical strength of the gangs and the weapons  they have -- all these things are known. The government troops  will begin in the coming few days to eliminate three more groups  like the one already destroyed. In the opinion of the head of  the state security of Chechnya, both the attempt on the life of  the president in late May and the Labazanov-Suleymanov armed  rebellion (for which purpose, Geliskhanov thinks, Khoza  Suleymanov was released from the Russian "Butyrka" prison) were  organized by Russia, which took advantage of the anti-Dudayev  opposition's burning desire to come back to power in the  republic. In his exclusive wish to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA Sultan  Geliskhanov remarked "it's time to stop trusting people who bill  themselves as politicians," and added that "both in Chechnya and  in Russia they have paid in blood for this sort of myopia."

			<p>940127 FT  27 JAN 94 / US to act on cable TV price loopholes The US Federal Communi-cations Commission is expected to revise its rules on cable television pricing at a meeting next month, writes George Graham. The FCC has been criticised for leaving too many loopholes for cable TV operators to exploit in the rules it wrote implementing a 1992 law designed to crack down on overpricing. That law, the only legislation on which former President George Bush saw his veto overridden by a two-thirds majority of Congress, authorised the FCC to set reasonable rates for the majority of cable companies who hold a monopoly in their district. The issue was a popular vote-getter in the 1992 election, striking a chord with customers. But many consumers felt the immediate effect of the legislation was higher rates, not the Dollars 1bn (Pounds 670m) in cuts they had been promised. An early survey suggesting that as many as 50 per cent of customers might face higher bills for their cable TV captured widespread attention. A later study of 14 of the largest operators showed, however, that rates had fallen for 68 per cent of customers. Nevertheless, many cable companies have dodged the FCC rules by manipulating tariffs.</p>

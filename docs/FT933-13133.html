			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Lloyd's wins court action LLOYD'S yesterday won the latest stage in a long-running legal action, when Mr Justice Saville ruled that five Canadian banks must allow the insurance market to draw on letters of credit taken out by Canadian Names as security for their Lloyd's membership. Names, the individuals whose capital supports underwriting at the market, have lost more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years. More than 17,000 Names are either taking or considering legal action. Five banks - the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Toronto Dominion Bank, the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Bank of Montreal and the National Bank of Canada - refused to allow Lloyd's to draw on the letters of credit on the grounds that their clients, more than a dozen Canadian Names, had alleged the losses were due to fraud. Lloyd's took action against the banks in January. Mr Saville said in yesterday's judgment in the Commercial Court that the banks must themselves plead fraud if they continue to withhold monies. The Canadian Names are among several thousand who have lost heavily at Lloyd's as a result of membership of syndicates managed by the Gooda Walker agency. Seventeen Canadians are among a group of more than 150 Names against whom Lloyd's has served writs to force payment.</p>

			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Dollar steadies at above Y100 in New York The dollar recovered slightly in New York yesterday after falling to a new postwar low of Y99.50 during trading in Tokyo on Monday. Analysts estimated that the Bank of Japan bought between Dollars 750m and Dollars 1bn (Pounds 645m) supporting the US currency but there was no repeat of Friday's concerted central bank intervention. In European trading, fears of a dollar collapse were averted and the dollar closed in London at Y99.865, rallying to Y100.43 in late New York trading. It opened in Tokyo at Y100.4. The dollar's weakness caused most European markets to open lower, before firming as the currency steadied. The FT-SE 100 Index closed at 2,899.9, up 23.3. Report, Page 20</p>

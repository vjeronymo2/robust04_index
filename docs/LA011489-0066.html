			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET RACKETEERS MUSCLE IN ON GROWING NUMBER OF PRIVATE BUSINESSES  </P> <P> Along with shortages, inflation and poor-quality goods, the Soviet Union's  small but growing number of private businessmen face a new problem: organized  crime.  </P> <P> In recent weeks, the operators of cooperative businesses, which are in the  hands of groups of individuals rather than the state, have complained of being  victimized by extortionists demanding protection money.  </P> <P> While crime is not new in the Soviet Union, the recent policy of glasnost, or  openness, has shed unusual light on the extent of racketeering, suggesting that  it poses a substantial obstacle for many of the Soviet Union's new  entrepreneurs.  </P> <P> "The number of cases of racketeering runs into the hundreds," said Anatoly  Volobuyev, a lawyer at the Ministry of the Interior.  </P> <P> "Only one-fifth of the racketeers involved have so far been brought to  account," Volobuyev told the English-language Moscow News. "As a rule,  racketeers manage to get what they want just by making threats. But there are  cases of property being destroyed and of people being beaten up, tortured.  Sometimes racketeers use weapons."  </P> <P> The cooperatives have been in existence less than two years as part of Soviet  leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort to privatize some segments of the economy  and increase the availability of goods and services.  </P> <P> Early this month, the periodical Literaturnaya Gazeta reported that at least  two cooperative cafes had been set on fire after receiving extortion threats.  </P> <P> One of them, the Hearth Rug in the Moscow suburb of Viednoya, was burned down  after the management had repeatedly asked the police for protection, the Moscow  News said. The other was identified as the Roadside Inn, in central Moscow.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bakery Owners Threatened  </P> <P> The newspaper said the owners of a bakery were threatened with death if they  failed to pay 50,000 rubles in protection money. The owners managed to borrow  30,000 rubles, about $50,000 at the official exchange rate, but the gangster  involved, who was said to have official connections, continued to make demands  for money.  </P> <P> The attacks on cooperatives have found support among the general public. The  co-ops offer goods and services not available in state shops, but many people  think their prices are exorbitant and that the entrepreneurs have become  wealthy almost overnight in a country with few wealthy people.  </P> <P> Thus when the cafe in Viednoya was set on fire, Literaturnaya Gazeta said,  personnel at a fire station across the road simply looked on. When  fire-fighting equipment arrived from Moscow, a neighbor shouted jubilantly, "At  last, they have burned the place."  </P> <P> The Moscow News said it was not calling on "everyone to fall in love with the  cooperative movement," but it demanded that the businesses be protected by the  police.  </P> <P> Yevgeny Galkin, a psychologist with the Ministry of the Interior, said, "We  predict a further increase in racketeering, the sphere of which will expand,  along with the growth of the cooperatives and the number of self-employed  workers."  </P> <P> The relative openness of the press has brought forth a spate of increasingly  lurid articles on organized crime. A recent issue of Ogonyok, a popular  illustrated magazine modeled on Life, carried a lengthy tribute to the battle  of one investigator, Vladimir Oleinik, against the Soviet equivalent of the  Mafia, a word that has found its way into the Russian language.  </P> <P> In Soviet terms, the Mafia represents a class of cunning criminals who have  enlisted government officials to help them carry out crimes against the  state-controlled economy.  </P> <P> Also, "the gangsters are forging ties with the operators of the black market,"  Ogonyok reported. In one case, what Ogonyok described as a Mafia-run fur  factory made off with every other fur, resulting in a huge loss to the state.  </P> <P> The article said a policeman was paid a bribe of 8,000 rubles a month (about  $13,200), more than two years' salary for the average Soviet policeman.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Soviet Eliot Ness  </P> <P> Investigator Oleinik, who works for what amounts to the district attorney's  office, was portrayed as a modern-day Eliot Ness, the federal agent who fought  the Chicago mob during Prohibition. Oleinik was said to have survived repeated  assassination attempts, and his wife and son-in-law were fired from their jobs  because of the Mafia's political influence.  </P> <P> A local Mafia boss was quoted as telling Oleinik in the course of an  interrogation, "You may be on top now but I will grind you into dust."  </P> <P> In a swipe at the Soviet bureaucracy, the magazine said the figures behind the  mob are "tremendously clever, gifted people." It said they are many times  smarter "than their counterparts in the official structure."  </P> <P> "Our tormented country has developed another parasite which is sucking its  juices," Ogonyok said of the mob.  </P></p>

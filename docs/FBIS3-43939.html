			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President F.W. de Klerk got the National Party [NP]  three-day election campaign in the Western Transvaal off the  ground yesterday when he addressed two meetings at  Potchefstroom. Mr. de Klerk was warmly received by an audience  of mostly first-year students at the University of  Potchefstroom. Taking the stage, he accused the African  National Congress [ANC] of intolerance and intimidation.    [Begin de Klerk recording] The ANC has robbed hundreds of  thousands, if you look back over the past ten years, of young  black South Africans of a proper education by making a political  battlefield of school education. They're a dangerous party,  they're a reality, they're strong, they have substantial  support, but there is only one party which can cut them down to  size -- and they need to be cut down to size -- and that is the  National Party. [end recording]    From the University Mr. de Klerk went to a meeting of  National Party organizers at the Potchefstroom Hall. The road  show continues this morning with meetings at Klerksdorp and  Rustenburg.</p>

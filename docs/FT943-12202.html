			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / Markets Report: Markets watch Quebec The announcement that the Canadian province of Quebec goes to the polls on September 12 yesterday provided a distraction from the market's recent pre-occupation with the dollar, writes Philip Gawith. Apart from focusing attention on Canadian economic fundamentals, it has also forced investors to consider the implications of a victory by the separatist Parti Quebecois, which is favoured to win. The Canadian dollar initially opened weaker on the news, but later recovered to finish in London at CDollars 1.3786 against the US dollar, from CDollars 1.3782 on Friday. The US dollar traded in a fairly narrow range, with markets waiting for the release on Friday of the second quarter GDP estimate. Against the D-Mark, it closed at DM1.5849 from DM1.576. Against the yen, it closed at Y98.75 from Y98.6850. Trading on the foreign exchanges was, in general, very quiet with an absence of data or events to help the market rise above mid-summer torpor. In Europe, the D-Mark turned in a mixed performance. It finished slightly lower against the French franc at FFr3.417 from FFr3.421. Amid a market holiday in Spain and thin trade, the Portuguese escudo was fixed at midday at Es102.572, its highest fixing since April 22. Sterling also had a quiet day with no news to trade off and no fresh lead from the dollar which has set the scene for the pound in recent weeks. It closed at DM2.4315 against the D-Mark from DM2.4231. Against the dollar, it finished at Dollars 1.5342 from Dollars 1.5375. The CBI's industrial trends survey today will be closely watched for information about price expectations and capacity utilisation which could influence the monthly monetary meeting later this week. The Parti Quebecois in Canada is committed to hold a referendum on secession within 10 months if it wins the election. Although opinion polls suggest that the people of Quebec are not yet ready to secede, there are rumblings that richer states like Alberta and British Columbia might break away. While these scenarios remain highly speculative in the short-term, they are likely to unsettle the currency during the election campaign. Already Canadian interest rates include a substantial risk premium and the Canadian dollar has remained the weakest of the G7 currencies. Allied to political uncertainty have been fears about the size of the budget deficit. Chase Manhattan bank estimates that the central government budget deficit to be 6.3 per cent of GDP in 1994. Against this, however, must be set a commendable inflation record which has actually seen recent falls in year-on-year consumer prices, and benefits to be had from rising commodity prices. Despite these, analysts do not rule out a re-testing of the all-time low of CDollars 1.445/USDollars ahead of the election, with a possible recovery to CDollars 1.30 in the following twelve months. The Canadian currency was trading at CDollars 1.32 at the beginning of the year. Two factors which bore on sentiment towards the dollar were fears that the German interest rate cycle might have bottomed, and the resurgence of the US-Japan trade dispute. Professor Herbert Hax, one of the German government's most senior economic advisers, said over the weekend that further cuts in German interest rates were unnecessary. With the Sunday deadline for progress in US - Japan trade procurement talks, markets have again started to worry about the dollar becoming a casualty of lack of progress in these discussions. Mr Peter Luxton, economist at Barclays in London, said the dollar was likely to trade in a narrow range ahead of Friday's GDP data. The data is seen as a key indicator for Fed policy, but the wide range of estimates has left the market uncertain about the dollar's next move. In the absence of other things to think about, the start today of Whitewater hearings before the House banking committee could cause the dollar to weaken. Whitewater refers to a set of real estate transactions in Arkansas where President Clinton and his wife have been linked to alleged improprieties. The dollar received a fillip from comments from US commerce secretary Mr Ron Brown that the US wanted to see resolution in all areas of trade with Japan. German call money remained firm at 4.85/4.95 per cent as banks started to consider the implications of an impending fixed rate repo tender, with the rate set at 4.85 per cent for the next four tenders. There are fears that banks' cash requirements will only be partially met. The Bank of England provided Pounds 309m assistance to UK money markets after forecasting a Pounds 700m shortage. Overnight money traded between 4 3/4 and 6 1/2 per cent. Trade in the futures markets was very quiet. The December eurosterling contract closed at 93.88 from 93.91, while the December euromark contract finished unchanged at 95.01. The December eurodollar contract retreated slightly from 94.15 on Friday to finish at 94.09.</p>

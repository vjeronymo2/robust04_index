			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Gyula Horn, chairman of the </F> Hungarian Socialist Party, by an unidentified correspondent from  Horn's hospital bed in Budapest -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] How are you feeling, Mr. Chairman?    [Horn] My condition has improved a lot. My hand has been  operated on and the fracture in my cervical vertebra has been  stabilized; my ribs will soon be healed as well and, of course,  the election results have helped a lot to improve my mood. The  most important lesson for me is that a wise, mature society  lives here in this country. By this I mean that a lot of things  can be said about a person, or some people, but if they are able  to demonstrate an authentic policy, people will be taken by this  and people will accept it.    [Correspondent] Is it this to which you attribute victory of  the Socialists?    [Horn] I attribute it to the sense and wisdom of these 10.5  million people, among them 8 million citizens with voting  rights. Well, 58 of our individual parliamentary candidates are  still competing -- in leading positions -- with others. We  would like to gain a decisive majority of these seats because I  am convinced that a substantial turnabout can be achieved in  this country only if the Socialist Party wins the elections with  a big majority. However, I have to add immediately that it is  not for power that we are striving but for the beginning of a  normal policy, for an end to hatred among people, for  cooperation with any power which wants to do something for the  country.    [Correspondent] Several analysts have said that it is clear  that Gabor Kuncze [prime ministerial candidate for the Alliance  of Free Democrats, SZDSZ] will be the Socialist Party's  candidate for prime minister. A leading German paper has also  written this.    [Horn] I do not know where the analysts have received this  information. It has not even occurred to us. Excuse me, but  the candidate for prime minister will be offered by the winning  party. If we have a chance for victory, the Socialist will  provide the prime minister. If the SZDSZ finishes ahead of us,  this can be discussed. I maintain my view that individuals are  not important, for whatever government comes into power, it will  have a difficult job on its hands. What is important is the  determination, the will, the program, and the team which exist  within and around the Socialist Party. This is what will decide  the next four years in Hungary.    I see everywhere that people have tremendous expectations  regarding the coming period. A change has to be made and things  will have to be put in order. The road of normal development  has to be paved. Otherwise something that one of the ladies  told me at an election forum will come to be: If you too  disappoint us, if you do not win, we will all leave home. Let  nobody leave this country, other than for touristic reasons.    The next act is the second round of the elections. After  that, coalition negotiations with the other parties can  commence. My opinion is that no democratic force should stand  against another democratic force. If we find a group or party  with whom agreement can be reached about the country's vital  issues, than an agreement has to be made. There is a need for a  turnabout but not for turning things upside down.    [Correspondent] If the Socialist Party is unable to find  coalition partners, will it be willing to form a government on  its own?    [Horn] A party supported by the majority of society (?does  not need to) form a minority government. At the moment, it  seems that the majority of society supports us. If this is also  expressed in the votes on 29 May, then society can be certain  that we will accomplish what we promised in our program.    This party does not want to exclude anyone. This party will  be open to every decent force regardless of the outcome of the  votes and [word indistinct] we will do everything to pull the  country out of the crisis.    [Correspondent] Thank you for the interview and on behalf of  the "Newsreel" program I wish you a speedy recovery.    [Horn] Thank you very much.</p>

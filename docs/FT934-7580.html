			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / The Queen's Speech: National Insurance increase will bring extra Pounds 1.9bn - Other measures THE INCREASE in National Insurance contributions by employees announced in the speech will add Pounds 1.9bn to the National Insurance Fund, the Department of Social Security said, Andrew Jack writes. The main rate of contributions will rise from 9 per cent to 10 per cent from next April, as first announced by Mr Norman Lamont, the then chancellor, in the March Budget. Contributions will rise by 1 per cent from employees earning between Pounds 56 and Pounds 420 a week. There will be no change to the rates either side of this range. Employees' earnings are taxed at 2 per cent below Pounds 56 a week, and there is no contribution on earnings in excess of Pounds 420 a week. Employers' contributions remain unchanged under the proposals, ranging on a sliding scale from zero for those earning less than Pounds 56 a week, up to 10.4 per cent for those paid any more than Pounds 195 a week. The Treasury said the increased revenue from the change would reduce the expected deficit of the National Insurance fund for 1994-95, and also the size of the Treasury grant paid from general taxation. The deficit this year was Pounds 7.5bn. Total National Insurance collected in 1993-94 was Pounds 14.5bn from employees and Pounds 19.6bn from employers.</p>

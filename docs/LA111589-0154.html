			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> KCSN CHANGES TUNE TO CLASSICAL  </P> <P> Responding to the recent shake-ups among classical music stations in Los  Angeles, KCSN-FM, a tiny public radio station licensed to Cal State Northridge,  changed from a country music format today to classical music.  </P> <P> "The opportunity in the marketplace obviously is the reason for the change,"  said KCSN (88.5) General Manager Ken Mills. "There are very few windows of  opportunity such as this for a small public station to take on a major format.  The recent demise of KFAC (which changed to a rock format on Sept. 21) and the  fine-tuning and fluctuations at (public station) KUSC have made it possible for  us to consider and now do a classical format."  </P> <P> Mills said he plans to hire some former KFAC announcers and possibly some from  KUSC for the new format that was scheduled to debut at 1:05 p.m. today with  Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. KCSN has a relatively weak signal strength (52  watts) and principally serves the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys.  </P></p>

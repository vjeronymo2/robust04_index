			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph amends the previous proposal by adding procedural protections designed to ensure that such waivers are in fact voluntary, knowing, and informed. After a represented individual has been arrested or charged in a criminal proceeding or is named as a defendant in a civil law enforcement proceeding, the proposed rule requires that several steps be taken before any substantive discussions take place. First, the government attorney must inform the individual of his or her right to speak through his or her attorney and to have that attorney present for any communications with the government attorney. Second, the represented party must waive his or her right to counsel in such a way as to indicate that the waiver is voluntary, knowing and informed. If at all possible, the attorney for the government should obtain a signed written waiver. Third, the attorney for the government must bring the matter before the appropriate district court judge, magistrate or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction. The court should be asked for a determination: That the waiver satisfies the provisions of this rule; or that substitute counsel is in place and that counsel consents to the communication; or, in the alternative, that it is appropriate for the court to appoint counsel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The rule does not, however, require that the waiver take place before the judge or magistrate. In exceptional circumstances, it may be impractical or unsafe to bring the defendant before a judge or magistrate to secure the waiver. In those cases, the tribunal must determine in advance of substantive discussions, based on the evidence before it, whether the waiver was made knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As noted above, the initiation of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ex parte  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> contacts by represented parties frequently occurs in the context of the ``fearful defendant'' whose attorney has been chosen by a third party, often an individual above the defendant in the criminal hierarchy. Such a defendant may wish to cooperate with the government but may fear that his life or safety will be endangered if his attorney learns of the cooperation. Although the need for a mechanism by which a represented party can initiate contacts with the government is particularly acute in this context, paragraph (c) is not limited to this setting. Rather, the proper inquiry is whether the represented party's waiver of the right to counsel is voluntary, knowing, and informed_not whether the represented party has established some overriding justification for his or her decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (d): Waivers at the Time of Arrest <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Paragraph (c) of this section provides the general rule regarding how a represented party may waive any protections otherwise provided under this regulation. This paragraph provides for a more specific rule dealing with a waiver at the time of arrest.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This paragraph provides that a government attorney may communicate directly with a represented party without the consent of that party's counsel at the time of his or her arrest if the represented party has been fully informed of his or her Constitutional rights at that time and has waived them. The government attorney need not comply with any of the additional requirements of paragraph (c) in such a situation. However, it is generally prudent to obtain a written waiver at the time of arrest if possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This exception is intended to preserve the ability of government attorneys to interview individuals immediately following arrest as an effective and important law enforcement tool. A substantial body of law has developed regarding the post-arrest waiver of various Constitutional rights. The Department believes that the Constitutional requirements identified in that decisional law adequately protect represented individuals following arrest. Furthermore, the effectiveness of post-arrest interviews would be significantly curtailed if the procedural requirements of paragraph (c) applied. Accordingly, this paragraph is intended to preserve this investigative tool without adding any additional procedural requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

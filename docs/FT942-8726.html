			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Societies' life links questioned Arrangements for 'ties' between life insurers and banks or building societies would have to change in order to remain worthwhile, Mr Bill Jack, general manager of General Accident Life, said yesterday. They had not sufficiently benefited customers in the past, he added. He argued that the climate of increasing competition in life products - particularly from telephone sales - meant that greater transparency should be introduced into tied arrangements, and existing cross-subsidies could end. Mr Jack said that the new regulatory regime - which would allow differential pricing - would increase the pressure for cost efficiency and highlight the attractions of very low-cost distribution methods such as telephone sales. Some life products could be suitable for selling over the telephone. Calls could be recorded for the protection of the potential investor and to satisfy the regulators, he suggested. GA's tie with North of England Building Society is at risk following the society's decision to merge with Northern Rock, which is already tied to Legal &amp; General. Other life insurers have seen ties ended as the largest societies have moved to set up their own life operations. Mr Jack forecast further distancing as those societies which had set up joint ventures moved to take greater control of them. While he underlined the benefits in terms of economies of scale from a bank or society making an arrangement with an insurer to carry out its administration in a life subsidiary, he acknowledged that even these were 'not necessarily designed to be long-term'.</p>

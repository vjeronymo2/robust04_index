			<p><P> June 20, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GANG MEMBER SENTENCED FOR KILLING CHILD  </P> <P> A South-Central Los Angeles gang member was sentenced Monday to a term of 17  years to life for the playground shooting death of a 9-year-old boy who was  caught in a gunfight between rival gang factions.  </P> <P> The June 24, 1987, death of DeAndre Brown, who was playing in a sandbox at Mt.  Carmel Park at 70th and Hoover streets, caused such widespread community  outrage that several witnesses came forward and identified Damon Thompson, then  17, as the triggerman.  </P> <P> Concern over the continual gang activity in the wake of the shooting prompted  some to initiate a campaign to rename the park for the dead boy.  </P> <P> So when word spread of the sentence imposed Monday against Thompson -- just  five days short of the second anniversary of the shooting -- residents of the  neighborhood rejoiced.  </P> <P> "Great! He deserved it," said the dead boy's foster mother, Shirley Dorsey.  "Maybe this will stop the gangs."  </P> <P> One staffer at Loren Miller Elementary School, where the victim was a  fourth-grader, added: "This is one killing that no one's forgotten. We still  remember the boy fondly."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Acrimonious Debate  </P> <P> The boy's death even figured in the sometimes acrimonious debate over the  Police Department's war with street gangs.  </P> <P> Early last year, South-Central Los Angeles community and political leaders  decried the attention, and police manpower, directed to the gang-related  shooting death of college student Karen Toshima in Westwood.  </P> <P> While the Police Department marshaled 30 detectives to track down the Alhambra  woman's killer, the community leaders wondered why similar resources were not  assigned to the repeated incidents of gang violence in some of the city's  poorest neighborhoods.  </P> <P> Eventually, a suspected gang member, Durrel DeWitt Collins, was arrested on  suspicion of murder in the death of Toshima, who was a student at Cal State  Long Beach.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rival Gangs  </P> <P> In refuting arguments from some black activists, police officials pointed out  that a task force of detectives, aided by tips from area residents, arrested  Thompson about 12 hours after DeAndre was gunned down.  </P> <P> Although the park itself has had few gang-related problems, it is in an area  contested by two rival gangs, the Menlo Gangster Crips and the Hoover Crips,  area residents said.  </P> <P> Witnesses to the shooting of DeAndre Brown told police that several members of  the Menlo Gangster Crips, including Thompson, walked to a corner of the park  and fired through a chain-link fence at several Hoover Crips members, who  returned fire.  </P> <P> The youngster, who was more than 100 yards away, was struck in the neck by a  single bullet and died half an hour later.  </P> <P> Thompson, now 19, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder earlier this year,  court officials said. Under the sentence imposed Monday by Los Angeles Superior  Court Judge Marsha N. Revel, Thompson was remanded to the custody of the  California Youth Authority.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resentencing Possible  </P> <P> The prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Ralph Shapiro, said Thompson could serve up  to seven years in the CYA.  </P> <P> If Thompson proves troublesome during that time, CYA authorities could send him  back to court for resentencing. Then, he presumably could be sent to state  prison to serve the reminder of his 17-years-to-life sentence, Shapiro said.  </P></p>

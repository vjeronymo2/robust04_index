			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOWARD ROSENBERG: PBS STAGES SMASHING, 'VERY BRITISH COUP'  </P> <P> Harry Perkins is a menace.  </P> <P> At least that's the view of the rigid Establishment -- America's CIA,  conservative elements of the British media and bureaucracy and the highest  echelons of Perkins' own government -- which sees in this newly elected prime  minister a monstrous threat who shows "alarming signs of turning into a major  statesman."  </P> <P> They're terrified because Perkins is a strong-willed reformer, a Laborite  outsider and third-generation steelworker determined to sweep away musty ways  and fulfill the campaign pledges he made to the British electorate that  overwhelmingly elected him over his Tory opponent -- presumably Margaret  Thatcher. Not merely distrusted because of a revolutionary agenda that includes  dismantling nuclear weapons and ridding British soil of U.S. military bases, he  is also targeted for destruction.  </P> <P> It's the 1990s, a very appropriate setting for "A Very British Coup."  </P> <P> Here's a promise: You'll find nothing better on television than this rousing,  provocative political thriller from Britain, airing on PBS in two parts Sunday  and Monday under the "Masterpiece Theatre" banner (at 8 each night on Channels  50 and 24, at 9 on Channels 28 and 15).  </P> <P> It's smashing.  </P> <P> You'll also find no more exhilarating performance than Ray McAnally's as  Perkins. An actor of infinite surprises who keeps you intrigued by appearing  always to withhold a little something, McAnally's work both as Perkins and that  endearing cad Rick Pym of last fall's "A Perfect Spy" on PBS affirms his lofty  ranking among character actors. He's a whopper.  </P> <P> The protagonist McAnally plays here is a tough, pragmatic, charming, slippery,  TV-smart populist of a politician who initially seems caught off guard by the  crippling problems he faces in office and the depth of the conspiracy to  undermine him. He's not a man to be underestimated, however, even though the  clandestine conspirators opposing him include a powerful media lord a la Rupert  Murdoch and Britain's closest ally, the Americans.  </P> <P> Infused by John Keane's tense, dizzying music, Mick Jackson's electrifying  direction creates somber tones of mystery and foreboding. He does more than  place you on the perilous political high wire with Perkins. He also puts you  inside the minds of the loathing plotters who consider Perkins intolerably  radical.  </P> <P> "We have to protect the freedoms our ancestors bequeathed to us," sniffs Sir  Percy Browne (wonderfully played by Alan MacNaughtan), the government's  shadowy, thin-lipped, elegantly malevolent intelligence chief, a dangerous  extension of those enduring government types who become calcified to their jobs  and tradition.  </P> <P> A sort of silky J. Edgar Hoover, Browne and his smarmy, goose-necked assistant  have at their disposal vast computerized files on everyone and the latest in  electronic bugging and spying technology that allows them to track virtually  every move the prime minister makes.  </P> <P> Less fiction than reasonable conjecture, "A Very British Coup" is that  endangered television species -- something to chew on. The notion that, in  various degrees, even democracies include secret governments within governments  that operate beyond view and without public mandate is chillingly real,  reinforced by such contemporary U.S. history as the Watergate and Iran-Contra  scandals.  </P> <P> Adapted by Alan Plater from a Chris Mullin novel, "A Very British Coup"  presents a particularly terrifying scenario by seeming to place a head of state  in the lethal grip of not only his political enemies but also his own  subordinates. The story's plot twists, dark alleys and hairpin curves all  encourage a feeling of uneasiness.  </P> <P> Always slow to back formidable, potentially controversial stories about  Washington politics, American television has offered nothing comparable to "A  Very British Coup," which aired on Britain's bold Channel Four network. Its  closest American counterpart this season would be "Favorite Son," an utterly  absurd and repellent NBC clunker about an amoral vice-presidential aspirant and  his murderous aide who lusted for power and kinky sex. "Hollywood Wives" had  more relevance.  </P> <P> Looming ahead for Hollywood scenarists is Oliver North, with one miniseries  about the life and times of Ronald Reagan's favorite son already in the works.  If honest and well executed, it may partially fill a void.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, American viewers can decide for themselves if there are lessons for  our own government in "A Very British Coup," whose conspirators are too  enamored of their own opinions to trust the will of the people.  </P></p>

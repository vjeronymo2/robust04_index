			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Madhu Dandavate: "Developing Nations' Lot: </F> Disquieting Outcome of GATT Negotiations"]    [Text] The GATT negotiations have clearly brought out two  significant features--first, the intimidating power of the  developing countries, particularly the United States, and  second, the vulnerability of the developing nations to the  pressures of the developed countries in their anxiety not to  face isolation in the global economy. Looking out the outcome of  the GATT negotiations, what is most discrnible is the colossal  failure of India in initiating united and sustained efforts by  all the developing countries, to protect their common interests  in the face of onslaught by the giants.    The GATT approach regarding agriculture is most  discriminatory. It would limit subsidies only to the upper layer  of 10 per cent of the value of the agricultural output for the  developing countries. This would rob the poor farmers of subsidy  because with increasing cost of energy and other outputs, the  sectorwise subsidy may exceed this limit.    The Dunkel proposal prescribes that the developing countries  like India must import agricultural commodities to the extent of  two per cent of domestic consumption in the first year of the  GATT agreement to be stepped up to 3.33 per cent at the end of  six years. The proposed relaxation of this condition about  imports in the case of economies facing balance of payments  crisis is not of much avail to India since our Finance  Ministry's perception of BOP [balance of payments] crisis is  that it is already overcome.    Another disturbing aspect is that insistence on procurement  and sale of food-grains at market prices will imperil the very  existence of the public distribution system despite the  assurance that it will not be disrupted. There is a lot of  ambiguity about the freedom of the farmers to multiply, exchange  and sell the seeds. The assurance secured from GATT, even on the  basis of the version of the Union Cabinet Minister, seems to be  only in regard to multiplication and exchange of seeds and not  in regard to their commercial sale. The interests of the  agriculturalists demand that while handling the problem of  application of the intellectual property rights to agriculture,  the traditional rights of Indian farmers for preservation, free  exchange and sale of seeds must remain inviolate.    The acceptance of the Dunkel proposal to change the  process-oriented law, as for instance the Indian Patents Act  (1970), to the product-oriented law will be very harmful. For  instance, in drug industry which is subject to product patent  law, the product patent holders will use their monopoly to  effect sharp rise in the prices of drugs.    The Union Commerce Minister's contention that 80 per cent of  the medicines were outside the ambit of the patent law does not  make the exorbitant rise in prices of the rest of the drugs in  any way less irksome. Merely by imposing the proposed selective  licensing and controlquite rigid in nature, the spiralling of  prices of drugs cannot be checked.There is every danger that  India's growing indigenous drug industry may be swarmed by  foreign multinationals. Under the new patent regime suggested by  GATT, the interests of product patent holders will get  precedence over public interest.    The present 1970 Patents Act based on patenting the process  and not the product needs to be protected. The extension of the  patent law to 20 years will adversely affect the research and  development activities. It is also essential that micro-organism  and biological process should be kept out of the purview of the  patent law. On the insistence of the US, GATT has provided for  phasing out of the multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) that governs  exports of textiles over a 10-year period in place of a longer  period of 15 years suggested earlier. However, this so called  concession of reducing the time frame by five years has been  offered only after securing an assurance from India to cut down  import duties on synthetic textiles, thus providing the US entry  into India's domestic market. This is bound to affect the market  for the goods of the indigenous textile industry in India. The  agreement on textiles is likely to adversely affect India  because the transition period of ten years before the eventual  opening up of the textile trade is substantially large and again  the opening up was back-loaded, that is, the actual opening  taking place only at the end of the ten-year period of  transition. One cannot ignore the fact that formation of  regional groupings like NAFTA [North American Free Trade  Association] will result in the abolition of tariff barriers for  member countries while maintaining for other countries in the  GATT system the quota and the tariff regime. This is most  harmful to India's textile trade.    The TRIMS [Trade Related Investment Measures] in the Dunkel  proposal restrict power of the Government to regulate and  control foreign investment. The provisions of the Dunkel draft  accepted by GATT give a privileged position to foreign investors  as compared to our own investors. While the foreign investors  will operate with backing of their respective governments and  will have the benefit of low interest rates, they will have no  obligation either to abide by the indigenous content regulations  or to make compulsory exports. The proposal for setting up of an  Monetary trade organization (MTO) with the integrated dispute  settlement mechanism would also allow cross-retaliation between  the three areas of intellectual property-rights, goods, and  services.    The dispute settlement mechanism as provided in MTO is  heavily weighed against the developing countries like India.  They can easily be subjected to cross-retaliation whereas they  have no means to retaliate against the developed countries. We  should therefore not be surprised if the unilateral use of the  instrument of the special and Super 301 by the US is replaced by  similar coercive retaliation by the multilateral instrument  under MTO.    The agreement finalised by GATT is a sad reminder of how  `Might is Right.' This can never be the motto of global bodies  which aspire to build harmonious and congenial relations between  various regions of the tension-ridden world on the basis of  justice and equity. In the GATT document, one sees neither the  liberal ethos nor the far-sighted vision of Willy Brandt, who  produced the monumental Brandt Commission report on  International Development Issues.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AIR SHOW TO HONOR PILOTS, BUT STAY GROUNDED  </P> <P> A B-1 bomber, F-16 fighters and other front-line military aircraft as well as  World War II fighter planes will be on display this weekend at Van Nuys  Airport's free Aviation Expo 1990.  </P> <P> Last year, the two-day event drew 150,000 people, making it the largest public  event in the San Fernando Valley, airport officials said.  </P> <P> But this year's show, unlike recent ones, will not include flying  demonstrations, a result of homeowner complaints to the Board of Airport  Commissioners last year.  </P> <P> The theme for this year's show, which is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., is "A  Salute to the Pilots of World War II." On Saturday and Sunday, there will be  ceremonies commemorating the Tuskegee Airmen, a group of black military  aviators who fought during World War II.  </P> <P> The air show will be in the airport's northwest corner, at the former Air  National Guard site on Balboa Boulevard.  </P> <P> There will be three satellite parking lots with shuttle buses -- at 8400-8520  Balboa Blvd., 16555 Saticoy St. and 17400 Victory Blvd.  </P> <P> Joint sponsors are the city Department of Airports, the Greater Van Nuys Area  Chamber of Commerce and Anheuser-Busch Inc.  </P></p>

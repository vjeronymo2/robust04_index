I needed to go  where there are a lot of Asians.  </P> <P> "I went into this profession because I am handicapped (polio) and this is the  only efficient way. And, I know that this career will help society by  counseling and by giving people emotional support.  </P> <P> "The transition didn't make me feel any different from when I was in Taiwan,  because I had a lot of clients. Not until I bought my first house and as my  children grew up I had to deal with their education and the mortgage . . .  then, I knew I had a changed environment.  </P> <P> "After a while, I knew what America was really about. But, it's not hard to  adapt here.  </P> <P> "Many times when Asians come here and they don't know where to start or how to  start a job here. Many of the problems are based on financial problems.  </P> <P> "People often ask me about their investments. For example, if they should buy a  house. The answer depends on each case.  </P> <P> "When we first came to the U.S., one of my sisters came for two weeks to help  us out. After that, we were on our own. When she left I met several friends who  lived here and they helped me.  </P> <P> "In this profession, it's easier to make friends."  </P></p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: BAT in demand Tobacco and insurance conglomerate BAT Industries was the strongest performer in the FT-SE 100 Index as it announced profits at the high end of the range of analysts' forecasts. The shares were also boosted by a firm denial that BAT was poised to launch a rights issue and closed 15 higher at 485p with 10m traded. BAT reported a 10 per cent rise in 1993 profits and raised the dividend by 8 per cent. It also hit out at speculation that it was planning a bid for Victoire, the insurance arm of Suez, of France, and was considering a large rights issue for acquisition purposes. Mr Nyren Scott Malden of BZW, the company's broker, said: 'These are very satisfactory results indeed. The company dealt with the three main fears - the worry of a rights issue, concern over cash flow and the state of Farmers (BAT's US insurance arm).' The second perceived candidate for a rights issue, Cadbury Schweppes, also issued a denial as it published profits figures. The shares jumped 10p initially but slipped back after analysts realised that the UK had not participated in the profits rise. Analysts added that Cadbury had shed no new light on the link with Dr Pepper, of the US. The shares closed unchanged at 494p.</p>

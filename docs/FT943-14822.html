			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Eco-labelling tops agenda for new group Eco-labelling and the use of trade measures for environmental ends are among the negotiating priorities set yesterday by the newly formed committee on trade and environment which will become part of the World Trade Organisation next year. The committee has decided to tackle first some of the easier and less controversial items on its seven-point work programme, which was endorsed by ministers from 120-plus countries when they met in Marrakesh in April to sign the Uruguay Round trade accords. It is due to report back to the first WTO ministerial meeting in 1996. Starting in September, the committee will discuss the compatibility with fair trade rules of environmental charges and taxes, such as carbon taxes, and environmental requirements for products including standards, packaging, labelling and recycling. The proliferation of eco-labelling schemes could become an important barrier to trade, particularly for developing countries. The committee also plans this year to consider whether fair trade rules need amending to accommodate trade provisions of international environmental agreements such as those banning trade in endangered species or in chemicals that harm the ozone layer. And it will look at the effect of environmental measures on market access, especially for goods exported by developing countries. More controversial areas, such as the 'internalisation' of environmental costs in prices, will be left to later, a move that will disappoint environmental groups. The subjects for early discussion are designed to maximise consensus between rich and poor nations, and have mostly been well worked over in a now-disbanded Gatt environment committee.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Turmoil over the Weinstock penny - The closing stages of the rescue bid for Ferranti Now that the rhetoric has died down it is time for Ferranti International's 48,000 shareholders to decide on GEC's recommended 1p a share rescue bid. Next Wednesday is the first closing date for GEC's Pounds 11.4m offer for the crippled defence electronics group - a bid which has the enthusiastic support of no one. Even GEC appears to have adopted a take it or leave it attitude to its token offers, leaving Ferranti's board, led by Mr Eugene Anderson, to undertake the difficult task of persuading shareholders representing at least 90 per cent of its 936m ordinary shares to back the bid. GEC's indifferent attitude towards the outcome of its offers to Ferranti's ordinary, special and preference shareholders may reflect confidence that it would be able to 'cherry-pick' any remaining Ferranti assets at bargain prices should its bid be rejected and the company goes into receivership. Although GEC would lose the possible, but by no means certain, benefits of Ferranti's Pounds 109m of accrued UK tax losses and Pounds 106m pension scheme actuarial surplus by purchasing from the receiver, it would save both the Pounds 11.4m cost of the offers and the cost of assuming Ferranti's net debts, contingent liabilities and overdue creditors' payments totalling about Pounds 155m. For their part Ferranti's institutional investors, who control about 60 per cent of the group's outstanding equity, have grown accustomed to bad news in the four years since the discovery of a huge fraud in the group's International Signal &amp; Control subsidiary in the US blew a massive hole the balance sheet. Since then, they have watched as Mr Anderson fought to keep Ferranti afloat by selling Pounds 500m of assets, cutting bank debt from Pounds 689m in 1989 to about Pounds 100m today, and reducing costs, including the workforce which has shrunk from 22,000 to under 4,000. However, in the absence of a higher bid the institutions will almost certainly, albeit reluctantly, accept Lord Weinstock's penny. Understandably, some of Ferranti's individual investors take a more robust and arguably less pragmatic view, arguing that GEC's offers are 'derisory' and fail to fully value Ferranti's intangible assets in particular. Opposition to the bid has crystallised around the Ferranti Shareholders Support Association, chaired by Mr John Katz, a research consultant who is conducting a spirited campaign on their behalf. Mr Katz believes shareholders are being 'steam-rollered' into accepting an inadequate offer by warnings of the dire consequences if they do not. 'They are being mugged', he says. The association, which claims a membership of some 230 shareholders speaking for more than 22m shares and probably speaks for hundreds more investors, has argued that shareholders have been provided with insufficient information on which to base an informed decision. The association has suggested that Ferranti could be worth up to Pounds 150m as a going concern and has urged Ferranti's banks to reconsider their opposition to court administration rather than receivership if the GEC bid fails. This, however, seems a forlorn hope. Indeed, Mr Anderson, a company doctor brought in to stabilise Ferranti after the ISC fiasco, argues that Ferranti has effectively been in administration since the banks agreed to a standstill arrangement in 1989. More fundamentally, he has told shareholders that Ferranti is trapped in a vicious downward spiral of dwindling orders and widening losses. 'Our weak balance sheet showing net borrowings of Pounds 98.6m against shareholders funds of Pounds 34.9m, combined with extremely tight liquidity has reduced the company's credibility when it bids for major contracts . . . this situation has led to fewer contract wins and increased losses, a weaker balance sheet and even tighter liquidity,' he said. The final straw came early in November when Ferranti was told it would have to resubmit its bid for a large Middle East air defence contract called Delmon Eye. It was at that stage that GEC was persuaded to mount its rescue bid. As a Ferranti shareholder himself, Mr Anderson says he has sympathy with some shareholders, although he also notes that 26,000 have joined the register since the ISC fraud was discovered and that 200m shares changed hands in the week after the 1p a share bid was first mooted. Nevertheless, he has acknowledged that many loyal long-term Ferranti shareholders are 'disappointed, disillusioned and angry.' He has even described GEC's bid as 'calculated to irritate.' But he has consistently argued that the GEC offer, no matter how 'mean', represents the best option for shareholders and that whatever the arguments 'shareholders must appreciate that Ferranti is worth only what someone will pay for it in its present circumstances.' Even if there were no shareholder opposition, GEC's 90 per cent acceptance target would be extremely difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, in the absence of a viable alternative, Mr Anderson has called on shareholders to be realistic and support the bid. Many will find it hard to vote with their heads and not their hearts for a GEC bid which is both paltry and unpalatable.</p>

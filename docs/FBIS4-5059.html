			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- An advisory committee has  completed the outline of a report on transferring the Diet and  other government facilities outside congested Tokyo, committee  officials said Wednesday [6 April].    The outline, set for release in June, suggested that such a  transfer would enable Japan to "realize a land structure  suitable for the 21st century." The issue of transferring the  Diet outside the capital has been debated for years.    The panel said it would also serve to facilitate political  and administrative reforms, including deregulation and  decentralization of power.    The outline will serve as the basis for an intermediate  report to be issued in June on the subject of the "significance  and effect" of making such a transfer. Afterwards, the  committee will come up with a master plan.    At the end of the month, a separate advisory panel will  begin  considering what conditions should be met before considering new  sites for the Diet. Contenders include such cities as Sendai in  northern Japan.</p>

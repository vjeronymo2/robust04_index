This is how  the left is describing [Pact for Italy leader] Segni. They  stress that, just a few months ago, he was affirming his  agreement with the Democratic Alliance [AD], first and foremost  by saying "no" to the League. According to [Democratic Party of  the Left (PDS) lower house floor leader] Massimo D'Alema,  however, the agreement signed between the Pact and the League  does not pose a problem for the progressive pole but for  [Italian People's Party (PPI) Secretary] Martinazzoli: "The  People's Party is the most to blame in its desire to guarantee  the political autonomy of a Catholic-backed force."    According to the PDS floor leader, the agreement causes  confusion since it groups together "forces that came into the  battle as opponents. Just a few months ago, Segni said he was  an alternative to the League." Has [League Secretary] Bossi  abandoned the idea of splitting Italy? "From Bossi's mouth we  have heard every possible and imaginable statement, and the  contrary." Nevertheless, continued D'Alema, out of the  confusion people could, paradoxically, find clarity "when a  power group is formed with the sole aim of repelling the  progressive pole." Moreover, the agreement is "contradictory"  with respect to the pope's letter on Catholic unity: "In the  message there is a reference to the values of solidarity and  national unity to which the political agreement of the Catholics  can be attached which contradicts the agreement with the  League." On this point, the PDS floor leader concluded that it  was not important to know whether [Fininvest President]  Berlusconi will directly enter the race because "Berlusconi has  already entered the race, with his people and his TV channels."    Claudio Petruccioli, of the PDS secretariat, was even more  explicit in his comments: "To reach this agreement, both the  League and Segni have had to `Berlusconize' themselves.  Inevitably, the same would happen to anyone who was tempted to  join the agreement."    The Rete secretariat had fiery words for Segni who had  finally revealed his hand "after deceiving the Italian people."  This "self-styled" program agreed between the Pact and the  League "is seeking to hide an electoral pact for the  geographical separation of candidates -- the north for Bossi and  the rest for Segni. We do not know whom to award the prize for  the best transformist." According to The Rete: "Instead of CAF  [previously pact uniting Craxi, Andreotti, and Forlani], for the  time being we have the SeBo, and we are waiting agonizingly for  the SeBoBo (Segni, Berlusconi, Bossi)."    What about Mario Segni's former allies? Professor Pietro  Scopola who sat beside Segni on the "referendum committee" and  who has now chosen the AD, does not appear surprised: "Yes, I  was expecting it. Besides, Segni had no choice: Either make an  alliance with the League or go to the electorate on his own,  which would be equivalent to committing political suicide. Of  course, it is a move that runs completely counter to what he  said on 10 October 1992, when he stated in no uncertain terms  that he was an alternative to Bossi. The change, however, makes  things clear -- this is the birth of a less divided right."    For [Italian Socialist Party (PSI) Secretary] Del Turco,  too,  "it was predictable: The right is in earnest, the moderates are  in earnest, the conservatives are in earnest. The side that  risks taking this situation too lightly is the left, where there  is the risk that sectarianism, divisions, and differences will  prevail." The Socialist secretary concluded: "A formation  headed by the Segni-Bossi pairing is worrying. A formation  headed by [Rete leader] Orlando's fundamentalism is not of  interest."</p>

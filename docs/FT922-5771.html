			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (12): A big effort to strengthen the China connection - Delegation due in Jun / The flow of goods and funds is growing COVENTRY has a gradually strengthening connection with China, evident in both the vehicle and leisure industries, with the flow of funds, goods and ideas moving in both directions. As far back as 1983, the City Council wanted to take advantage of what at that time was seen as China's 'open door' policy and, characteristically of a city very attached to the idea of twinning, linked-up with Jinan in Shandong province. That move came to very little and any hope that it might do so were shattered by the events of Tiannamen Square. But now the political atmosphere is changing. MGA Developments, the design and engineering company, has, purely on its own initiative, taken advantage of that. It has just completed in 27 months - against an industry norm of three or four years - a Pounds 7.69m contract to design and bring to production in China a 1.5 tonne truck for Tianjin Automotive Corporation. Production of the truck has started at the rate of 12,000 units a year. This will rise to 50,000 and over the life of the project, total production is expected to reach 500,000 units. Meanwhile MGA is seeking to win more contracts in China. It has completed a commission for the design of a four-wheeled drive vehicle and is negotiating for a further contract to bring it to production. It is also investigating another truck project. In the other direction, there is the strong possibility that Chinese funds will be invested in the council's project to bring the historic but deteriorating Coombe Abbey back to life. Coombe Abbey and the surrounding land is owned by the council but is just outside the city boundary. The Abbey is in need of repair and in its present state it has little practical use, but it is a pivotal part of a wider project which will see it restored as one of the focal points of a leisure project which will include a country hotel, a golf course with club facilities and a health centre. The council has gone into partnership with Lumley Castle, the Durham hotel company, but needs further equity funds. Now, China Construction International, a company which acts commercially but whose activities are ultimately controlled by the government, has expressed interest in providing Pounds 3m of equity for the Pounds 20m project. The matter may be settled next month when a delegation is expected. For the moment the council's dealings are through Trade Circle International, China Construction's agents in London. An investment of Pounds 3m could mean that China Construction would end up as the majority equity holder.</p>

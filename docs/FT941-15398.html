			<p>940115 FT  15 JAN 94 / German government and parliament to move to Berlin The German government and parliament will both move from Bonn to Berlin between 1998 and 2000, leaders of the country's principal political parties agreed at cross-party talks yesterday, writes Quentin Peel. Total cost of the move, agreed in principle in 1991 in spite of strong opposition in parliament and little popular support, is supposed to be kept to DM20bn, (Pounds 7.8bn) including DM2.8bn in compensation payments for Bonn. Yesterday's agreement at a summit meeting of party leaders, including the opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the mayors of Bonn and Berlin, is intended to remove lingering uncertainty about the timetable, given the current pressures on the national budget. Mr Rudolf Scharping, the leader of the SPD, said he doubted the feasibility of moving all the main government ministries to Berlin within two years. He suggested the process should begin sooner, and that it should also include reforms to amalgamate or streamline government ministries. Precise details of the move, which will involve shifting some government jobs back from Berlin to Bonn in compensation, have yet to be set out in a parliamentary law. Eight government ministries will remain entirely based in Bonn, but all ministers' offices will go to Berlin. The city of Bonn, supported by many politicians in west Germany, has been fighting a staunch rearguard action to delay the process.</p>

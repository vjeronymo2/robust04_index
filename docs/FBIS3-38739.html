			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Patrick Wintour report: "Major `May Take Only 23 </F> Euro-Seats'"]    [Text] The Conservatives are currently on course to win  only 23 European Parliamentary seats in the June elections, less  than a third of the seats available, according to new research  undertaken by the Liberal Democrats.    The research, based on the new Euro-boundaries drawn up for  the June elections, suggests that, on the latest polls published  last week, Labour could take 57 seats, the Lib Dems three and  the SNP [Scottish Nationalist Party].    The result would be a humiliation for the Conservative group  in the European Parliament, reducing Tory representation to its  smallest since Euro-elections began. One of the many casualties  would be their leader, Sir Christopher Prout.    The Lib Dems temper their analysis with a warning about the  direction of the Green vote, which in 1989 reached nearly 15  percent but has subsequently collapsed.    The Lib Dem survey suggests that Labour modesty about its  prospects, after its successes in 1989, is misplaced. The  Tories did badly in 1989, running a negative campaign, losing 13  seats and ending up with only 32 to Labour's 45. Overall,  Labour polled 40.1 percent to the Tories 34.7 percent, with the  Lib Dems on 6.1 percent. The Greens took 14.9 percent of the  vote.    This year, with the number of seats increased by six, the  constituency boundaries have been redrawn throughout England and  Wales, making straight comparisons with 1989 virtually  impossible.    Number crunchers at the Lib Dem headquarters argue that the  best way of predicting the outcome this time round is through  assessing the parties' respective shares of the general election  vote in each of the redrawn Euro constituencies.    The figures suggest that on the basis of the 1992 general  election, the Tories would have won 51 Euro-seats in which  Labour came second, and a further 15 in which the Lib Dems came  second. Labour would have won 25 seats in England and Wales in  addition to seven in Scotland.    The tables show that 12 Euro-seats which would notionally  have been held by the Tories on this basis are vulnerable to a  swing of less than 5 percent from Tories to Labour, a further  nine could go on a 10 percent swing and a further four if the  swing matches the latest MORI poll finding of a 12 percent swing  to Labour since 1992.    The Lib Dems are clearly concentrating their efforts in the  South-west and, on the basis of the 1992 elections, could take  Somerset and North Devon on a 23 percent swing and Cornwall and  West Plymouth on a 3.3 percent swing. Devon and East Plymouth  falls to an 8.4 percent swing, Wight and Hampshire South to a  9.5 percent swing.    Michael White adds. Conservative Euro-sceptics last night  moved to hoist John Major by his antifederalist rhetoric when  they urged the Prime Minister to go into the European elections  with a cast-iron guarantee never to return to the Exchange Rate  Mechanism or to enter a single European currency.    Under the banner of restoring "national self-government"  they  urge the abolition of "European Citizenship," a smaller Brussels  commission -- with no powers to initiate legislation -- and  "depoliticisation" of the Luxembourg Court. Such talk will  infuriate Britain's European partners.    Reminding Mr Major that he wrote as recently as last  September in the Economist that economic and monetary union now  had "all the quaintness of a rain dance and about the same  potency," five young MPs in the Thatcherite No Turning Back  group, led by lain Duncan Smith (Chingford) urge Mr Major to  "set out an economic agenda that will be workable" instead.</p>

			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Observer: Nought action spells trouble A sure sign that all is not well with a country's paper is when there are too many zeros to fit on the currency traders' computer screens. Both Italy and Brazil have been sufferring such embarrassment of late. The problem has been most acute in Brazil where the ever weakening cruzeiro now sells at 40,000 to the pound and rising daily. President Itamar Franco refuses to make traders' life easier by lopping off three zeros and introducing a new currency, because this would be a blow to his country's national pride. Having publicly rebuked his last finance minister for suggesting such a move, Franco has not been convinced by the planning minister's idea to rename his currency the 'strong cruzeiro'. In the meantime the more enterprising Brazilian businessmen are starting to take matters into their own hands by creating their own currency units. Lorenzetti bathroom fitters, for example, is now quoting prices in URLs, the Lorenzetti Referential Unit each of which is currently worth 22,983.63 cruzeiros. Prices will remain fixed in URLs. But the URL will, of course, accompany the roughly one per cent a day inflation. The problem of too many noughts is proving infectious. Italy has also been afflicted following the lira's fall through the L1000 mark against the D-Mark on Friday. Reuters, which provides a large share of the dealing equipment used in the currency markets, was one of the first to smell trouble when its machines started to go on the blink. The company's terminals are set up to take only three figures before the decimal point on the lira/D-Mark cross rate. So, when the lira crossed from L999 to L1000 for the first time, the computer system started rejecting the quotes. For a brief period, London dealers reported DM1 as being worth L000.00. 'Not in our lifetime,' was the comment of one 23-year-old dealer.</p>

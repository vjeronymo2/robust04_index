			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO MIDDLE GROUND IN RIVALRY;  </P> <P> BRUINS: IT'S EITHER THE THRILL OF VICTORY OR HEARTACHE OF DEFEAT AGAINST USC,  DONAHUE SAYS.  </P> <P> Terry Donahue has participated in the UCLA-USC football series for 21 years as  a player, assistant coach and head coach.  </P> <P> The cross-town rivalry is an integral, emotional part of his life and he summed  it up Monday by saying: "There's an unbelievable vacuum between the peaks and  valleys (of the games). I can remember the games like they were yesterday and  the thrill of victory and heartache of defeat are hard to describe. But there  is no land in between."  </P> <P> Donahue conceded that last year's 10-10 tie with USC might have been the vacuum  filler.  </P> <P> In most instances, though, Donahue has run the gamut of emotions in a series  that began in 1929, was discontinued from 1931 until 1936 and then resumed  until the present.  </P> <P> "The wins are the greatest of the greatest and the losses are the worst of the  worst," said Donahue of his involvement.  </P> <P> So the Trojans and Bruins will battle again Saturday at the Rose Bowl with only  pride and city bragging rights at stake.  </P> <P> Washington has already clinched a berth in the Rose Bowl game.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the importance of the game is not diluted in Donahue's mind.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of great rivalries in the country," Donahue said, "but there  is no rivalry in the United States where two major institutions share the same  city.  </P> <P> "That fuels the competitiveness. We also have the normal factors that go into a  fierce rivalry. We also have the additional factors of everybody (alumni) going  to work together, sharing the same office building, same car pool rides and  going to the same parties."  </P> <P> Asked what was his most satisfying win in the series, Donahue didn't hesitate.  </P> <P> "It was 1980," he said. "It was the first time."  </P> <P> He was referring to his first victory over USC as a head coach after four  straight losses to the Trojans.  </P> <P> Then, he reminisced about some of the games.  </P> <P> "I've been fighting this battle for a long time and that's what makes it  unique, too, the struggle and competition," Donahue said.  </P> <P> "I still have the scar where I hit the locker after the 1977 game (USC won,  29-27, on a late field goal)."  </P> <P> Donahue was on the UCLA scout team in 1964 and didn't play in the game.  However, as an undersized lineman, he vividly remembers the 1965 game that UCLA  won, 20-16, on Gary Beban's late, long touchdown pass to Kurt Altenberg.  </P> <P> "I remember Kareem Abdul-Jabbar jumping up and down on the field, saying,  'We're going to the Rose Bowl, we're going to the Rose Bowl.' He was only a  freshman at the time."  </P> <P> As for the most disappointing losses, Donahue said it was difficult to single  them out.  </P> <P> "As intense as the rivalry is, there is an element of mutual respect, or  class," Donahue said. "I never thought the rivalry was bitter as some other  rivalries. I never felt that way about this game."  </P> <P> His latest involvement was the 10-10 tie last year -- and he had mixed  emotions.  </P> <P> USC was a 17-point favorite and headed for the Rose Bowl. UCLA had a chance to  win on the final play of the game when Alfredo Velasco's 54-yard field goal try  hit the cross bar and bounced back onto the field.  </P> <P> "When that ball hit the crossbar and bounced backward, it just summed up our  season," said Donahue of his team's 3-7-1 record.  </P> <P> This time, a winning season hangs in the balance Saturday for UCLA with its 5-5  record.  </P> <P> The Bruins are coming off an emotional, 25-22 victory over Washington in  Seattle.  </P> <P> "I think the win over Washington does two things psychologically," Donahue  said. "It alerts USC that UCLA is a decent team by beating Washington. And it  certainly gives our team confidence that we beat the conference champion and  that we're capable of playing with anyone in the conference.  </P> <P> "One factor is to our disadvantage and the other to our advantage.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a great game. USC has a better record (7-2-1), but we have  a chance to win if we play our best game. It's always an exciting time for the  city."  </P></p>

			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Angola urged to prepare for elections THE US yesterday intervened in Angola's faltering peace process, telling government and opposition parties preparations for September elections were behind schedule. Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state for Africa, said in Luanda that although progress had been made, including the announcement of a date for the polls on September 29 and 30, there was still much to be done and little time to do it in. A peace accord was signed in May last year between the governing MPLA and opposition Unita movement, ending 16 years of hostilities. Mr Cohen urged the government of Mr Jose Eduardo dos Santos to complete the legalisation of opposition parties and rapidly appoint a director-general to supervise an electoral commission. He also said it was essential that the central administration be extended to territory controlled by Unita.</p>

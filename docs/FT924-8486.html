			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Scandal costs job of India's top law officer THE Rs35bn (Pounds 806m) Bombay securities market scandal yesterday claimed its most prominent victim when Mr G. Ramaswamy, the attorney general, resigned following intense public criticism of his role in the affair. According to his aides, Mr Ramaswamy cited ill health as the reason for his resignation. But it was widely believed in New Delhi last night that he had quit because of attacks on his connections with Standard Chartered Bank, the British-owned bank which has suffered heavy losses in the scandal. Mr Ramaswamy's resignation could help Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, distance his government from the scandal at a critical moment. A parliamentary committee looking into the affair is to examine key witnesses in the next week, including Mr Harshad Mehta and Mr Bhupen Dalal, the stockbrokers at the centre of the scandal. At the end of the month, parliament is due to meet for the first time since the summer, and opposition MPs plan to attack the government's handling of the affair. Also, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank which has published three reports on the scandal, is expected to release a fourth in the near future. Mr Ramaswamy is the third public figure to resign over the affair, which erupted in April in the inter-bank securities trading market. He follows Mr P. Chidambaram, the former commerce minister, who quit because of a small investment in a scandal-tainted company, and Mr V. Krishnamurthy, a former leading public sector industrialist and member of the government's planning commission, who has been charged with corruption offences over alleged links with Mr Mehta. Mr Ramaswamy, who is 63 and has been attorney general since 1990, was yesterday said to be in Madras, south India, and was not available for comment. A government spokesman confirmed the attorney general had resigned but offered no explanation. Mr Ramaswamy made his name as one of India's toughest and most successful lawyers and one who was never shy of promoting his own cause. 'I am considered No 1,' he once told an interviewer. He frequently handled sensitive political cases, including the assassination of Mrs Indira Gandhi, the former prime minister. His involvement in the securities scandal started with revelations that he was granted a Rs150,000 unsecured overdraft facility by Standard Chartered. Accusations followed that he had given legal advice to the bank about the scandal. Mr Ramaswamy and the bank denied there was anything untoward about the overdraft, which has been repaid. They also denied that Mr Ramaswamy had given the bank legal advice. Mr Ramaswamy admits he had a visit from Mr Barry Northrop, the bank's special representative for India and executive in charge of handling Standard Chartered's involvement in the scandal, but says it was 'a courtesy call.' In a magazine interview last month, Mr Ramaswamy said: 'I swear I had nothing to do with Standard Chartered Bank.' However, some of Mr Ramaswamy's fellow lawyers are unconvinced and the Delhi High Court Bar Association has started action to end his membership.</p>

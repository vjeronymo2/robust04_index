			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Italian Bonds: Signs of fatigue as sentiment sours SENTIMENT in the Italian government bond market has turned sour in the past month, with dealers warning of market fatigue. International investors have shunned the Italian market due to the political vacuum left by April's general election and the more recent rejection by Denmark of the Maastricht treaty which cast doubts on Italy's commitment to meet the European Community's convergence requirements for Economic and Monetary Union. The news sent bond prices plummeting: Italy was the worst performing of 21 leading bond markets, with a fall of 1.26 per cent in June. Although a new prime minister has been nominated, the bond market has remained extremely volatile as investors have been forced to re-examine Italy's long-term economic prospects. The new government of Mr Giuliano Amato, a former Treasury minister, may represent a serious attempt to get to grips with the country's immense structural economic problems. The market has lost patience with a political process which has been painfully slow. Should a tough economic package not be announced very soon, last week's selling could just be the prelude to a more severe crisis in the market. The problems have been exacerbated by a devaluation scare, with the Bank of Italy being forced to intervene on several occasions to support the lira. Yesterday the Bank of Italy said it would raise the official discount rate from 12 per cent to 13 per cent with effect from Monday in order to defend the currency. Few dealers seriously believe the devaluation rumours which swept the market in June, triggering heavy speculative pressure on the currency. Most recognise that altering the exchange rate would only damage the fight against inflation, which both Mr Amato and the Bank of Italy insist is their main priority. Mastering inflation, which fell to 5.5 per cent last month from 5.7 per cent in May, is the single most important factor in overcoming the immense debt burden. With by far the bulk of the deficit composed of interest payments, the emphasis on lower inflation, which would trigger lower interest rates, is understandable. At last week's auctions, the cover ratio (the total amount of bids relative to the amount of bonds on offer) was far lower than a few months ago, with foreign investors shunning the market. The auctions point to troubles ahead when the government issues much larger quantities of debt. The market is waiting to see what the government can offer to persuade it to meet its needs.</p>

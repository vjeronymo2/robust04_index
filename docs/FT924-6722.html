			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Bhutto under house arrest after march THE PAKISTAN government yesterday despatched opposition leader Ms Benazir Bhutto to the southern city of Karachi and placed her under house arrest after she tried to lead a huge protest march on the capital Islamabad in an attempt to bring down the government. In a show of force Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif flooded the capital and approach roads with troops who fired on protesters and beat them with sticks. Hundreds were arrested including Ms Bhutto and the main leaders of her opposition Pakistan People's party. Ms Bhutto contends that the conservative Islamic government of Mr Sharif is corrupt, repressive and came to power through rigging elections in 1990. She led the 18km long march from Rawalpindi to parliament in Islamabad to demand the government's dismissal and another election. Although he commands a majority in parliament, Mr Sharif was unnerved by Ms Bhutto's promise to storm the capital and may have over-reacted. Police attacked Ms Bhutto and her supporters with batons after they broke through barbed-wire barricades erected around her house in Islamabad. Ms Bhutto, who wore a bullet-proof vest, was hit several times. Later on the way to nearby Rawalpindi to begin the march police fired dozens of tear-gas shells at her vehicle. He subsequent arrest only helped to fan the anger of the crowds. In Rawalpindi protestersfought thousands of riot police and security forces battled to restore order in Islamabad and elsewhere in the country. 'My arrest won't make any difference. The struggle will continue,' Ms Bhutto told the main opposition crowd - estimated in some reports at 30,000 to 40,000 - in a brief address before being driven away. She was then flown to Karachi where she was placed under house arrest. She was also banned from the capital, Islamabad, for 30 days. In Karachi, police said Ms Bhutto and her mother, Nusrat Bhutto, would be confined to their homes in the city which have been designated as sub-jails by Sind province's Home Affairs department. Prison regulations will apply to the house. Government officials said she had been taken into protective custody and no charges had been brought. Yesterday's march represented the biggest challenge yet to the government of Mr Sharif, who was elected after Ms Bhutto was sacked for alleged corruption by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan in 1990.</p>

			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEMBLOR PUTS SCHOOL TO THE TEST;  </P> <P> EMERGENCY: NEWPORT BEACH PUPILS SCORE HIGH BY QUICKLY DUCKING LOW UNDER THEIR  DESKS, AS MOTHER NATURE SPRINGS A SURPRISE QUIZ IN GEOLOGY.  </P> <P> The faculty of Mariners Elementary School repeatedly drills its students with  lessons in how to cope with the often unpredictable actions of Mother Nature.  On Thursday, Mother Nature decided it was time for a pop quiz.  </P> <P> What do you do when the earth shakes, rattles and rolls? The students' answer:  You duck, cover and hold.  </P> <P> The answer was correct.  </P> <P> And what do you do when the earth stops shaking? The students' answer: Break  out the emergency buckets, walk outside in an orderly fashion, sit in the grass  and drink water from an emergency supply until further notice.  </P> <P> Another correct response.  </P> <P> Like all other schools in Orange County, Mariners Elementary is required to  have students perform periodic earthquake drills to give them a taste of what  conditions might be like after a major quake. And while Thursday's 4.0 quake  was not exactly The Big One, it tested whether the students had been paying  attention during drills.  </P> <P> The result: They passed with flying colors.  </P> <P> Marilyn Slaughter, the school's faculty representative for emergency  preparedness, said extensive earthquake preparation plans were put into effect  immediately after the quake hit at 10:21 a.m. Although there was no damage to  the school, she said the temblor provided another lesson to students on why the  frequent "duck-and-cover" drills are necessary.  </P> <P> "Every time we go through a drill, we go through the same thing," Slaughter  said. "We just had a drill a week or two ago. Everybody obviously knew what to  do."  </P> <P> When the earthquake struck, the school's 620 students immediately ducked  beneath their desks, covered their heads and held their positions, Slaughter  said. The quake lasted only seconds, but, just as in earthquake drills, the  students stayed beneath their desks until they finished counting to 100.  </P> <P> The "duck-and-cover" drill yielded the school's only earthquake-related injury  of the day.  </P> <P> "One kid bumped his head (on his desk)," Slaughter said. "We put an ice pack on  it. I don't know whether he was trying to get under the desk or if he bumped  his head when he was coming out."  </P> <P> The school was prepared for far more than just a minor knock on the head,  however. Slaughter said that as soon as the earthquake ended, teachers broke  out notebooks containing outlines of post-quake procedures.  </P> <P> Following drill procedures to the letter, the school activated its first aid,  search-and-rescue and student relief teams.  </P> <P> Teachers led the students out into Mariner Park, part of which serves as a  large playground for the school. Some students were assigned to bring out the  two "emergency buckets" stored in each classroom. Slaughter said one bucket  holds a first-aid kit, the class roll, name tags and a radio, while the other  contains tissue, crayons, books "and whatever else the teacher might need when  outside."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Slaughter and school principal Bruce Crockard manned the school's  Emergency Operating Center -- which holds water and more emergency supplies --  to make sure all was well.  </P> <P> Taking advantage of the chance to run an impromptu drill, the school went so  far as to set up a "sanitation area" with portable toilets and a Red Cross area  for potential injuries.  </P> <P> There were no injuries to treat, however, other than the kid who bumped his  head, Slaughter said. A sweep of the school revealed no damage.  </P></p>

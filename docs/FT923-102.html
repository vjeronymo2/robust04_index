			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Higher interest charges push down Prestwick PRESTWICK HOLDINGS, the Strathclyde-based manufacturer of printed circuit boards used in the computer, electronics and telecommunications industries, yesterday reported a decline in full-year pre-tax profits, despite a 20 per cent increase in turnover. Pre-tax profits slipped to Pounds 91,000 in the year to July 31 compared with Pounds 109,000 last time, mainly reflecting sharply higher net interest charges which grew to Pounds 455,000 (Pounds 64,000) as the group raised its borrowings to help fund acquisitions and internal investments. The company is dipping into reserves to pay an unchanged final dividend of 1p per share, which with the interim dividend, will maintain the total at 1.5p. The board said it felt justified in recommending the payment out of reserves because of the prospects for the group. Turnover increased to Pounds 30.4m (Pounds 25.3m), and profits before tax and interest grew to Pounds 546,000 (Pounds 173,000), after charging exceptional items of Pounds 76,000 (Pounds 373,000.) During the year Prestwick completed four acquisitions, Band Electronics, Prestwick-GTN, Electroconnect and Northumbria Circuits, at a total cost of Pounds 704,000. Following the acquisition of Electroconnect in October last year Prestwick spent Pounds 3m on a capital investment programme on advanced design and manufacturing technology designed to enhance the group's ability to meet its customers' needs from initial design concept to volume manufacturing. Mr Wayne Osman, chief executive, said the company had invested about Pounds 6m during the year, and had moved from zero borrowings to net borrowings of about Pounds 4m at year-end. After allowing for a Pounds 15,000 tax credit (nil) and Pounds 216,000 (Pounds 218,000) in preference share dividends the group posted an increased loss of Pounds 110,033 (Pounds 108,780), equivalent to losses per share of 0.5p (same).</p>

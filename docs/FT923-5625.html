			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets recorded a very uneventful session as London traders turned their attention away from currencies and concentrated on squaring positions ahead of the extended weakened break in the UK financial markets, writes Terry Byland. The investment fund managers stayed on the sidelines, and it was left to the local traders to provide what impetus there was. The Footsie September contract opened lower but was then squeezed higher despite the weaker trend in the pound which became more emphasised towards the end of the session. Final quotations showed the contract at a very modest premium against the underlying cash market. In traded options, overall turnover slipped to 21,828 from Thursday's 24,801 contracts, with calls totalling 9,619 yesterday. Among individual shares, British Steel topped the actives list with 2,508 contracts, as the market continued to react to selling pressures earlier in the week. It was followed by HBSC with 2,000, but business then died away, with TSB, next on the list, recording only 1,002 contracts.</p>

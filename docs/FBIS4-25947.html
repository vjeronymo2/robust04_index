			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wang Xudong (3769 2485 2639) and Ma Mingjie </F> (7456 2494 3381): "When Contributing Royalties, Deng Xiaoping's  Daughter Xiao Rong Says All Members of Her Family Are Concerned  About the Hope Project"]    [Text] On the afternoon of 7 June, Xiao Rong, author of  My Father Deng Xiaoping, came to the China Youth Fund  to contribute 15,000 yuan to the Hope Project to help some 50  pupils deprived of education in Yimeng Shan. The money had been  paid to the author by a publishing company in Shandong to  compensate for the loss of royalties resulting from copyright  infringement of the book My Father Deng Xiaoping.    Xu Yongguang, secretary general of the China Youth Fund,  expressed his thanks to Xiao Rong, saying: When we put on a  benefit performance in January this year, we made a point of  fetching some children from Bose, who had received aid from  Comrade Xiaoping, to report their study achievements at the  Great Hall of the People to grandpa Deng Xiaoping.    Xiao Rong said: The aided children in Bose wrote a letter to  father in 1992, and he was very pleased to read it. Out of  curiosity, she asked how the fund had determined that the  donation had come from her father because it was made clear at  the time of the donation that no name should be given and that  it should be given in the name of "an old communist party  member." Xiao asked with humor whether it was the comrades who  presented the money who had "divulged the secret." Xu explained  that they had been tightlipped and that the matter had been  clarified only through inquiries in many quarters.    Xiao Rong laughed and said: All of our family members are  concerned about the Hope Project. Mother has made many  donations to the Hope Project. At the beginning of this year,  she received over 4,000 yuan in back pay, which she contributed  to the Hope Project without disclosing her real name. At the  dinner table, mother also frequently calls on other family  members to contribute money to the Hope Project. When I made a  donation this time, she repeatedly said "fine" and encouraged me  to make more donations if there was such an opportunity.    Xiao Rong praised the method of "one helping one" in the  Hope  Project, saying that it was so easy to supervise and so highly  transparent that donors could set their minds at rest.    Everybody is very much concerned about Comrade Xiaoping.  Xiao Rong said: Father is 90 years old this year but he is not  suffering from any illness [dan mei you bing 0141 3093 2589  4016] and he is in very good health.</p>

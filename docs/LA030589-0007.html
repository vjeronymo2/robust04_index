			<p><P> March 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> I watch old reruns of "I Love Lucy," "Sanford and Son" and "The Honeymooners"  and they still make me laugh. The other night I watched "Roseanne" for the  first time and I didn't laugh once during the whole show. Have I lost my sense  of humor? Should I go see a psychiatrist?  </P> <P> Frederick D.

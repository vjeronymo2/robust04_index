			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "The Situation on the Korean Peninsula Becomes Tense Again"]    [Text] Pyongyang Rejects the Security Council's Call    The 15-member Security Council passed a resolution a few  days  ago calling on the DPRK to fully accept inspection by the  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] of its nuclear  facilities and requesting that it handle the problem of fuel  rods with caution. The DPRK responded by rejecting the Security  Council's call, saying that it is totally unacceptable and  unjustified. Pyongyang said in its announcement that the IAEA's  evaluation of the DPRK nuclear issue is based on an erroneous  assessment and is wholly improper. The DPRK's tough position  immediately intensified the dispute on the peninsula.    The DPRK is continuing the fuel rod removal and refusing  inspection by international nuclear experts, causing  dissatisfaction among the United States, the ROK, Japan, and  other countries. If the DPRK continues to replace those fuel  rods, the IAEA will not be able to find out whether the DPRK has  been secretly making nuclear bombs. The IAEA pointed out that  the DPRK's continuing removal of fuel rods is very serious and  can be seen as a proof by default that it is indeed developing  nuclear bombs.    The Security Council's call was softer in tone and did not  sound like an ultimatum, possibly as a result of China's  influence. China is calling on the United States, the DPRK, the  ROK, and concerned parties to sit down for frank consultations  on the "suspicion about nuclear weapons," and to refrain from  resorting abruptly to actions to isolate the DPRK, although it  is also stressing its opposition to nuclear armaments on the  Korean peninsula and its demand that the DPRK accept  international nuclear inspection.  Japan Says the DPRK Is About To Launch a Guided Missile  Test    The problem right now is that the DPRK's hardened position  has made the United States, the ROK, and Japan look at it as a  very serious matter; and the report acquired by Japan that the  DPRK might test-fire a large guided missile into the Sea of  Japan within this week only heated up the media. Japanese  Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa said on 1 June at the House of  Representatives Budget Committee that if the United Nations  still fails to come up with a decisive resolution, Japan will be  prepared to move toward a three-country joint effort to address  the issue with the United States and the ROK, on the argument  that the ROK's and Japan's security has a direct bearing on the  U.S.-Japanese Security Pact.    The United Nations will impose a naval blockade to cut off  ship transport to the DPRK in the case of economic sanctions.    Pyongyang is very nervous about such a move and has declared  that the deployment of U.S. warships to block off the DPRK may  trigger war. In fact both the DPRK and the ROK have put their  countries on emergency mobilization footings and readied  contingency plans in anticipation of war.  The DPRK Cannot Afford the Cost of War    Have developments on the peninsula reached an explosion  point? I do not believe that the matter can be this simple.  The DPRK simply cannot take it if hit by full-scale economic  sanctions. Once the sanctions are in force, remittances by  Koreans residing in Japan will be cut off, and so will grain and  oil [qi you 3086 3111] from China, and commodities obtained  through border trade. Under an economic blockade, very grave  situations may occur, one of which may be a massive outflow of  Korean people into first the ROK, and then China and Japan;  neighboring countries will all be worried.    Under economic sanctions, will the DPRK, with its "back to  the wall," go to war with the ROK? The answer is no. The DPRK  is worn out economically and, once war begins, it is absolutely  incapable of sustaining the enormous war expenditure; its  domestic economy will become a bigger concern.    ROK President Kim Yong-sam is visiting Russia, talking with  Yeltsin on how to solve the DPRK nuclear issue. Once war breaks  out on the peninsula, Russia will not support the DPRK. The  Russo-DPRK Friendship Treaty is to due to expire in two years  and is not something to count on.    For the DPRK, the best option is to accept inspection and  thus dispel international suspicions about its nuclear program.  This will benefit its relations with the United States, Japan,  and the ROK and may usher in cooperation and exchange helping it  to open up to the outside world. For the United States, the  ROK, and Japan, it is better to pursue peaceful consultations  with the DPRK and not to resort to sanctions at every turn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 25 (XINHUA) -- A direct shipping line  between Shanghai and Nagasaki in Japan was fully restored today  after a suspension of 52 years.    The return here today of the vessel "Haihua" from a six-day  round trip to Nagasaki completed the first direct sea link  between the two cities since 1942.    Nagasaki, only 462 miles away, is the nearest Japanese sea  port for Shanghai. There used to be a shipping line between the  two cities. It was suspended in 1942.    In order to promote exchanges between the two port cities,  Nagasaki County government proposed in 1988 to resume the  shipping line. Through efforts by both of governmental and  non-governmental organizations of the two cities, the shipping  line was finally opened.    Yang Zhengding, general manager of the Shanghai-Nagasaki  INternational Ferry Co. Ltd., said that the reopening of the  route reflects the common will of the people in the two cities  and the needs of economic development of the two cities.</p>

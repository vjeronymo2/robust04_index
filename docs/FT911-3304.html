			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Few tears shed for open outcry - The options market's own Big Bang SIX years after the UK stock market disappeared from its trading floor in the Stock Exchange tower and moved to a screen-based dealing system, the London Traded Options Market is about to undergo its own Big Bang. Huddled in a corner of the Stock Exchange's old dealing floor, the traded options market is all that is left of the old world of jobbers and brokers where securities were once bought and sold on a face-to-face basis. All that is about to change. After behind-the-scenes prodding by the Bank of England, the options market and the London International Financial Futures Exchange took the plunge and announced last year that they would merge. This was greeted with a huge sigh of relief by options dealers who saw merger as the only hope for a market which has failed to compete with its US and European counterparts. The hope was that the success of Liffe would rub off on the options market. So the letter which options traders received this week from the LTOM and Liffe boards will have come as nothing less than a tremendous bolt from the blue. Rather than rescuing options floor trading, the new market is to be screen-based and threatens to put many dealers out of work. Only the FT-SE 100 index option is to remain as an open-outcry market and will be joined by the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index when it is launched. 'Everyone was taken by surprise. We thought it would be five or 10 years before stock options moved onto the screens,' said a manager of an independent options brokerage. But the speed with which LTOM is to be restructured is a reflection of the desperate state the options market has reached. The daily options turnover is regularly less than the 30,000 contracts needed for LTOM to cover its costs and for brokers to break even. A round of redundancies has just been completed at a number of leading securities houses and yet costs are still out of control. Just yesterday, Hoare Govett announced it is to pull out of options market-making. The lack of business leads to less competitive quotes for options and an irregular updating of prices, which in turn discourages investors. As one options executive said: 'The quality of prices leaves an awful lot to be desired. There are 2,500 options series but on average day just 32 are updated.' Mr Tony de Guingand, managing director of LTOM, and Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive of Liffe, believe that the openness of trading options discourages investors. A broker who buys options is letting the whole market know he or she has a certain position and is then at the mercy of the market when that trade needs to be unwound. The success of the Deutsche Terminborse, the German futures and options market, and the Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange, both of which are screen-based, has encouraged LTOM into its own Big Bang. However a number of uncertainties remain: The cost of entry into the new market. Sophisticated computer technology will be required and it is not clear whether smaller independent traders will be able to afford this. Whether the new trading system will be a genuinely competitive market or will just display indicative prices for nominal amounts of options. The proponents of the new scheme vow to avoid the Stock Exchange quote machines, which suffer from these defects. But the suspicion remains that unless there are safeguards and strict supervision the options market will become dominated by a handful of large securities houses. If an anonymous market will actually encourage business. Larger institutions said the current open outcry market rarely leads to them being caught out by market-makers. As one fund manager who uses the options market said: 'Every now and again you have a problem when a trade is visible and it gets spotted. But normally there is no problem.' The number of jobs under threat. Liffe and LTOM believe it may lead to an expansion in employment. On LTOM one person can make a market in up to five stocks options. But screen-based systems need at least one market-maker per stock and there are currently 72. However, if liquidity does not pick up, there could be a drastic reduction in the number of stocks that are eventually quoted. In any case, it seems certain that the floor brokers, who can deal on behalf of Stock Exchange members, are at risk. Unless they can turn their hands to selling options, the 75 or so brokers would not appear to have an optimistic future. In spite of these reservations most options traders do not see any alternative to Liffe and LTOM's proposals and there seems little doubt that a screen-based system will emerge from the consultation of members that is under way. More importantly, the changes underline the dominance of Liffe in what looks more like a takeover than a merger. But if this increases London's importance in the growing European derivatives markets, the Bank of England is unlikely to shed any tears for the open outcry market.</p>

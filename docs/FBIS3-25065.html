This morning, it was the  senior military officers' turn to be received by the president.  The meeting, which took place at the presidential palace,  centered around only one subject -- the devaluation of the CFA  franc and the accompanying measures.    For three hours, senior officers of our Armed Forces  listened  attentively to President Soglo's message. The head of state  explained at length the reasons for this unavoidable  devaluation. He also stressed the effective taking of our  destiny into our hands since Africa has ceased to be political  pawn now that there is an end to the division of the world into  blocs. Finally, the head of state stressed the need to consume  locally produced items. To this end, he announced his plans to  rehabilitate certain abandoned projects, such as the corn mill  at Bohicon, the Save sugar factory, and Adjarala dam.    The head of state did not announce any spectacular measures,  but his message went down well. The officers understood the  head of state's explanation. [passage omitted]    The military officers used this occasion to present some of  their grievances to the head of state. The meeting took place  in a calm atmosphere. Concluding, the head of state expressed  confidence in the future of Benin and Africa. We have the  capacity to manage the situation, he said.    [Begin Soglo recording] We have acquired the habit of  consuming what we do not manufacture. We must produce the  things in our country that we can consume, whether it is sugar  produced locally or in the subregion, whether it is  horny....[pauses] There are a lot of things that we have which,  either through snobbishness, by habit, or by laziness because  somebody was buying it for us, we continue to consume. These  are things that we do not produce in our country. Now we are  being asked to look around us, to find out what we can consume  locally. Little by little, we will take off again. I think  this is the real problem we have to solve. If we decide on the  spur of the moment to create our own currency in this period of  disorder, we can do that, but we should have done that earlier  so that we would have been used to devaluation. In countries  like those in Latin America, there is devaluation practically  every year. People are used to it and act accordingly. We have  not known this for 46 years. That is why we have this traumatic  feeling about devaluation. I think that the whole of Africa  will have a reawakening, and I think we have the capacity to  bear it. [end recording]</p>

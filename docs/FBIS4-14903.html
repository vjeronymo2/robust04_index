			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Deputy Chief Editor L. Kozin: "The Communists </F> Have Won. And This Is No April Fool's Day Hoax"]    [Text] The Supreme Council elections were, generally,  conducted six weeks ago by the newspaper AKTSENT; 73.14 percent  of the participants in the "I and the Elections" poll expressed  an intention to take part in the ballot. The turnout on 27 March  was 73 percent.    Kiev sociologists from the Democratic Initiatives center,  who  conducted a poll at the start of March, maintain that 18 percent  of the participants supported capitalist relationships in  Ukraine. The responses of the participants in our poll, on the  other hand (just 2 percent of them see capitalism as the  country's future), were borne out by the election results. Among  the seven people's deputies elected in the first round, four are  communists. Among the 81 candidates who have gone on to the  second round, there are 32 members of the Communist Party, six  members of the Socialist Party, four of the Labor Party, two of  the Ukraine Citizens' Congress, one of the Peasant Party, and  one of the Liberal Party. Among those who will be competing for  the seat of deputy is a sizable number of red directors and  whose who, while not formally members of any party of an  anticapitalist focus, have, nonetheless, shown themselves to be,  in fact, their fellow travelers. The colossal success of the  extreme left and left-wing forces has confirmed the clear  orientation of the workers and peasants of the oblast toward  socialism. Impressive proof of this was the imposing victory of  P. Simonenko, first secretary of the Communist Party Central  Committee, who is today receiving the congratulations of his  comrades. There were 45,430 votes for him in Krasnoarmeyskiy  District 150 against fewer than half as many.    After we had published the results of the "I and the  Elections" poll, the newspaper heard many accusations to the  effect that we had laid it on thick, having declared in the  headline that the oblast's working people said "Yes to  socialism!" and "No to nationalism!" and that the mood in the  proletarian stronghold was, in fact, different. But we were  merely strictly recording at that time the opinions expressed by  the electorate, which were subsequently borne out on 27 March.    As anticipated, candidates of a nationalist persuasion  failed  totally. In Leninskiy Electoral District 114, Oleynik, the  representative of these forces, mustered 707 votes (against  51,083), and the results achieved in this district by  Biletskiy--2,895 (against 48,895)--were not much better. As a  counterweight to them, the communist Shapovalov won the  affections of 12,693 voters of District 114, and Deputy Prime  Minister Landik was credited with even more votes--22,354. Both  have gone on to the second round. In Kievskiy District 110, some  1,458 votes were cast for Talymonchuk, representative of the  nationalist forces, whereas 21,218 were cast for Buyko, leader  of the oblast's communists, and 20,490 for acting Prime Minister  Zvyahilskyy. In Budennovskiy District 107, a palpable defeat was  sustained by Ratnikova, only 2,343 votes were cast for her. V.  Shcherban, deputy chairman of the city council executive  committee, amassed 23,400 votes here, and Communist Party member  Kolombet, 5,064. The nationalists were unable to offer their  political opponents any in any way serious competition in other  districts either. If these figures are not astonishing,  Charodeyev's defeat in Donetsk's Proletarskiy District 116 was  sensational. It is striking that in this part of Ukraine  Charodeyev's views are shared by many people (to which the  results of an oblast consultative poll conducted on the same day  as the elections point also), but the personality of the  individual professing such views was not attractive to many  people. Some 6,741 votes were cast for him. For Fedorenko and  Ampilogov, who have moved into the second round, 15,953 and  11,795 respectively.    A defeat comparable, perhaps, only to a political coma was  sustained by the Liberal Party. One of its leaders, Tokarev, had  forecast in mid-February (precisely at the time AKTSENT was  conducting its poll) that his party "could be victorious in no  fewer than 35 districts" out of the 47. Seventeen persons had  been nominated as party candidates, and what is more, 46 members  of the Liberal Party had been registered as candidates,  according to the member of the leadership of the LPU [Liberal  Party of Ukraine]. The people and forces that created this party  drove the LPU into a corner by having called it liberal. On the  one hand it cannot garner a harvest of votes from the thin,  genuinely liberal and democratic stratum of society inasmuch as  this stratum has a dubious attitude toward the sincerity of  yesterday's party and Communist Youth League nomenklatura, which  is the backbone of the party leadership. On the other, for the  communist majority of the electorate and for this region in  general the very word "liberal" (even if authentic) is an  abusive, "bourgeois" word. The absence of a base for a growth of  its influence plus the absence of teams operating in modern  fashion, inexpressive election programs, and a number of other  aspects led to just one person for the entire oblast getting  through to the second round from the ranks of "pure" members of  the LPU. It is becoming obvious that the sole correct move made  by the leadership of the LPU prior to the elections on 27 March  was the non-nomination of its leader as a candidate.    So the first round is behind us. The second lies ahead. The  East is unfurling the red banners. The West is hoisting the  yellow and blue banners even higher. A three-color rainbow hangs  over Ukraine. There are no other colors in this country, it  seems.</p>

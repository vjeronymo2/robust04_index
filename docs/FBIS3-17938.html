			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Galina Gridneva] </F>   [Text] Riga, 30 Mar -- The Latvian Government has endorsed  the package of agreements with Russia initialled by the  delegations of both countries at talks in Moscow on 15 March.  The cabinet of ministers considers the quick signing and  ratification in the Saeima of these documents as "the only real  guarantee of the withdrawal of Russian troops from the Latvian  territory before 31 August this year," says the government  statement adopted late evening on 29 March. The document  stresses that the fixed term of the final troops pullout will  enhance the possibility of international monitoring of this  process. It also says that many countries have supported the  initialled agreements and "have described them as a success of  Latvian diplomacy."    Let us recall that of the four documents that form this  package, the national forces have mostly criticized two: on  temporarily maintaining the radio intercepting station in  Skrunde and on the social protection of military pensioners.  The government describes the treaty on the radar as a  compromise and concedes that in the absence of an agreement the  station would have been working uncontrollably for an indefinite  period. The cabinet members believe this document will enable  Latvia's cooperation with Western collective security systems  and show Latvia's readiness to reach a compromise in the  interests of the international community. As for military  pensioners, the statement says their status will be defined by  Latvian laws, "and the Russian side's claims that they should be  granted citizenship have been turned down."</p>

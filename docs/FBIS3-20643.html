And Arco's Yacheng 13-1 operation, the largest offshore  gasfield in China, is scheduled to go onstream in January 1996,  the company announced.    Arco experts have spent the last few months surveying  Chinese  onshore oil and gas fields in Daqing, Liaohe, Dagang, Sichuan  and Shengli.    "We are looking at many opportunities for onshore oil  operations," said John Knepler, vice-president of the  Shekon-based Arco China Incorporate.    "But we have to decide which ones we believe are economic to  pursue," he said.    The Yacheng field will supply natural gas through pipelines  to Hong Kong and Hainan Island. The gas will feed electric power  plants and a fertilizer factory.    "By the year 2002 the Yacheng Gasfield will be producing 9.3  million cubic metres each day, and we will have recovered our  investment," the 48-year-old vice-president said.    The gasfield, with reserves of 100 billion cubic metres, was  discovered by Arco, with the China National Offshore Oil  Corporation and the Santa Fe Energy Corporation in 1983.    At present, Arco is focusing its efforts on getting partners  for oil and gas exploration and development in China.    The average worldwide exploration success rate for 1987 to  1992 was only 6 percent.    "We know that exploration work is very risky and that is why  the successes must pay for the failures or we would go out of  business," said Knepler.    Arco is bullish on the prospects of finding large quantities  of oil and gas both onshore and offshore, he said.    Arco, which came to China in 1979, is regarded as one of the  lucky foreign oil firms which have so far operated successfully  in China.    Arco is the eighth largest non-governmental oil operator in  the world.</p>

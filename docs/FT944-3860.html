			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Private View: A modern-day Caxton - Christian Tyler meets Charles Chadwyck-Healey, who is putting the world's literature on to compact disc Five hundred years after the invention of the printing press, the second publishing revolution is being ushered in by rows of patient typists in Asia. Much like the monks who sat on their high stools in medieval scriptoria laboriously copying manuscripts, these workers are transferring the world's literary heritage on to computers for publication on magnetic tape or compact disc. Unlike the monks, they have little understanding of the words they type. But they are being paid piece-rate - so many cents per thousand words - by the entrepreneurs of the electronic revolution. One such is Sir Charles Chadwyck-Healey, an English baronet, who is employing a Filipino contractor to have 100 scribes knock out the collected works of Goethe - plus footnotes - from the old Gothic script. Other Filipinos are retyping millions of words of faded Latin and Greek for a database of the complete writings of the early Church Fathers. 'They guarantee us accuracy better than 99.9985 per cent,' said Sir Charles. 'We don't care how it's done: all we care about is the rate per thousand. If it's a viable rate, then good luck to them]' Forget the title and the double-barrelled moniker for a moment. Forget the Eton and Oxford education. This is no languid aristocrat, but a hard-headed buccaneer in the academic publishing market. Based in Cambridge and still expanding, his company has subsidiaries in Paris, Madrid and Alexandria, Virginia. Chadwyck-Healey sprang to public notice two years ago when, in partnership with the Hoover Institution, he clinched a contract to distribute on microfilm the huge archive of the former Soviet Communist Party and state. Earlier this year he completed a four-CD collection of all the published English poets from Saxon times to 1900 (price Pounds 25,000). I asked him whether book-publishing had had its day. 'No, it certainly hasn't,' he said. 'The book will continue for ever as far as I am concerned. What's happening is that something else is growing - and growing very fast. 'What we're experiencing here is very much what the early printers experienced. Caxton didn't say: 'Oh, my God, I must commission some authors to write books.' He took existing manuscripts and transcribed them into print. 'In fact many scriptoria took Caxton's printed books and copied from them because they were so much easier to read. And most of the early printers went bust because they got it wrong. They hadn't got the marketing right. They hadn't got the market out there. This will happen to many electronic publishers.' Although traditional publishers seemed frightened of the future, he said, books would never die out because they are for many purposes (reading, for instance) an efficient way of storing information. 'And we have a couple of thousand years of indoctrination into being comfortable with books. 'Though,' he added, 'I suppose sociologists would say I might be comfortable with books, being educated at Eton and Oxford, but actually 80 per cent of the people in the world are extremely uncomfortable with them.' The fifth baronet ('I thought the title might get in the way, but it hasn't') studied science at school and geography at university, where, he said, he was lucky to get a Third. He liked fast cars and still does. His first job was as a photographer on a travel magazine called Go] and his first enterprise was running a pair of trendy shops called Abacus. 'Then I spent six months writing three television plays. I thought I could do one a month and make a living. But it put me off writing as a profession: it was too demanding and isolated.' The Chadwyck-Healey family had publishing interests but Sir Charles followed his own nose. By 1972 he was ready to start up on his own in the microfilm business, an unglamorous medium which is almost universally disliked. By the end of the 1980s he was ready to go electronic; and today this is 60 per cent of his business. Most of the company's list consists of dry-as-dust bibliographies, indexes and catalogues. More accessible, though still scholarly, are ventures such as the Weimar edition of Goethe now under way (Pounds 3,000 for the equivalent of 142 volumes) and an upcoming Voltaire Electronique for the Voltaire Foundation. Alongside the Patrologia Latina of the Church Fathers (Pounds 27,000 the set) he is bringing out English Verse Drama (plays from 600AD to 1900), the Bible in its main English versions and the prime editions of Shakespeare. 'Since we're at the beginning of all this, my motto is, let's occupy the high ground. Let's not get bogged down too much in some of the specialities.' Sir Charles has contracts to publish back numbers of the 'serious' British national dailies, including this one and its sister paper, The Economist. Sometimes, the database can bite back. It is all too easy for the researcher to discover, for instance, that Sir Charles's son, Edward, was arrested with rowdy friends at Oxford for ripping up a municipal flower bed. Or to read that his sister-in-law, Julia, is the Duchess of York's aunt, when in fact she is Fergie's cousin. I asked Sir Charles if his was a literary venture or just a library service. 'It's as creative as any publishing - in some ways more so,' he said. 'Publishers wait for an author to come to them with a manuscript and the amount of editing that gets done is fairly minimal. To me the only really creative person is the author.' You obviously don't like publishers much. 'I like publishers very much, but I've never felt part of the publishing establishment or been regarded as part. It's understandable. Our publications are virtually invisible. They haven't got the impact of a beautiful book - which is why we make so much effort with our brochures.' Conventional publishers tended to recoil with horror at the electronic medium because they could not understand the market, the high price of the product or the long timescales involved. Bookshops are however starting to retail CDs of dictionaries, encyclopaedias and science for children, at between Pounds 60 and Pounds 80 a time. Sir Charles said he was not interested in the consumer market. 'But we might, for example, license a publisher to put love poems on a CD-Rom from our database, colour the CD pink and sell it in a kind of Valentine's package. 'I wouldn't attempt to do that myself because I have no feel for that kind of market. I often think that selling these databases is a bit like selling an expensive Mercedes or something: you negotiate, you discuss, the months roll by and suddenly an order appears.' Among Chadwyck-Healey's institutional customers, however, things are changing quickly. CDs are already going the way of microfilm and the 'virtual library' is round the corner. To save space (even CDs take up room), smaller libraries are either asking for the right to take words down the telephone line from a central institution as they need them - the company has already negotiated one such arrangement in the US - or even to be fed directly from Chadwyck-Healey's own headquarters. This raises the difficult question how far an electronic publisher can license onward transmission of his 'books' without losing large amounts of revenue and cutting his own commercial throat. Pirating of electronic databases is too easy, Sir Charles said, and he is afraid that a forthcoming European Union directive on copyright protection will be much too weak. At the same time he is trying - and so far failing - to negotiate with publishers and other copyright holders for permission to bring out electronic editions of modern literature. 'Our view is that you can print out of our databases until you're blue in the face. As far as individuals are concerned we really encourage that. You can go to a library which has our English Poetry and download all of Tennyson if you like. 'What we don't want is someone setting up as an electronic publisher, stealing half our database and undercutting us because he hasn't had our big production costs.' Of course you expect your return, I said. But won't others see electronic material as common property? If you are ripped off will they shed any tears? 'I don't expect anyone to shed any tears. We can fight our own battles. But if we invest a lot of money in selecting the books, deciding on the editions, coding them with this very complex coding, then I think we have a proprietary right to the data we have created in its electronic form. 'I am a relatively unsentimental person. We want to move on all the time. If it turns out in two years that creation of full texts becomes pointless, we'll just stop and do something else.' What if all these texts end up under one roof, with people like you free to charge us what you like for consulting them? 'At the end of the day anybody can do what we're doing. It's not as if we're buying rights from Goethe's heirs so as to shut Goethe off from the rest of the world for evermore. 'We're creating our own edition. If somebody doesn't want to use it, they're free to create their own. 'Or they can just go on reading it out of a book.'</p>

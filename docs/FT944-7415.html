			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Survey of Italian Banking and Finance (9): Carrot-and-stick from the state - Managed funds: small investors are becoming more interested in equities Italy may be the land of the small company, but it is not yet the land of the small shareholder. Although household savings amounted to nearly 19 per cent of disposal income in Italy last year - a higher proportion than in the US, Japan, Germany, France and the UK - less than 4 per cent of those household financial assets are invested directly in equities. Moreover, only 9.7 per cent of the average household's financial assets are entrusted to institutional investors, such as fund managers. According to the stock exchange authorities, however, the situation is changing, and ordinary investors are beginning to increase their direct or indirect holdings in equities. There are two important reasons for this metamorphosis. One is privatisation, and the other is the growth of managed investment funds and pension funds. The initial sales in the government's privatisation programme were made directly to private companies; but at the end of last year, the decision was taken to begin a series of public offers of shares in Italy's three state-controlled banks, Credito Italiano (Credit), Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI), and IMI, which were already quoted on the stock market, and the insurer Ina, 100 per cent owned by the treasury. The declared intention was to stimulate the stock market, and, as in the UK and other European countries, encourage wider share ownership. All the offers so far have been oversubscribed, but although that meant the privatisations were a success from the Italian government's point of view, certain more ambitious advocates of shareholder democracy have been disappointed by the outcome. In particular, they argue that, in spite of restrictions on share ownership, the two big retail banks - Credit and BCI - are now 'controlled' by big corporate allies of Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank which has for five decades represented Italy's biggest corporate and financial interests. To counter such accusations, the government has introduced new rules, used for the first time in the privatisation of Ina in June, which allow for a list-voting mechanism at shareholder assemblies. In the case of Ina, that meant three of the 13 seats on the board were reserved for nominees of minority shareholders. In practice, this has failed to satisfy some of the smallest shareholders, who found it difficult to reach the threshold for nominating a list of directors, and claimed that there had been little attempt by the company, the treasury and their advisers to implement the principles of shareholder democracy. 'We wanted to underline the importance of this particular assembly in the context of Italian privatisation, which has been a corporate governance nightmare until now,' said Mr Paul Dionne, of Milan-based PVD Advisories, one of the only corporate governance specialists in Italy. Mr Lorenzo Pallesi, outgoing chairman of Ina, was particularly critical of the way in which small shareholders had been treated. 'I'm sorry that the majority, though very active in supporting its own initiatives, hasn't given space to representatives of small shareholders: we'll obviously need time if Ina is to live up to the pluralism of the new company statutes,' he said, at the Ina shareholder meeting earlier this month. In the event, the three minority nominees were elected from the list proposed by Imigest, the fund management arm of IMI, indicating another path towards shareholder democracy: the growth of investment and pension funds. This process is likely to stimulated by the carrot-and-stick approach of the Italian government. It is cutting back on state pension benefits to avoid the collapse of the state system, thus forcing ordinary Italians to consider more innovative methods of retirement provision. On the other hand, it is contemplating the introduction of incentives for the establishment of pension funds. All participants in the sector are preparing for the growth of this area. For example, IMI, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, and the INPS state pension institute, are collaborating to offer advice on setting up and managing funds, while insurance companies are also readying themselves to offer more life insurance products. Whether this will prompt a revolution in the management of quoted Italian companies depends on the freedom given to fund management groups, many of which are directly owned by the same big quoted groups, which might resent any attempt to rock the boat. That said, there is already some evidence that fund managers are changing from a passive to an active role in Italian corporate life. Earlier this year, for example, a group of funds warned Sheraton, the US hotels subsidiary of ITT, that they would be particularly vigilant about how the US company exercised its control of Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group in which the funds have a minority stake. However, as Mr Pallesi's comments indicate, creeping change of this sort may not be quick enough for the impatient pioneers of Italian shareholder democracy.  --------------------------------------------------                   HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS  -------------------------------------------------- as percentage of disposable income  -------------------------------------------------- Italy                               18.9 percent Japan                               14.6 percent UK                                  14.1 percent Germany                             12.1 percent France                              11.5 percent US                                   4.6 percent  -------------------------------------------------- Source: Italian Stock Exchange Council  --------------------------------------------------</p>

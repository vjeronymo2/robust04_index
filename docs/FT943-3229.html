			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Construction output shows faster growth UK construction output is rising faster than previously forecast but construction prices are expected to remain relatively low because of overcapacity in the industry, according to separate forecasts published today. A study by Cambridge Econometrics, the private research and forecasting body, expects the value of UK construction output in constant 1990 prices to rise 2.8 per cent this year. Previous industry forecasts have suggested that the increase in output is likely to be between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. The Cambridge Econometrics forecast is in line with Department of the Environment figures, published last week, which revealed that construction output had risen 2.9 per cent in the first six months of this year compared with the first half of last year. According to Cambridge Econometrics construction output is expected to rise another 2.8 per cent next year and 2.9 per cent in 1996. The forecasters expect output to continue to grow at an average rate of 2.2 per cent a year between 1996 and 2001. A study published today by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors says that construction prices are likely to increase 5.1 in the next 12 months and 4.8 per cent in the following 12 months as building material and labour costs increase. The institution says that even so, construction prices in 1996 are likely to be 6 per cent below their 1989 peak in cash terms and 30 per cent below in real terms. As a result there is likely to be little improvement in contractors' margins until 1996. Mr Christopher Vickers, the institution's construction spokesman, said: 'Although prices are increasing, the industry's reliance on the private sector for its recovery will keep the lid on spiralling tender levels. 'With construction and land prices currently rising faster than house prices and industrial and commercial rents, there is a danger that developers' profits may disappear, forcing them to cancel building schemes, leading to further pressure on pricing as competition for work again becomes fierce.'

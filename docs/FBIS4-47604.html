			<p>SUMMARY                                Seeking to pressure the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  into accepting limited inspection of upcoming refueling  activities at Yongbyon, Pyongyang has threatened to proceed with  the replacement of  fuel rods for its 5-megawatt reactor without  an international presence.  At the same time, Pyongyang seemed to  be hinting at the possibility of some sort of compromise with the  IAEA.                           END SUMMARY     Pyongyang used the authoritative vehicle of a Foreign Ministry  spokesman's statement on 4 May to reiterate the position laid out  on 27 April that the IAEA will be permitted only to verify non-  diversion of spent fuel so as to ensure the continuity of nuclear  safeguards (Pyongyang radio, 4 May).  Claiming that for  unspecified "technical and security" reasons the refueling of the  reactor can "no longer" be delayed, the statement warned that  unless the IAEA accepts Pyongyang's terms for inspection, North  Korea will have "no alternative" but to proceed with the  refueling "according to [its own] operational plan."  Clearly  seeking to prevent the matter from being referred to the UN  Security Council, the statement maintained that even without the  presence of IAEA inspectors on the spot, the refueling activities  will technically be conducted "under thorough IAEA surveillance,"  since IAEA-installed monitoring devices and equipment will still  be operating to monitor the refueling.     Possible Compromise     Although couched in its standard self-  righteous tones, Pyongyang's latest pronouncement on the  limitations of IAEA activities appeared designed to leave North  Korea some maneuvering room to avoid a showdown with the agency.  While the statement complained that the IAEA is demanding the  "selective preservation and measurement" of spent fuel rods after  they are replaced, it seemed to focus its objection on the  measurement portion of the IAEA's demand, saying that "selective  measurement" cannot be allowed.  By avoiding an explicit  prohibition on "selective preservation" of fuel rods, Pyongyang  may be leaving the door open to allowing segregation of sample  rods for later measurement--a formulation that could prevent the  issue from being referred to the Security Council.  In fact, the  statement went on to suggest that such measurement would be  possible once the IAEA discards its "unfair attitude" toward the  DPRK and as part of a "package deal" to be worked out at future  DPRK-U.S. high-level talks.     Further seeking to project an image of reasonableness, the  spokesman's statement claimed that North Korea had already  acceded to IAEA demands for additional inspections of the  Yongbyon reprocessing plant following the incomplete IAEA  inspection last March, but that the agency has so far failed to  send inspectors for this purpose.  Pyongyang had previously  claimed only that it was "studying" the IAEA demands on this  matter.     Implications     Pyongyang's latest authoritative pronouncement  on the refueling issue suggests that the North Korean leadership  is once again testing the limits of its strategy of minimalist  accommodation in resolving the nuclear issue.

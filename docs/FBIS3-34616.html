			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eddo Rosenthal: "'Arafat's Men Watch Over Van </F> Rooy"]    [Text] Palestinian independence seemed to move a small step  closer yesterday with the arrangements during the visit by Van  Rooy, Dutch secretary of state for economic affairs, to the  occupied Gaza Strip.    The Palestinians reported that the PLO office in Gaza  together with the PLO in Tunis have been responsible for the  program for Van Rooy's visit and, for the first time, the  security arrangements for a senior foreign government  representative have been entirely in Palestinian hands. There  was no involvement by the Israelis or the UN refugee  organization.    Former Palestinian activists who have played a major role  over recent years in the intifada, the popular resistance to  Israeli occupation, guaranteed the safety of the Dutch minister  during her three-hour visit to the Gaza Strip. Men in plain  grey suits with a small Palestinian flag on their lapels guarded  the entrance to the assembly hall of the Palestinian chamber of  commerce in Gaza, where Van Rooy and her delegation of Dutch  businessmen met with Palestinian representatives led by Hayder  'Abd-al-Shafi, the former head of the Palestinian delegation at  the peace talks in Washington.    During the intifada, Jalal Shakak, the 30-year-old  Palestinian security man, was deputy commander of the youth  section of 'Arafat's Fatah resistance organization at the  Islamic university of Gaza. He has been imprisoned by the  Israeli's on ten occasions: "I am proud that I can now serve my  fatherland. In our work as security people during the visit by  the Dutch secretary of state we are demonstrating that we are  able to guarantee security and to govern ourselves."    In a convoy of local cars and accompanied by two UN buses,  the Dutch party travelled through the densely populated refugee  camps of Jabalaya and Shafi. They then continued along the  seriously polluted beaches of the Gaza Strip and Van Rooy was  able to take a look at the possible site of the first  Palestinian port in which the Netherlands is prepared to invest  40 million guilders.    During Van Rooy's visit no Israeli soldier was to be seen  and  all seemed quiet. But it was learned in the evening that  incidents had occurred during the day in Jabalaya and Shafi,  leaving 12 injured by Israeli army bullets. Half of those  wounded were children.    The Palestinians remain very divided over plans to build  their own port. Yesterday afternoon at the Palestinian  political headquarters in New Orient House in East Jerusalem,  Van Rooy met with representatives of the occupied Jordanian West  Bank. The West Bank delegation was led by the journalist and  lawyer Ziad Abu Zayad, also a member of the Palestinian  delegation at the political peace talks with Israel.    Zayad: "The Palestinian port is important. Not only because  it would provide a valuable source of revenue, but above all  because it would form one of the principal pillars of  Palestinian independence. We discussed various matters with Van  Rooy, matters which must be dealt with by every country in the  making."    Less sure about the Palestinian port is the leading  professor  of economics, Hisham Awartani, of the An-Najah University in  Nablus on the West Bank, who has met with Dutch businessmen. He  was a member of the Palestinian delegation which conducted the  (temporarily suspended) economic peace talks with the Israelis  in Paris.    "I do not believe that a port will be viable if it is  designed solely to serve the expected needs of the West Bank and  the Gaza Strip," says Awartani. "Such a port must serve the  whole region, but that would depend on the political relations  with neighboring countries. That is why we must first carefully  study the situation.    "Also, I believe that there are more urgent needs than  having  our own port. It is more urgent to do something about the  miserable housing situation in the refugee camps, especially as  we must expect foreign aid to decrease over the years. The  international euphoria has in fact already subsided."    Secretary of State Van Rooy was accompanied by around 40  Dutch businessmen; the largest business delegation from the  Netherlands ever to have visited this part of the world.</p>

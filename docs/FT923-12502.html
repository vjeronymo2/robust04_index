			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Cray rights to finance Dowty information technology deal CRAY Electronics, the Berkshire-based high technology group, yesterday confirmed that it had conditionally agreed to buy most of Dowty's information technology interests, Dowty IT, for a total of Pounds 50m. To finance the purchase it intended to raise Pounds 39m net of expenses via a one-for-two rights issue of 67.4m new shares at 61p each. Cray also announced a 36 per cent growth in profits and a return to dividend for the year ended April 30 1992. Cray said that Pounds 40m would be paid in cash together with a deferred Pounds 10m which, at its own discretion, it would pay in cash or as a medium term loan note. As well as increasing its profits in 1991-92, Cray halved gearing to 71 per cent - it had stood at over 200 per cent in earlier years. Turnover came to Pounds 84.8m, and was well down on the previous Pounds 107.3m because of disposals, but pre-tax profits advanced to Pounds 4.79m, against Pounds 3.51m. Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 3.2p (2.5p) and the dividend is the forecast 0.5p - the first payment since 1988. Sir Peter Michael, chairman, said following receipt of the Pounds 20m proceeds on the sale of Malvern Instruments, the group would be in a net cash position. Cray currently had divisions specialising in software, telecommunications and instrumentation. Its trading performance had steadily improved since Sir Peter and his team took over in 1990 to manage what had become a sprawling, badly co-ordinated group. Cray's intention was to merge its own communications arm, Craycom, with Dowty IT, to form a communications company with Pounds 180m in annual sales and a modern product line. Cray Communications, the new company, would represent 90 per cent of the Cray Group. The intention was to retain the instrumentation companies for the time being. The deal excludes Cognito, a loss making public messaging services which went into operation last year and which TI is now closing down. See Lex</p>

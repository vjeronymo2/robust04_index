Talks to end the  25- year-old communist rebellion had ground to a halt because  rebel leader Jose Maria [Joma] Sison insists on unacceptable  terms for the talks, President Ramos told a visiting European  Parliament delegation about the government's problems in talking  to the fragmented communist movement.    Joma Sison issued a statement from his exile base in Utrecht  last weekend calling on Ramos to drop his insistence that any  accord should not violate the Philippine Constitution. He also  asked for a second round of preliminary discussions to be held  in the Netherlands before peace talks open in Vietnam.    President Ramos was informed yesterday by European  parliamentarians that Utrecht-based communist leader Jose Maria  Sison and his group no longer enjoy substantial support in  Western Europe. The group told the president that Sison and his  followers are now considered an isolated group, where before had  received sympathy and support from some quarters. The visiting  parliamentarians explained that the change in attitude towards  Sison is on account of his continued adherence to the Maoist  ideology, which now belongs to the past and has almost no future.</p>

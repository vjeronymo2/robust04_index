			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / International Company News: Bundaberg bids for two Queensland sugar mills BUNDABERG Sugar Company, part of the UK's Tate &amp; Lyle sugar group, is making a ADollars 87m (USDollars 57.6m) cash offer for two sugar mills in north Queensland. The mills, which are independent of each other, are co-operatives and owned by local sugar cane growers. Bundaberg has proposed to pay just under ADollars 50m for the Tully Mill and about ADollars 37m for the South Johnstone Mill. It would then spend a further Dollars 13m on the mills over a two-year period, taking its investment to ADollars 100m. However, directors at both mills recommended that the offers be rejected as inadequate, and said they were hiring legal and financial advisers to provide further appraisals. Mr Dennis Stevens, general manager of the South Johnstone Mill, told local news agencies that the company had advised its 270 shareholders that the offer was too low. Meanwhile, Tully Sugar said its board had decided the offer was 'significantly inadequate as it values our company at less than Dollars 50m. Our board recommended to shareholders that they take no action,' the company added. The offers are conditional on 90 per cent minimum acceptance and to Foreign Investment Review Board approval. Formal documents, outlining the offer, are expected to be registered in about one week and circulated to shareholders shortly afterwards.</p>

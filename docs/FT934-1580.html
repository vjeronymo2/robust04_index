			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / London Stock Exchange: Darty nerves hit Kingfisher A range of discouraging tales surrounding Kingfisher combined to push the shares sharply lower. Most prominent of the cautionary tales was nervousness ahead of results today from Darty, the French electrical retailing subsidiary bought by Kingfisher for Pounds 560m in February this year. These figures were due a month ago but were postponed by Kingfisher for technical reasons, a move which still left some investors nervous. Analysts expect Darty to produce profits in the region of Pounds 100m. There was also talk emanating from Wall Street that one broker was speculating on the likelihood of a leading US home products group entering the UK DIY market. Statistics were said to have been produced showing the higher margins of the UK business. This, together with the fairly parlous state of the UK DIY market, encouraged suggestions that Texas Homecare, owned by Ladbroke and rumoured to be up for sale, was the most likely target. Kingfisher owns the DIY market leader B&amp;Q. Finally, there was continuing talk of flat pre-Christmas sales among stores stocks in general. Kingfisher shares ended the session 15 down at 710p. Ladbroke gained 5 at 158p.</p>

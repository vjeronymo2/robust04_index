			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Hotel bookings at a low OCCUPANCY rates at English hotels were lower in the first four months of this year than in the same period of any year since 1980, according to a survey by the English Tourist Board and Horwath Consulting, the leisure consultants. They found average monthly occupancy rates were as much as 9 percentage points below those of the same period last year, when the Gulf war severely depressed tourism. The survey found that London occupancy rates improved slightly in April to 62 per cent from 59 per cent a year before. In England as a whole occupancy was only 45 per cent - 4 percentage points lower than a year before. Mr Geoff Parkinson, a Horwath director, said the decline in the industry began in September 1990, four months before the Gulf war, and had been caused mainly by the recession. Hotels in all price ranges were suffering, and many were trading at a loss. Horwath-ETB English Hotel Occupancy Study. Horwath Consulting, 8 Baker Street, London W1M 1DA. Tel: 071-486-5191.</p>

			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Serbs seize more towns in Bosnian fighting THE MOSLEM president of Bosnia-Hercegovina has made a bitter attack on the Serbian-dominated federal Yugoslav army, as Serbs were reported to have seized further towns in the newly independent republic. The fresh turmoil coincided with confirmation that the US and the European Community are considering breaking diplomatic ties with Belgrade to increase pressure on Serbia to cease inflaming tension in Bosnia. In his attack on the federal army, Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's president, said entire villages were being razed and towns destroyed and looted while the 'murderers hide behind the backs of generals'. He was responding to an open letter from a federal army general accusing the president of 'personally orchestrating' attacks on military installations and of 'declaring war against the Yugoslav Peoples' Army'. The general warned that Mr Izetbegovic would face 'serious consequences' if a blockade of barracks and weapons factories continued. As more refugees fled trouble spots, Belgrade television said the Bosnian town of Bratunac was overrun by Serb irregulars. Media in Sarajevo reported earlier Serb troops had taken nearby Srebrenica. The two predominantly Moslem towns are near the Serbian border, as are at least four other towns taken by Serbs recently. trying to create a corridor linking regions they hold in the north-west with newly occupied areas along Bosnia's eastern borders with Serbia and its tiny ally, Montenegro. Croatian radio said the Serbian flag had been raised over Vogosca, an industrial zone in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia. At least five people were reported killed in fighting between Moslem and Serb forces for control of the zone. Fighting has nearly paralysed deliveries of food and medical supplies. Sarajevo radio said milk was unavailable in the capital. In the latest indication of US concern, the State Department said a diplomatic break with Belgrade was being weighed at the highest levels of the Bush administration. A break 'certainly is within the realm of possibility', an official said. Portugal, current EC president, said an EC break with Belgrade was being considered. The EC was also considering pushing for a United Nations trade embargo on Belgrade, a Portuguese official said. 'This is something that is being considered at the level of the EC presidency,' the official said. Yugoslav finance officials flew to the US yesterday to discuss foreign debt payments and to try to head off efforts to end Yugoslavia's membership of the International Monetary Fund, Reuter reports from Belgrade. Mr Slavoljub Stanic, deputy finance minister, and Mr Dusan Vlatkovic, National Bank governor, will hold talks with representatives of commercial bank creditors in New York before an IMF session in Washington. Mr Vlatkovic has said he wants to discuss rescheduling Yugoslavia's Dollars 15bn (Pounds 8.4bn) foreign debt. The team will also discuss the country's IMF membership following the secession of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. 'Yugoslavia simply cannot afford to lose the IMF. Without fresh money it is strangled,' said a Yugoslav economist. The mission has become more urgent because of a US drive to isolate Serbia, Yugoslavia's biggest republic, both politically and economically unless it ends what Washington calls interference in fighting in neighbouring Bosnia.</p>

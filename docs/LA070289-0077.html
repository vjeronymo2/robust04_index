			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ECCLESIASTICAL OVERSIGHT?  </P> <P> Tim Rutten should have caught on to a blatant historic error in the book,  "Russian Icons" by Father Vladimir Ivanov (Book Review, June 4). I am referring  to the statement "icons dating from the 12th to the 20th Century." The title of  this book, "Russian Icons," and the mention of the 12th Century, do not follow,  for there was no "Russia" in the 12th Century. The Moscovy State, the precursor  of modern Russia, was not founded until the middle of the 13th Century. In AD  988, the year Christianity was officially accepted in this area, the reigning  seat of power was concentrated in the Kievan State, which has a separate  history from that of Moscow. All this information is clearly spelled out in the  historic archives of various Ukrainian universities, especially in archives  dealing with religious history. However, noting that Father Ivanov is  associated with the Moscow Ecclesiastical Academy, I am not surprised at this  little historic "slip up."  </P> <P> FLORENTIO C.

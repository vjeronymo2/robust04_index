			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Interest cut bolsters Expamet A 39 per cent cut in interest charges to Pounds 830,000 helped Expamet International to raise pre-tax profits by 30 per cent from a restated Pounds 2m to Pounds 2.6m in the first half of 1994. Turnover on continuing businesses rose from Pounds 62.8m to Pounds 64.3m. The company's security and building sectors both showed improvements - at Pounds 1m (Pounds 0.9m) and Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.7m) respectively - while the industrial side, although Pounds 0.5m lower than last time at Pounds 0.6m, showed a recovery on last year's difficult second half. The lower interest charge reflected both reduced borrowings and a fall in French interest rates. At June 30, borrowings including leasing, had reduced by 20 per cent or Pounds 4m compared to mid-1993. Earnings per share were 2.71p (2.59p) and the interim dividend has been lifted from 1.25p to 1.35p.</p>

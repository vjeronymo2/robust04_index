			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of Istanbul and the Olympics (5): Water - relief is at hand / Olympic visitors may face less inconvenience than in the past If the 1980s were taken up with road and telecommunication projects in Turkey, the 1990s seem certain to be the decade for the water business. And nowhere is there is a greater need of a improved water infrastructure than in Istanbul, a city already close to a population of 9m and projected to reach 20m by the year 2010. A successful Olympic bid will no doubt spur those efforts, but Iski, the city water authority, is already planning a big investment programme. At a cost of around Dollars 5bn, the Greater Istanbul Sewage and Water Project comprises some 16 biological treatment plants and several thousand kilometres of supply pipe. In addition, Turkey is considering a large scheme to divert a river 150 miles away on the Asian mainland to augment the city's water supplies. Iski has not spent much more than Dollars 200m in any one year on capital investment. To conceive of spending as much as Dollars 500m a year - as is envisaged under the master plan - to meet the needs of the Games in 2000 represents a major challenge. As for ongoing projects, most should be complete in the next three years. The heaviest workload is projected over the next three years, and accounts for almost the total Dollars 500m to be spent on waste- water projects. A further Dollars 100m will be needed to conclude the city's various water supply projects. The one real concern is Iski's ability to handle such a heavy workload. According to some assessments, its financial position has deteriorated over the last year. Iski's income fell from Dollars 74m in 1991 to Dollars 60m last year, as collection rates have worsened. Interestingly, government institutions are the worst offenders. Demography is only one reason why the current system is under such strain. If the maze of cisterns and aqueducts is any measure, the problems of water management have taxed city planners even from Byzantine times. Today to meet the city's water needs is both an engineering and an institutional challenge. Not a moment too soon, you hear Istanbul's long-suffering residents grumble, wistfully remembering those beach holidays on the shores on the Marmara. Today only the foolhardy will swim in the waters around the city. Istanbul has just six reservoirs including Terkoz on the European side, which was constructed by the French in the 1800s. In 1990, the drought was so severe that the authorities had to ship in water from the Asian mainland. Iski also resorted to cloud seeding with a mixture of propane gas and silver iodine to encourage the rains. Nowadays, there is an additional problem - pollution. Omerli Lake on the Asian side is Istanbul's principal water source, currently supplying half the city's drinking water. Today the lake is in critical danger from contamination. Dr Ergun Goknel, the Iski president, estimates that around 600,000 illegal settlers have built homes on public land around the lake and are discharging their effluent directly into the reservoir. Iski has managed to win agreement from a number of local municipalities to prevent illegal settlements. Unfortunately, the agreement does not include the areas where the problem is most severe. The World Bank is now considering supporting a Dollars 800m programme to protect the reservoir shoreline and provide existing settlements with full water and sewage services. The Nordic Investment Bank is financing the feasibility study but there is some concern that the bank will not be willing to fund the bulk of the project. According to one expert assessment, the nearby Elmali reservoir is already unsuitable as a drinking water source. The city's sewage problem is perhaps even more urgent. At present there is not a single biological treatment plant for a population of 9m people. An estimated 90 per cent of the city's effluent is dumped unceremoniously in the Bosporus or the Sea of Marmara, damaging the coastline and polluting the waters. Mr Bedrettin Dalan, the former mayor, claimed he would make the waters of the Golden Horn as blue as his eyes - but it turned out to be an empty boast. In another controversial project, supported by the World Bank, engineers were asked to consider injecting partially treated sewage into the Bosporus, making use of the bottom current which would carry the main solids up to Black Sea where they would decompose. At the time, the project seemed to offer an ingenious solution to the city's sewage problems, utilising as it did the Bosporus' considerable powers for natural purification. The project made use of the fact of the channel's bottom current which because of the difference in salinity flowed against the main current, back into the Black Sea. The other attraction of the scheme was that it got round the problem of a large-scale land acquisition which would be required if a treatment plant was to be built. This is a major problem in such an overcrowded city. However Mr Nurettin Sozen, the new mayor, abandoned both projects and undertook a detailed review of the city's environmental policies. The Mediterranean is like a 'big sink and Istanbul is the plug,' says one foreign engineer involved in the city's water infrastructure. Iski claims its new policy is more advanced than anything in Europe, where the Community has only just adopted the ban on sea and river discharges, and the directive comes into effect only in 1998. 'In Istanbul we introduced such a code long ago, before the EC's Mediterranean convention, even before the Black Sea countries,' says Dr Goknel. The result was a new scheme, involving a tunnel, to intercept the sewage now being discharged direct into the Bosporus. The only site large enough, and with the right hydrological and environmental standards, was 40 miles away at Riva on the Black Sea. The British group Taylor Binnie and Partners, a venture between consultants Binnie and Partners and the Acer Construction group, has been awarded the design contract. Binnie claims it will be the largest treatment plant of its type in the world. Mr Jaro Pavel, a local site manager, says the tunnel itself, at some 4.6 metres, will be almost as wide as the London Underground. Many government aid agencies are eyeing opportunities in the water field. In the wake of the 1990 drought, Japan's official development arm, the Overseas Economic Co-operation Fund, is looking at the possibility of funding the Melen River project, perhaps the most ambitious proposal currently under consideration. The scheme involves construction of a pipeline 170km away on the Black Sea, a major damming complex. The cost will be more than Dollars 1bn. Only last month Iski (or Istanbul Su ve Kanalizasi Idaresi to give it its Turkish name) awarded a Pounds 100m contract to the UK company Wallace Evans, for the latest stage of what is now claimed to be the largest public health scheme in the world. The project involves construction of an 18km tunnel, 11km of open-cut sewer and a new sewage plant deploying the latest biological screening technologies. The athletes may be thankful for their efforts. The nearby Buyukcekmece lake is the proposed site for the rowing competition.</p>

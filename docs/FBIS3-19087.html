			<p>Language: <F P=105> Danish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans Engell, leader of the Conservative </F> Party, by Karen Syberg; place and date not given: "Engell: `We  Are Not Tiptoeing Anxiously Outside the Door'"]    [Excerpt] Hans Engell is proud of his success in keeping a  steady course for the Conservative Party in a difficult year,  but thinks that the party must be deserving of a return to power.    The administration has just celebrated its first  anniversary,  which of course means that the opposition also has a one-year  anniversary. What does the leader of the Conservative Party,  Hans Engell has to say about that? INFORMATION would like to  know, which is why we visited the leader at his office at  Christiansborg.    Christiansborg is mildly euphoric. It is seething with  changes in the administration. Poul Nyrup Rasmussen has just  fired Major Bergstein, Arne Melchior, and Karen Jespersen, and  Mimi Jacobsen has been appointed minister of coordination and  industrial affairs and Bente Juncker minister of social affairs.    "Normally we do not comment on such ministerial  reshuffling,"  Engell says on the phone, but nevertheless accepts the call from  the journalist at the other end of the line.    According to Engell, the reshuffle is a helping hand for a  troubled CD [Center Democrats] that thereby obtains "two weighty  appointments."    "I know Bente Juncker to be a personally involved and  dynamic  politician," he says, moreover finding it remarkable that Nyrup  changed ministers and their jurisdictions so close to a  Folketing election. But it was probably the CD's weakened  position that made it necessary. Karen Jespersen, who had not  made any mistakes, was the person who had to withdraw, because,  according to Engell, Bente Juncker's area was social policy, and  should she become minister, it would have to be in this position.  <H5>  Particular Mood </H5>   Would Engell prefer to be a minister or to be in the  opposition?    He seems to think that is has been difficult to be a  minister  at times, for instance when he was minister of justice in the  summer of 1992 when the Tamil case "lay like a shadow over  everything," and he had all together only five days off, which  he spent on the phone.    The Palestinian problem? In this case people failed to  realize that Engell as a minister was unable to do anything  about the Refugee Council's rejection of the asylum application  and that he had left an impression of trying to avoid the  responsibility of being the appeal of last resort. What did he  think about that?    "One grows to like it. If you find yourself in a besieged  castle under constant fire, a special mood arises that has its  own charm," says the former minister of defense, whose office is  decorated with an impressive collection of coats of arms. "The  problem was that I spent too much time solving problems and too  little on conducting politics."    Of course he would prefer to be in the cabinet, he says, but  "we do not tiptoe impatiently outside the door just waiting to  take over. We have lived through a difficult year, during which  we had to take responsibility for the Tamil case, regroup from  being in a position of power to being in opposition, change our  leader, and create an opposition policy. We have been able to do  this without showing any signs of panic and without changing our  policy, and I am satisfied with what we have done.    ``I have a feeling that we will be deserving of a return to  power.''  <H5>  Considerable Modesty </H5>   [Syberg] Will you admit to acknowledging that the  Conservative Party was thoroughly compromised by the Tamil case?    [Engell] No, I will not say that. I will not say that the  party has a collective responsibility, but we have received a  psychological nosebleed and it is natural that we will need a  time-out to consider.    [Syberg] Should there be a basis for a VK  [Liberal/Conservative] government after the election, will there  also be two candidates for prime minister?    [Engell] I feel very hesitant about discussing this topic.  First, we have a prime minister; and secondly, we have said that  the matter at heart is not a question of who.    [Syberg] Is that the same as saying that you know that the  Liberals will insist on Uffe Ellemann?    [Engell] No, it is not the same. Who will become prime  minister is a question of votes. The person who wins the  majority of votes in the Folketing will become prime minister.    [Syberg] But something says that it is better to remain in  the opposition for a while yet?    [Engell] No, I will not say that. There appears to be a rule  of thumb that says that the longer one is in the opposition, the  more difficult it is to escape the role of being in the  opposition.    [Syberg] You make it sound like a law of nature?    [Engell] The more time that passes the more entrenched Nyrup  will be in the prime minister's office.    [Syberg] But there must be something that the voters  determine?    [Engell] Of course. But in summing up I will say that my  intention is to return after the next election and to coordinate  the party's regaining of power and strength. But there is time  enough.  <H5>  More Ideology </H5>   The power and strength of the party is to be regained by  creating a more ideological profile, Engell opines.    [Engell] I think that we, in the eyes of the voters, stand  out like skilled craftsmen able to make agreements and that type  of thing. This has cost us something because, strangely enough,  we live in a time when ideologies apparently have gone bankrupt;  in a very ideological time, when attitudes and values are in the  seat of honor. And in those areas the profile we have kept is  too low.    Schluter would not like to hear this, but we have probably  neglected the ideological debate.    [Syberg] You appear to be the man in the Conservative wing.  Are you?    [Engell] That is because the areas I have been responsible  for are difficult areas like defense and the judicial system.  If, instead, I had been minister of social affairs or culture,  my profile would have been different. But as to attitudes, I  really am a proper, traditional conservative, thinking for  instance, that it should be made easier for the traditional  family to survive, and working for a two-track school.    "But I do not think that it is the job of society or the  party to determine how people should live," the leader stresses,  advocating a [tolerance for] a broad variety of opinions, saying  that he is happy that the Conservative Party is broad-minded  enough to include a range of "members from a middle point of  view to something that is on the edge of the Danish Society."    [Syberg] Are you happy that some of your members are at the  edge of the Danish Society?    [Engell] No, no, that is not what I meant. It was the wide  spectrum [of opinions] I was happy over!    [Syberg] Won't the Liberal Party's more ideological attitude  be a problem in a coalition?    [Engell] No, it is good to have some ideological luggage.  And  when it comes to practical politics, in reality nobody lets  himself be ruled by ideology.  <H5>  Less Ideology </H5>   [Syberg] Are you not in reality closer to a social democracy  that carries out a middle-of-the-road policy: Is there any  alternative to the welfare state?    [Engell] I prefer to call it a welfare society; but no, I do  not think there is an alternative. I do not want a state with a  minimum level of social welfare. The Conservative Party has had  a considerable coresponsibility for the social development since  the 1940's; we have voted for a majority of the most important  new laws and one would be turning one's back on the entire  development if one did not acknowledge this responsibility.  However, we do think that the richest people should help the  poorest; not that everybody should have a long list of similar  social benefits. We want a better balance.    [Syberg] Why not implement this along with the Social  Democratic Party that is working toward the same goals instead  of with the Liberal Party which is working in the opposite  direction?    [Engell] The Social Democratic Party is too much a part of  the system we know today. It is the party with the least number  of fresh ideas. They are too collectivistic in their way of  thinking.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   The similarity between the "two old city parties" that  Engell  acknowledges to be there is to a large extent due to the fact  that the political agenda has changed, so that there are more  issues that the parties must agree on, he thinks. For instance,  there is no party that does not demand a responsible  environmental policy, nobody who does not think that the  government's finances should be in order, etc.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   [Engell] Today we have more parties than unattached  political  points of view.    [Syberg] That raises the question of whether the party  system  has outlived itself. When everybody thinks the same, it does not  matter who one votes for?    [Engell] No, that is not right, because there are always  differences in attitude. Most new ideas come from the  nonsocialist side. Both the Social Democratic Party and the  Socialist People's Party stick with set ideologies.    [Syberg] When looking at your new party program "Freedom  together," one is struck by one aspect. You always write that "a  basic conservative attitude means so-and-so,  but...then comes a bunch of qualifications?"    [Engell] The reason for that is exactly that we are not an  ideological party. Conservatism is an expression of an attitude  toward life, an inner compass, but beyond that we have made  accommodations to social development.    [Syberg] You often ascribe to the basic conservative beliefs  something which is impossible to disagree with, even for a  non-Conservative, while what comes on the other side of the  but might look like it cannot be carried out based on  this basic belief. As an example you want a policy that promotes  both the environment and growth. There are at least some who  think that this is impossible?    [Engell] Not all economic growth needs to have environmental  consequences. High technology and pharmaceutical products can  easily be produced without harming the environment.    [Syberg] Is it right to say that you want to further some  forms of growth and hinder others?    [Engell] No, definitely not. We think that there is a close  relationship between growth and the environment. There is an  incredible amount of hypocrisy in the environmental debate. For  instance, look at the Soya cake. If we say that we do not want  this kind of production in the middle of a big city or in this  country, it will probably be moved to a place where the  possibility of solving the problems is much poorer. This type of  a problem must be solved using filters, safety precautions, etc.  It is growth that will finance environmental policies.  <H5>  Unworkable Program </H5>   [Engell] A party program also has the attribute that some  part of it is outdated as soon as it is in place -- while other  parts will never get done. That is why I think that the process  is just as important as the result. When working on this program  many new members will be drawn into thinking and formulating  political ideas.

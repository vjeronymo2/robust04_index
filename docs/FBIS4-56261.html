			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Antonio Navarro Wolff, </F> presidential candidate for the Colombian 19 April Movement  Democratic Alliance, in Santa Fe de Bogota by unidentified  reporter on 29 April; from the "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast  -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] We salute Dr. Antonio Navarro Wolff,  presidential candidate for the 19 April Movement Democratic  Alliance. Dr. Navarro, what is your opinion of the letter sent  hours ago by Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff to Colombian  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin on a diplomatic protest note sent  by the U.S. Department of State to the Colombian Government  complaining about the attitude of our nation's top prosecutor?  Good morning.    [Navarro] Good morning. I think the prosecutor general is  right in his conflict with sectors of the U.S. Government and  Congress because I think the attitude of placing all the blame  on us, which was assumed during the Reagan and Bush  administrations, prevails again in the United States.    I think the prosecutor general has complied with legal  norms;  he has in no way violated the law. The prosecutor general did  not draft the Penal Procedure Code; the government and the  Congress did. Thus, [words indistinct] only enforcing it.    I think the prosecutor general has been mistreated. I think  the summit of governors, which began in Popayan yesterday,  should defend the dignified and sovereign position assumed by  the prosecutor general. I do not know whether the government is  somewhat caught up between [words indistinct] and the need to  defend its judicial system. What is indeed true, however, is  that the summit of governors [words indistinct] must support the  prosecutor general and reject the discriminatory and unfair  treatment of him by U.S. authorities.</p>

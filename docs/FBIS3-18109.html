The message  was submitted by Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmud Va'ezi.    In his message, Rafsanjani welcomed the upgrading of ties  between Iran and Germany and announced Tehran's readiness to  promote bilateral regional and international cooperation.    Kohl too expressed pleasure towards expansion of bilateral  ties and voiced satisfaction with the present ties. He also  called for improvement and broadening of relations between Iran  and the European Union (EU).    Va'ezi, deputy foreign minister for Euro-American affairs,  said the existing favorable ties between Iran and Germany could  prepare the way for consolidation and expansion of Tehran's  relations with the EU.    He also announced Iran's readiness to actively cooperate  with  Germany in implementation of the second five-year development  plan (to start March 21) and to cooperate with Germany and  Europe in settlement of issues related to the Persian Gulf,  Caspian Sea Littoral States Cooperation Organization, Economic  Cooperation Organization (ECO) and internationl questions like  the mass destructive weapons.    Va'ezi and Kohl also discussed settlement of financial  issues  with the former reiterating Tehran's expectation from Bonn to  show more flexibility so as the remaining minor issues be solved  as well.    Kohl announced Bonn's readiness to employ all its potentials  to finalize all financial problems quickly.    Political circles here view Va'ezi's meeting with Kohl as an  indication of the prominence Chancellor Kohl attaches to good  relations with Iran.    Va'ezi arrived here last Monday at the invitation of his  German counterpart Dieter Kastrup.</p>

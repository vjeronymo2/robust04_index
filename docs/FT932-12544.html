			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Lawyers improve advice to suspects A SCHEME to prevent suspects at police stations receiving incompetent legal advice is to be launched by the Law Society and the Legal Aid Board, Robert Rice writes. From October 1994 the board will pay solicitors' representatives for police station work only if they have passed an independent test. The move follows widespread concern about the standard of advice being given to suspects. Research has shown that fewer than one in four people in police custody who requested legal advice saw a solicitor and that solicitors' repre-sentatives were often inexperienced and lacked proper training. Under the scheme solicitors' representatives who have not passed the test or who have not sought accreditation will have six months to develop their skills while dealing with less serious cases.</p>

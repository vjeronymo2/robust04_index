			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (20): Providers favour Pep mortgages - What's new? A sudden impulse to promote Pep mortgages appears to have struck a number of product providers simultaneously, immediately after a sharply critical report on endowments from the Office of Fair Trading and shortly before the arrival of compulsory disclosure of sales commissions. Commissions on personal equity plans are much lower than on endowments, typically 3 per cent plus a 0.5 per cent renewal commission. And, unlike endowments, Peps do not involve heavy penalties if cashed in after a few years. Peps are also being helped by the fact that most lenders have dropped their insistence on assignment of savings destined to pay off a loan. Legally, Peps cannot be assigned. Scottish Provident's Precision Pep mortgage will consist of a unit trust from SP's Prolific subsidiary packaged with a choice of insurance cover. Investors can select up to five of the eight Prolific unit trusts qualifying for Peps, paying in at least Pounds 50 per trust within the overall Pep limit of Pounds 500 a month. Charges on the trusts are an initial 5.25 per cent and an annual 1 per cent. Investors will be able to switch the Prolific trusts held in the Pep free of charge and the group will rebate any bid/offer spread. The company says it will be up to investors to seek approval from lenders for the use of the Pep to repay an interest-only loan. The onus will also be on investors to check on the progress of their savings. Scottish Provident says it will supply quotes on request but has no built-in review arrangement. Assuming 9 per cent investment growth and a 7.99 per cent mortgage rate, Scottish Provident calculates that a non-smoking man, aged 35, with a Pounds 100,000 loan over 25 years, would pay Pounds 117 a month into the Precision Pep, plus a term assurance premium of Pounds 30.95. This would bring the total monthly mortgage payment to Pounds 773.84, including Pounds 625.89 interest net of tax relief to the lender. Extra life, terminal illness and permanent disability cover add a further Pounds 18.21 to the monthly payment, while a policy including critical illness as well adds Pounds 43.45. Among unit trusts qualifying for the Pep, Prolific UK Blue Chip was up by 2.75 per cent over one year to June 1, according to Micropal, and has grown by 11.6 per cent a year since 1991. These figures were based on reinvestment of net income, rather than the gross income available in a Pep. Fidelity is selling its newly launched Pep mortgage either as a package with life cover and a loan, or simply as a Pep acceptable to a list of 40 lenders. The Pep mortgage offers a choice of 13 of Fidelity's unit trusts, focusing on Fidelity Money Builder (a fund of funds), Fidelity High Income and Fidelity UK Growth. Over the past five years, Fidelity Money Builder has put on just under 9 per cent a year, while Fidelity UK Growth has grown at close to 11 per cent annually over the same period - both allowing for the Pep tax advantage. Charges on the trusts are an initial 3 per cent and between 0.75 and 1.5 per cent annually. (Money Builder carries an additional 0.5 per cent annual charge). The minimum monthly payment per trust in the Pep is Pounds 30, and there is a 2 per cent switching fee which works out as a total switching cost of between 3 and 3.5 per cent taking into account the bid/offer spread. Five-yearly reviews are automatic, and investors will have the option of paying off part of the capital with any surplus or of switching from the Pep into a cash or gilts trust during the final years of the mortgage. At launch, Fidelity's Pep mortgage package included a discounted-rate loan from Bank of Ireland for up to 75 per cent of the property value, and term assurance from Zurich Life at a 4 per cent discount. For a man aged 35 paying off a Pounds 100,000 mortgage over 25 years, Fidelity says the monthly Pep payment would be Pounds 97 (assuming 10.5 per cent annual investment growth) plus a term assurance premium of Pounds 25.15. Parents hoping to instil savings habits into holidaying children may want to nudge offspring in the direction of a building society children's account, possibly urging them to make careful comparison of the free inducements on offer from different sources. One of the latest in this category is Woolwich for Kids, which pays 4 per cent gross on all balances and can be opened with Pounds 1. Add-ons include membership of a Woolwich for Kids club, a twice-yearly magazine, a money-box and birthday cards from Henry's Cat. Existing club members who switch from an earlier version of the account to the new account will automatically enter a competition with trips to Euro Disney, Alton Towers or Thorpe Park as prizes.</p>

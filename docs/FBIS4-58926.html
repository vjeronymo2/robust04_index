			<p>BFN     [Text] Informed Palestinian sources in Tunis have told our  correspondent Yoni Ben-Menahem that during the recent Cairo  talks the PLO agreed not to put Palestinian collaborators on  trial but refused to grant them a pardon. It is expected that  the file of the collaborators will be handled by Jibril  al-Rujub, Yasir 'Arafat's adviser, who has been appointed as the  official responsible for the West Bank's preventive security  [al-amn al-wiqa'i]. Al-Rujub is expected to return to the  territories next Friday. Moreover, Muhammad Dahlan, member of  the PLO Gaza Committee, has been appointed as the official  responsible for the Gaza Strip's preventive security.</p>

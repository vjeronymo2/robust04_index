			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 6 Apr (MENA)--Foreign Minister 'Amr Musa has  stated during their 90-minute meeting today that Presidents  Husni Mubarak and Yasir 'Arafat discussed the Middle East peace  process, especially the Palestinian-Israeli track.    In a statement after the meeting Musa said: Things are  moving slowly; we hope progress will be achieved in the next few  days.    Musa explained that the slow pace is a result of some of the  demands and the insistence on some points. The two sides, the  Israelis and the Palestinians, are having difficulty agreeing on  those things, he said.    The foreign minister stressed that Egypt is ready to assist  the two sides and do its best. We are closely watching the  talks, he said.    On today's explosion in an Israeli vehicle, where some  people  were killed, Musa said these incidents further complicate the  current situation. He expressed the hope that all these things  will be solved through negotiations and the signing of an  agreement between the two sides.    Musa hopes the Palestinians and the Israelis will sign the  agreement before 13 April.    Answering a question, the foreign minister stressed that the  Palestinians are well organized, their positions on the disputed  points are very clear, and they are ready to go forward and sign  the agreement on 12 April if possible.    Asked what he thinks of the entry of Palestinian police [to  Gaza and Jericho] before the signing of the agreement, Musa  said: If there is an agreement and an understanding between the  parties, then why not?    The foreign minister stressed the importance of continuous  the negotiations, not breaking them off today and then resuming  them tomorrow. He said the Israeli delegation must continue the  negotiations. Its departure today, even if for specific  reasons, is a kind of postponement.    Musa said he believes the negotiations should be given  precedence over any other commitments.</p>

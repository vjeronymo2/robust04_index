Talks reopened Thursday and were continuing Friday between  the rump state of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro,  and the other former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia, Croatia,  Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM], Geneva peace conference spokesman John  Mills said.    But non-Serb sources said the talks were as unproductive as  earlier sessions because the Serbian authorities refused to  provide documents needed for a realistic evaluation of the  former state's assets.    Mills said talks by the working group, headed by Danish  ambassador to Berne Els Johansson, would be "a drawn-out  process."    Another ex-Yugoslav working group, on humanitarian issues,  was due to meet Friday afternoon in Geneva headed by Sadako  Ogata of the UN High Commission for Refugees who returned  recently from a visit to Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Parliament and Politics: MoD cash details revamped THE NUMBERS of soldiers, air force officers, tanks and frigates deployed on particular commitments will be among the details given for the first time in the annual statement on defence spending. The revamped format for the white paper, which Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, is to publish early next month, will identify individual tasks, set out the manpower and equipment resources allocated to them, and give a clearer idea of the costs of the operations. The stated aim is to widen the public debate on defence spending beyond a handful of specialists, but the new way of presenting information will also help the ministry of defence in its negotiations with the Treasury during the public spending round. Because of 'double-hatting' - resources used to fulfil more than one commitment - the total cost of all the individual tasks will be far higher than the total defence budget, reinforcing the MOD's arguments about value for money. Ministers believe also that the armed forces command such 'affection and respect' from the British public, that the MOD can only gain from bringing greater openness and transparency to the defence accounts. There was initially some resistance from officials and the military, but they have now been convinced of the benefits. The revised approach will combine information which had formerly been published piecemeal or only in response to questions, with some material that has not previously been available. 'The Russians had this information but the British didn't,' one minister said yesterday. It also has the advantage of containing in a single statement details of equipment projects which have been cancelled, scaled back or delayed, thus enabling the MOD to avoid several successive 'bad news' announcements.</p>

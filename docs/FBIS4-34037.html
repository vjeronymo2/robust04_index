			<p>BFN     [Text] Port-au-Prince, 14 Jun (AFP) -- Today, the  provisional government headed by Haitian President Emile  Jonassaint (not recognized by the international community)  "fully guaranteed" that the government will ensure the safety  and unrestricted movement of foreigners living in Haiti.    The Ministry of Information, Coordination, and Culture  issued  a communique denying OAS/UN international civilian mission  (MICIVIH) and U.S. State Department allegations and added that  the lives of foreigners, especially U.S. citizens, were  threatened during the presidency of Father Jean-Bertrand  Aristide.    On Friday, Washington decided to recall some of its  personnel  from the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince and has urged U.S.  citizens to leave the country due to the "unstable political  situation."    The Information Ministry communique recalls "a series of  incidents during the seven months of Aristide's administration,  especially the Leogane affair, which resulted in the arrest of  approximately 10 U.S. citizens and almost ended in their tragic  death in a lynching inspired by President Aristide's violently  anti-U.S. speeches."    "How and why have they forgotten that anti-imperialism  fueled  state terrorism during that period and threatened -- fortunately  this is a thing of the past -- the lives of U.S. citizens and  the security of foreign embassy personnel and facilities," the  text added.    The communique also denounced the existence of a "systematic  disparagement" campaign against Haiti, describing the attitude  of the OAS/UN civilian mission as "weak" and adding that the  State Department's behavior "could cause irreparable damage to  Haiti."</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SOCKERS RENEW ARENA LEASE FOR NEXT SEASON  </P> <P> The Sockers, encouraged by Major Indoor Soccer League Commissioner Earl  Foreman, signed a one-year lease renewal for the San Diego Sports Arena Friday.  </P> <P> "A big hurdle is past today," Socker President Ron Cady said. "I feel a lot  better than I did 24 hours ago."  </P> <P> Cady said the Sockers are sticking to their original position that they will  only compete if there are eight teams in the league. Because the Los Angeles  Lazers have folded, the future of both the Sockers and the MISL probably rests  with St. Louis' plans to become the league's second expansion franchise next  season, joining the Cleveland Crunch.  </P> <P> Cady said Foreman expressed optimism that the league would wind up with eight  teams for the 1989-90 season.  </P> <P> MISL owners and coaches will meet next week in Wichita to finalize financial  details and commitments for next season.  </P> <P> TENNIS  </P> <P> Kevin Bradley of Las Vegas recorded the day's biggest upset when he ousted  third-seeded Brian Turner of San Diego in the men's open division of the 73rd  La Jolla Beach and Tennis Championships. Bradley defeated two-time open winner  Turner, 6-1, 6-3.  </P> <P> Defending open champion and top-seeded Yoiam Baron of San Diego defeated San  Diego's Jon Hoffpanir, 6-1, 6-1, in the tournament's second round of 32. All  other seeded players advanced to today's third round, which begins at 9 a.m. at  the La Jolla Recreation Center.  </P> <P> In the first round of women's open play, fourth-seeded Christy Drage of San  Diego defeated Jennifer Demsey of Rancho Santa Fe, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.

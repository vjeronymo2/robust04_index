			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 23 (XINHUA) -- The momentum of price  rises in China has gradually subsided since March this year and  the price increase rate has started to fall again, according to  Zou Xiangqun, deputy secretary-general of the State Planning  Commission.    In an interview with XINHUA, Zou attributed this achievement  to the various reform measures which the State Council and the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China have taken to  strengthen macro control of the national economy.    Zou said that generally retail sale prices throughout the  country in May this year were 18.9 percent higher than in the  same period last year. The figure is 0.6 percentage points  lower than in April this year.    He revealed that the rate of increase of retail sale prices  in the country's 35 large and medium-sized cities in may this  year was 1.3 percent lower than in April.    Apart from garments, the price increase rate of all  categories of commodities in May was lower than in April. The  price increase rate of food in May was down by 0.3 percent  compared with April's, while that of household appliances  dropped by 0.5 percentage points and medical products by 0.5,  transport and telecommunications fares by 0.9, recreation,  education and cultural commodities by 0.4, housing by 1.7 and  service fees by 0.8.    Zou predicted that the national increase rate of commodities  will continue to drop in the coming period.    Speaking of last year's price increase rate, Zou said that  it  reached the highest in December. The influence of this peak  will further decrease. Besides, he said the macro economic  situation has been improved.    During the five months this year, people's savings deposits  were 151.8 billion yuan up and the national revenue increased by  24.3 percent, compared with the same period of last year. The  investment in fixed assets has been brought under control. At  the same time, Zou said, the supply of and demand for many  important commodities have becomed more balanced.    Zou stressed that although the price increase rate will  gradually drop, the prices will remain relatively high for some  time. Therefore, he said, it is necessary to continue to  implement all the price-control measures to stabilize the prices  in order to create a better economic and social environment for  the reform and development.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUITY FUNDS LEAD PACK, BOND GROUPS LAG IN 3RD QUARTER  </P> <P> Mutual fund investors who stuck it out in some of the riskier segments of the  stock market reaped the biggest rewards in the third quarter. But those  investing in junk got junky returns.  </P> <P> The top-performing funds and fund groups in the period ended Sept. 30 were  those investing in international, growth, and health and technology stocks,  according to the latest survey of fund performance released Wednesday by Lipper  Analytical Services in Summit, N.J.  </P> <P> On the flip side, bond funds lagged, with those investing in high-yield junk  bonds among the worst.  </P> <P> "Income was not as desirable as growth in this quarter," said A. Michael  Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical.  </P> <P> Overall, general equity funds on average posted a 9.21% gain in the quarter.  That was lower than the gains of 10.70% and 11.54%, respectively, for Standard  &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial index, with dividends  reinvested. But it was far better than the average 3% quarterly rise for equity  funds during the past 10 years, Lipper said.  </P> <P> "This was just a good solid quarter for equity funds, a quarter that investors  can be very happy with," said Joe Mansueto, president of Morningstar Inc., a  Chicago firm that tracks mutual fund performance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cash Hoards a Drag  </P> <P> The strong performance of equity funds was not surprising, given that all major  stock indexes, including the Dow and S&amp;P 500, set all-time highs during the  quarter.  </P> <P> Equity funds under-performed the S&amp;P 500 and Dow in part because fund  managers -- fearing a possible correction -- held high cash positions. Those  cash hoards dragged down the funds' performance relative to the market indexes.  </P> <P> Health and biotechnology funds were the most impressive group, with a 16.68%  average gain for the quarter. International funds, aided by strong overseas  stock markets, came in second with a 13.79% average gain. They were followed by  global funds that invest in U.S. and overseas stocks (up 11.65%), science and  technology funds (up 10.29%) and growth funds that invest in companies with  strong earnings prospects (up 10.03%).  </P> <P> The top individual fund, up 30.64%, was Merrill Lynch Pacific A, a consistently  strong performer that also ranked No. 2 for the past five years. The fund --  which searches for undervalued stocks in Asian markets, particularly in Japan  -- was aided by gains of about 50% for each of its three top holdings, Fuji  Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, Nichido Fire &amp; Marine Insurance and Dai-Tokyo  Fire &amp; Marine Insurance, said portfolio manager Stephen I. Silverman. Each  outperformed the Japanese stock market, which in turn outperformed the U.S.  market, he said.  </P> <P> "We still think each is worth much more than they're selling for," Silverman  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Magellan Tops S&amp;P 500  </P> <P> (The Merrill Lynch Pacific B fund, whose portfolio is identical to the A fund,  ranked second with a 30.40% gain. The B version charges an annual sales and  marketing fee instead of a one-time sales charge, hence its lower annual  return.)  </P> <P> The third quarter was also another good period for industry superstar Peter  Lynch, whose Fidelity Magellan fund again beat the market averages with a  13.16% gain -- despite its lack of flexibility through being the nation's  largest stock fund.  </P> <P> "It's just incredible that he (Lynch) keeps outperforming on such a consistent  basis," analyst Mansueto said.  </P> <P> Magellan was the only one of the 10 largest stock funds to beat the S&amp;P  500. The second-biggest fund, Windsor, rose 8.54%, followed in size order by  Fidelity Equity Income (up 6.49%), Investment Co. of America (10.24%), Fidelity  Puritan (5.06%), Templeton World (10.20%), Pioneer II (7.37%), Affiliated  (8.00%), Washington Mutual Investors (9.43%) and Mutual Shares (5.76%).  </P> <P> The worst-performing group was fixed-income funds, posting a measly 0.56% gain.  These funds, which invest in bonds, were hurt by rising interest rates that  depressed prices of long-term bonds. The group also was dragged down by  declines in junk bond funds, ravaged by defaults that sunk the value of junk  issues, wiping out some or all of their high yields.  </P> <P> Most of the quarter's worst-performing individual funds were junk bond funds,  led by First Investors Bond Appreciation, which tumbled 7.99%.  </P> <P> What should investors do?  </P> <P> Many experts urge conservative investors to be wary of jumping headlong into  the quarter's top-performing groups. They are by nature volatile and could  easily be among the laggards in the current fourth quarter, Lipper said.  </P> <P> "The market is up so strongly this year that a flat quarter would be fine and  you'd still have a positive year," Mansueto added. "Investors should be very  satisfied with their gains this year and not get greedy and hope for more."  </P></p>

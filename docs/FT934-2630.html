			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Hub and spoke not to blame Sir, Your story, 'Dinosaurs on the runway' (December 8), reported that US airlines are questioning whether the hub-and-spoke concept is valid any more, and that this system is one of the reasons big carriers have incurred financial losses in contrast to small airlines which operate no-frills, shuttle service between pairs of cities and make money. This is not true at Delta Air Lines, originator of the hub-and-spoke system in aviation. Through the years we have continued to perfect the concept and today operate the most geographically balanced route network in the US. For Delta the hub-and-spoke system is the most efficient way of offering the most flights, to the most destinations, for our passengers and shippers, while maximising our assets. Last year, Delta was the only airline in the world to operate more than 1m departures. While many of these flights operated to or from one of our hubs, we have plenty of point-to-point flights where the market demands it, like the Delta Shuttle service between Washington, New York and Boston. The article stated that one of the big disadvantages of the hub-and-spoke system was that staff were standing idle during non-peak times throughout the day. In our Atlanta hub, the world's largest, we operate more than 500 flight departures every day and, like our other hubs, it is staffed according to the demand. No Delta staff stand idle; they are among the most competitive and flexible in the world. If there are dinosaurs, Delta is not one of them. Delta relishes change and that attitude will keep us around for a long time, providing value and superior service for our stockholders and passengers. Carriers in the US have lost money because of the recession, the Gulf War and the US bankruptcy law, not because of the hub-and-spoke system and small no-frills airlines.

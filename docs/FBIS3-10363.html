Gustavo Franco, director of the  Central Bank Foreign Department, said on 28 February that the  URV will be the Central Bank's dollar sale indicator. "If the  dollar reaches a specific value, which will be the URV, the  Central Bank will begin selling dollars," he explained. That  will be the basis of the exchange policy, which will keep the  dollar and the URV at the same value, preventing shifts between  both currencies.    Economic team members believe the level of Brazilian cash  reserves (immediately available) -- of $33 billion -- permits  implementation of the exchange policy.    Economic Policy Secretary Winston Fritsch said on 28  February  that "with such a reserve level, I do not think anyone should  challenge the Central Bank." In practice, the exchange level  will be coupled with the URV. "The exchange rate will follow the  URV," Finance Ministry Executive Secretary Clovis Carvalho has  said.    Central Bank President Pedro Malan denied that the dollar  has  been adjusted below inflation for the last five months. "This  has not happened with the IPC [consumer price index], the IGPM  [average general price index], and the IPCA [expanded consumer  price index], which are used for calculation of the URV," he  said. Malan blamed such reports on exporters.</p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> OFF THE RECORD  </P> <P> An article in Anthony Perry's "San Diego at Large" column Feb. 9 seems a  blatant violation of journalistic ethics. In his column, Perry notes that San  Diego Gas &amp; Electric President Tom Page met in an "off-the-record"  conversation with several reporters, and then goes on to describe the content  of Page's conversation.  </P> <P> Perry reports that "privately or publicly, Page does not deviate from the  company line," and then states that Page's "beleaguered body language and  verbal tics seemed to be saying something different."  </P> <P> I am amazed that The Times, certainly a reputable journalistic organ, would  print such information. It is a common journalistic practice that comments  during an off-the-record conversation may not be printed under any  circumstances. It would seem that facetious references to "body language" or  even "verbal tics" would be also unprintable.  </P> <P> As a reporter, I often encounter hesitancy and distrust from sources who have  been burned by unethical or careless journalists in the past. The Times should  be the last newspaper to perpetuate such distrust.  </P> <P> RANDY DOTINGA  </P> <P> Senior Staff Writer  </P> <P> The UC San Diego Guardian  </P> <P>  Editor's note: It was during an on-the-record portion of the meeting that Page  said his viewpoint on the SDG&amp;E merger is the same on or off the record.  </P></p>

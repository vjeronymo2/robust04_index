			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Brazilian private sector hit by high interest rates THE Brazilian private sector has been through its most difficult 12 months in the past decade as recession and high interest rates have eaten into profitability. The evaluation comes from the research group Tecnica Assessoria de Mercado de Capitais e Empresarial after a study of results for the first nine months of the year filed with Comissao de Valores Mobiliarios, Brazil's stock market watchdog. Of the 10 sectors analysed by the group, seven showed a decline in profits with airlines among those under most pressure. Although the airline industry boasted higher sales than the previous year, profits were hit by high interest rates as the sector staggered under the weight of heavy indebtedness. Losses for the sector in the first nine months of the year were Dollars 239m. The capital goods sector ran up a Dollars 60m loss over the period, while the car parts sector ended the period Dollars 81m in the red. Paper and cellulose companies were hit by a fall in domestic consumption and an overvalued cruzeiro, which cut into exports. Aracruz, the sector leader, suffered a loss of Dollars 47m for the period. The car sector also had a bad year. Price controls devastated profits for the first nine months of 1991. Since price ceilings were lifted a few months ago, huge price rises have allowed companies to recuperate some of their losses. Telebras, the state-owned telecommunications group, was the star of the Brazilian stock market this year thanks to keen interest on the part of foreign investors. The group, which has the highest market capitalisation in the country, forecast net profits of Dollars 1bn a few weeks ago. Later, the group changed the estimate to about Dollars 700m, after Dollars 300m was set aside for possible losses in an employee law suit against the group.</p>

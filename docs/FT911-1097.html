			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / The Blue Arrow Trial: County sought to avoid disclosure, court told - Court Report COUNTY NATWEST wanted to avoid disclosing in its year-end accounts the Blue Arrow holdings taken by advisers to the 1987 rights issue because of the stock market's ignorance of these holdings, the Blue Arrow trial was told yesterday. Mr James Riddell, a former County financial control director, agreed with Mr Nicholas Purnell, QC, prosecuting, that disclosure of the holdings taken in the September issue was the one thing everyone had tried to avoid. He agreed there was no alternative to the eventual disclosure of a 9.8 per cent holding made on December 17. The losses suffered in the stock market crash had to appear in some form in County's results. Mr Riddell was cross-examined by Mr Roy Amlot, QC, for Mr Alan Keat, a solicitor with Travers Smith Braithwaite who advised County, over discussions between the two men on the presentation of the losses in County's accounts. Mr Riddell agreed Mr Keat had expressed concern over a number of options being considered. Mr Keat had warned him disclosure would be necessary if some options were followed. If NatWest acquired the holdings of both County and County NatWest Securities, the aggregation rules of the Companies Act would apply. He said Mr Keat had advised him that, if NatWest gave CNWS a guarantee against losses on its holding, that would put into doubt the market makers' exemption from disclosure. He had said the written indemnity given to UBS Phillips &amp; Drew for its holding could not be extended because that would undermine its market makers' exemption. Mr Riddell said that Mr Keat had also expressed concern over the favoured option of transferring the stake held by County's corporate advisory division to the parent bank as a long-term trade investment. Mr Keat had advised that that depended on the intentions of NWB's directors and had agreed with Ernst and Whinney, the auditors, that such an option was not possible. He had considered Mr Keat's advice to have been honest throughout, Mr Riddell agreed County NatWest, NatWest Investment Bank, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew Securities and seven individuals deny conspiring to mislead the markets over the outcome of the Pounds 837m rights issue. The trial continues today.</p>

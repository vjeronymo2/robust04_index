			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Amman--The Jordanian National Front, which  includes the Jordanian National Alliance Party, the Progress and  Justice Party, al-Yaqazah Party, and al-Watan Party, have issued  a political statement on the U.S. position and Christopher's  tour. It says:    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher returned for a  new  tour of the Middle East after this region witnessed disgraceful  events between his current and previous tour. We also believe  he has no plan to end the region's grievances and sufferings, as  well as Israel's terrorism and tyranny.    As an example, we would like to mention the Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre and the killing of innocent worshipers in the mosque by  Israeli settlers, as well as the continued killing of the sons  of the Palestinian people. The United Nations has condemned  that terrorism and crime and stressed the need to find  international protection for the Palestinians, but the United  States voiced its biased reservations about some of the  provisions. [passage omitted]    We also demand that the unjust blockade, which the United  States has imposed on Iraq's people in order to plunder the oil  wealth in the region, undeterred by law or conscience, be lifted.    Regarding Jordan, we can say that despite the statements the  U.S. secretary of states made on several occasions that Jordan  is a friendly country and maintains cordial relations with his  country, the United States is still exercising, under UN cover,  these cordial relations with a blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, in  order to maintain the interests of its servants in the Arab  world and Israel and to harm Jordan's economic status. As some  media organizations say, the United States is dissatisfied with  democracy in Jordan because any attempt by neighboring Arab  countries to follow suit will threaten its servants' regimes.  Despite all this, the United States urges Jordan to continue  peace talks with Israel under the usual U.S. sponsorship of  peace conferences.</p>

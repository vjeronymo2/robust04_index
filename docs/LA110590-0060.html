			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LUGINBILL PLEASED, BUT HE'S LOOKING AHEAD  </P> <P> The film rolled along and the guys in black were looking sharp. Completing  passes, catching passes, making tackles, even intercepting two passes.  </P> <P> The coach sat in his chair with a remote control in his hand and a critic's  look on his face.  </P> <P> It was late Sunday afternoon, a day after San Diego State's 66-14 whipping of  Utah, and Coach Al Luginbill was watching film of his team's first victory  since late September.  </P> <P> It wasn't complete jubilation -- that's not the way football coaches work. No,  Hawaii comes to town next, and Luginbill stayed up late Saturday night scouting  the Rainbows' 43-16 victory over New Mexico. There is always another game,  another obstacle to keep the mind working one week ahead.  </P> <P> But for a few minutes Sunday, he didn't look ahead. He reflected on the Aztecs'  most dominating performance since they defeated UC Santa Barbara in 1970, 64-7.  He called it the best overall performance in his 19 games at SDSU.  </P> <P> "Our team played with an extreme amount of enthusiasm," Luginbill said. "From  the first snap to the last, they enjoyed playing the game of football. We never  got sloppy. That has not been the mode of operation here. In the last two years  when we've gotten comfortable, we have lowered our intensity, which lowered our  execution, which didn't make us look good."  </P> <P> The Aztecs (3-4, 2-2 in the Western Athletic Conference) had hit the skids late  in the game of each of their previous two victories this season. In a 38-21  victory over Cal State Long Beach, they had a 21-3 halftime lead before  becoming sluggish in the second half. The 49ers matched the Aztecs' 17  second-half points in that game. Two weeks later, SDSU led Air Force after  three quarters, 45-9, but got sloppy in the fourth quarter. The Aztecs ended up  winning, 48-18.  </P> <P> Saturday, however, SDSU was consistent throughout the game.  </P> <P> "I think our kids are sensitive to the fact that they're a pretty good football  team with nothing to show for it," Luginbill said. "Now, they're on a mission.  They have something to prove, and anybody who gets in their way is going to pay  dearly. Utah happened to be there."  </P> <P> The defense, which has collapsed frequently this season, turned in its best  performance of the year. SDSU held Utah to 200 yards in total offense, the  fewest allowed since SDSU held Brigham Young to 167 in 1986. Utah was the first  team that did not gain at least 300 yards against the Aztecs this season.  </P> <P> "It's a start for us," Luginbill said. "We're moving in the right direction as  a team. What I appreciate about the offensive kids is that all year, they have  really supported (the SDSU defense). It shows a type of character, empathy, or  whatever you want to call it, for their teammates. They compete against these  kids all week in practice and see how hard they try."  </P> <P> Luginbill got quite a bit of satisfaction from Saturday's victory, but it was  not enough to take his mind off this Saturday. There is always another game,  and more to accomplish.  </P> <P> After Saturday's game, Luginbill challenged the Aztecs to put together two  consecutive weeks of solid defense.  </P> <P> "The one thing we would like to see is to come out Saturday night with an  outstanding defensive performance, because it builds," Luginbill said.  </P> <P> Always planning, always plotting. But for a few brief moments, Luginbill  thought about his team's dominating performance over Utah, and he smiled.  </P> <P> Aztec Notes  </P> <P> SDSU's defense moved from 106th -- last -- to 103rd in Division I total  defense, allowing 465.1 yards a game. The Aztecs are 101st in scoring defense,  having allowed 36.1 points a game. SDSU ranks fourth in both passing offense  (333.9 yards a game) and scoring offense (41.3). Quarterback Dan McGwire is  third in the nation in passing efficiency (148.2), trailing Virginia's Shawn  Moore (166.4) and BYU's Ty Detmer (158.9). McGwire is fifth in total offense  (297.2). Patrick Rowe leads the nation in receiving yards per game (120.4) and  Dennis Arey is sixth (106).  </P> <P> SDSU's opponent next week, Hawaii (5-3, 2-2), pounded New Mexico, 43-16, late  Saturday behind Jamal Farmer's 115 rushing yards and three touchdowns. New  Mexico, the Aztecs' opponent Nov. 17, fell to 2-8, 1-4. Hawaii's defense forced  seven New Mexico turnovers. Linebacker Mark Odom led the Rainbow defense. He  had two sacks, two tackles for losses, an interception and a blocked extra  point in little more than three quarters. Odom was also in on eight tackles.  </P> <P> SDSU PASSERS  </P> <P> Top 10 career passers at San Diego State University:  </P> <P> Quarterback (Years): Yards  </P> <P> Todd Santos (1984-87): 11,425  </P> <P> Dan McGwire (1989-90): 5,800  </P> <P> Brian Sipe (1969-71): 5,707  </P> <P> Dennis Shaw (1968-69): 5,324  </P> <P> Mark Halda (1977-80): 4,812  </P> <P> Matt Kofler (1980-81): 4,476  </P> <P> Mark McKay (1982-83): 4,475  </P> <P> Craig Penrose (1974-75): 4,343  </P> <P> Jesse Freitas (1972-73): 4,193  </P> <P> Don Horn (1965-66): 3,922  </P></p>

Vasiliy Lipitskiy  already moved in one of the first parliament sessions that this  question be included on the agenda, but his motion was rejected.  In the opinion of Duma Deputy Ivan Anichkin, the failure of  Vasiliy Lipitskiy's first attempt to secure the release of the  Lefortovo prisoners is explained only by the lack of  coordination in the actions of the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia [LDPR] group of deputies, who voted against the proposal.  "But we will be able to agree on this question with  Zhirinovskiy," Ivan Anichkin thinks.</p>

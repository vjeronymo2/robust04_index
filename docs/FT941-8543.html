			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / London Stock Exchange: HTV bought Multi-media optimism boosted several television and publishing stocks after Flextech, the unlisted media investment concern, announced that it was putting Pounds 27m into HTV, the Welsh television group. Flextech highlighted its desire to expand into cable and satellite broadcasting and the news prompted investors to focus on Yorkshire Tyne Tees TV, which has a strong production record, and Pearson, owners of the Thames Television production company and library. Flextech rose 8 to 444p, HTV 27 to 152p, YTT 10 to 346p and Pearson 20 to 720p. Merchant bank Kleinwort Benson impressed the market with a 148 per cent jump in profits to Pounds 111.7m. But investors were concerned that the rise owed much to the surge in the stock market and might not be sustainable. The shares fell 20 to 632p. Securities house Smith New Court fell sharply after it was disclosed that a Pounds 10.7m award against Citibank for fraudulent misrepresentation in the sale of Ferranti shares had been cut by the court of appeal to Pounds 1.1m. The shares recovered to close 2 off at 466p. Smith said it would appeal the hearing. Far Eastern bank HSBC advanced 27 to 1019p after the Hong Kong stock market rebounded 1.4 per cent. The prospect of a 10 per cent rise in European glass prices helped to lift Pilkington by 5 to 201p. Turnover was a larger than usual 12m shares. The company confirmed the price increases yesterday, which are likely to equate to 6 per cent in the UK. Saint-Gobain, the French glass producer, has also recently announced price rises as both companies attempt to offset weak European demand. However, building analysts doubted whether the two leading glass producers could make the price rises stick. Sluggish building and car markets, particularly in Germany and France, are likely to undermine the latest moves. There is also overcapacity in the industry, which is thought likely to continue to depress prices. A good trading statement from Alfred McAlpine and figures at the top end of market forecasts saw the shares climb 30 to 329p. The news helped other construction groups. Higgs &amp; Hill put on 4 1/2 at 139p, John Mowlem 4 at 189p and Westbury 7 at 222p. Nervous textiles analysts were concerned over the delay in the sale of Hartstone's French hosiery business to Courtaulds Textiles, which was to have taken place yesterday. One of Hartstone's factories collapsed under the weight of heavy snow and the deal was postponed until the damage could be assessed. Sector experts say the Pounds 45.4m deal is good for Courtaulds Textiles (up a penny at 270p) but vital for Hartstone, which dipped 3 to 75p. Hartstone breached banking covenants last summer and has since narrowly escaped receivership. Fisons was a penny down at 132p. Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, lowered its rating on the pharmaceutical group's commercial paper, arguing that 'the potential for sustained, meaningful improvement in free cash flow appears limited'. Jitters before next week's full-year results saw British Aerospace relinquish 4 to 527p. Dealers also suggested that the stock was still reeling from Wednesday's news that Airbus Industrie, in which it has a 20 per cent stake, had lost out to its US rivals on a lucrative Dollars 6bn Saudi Arabian aircraft order. Turnover in BBA Group rose to a hefty 8.4m, with Credit Lyonnais Laing said to have been the day's big player, attracting both the buyers and the sellers. The shares gained 4 at 224p. Firm aluminium prices boosted metals group Johnson Matthey, 3 higher at 595p. GKN firmed 2 to 562p as it posted its offer document for its bid target Westland Group, a penny lighter at 332p. GKN once again stated it was making a fair offer for Westland. Conglomerate Lonrho eased 3 1/2 to 160 1/2 p after the company confirmed market speculation that it was to issue a Pounds 64.5m convertible bond to mature in the year 2004. Dealers reported several crosses in McKechnie, where a line of stock had been on offer early in the day. The shares were eventually 5 1/2 ahead at 527 1/2 p. General investment buying helped Vosper Thornycroft advance 15 to 772p. Charterhouse Tilney continues to favour the stock. In transports, Associated British Ports gained strength, finishing 6 ahead at 622p, after Smith New Court reiterated its buy recommendation. In Shops agreed terms from Birkby in a deal valuing the retail space letting group at Pounds 58m and each In Shops share at 110p. The offer is being made on the basis of five new Birkby shares for every 12 In Shops shares. In Shops shot forward on the news, closing 30 stronger at 113p. Birkby finished 13 up at 278p. New arrival Clinical Computer started trading at a healthy premium to its 124p issue price. The shares opened at 150p and closed at 173p, with a new issue investment fund said to be an active buyer.

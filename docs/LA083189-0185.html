			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYFRIEND OF SLAIN WOMAN FREED AFTER LAB TESTS SHOW HIM INNOCENT  </P> <P> The boyfriend of Denise Marie Duerr was cleared of murder charges Wednesday  after laboratory and lie detector tests demonstrated he was not involved in the  brutal stabbing death of the 21-year-old Garden Grove woman, a Riverside County  deputy district attorney said.  </P> <P> Robert Clyde Spontak, 22, of Garden Grove, was released late Wednesday from  Riverside County Jail, where he had been held since April.  </P> <P> Spontak, who emerged from the jail about 8:20 p.m. wearing a purple sweat shirt  and neon green shorts, said he was happy to be free and that he had spent many  hours thinking about Duerr.  </P> <P> "It was such a nightmare, I could never have had such a bad dream," said  Spontak, who had wept before television cameras as he proclaimed his innocence  in the days following Duerr's death.  </P> <P> Spontak, who said he plans to return to Orange County and seek work, added,  "I'd spend the rest of my life in jail if I could get her back."  </P> <P> Early Wednesday, his attorney, Thomas Brown of Westminster, said, "It's been a  long haul. . . . He (Spontak) really is very concerned that the person who did  this be punished."  </P> <P> Investigators now believe Cameron Charles Seaholm, 22, a high school classmate  of the couple who also was charged in Duerr's murder, is responsible for the  crime, Deputy Dist. Atty. Daniel C. Lough said.  </P> <P> Seaholm is accused of stabbing Duerr about 20 times with an ice pick, wrapping  her body in a sheet, putting her in the trunk of her car and dumping her in the  hills near Corona, Lough said. Seaholm remains in custody in Riverside County.  </P> <P> Seaholm, a drifter who sometimes stayed in the apartment shared by Duerr and  Spontak, told police he stole Duerr's 1984 Fiero while high on cocaine and  discovered her body in the trunk after the car got a flat tire. Seaholm  admitted to dumping the victim's partially decomposed body, but insisted he was  not involved in her slaying.  </P> <P> Gary L. Proctor, Seaholm's lawyer in Santa Ana, did not return calls seeking  comment.  </P> <P> Wednesday's developments in the case provided little comfort to the Duerr  family, some of whom expressed doubts about Spontak's innocence.  </P> <P> "I still don't know," said Ronald Ducharme, Duerr's stepfather. "It doesn't  bring the kid back."  </P> <P> Joseph Duerr, Denise Duerr's uncle and manager of the electronics store where  she had worked, said he is taking a "wait-and-see" attitude.  </P> <P> "If he's guilty of nothing else, he's guilty of having Denise in that  environment that caused the whole thing," Duerr said of Spontak. "I don't plan  on having any contact with him at all."  </P> <P> In fact, "that environment" was responsible for the delay in dropping charges  against Spontak, Lough said.  </P> <P> Police initially believed that arguments between Duerr and Spontak over his  suspected drug dealing led to her death. Spontak had lied to authorities about  his whereabouts at the time of Duerr's death, leading to his arrest, Lough  said. Investigators also linked Spontak to the crime because Duerr is believed  to have been killed in the garage of the apartment shared by the couple.  </P> <P> "I believe (Riverside County Sheriff's deputies) had probable cause to arrest  him and I still believe that," Lough said.  </P> <P> But after a few months in jail, Spontak provided investigators with another  account that was verified by neighbors and other acquaintances, Lough said.  </P> <P> "He gave us chapter and verse and explained why he had lied to us," said Lough,  who declined to provide details of Spontak's subsequent account except to say  that investigators were able to confirm his information.  </P> <P> Spontak "wasn't in a position to explain his whereabouts because of his other  criminal activity."  </P> <P> Seaholm told investigators that he and Spontak had planned to sell about a  half-pound of cocaine about the time of the killing.  </P> <P> Brown agreed that if his client "had gotten his story straight in the  beginning, I don't think he would have been taken into custody."  </P> <P> Spontak also passed a lie detector test, Lough said.  </P> <P> "I would never act upon that independently. . . . But it did contribute to" the  charges bring dropped, Lough said.  </P> <P> While investigators were working to verify Spontak's new account, laboratory  tests were under way on bloodstained sheets and other physical evidence from  the crime. The tests revealed the presence of body fluids other than Spontak's  on Duerr's body.  </P> <P> A pretrial hearing for Seaholm, who has pleaded innocent, is scheduled for  Sept. 25.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Thomas Becher contributed to this story.  </P></p>

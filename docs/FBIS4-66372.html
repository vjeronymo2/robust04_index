			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Chang Weimin: "Ups and Downs Noted for Crude-Oil </F> Output"]    [Text] Production of crude oil increased at several major  oilfields but declined at others in this year's first quarter.    Latest statistics show that Daqing, China's largest  oilfield,  pumped 13.86 million tons in the period from January through  March--100,000 tons more than in the same period last year.    Daqing, whose output accounts for 40 percent of China's  total, will maintain annual production at more than 56 million  tons at least until 1995, and 50 million tons through the year  2000.    Chinese onshore oilfields produced 139 million tons of oil  last year.    In the first quarter of this year, the onshore oilfields  produced 34.33 million tons, up 0.58 percent over the same  period last year.    Output of the Liaohe, Xinjiang and Dagang oilfields during  the first quarter were, respectively, 3.6 million tons, up 5.4  percent; 1.95 million tons, up 10.4 percent; and 1.04 million  tons, up 4.1 percent.    However, production at some other major oilfields dropped as  expected. Most of the country's oilfields, concentrated in  Northeast and Central China, have been exploited for decades.    A senior official from the China National Petroleum  Corporation (CNPC) says he is confident production at the old  oilfields can be maintained. Onshore oil production for this  year is expected to be 140 million tons.    The official said measures will be taken to stabilize or  even  increase production.    CNPC, the country's largest oil firm, intends to beef up  investment and technology development in East China, with  approval from the central government.    Old oilfields in this region are expected to be the pillar  of  the country's petroleum industry until at least the year 2000.  CNPC's goal is to keep annual production in the East at more  than 124 million tons, the official said.    East China reports progress in discovering new oil reserves  and working out techniques to exploit heavy-oil reserves and  oilfields where geological conditions are used to limit  production.    In addition, equipment and expertise to develop shallow  offshore waters on the continental shelf have been worked out.    While trying every means to stabilize production in the old  oilfields, CNPC will accelerate exploration and development in  the Tarim, Turpan-Hami and Junggar basins in West China's  Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Billions of tons of oil  reserves in the region are expected to benefit by the national  economy in the next century.</p>

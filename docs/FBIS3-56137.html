The movement warned the  president that since the government was being cut primarily at  the expense of the reform-minded wing, "a real threat looms over  reform yet another time." "In the emerging situation we have to  warn you that Democratic Russia, true to its principled views,  will have to reconsider the question of its support for the  course pursued by the president and the government," said the  letter signed by the movement's cochairmen, Lev Ponomarev and  Gleb Yakunin.</p>

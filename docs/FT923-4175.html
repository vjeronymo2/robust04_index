			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Premier league sponsorship row SEVEN MEMBERS of the new premier league, the top English football division, walked out of a meeting of the clubs yesterday after a Pounds 13m sponsorship deal with Bass, the brewer, had been blocked. Eight of the league's 22 clubs had voted against accepting the deal because they felt it might conflict with their own sponsorships by brewers. The seven clubs which walked out argued that the action by the eight was against the interests of the Premier League as a whole. Fourteen clubs voted to accept the deal - one less than the 15 votes needed to carry the motion. Mr Rick Parry, Premier League chief executive, said he did not expect Bass to pursue sponsoring the league. The GM Vauxhall Conference yesterday signed a one-year sponsorship agreement with the Health Education Authority for the Bob Lord Challenge Trophy, which will become known as the Drinkwise Cup, named after the authority's campaign to promote sensible consumption of alcohol.</p>

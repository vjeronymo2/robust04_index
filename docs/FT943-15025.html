			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Hurd issues plea over EU entrants Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, appealed to Tory Euro-sceptics in the Commons last night not to oppose the bill enabling Britain to agree the entry of Sweden, Finland, Norway and Austria into the European Union. He said that if their fears that the new entrants would boost the development of the EU's social dimension proved well-founded, it would increase the value of Britain's opt-out from the relevant section of the Maastricht treaty. Mr Hurd urged the Euro-sceptics not to start opposing enlargement of the EU 'simply because we do not always agree with all the views of those who come in'. He stressed that as Sweden, Austria and Norway would be net contributors to the EU's budget, they would share Britain's interests in budgetary discipline and value for money. Mr Hurd also emphasised that as a result of the additional number of net contributors it was expected that the UK's contribution would be some Pounds 300m less during the first six years of accession than it would otherwise have been. Other favourable factors included the benefit to Britain's agricultural exports through the opening of the previously protected markets of the four applicant countries. Producers of offshore supplies for the oil industry would benefit from Norway's acceptance of EU rules, he said. Mr Hurd forecast that overall British business would benefit 'not hugely but significantly' from enlargement of the EU. He also looked to the entrants to support the UK's drive for vigorous application of 'subsidiarity' - ensuring that where possible decisions are made at national level. The European Union (Accessions) bill was given an unopposed second reading.</p>

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Smith is given more applause than Tories MR JOHN SMITH, leader of the Opposition, won more applause at the conference than any of the cabinet ministers who preceded him to the speakers' podium. Short of some party political knockabout and a defence of Labour attitudes to the European Union's social chapter, the speech could have been written inside the CBI itself or at the Engineering Employers Federation. But CBI delegates were not convinced that the applause signalled approbation, in spite of the unity of approach. Rather, said one informally, it was a gesture of courtesy to Mr Smith for walking into the lion's den. Still, just as the cabinet ministers had been, he was solid on Europe. As Mr Edward Heath, the chairman of Heath Springs, the Midlands components maker, said: 'That's where the opportunities are.' Attitudes to Europe were a recurrent conference theme. What delegates heard pleased Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity. 'It's clarified the issues outstanding,' he said. Referring to Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, Mr Townsend, who is chairman of the CBI regional council, added that 'his definition of European Union coincides with the views we get from our members in the West Midlands'. The greater degree of confidence in the conference hall spread into the corridors. Partly this came from what delegates heard from the government - and indeed from Mr Smith - about the importance of manufacturing. The industrialists feel wanted. This feeling of relative harmony with the government extended to the other clear theme of the conference, the pace of economic recovery. There was even a degree of good cheer. Mr Jeremy Woolridge, chairman of BE Wedge Holdings, the Black Country engineering company, said: 'It's more cheerful than a year ago. The big thing that is encouraging is Kenneth Clarke's recognition of the fragile recovery, that we get a Budget which is not unfriendly.' Mr Townsend agreed. 'I'm more confident now we won't get a Budget which is hostile to industry.'</p>

			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Monetarist sees drop in tax revenue under Smith LABOUR'S plans to increase sharply the income tax and National Insurance burden of middle managers could lead to a significant drop in national income and tax revenue, according to Professor Patrick Minford, the monetarist economist. Applying econometric analysis to the behaviour of 7,000 male workers covered by the government's general household survey, Prof Minford concluded that Labour's plans could lead to a drop in national income of between 2.1 per cent and 2.5 per cent a year and a loss in tax revenue of between Pounds 7bn and Pounds 8bn. Prof Minford said Labour's tax plans, unveiled by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, would have a considerable disincentive effect on higher income groups. He said workers in the top fifth of the income scale - broadly the group earning more than Pounds 21,060 a year - would reduce their work effort by 12 per cent under Labour if their gross wages were held constant. Those in the top tenth - earning more than Pounds 32,000 a year - would cut work effort by 8 per cent while those in the top twentieth on more than Pounds 50,000 would reduce work effort by 4.5 per cent. The annual loss in terms of economic production would be Pounds 13.7bn or about 2.1 per cent of national income. Prof Minford warned that the output effects of Labour's plans would begin almost at once. 'By abolishing the National Insurance ceiling Labour would bring 3m moderate, yet highly productive, earners into a sharply higher marginal tax band. If the general household survey is to be believed, they will reallocate their activities dramatically over the longer run, to the severe detriment of the economy.' He said the negative effects on the economy would be greater if companies restored workers' pay to offset the impact of the tax increases. There would be a general rise in company costs, increased unemployment and a 2.5 per cent loss of output. The Institute of Directors has compared the manifestos of the three main parties with its own programme published last month. It finds that Conservative policies score 40 positive points against three negative, while Labour scores 21 positive points against 25 negative, and the Liberal Democrats 36 against 22. The Chemical Industry Association has called on all three main political parties to commit themselves to the creation of open trading conditions free from protectionism and competitive distortions.

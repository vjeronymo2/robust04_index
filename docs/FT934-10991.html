			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Yaohan expands in China YAOHAN, a Japanese retailing group, plans to set up a big computerised distribution centre in Beijing with the Chinese government, to be completed in 1995. Mr Kazuo Wada, Yaohan's chairman, who moved the group's headquarters to Hong Kong in 1990, said the plan was part of his strategy of establishing production, distribution and retail networks throughout China. Yaohan, which has 432 stores worldwide, became the first foreign retailer to set up shop in China, opening department stores in Shenzhen and Beijing in 1991. It is also building a shopping centre with floor space of 108,000 sq m in Pudong, the special economic zone near Shanghai, to completed in 1995. 'China lacks proper wholesaling and distributing systems. It takes two to three months to replace a product after it has been sold,' said Mr Wada. He plans to set up distribution centres in 10 provinces, and wants to open 1,000 supermarkets in China by the year 2010. Mr Wada reckons that the true purchasing ability of Chinese living in large cities is not reflected in the official statistics. Although the national average annual income is considered to be about Dollars 350 (Pounds 232) per person, 'In Shanghai it's about Dollars 2,000 and in Shenzhen about Dollars 3,000,' he said. Rockwell International, the US automotive-to-aerospace multinational, is setting up a joint venture in China to develop and make a range of car body components for the fast-expanding Chinese vehicle industry, John Griffiths writes. The venture, in which Rockwell will have a majority stake, is with Zhenjiang General Equipment Factory, based about 200 miles from Shanghai. It will operate under the name of Rockwell Chassis and Body System Zhenjiang Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Rockwell will supply technology, processing equipment, systems and management expertise - as well as an undisclosed amount of investment capital - for the production of window regulators, door latches, handbrakes and similar products. Rockwell has been active in China since the 1970s. 'The venture reflects Rockwell's overall strategy for investment in China, where there is a huge potential for passenger car growth,' according to Mr Donald Beall, its chairman and chief executive. Rockwell already exports to China heavy-duty axles and brakes and components for off-highway construction equipment, avionics, telecommunications and automation equipment and printing presses. Several of its existing motor industry customers, including Peugeot of France, are either starting up of expanding car production in China.</p>

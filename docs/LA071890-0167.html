			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SIDELINES;  </P> <P> MISSOURI'S COACH DENIES GIVING FALSE MATERIAL TO NCAA PROBERS  </P> <P> University of Missouri Coach Norm Stewart denied today that he had provided  false or misleading information to NCAA investigators looking into alleged  wrongdoing in the school's basketball program.  </P> <P> "I intend to contest the NCAA's recent allegation at every stage of the  proceeding," Stewart said in a nine-page statement distributed before his  Kansas City news conference.  </P> <P> "During my 33 years of coaching I have never been connected with an NCAA  rules-infraction case until this one," Stewart said.  </P> <P> Stewart said almost all the allegations in the letter of inquiry issued in May  by the NCAA were attributable to four individuals and their families or  friends.  </P> <P> "Each one of these four individuals has publicly expressed a bias against the  university and the coach, and each one of these individuals has a motive to  fabricate or to at least embellish the facts," he said in his statement.  </P> <P> "For several of the allegations, however, the evidence boils down to a conflict  of testimony between disgruntled individuals, who have a motive to lie, on the  one hand and a coaching staff on the other hand.  </P> <P> "My coaching staff has been in good standing for over seven decades  collectively," he said. "For those allegations where the evidence boils down to  us versus them I feel the question should be resolved in favor of the coaching  staff."  </P></p>

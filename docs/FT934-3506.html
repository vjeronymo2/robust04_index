			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / International Company News: Strong sales at Deere lift pre-charge profits Fourth-quarter earnings at Deere and Company, the US agricultural, industrial and lawn equipment manufacturer, jumped to Dollars 103.5m, or Dollars 1.33 a share, in the fourth quarter, before special accounting charges. Deere said strong North American sales in all equipment lines boosted profits. Last year the group recorded fourth-quarter profits of Dollars 4.2m, or 5 cents. Before special charges, Deere posted full-year income of Dollars 286.3m, or Dollars 3.70 a share, up from Dollars 37.4m, or 49 cents, a year ago. Including the special charges, it suffered a net loss of Dollars 920.9m, or Dollars 11.91, in fiscal 1993. Those charges included a one-time accounting charge of Dollars 1.1bn for post-retirement employee benefits. Despite the Dollars 80m restructuring of its European operations, announced in the second quarter, overseas agricultural equipment operations incurred significant operating losses in the fourth quarter and for fiscal 1993. The full-year's losses 'substantially exceeded' last year's operating loss. Deere's worldwide sales jumped 15 per cent to Dollars 2.18bn in the fourth quarter, from Dollars 1.9bn in the same 1992 quarter. Production tonnage was up 31 per cent from last year's fourth quarter, when Deere shut down some of its factories to limit the build-up of inventories. For the fiscal year, Deere reported worldwide sales of Dollars 7.75bn, up 11 per cent from 1992's Dollars 6.96bn. North American equipment sales made up Dollars 4.9bn of that total, up 19 per cent from last year. Mr Hans Becherer, chairman, said North American sales of agricultural equipment in 1994 should reach 1993 levels. 'Due to the lower 1993 grain production and the resulting reduction in carry-over stocks, a substantial increase in planted and harvested acreage of corn and soya beans is expected in 1994,' he said.</p>

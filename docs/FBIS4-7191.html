			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 28 KYODO -- Newly appointed Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa is head of the new party "Jiyuto"  (Liberal Party), a coalition bloc, and is credited for his  expertise in financial and foreign affairs. Kakizawa, 60,  replaced Tsutomu Hata in the post, the latter having been  elected as prime minister.    Conversant in both English and French, he has demonstrated  great interest in foreign affairs, having served as chairman of  the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee in 1990  and as parliamentary vice foreign minister from 1991 to 1993  under then Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.    During that latter stint, he visited Mozambique to pave the  way for deployment of Japanese U.N. peacekeepers there, while he  represented Japan at a meeting of the Association of Southeast  Asian Nations (ASEAN) post-ministerial conference. He has shown  a particular interest in Myanmar [Burma], having visited the  country and met with top junta leaders.    After graduating from Tokyo University, Kakizawa served for  years as a Finance Ministry bureaucrat and spent time as an  intern at the French Finance Ministry in Paris and a diplomat at  the Japanese Embassy in Belgium. He ended his career as a  bureaucrat in 1977 when he successfully ran for a seat in the  House of Councillors as a candidate for the new Liberal Club, a  splinter party from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).    In 1980, he was elected to the first of five terms in the  House of Representatives. The following year he left the new  Liberal Club, which disbanded in 1986, all of its former members  rejoining the LDP.    After joining the LDP, he belonged to a faction led by  former  Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe and worked on foreign, defense  and financial affairs.    Kakizawa launched the Liberal Party on April 20 along with  five other LDP defectors and one independent amid the political  turmoil sparked by the declaration of former Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa on April 8 that he would resign.    Kakizawa, hailing from Tokyo's No. 6 constituency, has been  elected to the lower house five times.</p>

			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Japan scales down ambitions at UN: Campaign for seat may divide coalition JAPAN will tone down its campaign for a permanent seat on the UN Security Council when Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the prime minister, addresses the UN General Assembly next Monday. He is expected to avoid mentioning security council membership, in a speech he is due to make before the assembly. This, the latest issue to cause divisions in Japan's seven-party coalition, indicates that the coalition could find it hard to stick to its pledge to pursue the same foreign policy that of as the previous LDP government. However, in a demonstration of support for UN peacekeeping operations, Tokyo will make a Dollars 196m (Pounds 127m) contribution to the peacekeeping budget, said officials. The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition partner, argues that sending troops overseas contravenes article nine of Japan's constitution, which renounces military force to settle international conflicts. At the other extreme, the Japan Renewal party of Mr Ichiro Ozawa, the main powerbroker behind the government, believes Japanese troops should take an increasing part in UN peacekeeping, in line with the country's attempts to take a more prominent part in international affairs. The issue has been been in the public eye during the past week, with the return home of Japanese peacekeepers from Cambodia, at the end of their six-month mission. Mr Hosokawa, who has avoided taking sides in this, will restrict himself to stressing that Japan will do all it can to support UN reform so as to pursue peace in the post-cold war era, said officials. This is cautious by comparison with a Japanese official position paper, sent to the UN secretariat in July, in which Tokyo offers to assume all security council duties necessary. Mr Hosokawa is prepared to compromise with the SDP because the government's top priorities are the reform of Japan's political system - the main item of business on a 90-day extraordinary parliamentary session which began last week - and measures to revive the flagging economy.</p>

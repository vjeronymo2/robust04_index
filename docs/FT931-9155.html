			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / Inflation gap between sectors expected to close THE STRUCTURE of inflation in Britain is expected to change in the future after sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism with the gap between goods and service inflation narrowing, the Bank of England said yesterday. In an article released in advance of publication of its quarterly bulletin today, the Bank said annual retail price inflation was about 3 percentage points higher in the service sector than in the goods sector last year after being about 2 percentage points higher on average since the early 1980s. Divergence in the components of inflation has been a matter of concern at the Bank in the past. Yesterday's article said that faster productivity growth in manufacturing explained much of the gap. A further explanation might be that the recession had had a bigger impact in suppressing goods' inflation. The Bank said the gap had followed a regular pattern through the 1980s, peaking about every two years. It had often been at its largest when sterling's real exchange rate was at its peak, as in 1980-81, 1988 and 1991-92. After studying the period between 1989 and the present, it concluded that foreign competition, combined with British membership of the European exchange rate mechanism had exercised a powerful restraint on traded-goods inflation. The Bank said the ERM restrained price rises 'in so far as it led to an exchange rate higher than it would otherwise have been'. By causing price setters to expect a fixed exchange rate, the ERM may also have encouraged them to set prices lower than they otherwise would have done. Price increases of 5 per cent to 10 per cent across a range of food products were predicted yesterday by the chairman of Dalgety, which supplies the start of the food chain through animal feed and flour. Mr Maurice Warren said post-devaluation increases in raw material costs were being passed on to farmers and food manufacturers. 'We supply the start of the chain with animal feed,' he said. Price increases of 15 per cent to 20 per cent had been pushed through since last October. Animal feed was particularly vulnerable because raw materials accounted for 80 per cent of production costs.</p>

			<p>Seemingly      anxious that Russia is attempting to increase its  influence in the region, Polish and Czech leaders have expressed  concern about new Russian terms for participating in NATO's  Partnership for Peace.  On the eve of a meeting of seven Central  European presidents in Litomysl, Czech Republic, Polish President  Lech Walesa likened Russian conditions for joining PFP to the  1945 Yalta agreement, warning in an interview that a new NATO  with a strong Russian role could "push America out of Europe" and  "create the United States of Russia" (Prague radio, 13 April).  Repeating his concerns during a debate televised by Prague TV at  the conference, Walesa contended that Russia does not want to be  a "real partner, the meaning of which they do not understand."  Czech President Vaclav Havel echoed this sentiment at the  meeting, saying that Russia "ought not claim superpower status on  the one hand, while at the same time enjoying the same rights as  the small Central European countries."  Havel added that "some  ideas now emerging in Russian politics should be really sharply  criticized and denounced," particularly the view that "just  because Russia is such a big state, it kind of owns us and  automatically enjoys the right to advise us." During the same  discussion, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz and Slovak President  Michal Kovac did not express similar concerns.      Even before Russia suggested that new terms would be required for  their participation in NATO, both Walesa and Havel were strongly  critical of Russia's position on NATO expansion, particularly  since Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed reservations  about East Europe's admission in December (Trends of 5 January,  pages 1-7).  Yeltsin said in a letter to NATO members that he  viewed East European efforts to join NATO with "alarm" (Mlada  Fronta Dnes, 2 December), while Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev  told Czech journalists that NATO expansion without Russia "does  not suit us" (Rude Pravo, 29 November).  Responding to this  position in a 25 February Warsaw radio interview, Walesa said  that although East Europe is "now forgiving" Russia for its past  domination of the region, Russia "wants us again in its embrace."  He warned that "yesterday it was our grandfathers" who suffered  under the Russians "and tomorrow it will be you" unless "the  whole of Europe says, 'Is Poland free, Mister Kozyrev? Is it  entitled to make independent decisions? What business is it of  yours?'"  Havel also rebuked the Russians, saying on a trip to  Rome that "Russia cannot decide on our behalf which international  organizations we can or cannot join" (RAI TV, 7 March).  In an  interview with a French journalist, Havel sought to explain  recent shifts in Russian policy by noting that "there is a sort  of nostalgia appearing in Russian society for the time when the  nation was a great power with a wide scope of influence" (Le  Point, 12 March).

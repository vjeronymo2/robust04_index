			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: CAREFUL CONSULTATION NEEDED IN PLANNING ONE'S OWN DEATH  </P> <P> Question: A long time ago, you discussed managing one's own dying. What peace  of mind I would have if I could plan for my own death, when the time comes that  my cancer has progressed and I can no longer stand the pain or care for myself.  Would you please print the address for the Hemlock Society again, so I can  contact them?  </P> <P> Answer: The decision you contemplate is an intensely personal one. Needless to  say, no one should take such an irrevocable step without careful consultation  with a physician, clergyman or family member.  </P> <P> Pain can be managed successfully at home or in the hospital with a number of  effective analgesics. We also suggest you contact your local hospice  organization.  </P> <P> If you would like more information about the National Hemlock Society, you can  contact it at P.O. Box 11830, Eugene, Ore., 97440-3900.  </P> <P> Q: Can allergy medicine cause insomnia? I thought antihistamines make you  drowsy but ever since I started taking Sudafed, I have had trouble falling  asleep.  </P> <P> A: Although you are correct that over-the-counter antihistamines often cause  sedation, Sudafed (pseudoephedrine) is not an antihistamine. This decongestant  is capable of causing nervous system stimulation and insomnia.  </P> <P> To avoid this problem, don't take such products in the late afternoon or  evening.  </P> <P> Q: Can magnesium prevent kidney stones? I never want to experience that  excruciating pain again.  </P> <P> A: There is some evidence that magnesium (200 to 300 milligrams a day) may be  beneficial in preventing calcium oxalate stones.  </P> <P> Q: There is a history of breast cancer in my family so I am automatically at  high risk. I am worried about osteoporosis, but I don't want to take estrogen  hormones for fear of breast cancer.  </P> <P> I've heard about a new medicine, but my doctor doesn't know what I'm talking  about. Can you tell me where to go for more information?  </P> <P> A: The medication you refer to is Didronel (etidronate). Have your doctor read  an article in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Nelson B. Watts (July  12, 1990, Vol. 323, Pages 73-79).  </P></p>

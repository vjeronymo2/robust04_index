			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Francesco La Licata: "Watch Out for the </F> 'Ndrangheta"]    [Text] The minister says: "an army of 5,000 men." The  investigators say: "It has now become a single entity with the  Sicilian families and has reached international proportions."  Connections with the Masonic lodges.    Rome--According to the repeated testimony of informers over  a  number of months, Cosa Nostra has almost completely absorbed the  Calabrian Mafia, in the sense that they "have become one and the  same thing." This is not a new phenomenon. Just think back to  the late 1970's. When boss Gaetano Badalamenti started to fear  his life was in danger, he went to Aspromonte to find "anonymous  killers" to fight the mob families from Corleone. So, even  though this revival of 'Ndrangheta infamy represents nothing  new, it is still very worrisome to government investigators. The  Calabrian alarm was sounded in the biannual report the DIA  [Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate] presented by Minister  Mancino to Parliament. It took 39 pages chock-full of numbers,  analyses, forecasts, and warnings to say that the menace of this  criminal connection--which has perhaps been slightly  underestimated because it was subconsciously relegated to the  background by the more sensational acts of Cosa Nostra--has  reached "international proportions."    'Ndrangheta can count on 155 clans, which means about 5,000  men spread throughout the territory with powerful branches in  some Italian regions, primarily Lombardy and Piedmont, and even  in Europe, the United States, and Australia. For years, the  "Santa" [something holy] (which is what they call the Mafia in  Calabria) has been able to extend itself, branch out, and  fortify itself until it was able to infiltrate politics and the  economy. How? By making good use of the formidable vehicle of  Freemasonry. According to the report of Gianni De Gennaro, DIA  director, the Masonic lodges are allegedly "an important loop in  connecting the Mafia with politics." It is significant that  one-third of all Southern Masons come from Calabria. "There are  twice as many Masons in Calabria as there are in Sicily and six  times as many as in Campania."    How does the 'Ndrangheta support itself? Its main line of  business is extortions and the trafficking of narcotics. Then  comes kidnaping which, although it is still practiced, seems to  have been "delegated" to the mob gangs of the hinterland, the  bosses in the "Aspromonte mountains, which are used as a huge  prison for kidnaped victims."    Protection money has become such an integral part of the  "normal conduct of business" that it is no longer reported. And  the victims are often hit twice--first by the Mafia and then by  the usurers who always operate under the protection of the  godfathers.    But drugs are the inexhaustible lifeline. Cocaine traffic  seems to have become the prerogative of the Calabrians who also  have substantial bases of operations to control its use in the  large cities in the North. The DIA carried out two missions  (called "Siderno Group" and "North-South") that provided an  exact picture of the extent to which the Calabrian Mafia has  taken root in Piedmont and Lombardy as well as in Romagna,  Lazio, and Liguria. It is from Liguria that they control the  activities of important gambling casinos like those in Nice and  Menton. According to the DIA, some of the major bases of  operations include those in Susa, Bardonecchia, Volpiano,  Rivarolo, and Cirie--which are near Turin--while the city itself  is controlled by the Belfiore gang. Not even the Valle d'Aosta,  with its Nirta gang, is immune to the epidemic.    The synergy between 'Ndrangheta and Cosa Nostra is  especially  alarming. It has been shown that the Calabrian bosses have been  practically absorbed into the Sicilian "cupola," or dome of  leadership, as true Mafia men of honor. The most obvious proof  of this is the assassination of Cassation Court Judge Antonino  Scopelliti. It was an assassination that was ordered by Toto  Riina and carried out by Calabrian "soldiers" in their own  territory. The death of the attorney general who had been  assigned to argue the state's case in the first maxi-trial of  Palermo was meant to slow everything down and cause the  deadlines for precautionary custody to elapse for the Sicilian  bosses who had been sentenced to jail in the first trial and on  appeal. The informers say the exchange of favors took place.</p>

			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / Heseltine to explore EC coal options MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, will travel to Brussels tomorrow to explore options with EC officials for rescuing British Coal. High on his agenda will be ways of subsidising British Coal to enable it to compete with coal imports and other types of fuel. Mr Heseltine will be seeing Mr Karel Van Miert, the new competition commissioner, whose responsibilities include state aid to industry. The UK gives the maximum support to its energy industry allowed under EC policy. It is not clear whether that limit, based on informal agreements, still holds after the appointment of a new commission on January 1. Mr Heseltine has already decided against banning imports of French electricity to take the pressure off British Coal. That remedy is thought to be too complicated, given the launch this year of the single EC market and the existence of long-term commercial contracts. Mr John Major, the prime minister, met Mr Heseltine yesterday to discuss the coal energy review but Downing Street said discussions were at a preliminary stage. British diplomats in Brussels said yesterday Mr Heseltine's visit was aimed at establishing first contacts with new commissioners in his field - principally Mr Abel Matutes, responsible for energy and transport, and Mr Van Miert. They confirmed that one of the principal subjects under discussion will be how to soften the blow of pit closures in the UK through subsidies, perhaps paid for by a levy imposed on consumers' electricity bills. The commission's revised code for state aid to the EC coal industry, yet to be adopted by member states, aims to tighten the screw on inefficient mines in Spain and Germany. Under the code, which should come into force in 1994, Britain would be under no obligation to cut costs at its mines, which are already the most efficient in the EC. Leaders of the coal and rail unions dropped their demand yesterday for a 'stay away' day of action for January 19 to protest against the planned pit closures. After a meeting at TUC headquarters in London they said it was 'inappropriate' to go ahead with the day's protest given the High Court ruling against 'immediate closure' of 10 of the 31 threatened pits. The unions went on to call for a day of action next month in protest at the plans.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Decision makers will be especially challenged by the growing numbers of two different generational segments of our aging population: (1) Older persons at risk of losing their independence and; (2) the baby-boom generation_a cohort of more than 70 million individuals born between 1946 and 1964, who will begin to reach retirement age in the first decade of the 21st century. These two groups have different substantive expectations as well as different time perspectives regarding such salient issues and challenges of an aging society as income maintenance, health security, caregiving, and housing. The needs of vulnerable at-risk older persons are immediate and tangible, and the challenges to society on their behalf are in many ways those described earlier in this Program Announcement under the Assistant Secretary for Aging's Home and Community Based Long Term Care Initiative.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The challenge to the baby-boom generation, and to the nation as a whole, is to prepare now to meet their not-too-distant future resource needs, to act now in an intelligent and sensible fashion so that their independence is sustained in the future. This challenge is more fully described under the Assistant Secretary for Aging's Initiative to Develop a Blueprint for an Aging Society, also described earlier in this Program Announcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The goals of the Academy are to encourage greater national leadership on aging issues through the clarification of critical issues in the field of aging, the thoughtful analysis and informed discussion of those issues in public forums, and the reporting of those policy analyses and debates to key decisionmakers. The Academy should promote discussion of nationwide approaches to these issues and challenges for the use and benefit of the Academy participants and as input to the policy deliberations of federal, state, and local governments. The major outcome of Academy events and activities should be an analytical and educational framework for better informing leaders, policy officials, and the public about the need to plan comprehensively for the growing and diverse numbers of older Americans in the 21st century.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applications should include the basics of a four-year plan for the Academy with a detailed first year agenda of symposia, seminars, public forums, research, and analysis relative to emerging national aging issues. The applicant should also plan on establishing short term working groups of experts organized around key aging issues whose tasks will be to conduct independent policy analyses resulting in policy papers for the consideration of executive and legislative officials, and others focused on aging issues. The program design for the Academy should encourage the exchange of ideas and information that will stimulate creativity and innovation in programs and methods for meeting the needs of the elderly. Attention should be devoted to bringing together participants with diverse points of view who are cognizant of the most recent policy issues and background materials pertinent to the topic focus of discussion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Participants in the program activities developed by the Academy should be drawn from aging as well as non-aging organizations, from both the private and public sectors. They should, however, share both an interest in aging issues and a capacity for shaping future aging programs and policies. Participants from the field of aging may include executives of State and Area Agencies on Aging and Tribal organizations, leaders in service provision, executives of national aging organizations, as well as researchers, educators, futurists and others in the field of aging. Participants drawn from outside the field of aging are expected to be composed of individuals with an impact on and interest in aging issues and the needs of older persons at risk. This second group includes subject matter and policy area experts, business leaders, executives from national organizations (non-aging), and leaders of public and voluntary agencies, elected and appointed public officials, labor unions, religious bodies, civic groups, and educational institutions. It is expected that through the programs offered by the Academy, these leaders will gain an enriched, more comprehensive understanding of the elderly and of the challenges of shaping national, state, community, and organizational responses to their needs. It is also expected that, through their involvement, participants will contribute their knowledge, experience and insight on aging issues vital to the formation of enlightened national policy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Applicants for the National Academy on Aging award must be qualified to provide the high level of knowledge and the expert analysis of issues expected of a prominent national forum for crystallizing our thinking and advancing our agenda regarding the future aging society. The applicant should propose a faculty whose collective expertise spans the broad range of policy and program issues in aging. It should describe how the Academy program is designed to focus attention on the salient issue of preparing the baby boom generation for their coming retirement in an aging society and on such other significant subjects as home and community based long term care, older women, and nutrition/malnutrition. In that regard, the Academy will be assisted by AoA in coordinating its agenda and scope of work, as appropriate, with the efforts of AoA-supported Resource Centers and projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One of the major tasks of the Academy will be to stimulate public officials, the business community, and individuals to prepare comprehensively for retirement in the 21st century. The successful applicant must, therefore, set forth a scope of work, and demonstrate the capacity, to analyze and synthesize a diverse set of factors and strategies for the consideration of the public, private, and voluntary sectors in planning for the aging of the baby-boom cohort and beyond.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other features of the Academy include the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The applicant selected will be awarded a Cooperative Agreement for a four-year project period. Under the Cooperative Agreement award mechanism, the Academy will not conduct its activities on behalf of AoA but rather on a cooperative basis with AoA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;AoA will advise the organization/institution selected to serve as the National Academy on Aging on the development of the Academy's agenda. However, applicants are expected to propose an agenda for the first and subsequent years based on their assessment of salient contemporary and future aging policy issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The National Academy of Aging shall have its own organizational identification and visibility within the structure of the performing organization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;The National Academy on Aging shall have a Director with an appropriate background and qualifications in aging and policy studies who will devote at least 50% of her/his time to this position. Appropriately qualified individuals shall be appointed to the Academy's faculty in full, part time, or consultant positions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;An Advisory Committee will be established to provide overall direction and guidance to the Academy in developing its agenda of major events and substantive activities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the cooperative agreement award instrument, the awardee organization will have the primary responsibility for developing and implementing the activities of the Academy. The Assistant Secretary for Aging and AoA will share with the Academy responsibility for clarifying the specific issues to be addressed by the Academy and for establishing the short term working groups of experts to be organized around key aging policy issues. AoA will, through periodic briefings and ongoing consultation, share with the Academy its knowledge of the issues being addressed by the Academy as well as information about relevant activities being undertaken by others, and provide feedback to the Academy about the usefulness to the field of its programs, forums, and other activities. The details of this relationship will be set forth in the cooperative agreement to be developed and signed prior to issuance of the award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA expects to fund the National Academy on Aging through a cooperative agreement under this priority area with a federal share of approximately $500,000 per year for a project duration of approximately four years. The deadline date for submitting applications under this priority area is July 12, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AoA funds are to be used to support the administration of the Academy, the cost of conducting core research, conference planning and meeting management, evaluation, and dissemination/utilization activities, including educational programs and living expenses of those attending. As the Academy becomes more established, the strong expectation of AoA is that the organizational sponsor of the Academy will develop additional sources of support. A plan for those sources of support and for becoming self-sufficient must be spelled out in the application, as well as an evaluation plan that reflects efforts for continuous improvement of Academy functions and activities and periodic independent examination of the impact of its work.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Heseltine set for return to work MR MICHAEL HESELTINE is to return to his office at the Department of Trade and Industry next Wednesday after being assured by his doctors that he requires no further treatment as a result of his summer heart attack. Mr Heseltine plans to concentrate at first on the department's strategic decisions, delegating less important work to others in his ministerial team. He will also scale back the number of public engagements traditionally undertaken by the secretary of state.</p>

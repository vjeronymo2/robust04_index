			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Job cuts at BNF BRITISH Nuclear Fuels yesterday announced plans to cut 270 jobs. The announcement follows the splitting of the site at Capenhurst, Cheshire, into two separate companies - with Urenco continuing uranium enrichment while BNF decommissions old plant on the site. The 570 BNF workers on the site will have less to do as the decommissioning work progresses, and the company says it aims to cut the workforce to 300 by June next year.</p>

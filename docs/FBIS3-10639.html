Neither Piotti nor  Judge Cesar Lagos released their names because the investigation  is still under way. Unofficial sources said that one of the  gang's leaders was Miguel Angel Lopez, a member of the Federal  Police's narcotics division, and that police have also arrested  a driver and a security guard employed by the company that owned  the truck, Tab-Torres. The gang also reportedly includes two  deputy police inspectors and two other non-commissioned Army  officers. Although a large array of weapons -- including an  English Stirling -- was on display during a press conference  given by Lagos Piotti denied that the gang possessed police  vehicles.</p>

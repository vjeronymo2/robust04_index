			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / International Company News: Bull back in black at operating level Groupe Bull, the French computer manufacturer in the process of being privatised, has achieved its aim of returning to profit at the operating level, according to Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, chairman. Addressing a shareholders' meeting yesterday, he said he expected an operating profit of between FFr100m and FFr300m (Dollars 18.3m-Dollars 55m) for 1994, compared with a loss of FFr1.8bn in 1993. Mr Descarpentries said the turnround reflected the restructuring and cost-cutting measures implemented over the past year, and that the company should break even at the net level by the middle of 1995. The improvement in results follows a protracted period of significant losses during which Bull has accumulated a net deficit of FFr20bn since 1989. The weak financial performance pushed the French government to seek privatisation through the formation of industry partnerships rather than through a public offer for shares. Potential bidders for stakes in Bull, which are thought to include NEC of Japan, are examining the company before making a binding final offer. The privatisation is scheduled to be completed before next spring's presidential elections. Mr Descarpentries said the improved prospects for the group should allow a flotation of shares after privatisation. He said this could involve between 10 and 20 per cent of the equity in the company and would require the agreement of its leading shareholders. According to the Bull chairman, the recovery in results reflected a series of factors, including a sharp reduction in costs. He said that non-salary costs had been cut by FFr1.25bn in 1994, and that further reductions would be made in 1995 and 1996. The group also benefited from a sharp improvement at Zenith Data Systems, its personal computer division. Mr Descarpentries said ZDS, which has a strategic alliance with Packard Bell of the US, had returned to profit at the operating level in the final quarter of the year.</p>

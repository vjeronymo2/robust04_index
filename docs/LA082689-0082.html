			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Cineplex to Repurchase Screens: Cineplex Odeon announced that it would  repurchase 153 motion picture screens in Canada for $47 million ($55.25 million  Canadian) from affiliates of Carena Developments Ltd., which had purchased the  theaters a year ago. When the earlier transaction took place, Cineplex netted  about $51.4 million (Canadian) after paying certain fees. Cineplex -- itself on  the auction block -- said it was repurchasing the theaters because of renewed  box office strength in Canada.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jozsef Szajer, chairman of the National </F> Committee of the Federation of Young Democrats, by Ferenc Hajba;  place and date not given: "The FIDESZ Remained in the Center"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Hajba] According to the  opinion polls, Hungarian voters find it difficult to understand  why the Federation of Young Democrats [FIDESZ] has moved away  from the center and why it is signaling to the government  parties even at the price of considerably reducing its own  former popularity. What is making you drift to the right: the  awakening desire for conservatism or the taste of power?    [Szajer] The FIDESZ remains in the center and it is open in  both directions; it has not denied its liberal values for a  moment, and it has no desire whatsoever for conservatism. It is  a fact, however, that the FIDESZ has refused to participate in  the increasingly radical political polarization. We try to  remain objective. Given that the Hungarian Socialist Party  [MSZP] is our main electoral rival, we are formulating our  criticism of the MSZP more firmly. This also derives from our  center position. [passage omitted]    [Hajba] There is something behind the fact that you are now  forced to explain yourself to a public that earlier sympathized  with the FIDESZ. If the FIDESZ remained in its old position but  the public thinks that it is drifting to the right, does this  mean that many people's eyes have deteriorated simultaneously?    [Szajer] No. The public probably senses a sham-movement.  Political public opinion has moved, not we. The FIDESZ is  sticking to the essence of its economic policy and ideology as  formulated in 1990. However, the public did not acknowledge  this at the time. They failed to analyze or discuss it, and the  press also manifested some sort of reserved sympathy toward our  party. It did not criticize us and did not ask questions. Most  people saw the FIDESZ as a romantic, pure, and democratic human  rights movement. However, a movement would not have been able  to survive; thus, we had to transform into a professional party.    This is one aspect involved. The other is that, at this  year's election, no party is expected to get as many seats as  the Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] got earlier. Thus, we will  probably have to think in terms of a coalition of various  parties, and this automatically means compromise. This is  natural for a party, but it is not necessarily welcome to people  who still regard the FIDESZ as a group or movement of romantic  guys opposing something.    [Hajba] In my opinion, people have nothing against  compromise; rather, they think that the future allies are not  suitable for the FIDESZ. It seems that this country has had  enough of bad political marriages.    [Szajer] Several parties have declared their willingness to  form a coalition with the FIDESZ, but we have not yet gone  anywhere to ask for any girl's hand in marriage; we only  cooperate with the other liberal party, the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ]. Therefore, there is no basis whatsoever for  any combination before the elections. [passage omitted]    [Hajba] From the viewpoint of stability, it is difficult to  envisage how the two coalition parties sticking to their ideas  will be able to cooperate with the liberal SZDSZ and the FIDESZ,  if these political organizations maintain their original image.    [Szajer] I would not enjoy such a coalition either.  However, it is impossible to exclude the possibility  completely. I think that there is no longer any question that  the current government coalition has to go. This is precisely  the goal of the FIDESZ, namely to make sure that no such  coalition can again be formed after the elections.    [Hajba] Viktor Orban announced...    [Szajer] That was not an announcement; it was only an  idea...    [Hajba] In other words, Orban's words probably caused  surprise because of earlier statements. When Peter Boross spoke  of a possible coalition with the FIDESZ in a foreign newspaper,  Viktor Orban regarded his words as a political provocation.    [Szajer] The FIDESZ did not sign a preliminary agreement  with any coalition party. Viktor Orban answered a question and  confirmed the party's position, namely that the FIDESZ is open  in every direction and can envisage cooperation with all the  democratic parties.    [Hajba] In that case, you do not consider the MSZP to be a  democratic party because, according to Viktor Orban's statement,  the FIDESZ would not form a coalition with the MSZP.    [Szajer] Among the members of the opposition roundtable, the  FIDESZ was the first to declare that the MSZP cannot be excluded  either. It is another matter whether the National Committee  would accept a coalition in which the MSZP is the leading force.    [Hajba] Would the National Committee accept this?    [Szajer] Most probably not.    [Hajba] What if the MDF were the strongest party in the  future coalition?    [Szajer] I think the National Committee would not accept  that either; we would prefer to stay in opposition. Naturally,  it is another situation if we have the chance for a coalition  under a strong liberal dominance. Therefore, a lot depends on  who asks whom for a coalition and what bargaining position we  achieve at the elections. Until then, it is totally useless to  say categorical and exclusive things.</p>

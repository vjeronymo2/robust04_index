			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Tokyo stock market plunges JAPANESE shares plunged yesterday as investors lost faith in the government's willingness to act quickly to stimulate the country's flagging economy. The Nikkei average of leading stocks fell 598.65 to 15,921.22, the first time it has finished below 16,000 since October 1986. The fall added to nervousness in London over the sluggishness of the main world economies, and the FT-SE index closed almost 35 points down at 2,550.3. In New York, however, leading US stocks rebounded to close with modest losses after declining more than 30 points at one stage on the back of the depressed markets in Japan and Britain. The Dow Jones industrial average ended off 4.55 at 3,280.80. In Tokyo today, stocks weakened further in hesitant early trading and the Nikkei had fallen by nearly 50 points. Yesterday, when the bear market plumbed new depths, brokers were unable to forecast how much further stocks might fall. Mr Jason James, an analyst at James Capel, the UK-based securities company, said: 'There are chances that the 15,000 level for the Nikkei will hold. But, on the other hand, there really isn't a reason why it should.' Mr Tatsuhiko Kusuzawa, a senior managing director at Yamaichi Securities, said: 'The private sector cannot do anything. Everything now depends on what kind of fiscal and monetary boost the authorities can implement.' The government gave no clear indication of its plans, undermining the impression given last Friday that ruling Liberal Democratic party officials were forcing the cautious Ministry of Finance into advancing plans for increased government spending. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, said at a press conference marking the end of a session of the Diet that the economy was now the Japanese people's main concern. However, he made no specific commitments to take action to stimulate the economy. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, ruled out action to resuscitate the stock market through immediate measures, such as increases in public works spending. But behind the scenes LDP officials are lobbying with increasing intensity for an extra spending package of up to Y5,000bn (Pounds 21bn) to Y8,000bn. The stock market's fall below 16,000 has cut into the value of securities holdings of big financial institutions, including banks and life assurance companies. Mr Nobuhiro Kaneda, a general manager at Daiwa Securities, the stockbroker, estimated that the Nikkei's drop would lead to some banks having difficulty in meeting international standards of capital adequacy set by the Bank for International Settlements.

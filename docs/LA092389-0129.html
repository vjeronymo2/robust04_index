			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EL TORO STARTS FAST, WINS, 42-13  </P> <P> Although Torrey Pines High School made a 13-point comeback in the third quarter  against El Toro, they couldn't overcome the Chargers' 35 first-half points and  lost to El Toro, 42-13.  </P> <P> El Toro wasted no time, scoring 12 seconds into the game when Danny Maestas  took the third opening kick (the first two traveled out of bounds) 80 yards  into the end zone.  </P> <P> Just 2:33 later, the Chargers took a 14-0 lead on Jerome Oakman's 52-yard  touchdown scamper, which came on the Chargers' first offensive play of the  game.  </P> <P> With the score 28-0 and halftime seconds away, the Falcons tried to save some  dignity with a fake punt. Upman Phil Stewart took the snap 16 yards for a first  down, and it appeared the Falcons were rolling.  </P> <P> But defensive back Mike Miller intercepted a Gregg Wilbur pass on the next play  and returned it 15 yards to the Falcon 46.  </P> <P> From there, quarterback Steve Stenstrom guided the Chargers on a three-play  scoring drive, capping it with a 25-yard touchdown throw to Kevin Rowe for a  35-0 lead. That gave El Toro's second- and third-stringers a chance to play.  </P> <P> Stenstrom, who played only the first half, completed eight of 13 passes for 108  yards and two touchdowns. Oakman rushed for 141 yards and two touchdowns in 13  carries. JOHN GEIS  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROBITAILLE TOPS NHL ALL-STAR BALLOTING  </P> <P> The Kings' Luc Robitaille outpolled teammate Wayne Gretzky for the second  consecutive season to lead all vote-getters Wednesday in balloting for the  Campbell Conference All-Star team.  </P> <P> Robitaille, a left wing who leads the Kings with 31 goals, received 298,914  votes in fan balloting for the Jan. 21 NHL All-Star game at the Pittsburgh  Civic Arena.  </P> <P> He had more than three times the votes received by the left wing runner-up,  Gerard Gallant of Detroit.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty happy," Robitaille said. "It's always a surprise. I guess I picked  the right position as a kid, left wing. It's always fun to be there."  </P> <P> Gretzky had 276,980 votes, more than twice as many as Detroit center Steve  Yzerman.  </P> <P> Also voted as starters were Calgary's goaltender Mike Vernon and defenseman Al  MacInnis, St. Louis right wing Brett Hull and Edmonton defenseman Kevin Lowe.  MacInnis led defensemen with 218,000 votes. Lowe had 187,091. The Kings' Steve  Duchesne was fewer than 5,300 votes behind Lowe.  </P></p>

			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Airlines to replace engine fuse pins BRITISH Airways and Virgin Atlantic, the two UK operators of Boeing 747 aircraft, have decided to replace the fuse pins securing the engines of their 747 fleets after each jumbo has made 3,000 landings, Paul Betts writes. The move follows a recommendation from Boeing yesterday to all 747 operators to conduct additional inspections of fuse pins and engine struts. The failure of fuse pins caused by metal fatigue and corrosion is regarded by accident investigators as probably the main cause of the Amsterdam disaster last month, when an El Al 747 cargo aircraft crashed into a a block of flats after losing two engines shortly after take-off. After an initial inspection Boeing said it found very few cases of cracked fuse pins.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 2 (TANJUG) -- Bosnian Muslim army  commander, Gen. Rasim Delic on Monday confirmed that the Muslim  side was preparing an offensive on the Serbs in the area of  Brcko, a town in the northern part of the former Yugoslav  republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Gen. Delic, who toured together  with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic Muslim units on the  front south of Brcko, said that `the Brcko front was the key to  the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina,' according to Muslim-held Radio  Sarajevo.    Gen. Delic confirmed that preparations were under way for a  Muslim offensive at Brcko on the corridor which links the  western and eastern parts of the Bosnian Serb republic (R.S.),  and set out, `we have nothing to wait for, and we will launch a  decisive reckoning with Serb forces for the [word indistinct] of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in that section of the front.' Gen. Delic  said in a meeting with the local Muslim commanders that `the  Bosnia-Herzegovina (Muslim) presidency and government will do  everything for preparations for the offensive to be completed  successfully.'    R.S. military sources have more than once in the past  several  days said that the Muslim side is preparing a large-scale  offensive operation in the Brkco region with a view to cutting  off the corridor. The same sources said that, as part of the  preparations, Muslim military authorities first carried out  massive mobilization in Sarajevo and then pulled out over 10,000  troops from the city and sent them across Mount Igman to central  and northern Bosnia. However, foreign media have been accusing  the Serbs of massing troops around Brcko, and the U.S.  Government is considering initiating an emergency action in the  U.N. Security Council for the adoption of a resolution on  intervention of NATO forces in case of armed conflicts between  Serbs and Muslims in the Brcko region, which would be a further  instance of the U.N. siding with the Muslims.    Commander of the U.S. military base in Frankfurt, Gen.  Rolanger arrived in Sarajevo on Monday and met with Muslim  Presidency member Ejup Ganic, Radio Sarajevo said and set out  that no details of the talks had been disclosed.</p>

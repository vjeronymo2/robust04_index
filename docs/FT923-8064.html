			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Liberalisation of insurance nearer THE UK took a step towards liberalising its insurance market in accordance with European rules by publishing draft regulations for introducing the second life insurance directive. The directive provides for limited cross-border sales of life insurance. It is expected to be superseded by a third directive, allowing for more extensive liberalisation. The government expects formal adoption of the third directive later this year.</p>

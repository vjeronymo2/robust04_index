			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / International Company News: Anglo-Alpha beats forecast ANGLO-ALPHA, one of South Africa's three leading cement producers, did better than forecast to record a 3.6 per cent fall in earnings in the year to December. Turnover was 4.4 per cent up at R728.2m (Dollars 258.6m), reflecting a fall in sales volumes of 10 per cent on average across the group. Net operating income was 19.1 per cent lower at R135.6m. The operating margin dropped to an all-time low for the group of 18.6 per cent from 24.1 per cent in 1990. The performance was better than the 5 per cent decline in earnings forecast at the halfway mark. The fall in operating income resulted from maintenance costs at the cement division's Dudfield operation and a substantial one-off rise in depreciation costs at the stone division. Net income attributable to shareholders dropped to R58m from R60.2m. The overall dividend was lifted by 15.2 per cent to 152 cents per share, in line with group policy of declaring dividends at least in line with inflation.</p>

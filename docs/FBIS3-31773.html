			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 0900 GMT on 24 February carries  within its regular seven-minute newscast several reports on the  situation in the republic.    A report by the Information Service of the 1st Corps of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army read by correspondent Sead Curtovic  speaks about "the activity of the Serbian aggressor in the  protected zone of Sarajevo despite the NATO ultimatum" and says  that "since last evening, the chetniks have violated the truce  on several occasions, mostly provocations with infantry weapons.  Late last night, a fragmentation mortar bomb was launched from  chetnik positions at Bacici onto the Brijesce district. This  morning, a [word indistinct] mortar has been in operation at  Blekin Potok."    Hajrudin Sermic reports from Maglaj about the "great tragedy  that occurred in Maglaj at about 1900 [1800 GMT]" when "a direct  hit from a howitzer shell on a humanitarian institution, a  health center, killed five people; 16 people were seriously  wounded, most of them crippled. The casualties were the medical  staff, ambulance drivers, nurses, and patients who were waiting  for help to be administered." Finally, Sermic reports that "as  of 0700 this morning, battles resumed unabated announcing  another, even more difficult and bloody day. All defense lines  have been attacked with the same ferocity, but the situation is  worst in the region of Plane, Krsno Polje, and Lijesnica."    Mirza Sadikovic reports about "the Serb aggressor planning a  long and exhausting offensive on the Bihac region, confirmed by  last night and today's 19th day of incessant attacks on this  part of the republic. Howitzer, tanks, all kinds of mortars,  Zis and Bofors weapons, and antiaircraft weapons have the entire  night pounded the defenders positions at the Grabez section of  the front, as well as the Hasin Vrh and Grmusko-Srbljanski  heights. Moreover, the chetniks continued the systematic  destruction of the suburbs of the Bihac and Cazin communes, as  well as the free section of the (?Bosanska Krupa) territory.  Along the dividing lines with the remnants of the paramilitary  formations of the so-called Kladusa autonomous region,  provocations and activities of extremist groups were registered  in all sectors last night."</p>

The Venezuelan minister said he believes Clinton's  initiative  is of "supreme interest" as a way to develop new relations  between the United States and Latin America following the end of  the Cold War.    Burelli said: "We hope the schedule" for the Miami summit  "will be established soon." Burelli will participate in a  48-hour meeting of foreign ministers and governmental  representatives from 13 Rio Group countries that begins today at  Itamaraty, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry headquarters.    This summit will allow an exchange of opinions toward  consensus among Latin American governments before the summit  called by President Clinton, and to review the international  situation.    The ministers will establish the bases for two upcoming Rio  Group summits: the talks that are held twice a year with the EC  foreign ministers -- scheduled for 20-23 April in Sao Paulo --  and the Eighth Annual Rio Group summit scheduled for 8-9  September in Rio de Janeiro.    Even though it is not on the agenda, the delegates will use  the meeting to probe preferences for the election of a new OAS  secretary general on 27 March in Washington.    Diplomatic sources have stated that this issue will crop up  in lobby talks and even in the Rio Group's three flexible  sessions as any delegation head is allowed to raise it.    Foreign Minister Burelli is one of the candidates for the  OAS  General Secretariat, replacing Brazilian diplomat Joao Baena  Soares, whose five-year term ends in June.    Colombian President Cesar Gaviria and Costa Rican Foreign  Minister Bernd Niehaus are also running.    Foreign Minister Burelli indicated that the Rio Group must  forge "a social bias" for Latin American policy because "the  people eagerly want consideration in the decision-making  process."    Burelli said: "Poverty represents a new scourge within  society as it has new elements of insecurity that cannot be  fought with armies. It is tied to hunger, terrorism, drug  trafficking, violence, and growing destitution."    Burelli said that internal and external migration in Latin  American countries has helped to form "pockets" of misery in  large cities. He mentioned the migration from rural areas and  the arrival of about 60,000 Guyanese citizens in Venezuela.  They become involved in the underground economy.    The people responsible for regional diplomacy will assess a  preliminary document entitled: "Poverty, Destitution, and  Unemployment." This document was compiled at the Rio Group's  request by experts from various governments, the Economic  Commission for Latin America (ECLA), and the United Nations.    The document proposes guidelines to cure the phenomena and  will become a Rio Group's contribution for the UN Conference on  Social Development scheduled for 1995 in the city of Copenhagen.</p>

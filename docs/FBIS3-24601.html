Breusenko; All-Union Scientific Research Institute (VNII) of  General and Criminal Psychiatry, Moscow, 119839; UDC  543.544.42:57.083.3]    [Abstract] The recent discovery of two new neurospecific  proteins (NSP) -- _a_-1 BG and _a_-2 BG -- in human brain  extract has opened new horizons in the search for these proteins  and antibodies against them in the biological fluids of patients  with various neuro-psychiatric diseases. In this work, a highly  sensitive variant of immunoenzyme analysis based on column  immunoadsorption chromatography (TIEAIC -- two-site immunoenzyme  analysis by immunoadsorption chromatography) was developed for  quantitative determination of antibodies against _a_-1 BG and  _a_-2 BG (detection limit -- 0.35 ng/ml). The phenomenon of the  presence of antibodies against the above-listed proteins was  identified in extreme conditions caused by psychiatric diseases  (36-42%), multiple sclerosis in the active phase  (16-29%),  injuries (14-43%), astrocytomal (14-33%) and  oligodendrogliomal (18-40%) brain tumors, as well as  influenza  (13%), intestinal infections (6-9%), pneumonia  (28%), and  peritonitis and pancreatitis (25-33%). The authors  proposed  that TIEAIC analysis of antibodies against _a_-1 BG and  _a_-2 BG  may be used as an auxiliary test for diagnostics and monitoring  during the treatment of several diseases whose pathogeneses  involve a breach in the blood-brain barrier.

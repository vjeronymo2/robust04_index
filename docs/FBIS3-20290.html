The topic of the  talks was the intensification of bilateral relations between  Albania and Great Britain and cooperation in the economic field.  They also discussed the aid that Great Britain may provide to  Albania in various fields and its support and integration in the  European structures.    Regarding the regional question, President Berisha said that  "the Albanian question is still a sharp regional problem, whose  resolution is directly linked with the stability in the Balkans.  This issue calls for general solutions and it should be on the  agenda along other international problems." Mr. Berisha  reiterated that the lifting of the embargo against Serbia must  be conditioned with the resolution of the Kosova question, the  establishing of Kosova under the UN forces' control and the  completion of an agreement on the status of Kosova.    Appreciating the so far achievements in Albania, Douglas  Hogg  expressed the conviction that there are possibilities for  cooperation in fields of common interest such as in trade,  tourism, and other fields. As regards the Kosova question, Mr.  Hogg said that this issue needs an urgent solution. "We are for  a policy which aims at granting autonomy to Kosova," Mr. Hogg  said.    In the meeting with Baroness Chalker, minister of  development  with overseas countries, the talk focused on the realisation of  the projects which are under way and the possibilities for the  expansion of these projects and commissioning of new ones in the  future. After appreciating the aid of the British Government and  non-government humanitarian organizations, Mr. Berisha pointed  out the support that Britain may render to Albania in the  reorganization of the banking system, in infrastructure, glass  industry and culture.    Mr. Berisha met with a group of representatives of the  "Premje" Oil company, which is now having negotiations with  Albpetrol. The group appreciated the cooperation and expressed  their commitment to start their activity in Albania as soon as  possible. In the meeting that President Berisha had with a BBC  group, they discussed possibilities for cooperation in various  fields of common interest.    In the afternoon of March 28, President Berisha met with the  British premier, John Major. Mr. Major said he will encourage  British investments in Albania and expressed his readiness to  support Albania's integration into European institutions, in the  European Union, the Western European Union, adding that he will  make his contribution to include Albania in the associate  agreement. Mr. Major also offered his support for the  membership of the Albanian Democratic Party in the European  Democratic Union.    The meeting also focused on the situation in the region.  President Berisha presented the Albanian question. "This  issue," he said, "in which the Kosova question is of priority,  is rather delicate and complex in the Balkan peninsula. Putting  it into the agenda of the international questions has become an  indispensability. In this context, non-removal of the embargo  against Serbia, dispatch of observers in Kosova and the efforts  to guarantee Kosova an acceptable status for all parties serve  the stability in the region. Albania and the Albanian political  forces wherever they are," Mr. Berisha said, "will try to  prevent the conflict, whose spillover will bring about a Balkan  war. Reestablishing of Albanian institutions, the free movement  of the Albanians, the implementation of the UN resolutions in  relation with Kosova are the first steps for a dialogue. But  the Albanians ask that this dialogue be conducted in the  presence of a third party, because so far Belgrade has left no  room to act in this direction," Albanian president said.    British Premier Major said: "We are worried about the  situation in the Balkans and appreciate the role of Albania as a  factor for stability. We are already committed that the embargo  should continue and we shall work for the dispatch of monitors  in Kosova." Mr. Major agreed on the questions discussed in the  meeting and accepted with pleasure the invitation extended to  him to visit Albania.</p>

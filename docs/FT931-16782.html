			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Land Rover lifts production 5% LAND ROVER, the four-wheel-drive vehicles subsidiary of Rover Group, increased its production by nearly 5 per cent last year to 57,316 - the highest level since 1979 - in spite of one of the worstdeclines on record in the UK car market. The increased output reflected the Birmingham-based group's continuing high export content. More than 70 per cent of vehicles were exported to about 100 markets worldwide. The increase was due entirely to the Discovery model launched by Land Rover in 1990. Its output jumped by 26.4 per cent last year to 24,347. Production of the more luxurious Range Rover and the utility Land Rover models each fell by about 6 per cent. The company, which refused yesterday to forecast likely sales or production for the current year, had to step up production twice in the second half of last year and resort to Saturday working to meet demand for the Discovery.</p>

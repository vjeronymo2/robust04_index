			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: American Home Products 9% ahead AMERICAN Home Products, the US pharmaceutical company, recorded year-on-year net income growth of 9 per cent in the second quarter, ahead of some analysts' expectation. However, this was not enough to prevent its shares falling by Dollars 1 to Dollars 63 5/8 in the face of a general sell-off of drug stocks yesterday morning as brokers Smith Barney downgraded the sector. Net income for the quarter rose to Dollars 287.5m, from Dollars 263.5m, as income per share jumped by 11 per cent to 93 cents from 84 cents, aided by the purchase of 4.4m shares by the company in the first half of the year. Sales advanced to Dollars 1.9bn from Dollars 1.76bn. The biggest sales growth came from consumer health care products, which were ahead by 13 per cent at Dollars 354m. The company attributed the growth to increased sales of oral health care products in Latin America. First-half sales growth as a whole in consumer health care products was limited to 7 per cent, due to weak sales in the US analgesic market and 'a less severe cold and flu season'. Pharmaceuticals, which accounted for the bulk of the group's Dollars 1.9bn sales, saw sales volume grow by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn in the second quarter, led by higher sales of infant nutritional and cardiovascular products in the US. Sales of medical supplies and diagnostic products advanced by 9 per cent, to Dollars 217m.</p>

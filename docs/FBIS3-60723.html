			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by UNIAN correspondent Volodymyr Ivakhnenko: </F> ``A `Missile War' Without Shooting'']    [Text] It is expected that, starting from January 1994,  gas chambers in nuclear reactors of liquid-propellant strategic  missiles known as SS-19 will gradually become unserviceable.  After the Ukrainian Parliament ratified, with reservations,  START-1, Russian specialists, in fact, refused to provide  technical maintenance of SS-19 warheads, including the supply of  hydrogen absorbers.    The Ukrainian leadership has been driven into a corner. The  West and Russia continue putting pressure upon Ukraine,  demanding that it become a nuclear-free state as soon as  possible and unconditionally. Time works against Ukraine. As is  known, after a certain period of storage, missile warheads  become dangerously explosive and are not subject to dismantling.  This is perfectly well understood in Russia. However, in the  Kremlin, an openly temporizing position has been taken, until  the condition of the SS-19's approaches critical. Then, Moscow  will be able to count upon Ukrainian missiles without any  compensation. Accordingly, Russia will be able to dictate its  own terms: Either it accepts all missiles (together with solid-  propellant SS-24) or none.    Kiev is definitely lacking the initiative. It could, for  example, make a good-will gesture by offering Moscow some of the  SS- 19 warheads in exchange for fuel for nuclear reactors.    In this situation, there remains, perhaps, a last step that  Kiev could take. Without waiting for assistance from Moscow, it  may hand over to Washington (or to some other interested party,  for example, China) the right to the dismantled  liquid-propellant missiles, after receiving guarantees and  monetary compensation. This will not be at variance with the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, if we deal with members of the  ``nuclear club.'' (The treaty bans such actions only with  regard to nonnuclear states). In such a case, Moscow would see  that the problem may also be resolved without it. In turn, the  Pentagon would get a unique chance to study Soviet missile  technology. This step is inadmissible from the point of view of  Russian security. However, to all appearances, only in this way  the Kremlin politicians may become more compliant with regard to  compensation and assistance.    Even though, theoretically, this is a perfectly possible  development of events, there arise many practical questions in  the ``American'' variant.</p>

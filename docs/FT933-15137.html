			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / TV advertising deals probed SIR GEORGE RUSSELL, chairman of the Independent Television Commission, is looking into complaints about the way advertising time is sold around News at Ten. A number of advertisers are believed to have expressed concern about the nature of the package deals being done. One significant advertiser which is interested in reaching up-market AB men and is particularly interested in the centre break during News at Ten, found its advertisements also being run during children's programmes. It is not clear whether this occurred because of anti-competitive pressures or because of misjudgments by advertising agencies. If advertisers were being required to buy slots around other programmes in order to get their advertisements accepted for the News at Ten centre break it would almost certainly be deemed anti-competitive, discriminatory behaviour. Sir George has been asking questions of the ITV companies to try to ensure that nothing of the sort is happening. The issue is sensitive because of the row over attempts to move News at Ten to an earlier slot. The fact that most television advertising is bought in packages rather than individual slots makes it difficult to value a single advertising break or get a clear view of the negotiating tactics of buyers and sellers. Satellite dish ownership in Britain rose by 48,000 in the month to April 24, according to the latest market research by GfK. The market research group believes that by the later part of April 2.2m homes had satellite dishes. GfK believes that there will be a slowing down of satellite dish sales this autumn as a result of British Sky Broadcasting  -a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake - moving all its channels into a subscription package, with the possible exception of Sky News. GfK said: 'We would expect some slowing down in the net rate of sale.' The company, whose research does not cover Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands, is projecting a total of 2.5m dishes by the end of the year. Barb, the organisation which provides official television rating figures, estimates that at the beginning of this month there were 2.48m satellite-dish homes, compared with 2.44m a month earlier.</p>

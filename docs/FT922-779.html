			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of India (9): Foreign banks ready to seize opportunities - 'Economic reform has gained such a momentum you cannot turn it back' THE LURE of wide lending margins and a fast liberalising economy make the eyes of foreign bankers glint. To hear them talk, India is likely to offer some of the best banking opportunities around in the coming decade, and foreign banks have a good chance of profiting. Compared with their domestic rivals, foreign banks have a number of advantages. They are not weighed down by the requirement to place a fixed proportion of their deposits in government debt - though they do have to set aside a certain amount (currently 15 per cent of deposits) for lending to priority sectors. Their relative freedom means that they can devote more of their resources to commercial lending, where margins are around 6 per cent. Nor do foreign banks face some of the other burdens of domestic banks: the lack of computerisation or militant unions, for instance. The need to get specific approval from the authorities every time they want to open a branch is not seen by most as a severe restriction on business. Confidence in economic reform lies behind the current enthusiasm of most foreign bankers. 'It has already gained such a momentum, you cannot turn it back,' says Mr Hinrich Frese, chief executive of Deutsche Bank in India. 'There is only one way, which is forward, towards further liberalisation.' Like many foreign financiers in the country, he talks enthusiastically about the long-term prospects. 'Manufacturers make a mistake to disregard India.' Several German companies have begun operations in India, including Hoescht, Bayer and Siemens. So far, Deutsche is the only German bank to have set up operations to follow them. The failure of Indian banks to provide modern banking services for their customers (most have only a handful of computerised branches in metropolitan centres) has opened up another opportunity for foreign banks. Most bankers say there is a strong demand for better services. 'What the customer gets in Pakistan or the Gulf, he expects here,' says Mr Frese. The potential market is vast. There are fewer than 1m credit cards in issue in India. Consumer finance hardly exists. 'The only question is, who gets into the business first,' says Mr Vikram Talwar, senior vice president in charge of Bank of America's Indian operations. BoA, along with Citibank and others, says it is making substantial efforts to gain a foothold in the market. 'This is the only country outside the US where we are making a major investment in retail business,' says Mr Talwar. The bank plans to launch itself on the market with the full paraphernalia of modern retail banking - automated teller machines, home banking, credit cards and consumer loans. 'Technology is going to be the key,' says Mr Talwar. The general mood of optimism, however, has been badly dented by the securities scandal that has shaken India in recent weeks. The fraud erupted in the market in which banks trade securities between themselves - a market which has been developed by the aggressive trading of a handful of foreign banks in the past decade. At least two of them - Standard Chartered and ANZ Grindlays - have been badly stung. Both have had to move funds into the country to bolster the liquidity of their operations as a result. Standard Chartered has launched criminal actions to try to recover Rs9.04bn (Pounds 162m) from brokers and others who it claims defrauded it through the market. According to the Reserve Bank of India, Standard paid out Rs3bn without receiving any securities. It is also holding securities with a face value of Rs7.5bn issued by two small banks, neither of which has sufficient assets to pay it. ANZ Grindlays managed to avoid direct loss in the interbank securities market, but has been tripped up by the fraud in a different way. It received cheques totalling Rs4bn from the National Housing Bank and paid the money into the account of Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal. NHB says it never received any securities for the payments, and that ANZ had no right to put the money into Mr Mehta's account (the cheques had been made out in ANZ's name). Mr Mehta and members of his family have since been charged with fraud, while ANZ has been ordered to repay the Rs4bn to the NHB. The fall-out from the securities scandal has made a serious dent in the reputations of both ANZ and Standard Chartered in India. It has also made more clear to all foreign banks the risks of operating in the country. 'This is a malfunctioning of the industry - not just of certain participants in the market,' says Mr Frese of Deutsche Bank. The German bank's own financial services subsidiary has also been hit by losses in the interbank market, he says. Until the market is put on a safer footing, it will remain a precarious place to do business.</p>

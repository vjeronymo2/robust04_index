			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Donors promise Dollars 7.4bn aid for India INDIA'S donor countries, led by the World Bank, yesterday pledged assistance worth Dollars 7.4bn (Pounds 4.93bn) for 1993-94, far exceeding the expectations of the Indian government and the World Bank. The pledge, which came at the conclusion of the two-day Aid India consortium, the annual meeting held in Paris between India and its international aid donors, was Dollars 200m more than last year's figure of Dollars 7.2bn. The pledges from multilateral sources accounted for Dollars 4.2bn, with the World Bank accounting for more than Dollars 3bn and the Asian Development Bank, Dollars 1.2bn. Indian officials are relieved the fast-disbursing assistance component is Dollars 2.2bn, which will help tide India over transitional difficulties in its third year of economic reforms. Officials said there was marked support from the UK, Germany and the US. While acknowledging that the Indian economy had made considerable progress last year despite the politically turbulent times, most of the donors agreed with the view expressed by Mr Joseph Wood, the World Bank's vice-president for South Asia, that 'the pace of future economic reform in India will depend also on the government's ability to establish a viable external financing plan that covers the difficult period that lies ahead.' In Delhi yesterday the government announced its intention to further deepen the reform process and reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of the GDP by 1996-97 from this year's 7 per cent.</p>

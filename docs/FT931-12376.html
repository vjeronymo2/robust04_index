			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Stakis calls for Pounds 28m and sells its nursing homes STAKIS emerged from conval-escence yesterday by selling its nursing homes side for Pounds 50m cash and launching a Pounds 28m 1-for-3 rights issue. It will now concentrate on hotels and casinos, where, it says, performance is improving. Stakis made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 305,000 in the year ended September 1992, compared with a loss of Pounds 47.4m of which Pounds 43.68m were exceptionals. The sale of the nursing homes and the rights issue will cut Stakis's debt from Pounds 197m to below Pounds 120m and enable the company to pay off 12 of its lending banks and agree a two-year facility with the remaining nine, replacing a standstill arrangement. Sir Lewis Robertson, who came in as chairman in early 1991 when the problems of the over-extended company became critical, said the company had made a 'substantial move towards normal banking relationships.' Stakis's future was now, 'much more firmly assured with its senior direction fully settled.' Ashbourne Homes, which operates 18 upmarket nursing homes, has been sold to a syndicate led by the Electra Private Equity Partners fund, which raised Pounds 486m in 1990 to invest in private equity. The fund includes the quoted Electra Investment Trust. In addition to the Pounds 50m purchase price the investors will provide a further Pounds 8m available to fund development. Along with Electra in supplying the Pounds 28m equity components of the deal are Prudential Venture Managers, Causeway Capital and Schroder Ventures. Senior debt comes from the Bank of Scotland, Midland Bank and 3i. Mr David Symondson of Electra Kingsway, which arranged the deal, said it had originally discussed a joint venture with Stakis. Ashbourne might eventually be floated on the Stock Exchange. Stakis decided to sell Ashbourne Homes, which made an operating profit of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 2m), because of the future burden of developing its 21 sites for new homes, as well as the high cost of maintaining the sites. Mr David Michels, Stakis's chief executive, said that developing the sites would have cost Stakis about Pounds 70m when it wanted to do other things. Stakis is taking an extraordinary loss on the sale of Pounds 47.7m. There was a recent improvement in casinos which earlier in the year suffered from the effect on spending of recession. Operating profit was virtually unchanged at Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 6.5m). Operating margins on the 30 hotels had improved and the division made operating profits of Pounds 13.84m (Pounds 7.15m). Turnover from the continuing hotel and casino businesses was Pounds 124.1m last year (Pounds 128.6m). Including discontinued businesses, group turnover was Pounds 154.1m (Pounds 171.4m). Sir Lewis has no intention of retiring as chairman and his contract runs until next year. He could eventually be succeeded by Mr Richard Cole-Hamilton, former chief executive of Clydesdale Bank, who joined the board last month. The rights issue involves one new share for every three existing held on January 18 at 32p per share. Stakis passed its interim dividend but is paying a final dividend of 0.45p (0.9p). Earnings were 0.15p (losses 16.74p). Stakis shares rose 4p to 45p. See Lex</p>

			<p><P> December 1, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> FORECASTING GAUGE FOR ECONOMY DROPS;  </P> <P> LEADING INDICATORS: DECLINE OF 0.4% IN OCTOBER IS NO SURPRISE. ANALYSTS WARY,  BUT DON'T EXPECT RECESSION.  </P> <P> The government's chief economic forecasting gauge fell 0.4% in October, the  sixth month of declines or no gain this year, the government said today.  </P> <P> The drop in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, which is designed to  forecast economic activity six to nine months in advance, followed gains of  0.3% in September and 0.6% in August. Both gains were revised in today's report  to reflect a slightly better increase than earlier reported.  </P> <P> The October drop was in line with most economists' expectation.  </P> <P> For the first 10 months of 1989, the index has fallen five times, risen four  times and remained unchanged in one month.  </P> <P> The various changes left the index at 144.6% of its 1982 base of 100. That  represents a 0.4% decline at an annual rate for the year so far, compared with  a 3.8% gain in the first 10 months of 1988.  </P> <P> The economy, as measured by the gross national product, expanded at a moderate  2.7% rate in the July-September quarter. But analysts say the economy has  slowed sharply in the current quarter.  </P> <P> A few economists believe the country is on the verge of toppling into a  recession after an unprecedented peacetime expansion of seven years, but most  express confidence that the Federal Reserve won't let that happen.  </P> <P> "We'll skirt the edge of a recession, but not fall in," said Bruce Steinberg,  an economist at Merrill Lynch brokerage. "The reason is . . . interest rates  are coming down substantially."  </P> <P> Indeed, an expansion of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board was one  of four forward-looking business statistics that partly offset six negative  indicators in the index.  </P> <P> Stock prices, despite the Friday-the-13th plunge in October, were a neutral  factor.  </P> <P> The two biggest negatives were an increase in claims for unemployment insurance  and a drop in the average work week for factory workers.  </P> <P> The other weak signs were a drop in unfilled orders at factories; a decline in  a consumer confidence survey; faster deliveries of factory goods, indicating  slackening demand, and fewer new orders for consumer goods.  </P> <P> An increase in building permits, a rise in prices for sensitive materials and  an increase in capital investment spending by businesses were the positive  factors in addition to the money supply.  </P> <P> The recent economic weakness is considered the result of a yearlong  anti-inflation program by the Federal Reserve, which cooled the economy and  inflationary pressures by boosting short-term interest rates through this  spring. But in June, the central bank began nudging rates down again, hoping to  stave off a recession.  </P> <P> "A lot of the slowdown we're looking at now came as a result of Fed tightening  between March, 1988, and March, 1989. Now the Fed has reversed those moves and  we will start to see some recovery," said economist David Jones of Aubrey G.  Lanston &amp; Co., a government securities dealer in New York.  </P></p>

The institution may appeal on the grounds that_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation is not accurate; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The institution meets the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Fifteen percent or fewer of the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students who are enrolled on at least a half-time basis receive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Stafford or Federal SLS loans for any twenty-four month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ending not more than six months prior to the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits its appeal; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) For any twenty-four month period ending not more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two-thirds or more of the institution's students who are enrolled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on at least a half-time basis are individuals from disadvantaged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> economic backgrounds, as established by documentary evidence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submitted by the institution. Such evidence must relate to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualification by those students for an Expected Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contribution (EFC) (formerly institutions were required to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Pell Grant index), as defined in 34 CFR 690.2, of zero for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicable award year or attribution to those students of an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjusted gross income of the student and his or her parents or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spouse, if applicable, reported for the applicable award year of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less than the poverty level, as determined under criteria  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> established by the Department of Health and Human Services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) Two-thirds or more of the institution's students who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were enrolled on a full-time basis in any twenty-four month  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period ending not more than six months prior to the date the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits its appeal completed the educational programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in which they were enrolled. This rate is calculated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparing the number of students who were classified as full-time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at their initial enrollment in the institution, and were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> originally scheduled, at the time of enrollment, to complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their programs within the relevant twenty-four month period, with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the number of these students who received a degree, certificate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or other recognized educational credential from the institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transferred from the institution to a higher level educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program at another institution for which the prior program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided substantial preparation; or, at the end of the twenty-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four month period, remained enrolled and were making satisfactory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic progress toward completion of their educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The calculation does not include students who did not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete their programs because they left the institution to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serve in the armed forces; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The institution had a placement rate of two-thirds or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more with respect to its former students who received a degree,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certificate, or other recognized educational credential from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution in any twenty-four month period ending not more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> six months prior to the date the institution submits its appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rate is calculated by determining the percentage of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those students who, based on evidence submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, are on that date employed, or had been employed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at least 13 weeks following receipt of the credential from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution, in the occupation for which the institution provided  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> training, or are enrolled or had been enrolled for at least 13  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weeks following receipt of the credential from the institution,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a higher level educational program at another institution for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the prior educational program provided substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section, a student is originally scheduled, at the time of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment, to complete the educational program on the date when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the student will have been enrolled in the program for the amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time normally required to complete the program. The ``amount  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time normally required to complete the program'' is the period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of time specified in the institution's enrollment contract,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> catalog, or other materials, for completion of the program by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> full-time student, or the period of time between the date of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enrollment and the anticipated graduation date appearing on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student's loan application, if any, whichever is less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An appeal submitted under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section is considered to be filed in a timely manner if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits a letter of appeal by the 30-day deadline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notifying the Secretary's designated department official that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is appealing on this basis, including with that letter a copy of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the institution's request to each cognizant guaranty agency for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verification of the cohort default rate data, and submits the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> verified data to the Secretary's designated department official  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within five working days of its receipt from the guaranty agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For purposes of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's appeal is not considered complete until the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution submits the verified data to the Secretary's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated department official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The Secretary issues a decision on the institution's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal within 45 days after the institution submits a complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal that addresses the applicable criteria in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary's designated department official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) The Secretary's decision is based on the consideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of written material submitted by the institution. No oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) The Secretary withdraws the notification of loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participation in the FFEL programs sent to an institution under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (c)(1) of this section, if the Secretary determines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the institution's appeal satisfies one of the grounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specified in paragraphs (d)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)(i) An institution that appeals under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section must submit a written request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the guaranty agency or agencies that guaranteed the loans used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the calculation of its cohort default rate to verify the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used to calculate its cohort default rate and simultaneously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide a copy of that request to the Secretary's designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> department official.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The written request must include the names and social  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security numbers of the borrowers the institution wishes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agency to verify and detailed information on the nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspected inaccuracy in the data the institution is requesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the agency to verify.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) An institution must include in its appeal a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification by the institution's chief executive officer that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all information provided by the institution in support of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal is true and correct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) An institution that appeals on the ground that it meets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the criteria contained in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must include in its appeal the following information:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) For purposes of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A)( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) The number of students who were enrolled on at least a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> half-time basis at the institution in the relevant twenty-four month period; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

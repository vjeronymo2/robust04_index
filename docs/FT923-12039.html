			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: More bears than traps Yesterday's action by central banks to support the dollar was good news for those who had begun to fear that international co-operation on currencies was a thing of the past. But it raises two basic questions: whether the initiative can be expected to stick: and if so, how far it addresses preoccupations which have driven down world markets in the past few days. There are those who argue that US and German interest rates are respectively as low and as high as they are going to get. That could yet prove correct. But it is worth asking how far the present parities have answered the policy objectives in each country. The weak dollar was supposed to loosen monetary conditions in the US and stimulate exports. Judging by last week's trade figures, at least, it is scarcely doing its job. Equally, the high D-Mark was supposed to tighten conditions in Germany. Judging by the latest money supply figures, it is not working too well either. Granted, the dollar's plunge to all-time lows against the D-Mark has been an important element in the recent weakness of European markets. In a parochial UK context, it is worth noting that, as the chart shows, London has been moving closely in line with Continental markets ever since its post-election peak. For other ERM members besides the UK, the combination of high German rates and a weak dollar has had profoundly worrying implications for corporate earnings and dividends. It would also be wrong to push the parallels with the row between the Bundesbank and the US Federal Reserve in 1987, which played an important part in triggering Wall Street's historic collapse. Equity markets were then screamingly high in relation to bonds, inflation was rampant and corporate earnings were approaching their cyclical peak. In every respect, the situation is now reversed. But there are other forces afoot. Wall Street has been perceived as overvalued for so long that one tends to forget that it is so in fact. Nor is it quite clear how far the price allows for a Democrat in the White House. Tokyo is back below 16,000 on the Nikkei, which poses a threat no less real for being familiar. In Europe, the working assumption still is that the Maastricht treaty will go ahead. But aside from the little matter of the French referendum, it now looks not impossible that the unravelling of Italy's finances will cause disarray in the ERM rather more immediately. And from a UK viewpoint, it is not yet clear that a rise in interest rates is off the cards. Besides the risk of an increase in the German Lombard rate, the UK government's aggressive bidding for domestic savings may yet force a general rise in the mortgage rate. It is also somewhat disquieting that despite yesterday's sharp rise in the dollar against the D-Mark, sterling ended the day lower against the D-Mark than it started. In the end, one is left with the frustrating impression that world markets are in the grip of large fundamental forces which as yet are imperfectly identified. Since currencies are clearly part of it, it is much to be hoped that yesterday's bear trap proves effective. But it will not do the job on its own.</p>

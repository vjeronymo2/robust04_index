			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEIGHTY CONTROVERSY;  </P> <P> HEALTH: A SELF-STYLED CONSUMER HEALTH ADVOCATE LASHES OUT AT THE FAT CONTENT OF  MCDONALD'S PRODUCTS. BUT THE FAST-FOOD COMPANY SAYS THE ADS ARE RECKLESS AND  MISLEADING.  </P> <P> Nobody likes being called fat, including McDonald's.  </P> <P> The world's largest fast-food chain on Wednesday denounced full-page newspaper  advertisements that stated "McDonald's, Your Hamburgers Have Too Much Fat!" and  urged the company and other restaurants to reduce the fat in their hamburger  meat by 10%.  </P> <P> "It is reckless, it is misleading and we think it is intended more to scare  people than to inform them," said McDonald's spokesman Chuck Rubner.  </P> <P> The ads were paid for by Phil Sokolof, a wealthy Omaha, Neb., manufacturing  executive and self-styled consumer health advocate. His previous ads have  attacked the use of palm and coconut oils in cookies and other prepared foods.  </P> <P> After the publication of those ads last year and in 1988, numerous food makers  -- including Keebler and Pepperidge Farms -- agreed to cut back or eliminate  tropical oils, which are high in saturated fat. Saturated fat consumption can  increase cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease, many health officials  say.  </P> <P> In Wednesday's ads, which ran in newspapers that included the Wall Street  Journal and USA Today, Sokolof's National Heart Savers Assn. took aim at  saturated fats in beef and dairy products. Topped by a large headline that read  "The Poisoning of America," the ad urged readers to "Eat smaller portions of  leaner meats and lower fat dairy products."  </P> <P> The ad also said McDonald's Big Mac and a bag of french fries contain 25 grams  of saturated fats, and one ounce of Kraft American cheese contains 5.5 grams.  Most health guidelines recommend individuals limit daily saturated fat  consumption to 22 grams.  </P> <P> But McDonald's disputed Sokolof's claims, saying that it already uses lean beef  and that its Big Mac and fries contain anywhere from 15 to 19 grams of  saturated fat. The chain noted that the fat content of its hamburger meat  ranges from 17% to 19% -- not the 21.5% Sokolof claims in his ad.  </P> <P> McDonald's also announced that its U.S. outlets are in the process of  introducing low-fat milk shakes and frozen yogurt. Additionally, the chain is  testing a less fatty, 100% vegetable shortening to fry potatoes, which are  currently immersed in a combination of vegetable and animal fats.  </P> <P> "This continues this whole idea of the nutritional evolution of the menu," said  Rubner.  </P> <P> McDonald's was not the only one upset at Sokolof's ads.  </P> <P> "The way the ad is presented it tends to ignore the total diet," said Lisa Coe,  spokeswoman for the United Dairy Industry Assn. Coe noted that consumers can  balance their consumption of high fat foods with less fatty alternatives to  keep their total fat intake within recommended guidelines. "It's all a  trade-off."  </P> <P> Some newspapers, including The Times, refused to run the ad. Times spokeswoman  Laura Morgan said the paper rejected the ad because it was believed to be  unfair, and The Times feared the legal liability of running an ad that made  accusations against a particular company.  </P> <P> Sokolof -- who suffered a heart attack 24 years ago that he blamed on high  cholesterol levels -- and his high-profile campaign were supported by the  Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based advocacy group.  </P> <P> "His attempt to alert people to the dangers of saturated fat is a good one,"  said Jayne Hurley, the center's nutritionist. "Americans are eating way too  much saturated fat."  </P> <P> She noted that Sokolof's ads aimed at palm and coconut oils garnered more  attention and had more impact than years of studies and lobbying by her own  group.  </P> <P> "It certainly shows how effective one person with a lot of money can be," said  Hurley.  </P></p>

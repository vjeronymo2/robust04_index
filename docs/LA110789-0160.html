			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> MIKE SCOTT FLASHES SIGNS OF GREATNESS  </P> <P> The Waterboys' Mike Scott demonstrated Monday night at the Wiltern Theatre that  he is a wary but immensely worthy rock hero.  </P> <P> In his first local appearance in four years, the Scottish-born  singer-songwriter came armed with inspiring songs and uplifting musicianship,  but early in the show, he and the other six members of his band  self-defeatingly broke the momentum.  </P> <P> Yet Scott showed in the end that he has the conviction, purpose and talent to  put him near the forefront of contemporary rockers. The most significant aspect  of the concert was that Scott seems comfortable in that role. It wasn't always  the case.  </P> <P> When Scott burst on the scene in England in 1983, he seemed too eager to be  accepted as the latest in the rock-as-inspiration tradition of Bob Dylan and  Van Morrison. By the time of the third Waterboys album, 1985's "This Is the  Sea," Scott had moved toward warmer and more convincing expressions of  spiritually accented idealism and hope, and he stood on the brink of U2-like  adoration in England.  </P> <P> But Scott backed away for some soul-searching, eventually moving from London to  Ireland, where he put together a new band that enabled him to work with the  bright, flavorful Irish folk trimmings. The result was 1988's much-admired  "Fisherman's Blues" album, which had a far more personal tone that better  served his reflections on the search for social and spiritual fulfillment.  </P> <P> Monday's show at the Wiltern -- where Scott will appear again tonight and  Wednesday, before a concert Thursday at UC San Diego -- was an extension of  that breakthrough.  </P> <P> "We're livin' in a strange time / Workin' for a strange goal / We're turnin'  flesh and body / into soul," he sang in the evening's second number, "Strange  Boat," virtually defining his musical destination. But at times the Celtic  coloring (provided by such instruments as accordion, mandolin and fiddle)  neutralized the emotions of the songs, and the use of traditional numbers broke  the momentum of the Waterboys' own punchy songs.  </P> <P> At about the half-way mark, however, Scott picked up an electric guitar and  went into a series of explosive rockers that had the audience on its feet,  fully engrossed. By this time, the mixture of folk warmth and rock bite was so  unified that it seemed only natural when Scott brought out the nearly two dozen  members of the Scottish Fiddlers of Los Angeles for a jam that offered the  warm, communal feel that is such a winning feature of Los Lobos concerts.  </P> <P> Scott needs a few more songs of the level of the "Fisherman's Blues" material  before he can be reasonably ranked with the models he so much admires, but he  flashed signs of greatness on Monday.  </P> <P> A complete review of the Waterboys' concert will appear in Wednesday's Calendar  section.  </P></p>

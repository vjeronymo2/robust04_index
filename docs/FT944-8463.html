			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Markets): Market buoyed ahead of the Fed - London / Buy-backs boost sentiment Anticipation can prove more pleasurable than the real thing, and so it proved with this week's long-awaited rise in US interest rates. Having decided that a further tightening by the Federal Reserve would prove beneficial to bond and share prices, London equity traders appeared to get most of their celebrations in ahead of the event. The FT-SE 100 gained 19.4 points on Monday and a further 40.1 points by Tuesday's close, when the City still did not know by how much the American rates would rise. News that the US authorities had gone for a higher-than-expected increase of three-quarters of a percentage point kept the market moving ahead on Wednesday, but profit-taking set in and the FT-SE ended the week at 3131, up 55.1 points. London's buoyancy was not just due to growing confidence that the Fed would act. The equity market also benefited from a clutch of strong corporate results and optimistic economic indicators which suggested that the UK is continuing to enjoy strong economic growth, combined with low inflation. Boots, the retailer, drew plaudits on Monday for deciding to sell its prescription drugs business for about Pounds 850m to BASF, the German chemicals and drugs group. The company had long been thought too small to compete in the drugs industry, and analysts welcomed its decision to concentrate on retailing. Boots became even more popular the next day when it spent Pounds 508m buying back 10 per cent of its shares on the stock market. This will boost earnings per share, and helped alleviate any concerns that the company would do something rash with the proceeds of its pharmaceutical disposal. One should not get carried away with enthusiasm, however. In common with other retailers, Boots is facing a very demanding market. Although official figures said retail sales last month were slightly higher than last year, the rate of growth has slowed and price competition remains intense. Retailers are expecting a tough Christmas, with bargain-conscious consumers spending carefully. Another fillip to market sentiment came when PowerGen, the privatised electricity generation company, raised its interim dividend by a whopping 27 per cent. PowerGen, which bought back 0.6 per cent of its shares earlier this year, said it was considering further buy-backs but was keeping its options open. The government is due to sell off its remaining 40 per cent stakes in both PowerGen and National Power, the other listed generating company. National Power said it would spend more than Pounds 500m on buying back 8 per cent of its shares through the government offer. A buy-back might not help the cause of wider share ownership, but it will enhance earnings per share - and thus generate more cash for the Treasury by increasing the value of its stake. Another company to benefit from recovery was British Steel, which quadrupled its interim dividend after seeing pre-tax profits bounce from Pounds 27m to Pounds 159m. The group said second-half prospects were encouraging, with steel demand in the UK and continental Europe expected to grow by about 5 per cent this year. Most of the week's economic indicators were encouraging, with news of better than expected figures for UK inflation, unemployment and public sector finances. This must have been music to the ears of Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, as he puts the finishing touches to his November 29 Budget. Clarke sought to calm concern that the US interest rate rise would lead to an immediate increase in UK base rates, saying on Wednesday that 'at the moment, we have things well under control'. But the odds on another tightening of UK borrowing costs shortened again with yesterday's news that the British economy is now growing at its fastest rate for six years. One area of the economy that appears impervious to recovery is housing. A survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said the housing market remained stuck in the doldrums, with home-owners keeping properties off the market 'in a seemingly futile wait for meaningful house prices'. The survey of more than 100 estate agents said less than 5 per cent of agents in England and Wales reported price increases in the three months to October. Such gloom would not have surprised Roger Bootle, chief economist with HSBC, who this week published a 70-page study arguing that we could be seeing the end of the inflationary era. He believes the sustained moderate inflation in the post-war world was due to several structural changes - such as increased unionisation, industrial concentration and state ownership. But many of the factors which produced the persistent inflation had gone into reverse. He suggests the western world is approaching a new period of prolonged low inflation. A contrary view came from Bill Martin, economist with UBS, who says the chancellor's plans for a steady economic recovery could be quickly undermined. He says: 'Retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest) is expected to breach the prescribed 4 per cent ceiling in the second half of 1995, accompanied by a crisis jump to 10 per cent base rates as the pound flounders.' Is the UK economy really heading for a sustained period of low-inflationary growth, or will lack of capacity in the economy lead to over-heating and a traditional exchange rate crisis? The next week is bound to be full of pre-Budget speculation. But the outcome of this more fundamental debate will matter much more for UK equities than the exact timing of any interest rate rise - here or in the US.</p>

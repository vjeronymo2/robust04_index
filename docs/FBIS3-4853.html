The agency, citing its survey in Tokyo's 23 wards, said  prices declined from the year before for 16 of 20 items examined.    Perishables such as beef and bananas were sold at prices  lower than those at customs clearance but retail prices of  clothes such as shirts and brassieres were higher than customs  clearance prices, the agency said.    Retail prices of beef and bananas dropped 17.5 percent and  12.8 percent, respectively, from the year-earlier level and  their customs clearance prices were down 7.3 percent and 13.7  percent, respectively.    Prices of shirts and brassieres declined only 4.9 percent  and  5.6 percent from the previous year against price falls of 22.1  percent and 15.3 percent at customs clearance, the agency said.</p>

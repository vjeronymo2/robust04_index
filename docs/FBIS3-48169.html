"The main purpose of the Rev. Graham's visit is to discuss  problems related to the construction of a church in the  Najin-Sonbong area, designated by North Korea as a free economic  zone, and how to channel Christian funds for it," the source  said.    Graham, who visited North Korea in 1992, is scheduled to  arrive in Beijing on Jan. 22 and leave the Chinese capital the  next day aboard a North Korean airliner for Pyongyang, the  source said.    "As he did in 1992, Graham hopes to meet North Korean  President Kim Il-song and hold a service at Bongsu Church in  Pyongyang," the source added.    Graham conveyed a message from then U.S. President George  Bush to Kim Il-song and delivered a lecture at Kim Il-song  University when he visited North Korea between March 31 and  April 4, 1992, at the invitation of the Council of North Korean  Christian Churches.    Pyongyang has taken a series of positive measures to induce  church funds into North Korea as part of its efforts to prop up  its sagging economy. In this connection, there is a fundraising  campaign among ethnic Koreans in northeastern China to help  build a church in the Najin-Sonbong zone.</p>

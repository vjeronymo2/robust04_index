			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / China hopes loans will galvanise hinterland China plans to provide Yn10bn (Pounds 752m) in soft loans over the next six years to rural enterprises in remote areas in an effort to stop a widening economic and social gap between wealthy coastal regions and the hinterland, Tony Walker reports. These funds will augment Yn10bn earmarked for infrastructure projects in deprived areas. 'Ridding central and western China of their high poverty rates is a primary aim,' a State Planning Commission official told the China Daily newspaper. The move reflects growing concern in Beijing over the social and political costs of increasing disparities between rich and poor areas.</p>

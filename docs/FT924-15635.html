			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (31): Exemplary features - Consultant's Critique EFFICIENCY and charity are often felt to be poles apart. The processes of business are usually portrayed as hard and uncaring - especially the world of direct mail. The Children's Society faces the dilemma of what business it is actually in: is it a charity that depends on spontaneous generosity or is it a fundraising operation? If the former, is it ethical to use tools like database profiling and targetted mail shots? Should the charity simply pray and trust that 'God will provide' or does 'the Lord help those who help themselves'? There are no easy answers to this sort of question. What the Children's Society has tried to do is to use all the resources available in support of its overall goal - to help children. It uses its IT framework to support the whole realm of fundraising activities while still recognising that people are of supreme importance. The society recognises human frailties, such as the accurate filling in of forms - traditionally a nightmare. All the activities are voluntary, so the society has no sanction over its collectors. As a result, it has to have elabo- rate compensatory systems in place, such as the 'scrawly signatures' book. The most striking feature of this case for me was the excellent use of consultants. The Children's Society had recognised that it was not a software house, nor should it become one. Thus, it hired an outside consultant to design and carry through the initial implementation. Once the system was complete, the specialist skills of Mr Pritchard were no longer needed and he was released. Far too many companies use consultants for too short a period and never allow them to use their skills. Alternatively, they treat consultants like junior permanent staff and give them tasks to do which they could easily do themselves at lower cost. Another exemplary feature was the management of change demonstrated by Mr Beschizza. He described the initial phase as 'an arm round the shoulder' style of operation. Users were introduced to the computer as a tool not as an enemy and they were given lots of support. The final word on efficiency has to be the fact that both reporters left carrying a collecting box. Key points to note: Correct use of consultants' skills Full support and training of users during implementation Commitment from all levels of the operation.</p>

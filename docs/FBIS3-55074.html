In particular the letter notes  that "China became one of the first states in the world to  recognize Ukraine, establish diplomatic relations with it, and  open its embassy in Kiev. China's attitude to the development  of relations with Ukraine is highly valued in our young country.  The visits to China by Leonid Kravchuk, president of Ukraine,  and Ivan Plyushch, chairman of the Supreme Council, in this  short period of time have demonstrated this."    It was reported at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the  legal and contractual basis of inter-state relations between  both states has been elaborated much better than that with many  other states which had stronger links with Ukraine prior to the  break-up of the USSR. Twelve documents were signed during the  visit to China by Leonid Kravchuk in 1992 alone, some of which  have already been ratified by both parliaments. According to  information of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations of  Ukraine, according to the results for 1993, China is the leader  in the East Asian region in volume of exports from Ukraine. The  People's Republic of China purchases road technology, electrical  equipment, timber, cement, metal, pipes, fittings, and other  goods from us. The structure of products imported from China is  distributed almost evenly between products of light and textile  industries, products of the conversion of the Chinese  military-industrial complex, and agricultural produce.    A reception on the occasion of the second anniversary of the  establishment of diplomatic relations between the two states  took place at the embassy of the People's Republic of China in  Ukraine on 4 January. Yuriy Rylach, deputy minister of foreign  affairs of Ukraine, who was present at the reception, expressed  the hope for further fruitful development of interstate  relations. Ivan Drach, chairman of the "Ukraine" society; Petro  Myroshnykov, chairman of the Ukrainian-Chinese friendship  society; and Valentyn Lipatov, deputy minister of foreign  affairs of Ukraine, were also present at the reception. Zhang  Zhen, ambassador of the People's Republic of China in Ukraine,  thanked the guests from ministries and departments of Ukraine,  the active members of the Ukrainian-Chinese friendship society,  and representatives from business circles of the capital and  from the diplomatic corps for their attention and cooperation.</p>

			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / (CORRECTED) Survey of The Computer Industry (11): Take your partners and consolidate - UK, an industry still to be reckoned with Correction (published 25th April 1991) appended to this article. THE British computer industry is not what it once was. International Computers Limited (ICL) is owned by Fujitsu, Apricot has sold its computer hardware division to Mitsubishi, Sinclair Research is now part of Mr Alan Sugar's Amstrad computer organisation and Acorn Computers has long been part of the large Olivetti empire. That does not mean that it is no longer a force to be reckoned with. Not only have some British computer companies, notably Amstrad, survived the market consolidations of the 1980s, but leading international manufacturing facilities have come to the UK. In addition, smaller, home-grown companies with innovative hardware and software products, such as London-based Psion, have built their own specialist markets. This has taken place against a background of declining government investment in high technology, the opening up of European markets in preparation for 1992 and the push for development of open computer systems. ICL, for example, has been behind a push in both the public and private sector over the past few years to encourage the use and evolution of standard, open computer systems in the powerful mid-range and high-end mini and mainframe sectors. However, it seems that the open systems aren't always good news for UK computer interests. According to Mr Tim Taylor, marketing director of ACT-Logsys, it is open systems which played a large part in inducing Apricot to sell its hardware division to Mitsubishi. ACT-Logsys, a new company formed from a part of Apricot which was not sold off, specialises in consultancy and support for large public and private sector clients. 'One of the reasons we decided to find a partner for Apricot hardware was that with standardisation and globalisation, it was getting much harder for a UK supplier to survive on a worldwide scale,' says Mr Taylor. That search for a partner eventually led to Mitsubishi buying the company. He adds that the drive for standards has somewhat levelled the technology playing field and is forcing many of the smaller players to move into specialist markets to survive. Ironically, as computer companies founded by British nationals have either been sold or folded, international companies, such as Compaq Computer and Connor Peripherals have moved in to take their places. Compaq, in particular, has seen a spectacular rise to success for its UK company - headed by Mr Joe McNally, UK-born managing director. Mr McNally says that, in many ways, Compaq in the UK is just as much of a British company as ICL had been. Compaq has spent more than Dollars 76m on its Scottish manufacturing facility in the past three years. Compaq has built up an annual UK turnover in excess of Dollars 1bn thanks largely to a combination of the revenues generated by the factory and the company's sales in the UK. It was perhaps a sign of the times when Compaq found wholehearted and very senior UK government support for location of the factory in Scotland - although other Compaq European subsidiaries were lobbying heavily to have it elsewhere. Mr McNally recalls fondly one of the main elements in finally clinching the deal to build in Scotland. 'Former prime minister Mrs Margaret Thatcher personally put pen to paper and wrote to our US chairman Mr Rod Canion,' says Mr McNally. 'That played an important role in terms of him deciding to come here - although we did have a lot of support from the government and the Locate in Scotland office,' adds Mr McNally. He suggests that investing as heavily as it has in the UK has produced a lift in sales to public sector bodies, which have in the past largely turned to Apricot for their personal computers. He says that public sector sales for Compaq in the rest of Europe account for only 8 per cent of its business. In the UK, that figure has recently risen to 18 per cent. 'Clearly the Scottish factory has been an influence,' he suggests. But while Compaq is enjoying the benefits of increased public sector and corporate sales, the recession has hit the lower end of the PC industry hard, particularly in the retail sector. IBM-compatible PCs have become commodity consumer electronics products and suffer the same ups and downs as home fax systems, stereos and satellite television. Amstrad, British electronics company, for example, is feeling the bite of the recession. 'Business is not very good at the moment, but everyone is suffering,' admits Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad founder and chairman. 'But that's no consolation. It's been bloody slow and probably will be for the next six or seven months  -even if interest rates drop 2 or 3 per cent. It was a bad January and February and the satellite business suffered in February. Things are starting to move again, but not in the volumes we had before Christmas,' he says. Mr Sugar, however, has bounced back many times before and is expected to weather this recession well. At last month's CeBIT exhibition in Germany, he bullishly announced three new products - designed to help lift his share of the portables and small desktop computer markets and to pioneer participation in the colour laptop computing sector. Correction (published 25th April 1991). IN TUESDAY'S computer industry survey, we suggested incorrectly that Sinclair Research was part of the Amstrad organisation. In 1986, Amstrad purchased the right to use the Sinclair trade name together with Sinclair's intellectual property rights, patents and stocks of home computers. Sir Clive Sinclair, however, retained ownership of Sinclair Research.</p>

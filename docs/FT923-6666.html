			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Ratners Much of the horror of Ratners' delayed full-year figures had dripped into the market already. The stark feature of the report is the scale of management's mistakes which, as much as the recession, are responsible for the company's ills. Mr Gerald Ratner's ill-timed remarks about his products clearly had an impact on sales: turnover at the Ratners chain was down much more sharply than at the group's other stores. A second strategic error was the aggressive price-cutting promotion in the run up to Christmas, which helped prop up turnover but eliminated profits. The notion of Mr Ratner as a brilliant retailer laid low by financial problems clearly needs review. That, however, is the past. For the future the banks seem to have decided that the group has a chance of trading on a reasonably even keel, and that anyway disposing of the assets under current conditions would be extremely difficult. That idea is reinforced by the disclosure that the banks and the company may allow holders of the Ratners convertible with a put option to get their money this October, rather than triggering a default of the bonds and provoking a more widespread re-financing. Ratners will live to see another Christmas, although it may not be a pleasant experience. The strategy of cost cutting and better sourcing may be sensible but, with no encouragement from the economy, making any price increases stick will be difficult. A loss still seems likely this year, and while an operating profit is possible after that, delayed preference dividends are mounting up at some Pounds 27m a year. The idea of the shares as option money has not changed and, in any event, the company has only a stay until next June. If the business then is worth less than the accumulated debts, the banks may demand equity as the price of further support.</p>

			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> EL SALVADOR;  </P> <P> REBELS, GOVERNMENT BEGIN KEY TALKS  </P> <P> Negotiators for the Salvadoran government and leftist rebels began a key round  of talks in San Jose, Costa Rica, aimed at ending a decade of civil war.  </P> <P> The insurgents said it was up to the government to avoid violence by agreeing  to purge and restructure the army. Army officials meanwhile said the guerrillas  of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front attacked paramilitary civil  defense positions overnight. Rebel and government representatives agreed to a  series of talks last April in a U.N.-brokered accord, but the two sides remain  deadlocked over rebel demands for a purge of officers who, they charge, have  been involved in human rights abuses.  </P></p>

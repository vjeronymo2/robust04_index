			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["South Korean People's Cause of Independence, Democracy and </F> National Reunification Is Invincible" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The people's struggle  for independence, democracy and national reunification is going  on unremittingly in South Korea in spite of brutal suppression  and despicable intrigues by the fascist clique, and their desire  will surely be realized, says NODONG SINMUN in a by-lined  article today.    The article charges that the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique  under  the patronage of the U.S. imperialists are intensifying fascist  suppression of the South Korean students and other sections of  people who rose in struggle, while resorting to wicked intrigues  to disorganize their movement from within through its  reformation.    The article reads in part:    The puppet clique are, above all, trying to decompose the  fundamental nature of the South Korean people's movement as one  for independence, democracy and national reunification.    They let their stooges, venal scholars and pseudo activists  argue that there is no need to put up the slogan of  independence, democracy and national reunification in the South  Korean people's movement vociferating about the "change of the  times", and even contend that there cannot and should not be a  fight under the "civilian" regime.    Their argument that the slogan of independence, democracy  and  national reunification should not be put up in the South Korean  people's movement is, in essence, an extremely wicked and  cunning trick to deny and decompose the fundamental character of  the movement as one for anti-U.S. independence, anti-fascist  democracy and national reunification and to cut off the lifeline  of the movement boasting of scores of years of their unremitting  struggle.    The South Korean puppet clique also preach compromise with  the "civilian" regime, not head-on confrontation with it or a  fight for its overthrow.    Their talk that the Kim Yong-sam regime should not be  overthrown, but a compromise should be made with it, is, in the  final analysis, as good as saying the people should continue to  meekly obey the U.S. imperialists' colonial domination, not  complain about dictatorship and fascism and keep mum about  whatever they do against national reunification.    They preach "petition" and "nonviolence", encouraging  "dialogue" and "compromise", but it is a nonsensical talk under  such fascist system as that of South Korea where suppression is  going unhindered.    Their preach is an artifice to lull the anti-Kim Yong-sam  sentiments of the South Korean people, keep them from rising in  fierce struggles and, furthermore, to totally disarm their  movement and make them submit to the principle of non-resistance  and capitulationism.    The article stresses:    The South Korean people's desire cannot be realized so long  as such sycophant traitors, fascist dictators as Kim Yong-sam  are left alone.    The South Korean people, therefore, should kindle fiercer  flames of struggle to overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime  and establish a genuinely independent democratic regime.</p>

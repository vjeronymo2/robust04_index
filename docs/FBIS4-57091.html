			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 9 May (PL) -- Ernesto Melendez, minister  president of the State Committee for Economic Cooperation, has  said economic relations with Latin America have a promising  future because of the great potential for developing trade, the  sale of nontraditional products, and the assimilation of  investment.    In an interview with TRABAJADORES, Melendez noted that Latin  America is opening up to pharmaceutical and biotechnological  products and medical equipment, which constitute new Cuban  exports.    Melendez added that in terms of cooperation in the  production  sector, joint enterprises and associations linked to areas such  as construction, textiles, energy, the mechanical industry, and  services have been created.    Melendez labeled the process of joint economic activities  with Mexico, Venezuela, Chile, Argentina, Brazil, and Ecuador as  thriving, and he added that this process is expanding in the  Caribbean through trade relations with the Dominican Republic,  Jamaica, Guyana, and other nations.    Melendez emphasized the existence of a growing awareness of  the Cuban situation; new legislation; good training of its  workers, technicians, and professionals; and the efficient  infrastructure created within the past 30 years.    In terms of economic integration with Latin America and the  Caribbean, Melendez stressed that various models and free trade  agreements among countries of the region are being considered.  In this regard, Melendez said two aspects are being taken into  account: the need to promote joint investigations for economic  development and the understanding that this economic development  must take place amid social equity.    Melendez concluded by saying that the documents of the  Economic Commission for Latin America establish that more than  200 million people out of the area's total population of 450  million live in poverty, while the infant mortality rate is 57  per every 1,000 live births.</p>

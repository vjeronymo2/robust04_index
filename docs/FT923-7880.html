			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Plan to tighten law on political levy may be revived THE GOVERNMENT is prepared to revive plans to tighten the law governing trade unions' political funds. Senior Conservatives are warning that a move by Mr John Smith, the Labour party leader, to convert the unions' political levy payers into 'associate' Labour party members would prompt legislation to make it easier for individuals to refuse to make such contributions. The legislation would require unions to receive the written authority of each member before using any portion of their contributions for political purposes. Senior Labour figures accept that such a change could lead to a sharp reduction in the level of contributions. Under existing law individuals can contract out of payments to union political funds, which typically amount to just less than 10 per cent of annual dues. The system leaves thousands of 'passive' contributors to Labour finances who might choose not to pay if the law demanded their positive approval. Successive Tory governments have considered changing the law. The latest review was earlier this summer when Mr Michael Forsyth, the employment minister, pressed for its inclusion in the employment bill due later this year. The bill includes measures to tighten the rules on the direct deduction of union dues by employers but after what was described as a 'finely balanced' argument the government decided to defer again any move on the political levy. Now senior Conservatives are stressing that it would be 'unthinkable' to allow the present system of passive contributions to continue if Mr Smith used the levy system to boost the individual membership of the Labour party. One said: 'It would be impossible to justify the inertia in the system which already means that many Conservative trade unionists contribute to Labour.' The Tories add that a Labour suggestion that union levy payers would have to opt explicitly for associate party membership or would pay an additional fee would not discourage the government from changing the law. Labour is considering relaxing its rule that requires those in employment to join a relevant trade union before becoming a party member. The rule is thought to discourage a significant number of potential recruits to the party.</p>

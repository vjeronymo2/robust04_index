			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Shares in Montedison tumble by 5% SHARES IN Montedison, Ferruzzi's chemicals arm, fell nearly 5 per cent yesterday following suggestions that ENI, the Italian state oil concern, had taken their 1990 Enimont deal to arbitration. In November 1990, after long negotiations, ENI agreed to buy Montedison's 40 per cent stake in their jointly-run chemicals and petrochemicals group, Enimont. However, Ferruzzi denied the report in Il Mundo magazine that ENI was seeking up to L800bn (Dollars 580m) in compensation for the Enimont deal as 'gratuitously inaccurate'. ENI refused to comment. Arbitration procedures were built into the sale of Montedison's stake to ENI for L2,805bn; yesterday, ENI was coy about confirming whether it invoked the arbitration panel  - and, if so, in what context. The spotlight has also been turned on the Enimont affair, engineered when Mr Raul Gardini still headed Ferruzzi, after Rome magistrates reopened an enquiry into the treatment of minority shareholders. This enquiry is believed to have been prompted by magistrates following up leads on alleged political kick-backs in the wake of the Milan corruption scandal.</p>

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> DEPALMA'S DARK VICTORY  </P> <P> In the late '60s, TV coverage of the Vietnam War gave it the repetitiveness of  a bad dream. That's probably what Brian DePalma is after in "Casualties of War"  (citywide): a nightmare, reeking with blood, tears and cold sweat.  </P> <P> Taken from a real-life incident, DePalma's movie turns into a battle epic with  a screw loose. It conveys a sense of moral quagmire, of sinking into squishily  dangerous terrain, honeycombed with tunnels and traps, all hell exploding  around it. That's the imagery of the movie's first battle scene, a taut  prologue for a superb film.  </P> <P> DePalma may have found here the perfect arena for his darkly voluptuous  expertise. Working with a David Rabe script that uses Daniel Lang's New Yorker  reportage, he gets a bad-dream Vietnam. This isn't reality but hyper-reality:  war as experienced in the oscillations between fatigue and terror, or recalled  by someone fighting back the horror of his recollections. There's a moral  charge to the action, but it's also swooningly exciting, coldly scary. Every  friend may be an enemy, every innocent a traitor.  </P> <P> Lang's book revolved around a brutally shocking 1966 incident in which the  leader of a five-man reconnaissance squad, Sgt. Tony Meserve, informed his men  that, before setting out on their mission, they would kidnap a Vietnamese farm  girl, rape her en masse and then murder and dump her to cover their tracks.  Astonishingly, all the men went along with this plan, except for one upright  Minnesota farm boy, Sven Eriksson -- like the others, a fictitious name -- who  refused to participate and later tried to bring his squad mates to justice.  </P> <P> The horror of the premise soaks right into the movie's bones. In its scheme,  everyone is a casualty of war: not only the poor, brutalized girl but the men  themselves, turned by this hell into monsters or cowardly bystanders. The movie  contrasts two temperaments: Eriksson's thoughtful reserve, Meserve's posturing  bravado. And two styles of heroism: Meserve's undeniable bravery in battle, and  the moral courage Eriksson needs to report the crime. The story becomes a  battle between men who pervert the system to their own uses and others who, out  of passionate conviction, try to buck it.  </P> <P> Michael J. Fox and Sean Penn, who play Eriksson and Meserve, respectively, have  such dissimilar styles that, at times, they seem to be inhabiting different  movies. Fox, in his best dramatic performance to date, has the laid-back,  tamped-in, deferential quality of a skilled TV performer. Penn, on the other  hand, bursts the boundaries of his role with his gargoyle intensity, his  drilling gaze, his jaws perpetually chewing a plug of tobacco. Grabbing his  crotch or waving his rifle, he's like a young kid's parody of a warrior: a  macho paradigm.  </P> <P> The whole Vietnam episode is part of a reverie -- Eriksson's -- triggered when  he sees a woman who looks just like the victim Oahn (played by the same  actress, Thuy Thu Le). Meserve's excesses seem part of that nightmare; so do  the excesses of the rest of the cast. As the near-psychotic Clark, Don Harvey  has a werewolf glower and an ominous mad-dog grim. John Reilly's Hatcher is a  gangling, slack-jawed goof, Erik King's Brownie a florid clown and Ving Rhames'  Lt. Reilly a coldblooded rationalist.  </P> <P> "Casualties of War" is DePalma's 19th movie and easily his best. His detractors  saw his Hitchcock-pastiche thrillers as manipulative and sadistic, but here  he's not dealing with stylish slashers or bloody set-pieces. He doesn't have to  reach for a shock. He's dredging up a deeper horror: the hell that lies beneath  every man's skin, waiting to erupt.  </P> <P> There may be a conflict here between DePalma and Rabe's temperaments -- Rabe is  said to dislike the movie -- and, in a way, it's understandable. Rabe probably  tried to make the nightmare real; DePalma turned it back into a nightmare.  </P> <P> But that hallucinatory framework is what makes the movie uniquely his. The old  virtuosity is there -- the murderously complicated long-take tracking shots,  the macabre jokes at the edge of the frame, the deep-focus compositions. But  they're buried in the story, they don't draw attention to themselves. And the  themes and ideas are typical for DePalma too: the interplay of voyeurism and  guilt, the heroine who can't escape, the linkage of violence and repressed or  twisted sex, the obsession with a system's secret rot, with a nightmare taking  over your life.  </P> <P> "Casualties of War" questions the whole current movie idea of heroism in war:  the blood-spattered boy's fantasies and one-against-a-hundred lollapaloozas of  the '80s. Oddly enough, Meserve is more heroic and sympathetic in the movie  than he was in Lang's book; he saves Eriksson's life and staunchly ministers to  a dying black buddy (both fictitious episodes). We don't have the satisfaction  of regarding Meserve as a coward, a hypocrite, a phony; he's a good soldier  who's come to believe he has the right to rape and kill innocents.  </P> <P> "Casualties of War" (MPAA-rated R for sex and violence) is no indictment of the  American soldier -- indeed, Vietnam combat veterans may be among those most  moved by it -- but it is an indictment of the idea that individual brutality  can be cloaked by a system. For Eriksson, the horror of the episode was its  anonymity; he refused to let the girl suffer and die for nothing. That's the  bravest and finest part of the film, what all the people involved -- DePalma,  Rabe, Penn, Fox, composer Ennio Morricone, cinematographer Stephen Burum, all  of the cast and crew -- should be proudest of celebrating.  </P> <P> The heroism of the real-life Eriksson lay not in revenge, but in his devotion  to the victim. For all those who suffered or died anonymously in the juggernaut  of the Vietnam War, or any war -- or the victims in their mass graves, the  demonstrators shot down in a city square, the millions of bystanders caught and  killed in the cross-fire -- the movie makes its lonely plea. The leitmotif  Morricone uses for Oahn, the mournful pan flute that underscores her plight,  comes back like an anguished cry, pushed up past breath, past hope, the last  call of the suffering in a world in which death and horror are not only the  province of the night.  </P> <P> 'CASUALTIES OF WAR'  </P> <P> A Columbia Pictures release of an Art Linson production.

			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTHING SUBTLE ON EIFFEL TOWER 100TH BIRTHDAY  </P> <P> Early in the show, two men ablaze but in special asbestos suits will ascend the  Eiffel Tower while 53 others jump off it, tied by elastic cords.  </P> <P> Later, rock singer Johnny Halliday, known as "the French Elvis," will roar onto  a huge stage, built at the foot of the tower, in the company of 100  leather-jacketed motorcyclists and their bikes. From the stage, from barges in  the Seine, from holes in a giant birthday cake at the Palais de Chaillot, will  emerge music, dancers, tightrope walkers, fashion models, fireworks and laser  beams.  </P> <P> Finally, Ronald Reagan and his friend, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris will  unveil the 76-foot tall cake. One thousand chefs will pour out of the huge  pastry, with candles and slices of cake for le peuple.  </P> <P> Happy 100th birthday, Eiffel Tower! Happy 200th anniversary, French Revolution!  </P> <P> The cost of Mayor Chirac's 89-minute party tonight for several hundred thousand  guests: $10 million.  </P> <P> No matter, it seems. This is no time for prix fixe. This is a time of  Revolutionary excess and Bicentennial one-upsmanship in the French capital.  </P> <P> Not to be outdone by arch-rival Chirac, his opponent in a bitter presidential  election last year, President Francois Mitterrand, has invited President Bush,  29 other world leaders and an estimated crowd of 2 million to his own party for  the 200th anniversary of the storming of the Bastille, July 14.  </P> <P> The Mitterrand party, a parade that will include elephants, horses painted to  look like zebras and the Florida A &amp; M Marching Band doing the moon-walk  down the Avenue des Champs Elysees, is expected to cost $15 million.  </P> <P> Aides to Chirac and Mitterrand deny any revelry rivalry. However, Mitterrand  was not invited to Chirac's party tonight. Nor was Chirac invited to  Mitterrand's fete next month.  </P> <P> "There is absolutely no competition between the two," insisted Chirac aide  Thierry Aumonier. "It is a simple matter of protocol. It is the mayor of Paris  who invites. President Mitterrand was not invited."  </P> <P> Although the president was snubbed, Aumonier said Chirac did invite Minister of  Culture Jack Lang, a Mitterrand ally, "who will be given a position of honor  right next to Reagan."  </P> <P> Each show has an eccentric director with his own ideas of how to celebrate  history. Promoters for Chirac's Eiffel Tower party, directed by Olivier  Massart, describe it as an event that "combines Jules Verne and Fellini -- an  enormous naive event that mixes the wildest imagination with the glory of  industrial performances. Living artists mix with enormous pictures on  unpalpable screens."  </P> <P> Mitterrand's fete is more playful, reflecting the elfin personality of  Jean-Paul Goude, a veteran American and French advertising man.  </P> <P> "When I was a kid," said Goude, "I always dreamed of putting on a show at the  Theater of the Champs Elysees," a musical and dramatic theater near the famous  boulevard. "Now they have offered me the whole Champs Elysees. How could I  refuse?"  </P> <P> Goude's show will also benefit from Mitterrand's position as commander-in-chief  of the French military. In addition to 8,000 extras, 1,500 drummers and a  90-foot steam-belching train engine with 20 men pounding on oil drums, 3,000  French soldiers will join the parade.  </P> <P> Director Massart, who seems to be benefiting mainly from Chirac's friendship  with Reagan, will have 3,500 extras, 300 fashion models, 100 accordionists and  20 international stars, ranging from French crooner Charles Aznavour to Stevie  Wonder.  </P> <P> Each of the rival shows has problems. The Chirac spectacle will be rudely  interrupted by a commercial for Citroen, the French car maker. And Massart's  decision to install a "Noah's Ark" sequence in the middle of a historical  theme, which begins with the French Revolution, has left American television  director Walter C. Miller puzzled.  </P> <P> "Some of this stuff I simply do not understand," said Miller, part of the  American Radio City Music Hall team hired to hired to tape the show for  international television. "We go from the French Revolution to Noah's Ark. It's  just not chronological."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Too Tall for TV  </P> <P> Another worry for Miller, a veteran of big spectacles who staged the  inauguration of President Bush among other events, has to do with the tower  itself. The 1,000-foot-high tower, constructed by French engineer Gustave  Eiffel for the World's Fair of 1889, has a bad, as Miller put it in television  terms "aspect ratio." In short, it is too tall for television. There is no way  to show a performer and the tower at the same time. As a result, the performers  will appear on the small screen as though they are set before a jungle-gym, not  the whole magnificent iron-lace tribute to the dawn of the modern age.  </P> <P> Goude, meanwhile, is beset by political problems. The Chinese portion of his  "parade of planetary tribes" -- a giant drum pulled down the street by cyclists  with dancers from the Beijing Opera and flailing martial artists, was canceled  because of the recent political turmoil in China. Soviet officials objected to  Goude's idea of having Kremlin guards goose-stepping down the street to African  music while a ballerina danced with a bear.  </P> <P> Citizens from Brittany refused to march in a Goude scene that they claimed made  them look like comic strip characters. Their main objection appeared to be his  proposal that they should wear traditional Brittany bigoudenes -- starched  white head-dresses worn by women in the region -- but lit up with neon tubes.  </P> <P> Finally, Parisians of all stripes are fed up with both political leaders for  the inconvenience that their respective parties will cause drivers. For  Chirac's fete tonight, a 6.2-square-mile area in the heart of Paris has been  closed to all vehicular traffic.  </P> <P> Traffic restrictions will be even more severe for the Mitterrand Bicentennial  events. Mitterrand has complicated his celebration by inviting the leaders of  the world's other six richest industrial nations to hold their annual economic  summit here. He also invited dozens of leaders from the world's poorest nations  to meet with the rich nations' leaders.  </P> <P> Almost every leader will require a motorcade. Security will be intense. The  Paris police chief has said he will mobilize 30,000 police, compared to only  1,500 for the Chirac event. As a result, from July 10 to July 17, a huge  section in the center of Paris, from the Bois de Boulogne in the west to the  Louvre Museum in the east, will be closed to most traffic.  </P> <P> Fumed Le Figaro, a Paris-based newspaper that supported Chirac and not  Mitterrand in the presidential election last May:  </P> <P> "Ten million Parisians and inhabitants of the suburbs are preparing to live a  weeklong nightmare."  </P></p>

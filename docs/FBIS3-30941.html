General Gvero was told the decision by the Commander of  UNPROFOR Headquarters in Bosnia-Herzegovina British General  Angus Ramsey, judging the Serb control of convoy contents to be  "an infringement on the freedom of movement."    Due to many attempts at abusing these convoys, the Serb army  cannot let any convoys transit without controlling the contents,  Gvero stressed.    The Serbs also learn that the staff of the United Nations  High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) received orders to leave  their offices and territory of the Serb Bosnian Republic during  the day, Gvero continued.    "We are checking the information and if it turns to be true  we will prevent them from leaving our territory," the general  said.    "We reject any ultimatums, and we are ready as always to  cooperate as equals in a civilized way," Gvero said.    Gvero set out that neither of the latest UNPROFOR and UNHCR  measures was provoked by actions or behavior of the Bosnian  Serbs.    Humanitarian aid convoys for the Moslems have passed through  the territory of the Bosnian Serb Republic easily and safely,  the reports of UNPROFOR and UNHCR confirmed.    On the other side Moslems have often attacked and robbed  humanitarian convoys, one of the latest incidents happened in  Zenica (central Bosnia) when Moslems killed an Englishman,  humanitarian aid truck driver.    Gvero commented the decision as the intensification of  recent  different pressures on and threats to the Bosnian Serbs.    "We, as the whole civilized world, consider control as a  method of building confidence, not limiting of the freedom of  movement. It would not be good to create artificially in this  way situations conducive to incidents which would then serve as  a pretext for hasty reckless other actions," Gvero said in the  end.</p>

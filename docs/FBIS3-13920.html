The  Foreign Ministry says that the contacts between the two  countries were stopped in the wake of a decision by the prime  minister and foreign minister. Our political correspondent Udi  Segal reports, however, that political sources in Jerusalem  confirmed the report that contacts were held between the two  countries in a bid to prevent North Korea from supplying Iran  with long-range Nodong missiles.</p>

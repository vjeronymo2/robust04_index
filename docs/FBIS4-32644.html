			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 27 Jun (TANJUG) -- ``The Government of the  Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [FRY] expresses utmost concern  over a dangerous deterioration of the situation in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina caused by constant offensive actions by the  Muslim-Croat forces. The FRY Government expects that the UN  Security Council [UNSC] will without delay take appropriate  measures to prevent consequences that further negative  developments could have on the peace process in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    ``At this crucial time it is a prime responsibility and  obligation of the UNSC to ensure that a realistic chance to  reach a peaceful solution of the conflict in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina is not missed. If, however, this opportunity  is missed, this would bring about an inevitable escalation of  the conflict with all unforseeable consequences,'' a statement  by the FRY Government, made available to TANJUG, says. It adds:    ``The FRY Government finds the current stage of the  negotiations, which should lead to a solution of the crisis  caused by the civil war in former Bosnia-Herzegovina, crucial.  Active participation of the most important international powers  -- the United Nations, EU, United States, and Russia -- in the  search for a lasting political solution, acceptable to all three  sides in the conflict, gives rise to hope that this tragic civil  war will soon be stopped, which would in turn create conditions  for the resolution of some other important questions in the  former Yugoslavia.    ``The FRY Government expects that full advantage will be  taken of the current favorable period and is making efforts  towards contributing in a concrete manner to this effect.  Motivated by the desire to have a lasting peace in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina reached as soon as possible, the FRY  Government has welcomed the recent agreement on ending military  operations between the belligerent parties in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, an agreement on overall and  lasting cease-fire would be a real proof that all parties in the  conflict are indeed committed to a lasting, just peace and a  political solution to the crisis.    ``All the developments that ensued following the signing of  the agreement on 10 June 1994 indicate that not all sides in  former Bosnia-Herzegovina wish to accept a peaceful solution.  The setting- up of the Muslim-Croat federation in former  Bosnia-Herzegovina flared up ambitions of the radical Muslim  leadership in former Bosnia-Herzegovina to persist in its  orientation for a military settlement. Relying on the  unprecedented media support based on untruths, and also on a  strong support lent by certain international circles, the  Muslim-Croat side has been abusing the agreement on the  cessation of military operations and has openly been preparing a  large-scale military offensive, which is confirmed in UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Forces] reports. These reports show, among other  things, that the Muslim-Croat forces, despite the current  embargo, have been allowed an unhindered supply of a large  quantity of the most up-to- date weapons. All the activities of  the Muslim-Croat side involving regrouping forces and other  offensive actions, by which the signed agreement is violated,  are hereby most vehemently condemned by the FRY Government.    ``The regrouping of their forces, with the continuous  intensification of armed activities aimed at provoking the  continuation of the war, represent a flagrant violation of the  concluded agreement and can seriously threaten all efforts  hitherto made to restore peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina.  The Muslim- Croat forces recently began carrying out heavy  offensive actions against the Bosnian Serb positions, their  towns, along almost all frontlines, which has caused numerous  civilian casualties and huge material damage.    ``Despite all the aforementioned, it is encouraging that the  Bosnian Serb forces have so far retaliated in a restrained  manner to the Muslim-Croat offensive actions, thus preventing  the current military operations in former Bosnia-Herzegovina  from turning into a conflict of widest proportions.    "The FRY Government this time again wishes to stress that a  permanent peace in former Bosnia-Herzegovina can be achieved  through negotiations alone, and is calling on the international  community to exert pressure and demand from those violating the  agreed cease-fire to halt their military activities immediately  and accept peace as the only option without delay," the Yugoslav  Government's statement says in conclusion.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Pirelli to stop making truck tyres at Burton Pirelli, the Italian tyres and cables group, is ending truck-tyre production at its Burton on Trent headquarters in Staffordshire, with an expected loss of 350 jobs. The move is part of a Europe-wide restructuring of Pirelli's tyre operations, prompted partly by the worst slump in continental Europe's commercial vehicle markets since the second world war. Truck tyres supplied by Burton will instead come from the group's main manufacturing centre near Turin and from new facilities at its Izmit plant in Turkey. Only about 40 per cent of Burton's truck-tyre output is sold in the UK, the bulk going to European markets. The move comes almost exactly a year after Pirelli, the world's fifth-largest tyre maker, announced the closure of car-tyre production at Burton and its transfer to its other large UK manufacturing facility at Carlisle, Cumbria. That move cost more than 600 jobs at Burton, where the group for many years has been the largest employer. After truck-tyre production ends - expected by August - about 450 employees will remain. They will comprise headquarters staff and those engaged in logistics, general rubber goods, compounding and retreading. The restructuring means further expansion at the Carlisle plant, which employs about 800. At least 30 Burton manufacturing employees are expected to relocate to Carlisle, and this figure may be increased by Carlisle workers taking up a voluntary-redundancy and early-retirement programme being offered at both centres. Pirelli is spending 'several million' pounds on increasing capacity at Carlisle, where Burton's substantial technical and research and development facilities are also being relocated. Mr John Tierney, personnel director, said yesterday that Carlisle would play an expanded product-development role in Pirelli's European operations. During the next four years fabric and compounding activities, employing about 80 people, are also to be transferred to Carlisle from Burton.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Police open fire on 'homeland' demonstrators Riot police fired at demonstrators in the South African black 'homeland' of Bophuthatswana for the second day running yesterday as a civil service strike paralysed the government of increasingly embattled homeland leader President Lucas Mangope. At least 32 people were wounded, witnesses said. The homeland government said a police officer was killed. President Mangope, who yesterday closed down the broadcasting service and sacked all of its staff, rejected a request from the Independent Electoral Commission to allow campaigning and polling for the April elections to take place in the homeland. Bophuthatswana said earlier this week it would not participate in these elections. As teargas drifted toward the government offices from the nearby University of Bophuthatswana, Finance Minister Ephraim Keikalame admitted candidly to journalists: 'It is not possible to have an effective functioning government under these circumstances.' Almost the whole of the public service appeared to be on strike, including essential services like hospitals, but telephones and electricity continued to function. The capital's main hospital complex was deserted by staff, with some patients lying unattended. Outside the university, pol-ice armoured vehicles roared up and down throughout the day, firing teargas cannisters and rubber bullets at students barricading the entrance gate. The rioting provoked a threat of direct South African intervention, with the Transitional Executive Council, the multi-party body overseeing government in the run-up to elections, saying it would give President Mangope a week 'to change his attitude' after which steps would be taken to force reincorporation.</p>

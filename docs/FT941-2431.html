			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Observer: Full circle Meanwhile, Lord Walker of Worcester, Britain's first environment minister, must feel a sense of deja vu at his party's latest U-turn on out-of-town shopping centres. Back in 1971 Peter Walker, as he then was, attended a conference of the cities in Indianapolis where he learned first hand about the social problems caused by US shopping malls in terms of unnecessary congestion and inner city decay. On his return to Britain he issued a circular to local authorities urging them to resist the advances of hypermarkets. If John Gummer, the environment secretary, wants to give local authorities further guidance on the perils of out-of-town shopping he could do a lot worse than re-issue his predecessor's advice. Probably only needs a change of date.</p>

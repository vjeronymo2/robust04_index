			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAZZARD AND UCLA AGREE TO SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Walt Hazzard, former UCLA basketball coach, has reached an agreement with the  school over settlement of his contract.  </P> <P> Hazzard, who was fired by the Bruins in March, 1988, after four years as coach,  had two years left on the contract.  </P> <P> Hazzard will work as a development officer at UCLA under the supervision of  Vice Chancellor Winston Doby. He will be involved in the university's Young  Black Scholars Program, which helps academically gifted high school students,  and with a special development program on the elementary school level.  </P> <P> Hazzard was in Maryland Friday and unavailable for comment but he released a  statement that said:  </P> <P> "I believe America's greatest natural resource is our youth and I am committed  to helping the young people of our country and especially those of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "We have to change all their negative directions to positive, and I will spend  all my energies to help accomplish that goal. I am obviously delighted to be  doing this work in association with UCLA."  </P> <P> Although details of the settlement were not revealed, Hazzard's attorney, Jerry  Roth, said, "UCLA met all its obligations (under terms of the original  contract).  </P> <P> "When I was working with (UCLA counsel) Patricia Jasper, we worked on the  assumption that we were going to get this thing resolved in a way that would be  positive both for the university and for Walt. We all feel that that was  accomplished with this settlement.  </P> <P> "Walt has had an association with the university since he was an undergraduate,  and so much of his identity comes from UCLA.  </P> <P> "I think the school appreciates that he ran his program with integrity,  whatever the reasons why he was dismissed."

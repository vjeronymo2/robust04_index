			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Letter: Private View obscures complexity of living species Sir, The Private View interview with Claude Martin, the new director of World Wide Fund for Nature (July 9/10), seemed to miss the point. Dr Martin might have been asked if the Panda symbol was not now so prominent that it obscured the complexity and importance of the work that goes on under its logo. Pandas and other 'cuddlies' have long been the advertising front for funding of a lot of hard-headed thought and work on the diversity of life on earth, from viruses to vertebrates, and the relationship of that diversity with the economic, ethical and spiritual life of humans. Each living species is more complex than any man made machine. Very few individuals of any species are the same, and their inter-relations so intricate as to be largely beyond human elucidation. To demand the moral justification of conserving the angonoka tortoise is as irrelevant as a Tory government asking the same question about any particular small business during a time of depression. Given the bent of the FT, a deeper examination might have been appropriate: of Martin's view on the implications of taking funds from industrial and economic interest groups; on environmental action by industry; and upon ensuring the continued availability of biological resources to man. These are complex and important issues and their treatment in your feature may be likened to an interview with the chairman of the stock exchange on the simplistic and outmoded basis that he oversaw a casino and that capitalism contained the seeds of its own destruction.

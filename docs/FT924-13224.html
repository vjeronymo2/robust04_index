			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / North West challenges Ofwat on price increase NORTH WEST WATER was the only water and sewerage company to challenge by last night's deadline the request of Ofwat, the water industry regulator, to hold back next spring's price rises. North West said it had issued a counter-notice - a formal appeal - to Ofwat's statement two weeks ago that if it held back prices as much as Ofwat had asked it would not be able to afford to clean up the Mersey as required by new environmental rules. Two weeks ago Ofwat told the 10 large water and sewerage companies and nine of the 22 smaller water-only companies that they should hold back next spring's price rises by an average of 2 percentage points. Their licences allow prices to rise each year by the rate of inflation plus a 'K' factor, but Ofwat has argued that construction costs have been lower than expected because of the recession, and that the benefits should reach consumers. It gave the companies until midnight last night to respond. Mr Clive Elphick, North West's general manager for economic regulation, said: 'We have had to spend Pounds 430m more than planned - an extra year's spending - between 1989 and 1994.' Thames, Severn Trent, Anglian, Northumbrian, Wessex and Yorkshire have not issued counter-notices. They have, however, persuaded Ofwat in the past two weeks that they should hold back prices by between 0.4 per cent and 1 per cent, less than half the level that Ofwat originally requested. Of those, Anglian, Thames, Northumbrian and Yorkshire have struck two-year deals with Ofwat, so they will avoid further changes before Ofwat's wide-ranging review of the industry pricing structure in 1994. Southern Water is the only company to have agreed a higher 'K' with Ofwat. Its prices will rise next spring by inflation plus 3.9 per cent, against 3.5 per cent last year. Mr Graham Hawker, managing director of Welsh Water, said: 'We told our customers in June that we would hold back prices by 1.5 per cent, and Ofwat has agreed that, so we have not sent a counter-notice.' Last night South West Water had not issued a counter-notice or completed discussions with Ofwat. Lex, Page 24</p>

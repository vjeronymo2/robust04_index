			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / Whitbread gives equal rights: Philip Rawstorne on the UK brewer's changes to its share structure and investment activities WHITBREAD, the UK brewing, retailing and leisure group, yesterday announced proposals for reforming its 45-year-old share structure to give equal voting rights to all shareholders. It also intends to acquire the 51 per cent outstanding stake in the Whitbread Investment Company, an associate set up in 1956 to protect a number of regional brewers from takeover. The share offer values WIC at about Pounds 482.6m, or 765p a share, with a cash alternative worth 742p. WIC's shares rose from 690p to 743p yesterday. Sir Michael Angus, Whitbread chairman, said the moves would bring the share structure into line with other leading public companies and provide greater flexibility for the group. 'These two transactions will reinforce the transformation which has taken place at Whitbread in recent years.' Institutions have long pressed for changes in the outdated dual-share structure, which has given holders of B shares 20 times the votes of A holders. It was devised as a safeguard against takeover when Whitbread was a family-controlled brewer. But today the family holds only 10.8 per cent of the voting rights. A single class of shares will now be created by a capitalisation issue giving 1.27 new A shares for every B share to compensate for the elimination of the superior voting rights. The move will give Whitbread easier access to market funds as well as providing shareholders with greater liquidity and marketability of their shares. Sir Michael said: 'It is our intention to make further investment in the development of our businesses and to make further acquisitions.' Whitbread will review its options on WIC's investment portfolio, worth more than Pounds 250m after the deal. It seems likely to sell stakes in leading UK brewers and retailers, such as Guinness (Pounds 10m) GrandMet (Pounds 7.8m), Bass (Pounds 6.6m) and Allied-Lyons (Pounds 4.5m), as well as smaller holdings in companies such as Rank, Forte and Cadbury Schweppes. Compliance with government orders will require stake reductions in Marston, Boddington and Brakspear. Whitbread B shares fell from 1388p to 1200p yesterday, while the A shares closed unchanged at 534p. Both closing prices were in line with the formula for valuing WIC, whose 30 per cent stake in Whitbread is being unwound. Lex, Page 24</p>

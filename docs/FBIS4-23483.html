			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by Justice Minister Dullah Omar on the </F> SAPA PR Wire Service on 7 June]    [Text] 1. On 27 May 1994 an indication was given to  Parliament of thinking within government on the need to set up a  commission of truth and reconciliation to enable South Africa to  come to terms with its past.    I reiterate that reconciliation is not simply a question of  indemnity/amnesty and letting bygones be bygones. If the wounds  of the past are to be healed, if a multiplicity of legal actions  are to be avoided, if future human rights violations are to be  avoided - and indeed -- if we are to successfully initiate the  building of a human rights culture -- disclosure of the truth  and its acknowledgement are essential.    We cannot forgive on behalf of victims -- nor do we have the  moral right to do so. It is the victims themselves who must  speak. Their voices need to be heard.    The fundamental issue for all South Africans is therefore to  come to terms with our past on the only moral basis possible  namely that the truth be told and that the truth be acknowledged.    International human rights norms and standards and other  international experiences provide us with guidance.    2. In finalizing our proposals we are considering the  following    matters:    (i) Composition of the commission the commission should  consist of eminent respected South Africans and must be broadly  representative.    (ii) The terms of reference of the commission would include  investigating and establishing the truth about human rights  violations and their acknowledgement. Gross violations of human  rights must be fully and officially investigated with due regard  to fair procedures. The identity of the victims and what  happened to them, and the identity perpetrators must be made  known. There must, as indicated, be both knowledge and  acknowledgement. The events need to be officially recognized and  publicly revealed. Truth telling responds to the demand for  justice for the victims and facilitates national reconciliation.    (iii) Fair procedures: The commission should perform its  task  and responsibilities on the basis of fair procedures and the  adherence to international law relating to human rights must be  assured.    (iv) Reparation/compensation: This is another difficult  matter. However, a framework needs to be created to deal with  all claims -- especially those based on gross violations of  human rights with the power to bring finality to such matters --  it being borne in mind that it is the democratic government that  will have to bear the financial burden.    (v) Time frame: The commission is to complete its work  within  a prescribed period of time for example 18 months or two years.    (vi) Reporting to the nation: There should be reports  submitted to the president from time to time as well as a final  and complete report after which the president shall report to  the nation and thereby close this chapter on South Africa's past.    3. Amnesty/indemnity    It is in the above context that legislation should make  provision for amnesty/indemnity.    (i) The commission may set up a specialized structure to  deal  with all applications and make recommendations.    (ii) The cut-off date in respect of offences committed will  be no later than 5 December 1993.    (iii) The offences in respect of which amnesty may be  applied  for will be defined strictly within the framework of the  constitutional provision on national unity and reconciliation.    (iv) The recommendations of the commission shall be referred  to the president whose decision will be final.    (v) There will be a fixed cut-off date for applications. All  persons seeking amnesty/indemnity will be required to submit  applications by not later than such date.    4. Participation    Participation in the process will help the nation to heal  itself. Whilst the above represents the thinking within  government, individuals, organizations, religious bodies and  members of the public generally are invited to submit their  comments and proposals by 30 June 1994 to the Ministry of  Justice before legislation is finalized. Such comments,  suggestions and proposals will receive consideration in the  finalization of legislative proposals which will then be placed  before the cabinet.    5. Outstanding applications    Whilst we are in the process of preparing legislation along  the lines set out above, there exists great concern about the  various applications for indemnity submitted under the existing  indemnity laws to the previous government. Such applicants have  an expectation that their applications will be processed and  finalized in terms of the existing indemnity laws.    I agree that these applications cannot await consideration  until a new law is passed. Hence consideration of all such  applications under the existing indemnity laws will be  expedited. An advisory committee under the convenorship of Mr  Brian Currin, national director of Lawyers for Human Rights will  be set up immediately. Its task will be to scrutinize all such  outstanding indemnity/amnesty applications which are still  pending and to make appropriate recommendations to the state  president. Those who qualify in terms of the two indemnity laws  will be released immediately. Those who do not qualify will,  together with the new applicants be given an opportunity to  apply for amnesty through the new mechanisms which are being  established in terms of the constitution.    Issued by the Ministry of Justice    Cape Town 7 June 1994</p>

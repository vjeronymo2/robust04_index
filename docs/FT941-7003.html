			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Markets: The importance of a long-term view - Serious Money The falls this week in equity and bond markets should remind investors yet again how the value of their holdings can go down as well as up. Many do not need reminding, of course - you do not need a long memory to recall the stock market crash of 1987. Falls and rises of the order we have seen in the past few days are, in any case, very small compared with 1987. Indeed, it is too easy to regard every fall of any significance as a 'crash' and every rise as a 'boom.' This week's market movement should not upset investors unduly. Many who went into UK equities even as recently as the beginning of 1993 will have made sizeable gains. But the latest decline underlines the importance of regarding equities as a long-term investment, precisely in order to be able to ride out temporary setbacks. Unit and investment trust savings schemes show their worth at these times, not only because they give investors the discipline of putting aside some money regularly but because, by doing so, they are able to buy more units or shares when the stock market falls and fewer when it is high. This 'pound/cost averaging,' as it is known in the trade, means investors do not have to worry about getting market timing right - something which often defeats even the experts. Fund management houses are only too aware of the fears investors have about protecting their capital. This has led to a proliferation of so-called guaranteed equity products; in most cases these promise that, even if the worst happens, people get back their original investment. Now, a group of former Kleinwort Benson fund managers - calling itself Objective Unit Trust Management - has launched a new unit trust which aims to limit the risk of investing in the stock market. The Objective Limited Risk Equity Fund will use derivatives to protect against stock market falls. The fund is managed so that the bid price (that obtained by investors for selling units) at the end of each six-month period will not fall by more than 5 per cent. The initial period starts on the first business day of March. The fund managers say that, to reduce risk, they will spread exposure across the markets so that 50 per cent is invested in the UK and the rest is divided equally between the US, Europe, Japan and the Far East. The fund shares a common disadvantage of all guaranteed equity products in that the investor does not benefit from the full rise in the market - this is the price paid for the protective mechanism. But, unlike guaranteed equity bonds which tend to have a lock-in feature over five years, this fund will lock-in gains every six months and investors are free to buy and sell units at any time. Initial charge is 4.5 per cent and annual management fee is 1 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 2,000. * * * Fears this week of interest rate rises in the longer term pushed up rates on the money markets where the building societies borrow funds for fixed-rate mortgages. By Thursday night a number of lenders - including the Halifax, Leeds, and Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester - had axed their existing fixed-rate mortgages. Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester withdrew its 6.99 per cent, five-year fixed rate while Leeds replaced a 5.85 per cent, two-year mortgage with two of 6.19 and 5.99 per cent (the cheaper one is for those borrowing only 80 per cent of the value of the property). Two five-year mortgages of 6.75 per cent and 6.95 per cent were replaced with ones of 7.39 and 7.59 per cent. Halifax has increased fractionally its old 7.2 per cent, five-year fixed rate to 7.25 per cent, but its 10-year rate goes up from 7.99 to 8.25 per cent. Yesterday, the National Westminster bank withdrew a number of recently-issued fixed rates; one had been a particularly attractive 10-year fix at 7.59 per cent, which was lower even than standard variable rates. Leeds also withdrew another mortgage, this time its 25-year, 8.99 per cent fix. Last week, I wrote that there was a danger that good fixed rates would begin to disappear, especially since lenders were shifting the emphasis back to variable rate loans. This is partly because the margin on variable rates is much higher than on fixed rates. Although six in 10 new mortgages are fixed rate, perhaps as many as 90 per cent of all mortgages are still on a variable rate. But if your lender offers a good fixed rate, there is nothing to stop you fixing all or part of the mortgage to give some security against rising interest rates. Avoid those which are tied to insurance-related products and make sure you calculate if the costs involved in re-mortgaging are outweighed by the interest savings. Many analysts still expect the next interest rate movement in the UK to be downwards, but rates will rise again as one cycle comes to an end and the next begins. There is always a chance that fixed rates may decline further, but they may not have scope to fall very far. Unless you intend to pay down your mortgage over the coming years (capital repayment incurs early redemption penalties), it is a good time to fix your mortgage.</p>

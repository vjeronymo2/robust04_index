			<p>BFN     [Text] Nigerian Ambassador to Havana Y. Alhassan stated  today in Havana during a news conference that his government  will maintain its peaceful policy, but will be firm against any  attack from the Republic of Cameroon.    The Nigerian ambassador provided broad information on the  border conflict between the two countries in the Bakassi  peninsula zone which has always belonged to Nigeria, as  confirmed by several treaties, although Cameroon is now  expressing some designs on this territory.    The ambassador added that the strengthening of Nigerian  forces, to maintain order in that region, has been  misinterpreted by the neighboring country, which conducted three  military attacks in February 1994. He added that Nigeria will  never be the first to attack, but that its armed forces are  prepared for anything.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A new legal regulation to improve the labor  disability report is in effect nationwide following the issuance  of Resolution No. 52 of the Public Health Ministry [Minsap]. The  resolution clearly states the great responsibility borne by  those who are selected to disability panels because their  decisions are significant in political, economic and social  terms: first, because their decisions will impact the  implementation of one of the most significant accomplishments of  the Revolution, social welfare; second, because it implies  making retirement payments to disabled workers; third, because  when a worker leaves the labor force, the impact goes beyond the  public health sector.    These are the bases for the current dispositions of the  labor  disability report contained in the new Minsap resolution. It is  known that prior to this regulation, superficial and even  fraudulent evaluations were quite frequent. These evaluations  determined partial, total, or permanent disability status on the  basis of friendship or bribes, although we do not want to allude  to the majority of the cases evaluated in the past. The  determinations issued from now on, however, must consider the  age, sex, specific work load, risk factors, and physical  capability of the workers according to the injury in question,  in order to determine if it is a case of total or permanent  disability for their current work, or partial or permanent  disability for other work.    The performance of these disability panels will be examined  periodically and their members will be evaluated annually on the  fulfillment of their duties. If violations are detected, and  they have social repercussions detrimental to the prestige of  the medical practice, the case will be brought to the public  health minister to determine suspension or banning from medical  practice.</p>

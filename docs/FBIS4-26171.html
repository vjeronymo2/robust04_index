			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li  Peng presided over a meeting here today to draw up detailed  plans for flood relief and prevention work in some southern  Chinese provinces and autonomous regions.    Other Chinese Communist Party and government officials,  including vice-premiers Zou Jiahua and Li Lanqing, took part in  the meeting.    Instructions from Chinese President Jiang Zemin on the  current flood control and relief work were passed on at the  meeting.    Participants also listened to reports about the present  anti-  flood and relief work from departments such as the State Flood  Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, the Ministry of Water  Resources, the Ministry of Civil Affairs, the State Planning  Commission, the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture,  the Ministry of Finance and the Central Meteorological Station.    In April and May, serious floods occurred in east China's  Jiangxi and Fujian provinces, and in central China's Hunan  Province. Entering June, the most serious floods were reported  to have occurred on the Xijiang River of southwest China's  Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the Beijiang River in south  China's Guangdong Province and Xiangjiang River in Hunan  Province. A large number of areas have been affected.    Premier Li said the Chinese Communist Party Central  Committee  and the State Council were paying close attention to the flood  situations in these areas.    Party and government departments of all levels in the  affected areas are all mobilizing the cadres and ordinary  citizens, the Chinese [People's] Liberation Army men and the  armed policemen to help prevent and control floods, as well as  to provide relief in disaster-hit areas.    To make a success of flood control and disaster relief work,  the meeting has also decided to send special working groups,  formed by Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua, Wen jiabao, member of the  secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,  and State Councillor Chen Junsheng, to join local officials,  army men and local people in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan and  Jiangxi in flood control and disaster relief work.    The Chinese premier stressed that the priority of current  flood control work should be to guarantee the safety of the  grand embankment along the Beijiang River and embankment  projects in Zhujiang (Pearl) River delta, to rescue residents  besieged by floods as quickly as possible, and to ensure that  people in flood-hit areas have enough to eat and wear and to  prevent epidemics breaking out.    The premier also urged local officials to help people to  resume production as soon as possible and rebuild their  communities.    The flood control work of this year has just begun and the  main flood season starts in late July and early August, while  serious droughts were also reported to have hit some other  areas, said the premier, urging that different localities must  be well prepared for major floods and the most serious droughts.</p>

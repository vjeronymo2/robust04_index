			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "ALKAN and LATECOERE Associated for </F> Composites"]    [Text] ALKAN and LATECOERE are planning an industrial  cooperation agreement covering composite structures for  aeronautical applications and other armament and industrial  uses. They will be employing the unique SIMS (Structures  Integrales Monolithiques a pointe singliers) [Integral  Monolithic Single-point Structures] and RAC (Revetements contre  Agressions des Composites) [Coating against Agression by  Composites] process. ALKAN has developed much knowhow as well  as specific processes for the conception of primary non-bonded  structures. Applications now in development include the oil  tank of the GE90 built in partnership with SNECMA, a pod pylon  for the Rafale, flanges for aircraft wheels, tank rollers, etc.  For many years LATECOERE has been investing in equipment and  activities aimed at composites and has now attained a high  competitive level for plan layout and production. LATECOERE is  a partner in making important structural composites for the  CFM56, thrust reversers for the V2500 and parts for the MD11,  Falcon 2000 and Airbus.    The Boards of Administration of the respective firms have  given agreements of principle to cooperation being organized in  the form of an Economic Interest Group, or risk-sharing  partnership, now being fine-tuned. It will open the way to a  pooling of work and facilities for improved market position.  ALKAN/LATECOERE -- Contact: Mr. B. Javary - Phone  33-1-43-89-39-90, Contact: Mr. H.

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes ease oil licence terms Denmark has eased the terms on which oil companies are invited to apply for licences to explore for hydrocarbons in the Danish sector of the North Sea in the country's fourth licensing round. The new terms have been approved the Folketing (Parliament) energy committee. Compared with the third licensing round in 1989, they have been altered significantly: no royalty payment is required; companies will not be required to apply for low as well as high risk acreage; there will be no right of first refusal to buy oil and gas by the state oil distribution company; and no special requirements concerning research, development and training. There will be obligatory 20 per cent state participation, but the state oil company, Dansk Olie og Naturgas, will pay its share of the exploration costs and there will be no sliding scale allowing the state company to increase its share if a commercial find is made. The acreage opened in the fourth round is in the extreme western tip of the Danish area, adjacent to areas where finds have already been made. Output from the Danish fields last year reached 9.3m tonnes of crude oil, plus 4m tonnes oil equivalents of gas, slightly more than Denmark requires for its own needs.</p>

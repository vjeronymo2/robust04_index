			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a banquet held in honor of visiting Philippine  President Fidel Ramos in Hanoi, SRV President Le Duc Anh said:  On behalf of the Vietnamese state and people, I warmly welcome  President Fidel Ramos, the first President of the Philippines on  an official friendship visit to Vietnam, and other distinguished  Philippine guests.    We are pleased to note that the relations of friendship and  multifaceted cooperation between our two countries, during the  past period, have consistently strengthened and expanded. The  exchange visits of high-level delegations of the two countries  have contributed to significantly developing this relationship  and strengthening mutual understanding and trust between the two  countries.    In recent years, there have been great and fundamental  changes in the regional and world situations. The most  outstanding feature is that nations wish to attain peace,  stability, and security in order to develop further. The trend  of regional cooperation is vigorously developing.    We highly appraise the Philippine Government's efforts to  support Vietnam becoming an ASEAN observer, to encourage it to  participate in the regional cooperation mechanism, and to invite  it to join ASEAN at an appropriate time. I am firmly convinced  that the visit to Vietnam by the Philippine president will be  crowned with success, thus opening up a new chapter in the  relations of friendship and cooperation between our two nations  for the interests of the two peoples and for peace, stability,  cooperation, and prosperity in Southeast Asia and the world.    President Le Duc Anh proposed a toast for the development of  the relations of friendship and multifaceted cooperation between  Vietnam and the Philippines, for the happiness and prosperity of  the Vietnamese and Philippine peoples, for peace and progress in  Southeast Asia, and for the good health of the Philippine  President and the distinguished guests.    In the reply speech, President Fidel Ramos sincerely thanked  President Le Duc Anh for his kind words and hospitality extended  to the Philippine delegation.    President Fidel Ramos stressed that this is the first visit  by a Philippine President to Vietnam. As a result, the visit is  a significant event in the history of the two nations. He said:  The purpose of my visit is to restore our relations, which were  interposed by history. The president further said: The  foundation of friendship between the two nations has been  strengthened since the establishment of diplomatic relations  after the reunification of Vietnam. Our relations were further  consolidated when we reached agreements in 1978 and 1992 to  respect each other's national dependence, sovereignty, and  territorial integrity.    After asserting the Philippines' commitment to these  agreements, President Fidel Ramos stressed: Manila was proud to  host a forum two years ago at which Vietnam gained access to the  Southeast Asia Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation and became  an observer to ASEAN. On that occasion ASEAN approved the  Manila Declaration on the Eastern Sea and Vietnam promptly  welcomed the declaration. The Philippine president contends  that the sooner Vietnam joins ASEAN the better for ASEAN and  Southeast Asia.    Dealing with the conflict in the Eastern Sea, the Philippine  President said: We should not focus on suspicion among countries  in the region but should concentrate on promoting cooperation to  achieve mutual trust among countries concerned.    After reviewing the similarities between the two countries  and their common wish to expand bilateral relations in the  economic, cultural, social, investment, and tourism domains, the  Philippine President recalled that, in a famous message to the  Philippine people, President Ho Chi Minh wrote: Only when the  root is firm can the tree live longer. President Fidel Ramos  expressed the wish to promote and strengthen the relations of  friendship and cooperation between the two countries.    The Philippine President proposed a toast for the happiness  and prosperity of the Vietnamese people, for the development and  long-lasting relations between the Philippines and Vietnam, and  for the good health of President Le Duc Anh.</p>

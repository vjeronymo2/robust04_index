			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / White House sees sharp fall in jobless rate THE BUSH administration yesterday forecast a sharp drop in US unemployment by the end of the year, as economic growth gathers pace. The White House said it had revised its growth forecast for gross domestic product up to 2.7 per cent (fourth quarter over fourth quarter 1991), from a projection of 2.2 per cent in its January budget. Unemployment will fall to 6.9 per cent by the fourth quarter, the White House said in its half-yearly economic report - a steep fall from last month's disappointing 7.8 per cent figure, although still slightly higher than the rate of 6.8 per cent forecast in the budget. The economic report said real growth, as anticipated, had accelerated slightly from virtual stagnation in 1991, and inflation had stayed subdued. 'The downward trend in interest rates over the past year, lightened debt burdens and improved consumer and business confidence have contributed to the revival in activity. Most private sector forecasters predict a moderate, but sustained, expansion,' the report said. In Chicago, Mr Nicholas Brady, Treasury Secretary, admitted that the economy had not bounced back as quickly as the administration wanted. He blamed this on the heavy burden of debt that households and businesses accumulated in the 1980s. But he said there would be 'solid recovery' in the third quarter, and predicted far better growth in 1993 and 1994. The White House's revised forecasts show a budget deficit this year of only Dollars 333.5bn, much lower than its original estimate of Dollars 400bn. But Mr Richard Darman, budget office director, said the decline resulted from Congressional refusal to authorise new funding for the savings and loan bail-out, and would merely push spending into later years. Reuter reports from Toronto: Main Canadian banks yesterday cut their prime lending rates to a 19-year low, easing from 7 to 6.75 per cent.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / People: Fleming scoops up a Rockefeller The Rockefellers may not be as rich as they once were, but the name still has a cachet in financial circles. Hence the appointment of David Rockefeller, head of the fourth generation of the family, as a non-executive director of Fleming Overseas Investment Trust, is quite a coup for London merchant bankers Robert Fleming. Lord Mark Fitzalan Howard, the Fleming director in charge of the group's investment trust operations, says that his bank has been associated with the Rockefeller family for many years. The two parties used to have a joint venture which invested in unquoted securities and Rockefeller Financial Services, which looks after the family's extensive business and philanthropic interests, has an office in Fleming's headquarters. Despite his name, David Rockefeller, 51, is a relatively recent convert to big business. After studying economics at Cambridge University and law at Harvard, he worked as assistant manager of the Boston Symphony Orchestra for five years before becoming executive vice-president of The Real Paper, a liberal weekly based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During his newspaper sojourn he also moonlighted as a singer with The Boston Camerate. However, after a short spell as an adjunct professor at Columbia University's School of Arts in New York he joined the family firm as a consultant in 1982. Ten years later, he was elected chairman of Rockefeller Financial services succeeding his father, once chairman of Chase Manhattan Bank. The Rockefeller family fortune, estimated by Forbes magazine at Dollars 5.5bn, is shared out among the near 100 members of the family of John D Rockefeller, founder of Standard Oil and the world's first billionaire.</p>

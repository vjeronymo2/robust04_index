			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule change consists of a technical amendment to the clearing fund formula to clearly delineate the clearing fund requirements of NSCC's regular clearing members (``clearing members'') and NCCC's members that only use the mutual fund services (``mutual fund services members''). All NSCC members that use the mutual fund services are required to make clearing fund deposits relating to their mutual fund services usage. For clearing members, this requirement is in addition to their normal clearing fund requirements. Previously, clearing members' clearing fund requirements for usage of mutual fund services was set forth in NSCC Procedure XV, A. I.(a)(iii). However, in the recently approved File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;11, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  NSCC moved this clearing fund requirement to Procedure XV, A.I.(b). Because section A.I.(b) is entitled ``Clearing Fund Formula for Mutual Fund Services Members,'' it is not clear that this requirement applies to both clearing members and members that only use the mutual fund services members even though the mutual fund services clearing formula refers to ``Members'' (i.e., clearing members) and even though NSCC intended that clearing members remain subject to the mutual fund services clearing fund requirement. Accordingly, the proposed rule change is reinserting into section A.I.(a), ``Clearing Fund Formula for Members,'' the mutual fund services component of the clearing fund formula for the purposes of clarity and is limiting section A.I.(b) to mutual fund services members. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33525 (January 26, 1994), 59 FR 04959, [File No. SR&hyph;NSCC&hyph;93&hyph;11] (order approving a proposed rule change relating to capital and clearing fund requirements for users of mutual fund services). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

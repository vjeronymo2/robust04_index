			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEWS;  </P> <P> TOYON QUINTET OPENS CHAMBER MUSIC SEASON AT UC IRVINE WITH SOME COLOR  </P> <P> The Toyon Woodwind Quintet opened the third season of the UC Irvine Chamber  Music series Sunday night. While the program of 19th- and 20th-Century French  compositions did not tax audience intellects, it did at least tickle fancies at  the Fine Arts Concert Hall.  </P> <P> The jaunty red bow ties with matching cummerbunds sported by Gary Bovyer and  Lawrence Kaplan should have hinted that this was not to be an evening of grave  profundity.  </P> <P> Instead, the recently formed quintet -- Leanne Becknell, oboe (replaced on this  occasion by Leslie Reed); Bovyer, clarinet; Rose Corrigan, bassoon; Carol Bacon  Drake, horn; Kaplan, flute (all except Becknell and Kaplan are UCI faculty  members) -- teased their listeners with good-natured humor -- particularly in  the impish Allegro of Ibert's "Trois pieces breves" and the tongue-twisting  flutter of tripping motives in the Vivace of Taffanel's Quintet.  </P> <P> But the humor was strengthened by focused tone, well-considered balance and  technical ease. And, despite the frivolous nature of some of the selections,  the quintet members did not fail to attend to minute details of phrasing and  dynamic sweep. Moreover, the cotton-candy fluff of Ibert and Taffanel did taste  of enough sugar and fun that one hardly minded the lack of substance.  </P> <P> The remainder of the program sparkled with elegant pastoral indulgence.  Kaplan's flute served Debussy with a shimmeringly round-toned "Syrinx."  Clarinetist Emily Bernstein and bassoonist John Steinmetz joined the quintet  for the poignant folk scenes of d'Indy's "Chansons et danses."  </P> <P> Two solos highlighted this final septet -- Drake's beckoning horn passage and  Reed's searchingly caressing oboe melody. These, coupled with the restraint and  coordination that had characterized earlier offerings, created a movingly  pensive closing.  </P></p>

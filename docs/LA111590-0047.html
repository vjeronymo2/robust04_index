Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio), is the first  congressional delegation to visit China since last year's massacre of  pro-democracy protesters in Beijing. In the 17 months since the crackdown,  which prompted Western economic and political sanctions, there had been just  two visits to China by individual members of Congress.  </P> <P> At a news conference Wednesday, the congressmen said the key purpose of their  trip is to urge Chinese leaders to take steps -- primarily the release of  political prisoners -- that could defuse congressional sentiment critical of  Beijing and thereby ensure the preservation of strong trade ties. Otherwise,  Congress may vote next year to end China's most-favored-nation trade status,  they said.  </P> <P> Suharto's visit, the first by an Indonesian leader since 1964, is important  partly for marking the full resumption of close ties between the two nations  after 23 years of estrangement. Indonesia suspended diplomatic relations with  Beijing in 1967, two years after an attempted Communist coup in Jakarta that  Indonesia alleged was backed by China. The two nations restored ties only last  August, and Suharto's six-day visit is now expected to promote expanded trade.  </P> <P> The flurry of diplomatic activity in Beijing comes just one day after Chinese  Foreign Minister Qian Qichen returned from a high-profile Middle East tour that  included talks in Baghdad with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and in Saudi  Arabia with King Fahd.  </P> <P> China's support for efforts to reverse Iraq's conquest of Kuwait has  contributed to the easing of Beijing's isolation in Western capitals. The  European Community ended most of its sanctions against China last month, while  Japan began taking steps this summer toward restoring normal ties.  </P> <P> The U.S. congressmen visiting Beijing said there is no linkage between China's  stand on Iraq and Sino-U.S. trade issues. But they expressed appreciation for  Beijing's stance in the gulf crisis.  </P></p>

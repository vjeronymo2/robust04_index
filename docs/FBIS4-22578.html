			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Skachko: "No Additional Powers to the </F> President: Rukh Is Ready To Be in Opposition"]    [Text] Parliamentary Deputy Vyacheslav Chornovil, leader of  the national-democratic opposition and the People's Rukh,  corroborated his high popularity rating in the parliamentary  elections that have been held and has already defeated 14 rivals  in his district in the first round, garnering 62.5 percent of  the votes. At a news conference in Kiev on 28 March 1994, he  assessed the first round of elections as a victory for the  national-democratic forces, inasmuch as, in his opinion, a  majority of the candidates from the Ukraine association of  democratic forces, of which Rukh was a member, were either  elected in the first round or proceeded into the second.  Vyacheslav Chornovil believes, as before, that the main  deficiency of the election campaign was the ruinous absence of  unity among democrats, and the main virtue of the elections was  that the voters, despite all the cunning of "the party in power"  and the imperfection of the majority law, were nonetheless able  to find their bearings and cast their votes for the democrats.    Regarding the polls conducted by local organs of authority  in  the Republic of Crimea and Donetsk and Lugansk Oblasts to  clarify the attitude of the population toward bilingualism, dual  citizenship, and tighter integration of Ukraine in the CIS,  Vyacheslav Chornovil declared: "Let them take polls, these polls  do not have any legal force, this is the competence not of  individual oblasts but of the people as a whole." With respect  to the outbreak of pro-Russian separatism in the Crimea,  Chornovil said that it had occurred because the economic  situation on the peninsula is much worse than in neighboring  Kuban or Rostov Oblast of the Russian Federation, and he  expressed the proposition that "if the situation were better in  Ukraine, perhaps we would be dealing with Kuban separatism, and,  without interfering in the internal affairs of Russia, we would  also support it." In general, Vyacheslav Chornovil acknowledged  that the elections that were held were democratic, although the  "number of violations exceeded the average permissible level in  such cases in other countries.    Nevertheless, the news conference became not so much a  summing up of the campaign as a definition of Rukh's plans for  the future. Concerning the new Ukrainian Supreme Council,  Chornovil said: "There should be a clear-cut structure in  parliament, not an assemblage of independent deputies." But if a  parliament is not elected, then, in the opinion of the leader of  Rukh, the tactic of his organization will be that he will agree  to the existence of the present Supreme Council, which "should  not grant the president of Ukraine additional powers."  Vyacheslav Chornovil declared that in this case the current  parliament should adopt the so-called little constitution of  Ukraine, that is, new laws on the presidency in Ukraine, and on  local organs of authority and self-government; it should also  change the majority election law to a proportional or mixed one.  But the present law on elections, Chornovil thinks, is  advantageous to Leonid Kravchuk, since it blocked the path to  parliament for many political parties. Vyacheslav Chornovil let  it be known that, as previously, Rukh remains in opposition to  Leonid Kravchuk, but it is not insisting on presidential  elections, inasmuch as "it is ridiculous to elect a president  without knowing what he will be: the head of the executive  authority, or the head of state who only receives ambassadors  and meets with students graduating from school." Therefore,  Chornovil declared that the reaction of Rukh in the presidential  elections will be "calm" until such time as the president's  powers are defined.    As regards strengthening the positions of the extreme  national-radicals, Vyacheslav Chornovil said that some of their  patriotic statements impress him; however, in the main their  actions do not please him, since it is "always important to know  who is leading them, when they zealously fight against both the  communists and against, in their opinion, the rotten democrats."  The Rukh leader asserted also that the second phase of the Rukh  congress will be held on 15-16 April of this year; it will sum  up the election campaign, transform Rukh into a more structured  political party, and finally determine the strategy and tactics  in the elections for president and to local organs of authority.    Afterwards, Vyacheslav Chornovil answered several questions  from NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondents.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Do you not think that the polarization  of Ukraine into eastern and western Ukraine will intensify after  these elections?    [Chornovil] I do not think so, when I look at the lists of  candidates that we have. Perhaps even the center of Ukraine is  in some ways obviously getting closer to western Ukraine. This  is a very interesting aspect. I am very troubled only by  southeast Ukraine. Not the northeast and not the south, but  specifically the Donbass, where the communists have won.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Is Rukh prepared at least 95 percent  to  switch to opposition to the existing authority in Ukraine?    [Chornovil] It is ready, but we still do not know what this  authority will be. But if we form our own authority? Or if we  are able to create a coalition? Why not go for a coalition for  the sake of preserving the state, if there are normal forces for  this? We only will not go for a coalition with the communists.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Can you name your probable allies?    [Chornovil] On economic questions we will form an alliance  with forces from the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, with  its demands for partial centralization of the economy, and with  the Labor Congress of Ukraine, with its social orientation of  reforms. All of them have some form of reformism. The spectrum  will be narrower on political questions: We will support an  alliance only with other national-democratic forces. We are not  as rigid as they, and we are for a unitary Ukraine, but also  against all political autonomies, bilingualism, and other  similar slogans with which some leaders of the "left" of center  are toying.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] But what do you think of the rumors  that are appearing that in this complicated political situation  Rukh once again could go for definite support of the president,  and even for an alliance with him as a bearer of executive  authority and a potential reformer?    [Chornovil] Concerning cooperation with presidential  structures, we approached the president only with a demand to  replace some of his representatives in the localities who are  violating the law. We never raised any questions about  presidential representatives that Leonid Kravchuk pushed in  everywhere who were even a little different from the purely  Communist Party nomenklatura. I do not understand why such close  cooperation with the president and his structures is being  attributed to us.    [NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA] Possibly this is occurring because of  the error of the Rukh thesis about electoral opposition to  Leonid Kravchuk?    [Chornovil] I do not entirely agree with this. But then why  not? Why can an opposition not be constructive? You will recall  how at the beginning of 1992 Leonid Kravchuk suddenly spoke  sharply against the CIS charter, and we supported him at that  time, but within a month we once again began to criticize him  for inconsistency. But also within a month we declared that  Leonid Kravchuk, after discarding the CIS charter as a document,  was putting elements of this charter into practice. This is the  tactic of Rukh's political struggle.</p>

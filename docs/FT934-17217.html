			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading SOME SELLING was seen in London derivatives markets yesterday, but traders believed this to be little more than the expected reaction to the close of third quarter trading in equities, writes Terry Byland. Some shares have benefited from window-dressing support this week and yesterday afternoon saw such deals coming to a close. 'The stock index futures took the end of the quarter worse than the underlying stocks,' commented one leading futures trader. The December contract on the FT-SE 100 held on to a 30-point premium at first, although volume was thin. When Wall Street opened lower, sellers appeared and drove the December contract downwards, bringing equity prices back from their highs in its wake. By the close, the premium against cash had been cut to only 15 points, putting the contract at a discount to its 24-point fair value premium. However, volume was down to 8,152 contracts, the lowest daily figure this week. Traded options business stayed around recent levels, recording 28,864 lots for the day. The FT-SE option, with 8,978 contracts, was a shade quieter than on Wednesday. British Steel (2,309) headed the list of individual stock options, with the Euro FT-SE option (2,256) close behind. Active support for bank shares rubbed off in traded options, where Barclays saw 1,760 contracts dealt.</p>

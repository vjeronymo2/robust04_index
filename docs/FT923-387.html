			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: France's unemployment falls 1 percent THE NUMBER of unemployed in France fell by 1 per cent to 2.88m between July and August, the biggest monthly drop for four years, the Labour Ministry reported yesterday, writes William Dawkins. This reduces the jobless rate by 0.1 of a percentage point to 10.2 per cent at the end of last month. It is also a morsel of good news for public spending, just before the government publishes its 1993 budget, due tommorrow, in which it will unveil a small reduction in income tax.</p>

			<p>940309 FT  09 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Peace talks obstacles trip up the bulls' stampede - Tel Aviv's change in fortunes After a bullish run of several months, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has entered a period of pessimism and caution as the market goes through a crucial period of adjustment driven by political and economic uncertainty. Since the boom of early January the TASE has been through a mini-crash with a 12.5 per cent decline on the Mishtanim two-sided index of the 100 most actively traded blue chip companies. The more speculative Karam index of the smaller capitalised companies has fallen about 27 per cent. From a high of almost 259 points in mid-January, buoyed by over-optimism about the peace process, the Mishtanim index closed yesterday at 221.11, a fall of 0.6. Analysts predict that the market will take several months to recover. Driving this decline of the market are four major factors: fear of further increases in interest rates; a general feeling that the market was overbought and making the shares, particularly on the Karam index, seriously overvalued; the exposure of some of the worst insider trading and share price manipulation since the 1983 bank shares scandal; and the political uncertainty surrounding the peace process and the stability of the fragile coalition government. 'The market was long overdue for a correction,' said Mr David Rosenberg, a market analyst at Pacific Mediterranean Investments. 'But unfortunately several things came at once.' The conditions for a decline in the market were set last December when the central bank, concerned about meeting an inflation target of 8 per cent for 1994, lifted interest rates to 11.5 per cent as inflation reached 11.2 per cent. Although the market did not respond immediately, fear of further rate increases has haunted investors. Those fears will have been boosted yesterday following the publication of an International Monetary Fund report warning of the possibility of further rises in interest rates to combat inflation. However, the real decline in the market started in February as big institutional investors announced that many shares were overvalued, the relation between financial results of companies and their market value was disproportionate, and the market was overbought. The movement of many large investors away from small Karam stocks towards larger capitalised Mishtanim stocks coincided with the revelation of an investigation by the Securities Authority of share price manipulation by brokers and fund managers and the subsequent arrest of three portfolio managers and the investigation of at least a further six. The impact of both these developments was felt most heavily on the Karam index, where shares were most overvalued and also more easily subject to manipulation. Also, the peace euphoria which characterised trading throughout the August-January period finally ran out as talks with the PLO became bogged down. The massacre of Palestinians by a Jewish fanatic in Hebron two weeks ago, followed by the suspension of PLO-Israeli talks, delivered a final crushing blow to investor confidence. 'This is a peace market,' said Mr Goldberg. 'Everything hinges on that. The future economic development of Israel is contingent on the peace process and the market closely reflects that.' Although recent new issues just about mustered a subscription, poor conditions on the market have led the government to postpone for five weeks the sale of Shikun U'Pituach, a state-owned property development company valued at Shk1bn, until later this month. However, many analysts believe the market has swung too low and that the recent decline is only temporary and should be put in the context of the fact that the Mishtanim index has climbed 785 per cent in the past five years, having weathered four major falls but then quickly recovered.</p>

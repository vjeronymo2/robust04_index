			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Bonds: VW's DM500m issue likely to attract investors on Continent Volkswagen, the German car manufacturer, provided the highlight of the international bond market yesterday with the launch of a DM500m five-year Eurobond. The issue from Volkswagen International Finance, which has an A1/AA- credit rating, is expected to attract interest from continental European investors, particularly in the retail sector where Volkswagen is a household name. However, some market participants were surprised by the choice of book-runner, CSFB, which succeeded in getting in ahead of the two German joint leads - Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. It is unusual for a non-German house to act as book-runner in a deal for a German borrower, and there was a fair amount of speculation in the market that CSFB had won the mandate on the grounds of aggressive pricing. The bonds, which have a 5 3/8 per cent coupon, were priced to yield 32 basis points over the 5 per cent government bond due 1999. The deal will break syndicate today. The other main feature of the Eurobond market yesterday was the burst of activity in the Swiss franc sector, where borrowers launched a flood of mainly equity-linked deals. With Swiss franc interest rates at their current low levels, specialists in the sector point out that the only way to stimulate any investor interest is with the addition of an equity kicker, either using a convertible bond structure or by attaching warrants. Among the other deals of the day, the Republic of Portugal's Ecu750m, 10-year issue was priced to yield 28 basis points over the 6 per cent Ecu OAT due 2004. Morgan Stanley, one of the joint lead managers, said the bonds were still trading at the issue price of 98.325 by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the People's Republic of China is expected to launch its long-awaited Dollars 1bn bond issue shortly, dealers said. The Philippine central bank imposed limits on the amount that public and private institutions will be allowed to raise in the international bond market to prevent a recurrence of the debt crisis of the 1980s, Reuter reports from Manila. Mr Gabriel Singson, central bank governor, said the 1994 limit would be Dollars 2.5bn for long-term bond issues and Dollars 300m for short-term issues. To keep within the target, Mr Singson said President Fidel Ramos had ordered state agencies and corporations to have their borrowing plans approved by the central bank before issuing bonds. Moody's Investors Service, the credit rating agency, has raised the subordinated debt rating of HSBC Holdings to A3 from Baa1. The rating for long-term deposits for Midland Bank, the UK banking subsidiary of HSBC Holdings, was also raised, to Aa3 from A1.</p>

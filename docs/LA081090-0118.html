			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HEARING ON P.V. SCHOOL CLOSURES REPORT  </P> <P> The Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School District will hold a public hearing  Monday to discuss a draft environmental impact report on school closures  districtwide.  </P> <P> The hearing was requested by the consultant hired by a parents group that  challenged the school board's 1987 decision to close Miraleste High School  because of declining enrollment.  </P> <P> The board later rescinded its action.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles Superior Court judge ordered the district to prepare the report  after the parents group filed suit to keep Miraleste open.  </P> <P> Monday's hearing will begin at 7:30 p.m. at district headquarters. Additional  hearings in September at the Rolling Hills High School gymnasium will focus on  a completed version of the report.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council voted to send a letter to the  school district criticizing the draft report. City officials say the draft does  not adequately address transportation and economic issues.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Finnish News Service report based on Stockholm TIDNINGARNAS </F> TELEGRAMBURO dispatch: "Rwanda Is a Catastrophe Also for AIDS  Research"]    [Text] The war in Rwanda has destroyed a large-scale  medical project for testing the AIDS vaccine. Laboratories,  research personnel -- everything that was in place, says  Professor Lars Olaf Kallings to TIDNINGARNAS TELEGRAMBURO.    Now the Belgian, French, and U.S. physicians, as well as  other experts who were responsible for the project, have  departed the area. Rwandans who were involved find themselves in  flight either inside or outside the country.    Rwanda has been hard hit by AIDS. A study conducted two  years  ago found that 45 percent of pregnant women in the country were  infected with HIV.  <H5>  Rwanda at the AIDS Catastrophe's Epicenter </H5>   "Rwanda, Burundi, and the Kagera area in Tanzania, and a  part  of Zaire comprise the epicenter of the African AIDS  catastrophe," says Prof. Kallings, who is part of the  international effort, but is on the the staff of the Swedish  Public Health Institute in Stockholm.    The UN World Health Organization (WHO) had selected Brazil,  Uganda, Thailand, and Rwanda for the vaccine project. The  research station and laboratory located in Kigali, the capital,  had already produced good results before the appearance of any  vaccine that could be tested on a large scale.    "What we know about how the infection is spread from mother  to child, and especially about the role of breast milk, has  often come from studies in Rwanda, just as understanding of how  a noninfected partner in a marriage can be protected," says  Kallings.    He emphasizes that WHO's Rwanda project was not tainted by  colonialism. It did not operate by having foreign exports come  to an underveloped country in order to demonstrate how things  were to be done. The Rwandan authorities and Rwandan staff  personnel played a large role, he stated.    "It is tragic that this is now all destroyed. Moreover,  Rwanda is a country that in general has great need of the  results from the vaccine project," he says.  <H5>  Enormous Streams of Refugees </H5>   "We don't know how the institutions that were responsible  for  the project have been impacted by the war. But we can fear the  worst."    In Kinshasa, located in neighboring Zaire, is found a good  AIDS laboratory with significance for the entire region. Riots a  couple of years ago led to plundering of the building. The  refrigerator was lifted out and all tests destroyed, states  Kallings, and he now fears the same sort of thing is now  happening in Kigali.    Enormous waves of refugees have fled from Rwanda over the  past month, especially into Tanzania.    "We know that war and fleeing of people leads to spreading  the infection," asserts Prof. Kallings.</p>

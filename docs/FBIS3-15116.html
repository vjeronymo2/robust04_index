The issue  of the origin of funds that enabled Mr. Zhirinovskiy's to  address his fellow countrymen so often has been discussed at all  levels by all persons concerned. New information, however,  forces a different approach to the question of the LDPR's  hypothetical financial power. Apparently at least part of the  LDPR's campaign was financed by counterfeit payment orders  issued on behalf of organizations which were not going to  contest the elections.    On 6 December the LDPR sent payment order 28 for 26 million  rubles through Progressbank to the Galaktika radio station,  which is the prime contractor of the Ostankino TV and radio  company's Publitsist studio, in payment for "LDPR's election  campaign transmissions in the Novaya Volna program from 1  December to 12 December 1993." According to Vladimir Lugovinov,  general director of the Publitsist studio, the "payment order"  was to cover expenses of three hours of air time made available  to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy to conduct his election campaign.    At the same time, a letter came to the Mayak radio station  accounts department signed by Vladimir Zhirinovskiy asking to  make air time available; somewhat later, payment order 78/93,  for 10,719,737 rubles as of 6 December, came from Progressbank.  The LPDR leader received 69 minutes of air time.    In spite of the "payment orders," no money came to the radio  companies' accounts. Their representatives asked Progressbank  to explain the delay in the money transfer. On 24 January V.G.  Znayko, chairman of Progressbank's governing board, said that  payment orders 28 of 1 December 1993 and 78/93 of the same date  were not found among the bank's documents. Radio company  representatives tried to contact the LDPR's member who conducted  talks on allocating air time available to Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.  No coherent answer was received. The victim organizations  intend to go to court.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London robusta COFFEE prices ended mixed. Dealers attributed the lack of business partly to unwillingness to trade during the ICO talks which were due to end late yesterday. 'I think it's generally quiet but just in case any miracle did happen (at the talks), people weren't going to do a great deal,' one said. New York arabicas had recovered some of Tuesday's losses in late trading. On the LME the premium for cash ZINC over three-month metal widened to Dollars 12.50 a tonne as the market recovered some of this week's losses. COPPER prices remained easier this afternoon although the market consolidated above the three-month lows of Dollars 2,344 a tonne for three-month metal set earlier. Support is expected around Dollars 2,340 but the market appears to have limited upside potential. Comex copper prices were in retreat at midday. One trader pointed out that Comex stocks are at a five-year high of 51,025 short tons (2,000 lbs) and LME stocks are at the highest level since April. NICKEL continued to ease, with the market unable to build on earlier gains. However, there was underlying support from uncertainty over producer intentions. Compiled from Reuters</p>

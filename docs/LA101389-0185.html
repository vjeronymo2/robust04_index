			<p><P> October 13, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> AMR SILENT ON TRUMP BUYOUT BID  </P> <P> AMR Corp. remained silent today on a $7-billion proposed buyout by New York  developer Donald Trump amid reports the parent of American Airlines is seeking  help from unions and billionaire Robert M. Bass.  </P> <P> In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR was up $3.625 a  share to $102.375, still well below the $120 per share offered by Trump, but it  was the second straight day of an increase. On Thursday, AMR rose $1.625 to  close at $98.75 as 1.6 million shares changed hands.  </P> <P> Financial analysts have said the stock will continue to trade far below the  level of Trump's offer until there is a significant move by either side.  </P> <P> The New York Times reported today that AMR Chairman Robert L. Crandall met with  American's pilots union about a possible employee-management buyout designed to  fend off Trump's offer. The buyout would include significant participation by  the pilots union and the unions representing machinists and flight attendants  at American, the paper said.  </P></p>

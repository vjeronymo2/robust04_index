			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAWAIIAN AIR DEAL SHOWS RISKS OF SPECULATION;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> Hawaiian Airlines, often a bridesmaid but never a bride, seemed to be a good  stock for speculation.  </P> <P> The majority owner was elderly and eager to sell. The airline was positioned in  the center of the lucrative Pacific Rim, the fastest-growing market in a highly  competitive industry. And at least three suitors had wooed the firm in the past  two years.  </P> <P> Although the airline's parent firm, HAL Inc. of Honolulu, was losing money, it  was still able to reach a deal in January to sell the company for $45 a share.  The deal fell through, but shareholders kept betting that another suitor would  emerge.  </P> <P> One did. On Sunday, directors of HAL agreed to sell the company to a group  headed by former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth and Newport Beach  developer J. Thomas Talbot. The price: $22 a share, or $9.625 below its closing  price of $31.625 last Friday.  </P> <P> The deal is an example of the risks of playing in takeover stocks, especially  ones not widely traded.  </P> <P> HAL's stock closed Tuesday at $23.625 in trading on the American Stock  Exchange, down $1.625 on the day.  </P> <P> The transaction appears to be a "done deal." The majority owner, John H. Magoon  Jr., said Tuesday that he has agreed to sell a 51% stake -- a controlling block  -- to the Ueberroth-Talbot team.  </P> <P> But 1,900 shareholders own the rest of the stock. How, they may wonder, could a  third of the company's value seemingly evaporate overnight?  </P> <P> It's easy, say industry analysts, when shares are lightly traded, a single  stockholder owns a majority interest and brokerage houses don't bother  researching the small company.  </P> <P> Even Magoon, who will remain as chairman, seemed amazed that the stock was  selling so high, even though he had paid $35 a share to buy out the company  president's 3% stake a few months ago.  </P> <P> "People were speculating that somebody was going to come in and buy at a higher  price. They were gambling," said Magoon, 73. "It seemed to me the stock was  somewhat overpriced."  </P> <P> Magoon said he is satisfied with $22 a share -- especially since the company  has lost $30.6 million in the last 2 1/2 years and its liabilities exceeded its  assets by $8.5 million at the end of June.  </P> <P> Analysts critical of Magoon's management said the losses are expected to  continue.  </P> <P> HAL INC. STOCK PRICE  </P> <P> Tuesday close: $23.625, down $1.625  </P> <P> Los Angeles Times  </P></p>

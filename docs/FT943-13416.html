			<p>940720 FT  20 JUL 94 / Bosnian Serbs silent on vote Bosnian Serb leaders yesterday ended two days of heated debate, refusing to reveal their decision on a 'last chance' international peace plan. But they reportedly voted for conditional acceptance, an answer previously dismissed as unacceptable by the plan's architects: the US, Russia, Germany, France and Britain. The conditions are to be submitted to the western 'contact group' in Geneva today, and are believed to include constitutional guarantees allowing the self-proclaimed Serb state to join Serbia instead of remaining in the planned Bosnian union with the Moslem-Croat federation. They also sought revision of the 'take it or leave it' maps to include the division of Sarajevo and access to the Adriatic sea. The contact group had set a Tuesday deadline for the warring parties to give either a clear Yes or No. Bosnia's Moslems have indicated they will accept the plan.</p>

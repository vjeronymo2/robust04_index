			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Togo opposition wins election Opponents of Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema won a majority in parliamentary elections, limiting presidential power and obliging Mr Eyadema to appoint a prime minister from the ranks of his rivals, Reuter reports from Lome. Results of last month's polls, announced yesterday by Togo's Supreme Court, gave Mr Eyadema's Togolese People's Assembly and its allies 38 of parliament's 81 seats, while the rival Action Committee for Renewal and Togolese Union for Democracy won 43 seats between them.</p>

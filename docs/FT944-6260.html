			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Fund for deprived areas to expand - Inner cities Finance for the single regeneration budget, which targets spending on deprived areas, is to be increased to a total of Pounds 800m over the next three years. The budget, introduced in April, brought resources from 20 regeneration programmes run by five Whitehall departments into a combined, regionally administered fund. It gives priority to projects in which a range of partners work together. The government will make an additional Pounds 75m over three years available for schemes that took part in the first round of bidding for support from the budget. This means Pounds 125m will be available for new projects in 1995-96 and 1996-97, rising to Pounds 225m in 1997-98. More than 450 bids have been submitted and the winners will be announced shortly. Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, yesterday said that the success of the first round had prompted him to launch a second next year. This would make more than Pounds 800m available for new single regeneration budget projects over the next three years. 'The first round bids indicate that on average for every Pounds 1 spent through the single regeneration budget, a further Pounds 4 will be levered in from other private and public contributors,' he said. This would generate a total of more than Pounds 5bn for new regeneration work, and have a 'huge impact on many of our most run-down areas'. By bringing the activities of all departments involved in inner-city issues together, the new budget is widely regarded as a improvement on the previous piecemeal approach. Community organisations are, however, concerned about the budget's adequacy and about projects previously funded by the government that will fall outside its remit.</p>

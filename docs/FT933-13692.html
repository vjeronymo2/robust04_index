			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: UK television The fiasco over the scheduling of News at Ten highlights in technicolour the unwieldy operation of the ITV network. If the ITV system did not exist, nobody would bother to invent it. Splitting one television channel among 15 companies is manifestly wasteful and prevents more resources being devoted to programme-making. Some industry rationalisation may occur next year when the moratorium preventing hostile takeovers of the smaller companies ends. But given the inertia of government, Mr Peter Brooke seems unlikely to lift the restraints on any of the big nine companies buying each other. The only spur to change might be if a foreign company bid for a station and aroused jingoistic passions. It is bizarre to regulate any industry in such a way, especially when a clear distinction can easily be drawn between the ownership of a TV station and its regional character. Some big bets are now being placed on this nonsense ending. Granada's Pounds 90m acquisition of a 20 per cent stake in LWT is the boldest move. The carrying cost of this investment will be about Pounds 4m a year. But the prize will be great if the rules are changed and Granada can win LWT and merge its operations. Yet in a truly open market, LWT would be worth more to its neighbour, Carlton, which could be expected to win any bidding war. In that case, Granada may effectively exchange its LWT holding for LWT's own interest in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, creating a strong northern operation. As for Carlton, it may fall back on buying Central, in which it holds a 20 per cent stake, if, as seems likely, the MMC blocked a bid for LWT. The large companies seem more inclined to wait for the bigger catches to wriggle free than to chase the smaller fry. This makes the surging share prices of the tiddlers rather hard to justify.</p>

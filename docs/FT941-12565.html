			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Punishment and prevention: Will President Clinton be able to do anything to combat crime in the US? On Wednesday a teenager stood in front of Eliot Junior High School, north-east Washington, and fired eight shots at a student who had failed to return a borrowed coat. Mr Franklin Smith, superintendent of Washington DC schools, was not surprised. Teenagers, he said, 'will shoot each other about anything, about stepping on a toe'. Such episodes help explain why President Bill Clinton put a crackdown on crime at the top of his list of priorities in this week's State of the Union address. He echoed governors of every political stripe, from Democrat Mr Mario Cuomo in New York to Republican Mr Pete Wilson in California, in lamenting a fear of violent crime that is 'crippling our society, limiting personal freedom and fraying the ties that bind us'. Opinion polls show the number of people citing crime and violence as the most serious issue facing the US has risen over the past year from about 2 per cent to 20 per cent or more, displacing the economy and unemployment as the most pressing concern. Anxiety about mounting violence may rest more on perception than on reality, however. Justice Department surveys indicate that the number of people who have been victims of violent crime in any given year has stayed flat for the last two decades at between 29 and 34 per 1,000. Nevertheless, the level of violent attacks on specific groups, such as teenagers and black Americans, has risen sharply in recent years. And overall rates of violent crime, although static, are exceptionally high in comparison with most other developed countries: the US homicide rate is seven times that of Canada, 20 times Germany's. Levels of fear are heightened by incidents cited by Mr Clinton in his speech: the abduction and subsequent murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas from her bedroom in northern California; the racially motivated outburst that left six people dead and 17 injured on a Long Island commuter train; the attempted murder of a black tourist in Florida by three whites who poured petrol over him and set him on fire. Perhaps most frightening are the shootings by ever younger and more heavily armed gang members in inner cities. Such attacks create a feeling that violence has spilled over to invade traditional sanctuaries such as the family home or school. It feels, as Professor Lawrence Friedman of Stanford University puts it in his recent book Crime and Punishment in American History, 'like some tremendous boxing match where the boxers, instead of pounding each other inside the ring, suddenly jump through the ropes and begin mauling and maiming the screaming audience'. Crime is not a new issue in the political arena, but significant government action has for years been immobilised by a polarisation between advocates of repression and prevention; between those who want to build more prisons and inflict tougher sentences and those who want to tackle crime's roots with drug treatment and rehabilitation and inner-city job schemes. 'The left wants prevention and no punishment. The right wants punishment and no prevention,' said Democrat Congressman Charles Schumer, chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee on crime. Efforts to extend controls on guns have also - at least until recently  - been immobilised. But in this area, for reasons rooted in the US's history, constitution and political traditions, opposition to tougher measures has come from the right. The left has found calls for gun control a demonstration of its seriousness about tackling crime. What is new in Mr Clinton's approach, at least for Washington, is the willingness to take all three medicines - prevention, repression and gun control - at once. In his address on Tuesday he endorsed not only the 'three strikes and you're out' initiative - a measure, backed by the Senate but not the House of Representatives, to require a mandatory life sentence for a third violent offence - but also community policing, an expanded police force, army-style 'boot camps' for young offenders, a ban on assault weapons and more money for drug treatment, as well as job training and urban development measures. As is traditional, Congress is also likely to extend the death penalty to 20 or 30 more offences. It will be a futile gesture, since violent crime and its punishment are overwhelmingly dealt with by the states, not the federal government: the last extension included esoteric federal crimes such as murdering a federal egg inspector. It will not be easy to maintain a coalition to pass all these measures in Congress. The Senate has already passed a ban on assault weapons, but resistance from the gun lobby to this measure will remain strong. At the same time, many of the more leftwing members of the House - especially some leading black representatives, whose experience in the 1960s civil rights protests and since has given them reason to distrust the police  -are hostile to what they see as egregious encroachments on civil liberties passed by the Senate, including stiffer penalties for gang members, looser standards of evidence, and draconian restrictions on parole. But while the marriage of repression and prevention in President Clinton's proposals may feel unnatural to many national politicians, it has already taken place in public opinion and among local law enforcement officers. Gun owners now say increasingly that they want more gun controls, and local officials insist on the importance of urban development in the battle against crime. 'In our view, lasting solutions lie in Washington's willingness to view affordable housing as a weapon to fight crime, to view childcare, job training, recreation programmes, community development and transportation to jobs as weapons to fight crime,' a group of mayors and police chiefs wrote in a letter to Mr Clinton last month. Severe doubts must remain, however, about the capacity of any measures taken by Washington to curb more than marginally the violence that plagues the US  -not the least because criminal justice falls very much under local jurisdiction. By most standards the US criminal justice system is already tough. If putting more people in prison kept criminals out of circulation, then crime should have plummeted, for the prison population has climbed from 196,429 at the end of 1970 to 789,347 at the end of 1991. If capital punishment were the ultimate deterrent, the US should be relatively free of violence, for it applies the death penalty in more and more cases - including the execution of juvenile offenders, a practice followed by only five other countries. Nor is there any magic solution to be found in specific prevention programmes, particularly if they are funded at the austere levels necessitated by the US budget deficit. Many pilot schemes, such as intensive pre-school monitoring of babies at risk from behavioural problems, or handing over government housing to be managed by its residents, have produced good results - but have been less encouraging when turned into nationwide schemes. Mr Clinton's greatest strength in tackling crime is his willingness to address the problem in the context of 'a stunning and simultaneous breakdown of community, family and work'. While there are no concrete or swift solutions to be found in a moral crusade, Mr Clinton may be able to provide leadership in this area. That in itself cannot be turned into programmes to fit into a crime bill; as long as voters remain frightened of violence, Washington will continue the search for measures that can.</p>

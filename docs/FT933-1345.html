			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Leading Article: Times a-changing BRITISH time is out of joint with the rest of Europe. That the UK spends most of the year lagging an hour behind the rest of Europe is an unnecessary disruption to the life of British business and commerce. That summer-time ends a month later in Britain than on the continent, where the clocks fall back this weekend, only adds to the confusion. It's time for a change, as Mr Michael Howard has acknowledged. The home secretary wants Britain to move to what his ministry calls 'single double summer-time', code for continental European time. Winter-time would then arrive one hour ahead of Greenwich mean time, and summer-time two hours ahead. Conservative defenders of GMT are up in arms. But it is northern Scots who deserve sympathy. Daylight in the Scottish isles would then arrive well after nine o'clock in winter, although their short evenings would be longer. Euro-sceptics are likely to cause more serious problems for the government. It will rely on evidence that lighter evenings mean fewer traffic accidents. But subsidiarity allows governments to choose common European standards if they wish. A pan-European time-zone is in Britain's interests. Mr Howard should say so.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vyacheslav Bantin] </F>   [Text] Tokyo June 21 TASS -- Russia's Democratic Choice  (RDC) party believes that the territorial problem in relations  with Japan "is a long-term task which has no easy solutions",  RDC chairman Yegor Gaydar told ITAR-TASS. He arrived in Tokyo  on Monday for a private visit to discuss ways of cooperation  between the RDC and Japan's largest opposition  Liberal-Democratic Party (LDP) and attend an international  seminar on investment problems. He was due to meet with members  of the LDP and Japanese Foreign Ministry leadership on Tuesday.    "While recognising the existence of a territorial problem,  we  consider that any approaches to its solution should be based on  the results of the Russo-Japanese summit talks in Tokyo in  autumn last year," Gaydar pointed out. He expressed an opinion  that the problem could be resolved only when public consensus  develops in Russia and Japan on how that could be done.    Touching upon the RDC's foreign contacts, Gaydar said the  party intends to conclude cooperation agreements with a number  of foreign parties, similar to that which was concluded with the  Japanese Liberal-Democratic Party last week.    "Strengthening political ties with those political forces  abroad, which are interested in a normal development of Russia,  is an important element of our calm work to overcome xenophobia  in Russia and to counter ideas, which are being spread in the  country by some of our political opponents, about some  conspiracy against Russia and her isolation in the world,"  Gaydar said.    "We attach much importance to developing contacts with Japan  and regard the LPD as one of our serious and long-term  partners," the RDC chairman pointed out.    "The conclusion of an agreement with the LDP is not linked  with hopes to get financial support from it," he said. "We may  not permit ourselves to make use of financial support from  foreign political parties and intend to build our relations with  them on the basis of equal partnership," Gaydar said.    The RDC chairman said "Russia will succeed in maintaining  political stability within at least the next six months despite  the existence of forces which are interested in destabilising  the situation in the country".</p>

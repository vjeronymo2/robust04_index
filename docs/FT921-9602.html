			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Inflation-beating increase contrasts with redundancies: Recommendations of the public-sector pay review bodies - Armed Services 297,000-strong but declining - was at the upper end of expectations after a relatively generous increase last year. It comes as Army personnel await the first wave of redundancies under the government's planned cuts in service strength. 'We were not anticipating anything extraordinary,' an Army officer commented yesterday. The review body, chaired by Sir Peter Cazalet, recommended a general increase of 5.9 per cent, with some categories of warrant officer receiving a higher 7.9 per cent to bring them more into line with comparable civilian jobs. Under the increases the pay of a Royal Navy lieutenant with six years in the rank will rise from Pounds 23,007 to Pounds 24,302. A Lieutenant Colonel or Wing Commander will receive Pounds 36,964, up from Pounds 35,001. The pay levels include the so-called X factor, designed to reflect the special hardships of service life. This now stands at 11.5 per cent of the basic pay, after being increased last year. Pay scales for officers promoted from the ranks are being uprated. Increments for long-serving non-commissioned officers are also to be increased, but the review body questioned the effectiveness of the current system. The recommendations are expected to add Pounds 291.9m to the armed forces' salary bill including the cost of reserves. But higher charges for food and accommodation will recover about Pounds 17.7m of the extra cost. The estimated 5.9 per cent increase in the pay bill for regular forces compares with 12.2 per cent last year when the armed services was the only public-sector group to have the rise paid in full rather than by stages. That increase came in the middle of the Gulf war. In its recommendations, the review body said it had to take account of 'much uncertainty about future roles and jobs' following the announcement last summer of plans to reduce numbers of regular personnel by 62,000. The remuneration package played 'no small part' in servicemen's motivation, it said. A first batch of redundancies, mostly voluntary, is due to be announced later this month involving about 850 army officers and 2,500 soldiers. Review Body on Armed Forces' Pay, HMSO, Pounds 6.25.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / Argentine forces retake riot city Argentine government security forces yesterday retook control of the north-western city of Santiago del Estero, where rioters on Thursday burned down public buildings, ransacked the homes of local politicians and looted shops, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. In the worst rioting Argentina has seen since hyperinflation gripped the country in 1989, about 5,000 public employees took to the streets in protest at unpaid wages and plans to cut government jobs. Nine people were killed.</p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS;  </P> <P> CHAMORRO RULES BUT SANDINISTAS RETAIN POWER;  </P> <P> NICARAGUA: BOTH SIDES WON -- AND LOST -- IN RECENT STRIKES. THE LEFTISTS PROVED  THEY HAVE VETO POWER OVER THE NEW REGIME.  </P> <P> When Daniel Ortega accepted his stunning defeat by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro  in Nicaragua's presidential election last February, he vowed that the  Sandinistas would "govern from below."  </P> <P> Since Chamorro took office April 25, Sandinista unions have twice paralyzed the  country with labor strikes -- proving not that Sandinistas control the  government but certainly that Chamorro's conservative coalition cannot govern  without Sandinista cooperation.  </P> <P> Today, the Sandinistas, who led an armed insurrection against the Somoza family  dictatorship, will mark the 11th anniversary of their revolution. It is their  first celebration as an opposition party, and they are likely to hail the  strikes as their first major opposition victories.  </P> <P> As Nicaragua's biggest, most organized political party, they have consistently  exerted a veto power over the fragile Chamorro government.  </P> <P> A 10-day walkout that ended last week, as well as a six-day civil servants'  strike in May, have kept the government on the defensive, and Chamorro's inner  circle of technocrats seem no match for the politically savvy Sandinistas.  </P> <P> During this month's strike, workers and students barricaded streets and  occupied buildings in Managua, shutting down government ministries, banks, the  airport, state industries and travel across international borders.  </P> <P> The strikers made wage demands, but their primary concern was economic policy.  Sandinista peasants occupied thousands of acres of private and state-owned  farms to protest government plans to rent the public lands and eventually  return them to their pre-revolution owners.  </P> <P> The government declared the strike illegal and refused to negotiate -- but when  faced with chaos, officials backed down. The settlement, while far less than  the Sandinistas had sought, forced the government to rein in its free-market  economic program.  </P> <P> The sale of state-owned lands and the return to private hands of the state  textile industry, construction and other industries were effectively put on  hold. On these and other economic policy decisions, the government agreed to  consult the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> "It is clear that there are two powers here in Nicaragua," Roman Catholic  Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo declared Sunday after denouncing the strike  violence, which left at least four dead and dozens wounded. "The new government  and the Sandinistas -- two powers."  </P> <P> The Sandinistas, however, have paid a price for their rough-and-tumble tactics:  The barricades and burning tires buoyed the most militant party members, but  Nicaraguans weary after more than a decade of a U.S.-backed war with the  Contras are generally fed up with violence. Such confrontations are not likely  to increase popular support for the Sandinistas.  </P> <P> If they are ever to govern again, the Sandinistas must transform their leftist  vanguard movement into an unarmed, social democratic party capable of winning  elections and international support -- and in that respect, the strike was a  step backward.  </P> <P> "The two sides were playing a negative-sum game," central bank President  Francisco Mayorga, one of Chamorro's economic planners, said of the strike. "It  was a war in which the loser is the one who loses the most. But both sides  lose."  </P> <P> Chamorro, 60, remains a popular figure, diplomats and political analysts say,  but her government was badly damaged by the crisis. Not only was the government  unable to maintain public order for several days, but officials were absent  from the public eye. State television installations were occupied by strikers;  Chamorro's newspaper, La Prensa, did not publish, while the Sandinista daily,  Barricada, and the pro-Sandinista Nuevo Diario did.  </P> <P> "The government didn't exist for three days," one European diplomat said.  </P> <P> Into that vacuum stepped ultra-conservative Vice President Virgilio Godoy, who  announced the formation of a National Salvation Committee, challenging  Chamorro's authority and handling of the crisis.  </P> <P> The strike settlement prompted more criticism from the right wing of Chamorro's  coalition, the National Opposition Union (UNO).  </P> <P> Gilberto Cuadra, president of the Superior Council of Private Enterprise  (COSEP), accused Chamorro of making "secret deals" with the Sandinistas and of  abandoning her election commitment to a free-market economy.  </P> <P> "She has left behind her natural bases," Cuadra said in an interview. "She  negotiated when she said she wouldn't. She lost lots of credibility."  </P> <P> Besides underscoring strains between Chamorro on the one side and COSEP and  some right-wing parties in the UNO coalition on the other, the strike also  produced widespread rumors of tensions within her Cabinet. But Mayorga, the  central bank president, denied reports that he was unhappy with the strike  agreement.  </P> <P> "COSEP has a right to pressure for rapid privatization, and I sympathize with  that point of view," he said. "But the government has to accommodate the  process to the national political (situation)."  </P> <P> Despite the agreement, he insisted, sooner or later, the government will go  forward with privatization.  </P> <P> "There is a debate within the government about what is going to be privatized,  when and how. But everything is subject to privatization under the program for  which the people voted. Some things will be returned to their (prior) owners,  some will be sold to workers and others will be sold to private investors," he  said.  </P> <P> Mayorga estimated the strike cost $24 million in lost production, plus damages  to the streets of Managua, where cobblestones were taken up to build  barricades.  </P> <P> Chamorro's government had planned to privatize all state farms except those  that once belonged to the Somoza family and its cronies.  </P> <P> The Sandinistas want the lands and industries to remain in state hands, not  only for ideological reasons but also for self-interest: Along with the army,  the peasant and public-sector unions form their strongest base of support.  </P> <P> Officials of Chamorro's government note that the strike agreement was  negotiated by Ortega, the former president, and other Sandinistas, rather than  by peasant and union leaders. They call the strike political "sabotage" rather  than a labor dispute.  </P> <P> Sandinista officials, however, say they were intermediaries between the  government and their radical base. The party's National Directorate supported  the strike but did not initiate it, they say.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the Sandinistas were trying to capitalize on economic discontent  during the walkout. The new government had raised expectations with promises of  private investment and Mayorga's early claim that he would halt inflation  within 100 days.  </P> <P> Inflation has continued to skyrocket, however. The cordoba, Nicaragua's  national currency, has been devalued from about 70,000 to the dollar in April  to more than 420,000 today. Strike leaders sought a guaranteed minimum wage  pegged to the dollar.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, neither the Sandinistas nor the government expected the violence,  said one political analyst, Xabier Gorostiaga. He said a major concern for the  Sandinista leadership was to prevent a confrontation between the Sandinista-led  army and the unions.  </P> <P> In fact, the armed forces, which received high marks for restraint, may have  won the most from the strike. No soldiers or police were killed, nor did they  kill anyone, diplomats and other officials noted.  </P> <P> "The army played it well," a European diplomat said. "They were smart. You  didn't see them in the street until the moment (Chamorro) called them in. They  were careful to respect what was happening (the strike), but no one could say  they were acting illegally."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> After their revolution in 1979, the Sandinistas confiscated all the holdings of  the ousted Somoza family and the plantations of many other wealthy landowners.  Later, they sometimes confiscated the holdings of their political enemies. They  gave land to about half the peasants in Nicaragua under a national agrarian  reform program, and most were organized into cooperatives covering about 20% of  all farmland. The state kept plantations totaling about 13% of the land, and  these are managed with the participation of Sandinista unions.  </P></p>

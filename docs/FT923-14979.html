			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets: Mexican bolsa loses its international appeal - Foreigners are selling out on concerns about the economy and corporate earnings Mexico's stock market has lost some of its glitter in the past month. The foreigners who pushed the market up and up for two years have taken fright, causing the market to fall 15.5 per cent in June, the sharpest drop since October 1987. While the market has recovered somewhat this week, some analysts warn that it remains vulnerable. Economic growth is sluggish, which is likely to have an impact on second quarter earnings. 'If one of these (large) companies reports bad earnings, I can see the market falling again,' says Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services. The capacity for unpleasant surprises remains since most Mexican companies and analysts do not bother too much about quarterly earnings forecasts, while many American analysts do not understand Mexico's complicated inflation accounting. This room for misunderstanding between the Mexican and US cultures was brought home last month when largely-unfounded rumours over the sale of Telmex stock by the telephone union caused a certain panic in New York, and a sharp drop in Telmex's share price. Before Telmex had time to recover, an attack on its growth prospects and accounting practices by an independent US analyst, Mr David Bodenberg, caused the price to fall once again. 'What you have,' says Mr Terry Mahony, who manages the Baring Puma Fund, 'is completely neophyte investors applying American analytical techniques to Mexico.' Other US investors put it differently. Mr Robert Gay of Banker's Trust says: 'Mexican companies do not recognise the information required of them. Last year's numbers are never the same, and are always being revised.' Foreign investors ploughed into the Mexican market last year and in the first few months of 1992, raising their stake from a modest Dollars 4.25bn at the beginning of 1991 to Dollars 27.2bn at the end of May. They became the dominant force in the bolsa, holding 20 per cent of the market capitalisation, and between one-half and two-thirds of the market float - that is, those shares which are actively traded. Until last month foreigners had been rewarded handsomely, with the market more than doubling in 1991, and up 33 per cent in the first five months of this year. But in June a series of troubling events lead to a rapid sell-off by the more fickle investors. Top on the list of bad news was uncertainty over the US election, caused by the then growing popularity of Mr Ross Perot and the fear that, if elected, he would not support the North American free agreement (Nafta). While brokers are keen to say that Nafta merely makes Mexico even more attractive, the perception among many investors is that the agreement is crucial for the long-term stability of Mexico's economic policy. When Nafta's future came in doubt, many started to sell. Two worrying trends exacerbated the bad news. First, there was the overwhelming amount of stock that Mexican companies were offering on national and international markets. In 1991 Mexican companies offered Dollars 4.8bn of new stock, and to mid-June this year another Dollars 4.3bn. Add to that the figure of roughly Dollars 12bn of bank stock auctioned off by the government, and over Dollars 21bn worth of new Mexican equity has been sold in 18 months. 'That is equal to 6.7 per cent of Mexico's GDP,' says Mr Timothy Heyman of Baring Research in Mexico City. 'In the US it would be like trying to sell off nearly Dollars 400bn of stock in 18 months.' The straw that broke the market's back was the proposed offering of 220m shares in Banacci, comprising Mexico's largest bank, Banamex, which was intended to fetch Dollars 1.5bn. The offering, personally supported by Mexico's finance minister, Mr Pedro Aspe, served little obvious purpose, since Banacci is well-capitalised, and its owners had already paid the government Dollars 3.2bn for 70.7 per cent of the shares in the recently privatised bank without difficulty. At the last minute, the offering had to be abandoned because of the market fall in June. With it, a host of other issues in the pipeline, led by Grupo Simec and Grupo Synkro, were postponed. A further concern is the perceived slowdown in Mexico's economy this year. Mr Gray from Bankers Trust expects Mexican growth to be around 3 per cent this year, and warns that some companies' earnings will be disappointing. As he points out, Mexico has tightened short-term interest rates since April, with rates up by around 5 percentage points. Companies geared to the consumer and construction markets are likely to suffer from the higher rates. Cemex, Mexico's main cement producer, reckons that volume will increase by 9 per cent in the second quarter, against the 10-11 per cent previously forecast. Also, in April, a number of Mexican banks which had bought bonds offering 2 per cent above inflation are reported to have lost heavily as nominal rates have climbed to 16.5 per cent, 4.5 percentage points above expected inflation for 1992. The peso has been weak in the second quarter, which means that the dollar earnings of US-quoted companies - in particular Telmex, 25 per cent of the market, and Vitro, the country's largest industrial company  - will be lower than many US analysts expected. The bolsa nevertheless rallied this week, as many experienced investors believed that the market had over-reacted to the bad news. Mr Luis Pellat, an analyst at Banamex, argues that 'the market is undervalued with respect to the valuations we have for the companies. We see this as a moment to position ourselves for the long term'. The market has a prospective price/earnings ratio of 11 for 1992, down from 13 just one month ago. Whether this a good buy or not depends a large part on the mood in the US, and its inclination to invest in emerging markets. A flight to quality would hurt Mexico more than most, since it needs substantial capital inflows to finance its mushrooming current account deficit, expected to top Dollars 16bn this year. Mr Jorge Mariscal, manager of Latin American equities research at Goldman Sachs, says that Mexico has already been victimised by the bearish mood among international investors. He doubts that this will change in the short-term. 'I don't think the Mexican market will do much until the uncertainty over the US elections is resolved,' he says.</p>

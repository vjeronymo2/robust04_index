			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Rail sell-off poses royal train problem A QUESTION mark has been put over the future arrangements for running the royal train as a result of the government's plans for privatising British Rail. Department of Transport officials are discussing with Buckingham Palace what would happen to the train once the planned new regime of a track authority and franchise-holders operating services is in place. At present the train is run by British Rail. Ministers are confident that a deal securing the train's access to track can be agreed, given the prestige of the service. But the difficulty highlights the question of charges that will have to be paid to the track authority by anyone wanting to run a specialist service on the main network. If there are several franchisees running regional services, arranging for the royal train to run through a number of regions - for example from London to Balmoral - would be more complex than now. MPs are increasingly concerned with the cost of the royal family and the issue is likely to arise in parliamentary debate of the privatisation. In 1990-91 official royal family travel by train, including royal train maintenance, cost Pounds 1.4bn, while the royal train renewal programme cost Pounds 850,000.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Survey of Power for Europe (10): The outlook is bleak but it's not terminal - The future for coal COAL is coming under pressure as a power generation fuel in Europe, though reports of its imminent demise may turn out to be exaggerated: it will still be the largest single source of electricity in the region well into the next century. Two factors are at work. One is the policy of the Brussels Commission to reduce subsidies to the coal industry in the three major coal countries, the UK, Germany and Spain. The other is the steady tightening of environmental regulation. On one level this is reflected in the international commitments made at the Rio Earth Summit to cut down emissions of carbon dioxide, much of which is produced from power generation. On another, there is a raft of EC and national regulation aimed at reducing output of sulphur and nitrous oxides which are said to cause acid rain and other damage. Again, coal-fired power is partly to blame. The main piece of EC regulation is the 1988 Large Combustion Plants Directive which sets emission ceilings extending into the next century. This directive is due to be reviewed next year, and the chances are that the ceilings will be lowered, putting further pressure on coal-fired power. These trends are at their most stark in the UK which has the largest coal industry in Europe, but where recent events have pushed it into a state of crisis. Today, it finds itself caught between a government determined to put coal on to a commercial footing, and a power industry which finds other types of fuel, particularly gas, more attractive. Although the UK government was forced by a public outcry to review last year's decision to close down more than half the country's surviving coal mines, it still hopes to begin privatising British Coal, the state-owned monopoly, towards the end of this year. Once that goes ahead, there is little reason why British Coal should not cut to half its size quite rapidly. All that will cushion the blow is a temporary extension of the subsidies. The background to this is the steady erosion of coal's position in the electricity industry. In 1980, the UK produced nearly 100m tonnes of deep-mined coal, and generated over 70 per cent of its electricity from coal. Last year, power generators burnt only 75m tonnes of coal whose share of power generation fell to 60 per cent. And this trend will continue. Research commissioned by the UK government for its coal review from Caminus suggested that the power industry will only need 40m-49m tonnes by the year 1997-98, and that coal's share could fall below 50 per cent by then. Apart from the government's determination to phase out the Pounds 1bn-plus subsidies which the coal industry requires each year, the factors driving these changes are mainly cost. The newly privatised UK electricity industry views coal not just as an expensive fuel, but as one whose appeal will not improve over time, principally for environmental reasons. As a result of bygone energy policies, the UK has many of the largest coal-fired power stations in Europe, and the cost of cleaning them up is enormous. Drax, a 4,000MW station in Yorkshire owned by National Power, is being fitted with desulphurisation equipment at a cost of over Pounds 700m. This daunting expense is making the power industry wary of leaning too strongly on coal. At the moment only one other plant is being desulphurised, and it is looking increasingly unlikely that that number will rise very far. Instead, the generators are considering alternative ways of meeting the emission limits. These include running coal-fired stations for fewer hours, or abandoning coal altogether for cleaner fuels, in particular gas. A lot of gas station construction is already underway, and it is forecast that gas could account for the equivalent of 30m tonnes of coal-fired power generation by the end of the decade. The picture on the continent is not so stark. Countries with small coal industries are steadily winding them down as they become uneconomic. Belgium, once a big producer, stopped altogether at the beginning of this year. France expects to stop in 2005. But the larger producers are resisting major changes to coal because of the employment it provides and the lack of alternative fuels. In Germany, where hard coal is heavily subsidised and accounts for about a quarter of electricity generation, output is declining, but slowly. Consumption of coal for power generation, currently around 40m tonnes, is expected to decline to 35m over the next five years. 'It is a very different situation to the UK,' says Dr Adolf Spies, chairman of the German coal producers association. 'We have practically no oil and very little gas. Coal is the only resource we have . There is a strong security argument.' Germany is aiming to negotiate a new subsidy regime to replace the present one which expires in 1995. But though it hopes to make the new one more transparent, it will face pressure from Brussels which is trying to reduce aid in this area - other than for restructuring or final closure. A wholly separate question for Germany is what to do about the East German coal industry which it inherited with unification. Based on highly polluting brown coal, it requires a vast clean-up. Spain also supports its coal industry, the costliest in Europe, through state aid and consumer subsidies. But here too coal is probably at its peak. Spain's national energy plan foresees coal consumption levelling off, with an increasing proportion coming from cheaper open cast sources. Coal's deeply entrenched position will be its salvation for some time. One question is whether it could ever make a comeback as new technology allows it to be burnt more cleanly, and production costs come down. Mr Crispian Hotson, chief executive of Ryan Group, an independent coal company in the UK which hopes to take advantage of the changes in the market, believes it could. He envisions a number of small clean-burning power stations of 200MW close to coal sources. 'Coal becomes an interesting business when they create genuine competition for it,' he says.</p>

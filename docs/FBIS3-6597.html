The status quo of North Korea's missile  development is gaining much interest after foreign news reported  that North Korea is developing new ground-to-ground missiles  tentatively named "Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2" with ranges from  2,000 to 3,500 km.    In connection with this, a government intelligence source  said, "It is true that North Korea is developing new missiles  with a range of 2,000 to 3,500 km. ROK and U.S. intelligence  authorities are closely tracking this." With North Korea's  development of new missiles, the first thing of concern is the  relationship between the already known Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, and  Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2.    North Korea began developing the Nodong No. 1 in 1989 and  successfully test-launched it for the first time in May 1993.  It has a range of 1,000 km which covers Tokyo, Japan but has  not been deployed to an actual fighting position. The existence  of the Nodong No. 2 was first known in last year's U.S. Senate  report, but its specifications have not yet been confirmed. Its  range is estimated to be 1,500 to 2,000 km and a prototype is  expected to be introduced next year.    The Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 are the newest missiles  discovered  at a missile research center in Sanum-tong, Pyongyang by a U.S.  spy satellite in February 1994 . That was the first time the  U.S. spy satellite discovered the missiles stacked in the open  air with improved Scud B missiles and Nodong No. 1's. Judging  from the size of the propellants, Taepodong No. 1 is estimated  to have a range of 2,000 km, and Taepodong No. 2 approximately  3,500 km.    Considering that the range of the Taepodong No. 1 is  estimated to be 2,000 km, ROK and U.S. intelligence officials  are reportedly closely analyzing the possibility of this being  the Nodong No. 2.    Specialists are focusing their attention on the background  of  the fact that North Korea developed various types of new  missiles in only one year and keeps expanding the ranges of  missiles.    Usually, it takes several years to develop just one type of  missile and it is also questionable that North Korea keeps  expanding the ranges, although only 1,000 km would cover the  Korean peninsula and major regions of Japan.    Specialists believe that, as in the case of Nodong Nos. 1  and  2, the new missiles are being developed at the order of Middle  Eastern countries, including Iran, for exports to the region, or  are aimed to cover major U.S. bases in the Pacific, including  Guam.    Others also point out that these may be false prototypes  considering that North Korea displayed them in the open air  knowing that they were under the surveillance of U.S. spy  satellites.    Specialists analyze that even if North Korea develops and  deploys Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 in actual fighting, these will be  of less threat to South Korea than Scud B or improved Scub B's  because, like Nodong Nos. 1 and 2, Taepodong Nos. 1 and 2 also  use a Scud B as the main body but reduce the weight of warheads  to expand the range, and thus their accuracy and destructive  power are inferior to those of the Scud B.    However, ROK and U.S. authorities believe that if North  Korea's missile development continues with this trend, it may be  able to develop strategic mid-range ballistic missiles with a  4,000 to 5,000-km range in the near future and create  missile-phobia in Northeast Asia. The authorities are seeking  various countermeasures while closely watching North Korea's  missile development trend.

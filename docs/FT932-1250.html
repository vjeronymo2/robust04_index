			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: The logic of building a bigger estate - Philip Rawstorne examines Greenalls' planned Pounds 214m takeover of JA Devenish GREENALLS' Pounds 214.3m offer for Devenish aims to create an independent national retailer with more than 2,000 pubs and a purchasing clout that will ensure keenly-priced supply deals with the leading brewers. It is a trend that began with the government-enforced disposal of 11,000 pubs by the national brewers and is expected to gather pace in the next few years. Even the smallest pub chains - many of them new entrants in the market  - are securing discounts on beer supplies as the brewers fight for share in the expanding free trade. Some beer is being sold at half the list price. However, the battle will inevitably result in the closure of more breweries and the restoration of balance between supply and demand. Small retailers may then find the terms of trade turning against them. Only the big chains are likely to be able to negotiate with the brewers on equal terms. Greenalls' acquisition of Devenish would add 550 pubs to the group's present estate of 1,450 - achieving in a single move a substantial increase that would take years to build on a pub-by-pub basis. Its beer sales would rise from an annual 650,000 barrels to about 850,000 barrels - a volume that any brewer would be eager to secure. The deal would add other useful cards to Greenalls' hand. The combined estate would offer brewers widespread national distribution of their brands. Greenalls strength lies in north-west England and the Midlands. Devenish has a presence in London and the southern counties as well as its base in the south-west. Food sales have become an increasingly important contributor to profits of Greenalls' 760 managed houses and of Devenish's 260 managed outlets. With Greenalls' hotel interests, it is estimated that the combined group would be buying Pounds 28m of food a year. The enlarged group should also gain from cross fertilisation of retailing ideas as well as the elimination of duplicate costs. Altogether, the merger would take Greenalls a logical step further along the strategic course on which it set out with the closure of its breweries in 1990. The market after the 1989 Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry would offer better growth prospects as a retailer than as a regional brewer, Mr Andrew Thomas, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Peter Greenall, group managing director, decided. The company's share structure - which had guaranteed the Greenall family's control for 230 years - was revised the following year, and was followed last year by an Pounds 86m rights issue to fund expansion. For the Devenish board, which fought off a Pounds 120m hostile bid from Boddington, another pub retailer, in 1991, the Greenalls' offer was one that could not be refused. The Devenish management, which dubbed the Boddington bid as 'undervalued and opportunistic' has had to operate since with the predator, a 19.5 per cent shareholder, still brooding in the background over another bid. Talks with Greenalls have been going on for over a year. Mr John Clark, Devenish deputy chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: 'The offer represents a premium of 52 per cent to net assets and we felt it had to be accepted for the benefit of shareholders.' The price, according to industry analysts, was pitched generously enough to freeze out any possible counter-bid from Boddington. Its decision yesterday to take the cash, and a profit of about Pounds 15m on the deal, enables it to emerge from the situation without loss of face. However, there is little doubt that Boddington was bracing itself for another bid. The disappointment at being outflanked must be acute - and there is a danger now that the one-time predator may become the prey for others in the market.</p>

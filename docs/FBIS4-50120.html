			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "MFN Trading Status and Sino-U.S. Ties"] </F>   [Text] Reports say that U.S. State Department is studying  and drafting various options on extending China's most favored  nation [MFN] trading status, to be presented to Clinton for him  to choose. The United States does not have much time or options  to resolve this question. The best way is to extend China's MFN  status unconditionally. This will benefit the two powers as  well as the stability and prosperity of the world at large.    When meeting with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger  the day before yesterday, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said  that Sino- U.S. relations are not just limited to the two sides,  they are closely linked to the international situation. China  and the United States should maintain good relations for the  sake of world peace and stability. As two big powers which can  influence the world, China and the United States shoulder great  responsibility for the future of the world and the destiny of  mankind. We should do something for people of the world. Jiang  Zemin looked at Sino-U.S. relations from the macroscopic  viewpoint of the developing situation of the world as a whole.  This should give U.S. policymakers much food for thought.    Following the end of the Cold War, some people in Western  political circles thought that the Soviet Union had  disintegrated and that it was no longer necessary to attach  importance to ties with China. They even thought that the 1989  Beijing disturbance could be used to force China to take the  same road of the Soviet Union. Facts have totally shattered  these people's dreams. China was not and will never be a card  to be played by any country. China has its own weight. As a  big country with the largest population and quickest economic  growth in the world, China's stability and development will  nurture the development of the Asia-Pacific region and also  maintain peace in the region. Peace and stability are  inseparable major issues which the world is now facing. China  has made tremendous efforts and contributions to the solution of  these two issues. The IMF, World Bank, and UN Food and  Agriculture Organization and Population Organization, as well as  industrial and commercial tycoons from the developed nations and  the transnational corporations, have all affirmed China's  achievements and are optimistic about China.    The United States is the largest developed nation and the  only superpower in the world. Nixon's visit to China 23 years  ago opened up a new chapter in Sino-U.S. relations. Thanks to  the reform and opening up introduced by China, Sino-U.S.  economic and trade ties have developed rapidly and the two  countries have become important trading partners. Economic and  trade ties have become increasingly important in bilateral  relations. This conforms with the trend of contemporary  international relations whereby economic interests constitute  the main factor. The increasingly close economic and trade ties  between the most populous country and the most developed nation  in the world will naturally be conducive to world peace and  stability. The ideal option should be cooperation and  construction rather than confrontation and war. A relatively  open market is one of the characteristics of the U.S. economy,  which has benefited the United States tremendously. The flow of  cheap and good products from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to the  U.S. market is welcomed by U.S. consumers. Meanwhile, large  numbers of U.S. industrial and agricultural products have also  entered China along with the country's modernization program.  Many large U.S. companies have discovered that China is the  irreplaceable and last big market which can offer them enormous  opportunities.    Under such circumstances, if the Clinton administration  insist on taking the question of human rights, which has nothing  to do with economy and trade, or even the question of Tibet, as  bargaining chips and link these issues with the MFN status, this  will never be accepted by the Chinese Government and people. It  is true that China's economy will be affected without MFN status  but the United States will also suffer great losses. More  importantly, it will produce an impact on the situation in the  Asia-Pacific region and the world as a whole. If the United  States chooses the option of confrontation with China, its  interests affected will not be limited to the field of economy  and trade. The United States tried to hinder and block New  China for a long time during the Cold War and this did not  benefit it in the slightest. It was President Nixon who changed  U.S. policy toward China and this is a lesson to remember.    The number of people from various U.S. circles supporting  unconditional extension of China's MFN status is increasing, far  exceeding those who are against. Since taking office, Clinton  has not made any achievements in domestic affairs or diplomacy.  If China's MFN status is revoked, the grave consequences will  not help him running for another term of the presidency, still  less the U.S. manufacturers and consumers. The United States  should unconditionally extend China's MFN status. We believe  that the United States, in consideration of the long-term  interests and proceeding from the overall situation, will make a  rational choice.</p>

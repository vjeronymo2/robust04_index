			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Moscow ready to impose HIV tests on visitors Foreigners entering Russia will be required to undergo HIV tests at the border or produce medical certificates showing they have not been exposed to the Aids virus, under legislation Moscow is expected to adopt soon. A western diplomat said yesterday the European Union, the US, Canada and Japan were considering a joint appeal to President Boris Yeltsin to urge him to veto the legislation. It would be the toughest law of its kind to be adopted by a large and influential country and could discourage business travellers and tourists. Western diplomats are concerned about the technical difficulties Russian border officials might face in determining the validity of foreign medical certificates, and the health risks visitors might face if they undergo HIV tests in Russia, where needles are regularly re-used and often poorly sterilised. However, it would be difficult if not impossible for Mr Yeltsin to block the measure. Officials at the parliamentary commission on health, which produced the draft law, said they were confident that the bill, which is scheduled for a third reading in the State Duma either today or next week, would be passed by the lower house. It would then need to be endorsed by the Federation Council, the upper house, and signed by Mr Yeltsin. A presidential veto could be overruled by a two-thirds vote in the Duma, which parliamentary officials are certain they could muster. The legislation, which in its second reading was opposed by only three of the 450 deputies in the Duma, has found reluctant supporters among Russian liberals. They fear that the nation's collapsing healthcare system is too weak to protect the country against diseases which are a malign side-effect of growing contacts with the rest of the world. Ms Svetlana Ulitskaya, the chief expert at the parliamentary commission on health, said: 'We have an unpleasant choice. Either we can be civilised and let Aids into our country or we must look uncivilised and close the door.' Mr Valerii Mestnikov, another health commission official, said the Russian public was unconcerned about the potential damage the law might do to western investment and tourism as they had not seen any positive results so far. According to Professor Richard Clogg, a fellow at St Antony's College, Oxford, Russia more than a year ago began to require all travellers from the embattled Black Sea enclave of Abkhazia to undergo an HIV test at the Russian border.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Based on petitioner's allegations that Grupo Tropicales was selling roses in Argentina at prices below its COP, and information on the record, the Department had a reasonable basis to suspect or believe that sales were made below cost and therefore initiated a COP investigation to determine whether Grupo Tropicales had Argentine sales that were made at prices less than their COP. Although Grupo Tropicales also had third country sales to Germany, we did not initiate a COP investigation on these sales because they were not included in petitioner's COP allegation ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> the September 8, 1994, memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For a discussion of our COP test methodology, see the ``Home Market Sales'' section above. We made no adjustments to the COP and CV data submitted by Grupo Tropicales. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to calculate FMV, we made company-specific adjustments as described below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Grupo Clavecol <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Grupo Clavecol, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in Argentina and Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country to purchase price comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight, air freight, and brokerage and handling, where applicable. Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, air freight and brokerage and handling. We also deducted the weighted-average Argentine and Canadian indirect selling expenses, including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1). We deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Grupo Sabana <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Grupo Sabana, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in Canada. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country price to purchase price comparisons, we made deductions for Canadian inland freight, air freight, Canadian import duties, U.S. brokerage and Colombian inland freight. Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for Canadian inland freight, air freight, Canadian import duties, Canadian brokerage and Colombian inland freight. In addition, we made deductions for credit and direct selling expenses in Canada. We also deducted the weighted-average Canadian and Colombian indirect selling expenses, including, where appropriate, inventory carrying costs, up to the amount of the greater of related party commissions or indirect selling expenses incurred on U.S. sales, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(b)(1). We deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Grupo Tropicales <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Grupo Tropicales, we calculated FMV based on delivered prices to unrelated customers in Argentina and Germany. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country price to purchase price comparisons, we made deductions for foreign inland freight. Pursuant to section 773(a)(4)(B) and 19 CFR 353.56(a)(2), we made circumstance of sale adjustments, where appropriate, for credit expenses. We deducted third country packing costs and added U.S. packing costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For third country price to ESP comparisons, we made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight.

These three companies were: Agrorosas S.A.; Flores Mocari S.A. and Rosex LTDA. We calculated CV based on the sum of respondent's cost of cultivation, plus general expenses, profit and U.S. packing. For general expenses, we used the greater of the reported general expenses or the statutory minimum of ten percent of the cost of cultivation. For profit, we used the greater of the weighted average third country profit during the POI or the statutory minimum of eight percent of the cost of cultivation and total SG&amp;A expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.50(a)(2). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these respondents, we based the amortization expense upon amounts normally recorded by each company in their usual record keeping. We rejected adjustments that companies made to the amortization expense solely for purposes of this investigation. We also made specific adjustments to respondents' CV data as described below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Agrorosas S.A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Agrorosas S.A., we did not consider the minor pre-verification correction filed on September 9, 1994 for the preliminary determination. This data will be fully analyzed for our final determination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Flores Mocari S.A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Flores Mocari S.A., we revised the calculation of interest expense to express the expense as a per-unit amount. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Rosex LTDA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

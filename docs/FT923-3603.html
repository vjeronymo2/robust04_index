			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / The Property Market: Seconds out . . . - The first shots have been fired in a battle to boost the image of London Docklands In the right hand corner stands Knocker, a man who buys his Christmas cards in the January sales and thinks Concorde should never have taken off. Facing him is Docker, who believes the Channel Tunnel is a good idea, even if it only means that you get a better croissant, and that an office is not just space, it is a 'wavelength'. The battleground is London Docklands: Knocker wishes it were never built; Docker welcomes every penny spent on it. Round one got under way this week. Knocker and Docker are the characters in a quirky advertising campaign launched this week in national newspapers aimed at beefing up the image of London Docklands. After the battering docklands has received in the past year - the collapse of Canary Wharf and thousands of square metres of office space awaiting tenants - it needs this shot in the arm. The campaign has been greeted with as much derision as acclaim. Admirers conceded that it would be hard to identify with either stereotype. If anything, Knocker, the rational, thrifty and conservative dullard, is more in tune with recessionary Britain than his trendy, cavalier counterpart. But D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles, the advertising company which created the campaign for the London Docklands Development Corporation (LDDC), thinks the advertisements will help overcome the prejudice surrounding docklands. More important, the Pounds 600,000, four-week campaign is designed to attract the attention of businesses considering relocation. 'All we can hope to do is to get people to open their minds. I think we have a neat way of pricking people's consciences,' says Mr Graham Hinton, joint chief executive of DMB&amp;B. Ironically, the company has had problems in persuading its own staff about the merits of its planned move to Canary Wharf. The Docklands campaign is perhaps the most prominent of several new property marketing drives to be launched this autumn. Property marketing became big business in the buoyant late-1980s. Marketing a property once involved producing a simple brochure and placing an advertisement in a trade magazine. In the mid-1980s this gave way to lavish launches, elaborate brochures, hoardings, radio advertising and extravagant 'freebies'. Agents were - and sometimes still are - enticed to receptions with the promise of free whisky, shirts and televisions. But with the industry reeling from the effects of recession, the pendulum is now swinging back to more austere ways. At a time of financial stringency, the effectiveness of marketing - and the thousands of pounds spent on launches and advertising - has rarely been under greater scrutiny. As a result, developers are cutting back their advertising budgets and increasingly relying on agents to market their building. 'In the heyday, developers would spend Pounds 1 a square foot on marketing,' says Mr Charles Okin of Edward Charles, a West End property agency. 'It is now down to half that.' Today, property owners are not even convinced they need to advertise to attract tenants. MEPC, for instance, argues that in the current state of the market, companies which are looking for new premises do employ agents. Since the agent's job is to know which property is on the market, advertising is often an avoidable expense. Many other landlords believe that since they already pay agents to market their properties, there is no reason why they should duplicate efforts by doing their own marketing. The marketing specialists, not surprisingly, reject this viewpoint. 'The developers who are stopping marketing are shooting themselves in the foot,' says Mr Rob Gilbert of Gilbert Doyle, one of Europe's largest property advertising agencies. He argues that not all potential tenants employ agents. Moreover, a landlord who relies on his own agent to market his property may receive a poor service because agents often have dozens of properties on their books - all of which must be marketed. The core of Mr Doyle's argument is that marketing costs relatively little compared with the costs of keeping an office block empty. Landlords, of course, are only too aware of this. But that does not diminish the challenge for the agents, marketing, public relations and advertising specialists in persuading property owners that they can secure tenants. It is a sign of the times that none of these specialists can be too boastful about their efficacy. After all, skilled marketing cannot overcome deficiencies in the product or its location. In Docklands, for instance, every advertising strategy has been tried and found to be flawed. At one end of the scale there are brash advertisements about the cheapness of premises; Wyn-Ro Investments used such tactics to market South Quay Plaza last year. At the other end of the scale is Canary Wharf, which employed senior figures from advertising and banking who still found it difficult to attract tenants. Specialists point to some basic guidelines when marketing a property. Most fundamental is that properties need to be in their best condition when being viewed. 'Inspections are like gold dust. You can't waste the opportunity,' says Mr Charles Okin. Another important point is to play on the building's merits. If a building is architecturally or environmentally distinguished, this should be emphasised. Landlords should also employ direct methods to reach potential tenants, bypassing their agents. 'More and more we are trying to get directly to tenants,' says Mr Rob Gilbert of Gilbert Doyle. He suggests that brochures, letters and research findings should be sent directly to managing directors of companies looking for new premises. A more subtle if less well-targetted approach than sending out junk mail is enticing potential tenants to see the building on another pretence. Drama, exhibitions and even wine tasting are common baits. One example is the National Museum of Cartoon Art, which opens its first exhibition next week in a 19th century office block owned by Lynton, the property arm of BAA. As well as attracting possibly influential people to the building, there is a 'feel good, altruistic' message about benefitting the arts, says Mr Iain Taylor of Hudson Sandler, Lynton's publicity adviser. Another tactic, this time for Imry's building in Grosvenor Street, is wine tasting in conjunction with Grants of St James, the up-market wine seller. 'It is important that the invitation comes from Grants of St James,' says Mr Taylor. He says the costs of such an event are comparable to placing an advertisement in the trade press, but generate 150 viewings at a stroke. It is hardly a surprise that landlords should be cynical about marketing; but at the same time they know they cannot ignore it. As Lord Leverhulme, founder of consumer products group Unilever, once famously remarked, half the money spent on advertising is wasted; the difficulty is knowing which half.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CAPITAL GROWTH (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Retail   Office   Industrial   All Properties  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Year to July 92           -0.1    -12.9       -3.1          -5.7 Quarter to July 92        -0.1     -3.4       -2.4          -1.8 Month of July 92          -0.1     -1.1       -0.7          -0.6  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Investment Property Databank  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHARED HOUSING OFFERS SINGLE MOMS RECOURSE;  </P> <P> SOCIAL SERVICES: A NEW SOUTH COUNTY GROUP IS BRINGING LOW-INCOME MOTHERS  TOGETHER AND MATCHING THEM WITH SENIORS WILLING TO SHARE A HOME.  </P> <P> Michelle Ellis works and lives in Mission Viejo.  </P> <P> But home for Ellis, 23, and her 10-month-old son, Ryan, is not one of the  expensive houses that have mushroomed in this sprawling, affluent South County  community. It's her tan 1983 Toyota Camry parked on the street in front of the  home where she works as a housekeeper during the day.  </P> <P> Ellis is among a growing number of low-income single mothers who can no longer  afford the high cost of housing and child care in South County. Like Ellis,  many single mothers are homeless, while others are "just a man away" from  living on the streets, officials of several local social agencies say.  </P> <P> The phenomenon is part of a national trend that has recently caught the  attention of several Orange County agencies.  </P> <P> A report released last month by the National Displaced Homemakers Network in  Washington indicates that 47.6% of single mothers -- those who have never  married or, if previously married, now work full time to support their children  -- live with incomes at or near poverty levels. The report, based on census  data, also notes that the number of single mothers grew from 3.2 million in  1980 to 5.8 million in 1989.  </P> <P> Detailed statistics for Orange County are not available, but Larry Leaman,  director of the Orange County Social Services Agency, said that at least 17,000  single mothers in the county live on welfare.  </P> <P> The number has increased by 10% each year since 1988, he said. "Each mother  accounts for two kids, so we're looking at a lot of people getting by on a  minimal subsistence," Leaman said.  </P> <P> The increase is straining the resources of social service agencies, many of  which rely on private donations and volunteer workers to meet the needs of  their clients.  </P> <P> Ellen Gilchrist, program manager of the Episcopal Service Alliance/South  County, said that at least 30% of the 2,000 people who seek help from her  agency each month are single mothers.  </P> <P> They also account for 25% of the homeless people who live in the agency's  Anchor House shelter in San Clemente, Gilchrist said.  </P> <P> "It's a crisis, and the sad part is few people know about the problem," said  Lynn Joseph, a San Juan Capistrano businesswoman who recently helped form an  organization called Single Mothers in Partnership.  </P> <P> "The problem just slipped through the cracks," Joseph continued. "We're going  to have a young generation out there who will remember their childhood growing  up on the streets."  </P> <P> For the most part, the creation of Single Mothers was serendipitous. Joseph, a  partner in an executive search firm, said she felt the need to contribute  "something back to the community."  </P> <P> Four months ago, she told Dr. Thomas Habib, a clinical psychologist, that she  would be interested in volunteering some of her time.  </P> <P> Habib, director of psychological services at South County Community Clinic,  seized the opportunity to help form a new agency.  </P> <P> "In my practice, I see many cases where marriages end up in divorce and the  mother faces hardship," Habib said. "At times I have three or four single moms  on my caseload at once. . . . But for ethical reasons, I couldn't bring them  together. I would say to myself, 'Boy, I wish there was an organization to put  them together.' "  </P> <P> For the last three months, Joseph has been busy contacting social agencies and  circulating flyers advertising a July 27 mixer that will be held in the  gymnasium of Mission San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> The event will include brief workshops on sharing housing and caring for  children, but the main purpose is to put single mothers in contact with others  in similar situations. Interested people can call (714) 493-0050 to register.  </P> <P> Habib said the new organization is advocating formation of so-called  three-generation families involving the child, the parent and a senior. "We are  desperately seeking elderly people who are looking to share life's experiences  with single mothers," the psychologist said. "Elderly people are so important  to us. People don't become obsolete; they just need to feel needed."  </P> <P> The idea of shared housing is not new to Orange County. Seventeen independent  shared-housing programs in the county comprise the Shared Housing Coordination  Project, a venture funded by the Orange County Housing Authority. But none is  specifically geared toward single mothers.  </P> <P> "Single mothers are the hardest to place" in shared housing, said Roberto  Melendez, the project's coordinator. "That's why (such an organization) is  extremely needed in the community. We are called repeatedly by single parents  who wish to cut housing costs by rooming with a senior. . . . But many  (seniors) do not want to act as baby-sitters to children."  </P> <P> Melendez and Leaman said Single Mothers would fill a gap in Orange County.  "Shared housing is a matter of economic reality," Leaman said. "We are  intrigued by the attempt to do something about the problem (in South County)."  </P> <P> Many single mothers encounter hardship when they lose financial support through  separation or divorce. The majority are in low-paying jobs and cannot afford  the high cost of renting an apartment in South County along with child-care  expenses.  </P> <P> When Beth Powell, 20, got divorced and left El Paso with her 2 1/2-year-old  daughter, Reagan, for Mission Viejo, the culture shock was immediate: A  two-bedroom apartment that cost $350 per month in El Paso was $800 in South  County. A baby-sitter cost $400 a month, compared to $200 in El Paso.  </P> <P> "It was absolutely incredible," said Powell, who earns $1,000 a month as an  assistant manager of a Laguna Hills clothing store. "I'm still in shock. I  thought about moving back to El Paso, because there's no way I could make it on  my own here."  </P> <P> Powell said she needs to acquire a college education to earn a better salary.  She had signed up for classes at Saddleback College, but her work schedule and  time spent caring for Reagan prevented her from attending.  </P> <P> Now she sees hope in the opportunity offered by Single Mothers.  </P> <P> "I'm hoping I can find someone compatible with myself and my daughter," Powell  said. "I think someone with another child would be more flexible, more  understanding."  </P> <P> Despite all her problems, Ellis -- who lives in her car in Mission Viejo --  believes she has been fortunate since separating from her drug-addicted  boyfriend a few months ago. She said she decided to leave her boyfriend's  apartment after he became physically and verbally abusive to her and her child.  </P> <P> Now she uses the $400 she earns monthly to take care of herself and baby Ryan.  "If I had to go to a normal job, I would have to get someone to see my baby,"  she said. "But I couldn't afford that."  </P> <P> * SHELTERS SWAMPED  </P> <P> Many homeless people are being turned away as the demand for beds soars. B12  </P></p>

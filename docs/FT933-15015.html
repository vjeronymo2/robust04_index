			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Sport: Revenge of the Vitamins - Cricket IT WAS my fault. I had been to my local greengrocer's shop every day of the week before the Intellectuals' annual match. Mark, the greengrocer, was our secret weapon. Many the hour we had spent solving Gooch's problems and planning the Intellectuals' triumph, while I bought my bananas. The trouble was, I forgot to remind him that he was Intellectual batsman-and- bowler-in-chief and he forgot. The rest of us arrived at the ground for a picnic lunch in the sunshine. Our heroic long-distance contingent did its customary drive across the country, from the Welsh border to East Anglia, driven by Charles, his car frothing with children. Will, an umpire who passed from the playful to the judicial role when his hip joints locked up a few years ago, practised his walking by getting off the train 30 miles away and completing his journey on foot. Even so, he looked well. Both umpires looked well, Will in his shorts, with an air of amiability, Diana in her yellow trousers and pink T-shirt, with an air of majesty. Our problem was the opposition, the Vitamins. Their air was one of determination. Sunshine and noble umpires shone in the shadow of Vitamin ambition. They had lost last year and they must win this year. With characteristic stoicism, we watched an ample enemy batsman make an ample half-century before retiring, to our forlorn applause. Much though I dislike the ruthless professionalism of modern cricket, I felt a twinge of deeper dislike for the cavalier kindness I thought I loved. It is so humiliating. Anyone who has been the victim of an opponent's retirement will understand the misery that accompanies the relief. With the Vitamins at 116 for 0 after 16 overs, I knew that the Intellectuals played for love of the game, not victory. Everyone in our team bowled three overs, except a lawyer, Martyn, who donned the gloves without complaint when we found we had no-one else. Only one word describes our bowling throughout this match: unpredictable. Our young West Indian opening bowler sent down some good deliveries, including plenty that troubled the keeper, but few that troubled the batsmen. Our New Zealand new recruit from the heights of cricket literature, Graeme, assumed greengrocer Mark's position as top performer. His fast medium pace nearly, so nearly, gave us the early break-through we needed. What Graeme gave us instead of wickets was style. He arrived in an open car with his girlfriend, who reclined gracefully while we toiled through the agreed 30 overs, limiting the opposition to 223 for 4. My off-breaks were grotesque, adorned only by their originality. My husband's leg-breaks, formal in approach, modest in pace, saved our bowling honour by hitting the stumps. But only once. It was a dead pitch, no good for bowlers. No good for our bowlers, anyway. More disconcertingly, it appeared to be a dead captain in command of the Vitamins. He had an off-white face, presumably plastered with white grease-paint, which gazed at us from underneath an overhanging hat. His pale limbs were aired in a flapping shirt and long-legged shorts. He found running a struggle, wheezing and staggering, not sharing his team's grim preference for boundaries. Tea is an under-rated meal. I am the first to pass it off with a quick cupful, but oppressed by our target of more than seven an over and our modest ability, I sank happily into an iced bottleful. Not, I hasten to add, that the wine was the reason I batted badly. It was because I was born a tonker. After a deep-rooted tea, with defeat impending and grinning Vitamins clustered round the bat, I could not resist a swipe, which let the ball remove the bails. As our meteorologist opening batsmen said when his wife asked whether he had seen the ball that bowled him for a duck: 'I heard it.' Haunted by those woody rattles, we decided to run for everything we could while we could. Undaunted by his efforts in the car and in the field, Charles batted powerfully. He hit the ball over the heads of fielders and ran fast. His run-out was tragic because he was hitting the ball well, even when it was delivered disdainfully slowly. The run-out had an element of the operatic about it, involving a mid-run re-arrangement between the batsmen and conference between bowler, keeper and stray fielders. Charles expired like a doom-laden hero. My husband's run-out was more wistful, as he attempted a possible but not probable run disliked by Graeme at the other end. Graeme kept his running safe, his bat straight and his style intact. He top scored for the Intellectuals and his dismissal had an exotic, almost a continental flavour: caught and bowled De Luca 34. A little further down the order, Godfrey left the university manuscripts and supported the intellectual life with his bat. Brave, quiet and dignified, he delighted his disheartened team, huddled on the pavilion steps, with the correctness of his shots. Between shots, he leaned lightly on his bat. Umpire Diana stood serene and still, above daft appeals for things like obstructing the light. A regal presence. When Godfrey was finally bowled for 27, there was only the divine to talk to the regal. Our Dominican friar, David, ran out of partners. Or rather, left them behind. He preferred big hitting to running, smiting even the immense Vitamin bowler unused to punishment. With God on his side, David finished the game not out on a defeated team and joined us for dinner, to plot next year's ploys. In the dark of night we sank to the most demonic of all ploys: practice.</p>

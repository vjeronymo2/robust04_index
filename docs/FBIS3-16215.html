The plenary meeting, which began in the government residence  in Dushanbe on Tuesday morning, has heard reports of General  Pyankov and Chechulin about the situation on the Tajik-Afghan  border, in and around the republic.    The plenary session was followed by talks in a narrower  format, including between Russian Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and Tajik Foreign Minister Rashid Olimov.    A Russian delegation member told ITAR-TASS the ministers  have  not yet decided whether or what documents should be adopted as a  result of their meeting.    Generals Pyankov and Chechulin told journalists that the  possibility of a intra-Tajik dialogue was discussed in general,  but he did not rule out the possibility of talks between the  Dushanbe government and the opposition in March and April.    Andrey Kozyrev is due to fly to the 12th border post of the  Pyanj border group, where two attempts of penetrating Tajikistan  from Afghanistan were reported last night.    Later today Kozyrev is due to meet Tajikistan's leader  Emomali Rakhmonov for one-to-one talks.</p>

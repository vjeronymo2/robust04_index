			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Spenddown of ``Tainted'' Funded Depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The preamble to the August 30, 1991 final rule also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed the issue of spenddown (56 FR 43421). ``Spenddown''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a process whereby we permit providers to ``cure'' borrowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was found to be unnecessary because of available funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation by using those funded depreciation funds for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proper purpose. Under spenddown, if additional deposits are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made to funded depreciation after the unnecessary borrowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination, withdrawals from the funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsequent to a determination of unnecessary borrowing are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> made on a last-in, first-out basis (typically, withdrawals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a proper purpose are made on a first-in, first-out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis). The result of this policy is that all additional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deposits to funded depreciation must be used before spending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be allotted to the ``tainted'' funds, that is, the portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the funded depreciation that resulted in the unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowing. In addition, Medicare's policy has been that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other funded depreciation funds in the account at the time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the unnecessary borrowing must be used before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``tainted'' funds can be spent down or cured.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the publication of the August 30, 1991 final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, we have received several inquiries asking why our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy on spenddown was not incorporated into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. These inquiries also have pointed out that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last-in, first-out method set forth at &sect;413.134(e)(3)(i)(C)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will not work properly when the unnecessary borrowing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaid from the funded depreciation account and that account  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained untainted funded depreciation at the time of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary borrowing or received additional deposits after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the borrowing. The inquirers suggested that this situation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be rectified by establishing an exception to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> last-in, first-out rule when the unnecessary borrowing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused the ``tainting'' is repaid out of funded depreciation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this case, any use of funded depreciation to repay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary borrowing will be deemed to be from ``tainted''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funded depreciation. We agree and propose to provide for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such an exception in &sect;413.134(e)(2)(iv).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, where the provider repays part or all of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal of the unnecessary borrowing that caused the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``tainted'' funded depreciation by using general funds, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corresponding amount of the ``tainted'' funded depreciation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must be cured. This is necessary so that the ``tainted''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portion of the funded depreciation does not exceed the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of the balance of the unnecessary borrowing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> caused the ``tainting'' in the first place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We are proposing to revise &sect;413.134(e) to incorporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the curing process of ``tainted'' funded depreciation and also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to provide that the provider's subsequent repayment of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principal portion of the unnecessary borrowing will be from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``tainted'' funds in the funded depreciation. Thus,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> neither the first-in, first-out nor the last-in, first-out  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis would be applicable for such repayments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Necessary and Unnecessary Borrowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In February 1977, HCFA published &sect;203 of the Provider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reimbursement Manual to address interest on loans in excess  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of asset value acquired after 1970. Section 203.D of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual states that ``[r]epayments of the funds borrowed are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied first to reducing the portion of the loan applied to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the allowable cost of the patient care assets, then to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tangible and intangible assets not considered reasonably  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> related to patient care, and lastly to goodwill.'' We have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied this long-standing principle to cases where a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider repays borrowed funds where some of these funds are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deemed to be unnecessary. In these circumstances, we have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held that all of necessary borrowing must be repaid before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the repayments may be applied to the unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also apply this principle to unnecessary borrowing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that causes ``tainted'' funded depreciation. When a portion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a provider's borrowing is considered unnecessary because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the availability of funded depreciation, subsequent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayments, whether from funded depreciation or general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds, are first applied to the allowable portion of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowing and, when all of the allowable borrowing is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repaid, to the unallowable portion of the loan. This places  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the provider in the same position as if the available funded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> depreciation had been used without any unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

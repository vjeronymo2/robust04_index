			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Hold the line on inflation, says Bundesbank THE Bundesbank yesterday made a powerful appeal to western countries not to relax their vigilance against inflation and to reject the idea that more employment could be achieved through steeper price rises. In its annual report, the German central bank said it was too early to sound the 'all clear' on inflation. A lasting decline in interest rates could only occur on the basis of stable monetary policies. Coming ahead of Sunday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington, the Bundesbank's statement reinforced its commitment to a tight monetary policy at a time of growing inflationary pressures. The bank is resisting US pressures to ease its policies. Bundesbank officials have expressed concern about the level of domestic wage settlements - running at about 7 per cent  - and the likely impact of tax rises on inflation. The bank built in a low price increase level of 2 per cent into its money supply goal for 1991, but economists now expect the consumer price index to be nearer 4 per cent by the year-end. The Bundesbank did not say so in its report, but it has made clear it has no intention of lowering interest rates for some time. It last raised its discount and lombard rates by half a point to 6.5 and 9 per cent respectively on January 31. Economists in Germany and abroad feel a further rise is possible later this year. Although countries' different economic conditions provided scope for varying interest rate developments, the Bundesbank said: 'It should not be overlooked that inflationary pressure remains high worldwide.' Despite the cooling down of the world economy, inflation rates in the most important industrialised countries had been above those of 1989. The bank also said it saw little chance of success in attempts to stabilise trends in foreign exchange markets, such as the dollar's movement, through intervention, though occasional interventions could calm markets. David Marsh adds from Bonn: Mr Reimut Jochimsen, the German central banker in the midst of a row over streamlining the structure of the Bundesbank, has urged the government to compromise to avoid a damaging political flare-up. Mr Jochimsen, president of the regional central bank of North Rhine-Westphalia, opposes the plan of Mr Karl Otto Pohl, the Bundesbank president, to lower the number of state (Land) central bankers on the Bundesbank's policy-making council. Mr Jochimsen, a member of the council since last August, urged the Bonn government to support his compromise proposal to increase the number of Land central banks by one to make allowance for German unification. Mr Pohl, by contrast, has suggested cutting the number from the present 11 in west Germany to eight in united Germany - an idea backed by the majority of the Bundesbank's 18-man council.</p>

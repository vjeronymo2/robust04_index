			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Students at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and Wayne State  University in Detroit continued sit-ins. UNM President Gerald May, whose outer  office has been held since Tuesday, said regents would soon reconsider a  $50-a-semester tuition hike to $686. About 40 protesters said they would  continue the sit-in but promised to tidy May's office, which has become  cluttered during the protest. In Detroit, about 70 black students who have  occupied the Wayne State student center since Wednesday said they will discuss  with administrators Monday demands for stepped-up minority student and faculty  recruitment and a requirement that each instructor teach an African-related  course.  </P></p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / European Elections '94: Christian Democrats cling on, but voters stay home - Netherlands The outcome of the Dutch elections for the European Parliament brought an unexpected victory for the Christian Democrats, partly softening the blow of their bruising defeat a month earlier in the country's general election. The Christian Democrats won an unchanged 10 seats, making the party of outgoing prime minister Ruud Lubbers the largest Dutch party in the European assembly. This marks a recovery from the May general election, when the Christian Democrats were replaced as the biggest party in the Netherlands by Labour. Labour won eight seats in the European Parliament, also unchanged from their 1989 result. However, Dutch representation in the European Parliament has increased to 31 seats from 25, meaning that both parties have seen relative declines in popularity. Voter turnout for the Dutch Euro-elections fell to a record low of 35.6 per cent, down sharply from 47 per cent five years ago. Mr Frits Castricum, a successful Labour candidate, said, 'With this kind of turnout, we all lose.' As in the general election, the biggest gains were recorded by D66, a left-of-centre party which jumped to four seats from one in 1989, and the right-wing Liberals, who doubled their previous three seats. The Christian Democrats hope their recovery at the polls may mean a small boost to Mr Lubbers' chances of succeeding Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. The campaign was short and subdued and marked by 'voter fatigue' after municipal elections in March and the general election in May. Unfortunately for the Christian Democrats, the low level of voting means the election cannot be seen as a protest against the continuing efforts by the other three parties - Labour, the Liberals and D66 - to form a new national government without them. Still, the Christian Democrats seem to have learned their lesson from their showing in the general election, when their support for a freeze of the state old-age pension caused an uproar.  ------------------------------------------- Population: 15.2m Seats: 31  ------------------------------------------- Results (Turnout 35.6%; 1989, 47.2%)  -------------------------------------------- Party*    Parliament    % vote       Seats             group     '94   '89   '94   '89  -------------------------------------------- CDA          EPP     30.8  34.6    10    10 PVDA         PES     22.9  30.7     8     8 VVD          LDR     17.9  13.6     6     3 D66          LDR     11.7   5.9     4     1 SGP           NA      7.8   5.9     2     1 Greens    Greens      3.7   7.0     1     2  -------------------------------------------- Source: European Parliament  -------------------------------------------- *Abbreviations:  -------------------------------------------- CDA = Christian Democrats; PVDA = Labour party; SGP = Staatkundig Gereformeerde; VVD = Freedom and Democracy party  -------------------------------------------- Parliamentary group abbreviations: see bottom front page this section  -------------------------------------------- Electoral system:  -------------------------------------------- Proportional from national lists Compulsory voting: No  -------------------------------------------- MEP  -------------------------------------------- Labour  -------------------------------------------- H d'Ancona, Frits Castricum, Piet Dankert, L van Bladel, W van Velzen, M van Putten, J Wiersma, A Metten  -------------------------------------------- Christian Democrats  -------------------------------------------- J R H Maij-Weggen, W G van Velzen, P A M Cornelissen, J Sonneveld, M G H M Oomen-Ruijten, K H M Peijs, J L Janssen van Raay, A M Oostlander, B Pronk, P L M Pex  -------------------------------------------- VVD  -------------------------------------------- G M de Vries, J G C Wiebenga, J E S Larive, J Mulder, F A Wijsenbeek, P C Ploij-van Corsel  -------------------------------------------- Green links  -------------------------------------------- Nel van Dijk  -------------------------------------------- D '66  -------------------------------------------- Jan-Willem Bertens, Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, Doeke Eisma, Johanna Boogerd-Quaak  -------------------------------------------- SGP  -------------------------------------------- L van der Waal, J Blokland  --------------------------------------------</p>

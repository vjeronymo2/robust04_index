Of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions,  the  general indexes of 14 provinces and municipalities, including  Beijing, were higher than 121 points. The growth rate of the  national general index was 10 percent, and those of Anhui and  other seven provinces and municipalities ranged from 30 to 11  percent, higher than the national level.    Development in the five major spheres of population,  economy,  health and medical care, social insurance, and public security  was in the lead. Development in three other major spheres,  namely science, technology, and education; environment; and  culture and sports was lagging behind.    A negative growth appeared in the development in the sphere  of labor, showing a marked imbalance.    The second issue of our magazine in 1992 carried a report  entitled "An Effective Move To Promote Social Progress" in which  the results of comprehensive appraisal of social development in  various localities of China was announced for the first time.  The report evoked nationwide concerns and strong repercussions.  Now one year has passed. What was the comprehensive level of  China's social development in 1992? Had it increased or  decreased? Was the development in the 10 major spheres of  social life balanced or imbalanced? With these questions in  mind, this reporter visited the Social Department of the State  Statistical Bureau some days ago and learned that the results of  comprehensive appraisal of social development of various  localities in 1992 had already come out and there were many new  and fresh changes.    Wu Jun, director of the Social Department of the State  Statistical Bureau, told this reporter that in 1992 the trend of  healthy development continued in the general level of China's  social development. According to more than 130 indexes in the  10 major spheres -- environment, population, economy, residents'  life, labor, social insurance, health and medical care, science  and technology and education, culture and sports, and public  security, the general index of the comprehensive level of social  development in 1992 was 121 points, which was 10 percent higher  than that of 1991, or 11 points higher. This fact shows that  China's social progress was not divorced from the high-rate  economic growth. This is indeed a gratifying fact.  <H3>  Order of General Indexes of 14 Provinces and Municipalities  in the Lead Has Changed </H3>   The 14 localities whose general indexes were higher than 121  points, the national average, were: Beijing (189), Shanghai  (179), Tianjin (170), Liaoning (156), Jilin (148), Guangdong  (142), Jiangsu (140), Heilongjiang (136), Zhejiang (134),  Shandong (133), Fujian (129), Hainan (125), Hebei (122), and  Shanxi (122).    Those whose general indexes were similar to the national  average were: Inner Mongolia (121) and Xinjiang (120).    The general indexes of the other 13 provinces and autonomous  regions, except for Taiwan and Tibet, whose statistical figures  were insufficient for the calculation, were lower than the  national average.    Compared with the results of the 1991 appraisal, the order  of  provinces and municipalities whose general indexes were higher  than the national average also changed. Of them, Jilin rose  from sixth to fifth place, Guangdong rose from seventh to sixth,  Heilongjiang rose from 10th to eighth, Fujian rose from 12th to  11th, and Shanxi rose from 14th to 13th, while Jiangsu dropped  from fifth to seventh, Shandong from eighth to 10th, and Hainan  from 11th to 12th.    Zhejiang and Hebei remained in their original places, ninth  and 13th. The changes show that there has been a trend of each  trying to overtake the other in striving for social progress,  economic growth, and harmonious development of the locality,  just like "the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing  his or her special powers."  <H3>  Anhui, Qinghai, and Guizhou Have Roused Themselves To Catch  Up </H3>   Most of the 14 provinces and municipalities whose general  indexes were higher than the national average are in the eastern  regions, especially the coastal areas. Benefiting from their  faster pace of reform and opening up and from their superior  economic and geographical positions, as well as their historical  and human resources, they are making great efforts to promote  comprehensive social progress in their respective localities  with the help of the high-rate economic growth.    What attracts people's attention is that in 1992 the  nation's  general index of social development increased by 10 percentage  points and those of eight provinces and regions were higher than  this. Most of them were localities lagging behind in 1991. Of  them, the general index of Anhui grew 30 percent, those of  Guizhou and Qinghai grew 23 percent, that of Inner Mongolia grew  15 percent, those of Gansu and Ningxia grew 14 percent, that of  Hubei grew 12 percent, and those of Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Hunan,  Zhejiang, and Shaanxi rose 11 percent.    Compared with the figures published in 1991, we can see that  the general indexes of Anhui, Guizhou, Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia,  and Jiangxi were all among the last 20 in the previous year. It  is indeed great news that these localities have been promoting  social progress at a rate much higher than the national average.  The development rates of Anhui, Guizhou, and Qinghai are  particularly outstanding. The three provinces can be called the  three "dark horses" in China's social development in 1992.  <H3>  Development in the Five Major Spheres of Population,  Economy, Health and Medical Care, Social Insurance, and Public  Security Was in the Lead </H3>   According to the figures promulgated by the State Statistics  Bureau, the level of development in the 10 major spheres of  social life in China were fairly high in 1992. The respective  indexes for the 10 major spheres are as follows: Environment  (12); population (13); economy (17); residents' life (13); labor  (12); social insurance (11); health and medical care (11);  science, technology, and education (13); culture and sports  (10); and public security (11).    Compared with the figures of 1991, the development in five  major spheres was more attractive in 1992, with indexes growing  by more than 10 percent:    The growth rate of the population index (comprising 12  specific indexes including the birth rate and the average life  expectancy) reached 24 percent, showing a marked improvement in  various profiles of China's population quality.    The growth rate of the Central Committee index (comprising  17  specific indexes including the GNP and the social labor  productivity) was 20 percent, showing a high economic growth  rate for the year.    The growth rate of the index of health and medical care  (comprising 11 specific indexes including health expenses and  the rate of acute infectious diseases) was 15 percent,  reflecting a considerably big progress in China's health and  medical work in that year.    The growth rate of the index of social insurance (comprising  13 specific indexes including labor protection and welfare  expenses for workers and retired personnel on a per capita  basis) was 14 percent, showing an increase, rather than a  decrease, in China's social insurance level while developing the  economy.    The growth rate of public security index (comprising 14  specific indexes including the number of cases concerning public  security investigated and handled on a "per 10 thousand people"  basis) was 11 percent, reflecting progress in China's public  security situation.    In 1991, of the 10 major spheres, population, culture and  sports, and public security were not developing satisfactorily.  Through our efforts in the following year, development in the  spheres of population and public security was promoted, but the  development in the sphere of culture and sports was still  lagging.  <H3>  Development in Spheres of Science, Technology, Education and  Environment Was Unsatisfactory, Negative Growth Appeared in the  Sphere of Labor </H3>   In 1991 the development in the spheres of environment,  science and technology and education, economy, and residents'  life was in the lead. One year later, development in the  spheres of environment and science and technology and education  slowed down, but the spheres of economy and residents' life  continued to develop steadily. The growth rate of the index of  environment was 3 percent and that of the index of science,  technology, and education was only 1 percent, much lower than  the high growth rate of the economic index of the same year,  which was 20 percent. As environment, science and technology,  and education have an important bearing on the momentum for the  long-term economic and social development of a country, the  lagging in these spheres should arouse our serious attention.    Another striking contrast to the high economic growth was  the  index of the sphere of labor. It comprises 12 specific indexes  including the unemployment rate in cities and towns. In 1992,  the growth rate of this index was -5 percent. This shows that  some unexpected factors had appeared in the sphere of social  labor in China's towns and country, such as social employment  and safety in labor. At a time when the economic structure was  being changed, the industrial structure was being readjusted,  and the economy was developing at a high speed, the appearance  of such phenomena is understandable. But it should not be  neglected either.  <H3>  In the 10 Major Spheres, Beijing and Shanghai Were in the  Lead, and Gansu and Liaoning Were Unexpected Winners </H3>   Classified according to different categories and regions,  Beijing was first in the spheres of environment, residents'  life, labor, social insurance, and culture and sports. Shanghai  was the first in the spheres of economy, health and medical  care, and science, technology, and education. This is nothing  unexpected. The two municipalities achieved high scores in many  spheres in 1991 and were able to maintain the high scores in  1992. But Gansu and Liaoning were unexpected. The former was  the first in the sphere of public security while the latter the  first in the sphere of population.    If we make a comparison with 1991 figures, we find many  significant changes. Some localities rose in certain spheres and  dropped in others. For example, in the sphere of environment,  Jiangsu rose from sixth to second place, Tianjin rose from 16th  to third, Guangdong rose from 10th to fourth, and Zhejiang rose  from eighth to fifth. But Shandong dropped from the second  place to below 10th, Shanghai dropped from third to eighth,  Liaoning from fifth to ninth, and Jilin from fourth to sixth.  This shows that the positions of various localities in the 10  major spheres are changing and all can achieve greater progress  through their efforts. It is very difficult for the localities  whose general indexes are in the lead to take the lead in all  the 10 major spheres. It is also difficult for a locality to  maintain the leading position in a certain sphere year by year,  because many other localities are trying to catch up. After the  result of the comprehensive appraisal of social development was  promulgated, many provinces, municipalities, and autonomous  regions found their own weak links and increased input in these  links. They are doubling their efforts to strive for greater  progress. We can find such traces from the 1992 appraisal  report.    What merits our attention is that in some localities where  the economy has been growing continuously at a high rate, the  index of development in the sphere of public security is  lagging. This has something to do with the large floating  population in these areas and the insufficient input in this  field. The experience of other countries proves that population  flow is a big motive force for economic development. But while  providing labor for those localities and promoting economic  development there, the floating population has also brought  security problems with them. However, after the economy is well  developed, these localities will be able to increase input in  this field and social security will be maintained. This is  common knowledge.    Wu Jun, director of the Social Department of the State  Statistical Bureau, said: In the overall plan, the statistical  indexes used in the recent calculation, except for some minor  readjustments, are the same as those used in 1991, so that  people can easily make comparisons and find out changes. This  work will be continued, because a statistical plan can show its  value only through a period of practice. Moreover, time is the  only criterion for examining the plan, to see whether it is  realistic, effective, and correct.    The director continued: The general level of social  development in a locality is a result of the long-term  interaction of various factors, including historical, natural,  geographical, and realistic factors. It cannot be entirely  changed in a short period of time. Therefore, if the  comprehensive appraisal is used to obtain information for  comparison -- a self-comparison and comparison with others, it  is certainly useful. But if it is used to compare with one  another in position, it will lose its meaning, because there are  many incomparable factors in various localities. The more than  130 indexes for appraisal and the general plan are not entirely  perfect. They will be improved in the future. But they must  also be relatively stable. If they are changed willfully at any  time, they will lose their scientific value.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Table 1: General Indexes of

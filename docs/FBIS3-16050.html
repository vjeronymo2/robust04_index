(SNARK) -- Most resultive in  settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict may become the  initiatives stemming from Russia and Iran, told SNARK today  Larissa Allaverdyan, the head expert of Artsakh  (Nagorno-Karabakh) Commission in Armenian parliament. In her  opinion, these two states are not only participants of  peacemaking processes, but also bear responsibility in the  international-law aspect, in front of the world community, for  resolution of Karabakh problem.    Russia and Iran, told the expert, are historically the last  title-holders of Karabakh. Joint initiatives, should they stem  form Russia and Iran, would have been in the interests of all  world states, and not only of Transcaucasus population, said  Larissa Allaverdyan.</p>

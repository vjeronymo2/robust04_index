			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Fed raises key interest rates: Markets rally as US central bank moves to tighten monetary policy The US Federal Reserve yesterday signalled a decisive tightening of US monetary policy by raising two key short-term interest rates by half a point. The Fed increased its target for the federal funds rate from 3.75 per cent to 4.25 per cent. It also announced the first increase in the symbolically important discount rate in more than five years - from 3 per cent to 3.5 per cent. The central bank said the increase in rates was designed 'to maintain favourable trends in inflation and thereby sustain the economic expansion'. Leading commercial banks responded by announcing a half point increase in prime lending rates from 6.75 per cent to 7.25 per cent. The increase in prime rates will raise the cost of a wide range of loans to consumers and small businesses. After an anxious morning awaiting a decision from the Fed, Wall Street responded positively to the rate increases, which were at the top end of market expectations. Many analysts expected a half point increase in the discount rate but some thought the federal funds rate would be raised by only a quarter point. In late New York trading, bond prices were up nearly two points, pushing the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond down to 7.268 per cent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 49.11 up at 3,720.61. The dollar was firm against the D-Mark. Bond prices surged partly because the increase in rates was accompanied by an official statement that appeared to indicate that the Fed believes it is now close to achieving its goal of a 'neutral' monetary policy - aimed neither at expansion nor contraction. After three earlier quarter-point increases in short-term rates, yesterday's actions 'substantially remove the degree of monetary accommodation that prevailed throughout 1993,' the Fed said. In financial markets this was interpreted as meaning the Fed will not push short-term interest rates much higher for several months. By creating a 'breathing space' it may hope bond prices will stabilise. For practical purposes the increase in the federal funds rate was the most significant of yesterday's rate increases. This is the rate at which banks lend overnight to each other and acts as a floor for short-term rates throughout the economy. The discount rate is the notional rate at which the Fed lends to banks. But little lending actually occurs at this rate. Moves in the discount rate, however, have an important symbolic impact by underlining the Fed's determination to shift the stance of monetary policy. The Fed's five-strong board of governors voted unanimously for the discount rate increase, which had been requested by 11 of 12 regional Fed presidents. Ms Laura Tyson, the White House chief economist, said the administration neither endorsed nor criticised the Fed's action. It was the Fed's prerogative to take action to secure a 'sustained expansion with low inflation'. The main rationale for yesterday's rate increases was to slow the rate of economic growth and thus prevent an eventual increase in inflation if the economy hits capacity constraints. Rapid increases in employment since the beginning of the year have indicated that growth is running well above the economy's long-run potential rate of expansion. But the Fed rate increase was also seen by analysts as an attempt to help stabilise the dollar on foreign exchange markets.

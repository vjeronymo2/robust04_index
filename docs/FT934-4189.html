			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / How To Spend It: Inspired by trees of life Those seeking decorative inspiration should head to the Save the Children Fund's festival of trees which can be seen, free, at the headquarters of Coutts and Co., 440 The Strand, London WC2 until December 6. Several distinguished creative talents have lent their skills free and each has decorated a tree in the spirit of Christmas. The range of designs has always been vast, taking in post-modernist teases as well as reworkings of traditional themes. Simpson of Piccadilly, for instance, has provided a rampantly romantic tree - all pine-cones and floppy bows on a proper fir, while Sarah Faberge's version is hung with hand-painted eggs and crowned with an 18 carat gold and crystal egg pendant. For Coca-Cola, the sponsors, George Daniel created a futuristic tree - green perspex triangle converging on a stylised glove and hung with colourful crackers. On the evening of December 6 the trees are auctioned at a gala dinner with proceeds going to the Fund. The Richmond Fellowship Craft Fair, which many readers kindly support, is on this weekend, today and tomorrow at 8 Addison Road, London W14 in a splendid Edwardian house, built in 1906. It is a great chance to buy your presents and help a charity which provides care, rehabilitation, sheltered workschemes and support in the community for people with mental health or addiction problems. It is open from 11 am to 5 pm today and tomorrow, admission Pounds 2.50. Finally, for those Christmas shopping for far-flung relations who do not mind the shopping as but hate the parcelling-up, it is worth knowing about Mail &amp; Pack, which will gift-wrap, pack and send to any address within the UK or overseas. Prices start from Pounds 9.95 for the full service. Shoppers can either drop their parcels in themselves or organise for them to be collected from the shops. Mail &amp; Pack is at No. 35, Savile Row, London W1, tel: 071-287-3301.</p>

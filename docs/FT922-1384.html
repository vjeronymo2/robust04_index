			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle increases presence in Asia NESTLE, the Swiss food manufacturer, said yesterday it intended to pay HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for 51 per cent of the manufacturing assets in Hong Kong and southern China of Dairy Farm International, the Hong Kong-based international food retailer. Dairy Farm said it would sell a controlling stake in its wholly-owned Hong Kong dairy products manufacturer as well as control of its 70 per cent-owned Guangzhou (Canton) ice cream maker, Guangzhou Refrigerated Foods. The deal, which is expected to be concluded in October, marks Nestle's first move into food manufacture in the colony and increases its presence in mainland China. The Swiss company also plans to buy the Jardine Matheson-controlled Dairy Farm's brand names. The two companies said they would establish a joint venture company to make and distribute ice cream and chilled products, such as milk and yoghurt, in Hong Kong and China. Mr Chris Nelson, managing director of Dairy Farm, said the company had been looking for a partner for some time to help develop the possibilities for large-scale food manufacture now available in China. 'We have been getting so many approaches from other cities and provinces in China but we did not have the resources to meet the demands,' Mr Nelson added. The cash released to Dairy Farm by the sale will allow it to develop further its retailing operations in Hong Kong, Britain, Spain, Australasia, China and Taiwan. The deal also marks a further retreat by Dairy Farm from manufacturing to distribution and retailing. For Nestle, the deal adds a consumer food manufacturer to its other two main manufacturing interests in China. In Heilongjiang, in north-east China, it makes infant foods and full-cream milk powder; in Dongguan, south of Guangzhou, it has China's largest instant coffee manufacturing plant. Mr K. F. Lim, Nestle's chief in Hong Kong, said the purchase of Dairy Farm's assets strengthened the company's position in Hong Kong. The turnover of its two businesses in China was greater than Dairy Farm's in China, he added. Mr Lim said the potential of the Chinese market was great. Although it was false to look at it in terms of China's population of 1.2bn people, in the coastal provinces of the country there were between 300m and 400m people with money and the relative freedom of choice. 'When an economy reaches a certain stage as has China's, people can afford the luxury of choice,' he said. 'It is then that products such as ice cream come into their own. We believe there is considerable room for growth in China.'</p>

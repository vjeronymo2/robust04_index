			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / TUC official raps profit-related pay as 'tax dodge' Profit-related pay schemes are an unfair tax dodge for employers, a Trades Union Congress official said yesterday. Mr Bill Callaghan, head of the TUC's Economic and Social Affairs Department, said that the TUC would be calling for an end to profit-related pay. 'I don't think the rest of us should be subsidising companies in that way.' The TUC said such schemes would cost the taxpayer about Pounds 500m this year. Union leaders are suspicious that profit-related pay schemes approved by the Inland Revenue, which involve payments of a tax-free bonus which is not consolidated into incremental earnings, may be used as a method of getting away from annual pay bargaining. Mr Callaghan told a London conference on employee financial participation that such schemes were no substitute for industrial democracy. He said: 'If workers are to share some of the entrepreneurial risks of a business then they should have the opportunity to influence strategic decisions.' A report on employee financial participation in companies, published by the Confederation of British Industry, the employers' organisation, and Cable and Wireless, the telecommunications group, showed a big growth in profit-sharing schemes in the past four years. The report found that almost two-thirds of nearly 300 organisations questioned were operating some form of financial participation scheme. Executive share options were the most popular form of schemes approved by the Inland Revenue used by 37 per cent of the companies, while 29 per cent operated save-as-you-earn schemes and 28 per cent used profit-related pay. Nearly a fifth said they used such schemes to replace some existing pay and 12 per cent said they used them in place of a future pay increase.</p>

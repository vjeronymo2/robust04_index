			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Elections in Iran A senior Iranian official yesterday predicted that a sweeping victory in parliamentary elections for supporters of Iran's President Hashemi Rafsanjani would strengthen economic liberalisation in Iran, Tony Walker reports from Tehran. Mr Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, told the Financial Times that 'getting a majority in the parliament'would help Mr Rafsanjani implement his reforms. He was speaking as final results in elections for Iran's 270-member parliament were announced. The results confirmed earlier reports of a landslide victory for Mr Rafsanjani's supporters throughout the country, and a rout of his radical opponents. Mr Velayati said Iran's president would now press ahead with completing the country's 1989-94 five-year economic development plan which placed particular emphasis on reconstruction following the eight-year war with Iran. Mr Rafsanjani, president since July 1989, encountered resistance to his reformist policies from the old parliament which was dominated by radicals elected in 1988 while Ayatollah Khomeini was still alive. According to Tehran Radio, 268 of the 270 parliamentary seats have been finalised. Voting in two electorates had been declared null and void. Rafsanjani supporters appear to have made their strongest showing in Tehran.</p>

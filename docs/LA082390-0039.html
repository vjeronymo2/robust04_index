			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLATFORM;  </P> <P> KIDS NEED SUMMER  </P> <P> I don't think it's a good idea to require students to attend public school in  the summer. We like to take vacations in the summer and we won't able to take  trips if my son has to attend school year round.  </P> <P> The time off gives students a chance to rest and come back to school fresh and  ready to learn.  </P> <P> This change will also be costly for some because many parents have depended on  their older children to baby-sit the younger children in the household in the  summer months.  </P> <P> The school board says they need year-round school because they're in a  financial pinch. But the district is top-heavy. Why haven't they considered  cutting the pay (of administrators)?  </P> <P> I wonder if the school board has considered the conditions of the classrooms in  the summer. It's very hot and some students have difficulty concentrating in  the heat. On the other hand, summer trips can be very educational. Last summer,  we went to Washington, D.C., which was very educational experience for my son.  </P></p>

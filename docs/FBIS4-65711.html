			<p>BFN     [Text] Copenhagen, May 20 (AFP) -- Bulgarian Foreign  Minister Stanislav Daskalov called Friday [20 May] for a  resolution of the Greek-Macedonian [The Former Yugoslav Republic  of Macedonia -- FYROM] conflict and said that Greek sanctions  against its neighbour could affect the region's stability.    "This situation is very regrettable because these sanctions  are also affecting Bulgaria," Daskalov said during a one-day  official visit here. "This conflict must be resolved on the  negotiating table rather than through an embargo."    Greece has refused landlocked Macedonia access to its  northern port of Salonika since mid-February in a dispute over  names.    Athens accuses Skopje of having designs on the northern  Greek  province of Macedonia and of usurping Greek symbols on its flag.    Daskalov on Friday also said that his country was paying a  heavy price as a result of the UN trade embargo against the  rump-Yugoslavia -- Serbia and Montenegro -- for the Serbs' role  in the wars in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.</p>

			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Tough challenge for Quebec's separatist leaders QUEBEC'S separatist leaders were jubilant yesterday at the resounding No vote delivered in Monday's constitutional referendum, claiming the next referendum in the mostly French-speaking province would be on creating a new country. Mr Jacques Parizeau, head of the separatist Parti Quebecois, said the only options were separation of the province from the rest of Canada or a massively revised federal arrangement. 'This time we said what we didn't want, the next time we will say what we want,' Mr Parizeau told cheering crowds on Monday night. 'Quebecois are a people, they are a nation, and very soon they will be a country.' Monday's vote will strengthen the party's hand, analysts say, but its leadership still faces a tremendous challenge in converting this to votes in the next provincial election, which must take place by 1994 although it could come earlier. Mr Robert Bourassa, the province's Liberal prime minister, must now try to tailor his message to gain the support of those who voted to reject the constitutional package, which he supported. At a rally late on Monday, Mr Bourassa defended the idea of keeping Quebec in the confederation with the rest of Canada. 'We believe we will be able to build Quebec within Canada. That is the policy of the Liberal party,' he said. 'I am convinced we will continue to advance the cause of Quebec.' Mr Bourassa, who boycotted any negotiations with the federal government and the English-speaking provinces for about two years, put much of his popularity and support on the line by returning to the bargaining table. However, rejection of the Charlottetown Accord does not mean most francophone Quebecois have abandoned hope for rejoining the Canadian federation. They clearly want a better deal and one that provides them with far more autonomy and more security as a French-speaking society. Hard-core separatists in Quebec, the polls consistently show, represent not much more than 20 per cent of the population. And although many voters snubbed an accord they regarded as being dictated by the nine English-speaking provinces, they were also expressing their dissatisfaction with the federal government's economic policies. Quebec has a 12 per cent unemployment rate and Montreal, particularly, has been hard hit by industrial restructuring. The province is 80 per cent French speaking and the No side prevailed in almost all the francophone ridings and in Montreal, which represents nearly half the total population of 6.5m. Only the primarily English-speaking ridings in the western sector of Montreal delivered a majority for the Yes camp.</p>

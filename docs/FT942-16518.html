			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Surge in sales of new vehicles underpins strength of recovery A larger-than-expected surge in sales in virtually all sectors of the new vehicle market should underpin hopes that the recovery is still on course. Figures released yesterday by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that new-car registrations were up by 14.8 per cent in March on a year-on-year basis. New registrations in the commercial vehicle sector leapt by 28 per cent. The scale of the improvement in the commercial vehicle market may silence some sceptics in the motor industry who have maintained that the strength of the recovery is being over-stated. They fear a false impression was being created by marketing techniques to attract reluctant private buyers, and by some manufacturers encouraging dealers to register many cars for which there were no final buyers. Commercial vehicle sales are made for purely business reasons, and are a good market indicator. Sales of vans, trucks and buses increased last month to 22,648 compared with 17,741 at the same time last year. The increase, the third consecutive month of rises, brings commercial registrations for the first quarter to 56,602, 12.65 per cent up on the first quarter last year. Sales of new cars last month rose to 185,201, compared with 161,338 in the same month last year. They lifted registrations for the first quarter of the year to 529,436 from 453,261 at the same time last year. This represents a 16.81 per cent rise for the quarter, and seems to indicate that the car market slowed in March. However, January was an artificially good month with its year-on-year rise of 20 per cent after poor sales the previous January. Mr Ernie Thompson, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'These figures clearly indicate that the recovery is being maintained despite the widespread knowledge of pending tax increases and changes in company car tax benefit assessment.' The new tax regime for company cars, based on a percentage of list prices, came into effect on April 6. Yesterday's figures suggest the society's forecast of 1.9m new-car sales this year, compared with 1.78m in 1993, may be pessimistic. The share of last month's car market taken by imports rose to 57.9 per cent from 55 per cent in March last year. Vehicle sales table, Page 5</p>

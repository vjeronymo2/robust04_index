			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Poland/Italy: President Walesa in </F> Rome"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 18 -- Polish President Lech Walesa  arrived in Rome today with a large delegation of Warsaw  government representatives to a welcome led by Polish Premier  Waldemar Pawlak, who came to this capital yesterday.    Following Walesa's arrival, aboard a Polish Air Force flight  which landed at the Ciampino military and civilian airport, the  full delegation departed for Cassino, midway between Rome and  Naples, for a ceremony marking the 50th anniversary of the World  War II battle of Montecassino.    In fierce fighting during the offensive mounted against a  German stronghold by Allied troops, including the II Polish Army  Corps, more than 2,000 Polish soldiers were killed. Cassino is  also the site of Italy's largest Polish cemetery.    This evening, the visiting president will return to Rome for  a meeting with Head of State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Tomorrow,  Walesa will go to Rome's Catholic Gemelli Hospital for a visit  to his friend and compatriot, Pope John Paul II, who is  recovering from surgery following a broken leg. The president  will return to Warsaw tomorrow in the early afternoon.</p>

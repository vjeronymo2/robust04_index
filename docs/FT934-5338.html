			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: Turkey cancels paper group sale Plans to sell part of the Turkish state paper company were cancelled yesterday along with a rescheduling of the sale of the state aircraft tyre factory. The developments deal a severe blow to Turkey's privatisation programme. Turkiye Seluloz ve Kagit Fabrikalari (Seka), the state-owned paper and pulp group, confirmed that it had not received any bids for its Balikesir factory, which the company had put up for sale in September at a minimum price of Dollars 250m. Seka is Turkey's largest producer of newsprint. The company, which is arranging its own privatisation, is now expected to approach the main newspaper groups Sabah and Hurriyet to seek a buyer. Separately, the tender for the government's 99 per cent stake in Petlas, the tyre manufacturer, which was due to close yesterday has been extended to December 14, in order to give the government agency in charge of state assets sales more time to attract buyers. The agency had set a minimum price of around Dollars 100m. Petlas was formed in the 1970s in the wake of the US arms embargo on Turkey, following the invasion of Cyprus in 1974. It makes tyres for aircraft and military land vehicles.</p>

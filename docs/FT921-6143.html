			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Company News: JC Penney reports steep decline in final quarter JC PENNEY, the Dallas-based retail group, yesterday reported a sharp drop in after-tax profits during the final three months of 1991-92. It saw earnings fall from Dollars 206m to Dollars 37m. However, the figure was scored after sizeable non-recurring items, which Penney had already announced would have an impact on results in the three months to January 25. Ahead of these charges, the company's profits rose from Dollars 206m to Dollars 301m. This improvement at first cheered the market and Penney's shares gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 64. But, by close of trade, the shares were off Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 62 7/8 . Sales during the final quarter improved by 2.2 per cent to Dollars 5.4bn. For the year overall, Penney saw sales fall 1 per cent, to Dollars 16.2bn, and net profits - after the Dollars 695m pre-tax charge - of Dollars 80m. The previous year's figure was Dollars 577m. Meanwhile, Woolworth - like Penney - also saw final-quarter figures marred by restructuring charges. It reported a net loss for the 13 weeks to January 25 of Dollars 128m, against net profits of Dollars 149m for the same period a year earlier. The restructuring charge totalled Dollars 250m at the net level. Woolworth had warned of the charge, but the shares still eased Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 28 1/2 at close of trade. Woolworth's sales for the final quarter rose from Dollars 3.06bn to Dollars 3.14bn, while sales for the year were Dollars 9.92bn against Dollars 9.79bn. The annual net loss, after the charges, was Dollars 166m, against a Dollars 317m profit in 1990-91.</p>

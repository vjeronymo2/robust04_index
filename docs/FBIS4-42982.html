			<p>BFN     [Text] Mulhouse (DPA) -- Germany and France will take over  the presidency in the European Union (EU), which both countries  will hold one after the other for almost a year as of 1 July,  with a well coordinated work program. This was stressed by  Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand  at the conclusion of their 63d summit in Mulhouse, Alsace, on  Tuesday [31 May].    Both men emphasized that the EU must not become an "elevated  free trade zone" because of enlargement. "This was not the  intention of the founders. This is not our intention,"  Mitterrand said. "For me enlargement and deepening is no  contradiction," Kohl stressed.    The chancellor stated that Mitterrand's announcement that he  will invite the Eurocorps and those politically responsible in  the participating countries for the military parade on 14 July,  the French National Day, is a "wonderful gesture."</p>

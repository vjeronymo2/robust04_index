			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] As reported, the leader of the Republican Party of  the Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, has become the first president of the  Crimean Republic. Presidential ex-candidate Mykola Bagrov,  satisfying journalists' request, held a news conference today.  He explained his defeat at yesterday's balloting saying that  the people voted not against him but against their difficult  situation [as heard]. Mykola Bagrov did not agree with the  opinion that he was preparing the presidential office for  himself. [passage indistinct] I have not interfered with the  results of the balloting, and this was confirmed by Yuriy  Meshkov's impressive victory. Mykola Bagrov was sorry that  Crimean residents did not support his program, on which he had  worked so hard. Asked about how realistic Yuriy Meshkov's  program is, Mykola Bagrov said that the first Crimean president  will face many difficulties. If Yuriy Meshkov appeals to him  for help, he -- guided by Crimean interests -- will not refuse  to give it. With regard to his personal plans for the future,  Mykola Bagrov did not specify them, but said that he was going  to leave politics. At any rate, he will not participate in the  elections to the Crimean or Ukrainian Supreme Council. A hard  life is in store for me, he said at the end, but I am not going  to part with the Crimea.</p>

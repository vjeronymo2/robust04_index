			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on telephone interview with Refat Chubarov, deputy </F> chairman of the Majlis of the Crimean Tartars, by Mykola  Marynenko; Chubarov in Simferopol, date not given -- recorded;  Chubarov in Russian fading into Ukrainian translation]    [Text] [Chubarov] The thing is that our attitude toward  all kinds of referendums in Crimea, by which influential forces  are trying to determine its status, was and remains negative.  We are against such actions because these are attempts to  decide on Crimea's future without taking into account the will  of the indigenous population of the peninsula, the Crimean  Tatars. Therefore, any intentions by influential forces to do  this by purely arithmetical voting will never satisfy the Tatars.    [Marynenko] During the telephone conversation with the  deputy  chairman of the Majlis I also recalled the following: When they  asked Meshkov about his relations with the Crimean Tatars in  general and the Majlis in particular, he answered that he had  good contacts with the Crimean Tatars. Many of them supported  him at the presidential election. As far as the Majlis is  concerned, in Meshkov's opinion, there is some misunderstanding  with its leaders only. I asked Mr. Chubarov to comment on these  facts.    [Chubarov] This statement is on president Meshkov's  conscience because it does not correspond to reality, at least  judging by the results of the voting of the Crimean Tatars. In  particular, during the first round we analyzed the voting at  those polling stations where half or even more electors were  Crimean Tatars. At these polling stations Bahrov, as a rule,  was running first, other deputies lagging behind. So, I do not  trust Yuriy Meshkov's statements of such kind.    As far as the Majlis of the Crimean Tatar people is  concerned, president Meshkov has a good idea of the status of  the Majlis. He has more than once declared that the Majlis of  the Crimean Tatar people is a real force. The majority of the  Crimean Tatars support the Majlis and one cannot ignore this  fact.    [Marynenko] My last question to Refat Chubarov dealt with  the March election in the autonomy both to the parliament of  Ukraine and to the Supreme Council of the autonomous Crimea  Republic. I asked him what was the attitude of the Majlis  toward these elections and the participation of the Crimean  Tatars in them. Here is the reply by the deputy chairman of the  Majlis, Mr. Chubarov.    [Chubarov] By the way, unlike... [pauses] This is probably  the only advantage of the Crimean election law. The only  difference between our law on the election to the Crimean  parliament and the law of Ukraine on the election to the Supreme  Council of Ukraine lies in the fact that here in Crimea a mixed  election system was adopted. We have 66 one-seat  constituencies. We have 14 deputy seats in a multi-seat party  constituency and 14 deputy seats in a multi-seat Crimean-Tatar  constituency.    The Crimean Tatars will take part in these elections. The  Kurultay [congress] of the Crimean Tatar people approved a list  of 25 candidates for deputies in a multi-seat Crimean-Tatar  constituency. Altogether four such lists were approved. These  are the lists of the Kurultay of the Crimean Tatar people, the  Crimean- Tatar Culture Fund, the National Movement of the  Crimean Tatars, and the lists of the Culture Center. It is  noteworthy that the list of the Kurultay and the list of the  Crimean-Tatar Culture Fund include like-minded people. The  National Movement of the Crimean Tatars and the Crimean Tatar  Culture Center also nominated like-minded people, but on the  other side. That is to say, a polarization of forces is under  way and the results of the election will, probably, round off  all the talk on how many Crimean Tatars support the Majlis or,  for example, the National Movement of the Crimean Tatars.</p>

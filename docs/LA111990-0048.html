Women studied  ranged between 30 and 69 in 1971. Julius tracked their mortality rates through  1989. To determine the levels of their anger and how they showed it, Julius  asked the study participants to describe how angry they would feel if their  spouses yelled at them for something they did not do or if a policeman did the  same thing.  </P></p>

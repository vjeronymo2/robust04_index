			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / World Trade News: EC prods Tokyo over competition MR Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, yesterday called on Japan to translate recent declarations on strengthening competition policy into 'concrete and effective action.' Speaking at a Japan-EC competition seminar in Tokyo - the first of its kind  -Mr Van Miert said competition policy should be used to 'open up the Japanese market to fair and undistorted competition from abroad.' According to the text of his speech, released in Brussels, Mr Van Miert said the Japanese government's ambitious policy declarations would have 'no value' unless they were backed up by action. He said the Japanese authorities had to take into account foreign as well as domestic companies when framing competition policy. Like his predecessor Sir Leon Brittan, Mr Van Miert picked out Japan's restrictive distribution system as one potential barrier to competition from non-Japanese companies. Mr Van Miert welcomed the 1991 guidelines on opening up the system, issued by the country's monopolies watchdog, the Fair Trade Commission. But he said they still fell short of the EC's competition rules. He also welcomed the FTC's 'increased vigour' over the last few years, but called on the Japanese government to provide additional backing for the watchdog, by increasing the scope of the country's anti-monopoly law. The competition seminar aims to bring together European and Japanese competition authorities, lawyers, academics and consumer representatives to examine and compare anti-trust policies. EC commissioners yesterday approved plans to streamline anti-dumping, anti-subsidy and safeguard inquiries. The proposals - to set deadlines, give consumers a greater say in cases and separate dumping and injury investigations - will now be put to EC ministers. Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, said the proposals would 'shorten the period of doubt and uncertainty that can seriously hamper the business plans of firms under investigation.'</p>

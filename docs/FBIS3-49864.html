			<p>Language: <F P=105> Albanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Democratic Alliance General Secretary Arben </F> Imami by Erion Brace in Tirana on 15 January: "Imami Declares:  This Is a Typically Fascist Murder"]    [Text] Yesterday two Albanian newspapers, ZERI I POPULLIT  and KOHA JONE, reported the murder at about 1500 of the  26-year-old Gjovalin Cekini in the city of Shkoder. In its  report, KOHA JONE reported Mr. Imami's view that "The Alliance  paid in blood for a peaceful meeting." According to Mr. Imami,  Cjovalin Cekimi was a member of the Democratic Alliance [AD],  and a participant at the meeting.    In connection with this shocking incident, I turned to Mr.  Arben Imami, AD general secretary.    [Brace] The spokesman of the Public Order Ministry late last  night, and today's newspapers, reported a murder in the city of  Shkoder yesterday. Because there is little information in the  newspapers and the Public Order Ministry's report, please add  something.    [Imami] The Public Order Ministry's report is strange,  because the background of the incident and its aim and purpose  were political. The Public Order Ministry does not normally  report the dozens of murders that take place in Albania, but  this time it did, saying that this was an ordinary murder with  nothing to do with the political background I am talking about.  In brief, the chronological course of events was as follows:  While we were holding our meeting, about 2030 members of the  Democratic Party [PD] who work in the local PD presidium  entered. Not receiving the support with which they intended to  break up the meeting, they stood up following an order and  demonstratively left the hall, shouting the basest insults and  slanders. Our people were aroused, and an incident could have  occurred. Aware of this, together with Mr. Gjerjgj Zefi, the  assembly's deputy chairman, we called on our party's members and  supporters not to fall for this provocation. We continued the  meeting in an entirely normal fashion for another 30 minutes.  When the people left the hall, and obviously those who had  remained behind were AD members and supporters, the murder  occurred. According to eyewitness descriptions, a car arrived  and stopped in front of the Migjeni Theater. Its engine was  left running, and someone got out to meet someone else in a  Toyota with an official license-plate. At this moment, the  people from the hall arrived, and this person turned to the  participant in the meeting, saying "Whoever insults Sali Berisha  is a so-and-so, and does such-and- such." A minor conflict then  followed; the person in question had the revolver he used for  the attack constantly drawn. Other people tried to hold him  back, stop him, and calm him, and then he committed his crime  against a member of our party [words illegible] were together  and included the one who commuted the crime, and whose names are  known although one must wait for the ministry to issue them, at  least one can already be said, here in Tirana without going to  Shkoder to check, to be one of the main protagonists of the  provocation inside the meeting hall.    The plan was very clear. They entered the meeting to disrupt  it, failed in this, went outside, organized themselves, decided  to do something, came with the car, left the car engine running,  and commuted the crime, while the car drove off and the murderer  escaped on foot. The criminals have still not been detained,  although, as the police say, they have been identified.    To my mind, this is a murder, a second 2 April. The PD,  which was the party that fought against violence and for freedom  and democracy, is the party that today organizes all the  counter- rallies, mounts provocations, and is creating an  atmosphere of political crime. We have felt that political  crimes were impending. I have even asked in the parliament, "Why  do you not play the game politically, but play with life and  death?" However, we will accept this game, and are ready to  reply with our lives. The PD, having been the party of the  struggle against crime, has become a party that organizes crime  at all levels. The corruption that has enveloped the entire PD  will naturally result in crime.    Berisha too has particular responsibility, starting from  the earlier incident when he asked what the Socialists wanted in  Shkoder. One could say the same of anybody: What does the AD  want in Shkoder? What do the Republicans want in Shkoder? --  as if Shkoder belonged only to the PD or to Sali Berisha.  Meanwhile, strong feeling against Sali Berisha has arisen in  Shkoder. We will exploit this mood against him. For the  television and ATA, which daily issue statements calling the  people of our party spies and mercenary dogs, and for a party  fanatic who is also corrupt, the idea of defending certain  values and murder [passage illegible] is clearly prepared and  wound up morally, psychologically, and politically.    [Brace] Mr. Imami, why this time against the AD?    [Imami] We must realize that Shkoder is a citadel of  democracy. Shkoder is a city of anticommunism, a city of  freedom. Shkoder is a city of serious religious belief (I am not  talking here about religious intolerance). Shkoder after all is  a city, and the PD wanted to preserve its monopoly at least in  Shkoder. It has no doubt conclusively lost its monopoly in  Albania, but it wanted to at least preserve its monopoly in  Shkoder, and our meeting there, with its substance, support, and  splendid level of participation, no doubt touched its nerve.  However, I will say one thing that we must remember. One of  the murderers, one of the group, was a person who expects to  gain something from privatization, at a time when we are  speaking out against this privatization, which is a form of  theft. Thus, the general political interests of this party  coincide with the specific economic interests of corrupt  individuals. Thus there is a combination of general and  personal interests that leads to crime.    [Brace] What will you do now?    [Imami] It is a little early to talk about further action;  we must not behave overhastily. We have a political  responsibility because this person was one of our people and we  stand by him. We did not succeed in protecting him against this  fascist state while he was alive. This murder is typically  fascist, because only fascists murder political activists and  disrupt political demonstrations by such means. To come back to  the question, I say that the party will defend this issue to the  end, and we will explain calmly and without haste the means that  we will employ. We will issue a statement at a news conference  tomorrow. We will send a memorandum to European institutions.  We will call on the members of our party not to retreat a  single step in this issue and will plan our political action to  the last detail: no retreat toward a restriction of freedom,  toward a restriction of rights, no retreat when faced with this  state of violence and organized crime.</p>

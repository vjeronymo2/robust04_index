			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME JAPANESE GOODS MAY GET 100% TARIFFS  </P> <P> The White House on Wednesday published a list of more than 50 Japanese products  that might be candidates for 100% tariffs later this year if the United States  retaliates against Japan for failing to comply with a longstanding pact on  trade in telecommunications equipment.  </P> <P> The list includes some $900 million worth of Japanese telecommunications  products and $600 million worth of other Japanese-made goods, ranging from  facsimile machines and cordless telephones to laser beams and specialized  semiconductors.  </P> <P> The early notice, to be published in today's Federal Register, is designed to  warn Japan of the kinds of products that U.S. officials will consider when they  make up the final list of items to be selected for retaliatory tariffs or other  restrictions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sanctions Aren't Certain  </P> <P> U.S. officials published a similar lengthy list of potential candidates for  retaliation before imposing sanctions on Japan in 1987 for Japan's alleged  violation of a previous year's accord on trade in semiconductors. The actual  sanctions then amounted only to $300 million.  </P> <P> Trade officials said Wednesday that they had not yet estimated how much  business U.S. exporters may have lost as a result of Japan's failure to comply  with the pact on telecommunications equipment -- the figure on which the White  House traditionally bases the size of any sanctions.  </P> <P> However, the U.S. Trade Representative's Office has scheduled a formal hearing  on the issue for May 24. Officials conceded that the total is likely to be well  below the $1.5 billion worth of products contained in Wednesday's lists.  </P> <P> It still is not certain that the Administration will impose such sanctions. The  U.S. Trade Representative's Office announced Friday that it had decided to cite  Japan formally for failure to live up to the telecommunications accord -- a  step required under the 1988 Trade Act.  </P> <P> But Japan still has up to six months to meet U.S. demands that it come into  compliance with the agreement, and its trade officials are expected to launch  negotiations soon to try to settle the issue before sanctions are imposed.  </P> <P> The U.S. charges of violations affect two specific products -- U.S.-made  cellular telephones and mobile car radios. In both cases, Washington alleges  that Tokyo has restricted their use by refusing to license radio operations and  allocate frequencies that the products could use in some sections of Japan.  </P> <P> Both products are major exports of Motorola Inc. of Schaumburg, Ill., which  raised the issue initially that led to negotiation of the original  telecommunications accord. Motorola officials have maintained that the  restrictions bar them from the country's most lucrative markets.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said that, just as in the case involving trade in semiconductors  a few years ago, they must be careful to choose products for retaliation whose  restriction will not hurt American producers.  </P> <P> For example, imposing high tariffs on Japanese-made laser products could impose  a hardship on U.S. manufacturers of machine tools and medical equipment. The  hearing scheduled for May 24 is intended to uncover some of those potential  problems.  </P> <P> In a separate action Wednesday, the trade representative's office announced  that it had worked out an agreement with the European Community on an interim  procedure for allowing some U.S.-produced beef into European markets, despite  the EC's ban on growth hormones.  </P> <P> The procedure provides for allowing U.S. producers who want to export  hormone-free beef to Europe to sign a private contract with European officials  under which they agree to meet European requirements. In return, the EC will  arrange to monitor those cattle.  </P> <P> But U.S. officials cautioned that the accord will affect only a minuscule part  of potential U.S. beef exports to Europe and will not resolve the larger  dispute over whether the European ban on hormone-treated beef is justified.  </P> <P> As a result, Washington is maintaining the 100% tariffs, or extra duties, that  the Administration imposed Jan. 1 on some $96 million in European meat  shipments to the United States. The two sides also agreed to continue their  negotiations indefinitely.  </P> <P> Besides the facsimile machines and cordless telephones, the list of potential  candidates for retaliation in the Japanese telecommunications case included  automatic data-processing machines, optical readers and chemicals such as  aluminum nitride and silicides.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Phone Fees Possible  </P> <P> Also listed were industrial robots, carpet sweepers, ultrasonic welding  machines, die-bonding assembling equipment, telephone switching equipment,  microphones and loudspeakers, tape recorders, paging devices, radar detectors,  burglar alarm parts, diodes, photovoltaic cells, wire, cable, station wagons,  helicopters, propellers and rotors, optical fibers, photocopiers, oscilloscopes  and microprocessors.  </P> <P> The list also raises the possibility of imposing fees on telecommunications  services such as general telephone transmission services, submarine cable  facilities, private radio services and electronic mail, code and voice mail.  </P> <P> TARGETS OF POSSIBLE RETALIATION  </P> <P> Beauty or makeup preparations  </P> <P> Sunscreen or suntan lotion  </P> <P> Manicure or pedicure lotions  </P> <P> Porcelain or china ceramics  </P> <P> Digital automatic data-processing machines  </P> <P> Magnetic or optical readers  </P> <P> Input or output units  </P> <P> Machines and mechanical appliances  </P> <P> Carpet sweepers  </P> <P> Machines for production of diodes, transistors and semiconductors  </P> <P> Electron-beam lithography apparatus  </P> <P> Laser or photon beam, ultrasonic, magnetic pulse or plasma-arc soldering,  brazing or welding machines and apparatus  </P> <P> Electric machines for hot spraying metals  </P> <P> Die bonding assembly equipment for integrated circuits  </P> <P> Telephone sets  </P> <P> Telephone switching apparatus  </P> <P> Microphones and stands  </P> <P> Loudspeakers  </P> <P> Headphones  </P> <P> Earphones  </P> <P> Amplifiers  </P> <P> Magnetic tape recorders  </P> <P> Telephone answering machines  </P> <P> Television or radio broadcasting equipment  </P> <P> Citizens band radios  </P> <P> Television and radio receivers  </P> <P> Antennas and parts  </P> <P> Sirens, indicator panels  </P> <P> Burglar or fire alarms  </P> <P> Radar detectors  </P> <P> Photovoltaic cells, diodes, transistors and other semiconductors  </P> <P> Insulated wire, cable and other conductors  </P> <P> Cars, station wagons and racing cars  </P> <P> Golf carts and snowmobiles  </P> <P> Minivans  </P> <P> Off-road vehicles  </P> <P> Helicopters, spacecraft  </P> <P> Communications satellites parts  </P> <P> Optical fibers and cables  </P> <P> Lenses, prisms and mirrors  </P> <P> Photocopiers  </P> <P> Cinematographic photography equipment  </P> <P> Parts for splicers, titlers  </P> <P> Oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers and other instruments  </P> <P> Microprocessors for compueter workstations and VCRs  </P> <P> Common carrier telecommunications services  </P> <P> Submarine cable facilities  </P> <P> Private radio service  </P> <P> Electronic mail, code and voice mail  </P> <P> Hydrides, nitrides, azides, silicides and borides  </P> <P> Aluminum nitride  </P></p>

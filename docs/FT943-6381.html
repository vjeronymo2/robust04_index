			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Inflation forces hand of Chinese leaders Chinese leaders may not have panicked over recent bad economic news but they have certainly reacted vigorously to indications that a 12-month-old programme aimed at curbing an overheating economy was faltering. Since last week they have re-asserted price controls and announced that failing state-owned enterprises would be bailed out. Less emphasis is being placed in government statements on reform than on stabilising an economy which is proving resistant to attempts to rein it in. The question for western economists and for business is whether a price freeze accompanied by 'welfare' payments to state industry marks a backing away from economic liberalisation, or whether the authorities are simply putting on the brakes. Chinese economists scoff at western concerns about possible backsliding in reform, saying the government has been forced into more decisive measures by a resurgence of inflation and by signs that an increasing number of cash-starved state industries are on the verge of collapse. Professor Dong Fureng, one of China's most senior economists in his role as director of the Institute of Economics at the Academy of Social Sciences, said last night that the government was obliged to resort to a more interventionist approach to slow an economy which was still growing too fast. The present rate of economic growth was 'unsustainable', he said, and resources such as power supplies and transportation continued to be overstretched. This in turn was exacerbating inflation. 'If inflation goes too high, it will cause chaos,' Prof Dong added. This is the same message that Mr Li Peng, the Chinese premier, delivered at the weekend when announcing that for the rest of this year countering inflation would be the government's leading priority. Mr Li raised the spectre of social unrest to justify sterner measures. Official alarm about inflation was heightened by the July urban retail figures which showed that prices had jumped 24.2 per cent for the 12 months, reversing a moderating trend. The bad result followed release of capital spending figures which revealed an astonishing leap of 73 per cent in July in fixed asset investment compared with the same period last year. Western economists in Beijing say the government has recognised that the macro-control measures announced in July 1993, including a credit squeeze, had not been sufficient to calm an economy which grew by 13 per cent or more in the past two years. But they worry that deepening alarm about inflation may cause the authorities to repeat mistakes of the past such as the severe retrenchment of 1988 which came in response to price rises of 20 per cent and more. The abrupt slowdown in economic activity in 1988-89 is cited as a main reason for the Tiananmen Square disturbances. Chinese leaders will want to avoid repeating the same mistake but economists worry that avoiding a bumpy as opposed to a soft landing (retrenchment without too much pain) may be easier said than done.</p>

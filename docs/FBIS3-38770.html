Today, this excuse will not  wash. Humankind knows all about Bosnia and still it does  nothing.    When a mortar shell lands on a crowded Sarajevo market  square, the whole world can witness its impact first-hand: 68  dead and about 200 wounded, according to yesterday's body count.  As [Paris Archbishop] Lustiger said, this is indeed "a crime  against humanity."    Politicians the world over are on the same wavelength. Using  the same words, they indignantly condemn this new act of  savagery. These seasoned hypocrites even sometimes let  themselves shed bitters tears before they start their aimless  arm-waving. They should be forgiven for they do not know what  they are saying any more.    See Bill Clinton; chin jutting, looking like he hopes that  someone will hold his arm lest he starts thrashing about, the  U.S. President has been envisaging the possibility of agreeing  to NATO air strikes "once responsibilities have been assigned."  In other words, he does not rule out retaliatory action. But  these are tired words he has already uttered many times, as have  all Western leaders, including the French. Is it any wonder  that the Serb aggressor remains unimpressed?    Politicians should therefore agree to a moratorium. From now  on, here and everywhere else, they -- with only a few exceptions  -- should keep their mouth shut when it comes to the Bosnian  tragedy, which they themselves prompted before abandoning its  victims to their fate.    Consider the facts. First of all, when a Pandora's box of  Serb, Croat, or Bosnian nationalisms opened on the ruins of the  former Yugoslavia, their applause was deafening. Then, through  fatalism, thoughtlessness, or demagogy, they encouraged ethnic  fanaticisms of all stripes by giving birth to a Bosnia which had  not been asking for such solicitude. Above all, they would not  intervene before the conflict erupted, when -- in the spring of  1991 -- such a conflict had become a definite possibility and  sending a simple peacekeeping force to Bosnia was still a  sufficient preventive measure. Even worse than a crime, this  was a sin.    Therefore the only way for politicians to recover a measure  of decency is to keep silent. Unless they stick to facts, like  new U.S. Defense Secretary Perry, who indicated yesterday that  the 28,000 blue helmets currently in the former Yugoslavia "are  surrounded by 200,000 war-ready fighters." Because they are not  allowed to use their weapons, UN soldiers are not in a position  to bring the war to a halt. In the field, the generals --  consequently punished by the United Nations -- had been saying  nothing but that. One can therefore see the limits of  humanitarian action: All it relieves is the conscience of its  sponsors.    What are we to do, then? Stop blurting out empty threats.  Make examples, for the sake of history. Send an ultimatum to  the belligerents, provided we are ready to use force to  implement its terms. Otherwise, there will be one more casualty  in Sarajevo: our honor.</p>

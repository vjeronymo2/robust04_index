This year, the  Guangxi Government will continue to crack down severely on drug  smuggling and trafficking in close cooperation with the Hong  Kong police. When talking about the illegal entry into Hong  Kong by Vietnamese refugees, Lei Yu said: Based on statements of  investigations, at the news conference it held in Hong Kong, the  UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees clarified that,  of the refugees who had illegally sneaked into Hong Kong, no  more than 100 came from Guangxi. At present, the repatriation  of the refugees is underway.    According to Lei Yu, last year the scope of foreign  investment expanded greatly. Hong Kong businessmen Li Shao-kee  and Cheng Yu-tong invested in Guangxi and Robert Kwok made large  investments in Beihai City's Fangcheng Port. This year, Guangxi  will build the infrastructure on a large scale and strive to  become the "most convenient thoroughfare" which "with the great  southwest behind, serves the great southwest and faces Southeast  Asia, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan."    Guangxi leaders made these remarks at today's "News  Conference on Guangxi's Reform, Opening up, and Economic  Development." When answering a Hong Kong reporter's question,  Lei Yu said: Guangxi shares a 1,025-km land frontier and  1,595-km coastline with its neighboring countries. Making use  of this long frontier and coastline, many lawless elements carry  out gunrunning and drug trafficking. The Guangxi Government has  always adopted severe measures to deal with lawless elements.  Last year, the government boosted the police force by 700  personnel to specially cope with gunrunners and drug traffickers  and seized more than 10 kg of heroin, some 800 kg of opium, and  about 300 guns (mostly smuggled in from outside the borders),  and arrested over 300 smugglers (mostly members of gangs  comprising several persons). The Guangxi leader went on to say:  We have always maintained close coordination with the Hong Kong  police. This has been the case in the past and it will remain  unchanged in the days to come.    When briefing the news conference on Guangxi's economic  construction and the bid to improve its investment environment,  Cheng Kejie said: In the last two years, we have built or  extended five airports. For example, Guilin and Beihai Airports  are international and Liuzhou and Wuzhou Airports are expected  to be available for operation this year. Moreover, five railway  lines, two expressways, and hydropower and thermal power  stations with a total generating capacity of 8.2 million kwh are  under construction. All these projects will better serve  Guangxi's and the great southwest's opening up and economic  construction. According to statistics, last year, Guangxi put  $1 billion into practical use, had 4,360 foreign-invested  enterprises, and earned $1.325 billion in foreign currency by  exporting goods, a big increase on the 1992 figure. The scope  of foreign investment also expanded remarkably. There was a  marked increase in the number of investing countries, regions,  and big financial groups and firms. In June this year,  Singapore's political celebrity Lee Kuan Yew will hold  consultations with Guangxi on developing an industrial park in  Beihai. Thailand's foreign exchange dealers are negotiating  with Guangxi on 18 projects and applying to set up an office in  Nanning. Malaysia and Guangxi will open Beihai to Southeast  Asia sea routes.    On the issue of Guangxi shaking off poverty, Cheng Kejie  said: Ten percent of China's poor households are in Guangxi.  This being the case, Guangxi's task in shaking off poverty is  very arduous. Apart from implementing the "87 Program [solving  the problem of food and clothing for 80 million people in  poverty-stricken areas within 7 years]" cited in Li Peng's  Government Work Report, in carrying out the work of shaking off  poverty, we have worked out a plan to remove 200,000 people from  the most poverty-stricken areas within 8 years. We began to  implement the program last year and moved 23,000 people to areas  where cultivable land and fresh water were available and where  there are schools and land available for road building. This  year we plan to move 25,000 people. The main difficulty facing  the plan is the funds problem. It will take about 6,000 to  7,000 yuan to relocate an especially poor household. The other  difficulty is the problem of how to achieve national unity  between those who are moved out and those who are moved in. The  State Council has clearly stated that it will give great support  to Guangxi in terms of finance and credit.</p>

			<p>920310 FT  10 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber experts begin talks on buffer stock scheme A PANEL of rubber marketing experts yesterday began a week-long meeting here to review the International Natural Rubber Organisation's buffer stock operations, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur. The ad hoc group, set up in January by the Inro council at the request of the US, will study the market impact and cost-effectiveness of Inro buying and selling rubber, one delegate said. The group comprises rubber traders and officials from Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, the European Community and the US. The panel will recommend possible changes to the Inro's operations at the next regular council meeting from May 19 to 27. The May meeting is expected to reconsider future talks to negotiate the International Natural Rubber Agreement, which is administered by Inro. Producer and consumer members of Inro are divided over whether to start talks to negotiate a new pact to replace the current five-year Inro, which can be extended by another two years beyond December 1993. The producers, led by Malaysia, have said they are pushing for early Inra talks.</p>

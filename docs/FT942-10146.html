			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / Fingerprint decision near The Home Office is close to deciding on the final shortlist of companies to implement the first comprehensive national automated fingerprint recognition system. The system, which will cost Pounds 45m at present prices, will be used by the 43 police forces in England and Wales. The 18 tenderers have been reduced to 10 - Arvin Calspan, Digital Equipment, Electronic Data Systems, International Business Machines, SAIC, TRW and Unisys of the US, Groupe Bull of France, ICL, owned by Fujitsu of Japan, and Siemens Nixdorf of Germany. On Monday the list will be reduced to four and a final decision will be made in October for the system, which will be introduced in three years. A number of police forces are already making use of an IBM automated fingerprint recognition service. The intention is that the new system will for the first time combine identification of fingerprints discovered at the scene of a crime and personal identification - comparing a suspect's prints with those held on the database.</p>

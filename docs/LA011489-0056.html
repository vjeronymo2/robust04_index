			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HELIX FRUSTRATED BY MONTE VISTA  </P> <P> Here's a basketball tip: A team is in trouble when its 6-foot 7-inch center is  shooting 3-pointers.  </P> <P> And that's exactly where John Pressler, Helix's center, stood late in a  Grossmont League 3-A game with Monte Vista Friday night at Helix.  </P> <P> By that time it was too late for the Highlanders, who were easily handled by  Monte Vista, 64-48.  </P> <P> The game featured the league's two undefeated teams and two biggest big men.  Monte Vista (8-4, 4-0) had 6-8 center Joe McNaull, while Helix (9-5, 3-1)  countered with Pressler.  </P> <P> But Monte Vista took advantage of a superior perimeter game and sagging  defense. The Monarchs spread a 27-18 halftime lead to 49-26 by the end of the  third quarter and were never threatened.  </P> <P> Helix spent three quarters on the outside looking in, and always for Pressler,  who had a game-high 20 points plus 15 rebounds and 2 blocks.  </P> <P> But with McNaull playing behind him and two or three others sagging, Monte  Vista forced Helix to take the outside shot. And Helix could not respond until  Monte Vista had the game well in hand, 59-31, with 5:25 left.  </P> <P> "What I wanted to do was not jump when he pump-faked," said McNaull, who had 11  points, 12 rebounds and 3 blocks. "I read where he fouled out some guy by  pump-faking. I just wanted to get him in foul trouble as early as possible."  </P> <P> Pressler's frustration with Monte Vista's defense showed when he tried to elbow  past McNaull and drew his third foul with 2:57 left in the third quarter.  Pressler was called for his fourth personal 19 seconds later while trying to  rebound.  </P> <P> Jeff Polinsky led Monte Vista with 19 points and Curt Howard added 11.  </P></p>

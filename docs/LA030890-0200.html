			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA REGIONAL BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> BREA-OLINDA GIRLS WOULD SEEM TO HAVE ALL THE ADVANTAGES  </P> <P> Defending Division III state champion Brea-Olinda retained its home-court  advantage, but Orange County's other two first-round survivors -- La Quinta and  Costa Mesa -- will be on the road when the Southern California Regional girls'  basketball playoffs continue tonight.  </P> <P> The winners of tonight's 7:30 games advance to the regional championships on  Saturday at the Los Angeles Sports Arena.  </P> <P> In Division II:  </P> <P> La Quinta (28-2) at San Diego Point Loma (28-3): La Quinta is in for a tough  game against top-seeded Point Loma, which has scoring balance, height,  maturity, tradition and the home-court advantage.  </P> <P> Point Loma has won a San Diego Section championship five times since 1984,  including 1989 and '90.  </P> <P> The current Pointers are averaging 56 points a game and holding opponents to  27. They have won 14 consecutive games, including a 66-36 trouncing of West  Torrance Tuesday night. La Quinta defeated West Torrance, 72-62, last Friday.  </P> <P> Point Loma has four starters averaging in double figures. Tyeast Brown, a  6-foot center averages 22.3 points and 10 rebounds a game. Forward Ericka  Crittenden (5-8) averages 13.5 points a game. Six-foot Robin Rabello is the  leading rebounder (12 per game). She and 5-8 junior guard Stacy Wainwright  average 10 points each. Claudine Neves (5-6) averages 4.2 points.  </P> <P> In Division III:  </P> <P> Lemoore (21-7) at Brea-Olinda (31-0): Lemoore, the Central Section Division III  champion, is led by forwards Rachel Rossiter (14 ppg), the school's all-time  leading scorer, and Amy Haire (13 ppg), who transferred to Lemoore this season.  </P> <P> Rossiter is 5-9, Haire is 5-8. Ginger Thayer (5-11) is the tallest Tiger. The  Lemoore backcourt -- Jennifer Cotta (5-6) and Dana Bezerra (5-2) -- must  contend with the best backcourt in the state in Brea-Olinda's Aimee McDaniel,  the defending Division Player of the Year, and Tammy Blackburn.  </P> <P> The two, along with 6-foot post player Jody Anton and 5-9 center Jinelle  Williams, average in double figures in scoring. Allison Bickell is the fifth  starter.  </P> <P> With a 19-point performance in Brea's first-round victory, McDaniel passed  Carrie Eagan's total of 1,779 points to become the Lady Cats' all-time scoring  leader.  </P> <P> Top-seeded Brea-Olinda has a 53-game winning streak, which should reach 54  tonight.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa (18-11) at Palos Verdes (27-5): Look for Costa Mesa's Cinderella  season to run into serious trouble on the road. Palos Verdes is definitely the  Mustangs' toughest, most talented opponent to date.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes came within 17 points of Brea-Olinda, 50-33, in the Southern  Section 3-AA championship game. That doesn't sound like much, but it is the  closest any nationally unranked team has come to Brea-Olinda since Channel  Islands got within three points at the Santa Barbara Tournament of Champions in  December.  </P> <P> Palos Verdes has the height advantage with 6-3 Monique Morehouse (11 ppg), 6-0  Mary Maloney (9.9 ppg), 6-0 Kristen Jaconi and 5-10 Lisa Humphreys (15 ppg). At  5-6, guard Susan Wilhite (10 ppg) is the shortest starter. Costa Mesa starts a  5-10 forward, Rachel Ward (11 ppg), and four other players 5-9 or shorter.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa won its first Southern Section title (3-A) this season. The Mustangs  are led by 5-9 freshman Olivia DiCamilli, who keeps coming through for them in  the playoffs. Tuesday, she sank a turnaround jump shot at the buzzer to push  Costa Mesa past its first-round opponent, Selma, 44-42.  </P></p>

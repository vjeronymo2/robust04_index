			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Beijing's  self-employed business operators turned over 280 million yuan in  taxes in 1993, an increase of 90 percent over 1990, according to  the Beijing Taxation Bureau.    The number of these operators was 224,000, an increase of  68.4 percent over 1990.    Furthermore, an official from the bureau said, cases of tax  evasion have declined drastically.    He attributed all this to improved tax regulations as well  as  the heightened awareness of the importance of paying taxes on  the part of the public.    Statistics show that the income tax paid by individuals has  increased by 58.2 percent since 1990 and hit 123 million yuan in  1993.    The official said the main part of the individual income tax  comes from highly paid Chinese employees of foreign-funded  ventures.    The number of private enterprises increased to about 4,000  in  1993 from only eight in 1988, while the tax they turned over  increased from about 100,000 yuan to 130 million yuan.    He admitted that tax returns from people in entertainment  circles, contractors of construction enterprises and commodity  brokers are far from satisfactory.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Regional News Hookup" program] </F>   [Text] At a meeting on summing up work for 1993 and  commuting sentences which was held by the 1st autonomous  regional reform-though-labor detachment on 31 January, prison  terms for 90 prisoners were reduced as awards for having  conscientiously followed prison rules and for truly repenting  during their sentences. Of these, 19 were granted reductions in  sentences or released on parole. They were discharged  immediately following the meeting.    It is reported that during their sentences, some of these  prisoners who were given such awards exemplarily obeyed various  prison rules; some worked diligently to study production and  labor skills and brought considerable economic wealth to the  prison and the state; and some bravely fought against other  criminals' harmful behaviors. The reduction of these prisoners'  sentences is to fully display the aim of our state's law for  integrating punishment with reform. Based on the same  principle, another 119 prisoners who behaved well in the first  reform-though-labor detachment were given material rewards.</p>

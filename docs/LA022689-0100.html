			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOOT-'EM-UPS  </P> <P> When are people such as Alex Murashko (Letters, Feb. 5) going to learn that  real gunplay and reel gunplay are as different as apples and oranges?  </P> <P> I'm sure the producers of "No Retreat, No Surrender II" had no intention of  bringing to mind the tragic shooting in Stockton. And I'm sure when people go  to see movies like "No Retreat" or "Rambo," "Commando" and others, the  tragedies of what they saw on the 6 o'clock news certainly doesn't enter their  minds. They're going to see a movie, for God's sakes!  </P> <P> What do you suggest the movie makers use instead of firearms? Peashooters?  </P> <P> HOWARD L. MOORE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

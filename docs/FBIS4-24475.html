			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Beijing To Allow Tibet To Open More to the Outside World" </F> -- ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE headline]    [Excerpt] The central government has in the past 40 years  invested a total of 20 billion yuan in the Tibet Autonomous  Region, establishing there a situation of economic development,  stability, ethnic solidarity, and social progress. In 1993,  Tibet's GDP was 3.05 billion yuan, its peasants' per-capita  income 521 yuan, and there was relatively rapid development in  the region's agriculture, animal husbandry, industry,  infrastructure, and foreign trade.    Gyaincain Norbu, Tibet Autonomous Regional People's  Government chairman, said at the National People's Congress  session in mid-May: "1994 has been a critical year for our  region in that it has seen comprehensive reforms, wholesale  progress, key breakthroughs, and stepped-up efforts at creating  a socialist market economic system." Regarding reforms, "efforts  are under way to install a mechanism for the transfer of user's  rights to land and pasture with compensation" and to encourage  peasants and herdsmen to open up wasteland by "granting the  operating rights to whoever opens up the land"; and  manufacturing enterprises are transforming their operating  mechanisms and rationalizing their business organization.  Regarding opening up, Tibet has been exploiting its proximity  to the border. It is improving its border ports, initiating  cooperation with neighboring countries in many areas, improving  the investment environment to attract more foreign and domestic  investment, cooperating further with enterprises from the rest  of the country to build more joint export bases, developing  tourism, and so on.</p>

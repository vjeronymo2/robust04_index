			<p>941109 FT  09 NOV 94 / Imports of coal 'could be reduced' RJB Mining, the company selected by the government as preferred bidder for British Coal's English mines, has told miners that UK coal should be able to displace more than a third of the 17m tonnes of imports annually. It did not, however, assume displacing any of the coal in making its bid. Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, says in an interview with Coal News, the British Coal newspaper for employees, that 'our commercial calculations are based on there being no upturn in prices and no upturn in sales'. His comments will fuel the controversy surrounding RJB's bid which, at Pounds 900m, was at least 50 per cent higher than the next highest offer for the three English regions. Rival bidders believe there will be considerable contraction in the market. Some doubt whether RJB can make significant profits if it pays as much as Pounds 900m, and are puzzled that the company believes it can do so without displacing imports. In the interview Mr Budge says UK coal should be able to displace between 6m and 7m tonnes of the 17m imported into the UK every year. The company is not planning closures in the short term. 'We will not close any mine that is making a profit,' he said. In a further commitment to the future, the company is also planning a school-leaver recruitment programme, offering apprenticeships across the full range of mining skills.</p>

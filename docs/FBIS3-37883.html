A memorial devoted to deportation victims was opened in  Groznyy, the Chechen capital. About 5000 stones taken from  cemeteries and used for road construction and other purposes  after the Chechens' deportation in 1994 are in the center of  this memorial.    Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev addressed several  thousand  Groznyy residents and citizens from other regions of the  republic after a mourning and public prayer ceremony. He said  that more than 600,000 Chechens and Ingushes perished during the  deportation period.    A military parade took place in Svoboda Square in front of  the presidential palace in the center of Groznyy. Dudayev  commanded the parade.    The coffin with the body of Georgia's late ex-president  Zviad  Gamsakhurdia was carried on an artillery gun-carriage via the  square before the parade. The coffin was placed in the marble  hall of the House of Government. Gamsakhurdia's burial ceremony  is scheduled for 15:00 local time on Thursday, February 24.</p>

			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Survey of The Isle of Man (1): A thriving outpost few want to leave The island enjoys political stability; fund management is growing fast, fuelled by generous tax breaks; banking and insurance already have a sure hold.  Yet some people resent the growing power of the EC, while others fear that a mainland government committed to cutting income tax may reduce the island's attractiveness to UK citizens. Tourism is seen as a possible area for expansion, though it might create only temporary jobs TIMES MAY be hard in the rest of the British isles, but in the Isle of Man, the Celtic outpost of the Irish Sea, business is booming. One of the prime reasons will be familiar to anybody who watched the UK election campaign - personal taxation. Mr Donald Gelling, the Manx finance minister, presented his budget earlier this month, and the tax rates he announced would certainly have been enough to win the UK election. The basic rate of income tax is 15 per cent, with a top rate of 20 per cent. Tax relief at the top rate is available on all loans from Manx lenders - that includes credit cards as well as mortgages - and personal allowances before tax is payable stand at Pounds 6,000 for those who are single, and Pounds 12,000 for married couples. A family unit can earn Pounds 28,000 before incurring tax at the top rate of 20 per cent. No wonder so many businessmen who go to the island never want to leave. The UK election may have removed the possibility of higher tax rates, which would automatically have increased the attractions of investing offshore; but Labour had been keen to attack the island's tax privileges, so the Manx business community was not distraught. Financial services continue to grow, and unemployment, while it has risen slightly to around 1,200, is still at a level which any UK politician would describe as 'full employment'. Leaps forward in the regulation of the financial services sector, since the establishment of the Financial Supervision Commission in 1983, have triggered a fast expansion in the island's financial services industry. It was the first offshore jurisdiction to win designated status under the UK's Financial Services Act of 1988, which effectively recognised that the Manx offered the same degree of investor protection as the British. Fund management is growing fast on the island, fuelled by generous tax breaks announced last year, and operative since the beginning of this month. Banking and insurance already have a sure hold. Political stability is profound, as the Tynwald, the Manx parliament, sails serenely into its second millennium. It is the longest continuous parliament in the world. Overcrowding is not a problem, and shows no signs of becoming one - the island's 70,000 population is roughly equal to that of Jersey, but spread over an area six times as large. It is also well educated, providing a valuable pool of labour. But not everything in the garden is lovely. The budget also announced a slight deficit this year, and Mr Gelling provided a Pounds 4m 'kick start' for the industrial sector. And there are broader causes for concern. Ugly sentiments have been stirred up by a confrontation with the European Community. The Tynwald has never got round to legalising homosexuality, to which many of the islanders, who tend to have a very traditionalist moral outlook, object strongly. But the island is a party to the convention of the European Court of Human Rights, which upholds gay rights. Many who had no quarrel with gay rights objected to new laws being forced on the island by the European Court. Attempts by the political leadership to pass legislation allowing homosexuality between consenting adults therefore led to passionate rows in the Tynwald, physical threats against those who led the drive for reform, and some deeply reactionary letters to local newspapers. Following a majority of two in the House of Keys, the Tynwald's equivalent of the Commons, reform now seems certain to reach the statute book without a constitutional showdown. But islanders have been greatly embarrassed by some of the coverage of the incident which appeared in UK tabloids. There is also cause for concern on the commercial front. Mr Colin Coates, a partner with Touche Ross, made some heretical comments in a presentation to the island's business community immediately after the budget. The reaction to his arguments was divided, but he seemed to prove that the island cannot yet afford to rest on its laurels. In particular, the growing power of Europe could pose a threat. This is what Mr Coates had to say: 'Close to home, we have a Tory Government committed to reducing income tax, to limiting the impact of inheritance tax, and to allow the creators of wealth to retain a greater portion of that wealth. This must reduce the fiscal attractiveness of the island to UK-based individuals. 'The extent to which the European Community is a market for our financial and professional services is debatable. Offshore centres within the EC, and more are entering the fray, have considerable marketing advantages, as evidenced by UK groups establishing in Luxembourg rather than the Isle of Man and Channel Islands. It does not appear that EC tax harmonisation is going to affect these centres for the foreseeable future.' Mr Michael Gates, corporate development officer for the island, rejects this argument more or less in its entirety. He points out that the current advantages flowing to Luxembourg and Dublin within the EC cannot last forever, while Manx legislation has ensured that the island's funds need not miss out on the opportunities for cross-border marketing of mutual funds. Meanwhile, the UK's current massive borrowing requirement should be enough to ensure that a hefty tax differential is maintained, according to Mr Gates. Should the UK opt to raise VAT, the differentials could be widened. The island has to levy VAT at the same rate as the mainland, so this would provide an increase in the government's income, allowing further cuts in personal taxes. So Mr Coates' final suggestion is for renewed investment in an unfashionable area - tourism. He said: 'If Tory policy succeeds, a growing number of people in the UK will enjoy higher levels of disposable income. The island is on their doorstep. It is a beautiful island with incredible potential to market its historical sites and its recreational facilities. Every weekend the island should be crawling with tourists taking two- or three-day breaks. When it gets to the point when we start to complain about the tourists, that is when the industry will be a success.' There is some force in this argument, and Mr Miles Walker, the chief minister, is keen to expand the island's tourist industry. Take away the financial services sector, and the island looks more like Cornwall than Jersey or Guernsey. Wild, starkly beautiful Celtic countryside leads to dramatic cliffs and long beaches. The island's bizarre climate means that palm trees grow in relative profusion. The population has been deprived of its old mining industry - just like the Cornish - while its fisheries and agriculture have contracted. Meanwhile, it clings to a Celtic heritage, including the remnants of a native language. Some businessmen enthused to Mr Coates' ideas, saying the Isle of Man should be known as 'activity island'. But the suspicion remains that jobs in tourism would be temporary. The terrace of Edwardian guesthouses in Douglas, which currently services the influx of visitors for the annual TT motor-cycle races, would have difficulty accommodating a large tourist trade, and heavy investment in infrastructure would be necessary first. Mr Gates is keener to look for other areas of development. He points to the 'ball park' figures of the island's success - employment in the financial sector has trebled in 10 years, despite computers, bank deposits on the island total Pounds 9.5bn, and the number of captive insurers has increased from three to 117 since 1981. His interests now are to encourage more fund managers to come to the island, and to persuade executives to use it as a base for international holding companies. A review of company taxation was announced in the budget, while the maximum registration fee for a company wishing to capitalise itself on the island was slashed from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 5,000. The Manx are adamant that Europe is not a threat - indeed, they are hunting new business in the Far East and in North America. Their role model now is not Jersey, Guernsey, or even Luxembourg. It is Bermuda. According to Mr Gelling, the Isle of Man could play the same role for Europe which Bermuda does for the US: 'The island expects that it will become one of the key 'gateways' for funds flowing into the EC's major financial centres from the Far East, North America and elsewhere.' The problems raised by Touche Ross remain to be confronted, but the island cannot be faulted in the determination of its attempt to establish itself in this key world role.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- RETAIL PRICES AT MID-JANUARY: PERCENTAGE CHANGES OVER . . .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         *Index   1 month   3 months   6 months   1 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- All items                360.3       0.2        0.4        1.3      5.7 All items, excluding   food                   355.9       0.1        0.0        1.2      5.5 Food                     375.6       0.8        2.5        2.1      6.9 Alcoholic drink          414.7       1.2        0.0        2.1     11.3 Tobacco                  519.5       0.0        2.6        3.0     16.8 Housing                  391.2      -0.2       -0.2       -0.2      0.2 Fuel and light           316.7      -0.1        0.0        2.8     -8.7 Durable household goods  334.9      -0.9        0.7        1.3      7.8 Clothing and footwear    222.4       0.7        0.7        2.1      6.3 Transport and vehicles   345.0      -0.8       -1.8       -0.9      6.8 Miscellaneous goods      354.9      -0.1        0.3        2.2      6.4 Services                 355.3       1.5        1.4        3.6      9.9 Meals out                379.1       0.0       -0.7        0.6     11.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *March 1976: Index = 100  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Economic Affairs Division  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

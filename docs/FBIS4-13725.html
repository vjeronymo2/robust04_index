			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto by Wolfgang </F> Koydl in Germany; date not given: "Our Only Security Is Nuclear  Technology"]    [Text] [Bhutto] The last time I was in Germany was 28  years ago. However, despite the Wall, the Cold War, and the  bipolar world I realized even at that time that Germany was a  country with industrious people who work hard, and would,  therefore, emerge as an important factor in the world at some  time. I see that this is happening now. I have come to Germany  to discuss the international situation with the chancellor, with  a particular focus on Kashmir and Bosnia. In addition, I talked  with him about closer cooperation in the field of  industrialization. I explained the overall situation to him,  because Pakistan has an agreement with the IMF and the World  Bank and has now embarked upon a solid economic path. In this  connection, I expressed my interest in Hermes guarantees to the  chancellor. You see, German companies have invested so much in  Russia -- without success. Now they should invest in Pakistan  -- with far more success. The World Bank has called Pakistan  one of the seven most important capital markets of the future,  and there are enormous possibilities, in particular in the  fields of energy and communications.    [Koydl] Let us come to Bosnia. A few weeks ago you visited  Sarajevo together with your Turkish counterpart Tansu Ciller.    [Bhutto] The most important thing is to lift the arms  embargo against the Muslims as soon as possible. For me the  issue is not so much that Muslims are being killed in Bosnia,  even though I, personally, find that very painful. Rather, the  issue is that people are dying there. Above all, it needs to be  made clear that aggression does not pay off, that the aggression  of the Serbs does not pay off. Therefore, the embargo against  Bosnia must be lifted.    [Koydl] Regarding a more intensive involvement by German  industry in Pakistan, one precondition would be that Pakistan  release more money for civilian development. So far, your  country has had to spend about 70 percent of its budget on  national security. One reason for that is the conflict with  India over Kashmir.    [Bhutto] This is correct. One of the reasons why Germany  was able to grow was that others took care of its security  needs. We have to do that ourselves. We have waged three wars,  our country was divided -- eastern Pakistan turned into  Bangladesh -- all because of Indian aggression. India is our  neighbor, and because India does not get on well with any of its  neighboring states, we have had to spend more than we wanted on  our defense. Therefore, we have suggested to India talks on  various topics -- from Kashmir to the nonproliferation of  nuclear weapons to missile systems and balanced troop reduction.  Unfortunately, the entire matter has ended in a stalemate  because India refuses to discuss seriously the problem of  Kashmir.    [Koydl] In the United States opinion seems to be changing  regarding the issue of Kashmir. Does the United States not  support Pakistan's position now?    [Bhutto] I do not see this as a change in opinion. The  United States just describes the legal situation correctly when  it calls Kashmir a disputed territory. The area is still  disputed because India has so far prevented the implementation  of the UN Resolution demanding a referendum for Jammu and  Kashmir. However, I do not share the view of other states that  urge us toward a bilateral solution with India. Bilateral talks  have not shown any results for more than 40 years. Therefore,  we believe that we should now try multilateral paths or  mediation by a third party.    [Koydl] Who could act as a mediator?    [Bhutto] We would be pleased if the United States were to  act as a mediator. However, we would also be pleased if Germany  played this role. Any country that has good relations with  India and Pakistan could take over the role of honest broker.    [Koydl] Did you broach potential mediation by Germany in  your talks with Chancellor Kohl?    [Bhutto] The chancellor was very worried about the situation  on the subcontinent. However, I do not want to give any  details; it is the business of my foreign minister to present  this in appropriate diplomatic language.    [Koydl] The United States also seems to have given in  regarding the supply of F-16 combat planes to Pakistan, the  delivery of which was stopped because of the Pakistani nuclear  program.    [Bhutto] It would be precipitate to speak of giving in. The  situation is extremely complicated. We can say this much:  There was a dialogue with the United States, which was supposed  to sound out how we could improve bilateral relations. We see  these F-16's as part of a purchasing contract. We paid for  them. Therefore, we either want the planes or our money back.  However, the delivery was suspended by a law adopted by  Congress that prohibits any aid to Pakistan. Therefore, it will  not be easy to find a way out. However, we believe that the  Clinton administration is tackling the problem of nuclear  nonproliferation in a more balanced manner. This administration  is advocating the reduction and elimination of these weapons at  the regional level, without picking out just Pakistan. This  change is to be welcomed.    [Koydl] The reason for the problems with the United States  is the Pakistani nuclear program. Last year your predecessor  Nawaz Sharif told SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG: "We do not have any  nuclear bomb, nor will we build one." Is this statement still  correct?    [Bhutto] Let me put it this way: We could have had a  nuclear weapon, but we decided against it. It is quite  different whether one does not have nuclear weapons because one  cannot build them or whether one does not have any even though  one could build them. We do not have any nuclear weapons  because Pakistan is generally committed to a policy of  nonproliferation. And even though India has detonated a bomb,  Pakistan has shown enormous restraint by not carrying out a  nuclear test, not exporting any technology, and not producing  any fissionable material. We believe that Pakistan's sensible  and peace-loving attitude in this matter should be recognized  and rewarded. It is also extremely important for peace and  security in the world that this is recognized and rewarded.    [Koydl] During your visit to North Korea last December you  defended each nation's right to nuclear technology.    [Bhutto] The purpose of my visit to North Korea was not to  discuss nuclear proliferation or nonproliferation. I visited  North Korea, which Pakistan has had relations with for a long  time, because I was in China and, therefore, it was simpler from  the logistical point of view, to go to North Korea at that time  than at another time. We discussed many different material  issues, such as cheap housing construction, but not the  proliferation of nuclear technology.    [Koydl] But your words that any nation has a right to  nuclear technology were quoted most often.    [Bhutto] I am indeed of the opinion that any nation has a  right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, absolutely.  I have been someone who is aware of the environment since my  time as a student. At that time I collected old newspapers and  recycled them. In particular because I am convinced that the  treasures of nature must be preserved, I also think that nuclear  technology, which is clean and environmentally compatible, must  provide us with electricity. On the other hand, I am strictly  in favor of preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,  and, therefore, I would like to see a balanced regional  solution. Pakistan cannot take any unilateral steps on the  subcontinent, because we have had three wars in the past. It is  difficult for Pakistan to keep pace with conventional armament  in India. Therefore, our only security and our only guarantee  is the nuclear technology that we have acquired -- even if we  have not developed it to the point to which we could develop it  and do not intend to do so -- unless our survival were at stake.    [Koydl] Then you are clearly in favor of extending the  Nonproliferation Treaty next year?    [Bhutto] On an equal basis.    [Koydl] What do you mean by that?    [Bhutto] This means that it must not be that some countries  are included and others are excluded. I want a just solution  for the Nonproliferation Treaty, not one that is basically  discriminatory.    [Koydl] Could you explain this in a bit more detail. Who  discriminates against whom?    [Bhutto] I am only saying that there should be one nuclear  policy for all the world and not two different nuclear policies.</p>

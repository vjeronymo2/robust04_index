He noted that quite recently Polish representatives had  signed a declaration regarding Poland's admission into NATO.  "Well, what happened? How long was it in force? It lasted just  a few weeks. So no one should wonder about our mistrust," Walesa  said.    "The West is offering us today the Partnership for Peace.  That sounds nice. A partnership is a union of independent and  equal countries, which strive for established aim. They are  equal at any desk, not only at the one whose documents are  signed. And this initiative lacks this equilibrium," he added.    He said in his address that Poles did not conceive admission  into NATO as changing sides. "Therefore, we believe that NATO  must remain open also for new members," Walesa stated.    He stressed that he felt uneasy when "thinking about the  fate  of our continent, its unity and solidarity." The idea that "the  fall of communism bring the world of the East closer to the West  and will make the two worlds into one" has not materialized,  Walesa said. As far as security and economy are concerned, no  progress has been achieved either, he stated.    "The preservation of this situation seems to be in the  interest of the powerful of this world. The vision of a common  house is gone. The idea of a divided, confrontational Europe is  being born again. There is blackmailing Russia which is afraid  of NATO expansion, in which it sees an enemy. There is the  hesitating West. And there is us who say: Do not be afraid, do  not let us accept the logic of the military staffs. Let us get  rid of confrontational thought," Walesa stated.    At the end of his address, Walesa expressed the hope that  today's talks would bring closer the horizon of "our way to  NATO."</p>

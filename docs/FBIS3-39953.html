			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by "s.m.": "Pannella the Dueller Aims for </F> Bull's-Eye"]    [Excerpt] Rome -- Once upon a time there was the Radical  Party. Then came the Anti-Prohibitionists and the Pannella List.  Now Marco Pannella has invented another label, that of the  "Reformers"; has revived his List; and has succeeded in planting  a number of loyal associates in areas dominated by the Northern  League, thanks to a last-minute agreement between Pannella and  [Forza Italia leader] Silvio Berlusconi. Thus, the keenest  supporter of the plain single-candidate system -- that is, of a  British-style two-party system -- is yet again swimming against  the tide and complicating matters by aligning his candidates  under three different banners (four, including the League's).  If this proves successful, Pannella will hit the bull's-eye.  If not, he and all his men risk missing a turn.    As he promised, Pannella will challenge Italian Social  Movement [MSI] Secretary Fini in the capital's most right-wing  constituency, Rome 24 (Prati-Flaminio-Tor di Quinto), where the  progressive forces are fielding Edoardo Missoni and the Pact is  fielding the Liberals' Costanza Pera. Running under the same  banner ("Pannella List-Reformers"), the paparazzo, Oliviero  Toscani, will be running against [Democratic Party of the Left  Secretary] Occhetto and Pierferdinando Casini [Christian  Democratic Center] in the red constituency of Bologna 3, while  Paolo Villaggio (who failed to be elected by a whisker last time  round, on Communist Renewal's list) will be standing in a  college in his home region of Liguria. These three different  names, with different backgrounds, perhaps share a common future  of almost certain defeat. Indeed, Pannella's aim seems to be,  rather, to make a provocative protest against the predominant  absence of real competition in this election.    But what about seats in parliament? Those should result from  the proportional quotas, to which the Pannella List will try to  accede in almost all the regions (apart from the smallest --  Umbria, Molise, Basilicata, Marches, and Calabria, where it has  not even presented lists). The other 19 constituencies will be  contested by (apart from Pannella himself) the usual members of  his clan -- Emma Bonino, Roberto Cicciomessere, Peppino  Calderisi, Massimo Teodori, Paolo Vigevano, Lorenzo Strik  Lievers, Marco Taradash, Elio Vito... The interconnections have  been so made that if the threshold of 4 percent is achieved the  whole clan will return to the lower house. If not, there will be  no seats, and it will be farewell to the Pannella List. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNEQUAL PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW FOR THERESA SALDANA  </P> <P> I reacted in horror to your article, "A Crime Without End." This nightmare does  not belong to Theresa Saldana alone. While it may affect her most directly, it  is shared by us all. Therefore, I direct this open letter to every elected  official of the State of California:  </P> <P> Shame on you! The principal function of a government is to protect the people  it represents. You have abrogated your responsibilities. If the legislature,  administration and judiciary cannot, either singly or together, protect us from  a convicted felon with documented mental instabilities and a self-professed  intent to commit further mayhem, then it is time for all of you to resign so  that we may elect other, more competent public servants.  </P> <P> RAYMOND D. BUTNER  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

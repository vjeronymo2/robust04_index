			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Letter: Regulators giving unsatisfactory support at grassroots level Sir, There are two dimensions absent from your excellent leader, 'Reviewing the Regulators' (January 13). There is currently a debate instituted by the Post Office Users National Council (POUNC) on the need for an advisory body to represent the public interest and to carry out independent research and auditing, in addition to a regulatory body for a privatised utility with monopoly power. For example, in the case of the Post Office, the government is the regulator and POUNC the advisory body. As secretary of Bridport's local advisory committees for both the Post Office and Telecommunications, I do not find my relationship with Oftel as regulator altogether satisfactory. It is my considered view that Oftel does not give grassroots advisory bodies enough support and specific advice. The other matter is concerned with the quality of information on which regulators act. It is now commonplace to read of unsatisfactory audit reports from accountants, despite estimates suggesting that Britain employs per capita almost 10 times as many accountants as the Japanese economy. How can the regulators do their job if the information on which they act is flawed or unreliable? This is another argument for an independent advisory body capable of building up authoritative research to support a function of impartial advice to users and the government.

			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A BANNER DAY;  </P> <P> FLAG OBSERVANCES COME IN MANY DIFFERENT STRIPES  </P> <P> Burned by Boy Scouts, frozen by nuclear activists, serenaded by hundreds of  schoolchildren and marketed to Japanese tourists, Old Glory took center stage  Thursday on its official national holiday.  </P> <P> From 83-year-old Floyd Foran's front porch to the newest star on the Hollywood  Walk of Fame, the familiar patchwork of red, white and blue waved on, seemingly  oblivious to the ongoing debate about its sanctity being waged in the nation's  Capitol.  </P> <P> Flag Day is the bastard child of patriotic holidays, always upstaged by the  flashy Fourth of July and the reverent Veterans and Memorial days. Flag Day  began officially in 1916 and June 14 was chosen because, on that date in 1777,  the Continental Congress approved the Stars and Stripes as the nation's flag.  </P> <P> But Monday's Supreme Court ruling against a proposed law to protect the flag  from desecration, followed by President Bush's vow to continue the yearlong  fight for a constitutional amendment, was a common topic of conversation among  Flag Day participants.  </P> <P> "I'm with the President. If that's what it takes, we should do it," said Thomas  (Ski) Demski, who has flown a giant flag outside his Long Beach home for the  last 10 years. "You have to think about what it represents."  </P> <P> On Flag Day, Demski organized his annual flag raising, inviting 500 elementary  schoolchildren to witness the event. The wind picked up as he used his drill  motor to raise the 47-by-82-foot flag, causing it to stick on a light and  necessitating an encore of the national anthem.  </P> <P> Wearing a blue shirt, red shorts and white socks, Venice Beach activist Jerry  Rubin unveiled his frozen flag at the Federal Building in Westwood.  </P> <P> As he pulled a plastic garbage bag off a flag his brother, Marty, had kept in a  deep freeze since Monday, Rubin's explanation for his antics was filled with  puns and innuendo.  </P> <P> "I'm wondering if anyone is as burned up as I am about this proposed  constitutional amendment," Rubin said. "It would have a chilling effect on our  Bill of Rights."  </P> <P> Rubin said the ice also represented the nuclear weapons freeze supported by his  group, the Los Angeles Alliance for Survival.  </P> <P> He dropped the frozen flag to the ground, cracking the ice, as 15 reporters and  photographers recorded the moment.  </P> <P> Constantin Niculescu, who immigrated from Romania six years ago, shook Rubin's  hand after the media retreated.  </P> <P> "I'm a Republican, I'm totally against flag burning," Niculescu said. "But his  (Rubin's) protest is much more decent."  </P> <P> Niculescu, who was at the Federal Building seeking a permit to protest  communist oppression in his homeland, said it is "disgusting" to see the  American flag burned, but he doesn't mind the burning of Soviet flags, "because  the red in the Russian flag stands for blood."  </P> <P> Members of the Communist Youth Party threatened to steal Rubin's show by  burning a flag at the Federal Building at the same time. But they never  appeared.  </P> <P> Across town at the downtown Federal Building, opponents of U.S. policy in El  Salvador scrubbed an American flag stained red to symbolize getting the "blood"  out.  </P> <P> Foran, who has been flying a flag outside his Los Angeles home on virtually all  national holidays for more than 50 years, called those who chose to deface the  flag "stupid." But, he said, "if they want to be stupid let them."  </P> <P> He said he flies his flag more out of habit than anything else these days.  </P> <P> "I guess I'm as patriotic as anybody else. I'm an old man."  </P> <P> On Flag Day, Foran's was the only flag flying in his neighborhood.  </P> <P> The local flag burning Thursday did not result in controversy.  </P> <P> Six Boy Scouts from a Hollywood area troop retired the flag of the Kingsley  Manor retirement community Thursday evening by burning it in a barbecue. The  flag was about 2 years old and very faded and worn out, said the manor's  security officer, Lt. Dwight C. Dupee.  </P> <P> "They played taps . . . from a tape recording," Dupee said. "It was very nice."  </P> <P> But an anonymous caller to The Times complained that a tattered and dirty flag  that should be similarly retired still waved over the Witt-Thomas Productions  building in Vernon. The vacant warehouse was the former sound stage for the  now-defunct television program "Beauty and the Beast."  </P> <P> Composer John Philip Sousa was awarded the 1,914th star on Hollywood's Walk of  Fame, as the U.S. Marine Corps Band played one of his best known marches,  "Stars and Stripes Forever." Art Bartner, director of the USC marching band,  which also played at the unveiling, called the tune "our second national  anthem."  </P> <P> Within minutes of the ceremony, tourists were again walking up and down the row  of remembrances, stopping to point out Janet Jackson's plaque four stars away.  </P> <P> Don McWhorter, the attendant at the parking lot nearest Souza's star, reflected  on the significance of Flag Day. As a Korean War veteran, McWhorter said he  feels protective of the flag, but then again he understands the younger  generation's cynicism.  </P> <P> "Young people see what happened to the veterans of other wars and they don't  want to fight for their flag anymore," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / Canada tightens immigrant curbs Canada plans to dilute its traditional hospitality towards immigrants under a new long-term policy unveiled yesterday. Besides cutting the 1995 immigration quota by about 12 per cent, Mr Sergio Marchi, immigration minister, announced tighter curbs on family members seeking to join relatives already in Canada. The government will in future place a greater emphasis on attracting entrepreneurs and other independent immigrants with skills or wealth to contribute to the economy. The refugee quota will rise by as much as three-quarters to 24,000-32,000 a year. Studies indicate that new settlers in the family reunification category, especially parents and grandparents, place a relatively heavy burden on health and social services. Mr Marchi said the authorities may require bonds to be posted by immigrants sponsoring their families. The immigration clampdown coincides with pressure on the government to review Canada's multi-culturalism policy, under which ethnic communities are encouraged - often with support from public funds - to retain their distinct identity.</p>

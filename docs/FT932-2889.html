			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / A viewer's guide to TV - for next four years: Andrew Hill explains what the EC's wide-screen TV 'action plan' will mean for all those who watch - as well as those who make - television WHAT has happened? Telecommunications ministers have agreed to spend Ecu228m (Pounds 180m) of the European Community budget over the next four years promoting wide-screen television services in Europe, after Britain dropped its veto on the plan. The funds will be available only to broadcasters and programme makers to help them upgrade equipment, convert existing programmes into the new wide-screen format, and produce new programmes. Funds will only be released if industry or public institutions come up with matching investment. Why is the deal important? EC equipment manufacturers, satellite and cable TV operators, broadcasters, programme producers and electronics retailers believe it should provide a new product to energise the depressed consumer electronics market. Politically, the deal represents the end of a year-long struggle to persuade sceptical member states, in particular Britain, to accept that EC funding for advanced television is justified. The 'action plan' is supposed to lead to high-definition cinema-quality television. Advocates, such as the French and Dutch governments and certain European Commission departments, believe HDTV will be particularly suited to films, sport and wildlife programmes. Some sceptics, however, think that consumers will be satisfied with ordinary or enhanced pictures on wide screens and the final, costly step will only be taken some time next century, if at all. But was not HDTV supposed to be the flagship of EC industry policy? High hopes were pinned on HDTV. When the idea was launched in the mid-1980s the EC tried to set exclusive satellite transmission standards in an attempt to gain a lead over the US and Japan. But a combination of bad luck, misjudgement and political disagreement meant satellite broadcasters were able to begin transmissions using different, normal-definition standards. The action plan - much amended over the last year - is now less a flagship than a lifeboat for the original strategy. How much has been spent so far on advanced television in Europe? Difficult to say, because cash has come from the industry, national governments and the EC. Recent studies suggest that at least Ecu625m was spent on developing a European HDTV system between 1986 and 1992. And what has been the result? Mixed. Technically, equipment manufacturers - in particular Thomson Consumer Electronics of France and Philips of the Netherlands - have come up with a working HDTV system based on the original standards backed by the EC. But there is no programming and, consequently, no mass market for such a system because commercial broadcasters have taken a different path. However, the action plan agreed yesterday is not tied to a particular technology. So what about Europe beating the Japanese and Americans? It is now more a case of 'if you can't beat them, join them'. The Japanese already have a working HDTV system, but its development is hampered by the high cost of sets - about Y1m (Pounds 6,000) apiece - and the scarcity and blandness of the programming. The US, meanwhile, has been running a contest for the best HDTV project using different technology, known as digital. The main contenders in that contest, including Philips and Thomson, are clubbing together to work on a single US digital HDTV standard. This was one reason why Britain refused to give its full support to the EC's plan based on existing analogue technology. What is so great about digital then? Digital technology can be broadcast from terrestrial transmitters as well as by satellite and cable, and it allows broadcasters to offer far more services on the same channel than the analogue technology backed by the EC and Japan. Digital television does not have to be high-definition. Europe is already preparing recommendations on digital standards, which will take into account work in the US and which could be ready by the end of the year. So what sort of television will European consumers be watching by the end of the century? Probably wide-screen, normal- or enhanced-definition pictures, perhaps broadcast digitally. Wide-screen sets are already available in continental Europe and were prominent at the television trade fair in Montreux last week. But the technology to create large, lightweight, flat-screen televisions is not yet ready for the market and the current sets are both bulky and expensive. Do I really need these expensive new gadgets? Probably not. But as advocates of wide-screen, cinema-quality television point out, it took a while for colour movies to catch on.</p>

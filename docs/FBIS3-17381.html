At a news conference after the ceremony the  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoliy Zlenko called it the fist  step to carry out the Rome agreement on the possible admission  of new countries to the European community.    In his opinion, in the near future the agreement will  "guarantee Ukraine political support and economic assistance in  its efforts to expand democracy and reform the economy on free  market principles."    Ukraine was the first CIS country to initial such a treaty.  Earlier the three Baltic states became associated members of the  European Union. Under the initialled document the two sides are  to carry out a set of measures to integrate Ukraine in the  community. Talks should begin in 1998 on Ukraine's membership  in a free trade zone.

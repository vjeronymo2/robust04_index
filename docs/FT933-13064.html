			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Leading Article: Rough justice WHEN THE history of Italy's corruption scandals comes to be written, Gabriele Cagliari may occupy a special place. In apparently killing himself in a Milan jail, the former ENI chairman has shone a grim light on the magistrates' ever-expanding investigations into links between politics and business. What is exposed is scarcely a picture of justice. Cagliari had been held for 133 days on a range of charges on which he could normally have expected bail. The magistrates are accused of trying to force him into self-incrimination. It is hard to escape the impression that what the Italian judiciary calls 'preventive detention' has become a severe infringement of citizens' rights. Hitherto, the widespread assumption has been that the vigorous means adopted by the magistrates were justified by the end: breaking the rotten system under which Italy has been governed for the last four decades. The question now is whether they have gone too far. To ask this is not to suggest systematic injustice: the people who have walked into the investigators' net are by admission almost all guilty of misdemeanours from making illegal party contributions to extortion. But the process still leaves an uncomfortable impression. It is being carried out amid a welter of press leaks that seem to presume guilt and offer suspects no public opportunity to defend themselves. Moreover, the magistrates' zeal in bringing accusations is not matched by an expeditious judicial system. Prosecutions can take 10 years to come to trial and, when they do, a staggering 75 per cent fail. At this rate, the courts will still be digesting current investigations long after many more of the culprits have died. The problem - for the magistrates as much as for their suspects - is that Italian justice is currently operating in a political vacuum. An entire system is on trial, not just a few hundred corrupt politicians and businessmen, and the current legislature is too discredited to come up with a workable political solution. This week's events merely reinforce the pressing need for fresh elections and comprehensive constitutional reform. But until a new parliament with such a mandate is in place, the judiciary will have to strike a more careful balance than it has of late between prosecuting the guilty and respecting the rights of the individual.</p>

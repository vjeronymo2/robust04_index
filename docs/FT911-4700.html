			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Company News: Solvay increases dividend as profits slip SOLVAY, the Belgian chemical group, yesterday announced a 5 per cent dip in net profits to BFr15.9bn (Dollars 463.5m) for 1990, but a BFr30 a share increase in its dividend to BFr500. Baron Daniel Janssen, executive chairman, said Solvay was bucking the trend among European chemical companies, which have tended to maintain or lower their dividends due to retained profits. It was insulated from the cyclical downturn for most of its products. Turnover was virtually unchanged, with 1990 sales amounting to BFr255bn. Mr Janssen blamed cheap PVC imports from eastern Europe, which was only just learning about market methods, and from the US, together with the difficulty of recouping the increased cost of ethylene inputs and austerity measures in Brazil, for the poorer performance of the group's plastics division. The group's largest product group remains alkalis, including chemical soda ash, of which Solvay is the world's largest producer. Mr Janssen said the EC's action last autumn in removing anti-dumping duties from imports of American soda ash, which is found naturally in Wyoming, would undoubtedly increase competition from the US. Mr Janssen, who summed up the company's philosophy as 'don't do much, but do it well', said expansion would be focused on pharmaceutical and health products, which had been Solvay's best performer last year. In the veterinary field, he cited a recent strategic alliance with Abbott Laboratories of the US. In terms of geographical diversification, Solvay is focusing on the US, Asia and central Europe. Solvay is negotiating with the Treuhandanstalt, the body responsible for privatising eastern Germany's industry, for the return of its Bernberg plant, seized by the Nazis in 1939. Yesterday it announced that it had, together with Wienerberger of Austria, acquired the polyethylene pipes division of Orbitaplast, near Leipzig in eastern Germany.</p>

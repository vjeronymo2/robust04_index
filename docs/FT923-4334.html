			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / UN seeks go-ahead for Sarajevo airlift UNITED Nations officials warned yesterday that suspension of relief flights into the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo threatened efforts to build up essential winter stockpiles of food, medicine, fuel and shelter materials. The airlift was suspended last Thursday after an Italian relief aircraft crashed near the Bosnian capital, killing all four crew. Mrs Sadako Ogata, UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, co-chairmen of the conference on the former Yugoslavia and representatives of the warring parties held urgent talks yesterday on how the airlift could be safely resumed. The UNHCR is seeking security assurances both for future flights and for deliveries of supplies on the ground. A UN warehouse in Sarajevo was shelled on Sunday in what appeared to be a deliberate attack. Mr Vance, representing the UN, and Lord Owen, for the European Community, plan to visit the region later this week, shortly before the deadline of midday next Saturday which they have set for Bosnian Serb forces to put heavy weapons around four cities under UN supervision. Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the co-chairmen, said the deadline was not an ultimatum but a 'nailing down' of the offer first made by Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of the Bosnian Serbs, at last month's London conference on the former Yugoslavia. Talk of sanctions if the deadline was not met was 'not in the spirit of what is going on', he said. Under the terms of the accord, Bosnian Serb forces will concentrate their heavy weapons around Sarajevo, Bihac, Jajce and Gorazde at declared sites where their use will be monitored by UN military observers. The deal covers tanks, multiple rocket launchers, 82mm mortars and field guns of 100mm calibre or more. The UN already monitors about half the heavy weapons around Sarajevo under an earlier accord that opened the airport for relief flights. The number of sites, now thought to be about eight, may rise to 10 or 11 under the new agreement. Mr Eckhard said the airport agreement had succeeded in reducing the amount of shelling suffered by the city, despite several tragic incidents. However, most of the remaining bombardment came from undeclared weapons sites in the hills to the east of the city away from the airport. Croatian forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina yesterday stepped up their attempts to consolidate their grip on occupied areas by threatening to expel Moslems living in the region, writes Judy Dempsey. The expulsion threat comes after months of mass deportations of Bosnia's Moslem community by Serb forces. It also comes in the wake of Croatian expulsions of ethnic Serbs living in Croatia. But the latest move by Croat forces indicates that Croatia and Serbia are determined to divide Bosnia leaving the Moslems, who make up 44 per cent of the 4.3m population, without a homeland.</p>

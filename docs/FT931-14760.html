			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Ministers rebuff editors THE STORM of press criticism that greeted the Calcutt report on press regulation was dismissed by the government yesterday as 'special pleading' as ministers underlined their determination to curb invasions of individual privacy. Senior ministers said the unanimous criticism by newspaper editors of the report prepared by Sir David Calcutt QC showed that the editors had seriously underestimated the mood at Westminster. Cabinet members known to take a liberal approach to the issue of press freedom joined more instinctively hostile colleagues in insisting that the government was determined to criminalise 'intrusive' behaviour by newspapers. Despite their rejection of Sir David's suggestion of a statutory press tribunal to replace the Press Complaints Commission, the ministers added that they were determined that voluntary regulation should have 'teeth' by making the commission more independent. The government signalled earlier this week that it would legislate against the use of trespass, bugging devices and other electronic equipment to intrude on individual privacy. The strength of feeling within the cabinet against the press, however, suggests that the promised 'public interest' defence which newspapers could offer in cases of prominent public figures might be narrowly drawn. Mr John Major, the prime minister, is keen to emphasise the government's concern with protecting the privacy of ordinary people. But ministers privately cite cases of the royal family, the resignation of Mr David Mellor, the former heritage secretary, and attacks on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, as instances of press coverage going too far. Mr Major is pressing for the new civil offence of invasion of privacy suggested by Calcutt. Ministers acknowledge, however, that without an expensive commitment to extend legal aid such a law could be exploited only by the affluent. Borrie joins MGN, Page 8 Weekend, Page XVIII</p>

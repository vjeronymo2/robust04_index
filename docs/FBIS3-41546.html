This year, the British Overseas Development Program will  help  Hainan draw up a plan to protect the environment in Haikou, the  island's capital. It will also train personnel and provide  equipment for environmental protection.    A German-aided sewage-treatment plant in Haikou is expected  to go into construction next year.    Located in a tropical region, Hainan has a land area of  34,000 sq km, with forest coverage of 40 percent. It also  boasts a coastline more than 1,500 km long. No other area in  China matches Hainan in terms of the abundance of animal, plant  and marine resources.    No large-scale development was launched until five years  ago,  when Hainan Province was founded.    Since then, the island has been faced with environmental  pollution, a drastic shrinkage of its forests and the  deterioration of the coastal marine ecological system.    Whether Hainan can avoid economic growth at the expense of  the environment, which most developed nations have experienced,  has become a focus of concern.    Martin Lees, former assistant secretary general of the  United  Nations, has cautioned the Chinese Government of the problem of  economic development and environmental protection. He said  Hainan should set an example for the world by combining economic  development with minimal damage to the environment.    With the help of UN organizations and other overseas  foundations, Hainan has hosted seminars on the environment  problem. In September of 1990, eight Chinese and eight  international experts formed an international advisory council  on the economic development of Hainan in harmony with the  environment.    The Asian development bank allocated 600,000 U.S. dollars to  work out a comprehensive plan for the administration of Hainan's  environment and natural resources early this year. According to  the plan, sewage-treatment plants will be built for a sugar  plant and a rubber plant, in addition to a garbage disposal  plant. A province-wide environmental monitoring network will  also be set up.</p>

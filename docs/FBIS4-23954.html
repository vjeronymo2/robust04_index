			<p>BFN     [Text] Lagos, June 17 (AFP) -- Nigerian leader General Sani  Abacha urged the Nigerian military on Friday [17 June] to  "distance themselves" from what he called "disruptive elements  within our society," the NEWS AGENCY OF NIGERIA (NAN) reported.    Abacha said at a passing-out ceremony of military students  Nigeria "must not continue to wallow in parochial loyalties  which have impaired the growth of a genuine and selfless  leadership."    Abacha, who was paying his first visit to Lagos since the  start of Nigeria's latest political crisis, said "every  patriotic Nigerian must see as highly reprehensible any unguided  acts capable of derailing the government's democratic process."    He said his administration could not be blackmailed into  abandoning the "noble cause" of establishing the foundation for  a lasting democracy in the country.    The general added that a constitutional conference,  scheduled  to open on June 27 in Abuja, was a "Nigerian conference by  Nigerians for Nigerians to discuss Nigeria's problems," NAN  quoted him as saying.    The opposition has dubbed the conference, which will last  three months, a "ruse" by the military to hang onto power.    Security in Lagos was beefed up Friday for Abacha's visit,  with groups of armed policemen stationed at strategic points,  NAN said.    Police Deputy Inspector General Nuhu Aliyu said security was  also tightened following a report that Moshood Abiola, the  presumed winner of presidential elections in June last year, was  going to address a meeting in Mushin, on the outskirts of Lagos,  to coincide with Abacha's visit.    The West African country has been in a state of crisis since  General Ibrahim Babangida, then head of the military junta,  annulled the June poll.    Abiola escaped a police dragnet last weekend and declared  himself president and commander-in-chief of Nigeria's armed  forces.    Aliyu alleged the millionaire politician had planned to  recruit local thugs, known as "area boys" to cause unrest during  the general's visit, NAN added.</p>

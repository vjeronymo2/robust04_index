			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / China investment flows surge Foreign investment is expected to continue flowing into China at an average annual rate of Dollars 15bn (Pounds 9.6bn) a year to the end of this century, according to the Development Research Centre of State Council, China's cabinet. Mr Zhang Xiaoji, the centre's deputy director of foreign economic relations, said that while this figure would mark a slowdown from the surge of 1993-95 it was 'still surprisingly high compared with many other countries'. China is now absorbing about one-third of direct foreign investment to developing countries worldwide, which reached Dollars 80bn last year. Direct overseas investment in 1993 of Dollars 26bn accounted for 13 per cent of total investment last year in China's fixed assets. This compared with an average throughout the 1980's of 2.5 per cent. But the numbers of new projects were down by 46 per cent to the end of September compared with last year, and pledged investment dropped by about 32 per cent to Dollars 57bn. Mr Zhang said indications of a slowdown this year were to be expected.</p>

			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / International Bonds: Ecu sector keeps pace with France and Germany THE ECU bond market, one of the beneficiaries of the shift of assets into European bond markets, has kept pace with France and Germany so far this year, despite a heavy supply of new issues. In January, the market absorbed over Ecu5bn of fixed-rate and floating-rate Eurobonds, compared with Ecu25bn for the whole of 1991, itself a record year. However, the current pace of activity is unlikely to be maintained. Indeed, signs that the market could face the same problems of oversupply which knocked it off its feet for much of last year would be most unwelcome. Uncertainty over the future of the currency may have been removed at Maastricht. But, from a technical point of view, the Ecu market has appeared expensive compared with its constituent bond markets since the Maastricht conference, prompting some concern about the market's continuing appeal. Ecu bonds trade at a yield around 60 basis points below the 10-year theoretical yield - that is, the weighted average of yield of each of the component bond markets. Some institutional investors have been eschewing the market, on the grounds that French franc or D-Mark bonds offer better value, or constituting their own Ecu baskets. However, many bond analysts expect the longer end of the yield curve to outperform short-dated Ecu bonds, assuming that European monetary union goes ahead as planned. Consequently, they believe the Ecu bond yield curve will become more inverted. However, this will largely depend on the performance of the underlying markets. Bonds maturing in 10 years or more will be redeemed after monetary union, which removes some of the currency risk for investors. There is a risk that bonds maturing in, say, five years could suffer from the devaluation of one of the component currencies ahead of monetary union. France's recent issue of 30-year Ecu bonds, under its OAT programme, has performed strongly, and is now yielding 8.36 per cent, less than the 10-year Ecu OAT. The UK's first issue of three-year Treasury notes has performed rather disappointingly, on the other hand, despite being bid very aggressively ahead of the auction last month. The yield on the UK Ecu note, from 8.48 per cent at the tender, has widened to 8.61 per cent, and dealers report a disappointing level of investor interest. Nevertheless, the three- and 30-year issues from France and the UK have provided a useful function in extending the yield curve. Last year, a flood of new issues, mainly by sovereign borrowers, in the first few months deluged the market, causing a substantial setback. Traders are hoping the same problems of oversupply will not recur this year, partly because many sovereign borrowers are instituting more regulated systems for tapping the market, in some cases via domestic auctions in their own markets. For example, Denmark and Belgium both plan to issue bonds in their domestic markets this year. The UK will be issuing through its T-note programme, while France will continue to supply the market through OAT issues. However, the investor base will still be the same as for Eurobond issues. In addition, a number of other sovereign issuers - Spain, Portugal and Norway, for example - may tap the market. The motivation for domestic issuance is based on self-interest as much as a desire to regulate the market: European financial centres are keen to attract Ecu trading business. For the moment, the bulk of Ecu bond trading is still conducted in London, but futures trading is based in Paris. The Matif, the French futures exchange, traded 5,000 Ecu bond futures contracts on Friday, compared with just 100 on the London International Financial Futures Exchange. However, the market is still driven by cash-market trading. Indeed, many dealers prefer to hedge trading positions through sovereign benchmark bonds, rather than the futures market, because of liquidity concerns. Competition in the market remains intense. Although still relatively small compared with government bond markets, it is a market which many banks feel they cannot afford to ignore. Yamaichi International, which became the 41st market maker in Ecu Eurobonds last month, yesterday launched an Ecu500m seven-year issue for Finland, priced to yield 8.45 per cent, which was considered the most aggressively priced deal so far this year. There is little outstanding paper in the seven-year area, but the deal was priced more tightly than Belgium's 9 1/8 per cent bonds due 1996, yielding 8.56 per cent, or the 9 1/2 per cent French OAT due 2000, yielding 8.50 per cent. Finland, which recently devalued its currency and was downgraded, is considered a declining credit. Yamaichi pointed to a European Community deal due 1998 yielding 8.30 per cent, but other dealers said that deal was trading very tightly. The deal closed at 99.60 bid, just below the fixed re-offered price, according to the lead manager.</p>

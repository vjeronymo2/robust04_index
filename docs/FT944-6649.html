			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / MPs leave sickbeds to support PM It was the most vivid indication of the government's despair. For the first time since the cliffhanger divisions over the Maastricht treaty, Tory MPs hobbled into the Commons from their sickbeds to save Mr John Major's administration, James Blitz writes. Under parliamentary rules, MPs cannot vote by proxy. They must walk through the division lobbies to have their votes counted. And amid continuing uncertainty about how many Tories would rebel, government whips realised they would have to bring out every last supporter to pass the European finance bill. Mr Julian Critchley, the MP for Aldershot, Hampshire, was wheeled into the chamber in a wheelchair, grinning at the Tory benches. Mr Geoffrey Dickens, the MP for Littleborough, braved serious illness to turn up for the vote. He stunned MPs on all sides by making a typically boisterous intervention shortly before the division, before engaging in a lengthy conversation with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. Another MP who went to trouble to support the prime minister was Mr Patrick Nicholls, who resigned as a Tory party vice-chairman last week after calling the French 'a nation of collaborators'. Mr Nicholls, the MP for Teignbridge, Devon, arrived wearing a neck brace after postponing an operation. Tory wags privately claimed that the MP, who did a round of pro-government interviews, was making amends for his gaffe. However, there were some absentees. Most notable was Sir Nicholas Fairbairn, the maverick MP for Perth and Kinross, who is thought to have stayed away while recovering from a virus.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PASSERS SHOW THEIR WINNING HANDS;  </P> <P> HART: CONTROVERSIAL ROB WESTERVELT SPEAKS HIS MIND AND UNDERMINES OPPOSING  DEFENSES.  </P> <P> Adjectives abound when the topic is Rob Westervelt.  </P> <P> To friends, Hart High's All-Southern Section quarterback, is talented,  tenacious, successful and a motivator.  </P> <P> To foes, Westervelt is cocky, mouthy, arrogant and a bit of a jerk.  </P> <P> Could be that Westervelt, an outspoken senior with shuffling feet, rifling arm  and jutting jaw is a bit of all of the above.  </P> <P> On the field, he commands the spotlight, sparring verbally with opponents,  sometimes locking face masks with teammates in an attempt to motivate, and  generally making his presence known.  </P> <P> "He is a very aggressive kid," first-year Coach Mike Herrington says. "He's  almost like a linebacker in a quarterback's body."  </P> <P> But Westervelt, 6-foot-3 and 210 pounds, stands tall in the pocket and isn't  bothered by the rush of conflicting opinions.  </P> <P> "I know what some people think, but I really don't care," he says. "If I cared  what they think, then maybe. . . . But if those people think that, then that's  fine. I'm sure they know I think of them the same way."  </P> <P> Form your opinion accordingly, but make no mistake about his worth. Westervelt  has proven himself as a leader and a winner. For the past two seasons, he has  been the Indians' unmistakable on-field chief, calling the signals, sometimes  calling the shots, while establishing himself as one of the state's best high  school quarterbacks.  </P> <P> "You don't want a kid that's passive," Herrington says. "You want to have a kid  that can take control. It can be overdone, but I don't think Rob's done that  this year."  </P> <P> Tonight, Hart (10-1) travels to Paramount for a 7:30 game in the second round  of the Southern Section Division III playoffs. Paramount (10-1) eliminated Hart  in the opening round last season en route to capturing the division  championship. But Westervelt, ever cocksure, insists that the outcome will be  different this time.  </P> <P> "I think," he says matter-of-factly, "that we're going to pound them."  </P> <P> When he isn't firing salvos, Westervelt is firing footballs. Last season, he  passed for 2,130 yards and 21 touchdowns. This season, he has thrown for 1,950  yards -- second to Alemany's Joey Rosselli among Valley quarterbacks -- with an  area-high 24 touchdowns.  </P> <P> His totals this season undoubtedly would be higher if not for the fact that he  has played only three full games and has spent the fourth quarter of several  blowouts on the bench.  </P> <P> He also endured a one-game suspension by school administrators for his  involvement in an on-campus fight ("He pushed me," Westervelt says, "and then I  thought, 'Oh my God, I'm going to kill this guy!' ").  </P> <P> On the field, Westervelt relishes the dirty work, charging up the middle on  impromptu quarterback sneaks or serving as lead blocker after pitching the ball  to a running back.  </P> <P> "He wants to play hard and get intense," Herrington says. "And he's not  intimidated by anyone. In fact, he tries to intimidate the other team."  </P> <P> Westervelt's point exactly.  </P> <P> "I jump up in the other guy's face," he says. "After I've yelled at them or  after I've hit them blocking, I want them to look over at me and say, 'Who the  hell is that?' They start yelling at me and then they go, 'If that's just their  quarterback, what about their other guys?' "  </P> <P> Westervelt has indeed put up, so why shut up? Well, he doesn't.  </P> <P> He unabashedly comments on anything -- players, coaches, rivals. While his  remarks might seem like a breath of fresh air to some, they might seem abrasive  to others -- especially those in his firing line.  </P> <P> Some samplings from The World According to Westervelt:  </P> <P> * On Canyon High, Hart's cross-town rival: "We hate Canyon, everything about  Canyon."  </P> <P> * On Canyon Coach Harry Welch, a noted disciplinarian: "He's a good coach, but  I just could not play for him. I can't put up with. . . . stuff like 'You're  running because you didn't do this right,' and treating me like a baby."  </P> <P> * On Crespi, Hart's lone conqueror this season: "That game was just a mental  letdown. If we played them again, we'd destroy 'em. By far."  </P> <P> * On teammates: "When there's a problem, I'm screaming. I feel like everyone  expects me to be the leader when there's a time to be a leader. I can tell when  there is a big problem and that it's not going to be solved by saying, 'You  shouldn't do this.' "  </P> <P> * On himself: "If I feel I'm going overboard, then I slow down. If the coach  says, 'Hey, Rob, knock it off,' I stop. When it's time to listen, I listen and  the coach has my full attention. I never talk back."  </P> <P> The flip side of Westervelt is one of a conciliatory and gracious competitor.  He credits teammates and praises opponents during postgame interviews. He is  modest and polite.  </P> <P> In the classroom, he maintains a 2.8 grade-point average, which, he says, he is  striving to improve to 3.0 to enhance his chances of landing a college  scholarship.  </P> <P> Several Division I colleges are interested in Westervelt, including Stanford,  Washington, San Diego State and numerous other West Coast schools.  </P> <P> "He's really a split personality," Barbara Westervelt says of her son. "He's  proud of himself. He's proud of his size and he's proud of the games that he's  had, and I think at times he wants to flaunt that.  </P> <P> "It's just a game to him. He really isn't the bad boy that everybody makes him  out to be. He's just a big stuffed animal at home."  </P> <P> Says Westervelt: "I'm not difficult to deal with. But when we start playing,  just the aggressiveness and the competitiveness comes out. I'm trying to  project that."  </P> <P> He has succeeded. While coaches and teammates are appreciative of his  contributions, they also note that sometimes, like a bad masseur, Westervelt  rubs the wrong way.  </P> <P> "A lot of the linemen don't appreciate the way he's loud," tight end Chad  Fotheringham said. "When Rob's on the field, he tries to take over everyone. It  never gets that bad. He knows exactly how far he can take it. He has to."  </P> <P> Says center Tim DeGroote: "He tries to get everybody up and he does it in a way  of yelling at you. We just take it that way, but sometimes he goes a little too  far."  </P> <P> Few words with Westervelt on the subject of restraint, however, have been  necessary, Herrington says. The quarterback has a leash, albeit a long one.  </P> <P> "Rob has crept over the boundaries a few times this year and we have to push  him back to make sure that he concentrates on his execution of the offense,"  Herrington says. "It's a case of just being able to channel the energy that he  has. But he's grown throughout the year as far as that goes."  </P> <P> Last season, Westervelt jousted with Hart Coach Dave Carson, whose play-calling  he openly criticized and sometimes overruled in the huddle. "He always thought  I tried to coach too much," Westervelt says. "I did. But somebody had to."  </P> <P> After posting six consecutive Foothill League titles, Hart fell to third place  last year with a 6-5 overall record. Carson, after only one season, was  unexpectedly forced to resign in July after repeated conflicts with school  administrators about his coaching and disciplinary methods.  </P> <P> Carson, who has remained at Hart as a teacher, was out of town this week and  unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Herrington, a Hart assistant from 1980-87, returned to the school after a  one-year stint at Bellflower High. Westervelt, under the tutelage of brothers  Rick and Dean Herrington, had passed for more than 2,800 yards as a sophomore.  </P> <P> Naturally, Westervelt was happy with the coaching change. But not with  everything.  </P> <P> "When the Herringtons came back," Barbara Westervelt says, "they said, 'Rob,  we're amazed at how many people hate you.' All that hurt Robby because none of  it's intentional. He said, 'Why would that be, Mom? What do I do to be hated by  people?'  </P> <P> "I think he's a little misunderstood and maybe he wants to be. He doesn't show  that it bothers him, but maybe inside it does."  </P> <P> Just don't count on Westervelt letting you know. His tongue may be sharp at  times, but his actions speak much louder than his words.  </P> <P> "He's doing exactly what we want him to do," Herrington says. "He's doing a  great job reading coverages and he's doing a great job running the ball and  blocking. That's what it boils down to, his performance."  </P></p>

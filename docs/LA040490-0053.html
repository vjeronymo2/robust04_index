			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GRIDLOCK AND PROPOSITION 111  </P> <P> If we vote for a higher gasoline tax for better roads, we are guaranteed that  the tax will stay around forever, but we are not guaranteed that the revenue  will be used for highways forever.  </P> <P> History has shown that, in many cases, a tax for a particular purpose ends up  in the general fund either directly or indirectly. What has happened to all the  past taxes that we were promised would be used to fix up the roads?  </P> <P> We, the voters, see government getting more inefficient at our expense. Until  we get guarantees for our money, we will be reluctant to vote for any new  taxes.  </P> <P> PAUL D. BLUMSTEIN  </P> <P> Rancho Palos Verdes  </P></p>

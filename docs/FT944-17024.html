			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Kuwaiti army puts on an unconvincing display: Troops look self-conscious The Kuwaiti army put on an unconvincing display of its military preparedness to scores of journalists taken to within 10km of Kuwait's northern border with Iraq yesterday. On a windless day with temperatures well into the 90s, there was little movement of any kind in the featureless desert from the Jahrah Ridge (site of the decimation of the retreating Iraqi army on the second-last day of Desert Storm in March 1991) up to the demilitarised zone (DMZ). Journalists were bussed 80km up the highway running north from Jahrah, 20kms west of Kuwait City, to two forward command posts, the nearest 5km from the DMZ. The zone runs the full length of the 207km Kuwait-Iraq border, extending 5km into Kuwait and 10km into Iraq. Some 20-30 of Kuwait's arsenal of 150-200 aged M-84 tanks could be seen spread out and occasionally dug in either side of the north-south highway from the Jahrah Ridge towards the border town of Abdali. One oil-field fire was burning and gas was being flared in the area of the Sabriya oilfield, part of the much larger Raudhatain Reservoir south of the border. Whole areas of desert were scarred by rusted metal and other waste typical of military activity and oil camps. At one spot beside the main road, Kuwait army spokesmen took special pride in pointing out what they said were the remnants of an Iraqi soldier's uniform, barely visible above the sand and long since shredded by sun and wind. Journalists were invited to photograph soldiers posing behind machine-guns mounted on pick-up trucks or atop an M-84, a re-designated version of the Soviet T-72 modified by the former Yugoslav army. Major General Ali al-Mumin, Kuwait's army chief-of-staff, said his men had experienced war on August 2, 1990 and in the subsequent liberation of Kuwait, and were in a state of 'highest alert'. Appearances can be deceptive. Still, those few troops visible looked more self-conscious, or in the case of the tank-crew, remarkably cool despite the heat and their cramped space, than alert or battle-hardened. But Gen al-Mumin maintained a brave face. He suggested the Iraqis facing him across the DMZ comprised three Republican Guard divisions numbering 50,000-60,000 men, an estimate some 20,000 less than the figure given on Sunday night by Sheikh Saud Nasser al-Sabah, Kuwait's information minister. Facing them are 20,000 Kuwaitis. Asked to justify his confidence in view of the Iraqi numerical superiority, Gen al-Mumin referred to the support given by 'our brothers-in-arms and our friends', a clear reference to US forces which he said would be arriving 'sooner than you think'. Many arrived in Kuwait on Sunday night. Brigadier General Salem al-Surour, army commander in the Abdali sector, said Kuwait's army would stay on full alert whatever the outcome of the debate in the UN Security Council. A more spontaneous reaction to Kuwait's military preparedness was given by an off-duty conscript who bluntly commented that were it not for the US forces, many Kuwaitis would have left for Saudi Arabia. Several journalists who had been with coalition forces during Desert Storm were equally negative in their comments on the army's seeming military unpreparedness. As though in recognition of this, the numbers of US reinforcements due to arrive in Kuwait have increased to some 18,000 marines plus thousands of extra ground troops from the Rapid Deployment Force attached to the US Central Command. These extra troops are in addition to the several thousand already in Kuwait. The military confrontation with Iraq has been blurred by the arrival of several thousand 'stateless' Bidoon who have pitched some 6,000 tents on Iraq's side of the border in the port city of Umm Qasr. Described by Kuwait as 'Iraqi soldiers in civilian clothes', it is expected they will be encouraged by Iraq to hold 'demonstrations' to draw attention to their 'plight', to embarrass the Kuwaiti government.</p>

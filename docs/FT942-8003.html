			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Commercial break-up? - Advertising prospects in an interactive age The world's first television advertisement appeared on NBC's WNBT channel in New York on July 1, 1941. It showed a Bulova clock ticking, lasted 20 seconds, and cost Dollars 9. A little more than half a century later, television advertising in the US is a Dollars 30bn-a-year industry, and it is hard to imagine life without the commercial break. Yet that is the prospect that haunts Ed Artzt, chairman and chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products giant. At a gathering of advertising agency leaders in West Virginia this month, Artzt shocked his audience by asking: 'What if there is no place for traditional television advertising in the new media age?' For Artzt, the answer is of more than academic interest. Procter &amp; Gamble is not only the world's biggest advertiser, but spends nearly 90 per cent of its Dollars 3bn-a-year advertising budget on television commercials. The loss of such a powerful promotional tool could have unthinkable consequences for the company. But why the alarm? Can there really be any prospect that television advertising is going to disappear? If media prophets are right, television is set to change radically over the next few years. Mass broadcasting to a passive audience will be replaced by hundreds of viewer-controlled interactive channels that will give people the information or entertainment they want, on demand. The danger for advertisers is that, even supposing there is a place for commercials in this new era, people will prefer to watch (or interact with) the channels that do not show them. US advertising agencies argue that this is an over-simplification. Not surprisingly, they like to see interactive television as an opportunity rather than a threat. For example, they say, imagine someone wanting to buy a new car. The viewer of the future might welcome the opportunity to tune into a special channel featuring nothing but car advertisements  - particularly if he or she could conduct a dialogue with the screen, asking for more information about performance or safety features of different models. The same could apply to household appliances, electronic goods, or any other sort of purchase where consumers want to make an informed choice. Other advertising opportunities would become available on channels specialising in sports and hobbies. Viewers of a golfing channel, for example - just like readers of a golfing magazine - would welcome advertisements telling them what products were available and where they could buy them. Similarly, a fashion channel equivalent of Vogue magazine could be crammed with advertisements for clothing and cosmetics. This, however, does not answer Artzt's question. Where are advertisements for Procter &amp; Gamble's products going to appear five years from now? Viewers will not want to tune into a special channel featuring interactive advertisements for Fairy washing-up liquid; nor will they expect their golfing programmes to be interrupted with advertisements for Tide. According to Barry Linsky, senior vice president for planning and business development at the Interpublic group of advertising agencies, the gloom is overdone. True, he says, there are likely to be a lot of pay-per-view channels without advertising in the interactive future. But there is no evidence to suggest that viewers are prepared to pay significantly more for their entertainment than they do today, so most programming will continue to be supported by advertisements. Prof Nicholas Negroponte, director of the Media Lab at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, disagrees. Theoretically, he points out, if manufacturers were no longer paying for television advertising, their products would become proportionally cheaper, so consumers would have more money to spend on home entertainment. More significantly, Negroponte points to a future where programming is indeed still supported by advertisements - but advertisements aimed directly at the individual. For example, people using their interactive screens to book a salmon-fishing holiday in Scotland might switch on a baseball game the next day to find themselves watching advertisements for outdoor clothing or fly-fishing equipment in the commercial break. Over time, interactive television would build up such accurate profiles of individuals from their viewing and buying habits that every advertisment would be individually tailored to meet their wants and needs. One commercial might suggest you book a table at Lutece for your wedding anniversary tomorrow; another could recommend a Hermes tie to match that shirt you bought last week; a third might remind you that you usually change your car around this time, and suggest you look at the new Lexus. And so, yet again, Artzt's question comes back: where does that leave Procter &amp; Gamble? Or for that matter, Coca-Cola, or Colgate-Palmolive, or Kelloggs, or all those other manufacturers of hum-drum packaged goods that rely so heavily on repetitive advertising to support their brands? Well, you could always pay people to watch their commercials, says Keith Reinhard, chairman and chief executive of the advertising agency DDB Needham Worldwide. He isn't joking. You could have machines on top of the television set that would reward people for watching advertisements by printing out money-off coupons. Or you could offer people a choice of viewing: watch the movie for Dollars 3 with the commercials or Dollars 5 without them. 'Maybe people will go to the washroom while some of the commercials are playing,' says Reinhard. 'But we've always had that problem - how to keep viewers engaged.' Another possibility is a return to 1950s-style advertiser - supplied programming, where one company or one brand supports an entire programme. Procter &amp; Gamble has been sponsoring daytime 'soaps' - domestic dramas - in the US since the beginning of commercial TV, which explains their name. Even so, Negroponte maintains that he cannot imagine any context where he would want to see a Tide commercial in the interactive world. If he is right, the consequences could be devastating for sales of everyday branded goods. Negroponte's advice? 'I think if I was Procter &amp; Gamble, I'd be buying billboard space,' he says. 'A lot of it.'</p>

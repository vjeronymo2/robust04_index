			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / International Company News: Zeigler Coal plans public offering Zeigler Coal, the fourth largest US coal company, has applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 10.6m shares in an initial public offering. The company said it planned to sell the shares for between Dollars 15 and Dollars 17. The timing of the offering was not disclosed. The company plans to use the proceeds to reduce debt and increase its ability to acquire new coal properties and develop new mines on existing reserves. Illinois-based Zeigler produces about 40m tons of coal annually, with mining operations in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, West Virginia and Wyoming. The company has expanded rapidly since 1990, acquiring the coal assets of BP America in 1990, and of Shell Oil Company in 1992. Zeigler said it recorded first-quarter net income of Dollars 6.3m on sales of Dollars 220.1m. Analysts said the Zeigler shares would offer a rare 'pure coal' opportunity for investors. The leading US coal companies are held by conglomerates and their shares are not traded independently of their parent companies. US coal companies have not shared in the strong performance of other commodities-based businesses this year. Labour unrest and clean air regulations have battered the industry, leaving only the strongest companies - with long-term sales contracts with large utilities - in profitable positions.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / UK Company News: London Forfaiting declines to Pounds 7.34m London Forfaiting, the specialist trade finance group, yesterday reported a 30 per cent drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.5m to Pounds 7.34m for the first half of the year. The company blamed volatile conditions in the eurobond market, particularly in the emerging markets, for the downturn. Trading income declined 5.5 per cent to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 15.5m), while earnings per share fell from 8.03p to 5.33p. The interim dividend is maintained at 3.2p. Mr Jack Wilson, chairman, said that the core export finance business, which is involved in making fixed-rate loans, had performed well. In particular, the eastern European export market had turned up, and the company was continuing to see good returns from its financing of European exports to Asia and South America. To this end, the group had opened an office in Stockholm to tap the Swedish export finance market. The transferable loans business was another bright spot. New loans worth more than Dollars 1bn had been arranged so far this year for Asian borrowers. These included London Forfaiting's first foray into the Japanese market with a Dollars 100m transferable loan for Takefuji Corporation. There was also a Dollars 170m floating note facility for a Bangkok bank. More than 80 per cent of the company's revenues are earned overseas. However, Mr Wilson said that the continuing uncertain bond market conditions made it impossible to give a prediction on current trading. The fall in profits had been well flagged by the company, which had warned at the annual results of tough trading conditions, but came in ahead of market expectations. The shares climbed 11p to 175p.</p>

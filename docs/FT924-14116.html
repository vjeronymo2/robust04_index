			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Rabin threatens to crush unrest: Jerusalem fears stepped-up intifada may derail peace talks The Israeli government, worried that a surge of unrest in the occupied territories might derail Middle East peace talks, yesterday warned Palestinians that Israeli troops would use all their strength to suppress unrest in the occupied territories. 'The Palestinians must understand that the solution to their problems will be around the negotiating table, not in the streets and alleyways of the territories,' Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said during a visit to the Gaza Strip. Troops would use 'all our strength' to suppress Palestinian unrest. At least two Palestinians, one a boy aged 14 and an Israeli settler, were killed over the weekend, and more than 100 injured in the West Bank and Gaza. The clashes with security forces are similar to the widespread rioting which characterised the early days of the near-five-year-old intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule. The demonstrations erupted in support of a hunger strike staged by many of the 12,000 Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, protesting at conditions in the prisons. Mr Rabin said he was ready to improve conditions. But Israeli officials accused opponents and supporters of the peace talks on the Palestinian side of exploiting the protest. They said opponents wanted to disrupt the year-old negotiations, which are due to resume in Washington on October 21, while supporters were trying to put pressure on Israel. The authorities are afraid of a sustained resurgence of the intifada. 'We are worried,' said a Rabin aide. 'This can undermine the whole peace process.' The unrest reflected frustration in the occupied territories that the talks have so far produced nothing tangible. One Palestinian lawyer said: 'Feelings are running very strong on the prison issue because almost everyone has a family member in jail. The street has taken over again; our peace negotiators cannot control it.'</p>

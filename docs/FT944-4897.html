			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint):  UK tenancy reform lacks incentives for landowners - Without fiscal changes opportunities for new entrants to agriculture may remain few and far between Opportunities for young people in any industry are universally regarded as 'a good thing'. New blood brings new ideas that also stimulate those already involved. Farming is no exception, and one of the means by which this may be encouraged is through the availability of farms to rent. By relieving the new entrant of the requirement to purchase land it offers a relatively low cost way of getting a start. I started that way myself, renting my first farm, on which I still live, when I was 20. It was fairly commonplace for a young man to be able to rent a farm in the late 1950s. But subsequent legislation and developments designed to avoid its provisions have brought about radical changes in the UK; and today few new farm tenancies are arranged. So the announcement in the Queen's speech that a Tenancy Reform Bill to address the problem and encourage landowners to let more land would be presented during this session of parliament was, on the face of it, very good news. Indeed, the government and the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors forecast that the reform, when enacted, would lead to 1m acres more farmland becoming available for rent. Sadly, I fear their estimates are wildly optimistic and that, short of fiscal reform, only a few new tenancies will be created. Before 1947 most UK farmland was owned by one group - landowners - and farmed by another - tenants, through a variety of legal agreements. These were usually written in favour of landowners and it was not unusual for tenants to be evicted, without compensation for improvements, at the whim of the owner. In 1947, as part of a wide-ranging Agricultural Act, Mr Tom Williams, the Labour agriculture minister, introduced life-time security of tenure for tenant farmers. The prospect of losing control of their land for many years together with the ability to sell it, if necessary, at the enhanced price available with vacant possession, reduced the number of tenancies being offered. But the supply did not dry up altogether, as I found in 1958. In 1976, however, another Labour government brought in security of tenure for three farming generations, provided certain succession criteria were met. It was a measure that had been introduced in Scotland some years earlier. It raised the possibility that, if they entered into new tenancy agreements, landowners might lose control of their farms for up to 100 years. The immediate effect was a refusal by landowners to be so hamstrung and to an extention of the established policy of taking any farms which came vacant 'in hand' - that is farming the land themselves. Not all landowners were successful at farming, however, and a variety of arrangements developed whereby owners could derive income from their land without having to do the job themselves, but also without creating undesireable tenancies. In some cases land agents were retained to control managers employed by owners. Various forms of share-farming were introduced, with the owner entering into limited partnership arrangements with local farmers or their sons. Contract farming deals were devised that included full management of the farm by the contractor and guaranteed landowners a rental equivalent income as well as a share of the profit after costs. Some cashed in on the Gladstone v Bower case, which by judicial ruling allowed a licenced tenancy to run for up to five years without creating a full tenancy. Furthermore, the owners who entered into contract arrangements, usually for three years, which has now emerged as the most widespread and popular way round the present law, also qualify to be taxed under Schedule D rather than having to pay higher rates when receiving rents, which count as unearned income; they are the farmers so can reclaim much of their VAT; and as owner-occupiers their heirs qualify for inheritance tax relief not available to the owners of let land. In his budget last week the chancellor did nothing to change those owner-occupational benefits. It seems to me, therefore, that little has changed, or will change, when the Tenancy Reform Bill becomes law next year. The new arrangements for which the Bill provides, which have been thrashed out over several years by the National Farmers' Unions, the Country Landowners Association, the Tenant Farmers' Association and the National Federation of Young Farmers' Clubs contain many sensible and practical ideas. There is recognition, for instance, of the desires of both parties for flexibility. So, no minimum term for tenancies has been set and there will be more freedom on the uses to which the land is put. For the protection of tenants there will be mandatory compensation for improvements; provision for independent arbitration to settle disputes; effective procedures for notice to quit and a check on rent increases. All are workable, but without the extra incentive to the landowner that taxation reform would have provided I doubt the package will prove attractive to many. I should declare an interest, as a non-executive director of one of the farm management companies involved in a great deal of the type of contract farming I have described. But I can see few reasons, other than altruism, why landowners should decide to give up those significant tax benefits plus a profit share, for which they qualify under a contract farming arrangement, in order to let their land under one of the proposed farm business tenancies.</p>

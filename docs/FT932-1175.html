			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Survey of France (6): Aux armes, citoyens] - Paris and the provinces PARISIANS 'should realise the French provinces are not Kamtchatka or the Kalahari desert,' President Mitterrand said recently when he was inaugurating the TGV high speed rail link from the French capital to Lille. He was commenting on the guerrilla tactics employed by large parts of the national civil service in resisting government efforts to shift them from Paris, in the interest of reducing congestion in the capital and increasing employment in the rest of the country. The war between Paris and the provinces goes back at least two centuries, to the French revolution. First, the Girondins tried to reduce the predominance of Paris over the provinces, only to be succeeded by the Jacobins, who then centralised the French state more than the Bourbon kings had ever succeeded in doing. The most serious attempt to push the pendulum back came only in 1982-83. Regions were then given a real responsibility for their own economic development, and some real money (largely from car and property taxes) to carry it out. But 10 years of supposed regionalisation has done nothing to diminish the relative weight of Paris in the economy. The Ile de France region, in which Paris is situated, is still home to 30 per cent of the country's university students, 40 per cent of its managers, 42 per cent of all its offices, 60 per cent of its researchers and 78 per cent of the headquarters of France's top 200 companies. Recent Socialist governments decided on a more dirigiste solution. During her year (1991-92) as prime minister, Mrs Edith Cresson announced a plan to send 15,000 civil servants out of Paris by 1996 - and double that number by the end of the century. Two years later only about 2,000 have departed the capital, grumbling about the extra cost and time spent in commuting back to Paris. Certain institutions have not taken their exile from Paris lying down. The most notable among these has been the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (ENA), the fount of France's civil service elite. ENA was ordered to Strasbourg by Mrs Cresson (not herself a former enarque), where it is being re-housed in a former prison. But ENA's influential association of former pupils challenged the decision. Earlier this month the Conseil d'Etat, the country's highest administrative court, ruled that Mrs Cresson had not followed the proper procedure in moving the school to Alsace. But ENA's old boys reckoned without one of their number. Prime Minister Edouard Balladur has decided to risk the wrath of his patron, Mr Jacques Chirac (enarque and mayor of Paris) and uphold Mrs Cresson's decision. To be sure, he could do no less without emptying of all content his pledge for a new regional planning policy. The Paris lobby is stronger than ever in the new government. No fewer than eight ministers are elected from the Paris area. They include Mr Balladur himself; Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister who also holds (as French politicians are allowed to do) the presidency of the Ile de France regional council; and Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister who also presides over the nearby Hauts de Seine department. But Mr Balladur's partner in coalition  -the UDF - strongly favours more regionalisation; this Girondist tendency in the UDF is one of the characteristics which distinguishes it most from the more Jacobin RPR, the neo-gaullist party of Mr Balladur and Mr Chirac. More important, Mr Balladur knows that most of the elements in his regional policy are passive - such as putting a freeze on the closure of public services and the opening of new supermarkets in the countryside. Other policies, too, are narrowing his options in regional policy. Planned defence cuts - which in 1994 involve demobilising 10,000 soldiers, closing a garrison in Limoges, shutting down the submarine base in Lorient in Brittany  -have raised a minor furore among local politicians. His privatisation programme, too, reduces the number of state employees which the government can direct to the provinces. The Conseil d'Etat, for instance, raised the same administrative objection to shifting Seita, the state tobacco making monopoly, from Paris to Angouleme. But since Seita is now on the privatisation list, it will presumably be eventually allowed to decide for itself where it wants to sit. And what, one might ask, is the point of the French state pouring money into fast transport if it cannot exploit (say) the new TGV link from Paris to Lille by putting the national patent office in the provincial city?</p>

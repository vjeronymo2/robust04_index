			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Konstantin Pribytkov] </F>   [Text] Geneva June 2 TASS -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan  Karadzic thinks that the U.N. promoted ceasefire talks on  Bosnia- Herzegovina, which were scheduled to be held today, can  be held in Geneva on Friday [3 June]. In an exclusive interview  with ITAR- TASS, Karadzic expressed the hope that a ceasefire  agreement can be signed at these talks. "The Serbs, Karadzic  said, "have been seeking such an agreement for the past two  years."    The talks were cancelled virtually a few minutes before  their  scheduled opening today. A decision to this effect was made by  special U.N. secretary-general's envoy in Yugoslavia Yasushi  Akashi. He motivated his step by the Bosinan Serbs' failure to  fulfil their obligation to withdraw troops from a 3-km zone  around the Moslem enclave of Gorazde. Commenting on the  situation in Geneva, the Bosnian Serb leader said that the  Moslem side has once again succeeded in avoiding the talks.    The Serb leader surmised that the complications, which have  cropped up regarding the reported arrival of Serb units in the  vicinity of Gorazde, can be settled.    The Serb delegation intends to take part in the "contact  group" session on Bosnia of which diplomats of Russia, United  States, Great Britain, Germany and France are members. The  session, to which the Moslems and the Croats are also invited,  is scheduled to be held in the French mission in the European  department of the U.N. It will resume discussions, which had  begun at the previous similar meeting held in the French city of  Talloires at the end of May. The Serb delegation will be led by  Momcilo Krajisnik, chaiman of the parliament of the republic  proclaimed by the Bosnian Serbs.</p>

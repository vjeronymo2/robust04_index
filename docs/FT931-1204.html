			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / Survey of Bangladesh (2): Pointscoring in a democratic consensus - Khozem Merchant traces the rivalry between the two women who dominate the political arena celebrating the end of the day's Ramadan fast - became a game of political pointscoring. The winner was Khaleda Zia, the prime minister. Against all expectations, Mrs Zia attended the party hosted by her arch rival Sheikh Hasina, leader of the opposition Awami League. The local press described Mrs Zia's move as a victory of statesmanship over petty-mindedness, an act it hoped would help to reconcile the two. For 18 months they had spurned each other's invitations, issued more out of political nicety than affection. 'From my side I have no rivalry (with her). I do not know about her,' says the prime minister. However, genuine reconciliation may be a long way off. The two leaders dominate their parties and domestic politics. The tendency, according to a western diplomat, is for the opposition to be preoccupied with Mrs Hasina's personal battles and for the government to be constantly on the defensive and unable to define a clear strategy for the future. Mrs Zia and Mrs Hasina entered politics as standard bearers respectively for their murdered husband (President Zia ur Rahman) and father (Sheikh Mujib ur Rahman, who led the struggle for an independent Bangladesh). 'Both the women hark back to the events surrounding the creation of the state 22 years ago,' says a foreign diplomat. Mrs Hasina, for instance, is determined to repeal the indemnity given to her father's killers. It is these historical issues which divide the ruling Bangladesh National Party and the Awami League. Their aggressive partisanship hinders consensus on pressing problems, such as the economy on which the two parties claim common ground. Though Mrs Zia continues to invoke the spirit of her husband, recalling for instance his '19-point economic plan' - a vague strategy which lacked substance - she insists she is her own person. 'I am a different personality (than my husband) and developed my policies during nine years of the autocratic Ershad regime.' General Hossain Ershad, who seized power in 1982, resigned in December 1990 in the face of opposition protests and student demonstrations. Mr Ershad was arrested and tried on charges of illegal possession of arms and abuse of power. He was sentenced to 10 years' imprisonment. Mrs Zia came to power after winning the country's first free elections in February 1991. The prime minister is trying to escape the past. In recent months she has toured rural areas, addressing crowds of up to 500,000. 'She is trying to shift the political ground. She is raising very important issues such as poverty, education and illiteracy at a critical time,' says Talukder Maniruzzaman, a political scientist at Dhaka university. With the government under intense pressure to implement a tough World Bank programme, Mrs Zia needs to sell it to the people. Her speeches in the countryside are also enabling her to widen her political support. Urban critics have always accused her of being out of touch with the people because of her 'cantonment culture', a reference to her life in the barracks as the wife of a soldier. However, as Professor Maniruzzaman says: 'The government is drifting. She has not been spectacularly successful but she sets the tone of government. There is a logic in her approach. Her intentions are good. She emphasises development.' The sense of drift is partly explained by inexperience. Only five of her 40-member cabinet had ministerial experience when appointed. Few capable candidates are waiting in the wings. The majority of the 1991 parliamentary intake were political novices, newly-rich businessmen. In any case, the prime minister is loyal to her friends. Her real accomplishment has been to sustain the momentum behind the transition to democracy. The press speaks its mind and the Jatiya Sangsad, the parliament, though lacking some of the sharper skills of democratic politics, functions well. Both main parties are committed to parliamentary democracy. Nobody is knocking at the army's door. The army is content. Its refusal to bail out General Ershad was an important turning point for the military. Today, the army believes its interests are broadly served by Mrs Zia's brand of Bangladeshi nationalism and commitment to Islam. Mrs Zia's other accomplishment has been to strengthen her position within the BNP. Among cabinet colleagues, she alone enjoys national support. Though some ministers, such as Mr Saifur Rahman at finance, are acknowledged to be doing a good job, they scarcely represent a challenge to Mrs Zia. Nor is she under threat from other traditional quarters. Students, who played a critical role in forcing Ershad's downfall, have been largely tamed. The Jamaat-e-Islami, the radical Islamic party, enjoyed brief influence after the election by supporting the BNP and giving it an overall majority. But with the appointment of 30 nominated women members to parliament - most allied to the BNP - the parliamentary wing of the Islamic party has been sidelined. The Jamaat-e-Islami's influence is mostly confined to local politics where its powerful cadre and organisational strength ensures it a strong voice in by-elections. The Awami League is seen by political observers as enfeebled, its attacks confined to personalities and rarely on issues of substance. The party lacks a coherent strategy and is internally divided. Sheikh Hasina needs to think afresh. She may start by revising the guest list for this week's Eid party marking the end of Ramadan.</p>

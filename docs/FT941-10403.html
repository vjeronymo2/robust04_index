			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Rate cuts rewarded in Belgium, Norway Rate cuts were rewarded in Brussels and Oslo, but bourses lost some of their early gains as Wall Street moved to marginal weakness in the American mid-morning, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT's Dax index rose 27.81, or 1.3 per cent, on the session to 2,107.21, but most of this reflected Monday's post-bourse gains. Turnover fell from DM10.8bn to DM9.8bn. The Ibis-indicated Dax closed the afternoon just 4.46 ahead at 2,099.57. 'The only high we had today was in the jobless figures,' mourned Mr Edgar Benischek, head of trading at Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt. Mr Benischek said that Mr Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, seemed determined that the D-Mark should not depreciate against the US dollar and that interest rate prospects were weakened accordingly. Not enough companies were producing an improving picture at the moment, he said, although Degussa, which was an early cost cutter, came up with good results yesterday and saw its shares rise DM13 on the session, to DM467. PARIS turnover slipped below the FFr5bn level as many investors decided to take a watching brief. The CAC-40 index closed 12.79 higher at 2,299.85, off the day's high of 2,318.00. Roussel Uclaf, the pharmaceuticals group, rose FFr28 to FFr724 on better than expected 1993 results, assisted by good sales growth in the fourth quarter. Paribas recently recommended a continued underweight position in the sector, given that prices could come under greater pressure in the short term. It did recommend Roussel however, noting that its position will be enhanced further by restructuring. Eurotunnel went in the opposite direction, down FFr1.85 to FFr50.15 after announcing that the May 8 opening of the passenger service could be delayed. AMSTERDAM was lifted by activity, particularly from UK and US investors, among the heavily capitalised issues. The AEX index rose 8.11 or 1.9 per cent to 436.54. Nedlloyd added 10 per cent on a positive profit forecast for 1994, the shares gaining Fl 7.00 to Fl 76.60. The group also said that it was launching a Fl 300m convertible bond which would be used to repay debt. MILAN recovered on domestic and foreign buying, the Comit index rising 12.87 or 1.9 per cent to a year's high of 677.75. Fiat companies benefited as investors, trying to rebuild positions, met a dearth of sellers. Fiat rose L173 or 3.6 per cent to L4,963 and Ifil added L336 or 5.4 per cent to L6,544 amid renewed speculation that it might sell all or part of its Rinascente stake. Rinascente gained L569 or 6 per cent to L10,047. The banking sector continued to receive support from the success of the IMI privatisation and plans to force any group taking controlling blocks in privatised banks to launch a public offer. Credito Italiano rose L131 or 5.2 per cent to L2,691 and BCI L195 or 3.7 per cent to L5,486. IMI, making its debut on the bourse today, was quoted at L12,500-L13,000 on the grey market yesterday, compared with the offer price of L10,900. ZURICH encountered late profit-taking and the SMI index finished 7.4 ahead at 3,097.2 after a high of 3,140.3. Chemicals, however, held on to the best of their gains, Roche certificates adding SFr110 to SFr7,180 and Ciba registered SFr15 to SFr920. Banks, recently firm, were out of favour: CS Holding dipped SFr9 to SFr730 and UBS bearers dipped SFr8 to SFr920. Alusuisse put on SFr16 to SFr624 as it forecast improved 1994 profits. MADRID closed off its highs, but the general index still rose 4.81 to 353.98 in active turnover of Pta49.5bn. Electrical utilities were the strong feature, after weakness in banks and construction on Monday. BRUSSELS parlayed Monday's bank rate cut, and its relative strength that day, into a new record high, the Bel-20 index ending 8.49 higher at 1,535.60 with basket trading again strongly in evidence. OSLO rose in anticipation of a rate cut which came after hours, the all-share index closing 14.63, or 2.2 per cent higher at 683.59. General optimism was also reported ahead of tomorrow's string of 1993 results. HELSINKI gained 2.3 per cent with banks and forestry in the lead, the Hex index closing 44.2 higher at 1,943.6. DUBLIN rebounded after Monday's 3.4 per cent slide, as the market was encouraged by the interest rate developments in London. The ISEQ index added 46.29 or 2.3 per cent to 2,023.32. ISTANBUL fell back more than 6 per cent as investors continued to transfer funds into money markets to take advantage of high interest rates. The composite index lost 1,131.16 to 17,081.15.

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Kemper settles case with Dollars 9.75m payment KEMPER Financial Services, the Chicago-based money management group, has agreed to pay Dollars 9.75m to shareholders in two of its mutual funds. The move is to settle complaints that a Kemper portfolio manager deposited winning futures and options trades into a profit-sharing fund that benefited Kemper employees, and assigned unprofitable trades to the publicly-held mutual funds. Kemper Financial, which is part of the Kemper Corporation insurance and financial services concern, has agreed to settle the complaints without admitting or denying the allegations. Kemper Financial manages funds of Dollars 72bn. At the time of the questionable trades, in 1987, it had Dollars 45bn under management. Mr Charles Kierscht, Kemper Financial chairman, said the company decided to settle the case in order to resolve all outstanding issues in the matter without the costs and distractions involved in litigation. The settlement satisfies administrative complaints against the company by the Securities Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, as well as parties to a class action lawsuit filed against the company by shareholders in the two mutual funds. The settlement will be paid into an account that will benefit mutual fund investors.</p>

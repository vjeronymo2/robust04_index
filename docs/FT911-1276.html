			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / The improved competitiveness of the US THE STAGNANT state of the US economy has been uppermost in the minds of US economic policy-makers in recent months - but not all the recent economic news has been bad. The US current account deficit has shrunk over the past year - to 1.8 per cent of gross national product in 1990 from 3.6 per cent in 1986 - easing fears that US companies can no longer compete effectively on world markets. The driving force behind the fall in the US deficit, and the contraction of the Japanese and German current account surpluses, is illustrated in the chart below. The international price competitiveness of US goods in world markets, measured by the US real exchange rate, has improved markedly over the past five years. This remains true despite the dollar's recent appreciation. These and other trends in inflation, earnings and competitiveness in the world's six largest industrial countries are apparent in this week's fifth and final table in the FT's new series of international economic indicators. The most widely used indicator of inflation in all economies is the annual percentage increase in an index of consumer prices. This index measures changes in the prices of a basket of goods and services bought by an average consumer in each country. While inflation is on a downward path in the US and UK, the reason for the Bank of Japan's nervousness over inflation is clear. The annual rate of inflation in Japan has increased from 2.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1990 to 3.7 per cent in February. In west Germany, by contrast, inflation has eased, despite the Bundesbank's fears about inflation. The rate of producer or 'factory gate' price inflation may provide a more reliable guide to underlying inflationary pressures. As consumer price indices often include indirect taxes or mortgage interest costs, a tighter fiscal or monetary policy, designed to reduce inflation, tends to increase consumer price inflation in the short-term. In the UK, for example, retail price inflation has fallen sharply since November of last year, owing to falls in mortgage interest rates and petrol prices. Yet the rate of producer price inflation has risen over the same period. With the growth rate of average earnings stuck around 9 per cent, UK manufacturers appear to have been trying to pass increased wage costs on to consumers, despite depressed consumer demand. The fall of 0.7 percentage points in the annual increase in the earnings index since its peak last July results largely from a reduction in overtime working. Movements in the real purchasing power of wages in different countries can only be assessed by looking at the earnings and consumer price indices together. Nominal earnings in the US rose by 14 per cent between 1985 and 1990, for example, but consumer prices rose by 21.5 per cent. As a result average real earnings in the US fell by 6.2 per cent in real terms, but they grew by 10.7 per cent in Japan and 14.9 per cent in west Germany over the same period. While both real wages and average earnings have grown faster in Japan than in the US since 1985 the average domestic cost of labour per unit of output has remained roughly constant in both countries. The reason for this is that the average productivity of Japanese workers has grown faster than that of US workers. Meanwhile, domestic unit labour costs in west Germany have risen by 10 per cent since 1985. Relative growth of unit labour costs between countries are an indicator of the competitiveness of industries producing internationally traded goods. If a country's nominal exchange rate is fixed but unit labour costs in the production of traded goods rise faster than those abroad, its goods will become less competitive on world markets. Equally, if the domestic unit labour costs in the production of traded goods rise at the same rate as those abroad, a rise in the country's nominal exchange rate will have the same effect: the production of exports and substitutes for imports becomes less profitable and trade performance deteriorates. The real exchange rate series in the table combines these two determinants of price competitiveness - changes in nominal exchange rates and in relative unit labour costs. A rise in the real exchange rate indicates a fall in competitiveness. The depreciation of the US real exchange rate since 1985 is the product of these two effects - the depreciation in the dollar exchange rate since its 1985 peak and the lower rate of inflation of US unit labour costs in dollars than of European labour costs in European currencies. Together these explain the encouraging performance of US export volumes in recent years and have contributed to the contraction of the US current account deficit. The FT has already published the following tables: National Accounts (April 8), Balance of Payments (April 15), Money and Finance (April 22) and Production and Employment (29 April).

The real exchange rate is an index throughout, other quarterly and monthly figures show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the previous year and are positive unless otherwise stated.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UNITED STATES  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

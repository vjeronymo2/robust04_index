			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / The Lex Column: Builders/property Hard as the blow finally fell, the stock market was at least partly braced for a sudden interest rate rise. Those investors who were betting that the move hastened a sterling devaluation - and who were tentatively buying building stocks yesterday on the back of it - might ponder the dazed state of most homeowners and prospective housebuyers as they digested the news last night. Confidence in the housing market was already fragile. Unless interest policy is wholly reversed, housing transactions in the next six months could completely dry up. If the blow to confidence has made the short-term outlook even bleaker than before, there can be no guarantee that a different exchange rate policy would offer sure relief in the medium term. There remains a structural problem in the property market. On the demand side, individuals and companies are weighed down by debts accumulated in the heady days of asset inflation in the late 1980s. On the supply side, house repossessions may be flattening out, but the number of building society customers in arrears of more than six and 12 months has been rising ominously. Much the same sort of shadow overhangs the commercial property market, where hopes are no doubt pinned on a resurgence of inflation. Property was much in vogue as a hedge in the second half of the 1970s, but it is worth remembering that in those days UK investors were shackled by exchange controls and there was nowhere else to go.</p>

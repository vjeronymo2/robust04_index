			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Fears ease of slide in dollar: Central banks hold back from renewed intervention The dollar showed a slight improvement in US trading yesterday, after dropping below the key level of Y100 in Tokyo and London. The firming trend, which came without a repeat of Friday's concerted central bank intervention, triggered a late rally on Wall Street. In Tokyo, where the dollar fell to a new postwar low of Y99.50, analysts estimate the Bank of Japan bought between Dollars 750m (Pounds 493m) and Dollars 1bn supporting the US currency. One factor behind the dollar's weakness was the collapse of Japan's Hata administration, which raised fears that a deal in the long-running US-Japan trade talks was now less likely. In European trading, there was an atmosphere of 'phoney war' as markets waited for central bank intervention that never came. Analysts said the central banks had been chastened by the failure of their efforts last week. However, fears of a dollar collapse proved unfounded and the US currency managed to rally above Y100 during the European morning session. By the London close, the dollar was back down to Y99.865, but later improved in New York. Late in the session, it was trading at Y100.43. Against the D-Mark it was quoted at DM1.5835, more than a pfennig below the level at which Friday's intervention commenced. In Tokyo it opened today at Y100.4. The dollar's weakness yesterday in Tokyo caused most European stock and bond markets to open lower, but they rallied later as the US currency held fairly steady. Analysts said the markets were pausing for breath after taking a battering on Friday. The FT-SE 100 Index opened 31.9 points lower at 2,844.7 but steadily rallied to close at 2,899.9, up 23.3. Gilts were particularly strong, with the September long gilt future rising 1 1/2 points on rumours of a US hedge fund buyer and on hopes that the Treasury would today lower its forecast for the 1994-95 public sector borrowing requirement. German bonds rallied in afternoon trading to close with gains of around 0.4 of a point, and in Frankfurt the Dax index, having closed 16.71 points lower at 1,988.60, rebounded in after-hours trading to 2,000.48. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 48.56 points higher at 3,685.50, as fears eased over an early move by the Federal Reserve to support the dollar with higher US interest rates. The yield on the key 30-year long bond retreated below the 7.50 per cent mark as prices climbed 3/4 of a point. Earlier Asian equity markets were knocked back by the dollar's weakness. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average fell 2.2 per cent or 465.79 to 20,300.96, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index dropped 233.52 points to 8,647.48. In Australia, the Sydney stock market suffered its biggest one-day fall for nearly three years.

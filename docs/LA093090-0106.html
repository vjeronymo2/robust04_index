			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> EFFORT TO BAN LIBRARY BOOKS IS INCREASING;  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP: THE COUNTY SYSTEM HAS REJECTED SEVEN OF 10 REQUESTS TO REMOVE  SPECIFIC VOLUMES THIS YEAR. THE REMAINDER ARE AWAITING DECISIONS.  </P> <P> Ventura County libraries are facing a rising number of requests to ban books,  including efforts to purge an Elvis Presley biography and a Christmas book  featuring a drawing of Santa Claus on a toilet.  </P> <P> Within the last year, the county system's 15 branches have fielded 10 requests  to remove books from its 675,000-volume collection, up from a single request  the previous year and six requests from 1984 to 1988.  </P> <P> The book-banning efforts, while directed mostly at children's books in  community libraries, have reached into the schools. Simi Valley educators this  week will consider pulling a library book because a parent took offense at its  "pictures of scary wolves and people with masks," a district official said.  </P> <P> Allan Jacobs, an associate superintendent for the Simi Valley Unified School  District, declined to reveal the title of the book under reconsideration,  saying the matter is being aptly handled by a special committee.  </P> <P> Amanda Walker wants the county library system to pull "Remember The Alamo," a  1958 children's history book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Robert Penn  Warren. Walker, 36, of Ventura, said the book contains slurs against Latinos  and American Indians that children should not read, even if the passages  reflect the ignorance of earlier times.  </P> <P> "I'm not a book burner. On the whole, I say if you don't like it, don't read  it," Walker said. "But it ticked me off when I found my son reading a book that  said Indians were lazy and stupid."  </P> <P> The efforts to remove books from circulation have alarmed county library  officials, who have received an unprecedented number of "requests for  reconsideration of library materials."  </P> <P> Review committees have rejected seven of the 10 requests this year, with  Walker's appeal and two others awaiting decisions. The volumes retained on the  shelves include a book on werewolves, an illustrated children's book on slugs  and a novel for teen-agers based on the life of a female Indian chief who took  several wives.  </P> <P> "Most of the complaints are coming from older Baby Boom parents who are much  more involved in their children's upbringing," said Sunny Church, manager of  the county library's children services division. "The problem is that they're  trying to force their values on others."  </P> <P> Dixie Adeniran, director of the Ventura County Library Services Agency, would  not release names of those who have sought to take books out of circulation,  contending that they have a right to confidentiality that supersedes open  government laws.  </P> <P> Suzi Skutley, manager of Mr. Nichols bookstore in Santa Paula, said parents  should screen what their children read and not overreact by denying others  access to books they find objectionable, often without reading the entire text.  </P> <P> "A lot of times we shortchange our children and don't give them credit for the  intelligence we've given them," said Skutley, whose store held readings  Saturday of passages from once-banned books to close Banned Book Week. "These  complaints are almost funny, until you realize there is serious intent in what  these people are doing."  </P> <P> The increasing attempts to sanitize Ventura County's public book collection  come at a time when national watchdog groups are reporting a sharp rise in  censorship, including attacks on the works of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe  and the explicit songs of the rap group 2 Live Crew.  </P> <P> People for the American Way, based in Washington, documented 244 attacks  nationwide on educational materials and library books during the 1989-90 school  year, with California accounting for nearly a third of the incidents. Three  fundamentalist Christian groups spearheaded most of the challenges, the group  said in an annual report released last month.  </P> <P> Judith Krug, director of the American Library Assn.'s Office for Intellectual  Freedom, said only 15% of all censorship incidents ever come to public  attention, the remainder being settled quietly by librarians and school  administrators.  </P> <P> "So much censorship in the United States goes undocumented, because someone  objects to some aspect of a book and it silently disappears from a shelf," said  Ed Elrod, co-owner of Ventura Bookstore and an anti-censorship activist.  </P> <P> Oceanview School District Supt. Robert Allen said last week that he removed  "Catcher in the Rye" from the Oceanview Junior High School library in Oxnard.  Allen said he agreed with a protesting parent that the novel was too mature for  junior high students.  </P> <P> "It was taken off the free reading shelf," Allen said. "It's not in the library  now."  </P> <P> Allen said the removal of the J.D. Salinger novel, one of the most often  challenged books since its 1951 publication, didn't amount to book banning, but  rather reflected a judgment on its appropriateness for sixth- through  eighth-graders.  </P> <P> "I can't support forcing material on kids that parents don't approve of," Allen  said. "The child will be caught between two fires."  </P> <P> Many teachers have become cautious in selecting classroom reading lists,  sensing that certain titles will be vetoed by administrators, Elrod said.  </P> <P> Popular young-adult novels such as "Less Than Zero" and "Bright Lights, Big  City," in which the protagonists develop severe cocaine habits before paying  for their vices, would be rejected by many administrators despite their moral  endings, he said.  </P> <P> "So instead, kids are still reading 'Silas Marner' after how many years?" Elrod  said. "A book may be 50 years out-of-date, they won't even read the Cliff  Notes, when they could be reading something contemporary that will challenge  them."  </P> <P> Books questioned across the country in the last year have included perennial  targets such as the works of James Baldwin, Judy Blume, Allen Ginsberg, John  Knowles, Shel Silverstein, Mark Twain, Kurt Vonnegut Jr. and Alice Walker.  </P> <P> Many recent targets simply lacked happy endings. Junior high novels were banned  or challenged in Washington and Oregon for being "devoid of hope and positive  role models," for "the presentation of divorce as a fact of life and derogatory  remarks about friends" and because "the character gets away with bad behavior."  </P> <P> In Goose Lake, Iowa, a book called "Revolting Rhymes" faced expulsion from the  high school library because parents complained that "the boy who is turned into  a mouse will have to stay a mouse the rest of his life." The library director  for the Santa Paula Elementary School District moved the same book from an  elementary to a junior high library a few years ago after a parent complained.  </P> <P> "I just handled it quietly, and frankly, a lot of librarians do that," Patricia  Alderson said, adding that the book was originally purchased for fifth-graders.  "Sometimes I just put the book aside and put it back after a while."  </P> <P> Ventura author Ray Maloney said he was startled when he recently learned that  his novel for young adults, "The Impact Zone," was challenged by a library  patron in Multnomah County, Ore. The book, which includes profanity and sexual  references, is about a 15-year-old surfer who leaves Ventura to search for his  father in Hawaii.  </P> <P> "There seems to be a belief these days that people should be in lock-step,  marching in the same direction at the same speed," said Maloney, who works as a  technical writer for an area defense contractor. "That's what gets a society in  trouble."  </P> <P> A 37-year-old woman, who declined to reveal her name, said she asked the  Camarillo Library last week to pull "Please Don't Kiss Me Now" by Merrill J.  Gerber from juvenile book racks. She said a librarian recommended the book,  which contains four-letter words and sexual references, for her 13-year-old  daughter.  </P> <P> "When you read things, they're retained in your brain. If they stick it in the  adult section, no one will bother to check it out," she said.  </P> <P> Unlike the county system, the Oxnard Public Library has not received a formal  request to pull a book since 1984, Director Gail Warren said.  </P> <P> Librarians said informal complaints about a book's content outnumber requests  to pull books from circulation by at least 10 to 1.  </P> <P> Brad S. Miller, a reference librarian at the Thousand Oaks Library, said he and  his colleagues take great pains to explain to people why a book should be  retained even if they find it distasteful. He said the only recent censorship  attempt at the city-run library centered on the film "The Last Temptation of  Christ" and a patron's assertion that it should be pulled from the library's  video section.  </P> <P> "There is a lot of earnestness in what the people feel," Miller said. "There  has to be long and careful explanations as to why the material is here."  </P> <P> Simply voicing their dissatisfaction is a catharsis for most people, Warren  said. "A lot of people just need to get it off their chest. They usually go  away realizing there are others in the world with different tastes."  </P> <P> "It's a library responsibility to have a variety of points of view available on  controversial matters so people can come in and make up their own minds on a  subject," Adeniran of the Ventura County Library Services Agency said. "The  taste and interest of one particular party ought not to deprive other people of  their right to read something of interest to them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> CHALLENGED BOOKS  </P> <P> Listed below are six of the 10 books challenged in the county library system  within the last year.  </P> <P> "Elvis" by Albert Goldman, a biography that includes details of Presley's drug  and sex life. The protester sought its removal from the adult section because  "so many young adults look up to Elvis, his use of drugs and sexual perversion  may make young people emulate this behavior." Request denied.  </P> <P> "Slugs" by David Greenberg and Victoria Chess. The picture book of human-sized  slugs suggests gnarly things for children to do with them, including "tie them  to a bottle rocket," and "use them in banana splits." The slugs stuff their  tormentor in a garbage can. The protester asked, "Can you imagine what a  5-year-old boy could fry, blend, microwave, and dissect?" and said the theme of  the book was "Slugs are not good for anything." Request denied.  </P> <P> "Father Christmas" by Raymond Briggs. A picture book in which Santa is  ill-tempered about having to make his annual rounds. A children's literary  magazine praised the book for depicting a Santa who "is still hard-working and  faithful," but who "can also be grumpy and impatient -- in short, thoroughly  human." The protester objected to a drawing of Santa on a toilet and "the  negative overview of Santa's view about Christmas." Request denied.  </P> <P> "Meet The Werewolf," by Georgess McHargue. A book detailing the werewolf legend  that includes a recipe and incantations on how to become one. A literary  magazine noted that the book "comes right out and says that 'human beings  cannot really change themselves into wolves.' " The objector wanted the book  banned after discovering his son and a friend trying out the concoction and  spell. Request denied.  </P> <P> "Woman Chief" by Rose Sobel. A historical novel for teen-agers based on the  life of a Crow woman who rose to lead her tribe and took several wives, as was  the custom for Crow chieftains. A reviewer for "School Library Journal" found  "the personal relationships of this unorthodox woman . . . are only hinted at."  The protester said the book illustrated that "a woman has an opportunity to  rise to the pinnacle of her society" but objected to "an implicit theme that  lesbianism is all right." Request denied.  </P> <P> "Games End" by Milton Dank. A children's novel whose main characters are  involved in the French Resistance during World War II. The protester objected  to profanity and "insinuations to adultery-prostitution situations" on one page  that might lead children to think "that this type of behavior is modeled by  responsible adults." Committee decision is pending.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AFTER FALSE START, RELIGIOUS COALITION RENEWS MINISTRY TO AIDS PATIENTS  </P> <P> A year ago this month, a procession of robed clergy from a dozen Valley  congregations, 200 worshipers and a gospel choir gathered in a joyous  celebration of faith at Temple Beth Hillel in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The gathering was more than a gesture of interfaith goodwill. The worshipers  were people with AIDS, their families and friends. The congregation also  included members of churches and temples who wanted to show their support.  </P> <P> The colorful service trumpeted the formation of the Valley Interfaith AIDS  Coalition, which planned to hold monthly AIDS worship services and act as a  local clearinghouse for information and assistance on acquired immune  deficiency syndrome.  </P> <P> But the group had trouble sustaining that first outpouring of support.  Subsequent services were shorter, smaller gatherings. Then, faced with funding  and staff limitations, the coalition discontinued the services for the summer.  In the fall, the services did not resume.  </P> <P> Today, the coalition's leaders say they have regained lost momentum, citing a  pressing need to provide spiritual help and social services to Valley residents  affected by AIDS.  </P> <P> In January they revived the AIDS services, scheduling them for the third Sunday  of each month at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in North Hollywood. The group  prepared to poll Valley churches and synagogues about pooling resources to help  people with AIDS and their loved ones. It also began planning an AIDS  information forum in March.  </P> <P> "They've been re-energized," said Barry Smedberg, executive director of the San  Fernando Valley Interfaith Council. The AIDS coalition operates under the  auspices of the council, which represents about 250 Valley congregations.  </P> <P> Still, Smedberg said the coalition faces serious obstacles. AIDS activists must  compete against other groups that want religious leaders' attention on a  variety of social issues, ranging from homelessness to malathion spraying. For  many clergy members, AIDS is an issue they would rather ignore.  </P> <P> "Some have not been able to differentiate the AIDS problem from homosexuality,  which some churches have a difficult time embracing," Smedberg said.  </P> <P> Two years ago, Lutheran Social Services invited clergy members from 48 San  Fernando Valley Lutheran churches to attend a seminar on helping congregants  cope with AIDS. Just one minister showed up, recalled Smedberg, who was then  the agency's area director.  </P> <P> Although attendance might be higher today, he said, "there's a lot of apathy  out there on this issue."  </P> <P> The reluctance of Valley clergy to become involved with AIDS issues mirrors a  nationwide trend, said Keith Wintermute, a Presbyterian minister in Oxnard who  produced a documentary film last year called "AIDS and the Church's Role."  </P> <P> "This is a disease that pushes people to the brink of eternity," he said. "They  face the fundamental issues of faith, and their families desperately need the  voice of the pastor or rabbi or priest. The churches are kind of sitting back  and yawning. It's staggering."  </P> <P> The revived Valley Interfaith AIDS Coalition hopes to fill this void by  providing spiritual and social programs that are more readily available  elsewhere in the city.  </P> <P> "Just because we're on the other side of the hill doesn't mean we don't have  the same problems as the rest of Los Angeles," said Marsha Van Valkenburg, a  Northridge resident who chairs the coalition.  </P> <P> As of Dec. 31, 8,576 cases of AIDS had been reported in the county since 1981,  with 5,686 resulting in death, according to the Los Angeles County Department  of Health Services. For the same period, 386 of the reported AIDS cases, or  about 5%, were in the Valley.  </P> <P> Although some religious leaders in other parts of Los Angeles have taken a more  active role, getting clergy to address AIDS has been difficult. "It's not as  'safe' as giving food and clothing to the homeless," said the Rev. Ginny  Wagener, a coalition member who is pastor at St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in  North Hollywood.  </P> <P> When AIDS patients or family members seek spiritual comfort, local hospitals  often turn first to the predominantly gay Metropolitan Community Church in the  Valley.  </P> <P> "Our pastor was constantly being called because he was the only one thought to  be sympathetic," said Sean Kinney, a coalition member and a founder of  Metropolitan's AIDS ministry. Kinney hopes the coalition can spread some of the  work around.  </P> <P> The group's new questionnaire will try to find clergy from other Valley  congregations who are willing to assist hospitals in AIDS cases. "The coalition  had a specific interest to me because our church was almost tapped out," Kinney  said.  </P> <P> The group also wants to help people with AIDS connect with local social  services, such as a new Meals on Wheels program that will deliver low-cost food  to homebound people who are younger than 60. Traditionally, such meals have  been provided only to senior citizens.  </P> <P> Alma Patotzka, volunteer director of the meal program, which is sponsored by  the interfaith council, said her problem is getting the word out to Valley  residents with AIDS or other serious illnesses. "I have the program, I have the  volunteers, but I don't have the clients," she said.  </P> <P> The AIDS coalition dates back to a directive given two years ago to Father Ed  Allen, rector at St. Andrew and St. Charles Episcopal Church in Granada Hills.  </P> <P> "I had been approached by one of our bishops and asked to set up a center for  AIDS information for the Episcopal churches in the Valley," he recalled. "We  spent a year avoiding the issue as much as anything. As we learned more about  it, we realized it was too big an issue for one denomination to handle."  </P> <P> A committee at Allen's church sent letters to about 300 religious leaders in  the Valley, asking them to attend a meeting about AIDS assistance. Six  prominent clergy members from various faiths signed the letter.  </P> <P> About two dozen people representing 18 congregations attended the first  meeting, said Van Valkenburg. "We decided the first priority was to let the  Valley know we were here," she said. "The best way to do that was by having a  service."  </P> <P> "It was very powerful," recalled Rabbi Steven Jacobs of the New Reform  Congregation of Woodland Hills. "It was just a very moving experience. We used  dancing, singing and prayer. It was a joyous experience."  </P> <P> Along with the monthly AIDS worship services, the coalition has tried to  educate religious leaders about the disease.  </P> <P> "Clergy people are first and foremost human beings, with the same fears and  trepidations that everyone else has regarding sexuality and mortality," said  Van Valkenburg. "We felt that if we could educate the clergy, we would be  encouraged to come into their congregations to educate the people."  </P> <P> The task is difficult because some religious leaders associate AIDS with sinful  behavior.  </P> <P> "Some people like to think of it as a punishment for being a gay person," said  Jacobs. "Nothing could be further from the truth. When a person is suffering or  dying, you don't sit in judgment. You extend compassion."  </P> <P> Joe McGowan, associate pastor at St. Stephen Presbyterian Church in Chatsworth,  said the problem is not unique to the Valley. Before assuming his post in  September, McGowan served on a New Orleans AIDS task force that also had  trouble attracting volunteers from the clergy.  </P> <P> "The church has done very little in this area," he said. "I'm talking about all  faiths."  </P> <P> McGowan said AIDS worship services are important because people affected by the  disease face religious turning points. "There are some who go through great  spiritual tension at this time and some go through spiritual experiences in  re-establishing their faith in God," he said.  </P> <P> He said the local AIDS worship services are "also tailored to the care-givers,  the nurses and doctors, the people who deal with this on a regular basis. The  services are very positive. They stress God's love and grace and God's healing  power. They're not designed to tell these people they've done wrong and if they  turn their lives around, they'll get well."  </P> <P> Leaders of the Valley Interfaith AIDS Coalition became involved for a variety  of reasons.  </P> <P> Van Valkenburg joined the group partly because she observed the harassment of  gay co-workers. "I've always been very outspoken against prejudice of any  kind," she said.  </P> <P> Wagener had worked on AIDS projects in San Francisco and Omaha. "One thing I've  found is people who have AIDS are life-affirming, rather than being preoccupied  with death and dying," she said. "That's been the biggest surprise to me, the  biggest blessing I've received from the people who have AIDS.  </P> <P> "It's not so much that we professionals in faith are bestowing spirituality on  people with AIDS. Often it's the other way around."  </P> <P> Four years ago, Kinney helped found an AIDS ministry at his North Hollywood  church. "Even though we were a gay and lesbian organization, we didn't have a  response," he said. "There was mass denial within our own people about what was  going on."  </P> <P> More recently, Kinney himself has tested positive for exposure to the AIDS  virus. "It challenges every spiritual foundation," he said.  </P> <P> A recent addition to the coalition is a North Hollywood resident who has  attended a mainstream church in Northridge for many years. The coalition  member, who asked that his name not be used, said his family and co-workers  know he is gay, but not his fellow worshipers.  </P> <P> "The church is the only place I'm not 'out,' " he said. "My discomfort is my  own, not anything they're inflicting."  </P> <P> He said he joined the interfaith coalition because "it's important for me to  support other people who are affected. Here at the Valley Interfaith AIDS  Coalition, I found an ongoing, affirming ministry."  </P></p>

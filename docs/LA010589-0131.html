			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SMOKING ORDINANCE REQUIREMENTS EASED  </P> <P> Heeding protests from restaurateurs, the Beverly Hills City Council has dropped  a requirement for expensive smoke ventilation systems in large restaurants and  introduced a scaled-down smoking ordinance that requires restaurants to set  aside at least 60% of their seating for nonsmokers.  </P> <P> Under the revised ordinance, which must go to the council on second reading,  only large restaurants that open after Jan. 1 must install the ventilation  systems. Also, new restaurants can avoid the requirement if they install walls  separating smoking and nonsmoking areas.  </P> <P> The ordinance does not affect bars, lounges, private banquet rooms or  restaurants in hotels.  </P> <P> The new measure is a victory for restaurant owners, who complained that the  ventilation systems would be expensive and cumbersome. The old law requiring  the systems was passed in July, 1987, after restaurant owners protested a  highly publicized ban on all smoking in larger restaurants.  </P></p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Interview: Trial separation from a claustrophobic God - After seven years as a nun, Karen Armstrong turned her back on the Catholic heirarchy. Now she has rediscovered her faith in a different kind of deity THIRTY YEARS ago, Karen Armstrong got married. She borrowed some white winklepickers and cut her hair with rusty scissors. She vowed to give everything to her groom and she struggled with the relationship for seven years, striving to obey, humiliating herself, even whipping her own flesh in an attempt to become more obedient. The marriage ended in divorce as Armstrong, by then ill with undiagnosed epilepsy, began to doubt if her groom existed at all. Now well again, and writing books in a pleasant little house in the north London suburb of East Finchley, she has just finished the biography of her ex-husband, whom she thought she had lost forever. Yet, in researching The History of God, she has found 'Him' again. Armstrong joined her strict Roman Catholic order as a novice nun of just 17. As the 1960s swung outside, she was on her hands and knees wearing scratchy underpants, engaged in a search for the supreme being. She says: 'At adolescence, when you are so bogged down in misery about your own confusions, the idea of losing yourself in God and finding an enhanced self seemed enormously attractive.' Instead of losing herself, she found she was confronted endlessly by her own inadequacies. 'The convent made us so concerned about ourselves, there was no way we could have a religious experience.' If the search for God in the convent was painful, life outside was even worse. 'It was hard, because people assumed it would be great to be out. But I was just sick with grief, and very ill for about six years. I was grieving the loss of God, of me, of a whole life.' In leaving the convent to study English at Oxford, she traded one claustrophobic institution for another. 'I found Oxford was a highly unkind society, where distinguished academics sat around bitching about each other.' In spite of her dismissiveness, the university has left its mark: her intense manner, antique furniture, books, black leggings and the Cuban-heel boots tell more of the stylish intellectual than the ex-nun. After a few years outside, she gave up Catholicism and started to think of herself as an atheist. 'It was a great relief to be rid of the big brother noting your every failure. A god who is organising Bosnia, the Sudan, Somalia - frankly, I don't want to know anything about him or her.' Faced with cruelty around her both on a big and a small scale, she became obsessed with the need for kindness. 'Over the years, compassion became more and more central to me,' she says, managing to sound neither goody-goody nor pompous. Yet, after steeping herself in 4,000 years of man's thoughts on God, she found she remains a believer. She rejects much of Christianity and is opposed vehemently to anything that smacks of doctrine or idolatry. Nowadays, she describes her self as a 'freelance monotheist.' The research for her book showed her that the quest for a supreme being was flawed at the outset. To her surprise, she says she found that all the wisest thinkers in Christianity, Judaism and Islam had reached the same conclusion independently: that God is not - contrary to popular belief - an objective reality at all. 'God is an experience of something larger. It is not just within - it is something beyond. The religions are an endless dance between an immanence and a transcendence, something that pulls us beyond our little prejudices and which offer a challenge.' This transcendence struck her first when she was reading TS Eliot and John Donne as a teenager. 'Poetry and music did it for me. A sense of something beautiful, just out of reach.' That sense now comes to her through study, and she likens herself to the black-coated Jews who stand muttering over their prayer books. It is just as well she likes study, as she has much ahead: in conversation, almost every fresh subject suggests a theme for a future book. Once she has finished writing about the ordination of women, she plans to tackle the rise of fundamentalism world-wide, the role of women in religion, and a history of religious fanatics in the US. She says the point of religion is to hold us in a state of wonder. It should help us to ask questions: the problems arise when it starts to answer them. 'A lot of religion crowds out that wonder by giving doctrinal answers that explain everything. Who is God?' Impatiently, she rattles off catechisms learnt as a child as if they were, self-evidently, nonsense. 'One of the mistakes of western Christianity is to put so much emphasis on extraordinary doctrines about God somehow being three in one, and on lengthy creeds about the resurrection and life everlasting.' Most people - she says 99 per cent of Americans and two-thirds of Britons claim to believe in God - remain stuck with a notion of Him learnt in childhood. 'Our ideas of other disciplines become more sophisticated as we grow up, but most people's ideas of God - including those of atheists - have remained at that infantile level.' Having shunned the 'multifarious and bizarre things' that Christianity expects people to believe, Armstrong has picked her own beliefs from different religions at different times. A bit of Greek Orthodoxy here, some Buddhism there, and a sprinkling of mysticism over everything. She also admires Islam. 'In the Moslem creed, there is no divinity but God and Mohammed is the prophet. That's it,' she says, approvingly. 'A cross-fertilisation of ideas is now just what is needed to give tired old monotheism a shot in the arm. Now, in the 20th century, you do not have to be a Jew or Christian just because you were born in Europe. We have discovered through better communications that all these religions have been doing the same thing. They will talk about God, or they will not, but the experience and the ideals are pretty much the same.' Yet, Armstrong is not optimistic: the rise of fundamentalism in all three religions shows people digging themselves deeper into their narrow trenches. She does not notice the western church looking outside for fresh ideas. 'The churches, as a whole, have a great deal of re-thinking to do. Look at all of them quarrelling about the ordination of women - where is their compassion for a suffering world?' Throughout the discussion, it is to the issue of compassion that she returns constantly. This, she says, is the acid test of all religions; without it, a religion has failed. 'All the great religions of the world have found that the ability to integrate your religious experience with normal mundane life, and become more compassionate, is what matters.' Had she known all this three decades ago, might she have stayed in the convent? Armstrong shakes her head, emphatically. She believes some people are natural nuns - but not her. It was not that convent life was unendurably hard, nor that she was expected to behave as a submissive Victorian woman. (She joined just before the Second Vatican Council swept away some of the repressive practices that she refers to, politely, as 'clutter'). One problem was celibacy. 'It's the loneliness. That is the side of celibacy that is hard. Even though you are in the middle of a community, you are deeply alone.' Another was having to live with a group of people she had not chosen. 'In the convent, there were some nuns who did not love people but who loved the cat. They had started grabbing back little satisfactions to take the place of big things. I knew that would happen to me.' Apparently, many other inmates reached the same conclusion: there was an exodus from the convents in the 1960s and 1970s, and many of the orders - like hers - set up to do good works have had to re-define their role. 'A lot of the so-called good works are now performed by the state. The orders that are getting the same number of vocations are the contemplative orders. They are doing very well.' She thinks those kind of orders will always do well. In delving into the past 4,000 years, she has found religious communities seeding themselves in all ages and all societies. 'There always have been, and always will be, people that have the need and the talent for contemplation, just as there are people who are going to want to write poetry or become musicians.' If not a contemplative, then, was she just an escapee from the real world? She looks impatient. 'There is too much unhealthy concentration on motives. We are all drop-outs. Marriage can be a great selfish act of dropping out. Some people put up the net curtains and shut the world out.' Although she has never been married, she makes the observation without bitterness. 'I still live alone because I am that kind of person. I suppose I am still looking for something. I went into a convent looking for something and here I am, at the grand old age of nearly 50, still writing books about God.' Surely, though, she is nearer her destination now? Not at all. Perhaps it is more a case of having found her means of transport. 'Buddha said that questions about the ultimate reality were improper. The most he could say was that there is a shore on the other side of the river and give you a raft to take you over. That is what religion should be.'</p>

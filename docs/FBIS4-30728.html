			<p>BFN     [Text] In the old building at the Bayon Telecommunications  Centre, there are still a couple of signs up in Khmer and  Russian but probably not for long.    The original Soviet Intersputnik dish now carries nothing  except for occasional TV transmissions and Telstra OTC's  expatriate technicians have nearly completed their job of  setting up a brand new International Telecommunications Centre  for Phnom Penh.    The Standard 'A' satellite earth station is already  completed  and the necessary transmission equipment should be ready in time  for commissioning in September this year.    The relationship between the Ministry of Posts and  Telecommunications (MPTC) and Telstra goes back to 1990, when  the Australian company first approached the Cambodians with a  proposal to develop the telecommunications sector.    Since then, Telstra has invested over U.S. $16 million of  its  own money in the Cambodian project. Russell Stuart, Telstra's  senior representative in the country explained that  telecommunications is "a revenue-generating industry...which can  develop by itself".    The present financial arrangement is that MPTC will receive  100 per cent of the revenue from outgoing calls as well as 51  per cent of the revenue from incoming calls. Telstra gets the  leftover 49 per cent.    The Australians are evidently making a long-term investment.    This was confirmed by Minister of Posts and  Telecommunications, So Khun, on a visit to the new centre  recently. He anticipated his ministry's relationship with  Telstra continuing into the next century and said he "very much  appreciated" Telstra's co-operation.    At present, subscriber calls first go to the General Post  Office Exchange and then via fibre optic cable to the Bayon  centre which currently has direct links to only four countries  -- Japan, Australia, Singapore and Thailand.    From September, Phnom Penh subscribers will be linked  straight to the new centre's earth station which will provide  access to more than 200 countries worldwide.    Telstra brought in its own workers to install the  telecommunications equipment but is training 150 Cambodian MPTC  staff to take over the operation of the centre.</p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity market surges to all-time high HEAVY overseas buying of June Footsie futures, principally by US investment banks, and a rethink by domestic institutions of the equity market's prospects after Tuesday's interest rate cut, saw the FT-SE 100-share Index burst through its all-time peak and launch a determined but ultimately unsuccessful attack on the 2,700 level. At the close of another session of heavy trading the index stood at a record 2,698.7, up 36.5 on the day. The market's previous all-time peak, an intraday level of 2,683.7, was attained last September, coinciding with a reduction in bank base rates to 10.5 per cent. Since the Tories' general election victory the Footsie has risen 262.3 points, or almost 11 per cent. Many dealers were caught on the hop by a sudden transformation in the market's fortunes which took place mid-morning. Share prices had opened with widespread but moderate losses as marketmakers, mindful of Wall Street's overnight decline and a general view of a period of consolidation, were happy to cut dealing levels in the hope that the lower prices would attract much needed stock into the market. Opening some five points down, the Footsie proceeded to drift back and registered a decline just exceeding nine points within an hour of the opening, reflecting bouts of profit-taking, before embarking on a remarkable rally which eventually propelled the index into virgin territory. A couple of indifferent trading results, from Tate &amp; Lyle and Trafalgar House, added to the early uncertainty. The emergence of the big US-sourced buying orders in the Footsie future  - one leading US house was said to have purchased 2,000 contracts and another was heavily involved on the buy side - triggered a scramble to cover short positions by other brokers, and the future promptly surged ahead. The cash market, where buying interest revealed widespread short positions in many stocks, went with futures and, by midday, was threatening to puncture the all-time high. Shortly afterwards the index sailed through the previous high and kept on going, helped by a firm opening on Wall Street, until it met a flurry of resistance just short of 2,700. The US buying was not confined to futures, but encompassed traditional North American investment favourites such as Hanson, Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. BAT, after good first-quarter results, was also well supported. On the downside, Trafalgar House's halved interim dividend, in spite of the increased profits, induced exceptionally heavy selling, while Tate &amp; Lyle's half-year results and the post-figures meeting with sector analysts saw the shares under pressure throughout the day. British Gas was another notable underperformer, with the shares persistently sold after Ofgas's demand for a cut in prices to customers. Mr Steve Turner, energy specialist at Smith New Court, said Gas's warning on prices was: 'An indication of a summer of discontent as far as relations between British Gas and the industry regulator are concerned.' Seaq turnover in equities totalled 637.1m shares.</p>

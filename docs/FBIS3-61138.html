			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Viktor Starik, personal correspondent (Belt): </F> "Economic Rebirth Party"]    [Text] Members of the Moldovan Economic Rebirth Party  (PEVM) attended a constituent assembly last Saturday in the Belt  Municipal Palace of Culture.    The platform they approved says that this is a new political  party, uniting all social strata of the republic population on  the side of cardinal changes in the state-administrative economy  and the establishment of a law-governed state.    Members of the initiating group, President Aleksandr  Kisherin  of Kisherin &amp; Co., an agroindustrial firm, Moldovan People's  Deputy Anatoliy Konoplin, Moldovan Savings Bank branch manager  Vladimir Chekin, KPP Director Aleksandr Sukhostavskiy, and other  prominent administrators of enterprises in Belt, had this to say  about the need for this new party in a political statement they  issued during the preparations for the constituent assembly:    "Just yesterday we still expected the republic parliament  and  government to lead the economy out of crisis. We believed that  the political confrontation would come to an end.... We  anticipated the start of genuine, effective economic reform in  Moldova.    "Today we can see that these hopes and other expectations  were unjustified. The social and economic conditions of our life  are particularly disturbing and are growing worse each day....    "The reason, in our opinion, is that the politicians in  power  care more about their group interests and ambitions than about  the actual standard of living.    "The PEVM intends to fight for the interests of the laboring  public, for social justice in our society, and for the  territorial integrity of Moldova. The new party advocates the  restoration of ruined technical and intellectual potential and  favors stronger ties with the republics of the former USSR, the  developed capitalist countries, and the dissolved socialist  camp."    The new political party which was founded in Belt has  already  been joined by more than 600 people and supports the development  of collective and private businesses, entrepreneurship, and a  flexible tax policy.    As speakers remarked at the constituent assembly, the PEVM  cannot participate autonomously in the current parliamentary  elections, but this does not mean that it will stay out of  politics. Its members include many respected industrialists and  entrepreneurs whose opinions are certain to influence the  government and president of Moldova.    Many of Moldova's northern regions support the PEVM platform  and the charter adopted at the constituent assembly and sent  representatives to the gathering.</p>

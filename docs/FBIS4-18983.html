			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["LNS" report on interview with Belgian Foreign Minister </F> Claes in Brussels; date not given: "Minister Claes Does Not  Expect UN Mandate in Rwanda To Be Extended"]    [Text] Brussels -- Foreign Minister Willy Claes does not  expect the Security Council to extend the mandate of UN troops  in Rwanda. "A debate in New York is inevitable," he said  yesterday on television. He recalled that the UN troops were  sent to Rwanda to help realize the implementation of the Arusha  peace agreement. The murder of President Habyarimana has made  the further existence of the agreement doubtful.    Claes expected the United Nations to be very reluctant to  grant another extension of the mandate. He emphasized that the  Belgian soldiers in Rwanda would not intervene.    "The UN soldiers are remaining within their mandate as  peacekeepers, the paratroopers who went there have a clear  humanitarian mission," the minister said on "The Seventh Day"  television news program yesterday.    Claes left no doubt about the need to send Belgian troops to  Rwanda. "At the time both the president and the rebels asked us  to send troops. The United Nations also urged us to send  soldiers, because our UN troops have a good reputation," the  minister said, admitting that the mandate and the arming of the  UN troops could have been better. The minister thought it was  correct that the Belgian UN troops had not intervened in recent  days.    They do not have antitank artillery and interference in the  internal disputes would unavoidably lead to revenge attacks on  whites.    "The hostility of part of the presidential guard against the  Belgians was due to the impartiality of Belgium, which supported  the peace agreement and never chose sides," Claes said.    "We have always told both sides that they must respect human  rights," he said. "I would also note that the anti-Belgian  attitude comes from extremists only."</p>

			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Eight nations of South America's Amazon basin called on wealthy countries to  provide money for the preservation of the world's greatest rain forest and for  the economic development of the region. At the first summit meeting on the  Amazon, the governments said the funds should be provided without any strings  attached. The presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Peru, Suriname  and Venezuela and the foreign minister of Bolivia met in Manaus, Brazil, and  issued a "Declaration of Amazonia." The document, taking note of the world  outcry over the onslaught on the forests, said the international attention paid  to the Amazon should be converted into "measures of cooperation on the  financial and technical levels".  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Aden, 26 Jun -- Northern troops stationed near Aden  intensified artillery and missile shelling this afternoon  against many areas in the center of the city, thus violating the  cease-fire Sanaa authorities had announced would come into  effect beginning at midnight last night.    A southern military communique said today that the shelling  hit a school in the al-Tawahi area near the port and killed 15  people, among them women and children who took shelter in the  school after fleeing the Shaykh 'Uthman area because of heavy  shelling.    The military communique said that the continued northern  shelling of residential areas and vital installations led to the  killing of hundreds of people and the wounding of dozens of  citizens in their homes. It also caused the continued  disruption of water supplies. [words indistinct]    Shelling is still continuing against Aden from the north and  west, where the northern troops continue their attempts to  advance toward the city.</p>

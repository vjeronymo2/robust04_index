			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq says Israel is facing a  very serious challenge in Gaza and Jericho. According to  Lieutenant General Baraq, the agreement with the PLO confers  three missions on the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]: To defend  the external borders of the region included in the agreement, to  guard the Jewish settlements, and to safeguard the travel axes.    Our correspondent Yo'el Nir reports that Lt. Gen. Baraq told  the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the IDF  understands that the government has decided to let the  Palestinian police deal with the sources of terrorism. Israel  assumes this will be a strong and efficient police which will  cooperate with Israel in foiling terrorism and safeguarding the  roads. The chief of staff made it clear that the IDF will  continue to deal with terrorist acts along travel axes and in  their vicinity. If the terrorists are not caught near the  roads, however, the Palestinian police force will have to deal  with them.    [Tel Aviv IDF Radio in Hebrew at 1400 GMT on 4 January,  reporting on the chief of staff's Knesset appearances, adds:  "Lt. Gen. Baraq told the committee that in 1993, 450 people  were stricken off the wanted list -- 42 of them were killed, the  rest either turned themselves in, were caught, or escaped  abroad. The chief of staff added that 1993 was characterized by  a fight against terrorism in the security zone and the rest of  Lebanon, as well as by the fight against the intifadah in Judaea  and Samaria. At the same time the IDF continued its buildup  program on the basis of the multiyear work plan."]    Answering a question regarding the involvement of senior  officers in the agreement with the PLO, the chief of staff said  that senior officers on the ground and in the General Staff are  not supposed to deal with the political aspects of the  agreement. At the same time the Army must explain in detail all  the military ramifications and present its conclusions to the  government. Deputy Chief of Staff Amnon Shahaq is dealing with  the technical aspects of the agreement and is trying to reach  the best possible arrangements in the security sphere. The  chief of staff rejected charges made by the opposition that  those officers who are opposed to the agreement are being  silenced. He added that there are no problems or uncertainties  regarding orders relating to this issue or compliance therewith.    Our correspondent notes that at the opening of the session  all members of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee  congratulated the IDF since over the last year no soldiers were  killed in training accidents.</p>

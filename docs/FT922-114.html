			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger world wheat crop forecast WORLD WHEAT production for 1992-93 will be the second biggest on record at 548m tonnes, according to the International Wheat Council. This compares with 544m tonnes for 1991-92 and the record 594m tonnes the year before. Usage is predicted to fall by 10m tonnes to 553m tonnes in 1992-93 as less wheat will go for animal feed. As a result there should be a 3m-tonne stocks rise to 134m tonnes. Mr Bill de Maria, the IWC's chief economist, points out that the IWC is now measuring grain output in the former Soviet Union by net weight after cleaning and drying, as opposed to bunker weight in previous analyses. Given the size of wheat production from that geographical area (85m tonnes for 1992-93) the change could mean a difference of between 5m and 6m tonnes in total world output. On the world market, the former Soviet Union had switched from being a cash buyer to a credit buyer. 'If they are to buy they will very much need access to credit for both purchase and freight,' he says. While there are worries about defaults, 'we have to assume credit will be available.' The IWC estimates that total 1992-93 grain imports will be 25m tonnes (14m tonnes wheat and 11m tonnes coarse grains). World total coarse grain production is predicted at 824m tonnes for 1992-93, up 26m tonnes and only 1m tonnes off the 1990-91 record. Consumption is expected to edge ahead to 815m tonnes, leaving stocks at 122m tonnes, compared with 115m tonnes in 1991-92.</p>

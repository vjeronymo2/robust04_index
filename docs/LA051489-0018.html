			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: NEPOTISM, CONT'D  </P> <P> No sooner did we report -- two weeks back -- on the many family ties found  among cast and crew of the movie, "Say Anything" than we were tipped to a  frenzy of familial connections on CBS' new series, "Jesse Hawkes."  </P> <P> Starring Robert Conrad and his sons Christian and Shane, it's exec-produced by  Conrad's daughter, Joan Conrad. Her hubby, Tim Irwin, is transportation  coordinator. His sister, Lindsay Thomas -- who's married to associate producer  Scott Thomas -- is the set decorator.  </P> <P> Stunt coordinator Justin Lundin and driver Rick Lundin are brothers. Animal  handler Robin Keyser is married to set dresser Chris Keyser. Caterer Norton  Flynn is married to Conrad's daughter, Nancy Conrad -- who assists him with the  catering, "and sometimes does bit roles" in Conrad shows, according to a series  source.  </P> <P> Production coordinator Paula Dupree isn't related to anyone -- but she used to  be the Conrad family's baby-sitter.  </P> <P> Wait! In the series' pilot episode, Camille Conrad -- Bob's daughter, 3 --  played a kidnap victim. "Her screen debut," says our source. Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

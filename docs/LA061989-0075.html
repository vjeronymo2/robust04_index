			<p><P> June 19, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISNEY-STEINBERG 'GREENMAIL' TRIAL NEARS OPENING DAY  </P> <P> Once upon a time in 1984, the corporate guardians of Mickey Mouse and his  friends were besieged by a scary raider. After he huffed and puffed at their  house, they gave him $59 million to go away. But some stockholders cried  "Greenmail!" and filed lawsuits.  </P> <P> The tale of Saul J. Steinberg and his $325-million tender offer for 49% of Walt  Disney Co. is now about to be dissected in a Los Angeles civil trial.  Defendants accused of breach of fiduciary duty and other violations of  California law include Steinberg, Disney Co. and 11 people who were directors  at the time.  </P> <P> Other defendants include Steinberg's financial adviser in the deal, Drexel  Burnham Lambert, and Disney's investment banker, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., both  New York firms. Drexel's Beverly Hills "junk bond" office also worked for  Steinberg on the deal.  </P> <P> A class-action suit on behalf of an estimated 60,000 Disney stockholders -- who  lost money selling their shares on a depressed market -- seeks the money that  Steinberg gained from his deal. While held by court order in a special fund the  past five years, the $59 million has grown to about $100 million with interest.  </P> <P> Plaintiffs refer to the Disney buyout of Steinberg as greenmail, a term often  used when a company buys a major block of its stock from a raider -- paying him  a premium price to avoid being taken over.  </P> <P> Among the prominent names that figure in the cast of the Disney-Steinberg  events in June, 1984, are those of junk bond wizard Michael Milken and  movie-and-casino magnate Kirk Kerkorian. Neither are defendants, but their  roles are expected to be discussed in testimony.  </P> <P> Kerkorian was a Steinberg ally who had an option to buy Disney's film  production business for $447.5 million if Steinberg won control of the company  with his tender offer.  </P> <P> Milken, who was involved in Drexel's financing for Steinberg, is facing  unrelated federal criminal charges of racketeering and securities law  violations in a major Wall Street insider trading scandal.  </P> <P> As much as plaintiffs would like to question Milken on the witness stand, the  chances appeared dim. Defense attorneys said in court Friday that they were  informed that when Milken appears Tuesday in New York under subpoena by the  plaintiffs for his deposition, he will exercise his Fifth Amendment right  against self-incrimination by declining to answer all substantive questions in  the Disney-Steinberg case.  </P> <P> If that occurs, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Abby Soven assured  defense lawyers Friday, she will not allow plaintiffs to summon Milken as a  witness in the trial just to exercise his constitutional right to remain  silent.  </P> <P> She also served notice that references to the criminal cases against Milken and  Drexel would not be permitted before the jury.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the limelight of a public trial of the greenmail allegations were  likely to increase the discomfort index for many involved.  </P> <P> Disney directors named defendants include Ronald W. Miller, former president  and chief executive, who was a son-in-law of company founder Walt Disney.  Miller resigned three months after the company bought Steinberg's stock for  $325 million, well above the market value at that time, and the company's stock  price fell sharply after Steinberg withdrew his offer.  </P> <P> The Disney stock has soared in value in the past several years with the film  profits under the management of Michael D. Eisner, chairman and chief  executive, who followed the Miller regime. Since 1986, Disney went from No. 3  to No. 1 movie company in its share of domestic box-office revenue.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Defendants  </P> <P> Steinberg's uncompleted tender offer for Disney stock in 1984 was for $72.50  per share. Lawyers for defendant Disney directors assert that the market value  of a Disney share held in 1984 "now exceeds $370 and continues to climb."  </P> <P> Besides Miller, past and present Disney directors who are defendants in the  civil case are former Chairman Raymond L. Watson, Richard A. Nunis, E. Cardon  Walker, Robert H. B. Baldwin, Caroline Leonetti Ahmanson, Philip M. Hawley,  Ignacio E. Lozano Jr., Samuel L. Williams, Donn B. Tatum and Charles E. Cobb  Jr.  </P> <P> The name of Roy E. Disney, a nephew of Walt Disney, also has been injected into  the pretrial proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorney J. Michael Hennigan told Judge  Soven on Friday that Milken's personal relationship with Roy Disney, and  subsequently with Steinberg, marked the beginning of Steinberg's move against  the Disney company.  </P> <P> Roy Disney, who held a major interest in the firm, resigned as a company  director in March, 1984, amid rumors he was considering a takeover effort.  Shortly afterward, Steinberg disclosed a 6.3% holding in Disney stock, which  later was doubled. Roy Disney said at the time of the tender offer that he was  not part of Steinberg's group. Eleven days after Steinberg's stock was  purchased by the company, Roy Disney rejoined the board.  </P> <P> An unusual aspect of the case is that it involves a simultaneous trial of two  lawsuits with conflicting goals. The suits were consolidated because they  involve the same set of circumstances.  </P> <P> In the class action, some Disney shareholders -- alleging breaches in fiduciary  duty by the company's directors, by Steinberg and by some of the New York  raider's advisers -- claim the Steinberg profit fund because they lost money  when they sold their stock after the price collapsed following the buyout of  Steinberg's interest.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lengthy Maneuvering  </P> <P> However, in a so-called derivative suit on behalf of the Disney company, other  Disney stockholders assert that the money should go to the movie company.  </P> <P> For five years, the case has been the subject of pretrial maneuvering. In  recent weeks, under rules of the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the parties  held mandatory settlement talks but failed to settle the dispute. The case has  now been assigned for trial, with jury selection expected to start Wednesday.  Lawyers estimate the trial may run for nine weeks.  </P> <P> Some 20 lawyers crowded into the courtroom late last week to start preliminary  proceedings. Judge Soven noted that she had no prior knowledge that the case  was being assigned and that she had "12 feet" of records piled in her office.  Then she began a process of dealing with a host of pretrial motions.  </P> <P> After the jury is picked, the members will start hearing the parties' opening  statements about the case. Besides alleging that all defendants breached a  fiduciary duty to the Disney shareholders, the plaintiffs contend that  Steinberg, his Reliance Insurance Co. and related companies and Drexel  illegally "aided and abetted" the defendant Disney directors in the alleged  breach. The Steinberg defendants, as well as the Disney group, assert that the  Disney board's actions were fair to the company and its stockholders and that  its judgments were protected by state law.  </P> <P> However, attorneys for the Steinberg group contend that if the court upholds  the claims against them, the group is entitled to a judgment against the Disney  company for its loss.  </P></p>

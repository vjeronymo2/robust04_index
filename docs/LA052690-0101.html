			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH WILL TRY TO REASSURE SOVIETS ON GERMANY, NATO  </P> <P> With the future of a unified Germany shaping up as a central issue in next  week's U.S.-Soviet summit, President Bush has indicated that he will try to  persuade Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that there is "no threat to the  Soviet Union" if Germany remains a member of the North Atlantic Treaty  Alliance.  </P> <P> U.S. officials displayed little alarm at Gorbachev's remarks Friday suggesting  that the Soviet Union might reconsider its participation in conventional arms  talks in Europe if a unified Germany becomes a member of NATO.  </P> <P> While Gorbachev's opposition to German membership in NATO has not shifted, his  comments to a Moscow press conference after a meeting with French President  Francois Mitterrand were seen by non-government experts in the United States as  his most dire warning yet of the consequences of such a step.  </P> <P> Bush, in an interview with French television that was recorded Thursday -- one  day before Gorbachev made his comments -- praised the Soviet president's  handling of the fast-paced changes in Eastern Europe that have brought about  the near-disintegration of the Warsaw Pact.  </P> <P> "Gorbachev has handled up until now change in Eastern Europe with great  ability. And so I will approach him and make my case for a Germany in NATO,"  Bush said, according to a White House transcript made available in  Kennebunkport as the President began a four-day Memorial Day holiday at his  vacation home. "I have to sell him on the fact that this presents no threat to  the Soviet Union."  </P> <P> After reports of Gorbachev's remarks in Moscow reached Administration  officials, the White House said that it would have no comment until a complete  text had been received.  </P> <P> But one Administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said  Gorbachev's comments reflected the increasing pressure the Soviet leader  apparently is feeling as a result of his plans to pull troops out of Hungary,  Poland and Czechoslovakia -- all military allies of the Soviet Union until the  crumbling of their Communist governments.  </P> <P> The official said the demobilization in Eastern Europe presented Gorbachev with  a number of problems, including that of finding housing and work for the  returning troops and what he called the "psychological" problem linked to  shrinking the Soviet Union's military role.  </P> <P> In addition, he pointed out that until last week's meeting in Moscow between  Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.  Shevardnadze, the Soviet military had played a conspicuously limited role in  recent arms control talks.  </P> <P> That was said to have changed dramatically when Gorbachev sought the advice of  a senior general during talks with Baker.  </P> <P> At that meeting, the Administration official said, "the military played an  extremely important role."  </P> <P> Gorbachev's sharp comments were read not only as a signal that tough bargaining  may take place during the Washington summit, but also as a sign that the Soviet  president is playing to a home audience of military professionals who are  increasingly anxious about their future role.  </P> <P> "Going into the summit, we felt that Germany would be the No. 1 issue," the  Administration official said. "It's shaping up to be that."  </P> <P> In Washington, Baker and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher  reaffirmed Friday their support for German membership in NATO.  </P> <P> Talking to reporters before Gorbachev's press conference in Moscow, Baker said  that he and Genscher achieved "an amazing degree of convergence of views" on  German reunification and strategy for the 23-nation Conventional Forces in  Europe talks in Vienna.  </P> <P> After talks with Genscher in Geneva, Shevardnadze said Wednesday that the  Soviet Union wants to complete the conventional forces talks this year. His  optimism seemed to contrast with what the United States and other NATO nations  have termed Soviet foot-dragging in the Vienna talks.  </P> <P> Asked to elaborate, Genscher said Shevardnadze expressed a Soviet desire to  complete the negotiations quickly but did not provide any hint that Moscow was  ready to compromise on artillery, tanks, troop levels and other issues to end  the current deadlock.  </P> <P> Baker said he received from Shevardnadze a similar assurance that Moscow wants  to reach agreement soon in the Vienna talks.  </P> <P> In the French television interview, Bush recognized the enhanced role of the  Soviet military in the negotiations.  </P> <P> Asked whether he thought Gorbachev was being blocked by the military, Bush  replied: "I don't think we know that, but that's certainly a concern. . . .  </P> <P> "But it's not my role to figure out whether Gorbachev is having a problem with  his right or his left; it's mine to deal with what's on the table. And what's  on the table is a strong Soviet leader, clearly in charge, with whom we have a  lot of business items."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Norman Kempster, in Washington, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Arts: Two sopranos - London Promenade Concerts ON Monday night, in an otherwise heavyweight programme (Elgar's Second Symphony and bleeding chunks from Die Meistersinger), Felicity Lott sang Hugo Wolf songs. Six of his best, indeed, and particularly enticing because we were hearing them in their rare orchestral versions: Andrew Davis took the BBC Symphony through them with scrupulous finesse. Though the Albert Hall is not the ideal place for appreciating Wolf's subtleties, the entire set was a pleasure to hear. At least 'Kennst du das Land?' is on a near-operatic scale, especially with Wolf's dramatic orchestra; and the vernal thrills in 'Er ist's' were so vivid as to risk concealing the voice. The charming 'In dem Schatten meiner Locken' should be operatic, since Wolf orchestrated it for use in his opera Der Corregidor - but in practice, the original piano accompaniment can be more teasing and playful than is possible for a whole band. In fact the introspective songs gained most from their new guise. There is nothing fancy in Wolf's orchestrations, but he selected plain timbres to unerring effect: sonorous horns for the benedictory dawn of 'In der Fruhe' (not really a soprano song, though), flutes for the wistful thirds-motif in 'Anakreons Grab'. Morike's little prayer 'Gebet', too, glowed beautifully (just strings, woodwinds and soft horns). As ever, Miss Lott's clean-lined sympathy and poise were faultless. ***** BETWEEN unprepossessing Hamilton (his Concerto for Orchestra) and Dvorak (the Seventh Symphony), the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra's prom on Tuesday provided one of the truly memorable experiences of the current season. Isabelle Vernet sang Berlioz's Les Nuits d'ete with such unfailing sense of line and effortlessly burnished, unforced tone she disarmed all criticism. The accompaniments were handled tactfully by Takuo Yuasa; he recognised there was no need to gild an already resplendent lily.</p>

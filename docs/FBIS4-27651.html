			<p>BFN     [Text] Philippine Congress has approved an amnesty offer  for some 24,000 rebels. In a move hailed by President Ramos as  a step towards ending all armed revolt in the country. The  legislature approved the amnesty submitted to it by Ramos early  this year. The amnesty covers the whole spectrum of rebels who  have plagued the Philippines for years. Many rebel leaders have  rejected the amnesty saying it will not solve basic problems  which caused the rebellion in the first place. The Philippine  Government announced the amnesty in a bid to bring insurgent  groups to the peace tables.</p>

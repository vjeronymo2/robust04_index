			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: UK economy The immediate causes of yesterday's slippage in UK gilts and 42-point fall in the London equity market were to be found abroad. The US trade deficit unsettled New York markets, while Germany worried about the imminent August money supply numbers. At least in gilts, though, the nervousness fits badly with the domestic data. Net new mortgage commitments at building societies fell 7 per cent in August while the fall in retail deposits in the banking system suggests consumers may be squeezed by higher taxation. With recent growth in M4 money supply well within the target range, there seems to be little pressure for a further rate rise. One danger, though, is that markets tend to confuse weakness in consumer demand and housing with weakness in the economy as a whole. The chancellor's decision to raise base rates last week clearly reflected a broader view of the economy in which growth is driven by other things, notably exports. As long as the overall growth rate remains high, the output gap will continue to close and companies will try increasingly to pass on higher input costs. The authorities may thus feel tempted to tighten monetary policy further, but while corporate borrowing remains low the risk is that of overkill. Against that background, gilts look an outright bargain at yields of over 9 per cent, but equities will continue to struggle.</p>

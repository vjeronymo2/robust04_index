			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNTY SANITATION OFFICIALS SETTLE TOXIC DUMPING SUIT FOR $12 MILLION  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Sanitation Districts agreed Thursday to a $12-million  out-of-court settlement with state and federal authorities over the dumping of  tons of toxic chemicals into Los Angeles coastal waters that began as far back  as 40 years ago.  </P> <P> The settlement marked the first time federal and state governments have been  able to collect damages under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation and Liability Act, which makes parties that dispose of waste  responsible for cleaning up and restoring the environment, officials connected  with the case said.  </P> <P> "Today's settlement is an important environmental victory for the people of the  state," Lt. Gov. Leo McCarthy, a member of the State Lands Commission, said  after announcing the decision. "We will not allow our oceans to be treated like  sewers anymore. American people will no longer experience pollution for the  sake of profit."  </P> <P> The settlement with the sanitation districts, a Los Angeles County agency, will  not eliminate legal action against eight companies being sued by the government  for allegedly inflicting damages to marine wildlife and its habitat off the  Southern California coast.  </P> <P> Under the settlement guidelines, officials for the plaintiffs will have access  to the sanitation districts' files documenting dumping by the eight companies  being sued, said districts spokesman Bob Horvath.  </P> <P> The costs of the Sanitation Districts' settlement will be passed on to  taxpayers in the from of a service charge increase, Horvath said. The charges,  currently $50 per year for a single-family home, will most likely increase a  dollar a year for the next six years, Horvath said.  </P> <P> The settlement, which was filed late Wednesday in federal court, follows a  warning issued by the government in January that the sanitation districts and  several California companies could be held liable for environmental damage  caused by the discharge of the pesticide DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls  (PCBs).  </P> <P> Scientists say the two chemicals are highly toxic and cause birth defects in  birds and marine life. The government alleges they were discharged into the Los  Angeles-Long Beach harbors, the Palos Verdes Shelf off Whites Point and at two  dump sites in the San Pedro Channel near Santa Catalina Island.  </P> <P> The sanitation districts agency was named in the lawsuit because it was held  responsible for releasing through its sewer system the toxic chemicals produced  by the eight private companies and dumped into Los Angeles-Long Beach waters,  said Thomas A. Campbell, general counsel for the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, the lead agency in the suit. NOAA, the Interior  Department and three California state agencies worked together on the  settlement, Campbell said. The case was filed by the Justice Department.  </P> <P> The companies named in the suit include Montrose Chemical Corp. and its parent  companies Atkemix 37 Inc., Stauffeur Management Co., ICI American Holdings and  Chris-Craft Industries. They are charged with flushing hundreds of tons of DDTs  into the storm drainage system of Los Angeles County and, ultimately, into the  Pacific Ocean, Campbell said.  </P> <P> The suit also charges Westinghouse Electric Corp., Potlatch Corp. and Simpson  Paper Co. with similar activities involving PCBs, Campbell said.  </P> <P> Although the discharge of the chemicals occurred as long as 40 years ago,  McCarthy said the effects can be seen today. The dumping made some local fish  dangerous to eat and threatened the existence of wildlife such as the bald  eagle and the peregrine falcon, McCarthy said.  </P> <P> Horvath said the settlement provided a way for the districts to address and  improve pollution problems as well as the opportunity to shoulder  responsibility for its actions.  </P> <P> Under terms of the deal, the districts will assist in assessing the extent of  natural-resources damage and contribute to restoration of the natural resources  once a restoration plan is approved. The districts value these services and  contributions at over $12 million.  </P></p>

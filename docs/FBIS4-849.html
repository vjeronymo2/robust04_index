			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Manuel da Conceicao in Lusaka] </F>   [Text] Today the mediator only met with the National Union  for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] delegation, which  submitted a document containing its views on the conclusion of  the elections. UNITA proposed the reinstatement of state  administration throughout Angola, guarantees, security, and  freedom of expression for citizens, and the resumption of air  and ground links with a view to ensuring the free movement of  people and goods nationwide. A national electoral commission  will be responsible for preparing the elections, and the United  Nations will monitor the situation to determine whether  conditions have been created to hold the second round of  presidential elections.    It is believed that the UNITA document has been referred to  the government delegation. The meeting between Chief Beye and  UNITA lasted a long time, with Alioune Blondin Beye having to  postpone for tomorrow the meeting he had scheduled with the  government delegation. Today the government delegation met to  discuss internal issues relating to the Ad Hoc Commission.</p>

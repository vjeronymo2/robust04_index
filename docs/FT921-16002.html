			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading HEFTY premiums in the financial futures market ensured considerable selling pressure and subsequent volatility yesterday, writes Peter John. In the cash market, prices were marked up sharply at the opening to catch any panicky buyers who had missed out on the Christmas holiday rises. As a result the Footsie future for March delivery jumped some 37 points. This left it at a 52-point premium to cash and some 24 points above its estimated fair value. It was at an ideal level for the arbitrageurs, who moved in and brought the price and the premium back down. March closed at 2,533, with 8,265 contracts dealt and the premium reduced to 41 points. The gap between cash and the Footsie future was also narrowed by a large trade in the traded options market. One UK investment bank sold 2,000 of the March 2,400 calls at around 180. The same house also carried out a large 'buy-write' trade in Cadbury options, ensuring it was the day's most active stock option with 2,309 lots dealt. It sold, or wrote, 1,000 May 460 calls at 25 and bought stock in the market. The two trades helped total turnover to reach a still uninspiring 24,672 contracts.</p>

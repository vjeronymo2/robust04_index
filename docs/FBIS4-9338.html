			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jaroslav Kmenta: "The Army Tested Small Pox"] </F>   [Text] Prague -- Although only a month ago army officials  kept quiet about the small pox virus ever having been studied in  Czechoslovakia, the army admitted yesterday that military  scholars worked with this dangerous virus in the 1960's and  1970's. Moreover, according to the former employees of the  Military Health Institute, the small pox virus has never been  destroyed.    There was no small pox virus in the viral strain bank that  the army liquidated last February, while, according to  information available, it was not destroyed in the 1980's  either. So far, none of the army or civilian officials we asked  has explained what has actually happened to the small pox virus.    The director of the Central Military Health Institute,  Vladimir Radovnicky, believes that the virus was destroyed  between 1976 and 1978. "The small pox virus strain (variola  maior) was here once, because there is a diagnostic serum. It  was a problem of the 1970's. The strain was probably destroyed.  Nevertheless, I cannot give a definite answer of when and how  it was destroyed. I can only confirm that the small pox virus  was not in the strain bank that was destroyed earlier this year.  It would be hard for me to trace what happened in the 1960's and  1970's," he said. He then emphasized that there is no viral  strain, even less the small pox one, in his institute now.    A former employee of the same institute, who wishes to  remain  anonymous, and who used to work with the small pox viruses,  asserted that, after the small pox research was concluded in the  1970's, the strain was frozen in liquid nitrogen and placed in a  special container.    In 1979, when thanks to the world-wide systematic  inoculation, small pox was completely suppressed, the General  Commission for Elimination of Small Pox recommended that all  remaining stock of small pox virus be either destroyed or  transferred to reference laboratories in the United States and  the USSR. "We have not respected the research recommendation by  the world commission out of laziness, rather than out of bad  intentions," the former staffer of the research laboratory  admitted.</p>

			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Hewlett-Packard ahead at Dollars 408m Hewlett-Packard, the US computer and electronics manufacturer, reported strong growth for its second fiscal quarter as it continued to outperform its largest competitors in the computer market. Net earnings for the quarter, ended April 30, were Dollars 408m, or Dollars 1.56 a share, compared with Dollars 347m, or Dollars 1.38, in the same period last year. An adjustment for employee stock options reduced earnings per share by 4 cents in the latest quarter. Revenues rose 23 per cent to Dollars 6.3bn from Dollars 5.1bn in the second quarter of fiscal 1993. Net revenue in the US was Dollars 2.8bn, an increase of 26 per cent, while revenue from outside the US was Dollars 3.5bn, up 20 per cent. 'Overall we had a very good quarter,' said Mr Lewis Platt, chairman, president and chief executive. 'Our revenue and order growth were outstanding in today's challenging environment, and our earnings improved nicely over last year's strong second quarter.' Orders booked during the quarter rose 19 per cent to Dollars 6.4bn, compared with Dollars 5.4bn in the second quarter of 1993. US orders were Dollars 2.9bn, up 25 per cent, while those from outside the US rose 13 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn. Order growth was 'excellent' in Asia Pacific, but declined in Europe. In the computer business, revenues increased by 21 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 4.9bn from Dollars 3.9bn. Orders for PCs increased dramatically, the company said, while orders for HP's popular Deskjet PC printers also grew strongly. Growth in orders for laser printers was 'modest and in line with company expectations'. Multi-user computer orders continued to grow strongly, but workstation orders declined in value. The test and measurement business achieved 16 per cent order growth, its biggest increase in many years. Orders for communications-test equipment, as well as semiconductor and printed-circuitboard test systems, increased strongly. As a percentage of net revenue, cost of goods sold increased to 62.2 per cent from 58.8 per cent in the year-ago quarter reflecting competitive pricing pressures and a continuing shift toward products with higher sales costs. Operating expenses for the quarter increased 12 per cent over the year-ago period, with R&amp;D spending up 16 per cent. However, as a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 27.6 per cent, down from 30.3 per cent a year ago. For the six months ended April 30, net earnings increased 28 per cent to Dollars 776m, against Dollars 608m in the first half of 1993. Net earnings per share totalled Dollars 2.98, an increase of 24 per cent over the Dollars 2.41 in last year's first half. Net revenue rose 23 per cent to Dollars 11.9bn. 'We still face intense competition, a mixed economic environment worldwide and rapid change in the marketplace in all our businesses,' Mr Platt said.</p>

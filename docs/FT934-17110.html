			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / International Company News: Goldsmith buys stake in Australia goldminer SIR James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier, yesterday emerged as a surprise investor in Bendigo Mining, a small Australian goldminer which controls one of the country's most historically productive fields. Sir James gave the gold price a fillip earlier this year when he sold a stake in Denver-based Newmont Mining to Mr George Soros, the international investor. Bendigo Mining, based in Victoria, announced that the bulk of a ADollars 10m (USDollars 6.5m) share placement was being taken up by interests associated with either Sir James, or with Consolidated Press, the private company controlled by Mr Kerry Packer, the Australian businessman. Bendigo is issuing 20m new shares at 50 cents each to raise ADollars 10m. Yesterday it said Sir James would take 7.5m shares, at a cost of ADollars 3.75m, while Consolidated Press would take a similar number. The remaining 5m shares would be sold to institutions. The purchase will give Sir James a 5.3 per cent stake in the company. Consolidated Press will hold a similar interest. Mr Packer had been a Bendigo shareholder previously. He sold his former interest in June. Sir James and Mr Packer are friends, and have had business associations in the past. Mr Packer, for example, was an important figure in the Goldsmith-led consortium which mounted a Pounds 13bn (Dollars 19.4bn) bid for the UK's BAT Industries in 1989, while Mr Al Dunlap, managing director of Consolidated Press until last February, previously worked at Sir James' Crown Zellerbach timber group in the US. Historically, Bendigo is Australia's second most productive goldfield, eclipsed only by Kalgoorlie's famous 'Golden Mile'. However, mining halted at the Victorian field in the 1950s.</p>

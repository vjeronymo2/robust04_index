			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / Washington seeks to prevent more rioting WIDESPREAD rioting and looting - for the second night running in the predominantly Hispanic area of Mount Pleasant in Washington, about two miles from the White House - led to the imposition of a curfew and a state of emergency across both that area and that of Adams Morgan between midnight Monday and early yesterday morning. The disturbances have involved gangs of youths breaking shop windows and looting, fires, destruction of vehicles, and running skirmishes with a thousand police officers who fired tear gas. Calm prevailed yesterday as Mayor Sharon Pratt Dixon gathered her top administrators to discuss ways to prevent a third night of rioting. Deputy Police Chief Edward Spurlock said the disturbances were the worst in Washington since 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King jr, the black civil rights leader. The violence, though contained within a few hundred square yards, crossed 16th Street, one of the city's main arteries, and came within walking distance of the main residential, tourist and office areas. For most Washingtonians, however, the main evidence of the riots was the live coverage on television, the screams of fire and ambulance sirens and heavy activity by low-flying police helicopters. The disturbances followed the shooting of a Hispanic man by a police officer who was trying to detain him for public drinking. According to the police, the man, now in a critical condition, drew a knife. According to a Hispanic witness, he was handcuffed when shot. This triggered the waves of violence against both property and the police on Sunday and Monday evenings in the Mount Pleasant and Adams Morgan areas. The latest events have underlined simmering tensions between the generally poor Hispanic community and the District of Columbia government and police force, which are predominantly black and, as such, reflect the city's racial composition. The tensions in Washington between Hispanics and blacks have been matched in other US cities, such as Miami, Los Angeles and Houston, where there are large Spanish-speaking populations, often made up of recent immigrants, who argue that they are badly treated and often excluded from power. Following the first night's riots, local residents told Ms Dixon that Hispanic people were harassed by the police and poorly treated by city agencies. Less than 4 per cent of the police are Hispanic, compared with at least 10 per cent of the city's population. Many of the Hispanics are recent refugees from central America and speak only Spanish. Ms Dixon promised to improve communications and said district agencies would hire more Hispanic people. This is her first big test since she took over four months ago from Mayor Marion Barry, who, despite his drug and alcohol problems, proved to be a wily operator in reducing conflicts in the city. Sharon Pratt Dixon, mayor of Washington, who sometimes carries a broom as token of her determination to clean up the city administration, has promised more help for local Hispanics</p>

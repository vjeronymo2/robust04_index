			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Ambassador to Zaire Etienne </F> Sengegera by correspondent Ntumba Matulu in Kinshasa; date not  given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Sengegera] Well, first we had indirect  information, but we have also managed to open direct contacts  with the authorities for information on developments in Rwanda,  which aids us in our work at the embassy level. So I am in  contact with those Rwandan authorities who are trying to manage  this tragic and critical situation into which we were plunged on  6 April.    Obviously, the latest news is that fighting continues,  notably in Kigali but also at the northern front -- the border  with Uganda. The so-called Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF], I must  state, is supported by foreign powers, notably Uganda, which  supplies it with equipment and which gives it logistical  support. Apart from Uganda's involvement in the war, other  powers also are involved in this war, and I am not scared of  citing Belgium in this regard. We have all the evidence now to  declare this without any conjecture, as Belgian soldiers shot  down the Rwandan presidential plane on that fatal night of 6  April.    Belgian soldiers supposedly on a peace mission in Rwandan --  they belonged to the United Nations Assistance Mission to Rwanda  [UNAMIR] -- three Belgian soldiers supposedly on a peace mission  shot down the Rwandan presidential plane with missiles. First  they shot a missile that missed the target; the second missile  slightly touched the aircraft; and the third, unfortunately, hit  its target. The aircraft exploded, and this resulted in an  incredible catastrophe that nobody could have imagined.  Therefore, certain Belgians elements were involved.    [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, this is a very serious accusation.  What reasons could have prompted the Belgians to support the RPF?    [Sengegera] The motives of the Belgians or, to be more  precise, of certain Belgians? You will have to ask these people  themselves. But the fact is that I am not leveling an  accusation -- I am only making an observation. This is because  it was Belgians -- three UNAMIR Belgian soldiers -- who shot  down the Rwandan presidential plane with missiles. We do not  know their motives or interests -- you would have to ask those  persons themselves -- but we are now convinced that behind the  war that the RPF is imposing on Rwanda to seize power by force,  are certain Belgian circles that are involved for reasons  unknown to us. We might also make a geostrategic analysis of  the war, saying that Rwanda probably is not the only country  that has been targeted. So, you might as well question the  Belgians as to what the rebels' motives are. Everybody knows  that the rebels are not interested in the democratization of  Rwanda. They are interested in taking power by force.    [Matulu] What prompts you to think that it is the Belgians  and the Ugandans who are behind the rebels?    [Sengegera] The case of Uganda has been proven, because the  attack on Rwanda on 1 October 1990 was perpetrated by elements  who illegally came from the Army of President Museveni. They  attacked us with full logistical support from the Ugandan Army.  Subsequent attacks were supported by Uganda, sometimes with the  direct intervention of Ugandan soldiers, which seems to be the  present case in this current phase of the war. Concerning the  Belgians, we note the shift in their policy towards Rwanda, to  the point of undertaking this shameful and ignominious plot  against the heads of state -- against President Habyrarimana and  his Burundian counterpart. There may be other interested  parties in the plot who we have not discovered, but certain  Belgians -- I repeat certain Belgians -- are involved in the  current war imposed on Rwanda. I would also like to stress that  in the current clashes in Kigali there have been found in  certain localities the dead bodies of some white foreign  nationals who were killed as they fought alongside the RPF.    [Matulu] Yes, but tell me, why do you maintain that it is  the  Belgians who shot down the plane, especially three Belgian  soldiers? And what evidence have you to substantiate this?    [Sengegera] The evidence? First there is the place from  which the missiles were shot.    [Matulu] From where were the missiles shot?    [Sengegera] They were shot from near the Kanombe Airport,  from a place called Massaka, near Kanombe Airport. So, we  spotted where the shots came from, and I can even confirm that  the three were immediately arrested by UNAMIR police and  collected by the Rwandan Army. Another fact: Security at  Kanombe International Airport in Kigali was ensured by the  Belgian contingent, in line with the UNAMIR peace mission. So,  you see, at this level there was a lot of complicity. I am also  telling you that at the landing strip the pilot of the  presidential plane was told to fly around twice because -- I  don't know -- the plot was probably still being prepared, but  the pilot thought that this was for technical reasons, whereas  it was for other sinister designs.    [Matulu] Are the three Belgians soldiers who were arrested  still alive?    [Sengegera] They were immediately shot dead by the angry  Rwandan soldiers.    [Matulu] So, you are saying that they were among the 10  Belgian UN peacekeepers who were killed a few minutes after the  assassination -- to repeat your own words -- of the two  presidents.    [Sengegera] Indeed, the three were among the dozen Belgian  soldiers killed in Kigali during this outburst of violence. It  seems, I repeat seems, that Belgium organized special funeral  rights for three soldiers last week, and I think that it was  these three soldiers who carried out the attack on Presidents  Habyarimana and Ntaryamira.    [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, according to reports, Belgium is  said to have sold arms to the RPF. As the legal representative  of the Rwandan Government, do you have this same information?    [Sengegera] I have received the same information, but have  not been able to verify it myself because really it is not this  piece of information that interests me, as far as my work is  concerned. However, it seems the RPF has bought huge quantities  of military equipment from Belgium on credit. This might  probably explain a certain attitude by Belgium, which considers  that if the RPF does not come into power, we will be done for,  if you excuse me the expression, so, we cannot be paid back.  This may partially explain what has been done.    But, as I said, there are probably other objectives that are  not directed just at Rwanda, as far as the attitude and position  of the Belgians are concerned. There is also another point that  does not surprise us. You know, Belgium has just withdrawn its  contingent from the UNAMIR mission, but the Belgians at first  strongly insisted that they should be supported on the ground  with armor, helicopters, and a huge deployment of forces. Kigali  airport was in their hands and functioning. One wonders whether  this evacuation plan by land toward Tanzania was not to serve as  a support operation for the RPF. But obviously, the Rwandan  Government, which was conscious of the danger, strongly opposed  this. They left by air as it happened, because we thought the  worst might happen. Perhaps the Belgians were even planning a  scenario that is not [word indistinct] from the earlier one --  cut the (Rufumo) Bridge, which links us with Tanzania and which  has since October 1990 virtually been the only land route for  international trade exchanges for Rwanda and Zaire. [passage  omitted]    [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, we have this information -- which  is  not a rumor -- that the Belgians are sympathetic to the RPF and  that this led the Belgians to facilitate the infiltration of RPF  soldiers into Kigali, the Rwandan capital? Can you confirm this?    [Sengegera] Yes I can confirm this. There are many Belgians  who are married to Rwandans, and this may sometimes explain this  sympathetic attitude on the part of the Belgians. Apart from  this, I would like to recall that it was agreed under the Arusha  Accord that the RPF was authorized to station a contingent of  600 soldiers in Kigali on the premises of the parliament in  Kigali. These fighters were supposedly in Rwanda in line with  the mission to protect and ensure the security of the RPF  political leaders who were to participate in the transition, in  both the new government and in parliament. But we realized that  in fact this battalion was getting bigger and bigger due to  infiltrations facilitated by the Belgian contingent of the  UNAMIR. They sent convoys to their headquarters in the north of  the country near the Ugandan border in Mulindi, supposedly to  get wood supplies, but in fact they brought back artillery -- or  rather soldiers -- who were infiltrated into Kigali. This  occurred to the extent that certain sources reported that the  RPF did not have 600 fighters in Kigali, but instead more like  3,000 soldiers. [passage omitted]    [Matulu] Mr. Ambassador, it seems that on the ground -- I do  not know if you have some information on this -- the RPF has the  upper hand?    [Sengegera] That is just media publicity. I think that this  is misinformation to try and demoralize people. This situation  is different from the presentations in the Western media,  notably with all the noise and manipulations orchestrated by  certain Western journalists who favor the RPF. The situation is  quite different on the ground. The RPF does not control....  [pauses] Sometimes, we were even told that the RPF had managed  to bring down 20,000 soldiers to join their battalion in the  capital. That is not true. The RPF only controls one strategic  position in Kigali. We have dislodged them from all the major  positions which they were able to occupy. Of course, the  situation is constantly changing, but as we speak now the  Rwandan Armed Forces control the situation both in Kigali and in  the north of the country near the Ugandan border.    [Matulu] Well, Mr. Ambassador, Tanzanian President Ali  Hassan  Mwinyi has just offered to mediate between the interim  government and the RPF. How do you view prospects for this  mediation?    [Sengegera] The Rwandan authorities will accept any  arrangements which might contribute to the restoration of peace  in Rwanda. It is in this context that they are prepared to  consider whether the proposal made by the Tanzanian leader will  succeed. We can also think of other political and more  consistent interventions, notably through the Economic Community  of Great Lakes Countries. The doors are open, but I would like  to point out that concerning efforts for a cease-fire, the RPF  has adopted the strategy of bidding higher every day, even  refusing cease-fire proposals made by UNAMIR. We, the Rwandan  authorities, are open to dialogue which would lead to the return  of peace in Rwanda and the restoration of a true climate of  peace. So, the Tanzanian offer is welcome in that context  without excluding other possible mediation offers, which could  be made at other levels by the true friends of Rwanda.    [Matulu, interrupting] Thank you. One last question, please.    [Sengegera, interrupting] Concerning efforts to pacify the  country, I would like to stress that one of the cardinal  missions assigned to the interim government is to ensure --  after this unfortunate criminal plot which decapitated our  country and the resulted in the tragic death of Prime Minister  Uwilingiyimana -- a return to peace in Rwanda. A government has  been formed and the president of the Republic assumed office in  line with the June 1991 Rwandan Constitution, which legalized  multiparty politics in our country. The interim government has  six weeks to work for peace in Rwanda, but of course we cannot  make the peace by ourselves. We will try to make peace with  those who are at war with us, and who are fighting with the  support of Uganda and other foreign powers.</p>

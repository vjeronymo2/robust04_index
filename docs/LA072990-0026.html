			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A WAY TO CUT UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRATION -- BUT IT'S NOT A QUICK CURE;  </P> <P> TRADE: ONLY SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH OVER DECADES CAN KEEP WORKERS AT HOME.  AMERICA CAN HELP BY FREEING UP ITS TRADE IN THE HEMISPHERE.  </P> <P> Recent developments along the U.S.-Mexico border highlight the continuing  controversy and volatile emotions swirling around undocumented immigration.  </P> <P> Two years ago, we visited the Los Angeles and San Diego areas to assess how the  Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 had affected the volume of  undocumented immigrants coming into this country. More recently, we have heard  discussions about using a San Diego SWAT team to protect undocumented  immigrants. We have also learned of the Alliance for Border Control's "Light Up  the Border" protests against the continuing flow of immigrants.  </P> <P> It is understandable that communities most directly affected by a problem will  strive for immediate answers. But neither initiative will have any effect on  the causes nor the long-term implications of undocumented immigration.  Americans have long relied on short-term enforcement measures to control  immigration. Only recently have long-term efforts been undertaken.  </P> <P> In addition to its employer sanctions and amnesty provisions, the immigration  act created the Commission for the Study of International Migration and  Cooperative Economic Development. Its task was to study the conditions that  give rise to undocumented immigration from Mexico and other countries in the  Western Hemisphere and to recommend "mutually beneficial . . . trade and  investment" measures to alleviate them.  </P> <P> In its report, issued Tuesday, the commission found that although there are  other important factors, the search for economic opportunity is the primary  reason that unauthorized immigrants come to the United States. This is  particularly true for Mexicans.  </P> <P> Paradoxically, while job-creating economic growth is the ultimate solution to  reducing such migratory pressures, it tends, in the short-to-medium term, to  add to these pressures by raising expectations and enhancing people's ability  to migrate. Still, it is the only way to keep workers from crossing borders in  search of greater economic opportunities.  </P> <P> Toward this end, the commission made numerous recommendations. It is clear that  the migrant-sending countries must be primarily responsible for creating  economic opportunity for their own people. Mexico and other countries have  launched ambitious economic programs to accomplish this. But the United States  must adjust certain policies, especially on trade, to help these countries  sustain economic growth.  </P> <P> Expanded access to the markets of the United States and other industrialized  nations through increasingly free trade is the most promising stimulus to  future economic growth in Mexico and other migrant-sending countries. Mexico  shares this belief. All year, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been  saying "we must export goods, or we will continue indefinitely to export  people" in his push for free trade between Mexico and the United States. During  his visit to Washington in June, he and President Bush agreed to prepare for  trade negotiations.  </P> <P> Salinas' free-trade proposal was motivated, in part, by his concern that  developments in both Eastern and Western Europe may divert the attention and  resources of the industrialized countries away from Mexico -- and the rest of  Latin America and the Caribbean. The United States may be similarly affected,  though President Bush's recent proposals on Latin American trade, investment  and debt issues hold out the prospect of a North American and, eventually,  hemisphere-wide free-trade zone. Private business organizations such as the  Council of the Americas, the U.S.-Mexico Business Council and the Assn. of  American Chambers of Commerce in Latin America are working on this.  </P> <P> Immigrants, the commission reported, have consistently rejuvenated and  revitalized American society, and they will continue to do so. But the plight  of undocumented immigrants who, forced by economic or other circumstances to  seek better lives away from home, are almost by definition subject to  exploitation is worrisome. The constant violation of our laws implicit in the  continuing flow of undocumented immigrants into the United States is equally  troubling. It was the commission's hope that fostering growth in  migrant-sending countries would eliminate the need to enforce our immigration  laws.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the United States, as Salinas has implied, is in the unenviable  position of having to choose between accepting goods and services from its  southern neighbors that may temporarily affect our own domestic industry and  labor force, or of countenancing unauthorized traffic in human beings that  harms our laws, our communities and our resources. While there are other  remedies, trade is the only short-term alternative that offers hope to people  in a region characterized by a broad spectrum of economic growth. Financial  assistance, even if it were available in the amounts needed, would not be  nearly as effective. Moreover, expanded trade with hemispheric nations should  produce more jobs and greater prosperity in the United States.  </P> <P> President Salinas' proposal for free trade between the United States and Mexico  and President Bush's broader initiative on Latin American trade, investment and  debt issues are worthy of support. But this support must recognize the major  paradox reported by the commission -- that economic development tends, at  first, to stimulate migration. Judgment on the success of economic growth as a  solution to unauthorized immigration must thus be withheld for decades.  </P> <P> If the United States is to cooperate with migrant-sending countries in a  long-term search to solve the immigration problem, it must be steadfast in  purpose and dedication over a great many years. If this is understood, the  commission will have fulfilled its mandate, and the flow of undocumented  immigrants will gradually diminish as more and better jobs are created for them  at home.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Li Jianxing (2621 1696 5281) and </F> XINHUA reporter Fu Gang (0265 0474)]    [Text] Beijing, 21 Jan (XINHUA) -- At today's national  meeting on auditing work, State Councillor Li Guixian said: The  Constitution stipulates that under the State Council's  leadership, auditing organizations independently carry out  supervising power according to law without interference from any  other administrative organization, social group, or individual.  The faster the drive of reform and opening up to the outside  world is conducted, the more effective auditing supervision  should be.    Li Guixian continued: Auditing supervision is of great  importance in the socialist modernization drive. Whether or not  the central authorities' macroeconomic regulation and control  measures are conscientiously implemented depends on the  supervision of supervision departments, and particularly  auditing departments, at all levels, although auditing  departments themselves do not formulate such measures. Auditing  departments should supervise economic administrations, local  governments, and state-owned enterprises and institutions in  their implementation of state policies by auditing their  financial management and affairs. Auditing departments should  also reflect in a timely manner problems existing during the  course of implementation to facilitate the implementation of the  macroeconomic regulation and control measures adopted by the  central authorities.    Li Guixian said: The focus of auditing work this year should  be shifted to providing services to macroeconomic regulation and  control. Therefore, in carrying out auditing supervision,  attention should be paid to the following three aspects: First,  auditing supervision over the state's financial revenue and  expenditure should be strengthened. At present, our country's  financial situation is relatively difficult but there is great  potential to increase revenue and cut down expenditures.  Auditing departments should deal with such problems as seeking  departmental and regional interests regardless of financial and  economic laws and disciplines. They should help financial,  taxation, and other departments do a good job in managing and  utilizing the state's funds. Second, auditing supervision over  the departments in charge of state-owned assets should be  strengthened. Some state-owned enterprises have serious  problems including poor economic performance, incorrect  statement of losses and benefits, and losses of state-owned  assets. By auditing state-owned enterprises and departments in  charge of state-owned assets, auditing departments should help  them strengthen management, enhance economic returns, and ensure  the maintaining and increasing of the value of state-owned  assets. Third, auditing supervision over governmental  departments in their financial revenue and expenditures should  be strengthened. It is necessary to treat this task as an  important matter in the anticorruption campaign and in building  a clean government. Particular efforts should be made to  strengthen financial audits of governmental organizations and  law enforcement, judicial, and economic administrations. If  squandering, wasting, and seeking private gains through power as  well as arbitrary requisition of donations, exaction of fees  from enterprises, and other unhealthy trends of trade and  profession are found, serious measures should be taken.</p>

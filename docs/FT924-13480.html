			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sees modest fall after erratic trading Wall Street US STOCK markets ended a see-saw day with modest losses yesterday as investors continued to digest the latest round of third quarter corporate results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.94 at 3,195.48. After opening lower, the index recovered to post a 15-point gain by early afternoon, before selling in the futures market sent it to a 20-point decline at 3.30pm, a decline that was only partially reversed in the last few minutes of trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.02 firmer at 409.32, while the Amex composite eased 0.66 to 366.17 and the Nasdaq composite fell 0.21 to 576.23. Turnover on the NYSE was 174m shares. Losses in Tokyo, London and other European markets set the tone for a downbeat opening in New York, and after two days of substantial gains, there was no real resistance to early selling, mainly by European investors. The release of the latest economic news - a 0.3 per cent rise in both retail sales and producer prices during September - had little impact on sentiment. As some more good third quarter corporate earnings figures came in, shares soon regained the ground lost in the first half-hour, but amid continued uncertainty about the economic, political and earnings outlook prices fluctuated wildly for the remainder of the session. One of the best corporate stories of the day was Coca-Cola, which climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 1/2 in turnover of 1.7m shares after the soft drinks giant announced third quarter profits of 41 cents a share, up from 34 cents a share a year ago. The company also said it was 'on track' for 'very strong' earnings for the full year. Pepsico, which also reported strong quarterly profits on Tuesday, was firmer, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39. Bank of New York rose Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 44 5/8 in busy trading after the bank reported a 66 per cent rise in earnings to Dollars 1.07 a share. Another regional banking group, Republic New York, was unchanged at Dollars 43 after news that it had won approval from the Federal Reserve to conduct full-service securities brokerage business through a subsidiary. International Paper fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 after the broking house, Dean Witter Reynolds, lowered its rating on the stock from a 'hold' to a 'swap' to reflect the postponement of price increases for linerboard and uncoated free sheet paper. On the Nasdaq market, selected leading technology issues were higher, with Apple up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 46 and Borland International up Dollars 1 5/8 at 29 5/8 . Canada TORONTO share prices closed lower in moderate trading, following the trend set in major world markets. According to preliminary data, the 300 composite index lost 19.46 points, or 0.61 per cent, to close at 3,195.39. Declines led advances by 304 to 201, volume of 23.6m shares was below the previous 24.5m, and trading value was CDollars 215.6m against CDollars 183.6m.</p>

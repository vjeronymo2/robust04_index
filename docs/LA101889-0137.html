			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> INVESTOR SUES IRVINE-BASED NEC  </P> <P> A New York investor has filed a class-action lawsuit against National Education  Corp. of Irvine and its top executives, charging them with promulgating false  and misleading information about the NEC's financial condition between July 20  and Oct. 6, 1989.  </P> <P> NEC, a one-time high-flier in the vocational training and education business,  has been reeling since last spring from problems at its Applied Learning  subsidiary. On Oct. 5, the company announced that it expected a $6-million loss  for the third quarter and that was having trouble with financing. The company's  stock lost more than 30% of its value the next day.  </P> <P> The suit charges that NEC concealed the problems at Applied Learning and made  false, optimistic statements about the company's financial condition in order  to inflate the stock price. NEC was the target of a similar shareholder lawsuit  filed in June after the company said it would have flat or declining earnings  for the second quarter.  </P> <P> An NEC attorney said the company would vigorously defend itself against the  allegations.  </P></p>

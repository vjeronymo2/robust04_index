			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on news conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler </F> at IEC headquarters in Midrand on 29 April]    [Text] IEC [Independent Electoral Commission] chairman,  Justice Johann Kriegler, has described the election as an  outstanding success despite the hitches that occurred in some  areas. He outlined the next process in the election -- namely,  the counting of votes -- an a news conference at the IEC  headquarters in Midrand a short while ago.    [Begin Kriegler recording] We can't actually commence  counting in areas where the voting has been completed before  voting has ended in the other six areas. It is not proper to  have counting while there is still voting on the go, because it  may affect the view of voters. In the second instance, the  addition of an extra day in those six areas has required a  change in our counting procedures. The third-day votes have to  be kept separate; they will be counted but they have to be kept  separate. That infers a fairly complex change in instructions  to some 700 voting stations around the country. And then  thirdly of course, many of the people engaged in the voting  process, the voting officers, are also to be involved in the  counting process, and because they're still engaged in the first  phase they're simply not available yet for the second phase.  What this means, further, is that in the counting procedure we  have to be especially careful and meticulous. That will be time  consuming. Moreover, the administrative shortcomings which  resulted in last minute urgent adjustments by the IEC, will  undoubtedly result, and has to some extent already resulted in  political parties raising objections -- to a greater extent  which otherwise has been the case. The determination of those  objections which are relevant to the counting or the ultimate  allocation phase is also time consuming. This means in a  nutshell, that we must be patient. We have come a tremendously  long way; it's gone astoundingly well around the country. [end  recording]</p>

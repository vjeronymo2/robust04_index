			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Costain doubles pre-tax loss COSTAIN Group, the heavily indebted UK construction and mining concern, doubled its pre-tax losses to Pounds 148.6m last year and again passed its final dividend. Had it reported under the FRS 3 accounting standard, which forces extraordinary losses above the line, the pre-tax deficit would have exceeded Pounds 200m. Net assets at the end of December were cut to Pounds 75m, breaching banking covenants. Mr Peter Costain, chief executive, said this would be rectified by the sale of its Australian coal mining business to Hanson, pushing pro forma net assets up to about Pounds 160m. The sale was worth Pounds 198m to Costain - Pounds 157m in payment for the business and Pounds 41m in debt relief. The way was cleared for the disposal less than two weeks ago when an out-of-court settlement was reached with Hanson's Peabody subsidiary. Wrangles broke out last autumn when Costain entertained a rival bid from Altus Finance, part of the French bank Credit Lyonnais. Mr Costain said a consortium of banks, led by NatWest, were being supportive and the group had adequate working capital until March 1995. Net debt rose from Pounds 125m to Pounds 331m last year. The main factors were Pounds 56m of borrowings brought on to the balance sheet for the Spitalfields site in the City of London, and the Pounds 58m impact of adverse currency movements. Debt had increased by Pounds 67.1m since the end of the year. This followed seasonal outflows of cash in the engineering and construction division, more cash absorbed by the Channel tunnel contract and a further negative currency effect of Pounds 21.6m. Mr Costain said the up-to-date net-debt figure, taking account of the sale to Hanson, was about Pounds 210m. 'We are seeking to reduce that by disposals.' These might bring in Pounds 50m this year. Operating profit fell from Pounds 27.4m to Pounds 2.9m on reduced turnover of Pounds 1.24bn. Interest costs were Pounds 18.2m, compared with Pounds 23m. Exceptional charges totalled Pounds 133.3m, mainly for write-downs in the value of housing land, commercial property and mining assets. Mr Costain said Pounds 19m of annual costs had been taken out of the businesses. The workforce had been cut by 1,100 to 4,300. One bright spot was the international order book which had grown to Pounds 177m by February compared with Pounds 49m a year earlier. Details, Page 18</p>

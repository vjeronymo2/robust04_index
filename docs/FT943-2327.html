			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Adams attacks Major's pledge Mr John Major's pledge to submit the outcome of political talks on Northern Ireland's future to a referendum in the province was attacked last night as premature and presumptuous by Mr Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president. His comments came as Mr John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour party, started the first of a series of visits to the US by senior Ulster politicians. Mr Hume, who is likely to meet Mr Al Gore, US vice-president, tomorrow, will be followed by a group of senior Ulster Unionist politicians and almost certainly by Mr Adams. US, Irish and UK officials are understood to have been working behind the scenes to ensure that the visits by Mr Hume and the UUP representatives precede and have a higher profile at official level than that of Mr Adams. The Sinn Fein leader is expected to start his US visit on the west coast next weekend. Meanwhile in Saudi Arabia Mr Major said the IRA was 'very close' to providing acceptable assurances that its open-ended ceasefire was permanent. The prime minister's remarks came three days after he challenged republican leaders to use last week's lifting of the government's broadcasting ban on Sinn Fein to provide the assurances he was looking for. But Sir Patrick Mayhew, speaking in Londonderry, appeared to adopt a sterner note when asked if he was satisfied that IRA violence was over for good. The Northern Ireland secretary said: 'No. I do not think that we have been given that assertion. I can only go upon the words and the deeds of those who have used violence here in Northern Ireland for the last 25 years and killed something like 3,000 people.' Anti-terrorist security at Belfast's largest stores was scaled down yesterday. Staff will no longer frisk customers and search handbags for incendiary bombs.</p>

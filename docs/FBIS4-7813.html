			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Milan Martic, president of the republic of </F> Serbian Krajina, by B.A. and S.C. on 30 March; place not given]    [Text] On Wednesday morning, when it was announced  that the Croats and the Krajina Serbs had signed a cease-fire,  Milan Martic, president of the republic of Serbian Krajina,  responded to NIN's request and answered a few questions by  fax.    [NIN] Do you believe that the U.S. pressure, which resulted  in the creation of a Muslim-Croat Federation, will have a  crucial influence on the further progress of negotiations  between Knin and Zagreb toward the establishment of (con)federal  ties between the republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia?    [Martic] The United States has shown great decisiveness in  taking over the key role in solving the crisis in the area of  the former Yugoslavia. We expect an even more intense  manifestation of the political and diplomatic strength of the  U.S. Administration in the coming period. This will have the  goal of securing a sphere of interest in these Balkan regions.  One cannot say that this will not affect the course of  negotiations between Croatia and Krajina. This tone was already  evident during the first two rounds of negotiations that were  conducted in Zagreb, and in this sense, the United States will  try to keep the initiative. Of course, we also have Russia's  significant role, because it does not wish to be left aside, but  it is clear that at the moment the United States has the leading  role. I think it is still too early to discuss in what way the  U.S. diplomatic initiative can influence the solving of the  Krajina's political status. This latest peace package has three  levels of negotiations. We have practically solved the first  one by signing the agreement on the cessation of hostilities.  This should be followed by negotiations on economic cooperation  and communications, while the solving of the Krajina's political  status has been left for the end. We are ready to participate  in all of these negotiations, in the same way that we are ready  to accept everything that is not in contradiction with the basic  stances of our people and the negotiating platform adopted by  the assembly. In other words, the limit below which we will not  go, not under any kind of pressure, is the people's right to  self-determination, its confirmation in a referendum, that is,  which can even be organized by the international community.    [NIN] How do you explain the announcement that Croatia has  received guarantees from the United States that it will manage  to keep the Republic of Serbian Krajina within the borders of  the former Socialist Republic of Croatia, and Charles Redman's  statement that the United States would recognize Croatian in its  AVNOJ [Antifascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]  borders?    [Martic] The recognition of Croatia by the United States --  of which you speak -- is nothing new. Almost all European  states have recognized Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina with their  AVNOJ borders. Nevertheless, the Republic of Serbian Krajina  has been functioning as an entirely independent and sovereign  state for over three years. Or, to be more precise, there will  be no lasting solution to the Croat-Krajina conflict until both  sides devise a way of sitting down at the negotiating table,  and, starting with the actual situation, try to find some kind  of compromise solution. As far as we are concerned, we have no  special demands on Croatia, and we are ready to cooperate with  it in all spheres that do not threaten the vital interests of  our people.    [NIN] Do you believe that it is possible to solve the  Krajina problem quickly and as part of the same package as  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Martic] At the moment, the most important thing is for the  Croats to honor what they have signed in the Russian Embassy in  Zagreb, and for peace to come to these areas. This will create  conditions for negotiations of an economic and political nature.  What the result of these negotiations will be does not depend  only on us.    [NIN] Do you believe that the establishment of communication  links between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia is  possible before a lasting political solution on the status of  the Republic of Serbian Krajina is achieved?    [Martic] I believe that the defined sequence of solving the  Croat-Krajina conflict is conceptually wrong. The first phase  must in any case be the end of the war and the establishment of  lasting peace. Now that we have signed an agreement on the  cessation of hostilities, and once we implement it, we need to  immediately move on to solving the political relations between  the Republic of Serbian Krajina and Croatia. Once this problem  is solved, issues pertaining to economic cooperation and  communications will not really present a problem. I have  stressed on several occasions that there is no reason why the  Republic of Serbian Krajina should not have cooperate well with  all neighboring countries including Croatia, since this is in  the interest of both sides. My only fear is that the sequence  established now will result in new blockades and the creation of  new crisis points. Experience has taught us that Croatia has so  far always used forceful, unilateral solutions to undermine  everything that has been accomplished regarding the solving of  certain humanitarian problems.    [NIN] How do you see the further progress of talks between  Knin and Zagreb, and which points are currently the most  controversial?    [Martic] So far, we have no reason to be dissatisfied with  the results. If the Croats comply with what was signed in the  Russian Embassy in Zagreb, conditions will be created for  lasting peace and the continuation of negotiations. We expect  that the peace forces will soon take their positions on the  demarcation line established by the maps and thus take over  their real role. In the continuation of negotiations involving  economic issues, we have our conditions that primarily concern  the suspension of Security Council Resolution 820, which places  the Krajina in total economic isolation. Because, you  understand, there is no sense in negotiating about economic  cooperation in conditions where we are not allowed to import or  export, which, in turn, calls into question the state's economic  survival.    [NIN] How would you assess the current political situation  in the republic of Serbian Krajina in view of the fact that the  parliamentary majority has not accepted your proposal that  Borislav Mikelic be the future prime minister?    [Martic] I believe that we are in for a period of more  stable internal relations. The temperature was quite high at  the beginning of the work of the parliament, as a result of the  accumulated political tensions from the time before the  elections and during the first and second electoral rounds. The  climate is gradually changing and as you have had the chance to  hear, a compromise on the future composition of the government  has already been reached. The coalition of the Serbian  Democratic Party of Krajina and the Serbian Radical Party has  already accepted the proposal that the prime minister designate  should be Borislav Mikelic. He is currently conducting all the  necessary consultations concerning the composition of the future  government with representatives of all political parties, and I  am convinced that it will all end in the best possible way.    [NIN] In Belgrade, your statements are interpreted as a hint  that the parliament will be dissolved. Is that at all possible?    [Martic] My address to the public had only one goal -- to  point out the possible consequences of a considerably  destructive trend in the work of the parliament and to  accentuate the necessity of accepting the concept of national  unity. Because, after all, the republic of Serbian Krajina is  at war, and we cannot duplicate on our political scene models  that are valid in states that have had peace for a long time and  where the parliamentary life is developed. My address to the  people and the deputies did not have any other allusions.    [NIN] To what extent do internal disagreements weaken the  position of the republic of Serbian Krajina?    [Martic] I have already said that these disagreements are of  a temporary nature and therefore cannot significantly weaken the  position of the republic of Serbian Krajina. There is complete  political consensus on certain global issues that concern the  future status of our state. This is evident in the good  cooperation of the parliamentary committee for foreign affairs  and the foreign ministry with the negotiating team that  participated in the negotiations in Zagreb.    [NIN] Is there truth in the complaints that the important  cadre positions have been taken by the supporters of members of  the League of Communists -- Movement for Yugoslavia, which to a  certain extent circumvents the electoral results?    [Martic] I do not know where such stories originate or whom  they concretely concern. It is known that so far only the  assembly has been constituted, and that everything was done in  accordance with the wishes of the coalition. The government  still has not been formed, and electoral results will most  certainly be taken into account when choosing cabinet ministers.  Therefore, it is clear that these are just rumors.    [NIN] Do you believe that it will be possible in due course  to reintegrate Yugoslavia in the form of a confederacy, a union,  or a third entity?    [Martic] I do not believe that it will be possible to create  a new Yugoslavia that would be comprised of former republics,  again linked through political links. It is to be expected that  after the war is over, economic, communication, and even  cultural links will be reestablished in the area of the former  Yugoslavia. The strength of these links will depend on the  international community's disposition toward solving political  relations, that is, its readiness to apply the same standards to  all the participants in the crisis in former Yugoslavia. I wish  to stress once more that we ask for nothing more than what the  same international community has granted the other peoples in  former Yugoslavia, and that is to enable us -- in accordance  with the strictest criteria -- to exercise our right to  self-determination.</p>

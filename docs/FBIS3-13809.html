Therefore, first  and foremost, we say the resolution is only a small step in a  direction that will make the UN Security Council begin to assume  its humanitarian and international responsibilities in  accordance with the UN charter, yardsticks, laws, and  international legitimacy resolutions, and start to pass more  serious, effective, clear, credible, and just resolutions in  favor of the just causes of people and against injustice, crime,  aggression, occupation, and the violation of the most basic  human rights.    Let us hope this small step will give the peace process a  push ahead on bases that will open the door to securing  international protection for the Palestinian people. It is very  important and necessary that negotiations continue under the  canopy of a suitable atmosphere propitious for realizing the  required progress and that enhances trust in the peace project  and the possibility of attaining peace.    No doubt, international protection will ward off the threat  of Israeli terrorism and ugly crimes and provide the Palestinian  people with the opportunity to live normal daily lives so they  can pursue their legitimate struggle for independence and  freedom. We say there is no doubt this protection, which still  needs much to become reality, is, alone, now capable of  spreading the appropriate atmosphere and pushing the peace  process ahead with serious steps to attain the required  progress, foremost being the withdrawal of occupation forces  from the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area.    We wait for the UN Security Council resolution to be  translated into practical steps so we can speak with real  optimism. Until this happens, we reiterate that we hope this  small step by the UN Security Council will lead not only to  pushing the peace process ahead but to making the UN Security  Council itself give up the issuance of resolutions in accordance  with double standards and to stop using two different  yardsticks. The just causes of people and their legitimate right  to a free, dignified, and secure life are an indivisible whole.  Injustice cannot be viewed as a relative matter. It is  impermissible to tackle it in accordance with restrictive  political yardsticks. International legitimacy should not open  its eyes here and close them there.    In short, the UN Security Council is now called upon to  review its repressive resolutions against Iraq and the people of  Iraq, resolutions that conflict with the UN charter, laws, and  its famous Universal Declaration on Human Rights. An unjust  embargo is imposed on the fraternal Iraqi people. Since the  beginning this embargo has had nothing to justify it on the  legal, and humanitarian level. It is a very dark and ugly blot  on the history of mankind's civilization that the international  community should expeditiously erase. The international  community must expeditiously remove many dark other blots that  have brought about the endless sufferings of militant people.    Let us really hope this march begins, the march that will  place international legitimacy in the prestigious position it  used to enjoy so it will be possible to respect its resolutions  when they are equitable.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Allies ready to enforce Bosnian no-fly zone: Major says Serbian sanctions may be extended UP TO 100 western aircraft are expected to be deployed this month to enforce the no-fly zone over Bosnia after the United Nations Security Council resolution on Wednesday night approved the operation. US, British, French and possibly Dutch aircraft would be involved in any action aimed at curbing Serb aggression. Nato officials said ambassadors of the 16 allies would meet, perhaps today, to discuss details. The UN resolution takes effect after seven days, and the aircraft could be in place soon after that. Mr John Major, prime minister, told parliament that the government was also discussing with its allies extending sanctions against the Serbs. 'We would be perfectly prepared to contemplate the widening of sanctions as well as stricter enforcement of existing sanctions.' Although his words were welcomed, Mr John Smith, Labour leader, led MPs from all parts of the Commons in expressing concern that sanctions had not, so far, been enforced effectively enough. 'If there is to be a lessening of the sickening events involving innocent women and children, sanctions must be applied much more effectively against Serbia, and the international community must insist that humanitarian convoys are accompanied by military escorts,' Mr Smith said. Some opposition MPs also criticised western governments for failing to enforce the no-fly zone when it was announced last year. Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, called on the government to recommend to other western powers that Srebrenica be protected from the Serbs. Other MPs expressed concern about the safety of British troops involved in the enforcement operation. The German government, meanwhile, will hold an emergency cabinet session today to vote on whether German crews can participate in imposing the no-fly zone. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has interrupted his holiday to chair the session, will insist that German personnel should remain on board Nato surveillance aircraft implementing the UN decision. He has the backing of the Christian Democratic Union, and its sister party, the Christian Social Union. However, the liberal Free Democrats, the junior partner in the coalition, said they would vote against any German crews involved in missions enforcing the UN resolution. They would immediately appeal to the constitutional court. 'As long as the constitutional court has not decided, German troops should not be allowed to remain on board (the Awacs),' Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats, said yesterday. A third of Awacs crews are German. Article 24 of the constitution allows German troops to fight alongside Nato. Since 1949, the federal government has held that the constitution does not allow the deployment of German forces outside the Nato area. But the CDU/CSU has dropped this position as a result of German unification, the break-up of the Warsaw Pact, and the crisis in the former Yugoslavia.

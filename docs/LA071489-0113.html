			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Is This Art, Or What?: An exhibition at the Winnipeg Art Gallery drew  complaints from a woman this week because it included nude photographs of men  by American artist Lucas Samaras. However, after police looked at the exhibit  to determine if it was obscene, they said, "Case closed. The photos don't meet  the definition of obscenity under the criminal code. They may be in bad taste,  but obscene, no." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

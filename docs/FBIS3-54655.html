"Our country has met its targets in both the political and  economic fields. Independent Turkmenistan which chose positive  neutrality to be the overriding principle of its foreign policy  has established itself in the CIS and other international  organizations as a country which follows unswervingly its own  road and has succeeded in reducing the world tension. By its  courageous political and economic steps Ashgabat has on numerous  occasions been in the center of attention," Niyazov said.    He added that it was necessary that relations with  neighboring Iran, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan and Russia  be based on mutual respect and equality.    "We are pleased with establishment of a new level of  relations with the Russian state, he emphasized. When the  Russian president stayed in Turkmenistan we signed important  treaties which will maintain and improve the earlier good  relations with the great neighbor and start equal, mutually  beneficial cooperation."    Niyazov described the introduction of the national currency,  the manat, as one of major events and expressed confidence that  the manat will consolidate in 1994. (The official rate of  exchange is now 601 ruble per manat - IF).    The president also said that the government had developed a  concept of oil and gas production in the country until the year  2020. As its own oil and gas policy are put into effect,  Turkmenistan "will reach the level of developed countries," he  emphasized.    In Niyazov's words, Turkmenistan's armed forces "will never  be the cause of trouble for other countries" but "will not allow  disturbing the peace and well-being in the republic."</p>

			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Australian dollar hit as deficit widens THE Australian dollar came under renewed pressure yesterday, after news that a deteriorating trade balance caused the country's seasonally adjusted current account deficit to widen to ADollars 1.39bn (Pounds 590m) last month. The August figure compared with a ADollars 1.08bn deficit in July. On a non-adjusted basis, the August result showed a deficit of ADollars 1.69bn, up from ADollars 1.53bn in the previous month. Much of the damage resulted from a turnaround on the balance of trade, with exports falling by 4 per cent, while imports increased by 2 per cent. As a result, the trade balance (seasonally adjusted) swung from a surplus of ADollars 128m to a deficit of ADollars 153m. There were marked declines on the export side in transport equipment and coal, as well as gold, machinery, meat and wool; on the import side, fuel showed the sharpest rise. Although analysts had predicted that the trade position would deteriorate after July's surprisingly good results, the August balance of payments data were at the gloomier end of expectations. Bankers Trust had forecast a current account deficit of ADollars 1.15bn, and the market had expected the unadjusted figure to stand in the ADollars 1bn-ADollars 1.3bn range. However, in Canberra, Mr John Dawkins, the Australian treasurer, and Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, both insisted that the figures reflected signs of increased economic growth. On the foreign exchanges, the dollar fell after the figures were released and, by early afternoon, was flirting with a six-and-a-half-year low. By the close the currency had regained a little ground, trading at USDollars 0.646  -down from an opening USDollars 0.647. The dollar has been under pressure for more than a month because of the government's failure to push its budget legislation through the Senate.</p>

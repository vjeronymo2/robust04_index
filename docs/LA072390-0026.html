			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Teshigahara Tribute Hits Snag: The L.A. Festival may have run into snags for  its scheduled Sept. 3 and 4 screenings of Hiroshi Teshigahara's new film,  "Rikyu," which has been billed as the director's "triumphant return to  filmmaking" after an absence of 17 years. An L.A. Festival spokesman said that  the Japanese director -- who achieved international renown 25 years ago with  "Woman in the Dunes" -- told the festival late last week that he no longer has  rights to "Rikyu," which tells the story of a legendary 16th-Century tea master  and his complex relationship with his warlord patron.  </P> <P> But the arts festival is now "trying to work out a deal with the New York  distribution company holding the rights -- it's not a dead issue," the  spokesman said. Even if the film is screened as scheduled, however, the  director said that he will not be attending the festival because of other  commitments. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

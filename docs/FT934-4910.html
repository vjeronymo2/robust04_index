			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / EU's laws on wildlife 'are safe' Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the former European Union environment commissioner, said yesterday he had won assurances from the European Commission that legislation to protect wildlife would not be sacrificed in the review of Euro-directives to weed out those that do not meet subsidiarity criteria. Mr Ripa di Meana, who left Brussels last year to become Italian environment minister, before resigning and becoming a leader of the Greens in Italy, said he had returned to Brussels to 'sound the alarm' against any roll-back of environmental legislation. Wildlife organisations claim that leaks to the European Parliament of draft Commission proposals show that Brussels is willing to yield on parts of legislation protecting seals, whales, elephants and species of wild birds. Mr Ripa di Meana said these were precisely the kinds of measures that 'triggered sympathy, consensus and identification with Europe' among its citizens by 'stressing what Europeans have in common rather than what divides them'.</p>

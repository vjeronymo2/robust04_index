			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / International Company News: Japanese developer files for protection Sanwa Tatemono, a Japanese property developer, has filed for court protection under the bankruptcy law with debts totalling Y124.3bn (Dollars 1.14bn), the largest financial failure in three months. The decision by the company, which does not have a stock exchange listing, will be a serious blow to its creditor banks, including Nippon Trust Bank (NTB), Mitsui Trust and Banking, and Sakura Bank. According to Teikoku Data Bank, the private credit research agency, NTB, the company's largest investor, has over Y30bn in loans and loan guarantees. The bank expects to write off the bulk of its loans to Sanwa, which is unrelated to Sanwa Bank, and intends to avoid falling into the red by covering the losses incurred with proceeds from stock sales. However, analysts fear such sales will depress NTB's unrealised gains on its stock portfolio, which totalled Y65.4bn at the end of September last year. Sanwa invested heavily in office buildings, golf course developments and resort development projects in Perth, Australia during the late 1980s. However, the plunge in asset prices and the subsequent economic downfall hurt demand, leaving the company with mounting debts. Hakuhodo, Japan's second-largest advertising agency, reports non-consolidated pre-tax profits for the year ended November, its first profit in four years. The company posted a 10.8 per cent pre-tax profit rise, to Y4.72bn, in spite of a 5.8 per cent fall in sales, to Y526.3bn. It was the third consecutive yearly fall in sales, and was blamed on cuts in advertising costs at Japanese corporations. After-tax profit fell 55 per cent to Y207bn due to special losses stemming from an increase in pension payment reserves. For the current year to November, the company expects pre-tax profits to halve to Y2.48bn, on unchanged sales.</p>

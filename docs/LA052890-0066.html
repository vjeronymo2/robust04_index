			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL ST. UNFAZED BY LATEST TOBACCO FLAP  </P> <P> Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. reacted quickly last week to news that two  universities were dumping their tobacco investments and the nation's top health  official was declaring war on cigarette vending machines.  </P> <P> The investment firm issued an enthusiastic "buy" recommendation for tobacco  shares.  </P> <P> "This publicity only hurts the stocks temporarily, and it has very little  effect on earnings or sales," said Roy D. Burry, tobacco analyst for Kidder, in  a comment echoed by other Wall Street stock pickers. "So it offers investors a  real chance to increase returns."  </P> <P> But if many on Wall Street played down the damage and talked up the industry's  impressive earnings growth, anti-smoking partisans predicted that the news  would contribute to the troubled image that has made tobacco stocks cheap for  some time. They say the movement will ultimately take its toll on the industry.  </P> <P> "Money managers are going to wonder before they buy a tobacco stock, 'Is this  going to some day embarrass my client?' " predicted Rick Krevor, executive  director of the Tobacco Divestment Project, in Boston. "And the companies are  going to face increasing economic isolation."  </P> <P> Tobacco stocks stumbled when Harvard University and City University of New York  said last Wednesday that they would sell all tobacco stocks amid predictions  that other institutions may come under increased pressure to do the same. The  same day, Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services, let it be  known that he would ask states to ban cigarette vending machines to limit  tobacco sales to youth.  </P> <P> Philip Morris, the market leader, was off $1 a share to $44.125 on heavy volume  Thursday and fell $1.625 to $42.50 on Friday, again on heavy volume. Other  companies with tobacco interests, such as American Brands, UST and Loews, were  also off Thursday and Friday.  </P> <P> Wall Street analysts acknowledge that tobacco's image problems have been a drag  on tobacco shares for some time.  </P> <P> Although cigarettes are one of the world's most profitable commodities -- with  operating profit margins of nearly 40% in some cases -- even the best stocks  trade at only about 11 times annual earnings. That compares to about 13.5 times  earnings for all stocks in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index.  </P> <P> The discounted prices are due to tobacco's image problems, fears of litigation  over health claims and worries about the declining unit sales of cigarettes in  the United States.  </P> <P> Many analysts are skeptical that the threat of further divestments or  Sullivan's initiative will do much harm to the industry's financial condition.  </P> <P> "Most of the institutions that would be nervous about them have already dumped  them," said Allan Kaplan, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. "This is old news to  them."  </P> <P> But Krevor insisted that officials of many institutions aren't even aware that  their pension trustees hold the stocks in their portfolios. Even the American  Medical Assn. was unaware for many years that it held tobacco shares as  investments, he said.  </P> <P> Anti-smoking activists believe that not only universities but government  pension funds, hospitals, mutual insurance companies and other institutions  will be highly vulnerable to the kind of public pressure they can bring.  </P> <P> Kidder's Burry said he doubted that Sullivan's plea to the states would find a  receptive audience. Restaurants, hotels and other businesses profit handsomely  from vending machine sales, he said, and such a ban would also seriously harm  vending machine companies. "This could mean real economic damage," he said.  </P> <P> Even if a large number of states approved such a ban, it would do little damage  to tobacco company sales, analysts predicted, because only about 3% of  cigarette sales are through machines. (An estimated 16% of sales from vending  machines are to minors, said Kaplan.)  </P> <P> And if the machines were banned, a large portion of the sales would probably be  simply displaced to supermarkets and other stores, analysts said.  </P> <P> Last week's news was part of a spate of bad publicity for tobacco. Protests  from Sullivan and civil rights groups about RJR Nabisco's plans earlier this  year to target "Uptown" cigarettes to blacks forced the company to cancel the  brand. Then word leaked that RJR planned to market a "Dakota" cigarette to  young blue-collar women, again drawing complaints. RJR said the cigarettes were  not targeted exclusively to young women.  </P> <P> Yet analysts are hopeful. U.S. unit sales are falling, but price hikes have  kept U.S. revenue growth at about 8% a year, says Kaplan. Overseas, unit growth  is continuing, and U.S. tobacco companies are seizing market share.  </P> <P> Those trends mean higher earnings and stock prices for industry leaders. Philip  Morris, now increasing profits more than 20% a year, was the best-performing  stock of the 30 Dow Jones industrials in the 1980s. Its shares grew 825% in 10  years, versus 228% for the Dow index.  </P></p>

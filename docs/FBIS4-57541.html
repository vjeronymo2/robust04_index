			<p>BFN     [Text] Today, the Federal Supreme Court [STF] ruled that  any strike by public servants is illegal. The government has  already decided not to pay its employees for days not worked.  Strikes are provoking losses everywhere.    Losses have been reported in Santa Catarina State, where  ships loaded with cargo cannot load or unload due to a strike by  Federal Revenue Secretariat [SRF] inspectors, who are only  allowing the unloading of perishable or dangerous commodities,  such as explosives and fuels.    Nearly 300 trucks -- most of which are taking cargo to  Paraguay -- are standing in a long line outside the customs  office in Foz do Iguacu, Parana State. Clearance through  customs is slow owing to the sit-down strike observed by SRF  inspectors.    Some 13,000 tonnes of cargo is sitting in the Cumbica  international airport of Sao Paulo awaiting customs clearance.  A court order has ruled that the cargo must be released. The  striking workers are obeying the court order, but they are also  observing a sit-down strike, which means the cargo will be  delayed for at least another month.    In Brasilia, the SRF strike has also interrupted the  reception of tax statements on diskettes. Pensioners and  retired citizens are making unsuccessful trips to collect their  checks from social security offices. Even labor accident cases  are not being processed. In April alone, 30,000 checks were not  issued and beneficiaries failed to receive 160 billion real  cruzeiros.    The Federal Police strike completed two months today.  Strikers commemorated the occasion with a cake and with a  protest rally outside the Justice Ministry.    Returning from Rio de Janeiro, President Itamar Franco met  briefly with Justice Minister Alexandre Dupeyrat and the federal  administration and social security ministers at the Brasilia air  base to discuss the wave of strikes by public servants. It has  been decided that the government will not pay for days not  worked.    Late this afternoon the STF ruled that public servants  cannot  exercise the right of strike. Eight of the 11 justices ruled  that, although the Constitution guarantees the right of strike  to civilian public servants, the right cannot be exercised until  it is regulated by Congress. Hence, any strike by public  servants is illegal.</p>

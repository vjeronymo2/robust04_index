			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Pepsi wins injunction PepsiCo won an unusual court injunction in the US yesterday, preventing a former senior executive from divulging information about the company to its rival Quaker Oats. Mr William Redmond, a general manager of Pepsi's beverages division before he left in mid-November, has also been barred by the federal court from taking any part in decisions about the pricing, marketing and distribution of soft drinks at Quaker for the next six months. Pepsi said it held no evidence that Mr Redmond had divulged commercially sensitive information, but the company claimed that his having worked on PepsiCo's planning and strategy meant he was in possession of highly sensitive information.</p>

			<p>930205 FT  05 FEB 93 / Personal View: Family emergency at heart of the UN There is a crisis in the international system for responding to humanitarian emergencies. To put it bluntly, when famine strikes, when conflict creates catastrophe, when refugees flee in large numbers, the international community cannot cope. From the Iraqi Kurds, to the former Yugoslavia, to Somalia, humanitarian crises have provoked an important debate about the role and development of the United Nations. Yet that debate has covered every area except the one most relevant to humanitarian emergencies - the role of the UN's internal 'family' of technical agencies. All too often, the response of these agencies has been slow, bureaucratic and lacking in co-ordination. In the worst cases, they have been fatefully negligent. The recent history of the Horn of Africa provides several examples. When famine hit Ethiopia in 1984, for instance, there were hardly any contingency food stocks in place, because the UN agencies had ignored the previous year's warnings of impending shortage. In 1988, when refugees from Siad Barre's brutal bombing of northern Somalia arrived in Ethiopia, their presence went undisclosed by local UN officials. Many died before, in the wake of donor pressure, the UN began to give aid. Then, in 1991, the sight of the Iraqi Kurds perishing on mountain sides, and the delays and mistakes that characterised that relief operation, finally moved the UN and its member states to make cautious reforms. However, following the deaths of hundreds of thousands in the Somalian famine, these measures stand exposed as woefully ineffective. It is the UN agencies' inability to deliver that is at the heart of their failures, not a lack of resources. Unicef, the children's fund, has a Dollars 755m budget. UNHCR, which deals with refugees, had around Dollars 550m in 1990. UNDP, which has a brief of development but which often finds itself involved in emergency relief, had Dollars 1.4bn last year; and the World Food Programme (WFP) can dispose of the same amount in a two-year period. It is this scale of resources, coupled with their status in the international system, that makes the UN agencies the pivotal element in the response to emergencies. When an emergency hits a developing country, the first line of defence is that country's own skilled workers - its doctors, nurses, engineers and public administrators. But if the country or the affected region is already poor, they may be overwhelmed. International non-governmental organisations can play a part in 'supporting' them, but cannot step in to save whole countries or regions from disaster. In a large-scale emergency it is normal to look to the UN agencies for the requisite scale of relief supplies, logistical capacity and expertise. The member states of the UN have a right to ask whether they are getting value for the money. Save The Children, which was closely involved in the emergencies discussed above, believes that a thoroughgoing review of the functions of the UN technical agencies is urgently required. First, the mandates of these agencies should be re-examined. They were drafted, in many cases, more than 40 years ago, to cover the needs of the cold war era. They need updating both to incorporate increased understanding of the complex causes and dynamics of emergencies, and to cope with an era that, for many parts of the developing world, will bring insecurity, instability and dwindling resources. Second, co-ordination must be made paramount. The clutter of overlapping responsibilities within the UN system must be cleared away. A single agency should be given the clear lead role in emergencies, and the UN enabled to act as an effective umbrella for the efforts of all workers involved. Third, accountability must be introduced. All too often, failures are covered over, while those who voice criticism to try to improve things are disciplined or discarded. Fourth, none of the above measures will have an effect unless the practical performance of the agencies in emergencies can be improved and confidence restored to the donors. This means, for example, ensuring that important posts are filled with people of proper competence as leaders and managers. It also means allowing much more autonomy to the good and experienced staff on the ground. Finally, UN member states must recognise their own responsibility, not only to instigate reform, but to push it along through any obstacles, and to oversee the continuing performance of the technical agencies.

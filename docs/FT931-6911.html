			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Norway is encouraged by cuts in interest rates - But export markets hold the key On Monday the Bank of Norway cut its key overnight lending rate from 9.50 to 9.25 per cent, the third cut this month and the benchmark rate's lowest level since it was introduced in 1986. The All-Share index rose 5.17 to 406.92 on the day, just below a 1993 high of 407.38 achieved earlier this month. But it has been unable to retain its strength, although yesterday gained 1.25 to 401.74 on a stronger dollar. Lower interest rates are expected to be the driving force behind an advance in share prices later this year, but the potential upswing will be restricted by sluggish export markets in Europe and limited US economic recovery. Most analysts believe that further cuts in German interest rates will pave the way for even lower rates in Norway, and lead to further strength in the dollar, both beneficial for the country's export-based shares. However, Mr Tage Haug, an analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities, cautions that lower interest rates will not necessarily lead to Norway outperforming Europe, since Belgium, France and Spain are more interest-rate sensitive markets; he thinks that further reductions in German interest rates could inspire a five per cent increase in prices. Few analysts believe that Oslo will take off before real growth in international export markets can be achieved, and this is not widely expected to happen before 1994. While US recovery and a firmer dollar are positive news for Norway, recession in Europe and Japan make it too early to overweight a market in which most companies are raw materials producers. 'Lower interest rates provide a good, underlying basis for growth', says Ms Mary Berg, an analyst at James Capel, 'but international demand needs to pick up before a major upswing in Norway can be expected. Norwegian companies have been working very hard to reduce costs and restructure, but their Nordic competitors have benefited from higher gains from currency devaluations than that of the krone.' But equity investors need to be convinced that the market will not deteriorate as it did in 1992. Last year the All-share index hit a high of 464.24 on January 17; then, due to a spate of bad news in the autumn and turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, it plunged to a year's low of 300.04 on August 25. Investors may be encouraged by currency factors. Norway was forced to float the krone on December 10 and the currency has fallen by just three to four per cent against the Ecu since then; but the Oslo market's industry index - grouping export-based companies together with oil shares - reached a high of 728.74 on January 10 after a 1992 low of 532.43 last August 25, and has held most of that ground since then. Mr Klas Andersson, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, says that the effective devaluation has been smaller than previously envisaged, and will lead to smaller devaluation gains in terms of earnings. In fact, what the currency float did allow was significantly lower interest rates, and with short-term rates down to their lowest level in years, investor focus this month has shifted to long-bonds. The yield on the government's S-448 bond fell to 8.7 per cent from 9.3 per cent at the end of January, the lowest level in nearly 15 years. Goldman Sachs believes bond yields may come down to 8-8.5 per cent this year. Some analysts believe that the rally in the bond market will filter though to equities later this year. Several of Norway's blue-chip companies, including Norsk Hydro, Elkem and Bergesen, have warned shareholders not to expect substantial improvement this year and the question is whether domestic, and foreign investors will have the confidence to look at 1994.</p>

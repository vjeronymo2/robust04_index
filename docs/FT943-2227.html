			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Workers at Swan Hunter face cut in pensions Employees of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside shipbuilder, could lose up to 40 per cent of their pensions because of the expected closure of the company. Actuaries for the pension scheme, which has roughly Pounds 60m in assets, explained that although the scheme is technically solvent, it does not have enough money to guarantee that all members receive their full pensions. While the 500 or so scheme members who currently receive full pensions will continue to do so, about 1,600 former workers with deferred pensions could receive up to 40 per cent less than their promised benefits. This is because the cost of buying annuities from insurance companies to guarantee the benefits is higher than the amount which actuaries calculate will be needed to cover the costs of full benefits to all workers. While shortfalls in technically fully-funded schemes are not uncommon when companies are wound up, the size of the Swan Hunter scheme makes it unusual. Union officials yesterday expressed bitterness at the shortfall in pension assets, saying that new government standards on minimum solvency for pension schemes are proving worthless. They also blame the shortfall on a 'contributions holiday' during which Swan Hunter paid no pensions contributions for six years. This practice is common among companies which find their pension schemes are overfunded. One of the four union trustees of the fund, Mr Eddie Darke, said that members were upset at the prospect of losing significant pensions money because of the company's likely closure. 'It's a major blow. There should be some protection for pensions schemes when they get in this position,' he said. About half the surplus which existed when the scheme was created in 1987 was eroded during the contributions holiday, while the remainder went on improved pensions benefits. Workers contributed 6 per cent of their salaries to the scheme, above the national average. At the time the scheme was set up, actuaries calculated it had more assets than needed to pay liabilities. The prospects for Swan Hunter pensioners to receive their full benefits are receding. The receiver, Price Waterhouse, now describes prospects for the sale of the company as a 'going concern' as 'remote'. Trustees of the Swan Hunter pension fund met yesterday at the Wallsend shipyard and agreed to shift the remaining 50 per cent of assets still in equities into fixed interest securities to guard against possible further erosion of benefits.</p>

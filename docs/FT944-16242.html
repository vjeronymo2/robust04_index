			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Alarm at prospect of petrol price rise Industry and motoring groups last night expressed alarm at the prospect of of a 31p rise in the cost of a gallon of petrol which could result follow stringent anti-car measures in a Royal Commission report later this month. The Road Haulage Association said a near-Pounds 3 gallon of petrol, arising from the recommendations and tax rises already promised for the next Budget, would have a disastrous effect on industry and the economy. The RAC said that a rise would be futile because it would not help to push people on to public transport. An AA survey published yesterday showed that 55 per cent of motorists said they would be unlikely to support a party that doubled the prices of petrol over the next 10 years.</p>

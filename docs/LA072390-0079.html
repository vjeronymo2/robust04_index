			<p><P> July 23, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2 PLEAS FOR PICKWICK  </P> <P> I have watched, with sadness, the lack of interest by Pickwick owners and  managers in maintaining this world-known gathering place of some of the most  famous names in skating.  </P> <P> Instead of tearing it down, why not correct the problem? Bring in people who  know how to make this training center profitable and are willing to work at it.  </P> <P> Think about the hundreds of young people who will be deprived of their dreams.  </P> <P> Must our figure skaters, hockey players, speed skaters, ice dancers, pair  skaters, recreational skaters, show skaters, precision skaters and future  Olympians be penalized?  </P> <P> Is there anything more exciting than seeing "our kids" standing on the podium  under that fantastic American flag at the Olympics?  </P> <P> Please, don't close Pickwick!  </P> <P> MARY KRAVETTE  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

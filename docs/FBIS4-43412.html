			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara (AA) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ferhat  Ataman recalled that Mas'ud Barzani, leader of the Kurdish  Democratic Party [KDP], and Jalal Talabani, leader of the  Patriotic Union of Kurdistan [PUK], held a meeting in Silopi on  13 June at the initiative of Turkey, and added: It was stated  at this meeting that only the terror organization is benefiting  from the current atmosphere of instability in the region.    Speaking at his weekly news conference, Ataman said Turkey  found the opportunity to convey its views on Iraq to the parties  that met in Silopi. He added that at the meeting the two  parties also expressed their grief over the losses incurred as a  result of the clashes.    At the meeting, Ataman pointed out, it was also stressed  that  the clashes between the KDP and PUK pose a danger to the people  in the region. He continued:    We have drawn attention to the fact that the clashes between  the KDP and the PUK adversely affect aid activities in the  region.    Our policy on safeguarding Iraq's unity, territorial  integrity, and independence was once again stressed tothe  leaders. Within this framework, we once more stressed the  importance we attach to the current northern Iraqi local  administration's restraint from behavior that might shake the  trust of the Turkish public.    Pointing out that the meeting in Silopi was a significant  step toward solving the current problems through peaceful means,  Ataman expressed satisfaction with this development.    Recalling the Iranian-Syrian-Turkish tripartite and the  Turkish-U.S.-French-British quadripartite meetings held in  recent months, Ataman said that, as was stated in the  communiques issued at the end of these meeting, solutions to the  problems in northern Iraq and the normalization of the situation  in the region should be sought within the Iraqi framework. He  added:    We, therefore, believe it is beneficial to establish a  dialogue between northern Iraq and Baghdad. Our views on the  issue have been conveyed to the leaders. We believe that both  the administration in northern Iraq and the one in Baghdad  should exert more efforts to overcome the current atmosphere of  mutual mistrust. We also believe that all countries in the world  should exert efforts in that direction.    In reply to a question on the elections in northern Iraq,  Ataman said the elections, which have lately been frequently  discussed by certain circles, should be assessed within the  framework of the importance Turkey attaches to Iraq's unity,  territorial integrity, and independence. Ataman concluded by  saying: We have conveyed to the parties concerned our view that  there is no reason to renew the elections.</p>

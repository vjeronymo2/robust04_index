China began to grant special government allowances to  outstanding experts in 1990. By the end of last year, nearly  110,000 experts had been granted allowances.    Compared to those selected before, there are more young  people among those selected this time, and many of them are  engaged closely in agriculture, industry and technological  popularization.    The officials said the allowance program helps encourage  hard  working people and thus intensifies people's respect for  knowledge and professionally capable personnel.    The state will continue to carry out the program with the  improvement of relevant regulations and concrete measures, the  officials said.</p>

			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADDING INSULT TO INJURY  </P> <P> I found a few interesting points in the story on John Mack. During his  sentencing, Mack was described as being under "intense psychological pressure  from 72-hour workweeks and a failing 3-week-old marriage." I also noticed that  currently Mack is "handling major responsibilities under considerable  pressure."  </P> <P> KEVIN STEINFELD  </P> <P> Seal Beach  </P></p>

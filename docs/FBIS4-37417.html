			<p>BFN     [Text] Mashhad, June 20, IRNA -- The toll of the dead has  risen to 70 and the injured to 114 in the aftermath of this  afternoon's bomb blast in the mausoleum of Imam Reza (a.s.)  [peace be upon him].    A caller to IRNA who called himself the spokesman for the  terrorist Mojahedeen Khalq Organization (MKO) said that MKO has  taken the full responsiblity for the blast. The caller said  that the bombing was meant to avenge the death of "martyrs of  June 20th uprising". He said that MKO was planning more acts of  subversion in "the following days." The caller then finished  his conversation, which lasted for 90 seconds, by yelling  obscenities at the officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran and  hung up.    On June 20, 1981 MKO operatives began their campaign of  terror against the then nascent Islamic Republic of Iran.</p>

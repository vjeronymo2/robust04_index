			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Tension rises when the chips are down: Louise Kehoe on increasing fears that world demand for semi-conductors is set to outstrip manufacturers' capacity A Dollars 150bn dollar question is hanging over the future of the world semiconductor industry. This is the amount that most industry executives say must be spent on new chip plants over the next five or six years if production is to keep pace with projected demand. But there are doubts that manufacturers will spend it. Chip makers worldwide are expected to spend a record Dollars 18bn on new plant and plant expansions this year. Even at this rate of capital investment, however, the industry is unlikely to achieve its end-of-century goal, prompting a top executive to predict a serious shortage of semiconductor chips. 'It is either a lack of resources or a lack of guts' that is holding back semiconductor industry capital investment, says Dr Gordon Moore, chairman and co-founder of Intel, the world's largest chip maker. Whatever the reason, he believes that 'investment is far from that required to sustain the growth in silicon processing'. The shortfall has potentially broad economic implications, far beyond the bounds of the chip industry. Sometimes described as the 'crude oil of the information age', semiconductor technology fuels the entire Dollars 700bn a year electronics sector, which includes computers, telecommunications and consumer electronics. A wide range of industries that rely upon electronics for factory automation or information processing could also feel the effects. 'Either the (semiconductor) industry growth will slow, or we are entering a period of high undercapacity. I see little evidence of the slowing of growth,' says Dr Moore. His 'Moore's Law', which describes the advance of chip technology in terms of a doubling of the number of transistors per silicon chip every 18 months, has held true for more than two decades. Indeed, world semiconductor sales have grown at an average 16 per cent a year over the past 20 years, despite cyclical peaks and troughs in the market. This year, worldwide merchant semiconductor sales (excluding chips produced by companies for their own use) are expected to top Dollars 100bn. By 1998, world chip sales are projected to reach Dollars 160bn and industry revenues are projected to be about Dollars 225bn by 2000, according to Integrated Circuit Engineering, a semiconductor market research group. What is harder to predict is where the greatest increases in demand for chips will be. Today the surge in personal computer sales is driving growth in the semiconductor industry, and most observers expect that PCs will continue to be the biggest market for chips for many years. But these tiny squares of silicon etched with microminiature electronic circuits are now ubiquitous, hidden within the works of everything from cars to communications satellites. Future products that might consume huge quantities of semiconductor devices include TV 'set top boxes' that link homes to information superhighways and pocket telephones, which are expected to be as common as blue jeans early next century. Even if forecasts for semiconductor demand are optimistic, chip makers will have to invest more heavily if they are to continue to produce ever more complex devices. Only the newest, state-of-the-art fabrication plants - 'fabs' in industry jargon - can produce the latest generations of microprocessors and memory chips. Already, there is a shortage of 'advanced' chip production capacity, says Mr Dan Hutcheson, president of VLSI Research, a semiconductor industry consulting group whose clients include the Clinton administration. 'And there will continue to be a shortage of capacity for the foreseeable future,' he says. Obsolete plant is not being replaced or upgraded sufficiently quickly, says Mr Hutcheson. It will take 50 years to replace all of the 'fabs' needed for production at current capital spending rates, he predicts. The biggest problem facing the chip industry is the rapidly rising cost of new plant, as equipment becomes more sophisticated to meet ever more exacting specifications. Since the mid-1970s the cost of building a state of the art, economically viable new chip 'fab' has risen from about Dollars 20m to as much as Dollars 1bn. And the cost continues to climb 'almost exponentially', says Dr Moore. 'We are well on our way to Dollars 2bn semiconductor plants.' Intel estimates it will spend about Dollars 5bn to produce its latest Pentium microprocessors, the brains of powerful PCs, in peak volumes. This is five times the cost of peak production of the current generation of 486 microprocessors. Mitsubishi, a Japanese chip maker, says it will need a Dollars 15bn investment in order to be able to produce one gigabit memory chips (devices that can store 1,000m bits of information) around 2000. Despite the rising cost of chip production, however, the industry's rate of capital spending has remained fairly constant over the past 10 years at about 20 per cent of revenues. As costs rise, the number of companies that can afford to participate in the semiconductor industry is dwindling, so limiting the industry's sources of investment. Only a few 'big spenders' remain. These include Intel, planning capital expenditure this year of Dollars 2.4bn, and Motorola, the second largest US chip maker, with a Dollars 1.7bn capital budget. Korean and Taiwanese semiconductor producers are also rapidly expanding production, with Samsung, the Korean producer, setting the pace with planned investments this year of about Dollars 1.1bn. Lagging the rest of the industry are most Japanese chip makers. After leading the world in semiconductor capital spending throughout the 1980s, the Japanese industry halted most of fresh capital investment in 1992 when its domestic economy went into recession. 'For years, Japanese conglomerates could afford to allow their semiconductor divisions to spend freely on capital additions, even through downturns in the semiconductor market,' says Bill McClean of Integrated Circuit Engineering. Since 1992, however, the non-semiconductor operations of the Japanese conglomerates have performed poorly, drying up the source of capital for their semiconductor operations. Japanese companies are starting to invest again, and are expected to spend about Y655bn (Dollars 6.5bn) this year on new plant for chip manufacture, up 17 per cent on last year but still 24 per cent below 1991 investment levels. In an ironic reversal of fears in the mid-1980s that Japanese companies would dominate the semiconductor market, US chip makers now worry that some Japanese companies will scale back their involvement, creating a void that may be hard to fill. For those companies staying in the market, particularly the few that can afford to build Dollars 1bn plants at the rate of about one each year, the semiconductor business is becoming increasingly profitable. Intel recorded pre-tax profits of almost Dollars 2bn, or 36 per cent of revenues, for the first half of this year, an industry record. Korea's memory chip makers are also reaping the rewards of their heavy investments in manufacturing capacity, says Mr Hutcheson, with profit margins on Dynamic Random Access Memory chips topping 30 per cent. Dr Moore looks forward to the day when the price of Intel's chips will reflect their performance and be 'based on the value of the product, rather than its manufacturing costs'. While price based on product value may not be unusual in other industries, it is a radical departure from trends in the semiconductor business. For as long as anyone can remember, the 'price per bit' - a measure of the cost of the computing power or storage capacity of a semiconductor chip - has been declining. Today, the price of a 4 megabit memory chip is about the same as the 1989 price of a 1 megabit memory chip. In other words, the price per bit is a quarter of what it was five years ago. If this trend were to be reversed, it could lead to some big changes in the computer industry. No longer, for example, would the average selling price of PCs decline while computing power increased. 'By about 2003 or 2004 we are going to see the real cost of computing power turn upwards,' Mr Hutcheson predicts. 'We are going to see a massive increase in chip prices.' In an industry where one year forecasts are suspect, predictions beyond 2000 must be regarded as speculative. Nonetheless, it appears that unless there is a significant increase in capital investment in the semiconductor industry over the next few years, the era of ever cheaper chips may be drawing to a close.</p>

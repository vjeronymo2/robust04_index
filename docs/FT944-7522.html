			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Cheers for a tight quango Sir, Re your article, 'Labour attacks ministers over spending on wine' (November 21), is Mr Alan Milburn, the Labour MP, a teetotaller? I am sure the Labour party serves wine at its official gatherings and I would have thought Sir Ewen Fergusson, head of the government hospitality fund advisory committee for the purchase of wine, should be congratulated for providing wine at an average of Pounds 5.26 a bottle. He also seems to run a tight quango if it only costs Pounds 1,500 a year to run. T W R White, 48 Somerset Way, Richings Park, Iver, Bucks SL0 9AF</p>

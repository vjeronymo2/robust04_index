			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Branson to inject fizz into his product range: Why Virgin's tactics would seem more familiar in Japan What has a cola drink to do with an airline, radio station, music store or computer game, and what have any of these activities to do with each other? Virgin's move into soft drinks, announced yesterday , looks distinctly out of step with the management vogue for paring down activities. But the company would argue that it is the Virgin 'attribute-based' rather than 'product-based' brand name which holds all these diverse activities together. The Virgin name does not mean a specific product to the public, but is associated with fun, friendliness, doing things differently, quality and price competitiveness, said Mr Will Whitehorn, Virgin's corporate affairs director. These attributes mean the brand can be applied to a diverse range of products, he added. These claims for the attributes of the Virgin name were given some independent credence recently by an NOP poll conducted for the trade journal PR Week. In two separate surveys it found that about 80 per cent of respondents associated the Virgin name with friendliness, nearly the same proportion with high quality, and between 60 per cent and 70 per cent with innovation, fun and low prices. Virgin's tactics may seem odd by the management standards of western businesses but would be familiar to the Japanese, said Mr Whitehorn. He points to the keiretsu, or corporate family formation, of Japanese businesses. 'Western companies tend to work in pyramidal structures, dominated by a holding company at the top. The keiretsu structure is flat and dominated by attribute-based brands. There is some communality of ownership but freedom among each of the units to make its own joint venture deals,' he said. An example is Mitsubishi, which is a bank and a car, as well as a shipbuilding and electronics company. All are part of the same family or keiretsu interest. Virgin's aim is to ensure that all its products and services match and exploit the brand attributes and are, broadly speaking, in the leisure area. Its computer games company has given the brand a presence in the youth market. Its link-up with ICL, announced last month, will mean the production of Virgin computers slanted towards and games and multimedia markets. The vodka tie-up with William Grant, also announced last month, fits the objectives for the Virgin brand, as does yesterday's cola announcement. Mr Whitehorn dismisses suggestions that the Virgin name could be weakened by diversifying into so many different areas. 'We've never really used the brand on consumer products until now. You can buy very few products, considering the number of trading activities we're involved in. What we haven't worked out yet is where to draw the line. We're taking it on a case-by-case basis,' he said. But is Virgin using the wrong name and should it re-brand itself as Branson? The PR Week survey suggests this might not be as ridiculous as it sounds. While 93 per cent of respondents recognised the name Virgin, 97 per cent knew the name of Branson, and 34 per cent said they would be more likely to buy a Virgin product or service because of their high opinion of Branson. A recent MORI poll for the BBC rated him as one of the figures - along with Mother Teresa - that young people would most trust to revise the Ten Commandments. Mr Whitehorn believes that the identification of Mr Branson with Virgin is particularly strong in the British public's mind, but this is not the case in Japan, the US or elsewhere in Europe. 'Richard has been very important to the brand name and has helped to establish its key values. But the strength of the brand transcends his involvement, especially overseas.'</p>

Nikolayev, Main Geophysical </F> Observatory; UDC 551.509:318:504.3.054]    [Abstract] The results of a statistical analysis of air  pollution in individual cities and in a number of regions are  presented. A special classification of synoptic situations was  made based on observational data for more than 30 cities. It was  found that there is a significant correlation between urban air  pollution and some synoptic situations. Situations characterized  by positioning of an anticyclone, ridge, trough and also the  western periphery of an anticyclone over the investigated region  favor the formation of regions of high air pollution. This is  manifested particularly clearly relative to the stable ridge of  the Siberian High, with which cases of low air pollution are  never observed. The formation of regions with a low pollution  level is associated with cyclonic situations, particularly with  the rear of a cyclone and its cold northern periphery. A high  pollution level is observed in regions of a warm front, and also  in the warm sector of a cyclone. A cyclonic circulation  accompanied by a front is observed twice as frequently in the  case of high air pollution as in the case of low air pollution,  and this despite the fact that in given situations factors (such  as a strong wind and precipitation) may be operative which favor  air purification. On this basis methods are proposed for  predicting air pollution in cities and regions for a period from  one to several days. Figure 1; references 20: 14 Russian, 6  Western.</p>

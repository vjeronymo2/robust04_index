			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> The Times reported Friday that Columbia Savings &amp; Loan executive Abraham  Spiegel was among several influential business leaders who played a pivotal  role in 1985 in "persuading" Mayor Tom Bradley to reverse his opposition to  Occidental Petroleum's proposed oil-drilling off Pacific Palisades. The  assertion oversimplified material in a previous article in The Times, in which  Spiegel was identified as one of several business leaders who supported the  Occidental position. Friday's article was not meant to imply that Spiegel spoke  directly to the mayor on the issue. The mayor said Friday that he made an  independent judgment on the Occidental plan, and did not discuss it with  Spiegel or any other business leader.  </P></p>

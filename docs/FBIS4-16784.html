			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by ITAR-TASS correspondent Natalya Cherepanova] </F>   [Text] St. Petersburg April 19 TASS -- Russia is  developing, in cooperation with the European Bank of  Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), a federal programme on  the development of small and medium towns. The Investment Bank  of Reconstruction and Development of Small Russian Cities will  be instituted for this purpose, Yevgeniy Malkov, the president  of Russian Small Towns Union, told journalists on Tuesday at the  presentation of the EBRD investment programmes in Russia.    The bulk of the investment projects are to be realized in  St.  Petersburg, Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, but a considerable part  of the Russian industries is situated in small towns. This is  why Russia will come to a market economy only if it modernizes  industry and transport in its small towns.    One of these programmes deals with reconstructing small  ports  on the Baltic, Black and Azov seas. Another one envisages  reconstructing local airports and industrial facilities.    According to Uralvneshtorgbank official Sergey Obraz, "the  Urals is a territory safe for investments because, no ethnic  conflicts take place here, and local industry managed to  preserve its high standards of research and development.  Scientists and engineers working on defence enterprises (the  Sverdlovsk region alone has five top-secret nuclear-technology  towns) can produce new technologies, but cannot make money.  This is why investment projects here should be launched before  they give up their production capacities completely."</p>

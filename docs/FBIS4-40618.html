			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Maria Bogdanova report: "The Paper Wants To Criticize the </F> Authorities at the Expense of Subsidies"]    [Text] The Communist Party faction in the State Duma  yesterday tried to wreck the work of the lower chamber by  declining to vote on the agenda. The cause for this political  demarche was the refusal by the Pressa publishers to print  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA, whose chief editor Valeriy Chikin is himself  a deputy. As KOMMERSANT-DAILY found out, yesterday's issue of  SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA did not see the light for economic, not  political, reasons. Pressa Deputy Director Mikhail Trushin said  that SOVETSKAYA ROSSIYA had loaned newsprint from the publishing  house and now owes it for 345 tonnes. Furthermore, the paper is  not paying for printing services: Since the beginning of the  year its debt has approximated 84 million rubles. SOVETSKAYA  ROSSIYA does not disclaim its debts and therefore, according to  editor Vladimir Polyakov, is trying to obtain subsidies through  the State Duma in order to continue the paper's publication.</p>

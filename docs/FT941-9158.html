			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Latin American debt servicing Sir, In summarising the conclusions of a recent J P Morgan economic research report on Latin American debt, the Financial Times headline said 'New debt crisis may hit Latin America' (February 15). In fact, the Morgan report did not suggest that a debt crisis might reoccur, and pointed out that debt-servicing capacities of the major Latin American economies have improved substantially since the early 1980s.

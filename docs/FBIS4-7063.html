			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Excerpts" of interview with Lieutenant General Arturo </F> Enrile, newly appointed chief of staff of the Armed Forces of  the Philippines [AFP], by Frank Longid Jr. under the rubric  "Face to Face"; date and place not given; "We Need A Credible  Military Force"]    [Text] You have said you will continue efforts to  modernize the AFP (Armed Forces of the Philippines]. But the  bill is still pending in Congress.    Well, what is important here is there is some kind of  persistence on our part that we should have a decent Armed  Forces in terms of equippage. And what we are really asking for  is not really, in the true sense of the word, modernization. We  are only pushing for what is really the basic equippage that our  Armed Forces should have to make it a credible military force.    An air force, for example, cannot be called an  honest-to-goodness air force if it does not have any jet fighter  interceptors or if it does not have any radar. What we are  asking for is very basic.    In other words when we talk about modernization we are not  talking about high-tech, state-of-the-art equipment, we are only  talking of the basic equipment we need in the Armed Forces to at  least make it a decent Armed Forces.    Sa Navy [in the Navy], for example, how can you say that we  have an effective Navy when we don't even have sufficient fast  patrol craft that can intimidate fishermen from other countries  poaching in our waters?    While the AFP is waiting for the modernization bill to  be passed, what do you intend to do?    We just have to make the most of what we have. We have to be  able to maintain the assets we have, although maintaining aging  equipment is also not economical. We are maintaining for  example ships that are older than the captains of the ship.  It's really difficult. Pag tumatanda and [If the equipment is  antiquated] the more you spend on maintenance until it becomes  more economical to buy a new one already. I think we have gone  way past that. Manila and Seoul worked out an  arrangement last year which allowed the South Korean government  to donate 12 boats to the Navy. Are there any other such  projects being planned?    We are looking at this. Of course the Koreans, as a matter  of fact some of their vessels have been given to us already. We  are looking at items for the Air Force also. I'm sure we will  not be capable of buying F-16's or things like that. But if we  can get geared-up F5's, which will serve the purpose in the  interim, maybe for the next 10 years.    What about American excess defense articles (EDAs)?  We are looking into that possibilities but we also have to  look into the aspect of how sufficiently we will be able to  maintain this equipment?    You talk of EDAs, but there may be no accompanying spare  parts. Baka [maybe] after a few months or a year we will be  needing spare parts and we will not know where to get them  because probably the company that produced these EDAs does not  exist anymore or manufacture the parts that we need so balik na  naman tayo sa [so we are back to] scrounging.    Just like Air Force items na [that are] EDA, they would like  to give it to us. Wala namang spare parts [Whereas there are no  spare parts]. That's a problem. We will study that very well  in the sense that when we accept, these are items that we should  be able to maintain and sustain.    What is the thrust of the AFP's modernization?    The thrust shall be the Navy and Air Force.    But critics say your Army background might get in the  way.    In my first conference with the senior staff and commanders,  in the presence of everybody, I said the first priority for  modernization is the Air Force and Navy. Pasensya muna ang Army  [The Army has to wait]. That's exactly what I said, even when I  was commanding general of the Army. I had accepted that: that  we have to play second fiddle to the Air Force and Navy.    Because as it is, we are proud of the Army already. Ang army  naman, halimbawa, makadating sila diyan sa ground, mga  adventurers na yan, [The Army, for example, can go to their  ground on foot, they are adventurers already] we will give them  hell. We have the best soldiers in terms of experience. Of  course, certainly, we also would like to upgrade some of the  Army's equipment.    Engineering equipment and some upgrading. For example, our  artillery pieces. Mayroon kaming [We have] 105's howitzers that  can shoot at a distance of 10-11 kilometers. If we can upgrade  this same gun, we can increase its range to 18-20 kilometers  sana [hopefully], which is now being done in other countries.  We should be able to do that.    Then the army will probably need medyo bago na sasakyan na  rin [rather new vehicles] to be used as cargo vehicles for  transport of troops and even for use during disasters and  calamities.    In other words, whatever we get will as much as possible be  tied up with national concerns. Yung equipment na kunin namin  [The equipment we will procure] will at the same time be made  available in case the national government will need them for  calamities, disasters, civic action, all of these.    What about the plans to streamline the AFP?    Oh yes, we will continue it, the streamlining. We have  nowhere to go. We have to streamline.    Defense Secretary De Villa said this may entail  reducing the AFP's strength by 35 percent over a period of 10  years.    That's possible. Wala pa tayong fixed figures diyan [We  don't have fixed figures yet], but one thing is definite: we  will reduce in strength, especially the Army.    Is AFP that confident its counterinsurgency efforts  will succeed?    Well not exactly that confident but I think the trends are  there, mukhang [looks like it is] irreversible. I'm not saying  100 percent... mukhang [just seemingly] irreversible.    The streamlining will affect thousands of soldiers.  How will the AFP prepare them for civilian life?    Yes, that's the thing that is really worrying us at the  moment. But we are lining up plans to make sure that once a  soldier is attrited he must have enough preparation to meet  other challenges other than being a soldier. But streamlining  will not happen immediately. Right now we will use the normal  attrition process.    It will be the Army which will have the most strength  reduction because when you talk of personnel strength, I think  the Navy and Air Force will not be touched so much. It will be  the Army that will be very much affected by the reduction in  warm-body strength.    Now we have, for example, on the average the Army attrites  about 200 men per month. This is in the form of retirement,  separation and death, etc. So you're talking of about 2,400 per  year.    Of course hindi naman puwede na [it is not possible that]  you  will stop recruiting. So maybe for every 2,000 that are  separated through normal attrition, probably we can bring in  300, 400 something like that. So in a span of just five years,  we are able to attrite 10,000.    What about the Civilian Armed Forces Units (Cafgus)?  How do you view the proposal to disband them?    We have no objection. But it should be done in a manner na  hindi naman biglaan [that is not be abrupt]. Hindi naman  puwedeng sabihin na bukas i-disband na natin ang Cafgus [We  can't say that tomorrow we will disband]. We have to phase it  in such a way that it will be in line or proportionate to the  improvement in the insurgency situation. Ibig sabihin [What I'm  saying is that], we are still pursuing our operational  activities... so we will need the Cafgus in many areas.    Will the Cafgus be disbanded by the year 2000?    Oh yes, probably even before that.    How much money will the AFP save when it  streamlines?    No, we are not talking about savings because as you  streamline it probably will be more expensive because you will  be spending more on equipment to make up for the loss in  personnel.    Sabihin mo magbawas ka ng [Say, you reduce] 10,000 troops,  that does not mean It will be a big savings. To make up for  that ano kailangan mo [what would you need]? You need equipment.    The AFP will be more efficient because we should be able to  use less people, but of course the effect of that also is we  will also be contributing to unemployment if we are not able to  prepare for civilian life those who will be taken out of the  service.    What about the planned reorganization of the AFP,  including tbe Kasama na yan [That is included].  It's an overall streamlining process. In other words lahat  yan [all of that] will be taken into consideration.    Do you accept the view that along with external  defense, AFP should Okay lang [That's okay].  The engineers, definitely can help. Even armored cars. If  there comes a time na kailangan [that we need] a lot of muscle  insofar as illegal logging operations are concerned we can use  the armored cars to patrol the forests. That will be tied up  with environmental protection. Even the Navy. You are talking  about protection of our seas, yung mga corals natin [the corals]  that are being raped. If you have sufficient fast patrol craft  na nakikita nilang nagpapatrol diyan, yung ating mga [that they  see patrolling in the area, the] illegal poachers will think  twice. The AFP is also helping in the improvement of the  economy. Actually, indirectly, the AFP is helping the economy.  Even without talking of engineering, even without talking of  direct involvement, indirect involvement of the AFP na lang  [just that], it is helping improve the economy.  Why is the economy improving? Huwag mo sabihin sa akin  hindi kasali ang AFP diyan [Don't tell me the AFP is not  involved in it]. How will you handle our relations with other  Asean countries? Yung [The] military exercises with Singapore,  tuloy pa ba yon [will it push through]?    Yes.    What about Indonesia?    Well, we are now in the process of working this out. This  should be a natural, shall we say, arrangement in terms of  exercises, bilateral muna [first]. Then maybe multilateral  later.    Also you have heard the president talking about, even in the  Spratlys, yung mga commanders doon e, mag-usap-usap [the  commanders there should be speaking to each other]. For example  if I'm a commander of the area that we claim, I go there, let's  say sa [to the] Vietnamese commander of the area that we claim,  I go there, let's say sa Vietnamese commander, ano [right], "o  [hey], I'll be going there, mag-picnic tayo diyan [let's picnic  there], or something like that. This is more of friendly  gestures ba [isn't it]. That the area is not really, should not  really be an area of conflict but it should be an area to  promote understanding and cooperation for the interest of the  nations with conflicting claims.    How do you propose to further improve military ties  with other Asean countries?    It has improved a lot. Unang una [First of all], maybe about  three years ago, it was not the same. Right now, ako lang [just  me], personally, my counterparts in the army of these other  nations, are all now chiefs of staff also, one is even minister  of defense. I have met them, we have established very good  cooperative and friendly relations with them, they have visited  us here, I have visited them.    Alam mo [You know], military to military, wala kang problema  [you don't have any problem]. Kasi ang culture ng military all  over the world isa lang [Because military culture all over the  world is one]. Very easy to establish friendships. Kasi walang  [Because there are no] political undertones, or political  implications.    Back to the insurgency, has strategic victory been  achieved? What do you think? Alam mo it's very difficult for  us to say this. Ikaw [You] what do you think? Have you seen  any insurgent activities? Totoo ba yung nasa NSC (National  Security Council) briefing na 2.6 percent barangay na lang ang  hawak nila [Is it true that in the NSC briefing, the insurgents  exert influence only in 2.6 percent of the country's  villages]?    Oo [Yes]. You interpret it already. Kasi kami pagsinabi  namin yan kayo na ang mag-ano niyan [Because if we say so, it is  up to you to consider]. Baka mas magaling pa kayo mag-interpret  ng data [You must be better in terms of interpreting data].    Matutuloy ang [Are you pushing through the] turnover of  counterinsurgency duties to the Philippine National Police  (PNP)by the end of this year?    Unless there are amendments to the law.    The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabansa [RAM --  Nationalist Revolutionary Alliance] claims its people are being  deliberately targeted for attrition from the AFP.    That's not true. I wouldn't say that because they were under  my custody when I was Army commander.    They seem to have greeted your appointment with  relative enthusiasm. .    I'm glad, I'm complimented by that.    Does this mean you will participate in the peace  process more actively, even only in confidence building  efforts?    I have been doing that, even before.    How?    I have been showing a lot of sincerity, even at the time  when  many of them were detained, they were not treated like  prisoners, and I helped them. From family problems to bigger  problems, open tayo diyan [I'm amenable to that]. This was a  period when most of them realized this is part of the game,  nadedetain sila, pero hindi dahil na-detain sila pababayaan  natin [they are detained, but because they are detained, doesn't  mean that they should be ignored]. So when they had problems,  we took care of them, that's part of confidence building. But  of course this is not for me to become popular with these  people. I will help them for as long it will not go beyond  policies, regulations.    Will AFP continue its support to PNP [Philippine  National Police] in its anti-criminality drive?    We are providing full support. As chief of staff now, I am  committing the resources of the AFP on whatever the PACC  [Presidential Anti-Crime Commission] will need without  necessarily being seen as being the major (player). Ano lang  tayo [We are just their], support. Our role is we should be  able to help all the agencies of government that need our help.    Is the AFP's rapid deployment force, about one  battalion of crack troops, still under the AFP's Task Force  Hammerhead which is mandated to assist law enforcement  agencies?    Oo. Nag-usap nga kami ni vice president diyan, sabi ko [Yes.  The vice president and I have discussed this. I told him], if  Gen. Lisandro Abadia supported you so much, I will support you  with more.    The AFP seems to be adopting a "low profile  policy."    Good. That's the way it should be. Alam mo the less the AFP  is talked about, the better. So the less you get news from us  the better. The less I appear on TV, the less I am read about,  di-ba [right?], it is better.    What do you anticipate will offer you the greatest  difficulty as chief of staff?    I do not know yet. I hope I do not have the greatest  difficulty.    Back to modernization, do you really feel a substantial  upgrade in equippage is possible, given all the limitations?    Modernization will be one of my "flagship projects." By the  end of my term, I hope I will not be frustrated. Ang importante  diyan [What is important] is we are following a certain line, if  somehow we can improve the Armed Forces in terms of equippage, I  will be very happy. If we are able to improve some more the  attitudes of our people, better.    Because when you talk of modernization, you are not only  talking of equippage. You are talking of training, and the goal  of having every person in the armed forces, ang kanyang [his]  preoccupation is to strive for excellence. To be able to show  to the civilian community that we are not different. Though we  are soldiers, we are part of the country, part of the community.</p>

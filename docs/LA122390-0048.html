			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTMAS: I WON'T BE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS  </P> <P> For Travelers, there is inevitably a moment when the exhilaration of discovery  gives way to an acute sense of being a stranger in a very foreign place. As  soldiers, diplomats and foreign correspondents know, that sense of displacement  may be keenest at times of traditional togetherness and homecoming. Here,  current and former foreign correspondents share some of their most memorable  Christmases away from home.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VIETNAM, 1967  </P> <P> I planned to spend my third Christmas in Vietnam with American troops near the  Demilitarized Zone, expecting simply to share their C rations and stoicism.  </P> <P> On this reporting trip I wasn't looking for much in the way of holiday spirit:  Grunts weren't given to much sentiment in that very dangerous part of the  world. And the place I landed didn't appear to offer much. It had no name, just  a forward outpost called C-1, in the sandy terrain north of Leatherneck Square  -- hard by the minefields and foxholes of the DMZ.  </P> <P> Earlier in Con Thien -- the corner of Leatherneck Square and target for shells  from North Vietnam -- I heard that an overnight cease-fire might be honored,  and that South Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky would pay a visit.  </P> <P> The Marines, however, were skeptical. Sgt. Stephen Newcomb told me he was  planning to stay inside his bunker, ready to fire back if necessary. On his  sandbags was the sign: "Noel."  </P> <P> At C-1, as the tropic sun swiftly fell behind the jagged Annamite Range, stars  blossomed in a cool, black sky. In the unaccustomed quiet, I could hear faint  sounds of surf from the South China Sea.  </P> <P> It was one of those moments when you realized just how lovely that battered and  forlorn country really was.  </P> <P> During the evening, Marshal Ky choppered in. He was joined by Vietnamese troops  and a busload of choir girls, in flowing ao dais, from the city of Hue. The  grunts had already downed their C's, but Ky's aides brought in beer and Scotch  to go with a Vietnamese banquet -- and invited everyone to dinner after Mass.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, soldiers had decorated surrounding barbed wire with colored bunting  and affixed paper stars to the tops of sandbagged bunkers. The mood at C-1 had  shifted from anxiety to gaiety.  </P> <P> Just before midnight, the strains of "Silent Night" issued from a tape  recorder, and a Vietnamese chaplain celebrated midnight Mass -- the responses  coming from the choir.  </P> <P> About 80 Vietnamese and 20 American soldiers knelt before the chaplain, Capt.  Nguyen Van Trinh, to receive Communion.  </P> <P> I've subsequently been to Midnight Mass at St. Peter's, but this was more  affecting: the mood warm and intimate, the lively scene illuminated by orange  flares launched by Marines in Dong Ha to the south, the cease-fire holding.  </P> <P> After Mass, a 23-year-old soldier-communicant named Robert Drewek -- with that  mixture of reverence and saltiness common to GIs -- told me: "This Mass sure as  hell made my Christmas. It was something special -- to think they could do it  way out here, near No Man's Land."  </P> <P> As the post-Mass celebration began and GIs broke into a chorus of "Jingle  Bells," Father Trinh looked reflectively around and said to me: "This is the  way it should be in my country. No guns. No shooting. No war."  </P> <P> Sadly, it would be a long time before the padre got his Christmas wish.

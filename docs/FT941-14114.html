			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Whinney Mackay-Lewis turns in reduced deficit Continuing losses were yesterday reported by Whinney Mackay-Lewis for the six months to end-October, although a 'significant improvement' is foreseen for the second half. Helped by a lower interest charge of Pounds 12,000 (Pounds 244,000), the USM-quoted architect and planner turned in a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 282,000 (Pounds 353,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.3m (Pounds 1.97m). Losses per share, however, widened from 3.7p to 4.3p. Mr Jeremy Mackay-Lewis, chairman, said the level of commissions and enquiries had continued to improve, and the order book had increased substantially in recent months. Nevertheless, it could be a while yet before a resumption of dividends could be considered, he added.</p>

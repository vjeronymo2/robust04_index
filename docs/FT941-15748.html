Directors Lord Rayne, chairman (above left), Mr John Conlan, chief executive (centre), and Mr Graham Coles, finance director (right), said yesterday that the group intended to build further health clubs over the next few years. Mr Conlan said he regarded health and fitness as a growing leisure market. First Leisure is paying Pounds 5.3m cash for the Berkshire complex, with a further payment of Pounds 1.9m due after completion of the audit of the club accounts for the year ending October 31 1994. The deferred payment is dependent on the club achieving growth of Pounds 300,000 in operating profit. The club earned pre-tax profit of Pounds 200,000 on turnover of Pounds 3.4m in the year ended October 31 1993. It has net bank borrowings of Pounds 3.9m and membership debentures totalling Pounds 1.5m. The club has 4,700 members.

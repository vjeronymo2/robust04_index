			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko, head of </F> administration of Maritime Kray and Federation Council deputy,  by Natalya Vstovskaya; place and date not given: "Yevgeniy  Nazdratenko: `For Me, the Kray Is a Big Economy'"]    [Text] His name flashed across the pages of the  kray's press, and soon, at the end of the 1980's, beyond its  boundaries as well. Starting from scratch, with 17 kindred  spirits, he established a mining company in Dalnegorsk--in a  city in the northern Maritime area. For a certain time the  enthusiasts worked at their business, specifically "their own,"  without losing courage, literally "working for nothing." They  did not divide the first profit of 25,000 among themselves and,  with patient agreement, the wives invested in the production.  After a certain number of such turnovers this was a unique  enterprise in which everything became beautiful a la Chekhov:  the work, the life of the worker, and the amazing harmony with  work-giving nature. In May 1993 Yevgeniy Ivanovich Nazdratenko  was entrusted to manage Maritime Kray. And in December 80  percent of Maritimers voted for him as a deputy of the  Federation Council.    [Nazdratenko] I could have improved things more in my mining  business. But concern for the future, at least for my children,  did not permit me to continue to live in an oasis, when there is  devastation all around. This is what led me to today's  post--anguish over how my countrymen are forced to live. And I  am confident that my team shares it completely.    [Vstovskaya] The inheritance that fell to your lot, Yevgeniy  Ivanovich, is not enviable. The time has come to shovel aside  the obstructions of the Maritime economy...    [Nazdratenko] Not even local obstructions, but the  consequences of the breakdown--the financial system of the  country and nonpayments. On one hand the kray has very rich  resource capabilities and very valuable experience in  interbranch cooperation, and on the other, there is a euphoria  of permissiveness and absence of control, pilfering of state  property, and a transfer of raw materials abroad.    Many know how at one time I fought for the idea of  joint-stock companies. I was one of the first to establish an  enterprise with a nonstate form of ownership, which the  communists did not like: At that time there was no talk yet  about conversion to joint-stock companies and privatization. But  now the democrats are accusing me of conservatism, calling me a  partocrat and an opponent of progress. But I am not against the  processes themselves, I am against the methodology of conducting  conversion to joint-stock companies. Who in the country needs  this conversion to joint-stock companies, when all of our  industry has "died." Who becomes the owner, and the owner of  what? The owner of the graveyard of industry, perhaps? Or is the  situation similar to that of the Bor association. If the  subscription for stocks brings with it a 30-40 percent reduction  in the number of workers, and the people under the conditions of  a single-industry village or a single-industry city cannot find  work anywhere, then, tell me, who needs such conversion to  joint-stock companies? Directors should not blindly carry out  directives from the top, but, with a sense responsibility for  the people in the creation of state programs, should proceed  from local conditions. If you cannot find an optimal solution  with the record and progress of production and the interests of  the people, then it is better that you leave and not taint  yourself with sin! Therefore, it is all the same to me what I  will be called--a democrat, a communist, or a Bolshevik--the  main thing is that I am confident that I am acting in the  interests of the people. Now the question has been raised: to  give complete authority to convert to joint-stock companies on  the territory, taking local conditions into account. It was  necessary to have three years of such savage and snarling  privatization to understand just what we have piled up. But now  they are letting the localities unravel it. Did I not say turn  to conversion to joint-stock companies, but in the direction of  the people?!    [Vstovskaya] Yevgeniy Ivanovich, at the same time, industry  has used up the energy requisitions. Nonetheless, it was  possible to live through the winter and not freeze, and not to  be in debt to the Federation.    [Nazdratenko] My team and I are frequently accused of going  to Moscow to scrounge for money. But we demand only that which  is our due. In what way, for example, is the single-industry  city Bolshoy Kamen, with its Zvezda plant that repairs  submarines, guilty? What--is it asking for subsidies? No--it has  a positive balance sheet. In what way is the aircraft-building  city of Arsenyev to blame? Is it asking for subsidies? It has a  positive balance sheet. How is the group of plants, including  Dalzavod, guilty? They fulfilled their duties to the government.  I am not asking for subsidies. I am asking them to pay for  produced products. Pay them! They will then receive their wages,  they will pay taxes, they will pay for electric power, we will  pay for fuel--to the krays and regions of Russia--and everything  will take its normal course. Therefore, when the state law on  bankruptcy is being prepared, it is not entirely understandable  to me in this situation. After all, the bankrupt is now the  state, which does not pay the plants, and they become bankrupt.  How can such a law be implemented? First pay, and then it will  be clear who is a bankrupt and who is not. It is necessary first  to become familiar with the credit-financial system in the  country.    Now, as for energy requisitions. If we use the terminology  of  Gaydar's doctrine--everyone under market conditions should have  equal conditions for getting started... Excuse me, what kind of  starting positions does the Maritime area have? When, for  example, the energy surplus in the chain of the Siberian GES  [Hydroelectric Power Station] puts the cost of a kilowatt-hour  at 9 rubles [R]. On Kamchatka it is R230, Sakhalin--R170,  Khabarovsk--R87, and Magadan--R90. In Maritime Kray it is R40,  the lowest of the Far East cities, but this is owing to the fact  that in August it was possible, together with the government, to  work out the wonderful Decree No. 1001 on stabilization of the  economy of the kray, which guaranteed Maritime Kray special help  from Russia, which is being implemented in the part of the  subsidy to the fuel-energy complex. After all, Maritime Kray is  the main eastern gateway and the transport back of Russia, and  carries a huge load.    The energy crisis of budget enterprises practically does not  affect defense industries. What difference does it make to a  defense enterprise how much a kilowatt-hour costs, it makes no  difference, it is paid for out of the state budget. But for the  rest of the enterprises--commercial, fish processing, mining,  lumber, and building branches--after all, these same figures  stifle every kind of production. I think that average tariffs  should be adopted for the entire territory of the Russian  Federation. Whether for the Kola Peninsula, where there is a  surplus of nuclear electric power stations, or Siberia, where  there is a chain of Siberian electric power stations, or for the  Maritime area, which has very little energy of its own  production.    We did not live this winter--we survived. I am so grateful  to  all the people for their patience! There truly was a frontline  situation. It was even necessary to evacuate whole villages in  some regions of Russia. Thank God it did not reach this point  here. The absolutely helpless people were covered in this  terrifying situation. Pensioners and invalids. In a word, it was  easy to control the money that was released for these purposes.    To resolve the question of energy supply for the Maritime  area, the Ussuriysk TETs [thermal electric power station] has to  be completed. But the question arises: How is it to be fed? It  will be necessary to develop new open-pit coal mines. And to  have our own coal, and not depend on the central part of the  country. For the reason that after tariffs on electrical energy,  the second hitch is railroad tariffs, which cut off the oxygen  for the railroaders themselves: 37 percent of the freight was  not shipped, and they remained out of work. But if we have our  own coal, which will not have to be conveyed from far off, the  cost of electric power will become cheaper, and the enterprises  will be able to take a deep breath of air. And we will solve the  problem for a minimum of 10 years. But this will require the  assistance of the Government of the Russian Federation.    The present railroad tariffs do not permit the kray to  either  import or export anything. When you pay R120 million for one  rail car from Vladivostok to Moscow, what can be carried in it?  It is unprofitable. Therefore, we are correct in already buying  grain abroad this year, and bringing it in by sea. And meat, and  macaroni products...    An edict of the president on support for Russian grain  producers was being prepared. This edict established huge duties  so that we would not import grain from abroad. In principle and  in logic--yes, all rural residents should welcome this. But in  the Maritime area, which is oriented on the defense industry,  and where the terrain is mountainous and not much grain is  grown, this is unacceptable. We talked about this in the  government. We had numerous proposals and were able to convince  the president and the government, and they passed a decree  according to which there is no duty on imported grain, and there  is a differentiated approach to other products. Consider--an  ocean liner takes 12 days from Canada and carries 10,000 tonnes  of wheat at one time, at an acceptable price. A tonne of  Canadian wheat costs us R100,000, while a tonne of Altay wheat  costs R270,000. Which is better?    Incidentally, the government treated us with complete  understanding, and exempted us from customs duties with respect  to grain. And we will without fail find how to support our own  grain producers and other agricultural products.    [Vstovskaya] The government also heard the appeals of the  administration regarding fair export quotas and duties for  enterprises that were glutted!    [Nazdratenko] I also consider this to be a victory of common  sense. Six enterprises of the mining industry of Maritime Kray  for whom duties were removed will be able to sell part of their  concentrate and its production abroad. The enterprises have once  again begun to work at full capacity, and people have gone back  to their jobs. Previously some of the most profitable  enterprises--Dalnepolymetall, Bor, and the well-known  Spassktsement, although it was idle all winter, are beginning to  work at full speed. And now orders have come in for cement.    Only Khrustalnenskiy GOK [mine processing combine] is not  part of such enterprises. Its position is more complicated,  inasmuch as the central mine there ran out, and it is being  closed down. But this combine makes up the town: It is the only  large employer in the village of Kavalerovo. Therefore we are  concerned for it and the whole village. We are now working on an  agreement with Kamchatka where there are a number of gold,  nickel, and sulfur deposits. Part of the resources will be moved  there, and work will be conducted on the watch method. This,  probably, is right.    [Vstovskaya] All this is extremely necessary and  appreciable,  but it is unskilled labor. Is it already possible to construct a  building on a level platform?    [Nazdratenko] We have already started to draft an important  decree, and we are coming to an agreement with the government on  a concept of the status of Maritime Kray and its development. I  think that this will be a working document, if the government  accepts it. It has gotten an "OK" from Viktor Chernomyrdin,  chairman of the Government-Council of Ministers. Only scientists  of the Far Eastern Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences  are involved. No one from abroad will be brought in--only with  our own mentality! Whatever we come up with is what we will live  with. There will be nobody to accuse of leading us down the  wrong path. Of course, the prologue was Decree No. 1001. A lot  of good things are outlined there. Our latest document that is  being prepared on the status of the kray in light of the new  constitution, according to which we all became components of the  Federation (that is, everyone worries about his own territory)  with a unified constitution and a unified political system, will  make it possible to take into account the economic interests of  the Maritime area as a part of Russia and the Far Eastern  Region. To determine in what directions and how its economy will  exist independently.    Part of this big concept for the development of the Maritime  area is the outlook of the kray under conditions of a transfer  to the market in light of the geostrategic and economic  interests of Russia is being developed on resources from the  budget of Russia.    [Vstovskaya] How do you see Maritime area relations with  other territories of the Far East?    [Nazdratenko] The problems of the Maritime area, Kamchatka,  Magadan, Sakhalin, and Khabarovsk could be resolved in one idea.  Apparently, the tsar who did not divide these krays and oblasts,  but simply named a governor-general, was not stupid. I think  that the time will come when we will have to unite. I, at least,  am taking big steps toward this. We must integrate; otherwise,  each will be selling its resources abroad for a song. I would  see such cooperation here. Although there are a lot of  differences internally as well.    In a word, I am an industrialist, and I treat our Maritime  area as one big economy. We lived through the winter. And  although it was very difficult (but, in addition, endless audits  and dirty tricks were distracting), I am not disappointed in the  work. And concern for the next winter is already pushing people  into action. Because we did not succeed in developing open-pit  mines, we did not succeed in developing coal supplies. We did  not succeed in completing the construction of the Ussuriysk  TETs. We need state money--there is none. There are many  problems. One thing is left: For us, Maritimers, to continue to  work, rolling up our sleeves, together with other Far  Easterners. To work in a good way with the government and to  resolve tasks that life presents us logically and not simply to  put forth slogans.</p>

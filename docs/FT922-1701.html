			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Arts: Exotic drama from Spain in Vienna - Jackie Wullschlager gets caught up in zarzuela, flamenco and peasant ritual THE HOLY Roman Emperor Charles V is supposed to have said'I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.' Polyglot sophistication was the triumph of this year's Vienna Festival, which between Carmen and The Barber of Seville presented a showcase of Spanish drama in English, French, German and even Romany. Among the most exotic theatre to tour Europe' s summer festivals - Avignon, Paris' 'Cycle hispanique', Seville - in the next months will be Spanish plays. The three I caught were eye-openers: idiosyncratic, highly-charged exports unlike anything else in the European repertory. Imagine HMS Pinafore playing in the Pyrennees and you get a sense of Spanish zarzuela tuning up in Vienna's stately but decaying Ronacher Theatre. Habaneras, fandangos, a parched courtyard, serenades up to wooden balconies, women rushing in with cakes balanced on their heads, men in straw hats singing hymns to an accordion; this is the local colour of Spain's folk opera-cum-musical theatre. The zarzuela, its golden age a century ago but its evergreens still as popular as contemporary hits, is Spain's equivalent of Viennese operetta or Gilbert and Sullivan. Like them, it tells much of national character, it is satirical and it depends on caricature and catchy numbers; unlike them, it concentrates on ordinary people, those who hang about village squares or courtyards, their lives a public entertainment. Alain Maratrat's Zarzuela] Historia de un patio, a French co-production between Vienna, Avignon and Peter Brook's Bouffes du Nord, is based on Tomas Breton's zarzuela about the festival of the patron of Paloma, La Verbena de la Paloma (1894). It opens in brilliant daylight, extras throwing water across the stage to cool the courtyard and the rising passions. Julian, the jealous lover, seeks his rival; Don Hilarion, the old apothecary in threepiece white suit, sungla sses and walking stick eyes the girls nostalgically; Mari-Pepa the coquette flutters her eyelids randomly from her window. Castanets, fans, bursts into dance and songs about Espana set the tone, but this is also any small town on a summer bank holiday, where lovers' tiffs and quests escalate into violence, harmless raconteurs are threatened with a gun because there's not enough to do. The celebrations twist suddenly into fear; the stage darkens, the courtyard becomes a mesh of nooks and doorways, Mari-Pepi's lover creeps out to declare himself, to be confronted by three others with the same idea. A fight turns as quickly into a joke, a clown with a pig-tail strums a lantern-lit love-song on a pianola. Musically, I found my first zarzuela an agreeable hotch-potch. Voices range from the full-bodied mournfully mellow Julian (tenor Rodolfo Acosta) to actors singing hits; solo instrumentalists are both competent and fine comedians, from acrobat-violinist Manuel Solans to the guy playing wine bottles like a xylophone. It's light-hearted summer fun, earthy, knowing, anarchic in its alliance with the underdog: women have power, men are romantic fools; a brass band shambles around the auditorium as a mocking march erupts at the verbena: 'le gouvernement parle/De la question sociale'. Spain's great modern dramatist Federico Garcia Lorca once wrote a poem about joining in the verbena to get close to folk gossip and the disorder of everyday life. To show Lorca's intense Blood Wedding just after Maratrat's Zarzuela] was a triumph for Vienna, an example of how at a festival illuminating contexts can enhance enjoyment of even very strong individual productions. Blood Wedding, Lorca's rural tragedy of lust and revenge, seems in Theatre Pralipe's Romany version a natural successor to the Spanish folk musical. Ritual courtship, jealousy, murder are played out on a public stage through mime, dance, music. Classic types - the Mother, the Bride - are pushed to enact 'honourable' roles that tear them apart within. The entire play is encompassed in an opening choreographed duel and love affair played to the Habanera from Carmen. There is a fight between cockerels on a barely lit platform. In a fevered ballet lovers swing towards each other and apart holding on to blood red sashes. A dance with forbiddden fruit has oranges meekly swapped by the married pair, gnawed to scraps by the lovers. An actor playing the Moon covers the rivals with a gold shroud before a forest of candles with a shrine of the cruxifixion. The seasons, the heat, inflammatory village talk, day turning to night; in all this the stage becomes a self-contained world rooted in peasant ritual. Yet Lorca was writing in the 1930s and grafted expressionist anguish on to popular Spanish lore. The success of director Rahim Burhan's iconography is to draw hallucinatory fear out of the sentimental, naive tale. In his poetry, Lorca saw gipsies as emblems of ordinary folk vulnerable to authority, to the Civil Guard with their 'souls of patent leather'. This is the second time I have seen this gypsy production; it is now exquisitely stylised yet still raw, fresh, and not to be missed as it winds across Europe. From Lorca to Hemingway: both obsessed by death, blood ritual, Andalusian landscapes and customs, but the one lyrical, the other macho in response. Hemingway would have loved Jan Lauwers' Needcompany's setting of his stories, Invictos, which opens with an enormous stuffed bull rotating centrestage and a burst of flamenco. Tough-talking guys in sharp suits and sunglasses cut and thrust at one another while touching up the beast; they smoke, drink whisky, direct one another across the stage, each to his place at the foot of a wooden panel with a porthole through which grins a large fish. You guessed it - they are actors and writers whose story of artistic failure is told through the metaphor of a shipwreck. Of course, as the title suggests, they are not conquered in the end, because their failure becomes an art - hence the play, which is riddled with such tail-chasing wisecracks. Deconstructionist twists, gallows humour, corpses dug up because bribes haven't been paid, intermingle with tourist numbers like 'Spain is a burning rose'. There are longueurs, but I was won over: by speed, slick timing, breathless improvisation of language - it plays in Spanish, German, Dutch or English according to venue - and text, which seems to adapt to participation even from babies in the audience. Zarzuela] Historia de un patio, sponsored by Rank Xerox, is at the Avignon Festival in July; another zarzuela, La Del Monojo de Rosas, is at the Theatre Europe, Paris, from June 23. Invictos is in Berlin (16-20 June), Amsterdam (27 June - 1 July), then Seville. Blood Wedding is also to tour Europe this summer.</p>

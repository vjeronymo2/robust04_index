The Ifo  Institute cites in particular Zhirinovskiy's success at the  parliamentary elections in December 1993 and his goal to replace  Boris Yeltsin as Russian president in 1996. The Russian reform  and stabilization program adopted in the autumn of 1993 also  contains problematic taxation plans.    In view of the massive tax evasion in Russia, it would be  desirable to go back to administratively simpler taxes which are  difficult to evade, the Ifo Institute writes. The institute  also proposes property taxation. The Russian budget deficit for  1993 will probably be 1.5 to 2 trillion rubles higher than  planned. At the end of 1993 the government also approved a cash  injection of 550 billion rubles for the arms industry and took  emergency measures to alleviate the energy crisis in the CIS  caused by the cold winter.</p>

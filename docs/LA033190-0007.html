			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STUDENT LIVES 3 MONTHS IN HIDEAWAY AT HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> An 18-year-old high school student lived for the past three months in a secret  apartment above his school's auditorium in Sun Valley, building a carpeted home  with a bed, TV, VCR, microwave oven and telephone, authorities said Friday.  </P> <P> Robert Davis used his talents as a stage-set designer for the drama class at  John H. Francis Polytechnic High School to create a refuge from his parents in  an attic area above the stage, Principal Virginia Holt said.  </P> <P> "Believe me, it was very, very surprising to all of us that a student could do  this. But if a student is creative and enterprising enough, he can do anything  he wants," Holt said.  </P> <P> Davis was arrested at the school Tuesday morning on suspicion of trespassing  after campus police discovered his hide-out when they apprehended three  companions the night before, Holt and police said. He is free on $2,500 bail,  Los Angeles Police Detective Oscar Caraballo said.  </P> <P> Holt, who gave reporters a tour of the garret Friday, said Davis took up  residence there during Christmas vacation, apparently because of trouble with  his parents.  </P> <P> "He had problems at home with his parents and needed a place to stay," the  principal said. She said Davis' parents did not contact school authorities  during their son's absence, but she declined to provide further details.  </P> <P> Davis and his parents could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> "He really had no place else to go," said Antonio Brown, 18, who said he was  one of six students who knew where Davis was living. "I knew about it for some  time but didn't say anything about it. I didn't want him to get into further  trouble."  </P> <P> Davis attended classes as usual while he lived above the stage, the principal  said, and managed to avoid detection because of "a very large, very active  school."  </P> <P> Holt said the three-year high school on Roscoe Boulevard has more than 2,300  students enrolled in day classes and about 1,200 in night school. "People are  here as of 6 a.m. and they're here until 11 p.m.," she said. "He may have been  seen as just anyone here."  </P> <P> The principal declined to discuss Davis' academic record in detail but said "he  was a rather creative kid" who was involved in the school drama club and  enrolled in a stage-crew class, in which he excelled at designing lighting,  sound, props and other technical systems.  </P> <P> Because of his involvement with the stage, Davis was entrusted with a key to  the auditorium, and he made at least two duplicates, Holt said.  </P> <P> The small, triangular room he occupied was among several crannies in an attic  space above the school stage. It is used to gain access to the auditorium's  loudspeakers, according to Holt and the school's plant manager, Eric Hillman.  </P> <P> Davis painted the speaker room's bare, concrete walls white and installed  wall-to-wall, khaki-colored carpeting. He built a loft space in which to sleep  and installed a mattress, couch and chair. He hooked up a telephone to the  school's system, Holt said.  </P> <P> The microwave, and some but not all of the other items Davis used, were taken  from the school, according to Holt, who said administrators and teachers  noticed the appliances were missing but were unable to determine where they had  gone.  </P> <P> A narrow, metal ladder offers the only entry to the room, so Davis must have  installed his furniture and appliances by hoisting them up on stage  scaffolding, Holt said.  </P> <P> Holt said Davis changed the lock on the speaker room's door, confusing school  custodians who tried to enter and then assumed that the school administration  was responsible for the change. According to the principal and police, a campus  supervisor noticed a youth trying to enter the building about 11 p.m. Monday,  became suspicious and alerted school police. Officers entered the auditorium  and found four students, including Davis. They arrested three, but Davis fled.  </P> <P> He turned himself in at the school the next morning and told authorities his  story, Holt said.  </P> <P> Holt said she had not decided whether to take administrative action against  Davis. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, which  will decide whether to file any criminal charges, said it had not yet received  Davis' case for review.  </P></p>

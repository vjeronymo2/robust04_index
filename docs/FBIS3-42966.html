			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Public opinion poll results: "RL [Republic of Latvia] </F> Government Ratings, No. 9"]    [Text] Commentary    In examining the results of the periodic poll, we see that  still there is no particular trend in public's opinion of the  governmentis apparent. Comparing these results with those of the  previous poll at the end of last year, the ratings of almost all  members of the government have increased slightly. We will soon  see whether this tendency shows durability. But this time let's  look at that area which under current circumstances essentially  influences both the public's opinion of the Cabinet of Ministers  and the success of the government's actions: the intersection of  foreign policy and domestic policy.    In the first two weeks of 1994 the most prominent event, Mr.  Rucs's action, and its repercussions were already widely known  and greatly discussed in the mass media, causing one to reflect  on a few other, less examined situations.    First of all, Mr. Rucs's operation obviously will provoke  certain background questions regarding resolution of the fate of  the Skrunda radar base. That could be exploited both as linkage,  and as the opposite, as a non-linkage argument in the expression  of public opinion in Latvia. In which direction this argument is  used will become apparent very soon in the government's  orientation of the information flow.    Secondly, a foundation was laid for a new polarization in  public opinion, which might possibly be maintained until the  local elections. Whether its heirs will be "an understanding,  moderate orientation" or "the active radical forces" is still  hard to predict. Much will depend on future propaganda  campaigns, of course, and also on political activists in Russia.    Thirdly, the government must react to the shortcomings made  obvious by the activities of the state's administrative  mechanism, which were revealed in the events in the Vidzeme  borough. Regardless of how we evaluate Mr. Rucs's actions, also  knowing that in the world these sorts of incidents are not rare  by any means, it is clear that even in a state with a  deliberately decentralized administrative structure, development  of such a situation is viewed as abnormal, both in the  legislative and executive structure activities aspects.    Fourthly, our country is threatened by routinization of  behavior inherited from the previous government, the  unsatisfactory tendency--a sufficiently significant process of  evaluation to concentrate attention on the actions of  individuals. And therefore the most essential is the question,  which has often been heard already, whether this noisy action  has hidden causes and, if so, then what? But are those who are  able to answer this question able and willing to do so?    The [Parex] expert group would be very thankful to  NEATKARIGA  CINA readers for their critical suggestions and proposals. Our  phone numbers are Riga 331663 and 334162.

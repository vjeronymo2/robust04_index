			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DPA) -- Radioactive material is being stored  at Bundeswehr facilities in Storkow near Berlin. In its  response to a request from the Party of Democratic  Socialism/Left Ticket, the Federal Press Office has stated that  this is confirmed by the Federal Government. The facilities  were taken over from the National People's Army of the GDR, and  most of the radioactive material has come from those stocks. "A  considerable part" of the material was also stored there by the  GDR Ministry for State Security. The material consists of  "sealed radioactive sources," mainly of the Cobalt 60  radionuclide. The Bundeswehr was looking for ways of using this  material, it was stated.</p>

			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / World Trade News: Handshake on Nafta could come today - Reports indicate core of North American trade accord has been agreed LEADERS of the US, Canada and Mexico are expected to announce today that they have reached agreement, after 14 months of negotiations, on an historic free-trade pact for North America. The office of Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, did not confirm the reports, but diplomatic sources said plans were under way for a ceremonial 'handshake' at the White House in the morning, to be followed by press conferences with the three trade ministers. The three have negotiated continuously for 10 days in the capital. They were still negotiating late yesterday, but reports indicated the core of the pact was agreed; what remained was largely the job of translating it into hundreds of pages of legal text. However, other sources close to the talks described the ceremonial arrangements as provisional. They said difficulties had arisen in the writing of summaries to be presented when the pact was announced, and unless agreement was reached the talks could continue for another day. Reports have been circulating in Washington that the Bush administration is anxious to conclude the treaty before the Republican convention in Houston next week, where the pact could be touted as an achievement by a visionary president. Mr Timothy Bennett, a trade consultant, said yesterday: 'Whether or not Mrs Hills has had a deadline, there is a perception on the part of her negotiating partners that the US is in a hurry.' The North American free-trade agreement is a ground-breaking pact - the first between a developing country and its industrialised neighbours and the first to address the environmental problems which accompany rapid industrial growth. It will create the world's most populous free-trade market - 360m consumers - with an output of Dollars 6,000bn (Pounds 3,100bn). Mr William Riley, administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency, said yesterday it would be 'the greenest international trade treaty the world has seen,' setting a model for trade pacts in the future. It would give states and local governments the right to prohibit entry of goods not meeting their own health standards, stress 'sustainable development,' prevent the lowering of environmental standards, and contain an ambitious plan to clean up waste dumped along the border by polluting companies. The pact would also roll back thousands of separate tariffs over the next 5 to 15 years, spur new capital investment in all three countries, and create new jobs. It could take weeks for the agreement to be sent to Congress for an official 90-day notification period. It will not be voted on until next year. By then there could be a new president and certainly a new Congress; with retirements and defeats the House could have 150 new members. Congress is not likely to vote down the pact but it could make problems by demanding changes in environmental sections and provision for labour adjustment.</p>

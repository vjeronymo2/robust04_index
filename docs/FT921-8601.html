			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Telecommunications busy in merger activity Telecommunications was a busy sector for international merger and acquisition activity last week, writes Brian Bollen. Telefonica de Espana's purchase of 80 per cent of Telefonica Larga Distancia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico-owned long distance carrier, consolidates its position in Latin America at a time of intensifying competitiion among global long distance carriers. The asset-pooling joint venture between Motorola of the US and Northern Telecom of Canada is aimed at stepping up competition in the cellular telephone sector. American Telephone and Telegraph said its joint venture with a St Petersburg-based company was only a small part of its plans to develop Russia's communications and improve the infrastructure there and eastern Europe. Northumbrian Water is continuing the trend for diversification by the UK's privatised water companies. It described its joint venture agreement with Spanish construction company Obrascon as a significant step forward for its activities in Spain, where it has been providing river cleaning expertise for several years. After a series of non-core disposals, Imperial Chemical Industries started buying again. Its bolt-on acquisition of Barnices Valentine, a Barcelona-based maker of vehicle repair paints, will fill a gap in its southern European markets. Also bolting on was Allied-Lyons, which acquired the Michigan-based Dawn Donuts chain.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CROSS BORDER M&amp;A DEALS  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR         TARGET            SECTOR      VALUE  COMMENT                                                      Pounds  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Motorola (US/Northern   Motorola-Nortel   Telecoms     110m Sector Telecom (Canada)        Communications                      competition                         (JV)                                hots up Telefonica de Espana    Telefonica Larga  Telecoms     79m  In search of (Spain)                 Distancia                           synergies                         (Puerto Rico) Cap Gemini Sogeti       Programator       Computer     48m  Agreed bid (France)                (Sweden)          services Alcoa (US)              Kofem (Hungary)   Aluminium    28m  Controlling                                           products          interest                                                             sought Babcock International   Consilium CMH    Materials    21.4m Long term (UK)                    (Sweden)         handling           growth move BTP (UK)                Lembiotte/TRL    Adhesives    8.8m  Completing                         (both France)                       European                                                             jigsaw Citizen Watch (Japan)    G Boley         Machine      4.5m  First                          (Germany)       tools              foreign                                                             acquisition Ash &amp; Lacy (UK)          Galvanisation   Galvanising   1.7m Third such                          de L'Artois                        buy                          (France) Northumbrian Water (UK)/ Obrascon        Water supply   n/a Seed corn Obrascon (Spain)         Northumbrian                       move                          (JV) Italcementi (Italy)      Cemos Ostrava   Cement        n/a  Italians                          (Czechoslovakia)                   cement                                                             position  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT Mergers + Acquisitions International  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

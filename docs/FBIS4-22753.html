Directive No. 31 of the minister of  justice of the Republic of Kazakhstan, which suspended the  operation and revoked the registration of all Russian  communities in that country, was the reason for the above. This  caused an extremely negative reaction in Omsk and spawned a new  surge of territorial claims against Kazakhstan. In particular,  the article of S. Suprunyuk, chairman of the Duma of the North  Kazakhstan Oblast Russian Community entitled "...And Then the  Nation Loses" (OMSKOE VREMYA, No. 3, 1994) plays on the  historical fact that until 1921, Petropavlovsk was an uyezd seat  within Omsk Gubernia, and that until 1936 all of Northern  Kazakhstan was a part of the RSFSR with an autonomous status.  However, specific facts cited in the newspaper--the breaking up  of the republic-wide conference of the Slavic cultural society  Lad in Pavlodar and the Cossack circle in Petropavlovsk by the  authorities of Kazakhstan, as well as judicial prosecution and  the ban on the Russian-language newspapers ZNAMYA SVOBODY, GLAS,  and VOZNESENSKIY PROSPEKT in North Kazakhstan Oblast--testify to  infringements of the rights of the Russian population in  Northern Kazakhstan that have actually occurred.    The local oppositional press has published a declaration of  the deputy faction Russian Way of the Russian Federation State  Duma (Yu. Vlasov, S. Baburin, A. Lukyanov, and others). In  particular, the declaration says: "The Russian way in  interethnic relations means bringing back the relationship of  friendship and fraternity among all peoples populating an  ethnically diverse Russia, removing all obstacles to the  development of national culture, language, and educational  system...Russia as a united, genuinely federated state which  consistently translates into life the norms of the Federation  Treaty...Russia as the main attracting force for the recreation  of a new, voluntary unity of peoples residing in the territory  of the erstwhile USSR."    Against the background of these events, the formation of the  Siberian Cossack Host out of various Cossack societies that  recently occurred in Omsk will create an unpredictable and  explosive situation in our region; the Host will soon become a  component of the Siberian Military District. If emergency  measures are not taken, after a certain period of time Omsk and  Kurgan Oblasts of Russia, as well as Pavlodar and Northern  Kazakhstan Oblasts of Kazakhstan may become the zone of a  broad-scale interethnic conflict. As I see it, a way out of the  existing situation is found in forming a united economic space  out of Omsk, Kurgan, and Tyumen Oblasts of Russia and Northern  Kazakhstan Oblast of Kazakhstan, even more so because the  Trans-Siberian Main Line that connects Siberia with the central  regions of Russia runs through this territory, and in  implementing to the full extent Decree No. 205-II by the head of  the Omsk Oblast Administration, dated 1 June 1993. In  particular, the decree refers to the need to create zones of  free crossborder trade in the rayons of Omsk Oblast adjacent to  the Republic of Kazakhstan and the establishment of free  enterprise zones in Omsk Oblast.</p>

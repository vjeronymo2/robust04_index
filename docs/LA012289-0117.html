			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> INDEPENDENT PROBE  </P> <P> In your article, "Consul Says Agents Shot 2 Mexicans From Behind," (Jan. 14),  it is stated that three undocumented migrant workers were shot in their back,  back of the skull and buttocks by members of the Border Patrol and the San  Diego police.  </P> <P> The way the events developed is unclear, but the allegations made by a Mexican  diplomat and a San Diego lawyer directly contradict the neat official version.  </P> <P> It is imperative to obtain the real story. This implies an independent  investigation of events by agencies not linked to the Border Patrol and San  Diego Police Department, which are parties in the deaths of the alleged  undocumented migrant workers.  </P> <P> Furthermore, in my opinion, it is necessary to obtain a clear statement from  the authorities in charge of the Border Crime Prevention Unit clarifying the  role and orders of this controversial task force whose preventive measures have  resulted in 18 deaths since its creation.  </P> <P> NESTOR FANTINI  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

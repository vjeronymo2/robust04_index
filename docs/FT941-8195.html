			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / Equity Markets: Investors scan the horizon for clouds - New York Wall Street is taking a well-deserved rest today to mark Presidents' Day, but many investors will no doubt take a moment out during the holiday to reflect on the stormy events of last week. When investors and brokers return to their trading screens tomorrow, few will have any doubts that the market is now in a period of transition. Amid the uncertainty which that has engendered, analysts see a further weakening of share prices over the next week or two. Mr Joseph McAlinden, director of research at Dillon Read in New York, sees a general downward bias over the next month or two, although stocks could well trade a little higher this week. 'But any gains should be viewed in the context of a correction,' he cautions. The turning point for the financial markets came a fortnight ago, when the Federal Reserve decided to tighten monetary policy for the first time in five years. But the true implications of the move were only driven home last Thursday and Friday, when the underlying optimism which had driven the financial markets forward seemed to have finally broken. During both sessions, investors appeared to be in mourning the bygone days when interest rates would only go down. In the bond market, holders of the inflation-sensitive 30-year issue were unconsoled by data showing no increase in consumer prices last month. Instead, they drove yields over 6.60 per cent for the first time since July, on the strength of a second-tier report showing some Philadelphia manufacturers had paid higher prices for materials. By force of habit, stocks followed Treasury prices lower, just as they have followed them up over the life of the three-year bull market. 'The Fed has bruised the market, there is no doubt about that,' says Mr Don Hays, market strategist at Wheat First Butcher &amp; Singer in Norfolk, Virginia. 'It is now in a healing period, and (last week) was a classic illustration of that.' Instead of searching for silver linings, he argues, investors are scanning the horizon for clouds. One of the clouds in investors' sights last week will arrive today. Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, is scheduled to present his twice-yearly Humphrey Hawkins testimony on monetary policy to a congressional committee. Analysts fear that no matter what Mr Greenspan says, the market will find good cause to trade down. Will stocks necessarily follow? Only so far, say analysts. Looking back at the Philadelphia manufacturing data, Mr McAlinden finds reason for guarded optimism. He points out that higher prices may indeed bring even higher interest rates, but the trend also suggests improved corporate earnings in some sectors. In that regard, he sees no fundamental change in a dynamic that has powered the market since the autumn. 'The two forces are involved in a tug of war,' he says. For a few weeks, anyway, the interest-rate bears are likely to be dominant.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Bankers' leader warns 'free' service being put at risk 'FREE' BANKING for personal customers who stay in credit is being put at risk by the efforts of high street banks to end subsidies for loss-making business, the British Bankers' Association warned yesterday. Sir Nicholas Goodison, association president, said free banking was 'not likely to be sustainable' as banks ended such internal subsidies. 'If somebody is providing a service, why shouldn't they charge for it?' he said. Although many bankers privately believe 'free' personal banking - introduced in 1984 and 1985 - is unlikely to last, Sir Nicholas's comment is one of the first public statements to this effect by a senior banker. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank and association vice-president, added that 'far from being too profitable, you have to question whether we are sufficiently profitable'. Banks want to end internal subsidies because they fear undercutting by competitors in the more profitable parts of their businesses. One bank estimates that 80 per cent of bank current accounts are now loss-making. Sir Nicholas, chairman of TSB Group, said at a briefing that individual banks would choose when and if to bring in charges. He said some politicians who saw banks as 'public utilities' criticised them unfairly for making profits. He also said the association supported in principle a call from foreign banks for a register of corporate loans to prevent lending to companies with excessive debts. But it was unclear whether such a register was practical. The association is considering how complete such a register could be. It believes there will be difficulties in cataloguing all forms of company borrowing because London is an international financial centre. The Foreign Banks and Securities Houses Association has sent a proposal to the Bank of England and the association which hints that overseas banks may reduce their commitment to London if a register is not created. The association also disclosed that complaints made after January 26 this year from small businesses about bank maladministration could be considered by Mr Laurence Shurman, the banking ombudsman.</p>

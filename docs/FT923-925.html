			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / French bank's fate hinges on chairman: Analysts may be losing patience with Jean-Yves Haberer's mounting provisions at Credit Lyonnais Perhaps the grandest of the grandiose bank buildings on the Boulevard des Italiens in Paris is number 19 which was built in the 1870s as the headquarters of Credit Lyonnais, a leading bank in the city of Lyons, then making its first move into the French capital. The Credit Lyonnais board was not at all sure its excursion into Paris would work. Just in case, it built the new headquarters in the design of a department store, so the building could be converted if the bank beat a retreat back to Lyons. For the past few years the joke running around the other banks on the Boulevard des Italiens has been that number 19 may yet be turned into a department store. Whenever a group of international bankers gathers together the fate of Credit Lyonnais, one of the biggest of France's state-controlled banks, and of its controversial chairman, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, is almost always on the agenda. Since he became chairman four years ago, Mr Haberer has pursued a strategy of international expansion and aggressive lending which, his fellow bankers say, may make or break Credit Lyonnais. Earlier this week Credit Lyonnais fanned the flames of the debate by announcing a collapse in net profits from FFr1.61bn in the first six months of 1991, to just FFr119m (Pounds 13.7m) in the first half of this year. The reason for the fall was a hefty increase in provisions on bad debts and sour investments from FFr3.37bn to FFr6.25bn over the same period. Banking analysts, who had been bracing themselves for a slight fall in interim profits to between FFr1.3bn and FFr1.6bn, were taken completely by surprise. So it seemed was Thomson-CSF, the state-controlled French electronics group which is one of Credit Lyonnais' largest minority shareholders with a 15.5 per cent stake. Thomson-CSF issued a profits warning immediately after Credit Lyonnais' results. It chairman, Mr Alain Gomez, was quick to identify the cause of his company's problems - Credit Lyonnais. The bank has grown accustomed to criticism under the chairmanship of Mr Haberer. But until now banking analysts have been prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt. The critical question is whether the shock of the interim results, coupled with Mr Haberer's warning that there will be another steep set of provisions in the second half, has erased the benefit. The first signs of strain emerged last summer when Credit Lyonnais unveiled a fall in net profits from FFr3.71bn in 1990 to FFr3.16bn in 1991. It also announced an increase in client risk provisions from FFr4.2bn to FFr9.5bn - the legacy of Mr Haberer's loans to clients including Mr Robert Maxwell, the disgraced British media magnate, and Olympia &amp; York, the collapsed Canadian property concern. The 1991 figures also accentuated the positive aspects of Mr Haberer's strategy. The restructuring of the French retail banking network was bearing fruit, as was the group's expansion into retail banking across Europe and into investment banking in the US. Moreover, although Credit Lyonnais, appeared more precarious than its fellow French banks, the level of its provisions as a proportion of total loans (at around 1.6 per cent) was far lower than those of its UK and US competitors. Analysts were still reasonably sanguine. Times have changed. This week's interim profits were well below expectations. 'We all knew they were going to be bad, but not that bad,' said Mr Keith Brown, banking analyst at Morgan Stanley in London. The situation was scarcely improved by Mr Haberer's insouciant reaction to the results: 'It's one half year, no more and no less.' Analysts are even more concerned about the level of Credit Lyonnais' first-half provisions and by the warning of more to come. Their concern has been aggravated by Credit Lyonnais' refusal to specify exactly what the provisions consist of, and whether it has finished writing down critical portfolios such as its Dollars 350m (Pounds 205m) exposure to Olympia &amp; York and its Dollars 215m of loans to Mr Maxwell. All Credit Lyonnais will say about the interim provisions is that they come from three sources: losses on loans to small businesses in France and on French property investments; failed film investments (including MGM, the stricken Hollywood studio) made by its Dutch subsidiary; and from bad debts to international enterprises, including Olympia &amp; York. 'How can we be expected to come to a sensible assessment when Credit Lyonnais won't tell us what provisions it has already made and how much is left?' said Ms Sheila Garrard, banking analyst at Shearson Lehmann in London. Most analysts are now much more sceptical about Credit Lyonnais' prospects for the full financial year. 'It's impossible to say how much it'll make but it certainly won't be anywhere near our original forecast of FFr3.6bn,' said Morgan Stanley's Mr Brown. In the meantime Moody's, the international credit rating agency, has put Credit Lyonnais' long-term debt rating under review for possible downgrade for the second time in a year. As for the long term, analysts are concerned that Mr Haberer's corporate style may turn out to have been too risky for Credit Lyonnais. 'This is a bank that has pursued a high-risk strategy and, if all goes well, in five years' time we could all be saying 'Wow]',' said Ms Garrard of Shearson Lehmann. 'A year ago I still thought that might happen. Now I'm not so sure.'</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Schroders ahead Schroders, the merchant bank, delivered the best individual performance of any of the FT-SE 100 stocks as it announced net profits far in excess of market expectations. Net income amounted to Pounds 140.3m, compared with the most optimistic forecasts of around Pounds 120m. The dividend total was also well ahead of expectations. Ironically, Schroders is one of the casualties of the most recent screening of FT-SE 100 constituents and is scheduled to drop out of the UK market's premier index as from Monday. Schroders ordinary were up 80 at 1170p, after 1185p, on turnover of 1m shares. Schroders' doubled net profits followed similarly bumper results from other merchant banks in recent weeks. SG Warburg, the UK's premier merchant bank and also a FT-SE 100 constituent, managed only a slight improvement at 803p, but Kleinwort Benson advanced 16 to 548p, Hambros 14 to 378p and Close Brothers 15 to 540p.</p>

			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Reed tumbles Magazine publisher Reed International fell heavily as full-year figures were accompanied by a disappointing statement. The shares lost 27 at 878p on exceptionally heavy volume of 4m. The Dutch arm Elsevier fell 2.4 per cent. The market focused on cautious comments concerning the pick-up in the price of raw materials and the difficulty of raising the price of the end product in a period of low inflation. Smith New Court, which had a top of the range forecast of Pounds 628m for the combined group's 1994 figures, trimmed by Pounds 10m and argued that the rating was up with events in the short term. However, like many analysts, it felt the market had reacted badly to the statement. Ms Chris Munro of Hoare Govett pointed out that Reed had already made allowances for the paper and print price rises by locking in costs. Meanwhile, the squeeze from suppliers was signalled by confidence from Arjo Wiggins Appleton. Profits of Pounds 122.1m were at the low end of forecasts. But analysts raised estimates to around Pounds 175m for 1994 on the belief that paper price rises of between 4 and 5 per cent in January were sticking. The shares jumped 15 to 302p. Relief that figures from United Biscuits were not as bad as some had feared helped to lift the shares 11 to 349p on turnover of 6.2m. Speculation of poor trading, particularly at US subsidiary Keebler, had dogged the stock in recent weeks, a situation undermined by large provisions made recently by other food manufacturing groups. UB made a Pounds 110m provision, mostly against Keebler, although this was offset to some extent by a good performance by the snack foods business outside the UK. In spite of this, some analysts continue to fret over the US business, although others took a more optimistic view. 'They have bitten the bullet on Keebler,' was the opinion of one. Keen jockeying ahead of next week's Opec meeting and strong oil share performance overnight in the US pumped up activity in the sector. Two camps  -one believing the weak oil price is about to go up, the other fearing it has further to fall - made for heavy turnover, with much interest focused on British Petroleum, which added 9 at 369p as 12m shares changed hands. Turnover in Enterprise Oil soared to 9.7m after a chunk of 3.5m shares was placed in the market at 408 1/2 p late in the session. Enterprise closed at 413p, up 2. Fears over its treasury operations in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia knocked 15 from the price of HSBC, which ended at 824p. The bank announced a change in its treasury operations, but rumours that it would reveal losses had gripped earlier trading. A sharp improvement in profits for Legal &amp; General saw the life insurer's shares move up 8 to 510p. L&amp;G announced full-year profits of Pounds 181m, against Pounds 116.1m last time. Reuters recovered 13 to 2021p after the group said it would meet with the Chicago Board of Trade to iron out a dispute over Globex, Reuters' after-hours electronic trading system for futures and options. Conglomerate Hanson gained 4 1/2 at 284p in active trade of some 14m shares as the company held a presentation in London to analysts and institutions and announced its intention to expand into the Pacific Rim. Buying in the US on Wednesday night lifted the London price of some leading stocks. Glaxo, which has underperformed the market recently, advanced 14 to 690p, while ICI rose 12 to 787p. Engineering group Lucas Industries shrugged off recent weakness after Henderson Crosthwaite issued a buy circular on the stock ahead of Monday's interim figures. The shares appreciated 6 to 215p on volume of 3.2m. Car repair group Kwik-Fit forged ahead 11 to 167 1/2 p after reporting a 49 per cent increase in full-year figures. Metals group Johnson Matthey hardened 3 to 571p after announcing a joint venture with industrial materials company Cookson Group. The latter, a strong performer in recent sessions, eased a penny to 282p on profit-taking. Figures from environmental services company Rentokil Group fell below market expectations, leaving the shares trailing 7 1/2 at 248 1/2 p as several brokers downgraded profits estimates.</p>

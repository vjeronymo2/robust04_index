			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Economics: Focus on US data and German rates Attention this week will be divided between the US, where economic statistics are expected to reinforce the picture of weak economic recovery, and the European continent, where pressure on Germany to cut interest rates will build up ahead of Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting. These events could harden attitudes among the world's seven leading industrial countries before meeting in Tokyo next week for this year's G7 economic summit. In the US, Thursday's National Association of Purchasing Managers' index is expected to point to stagnation in the industrial economy. While consumer confidence is expected to have recovered somewhat in June, Friday's important labour market data for the past month will offer little comfort to the administration. Pressure on the Bundesbank to ease policy has proved counterproductive in the past and German inflation data this week is unlikely to encourage rate cuts. After Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, ruled out lowering British borrowing costs last week, interest in the UK will focus on the new leadership at the Bank of England. The main economic statistics and events of the week follow. In brackets are the median of economists' forecasts, from MMS International, a financial information company.

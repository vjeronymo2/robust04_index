			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Books: Seeking myth in dirty realist territory - Fiction THE VILLAGE by David Mamet Faber Pounds 14.99, 238 pages David Mamet's first novel is an assured, impressionistic, unhurried account of a year in the life of a remote, unnamed New England village. It begins with a flurry of interior monologues and colloquial dialogue from unknown and undescribed characters. The conversations are so oblique, and Mamet is so determined not to make life easy for us, that the initial effect is like being at a party where nobody talks to you and nobody bothers to introduce you to the other guests. This can be irritating, not to say downright infuriating. But eventually the reader finds a point of access, starts to feel at home and to know who's who and what they are talking about. This is, as it were, an ensemble piece and there is no single protagonist, but gradually we get to know the characters: Dick, who owns the local hardware store and is going slowly, tortuously bankrupt; Henry, a newcomer to the village whose head is full of new man, New Age confusion; Maris, a youthful, sexual free spirit who comes to a nasty if inevitably ambiguous end. And there is a full supporting cast that includes wife-beaters, gun enthusiasts, hunters and story-tellers. The novel is set in an unspecified, though strangely dated and nostalgic present. Characters have phones and pick-up trucks for instance, but if there are computers or televisions or fax machines then nobody talks about them. Nobody goes to the movies or listens to popular music, which is a shame in some ways because these people would learn a lot about themselves from watching, say, The Last Picture Show or from listening to almost anything by Bruce Springsteen. There are times when we appear to be in standard dirty realist territory, but other times Mamet seems to be yearning after something mythic rather than realist. We have little sense of an outer world. We do not know who the president is or what stage the cold war is at, but Mamet's point would no doubt be that his characters' lives are little affected by such niceties, that they exist in a more elemental region. But Mamet does not quite achieve that mythic dimension, and perhaps that is largely because he wants it so badly. The strain sometimes shows. Of course, Mamet's dialogue is a wonderfully ornate and artificial approximation of real speech (I was remined of Ivy Compton-Burnett), and the detailed precision of his prose can sometimes sound like stage directions, but this is not some dilettantish piece by a successful Broadway and Hollywood writer flexing his muscles in a different genre. At a time when so many novels read like raw material for the movies, Mamet has found exactly the right form for what he has to say. The best parts of the book are a series of virtuoso small scale set-pieces: a man chops wood; the same man gets lost while trying to ski home through the snow; a State Trooper has to tell a father that his son is dead; a hunter stands all day in one spot waiting for the eventual and certain arrival of a deer. However, much as one can delight in these scenes, the reader is left surprisingly unengaged by characters and events, a lack of engagement that Mamet himself seems to share. He displays an icy detachment from his creations. He may be God-like but he is distinctly unaffectionate. The end result is a novel that it is easy to respect but very difficult to love.</p>

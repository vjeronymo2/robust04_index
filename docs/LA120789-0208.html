			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> A REMARKABLY FRANK RENDITION OF 'LES LIAISONS'  </P> <P> "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" should be played lusty, unzippered, untouched by  moral reserve. If a director pulls back, the sexual adventurism and venal  boudoir politics won't carry much weight; they might as well be a series of  randy skits on the Benny Hill show.  </P> <P> Director Gary Krinke unlaces "Liaisons"' corsets at Fullerton College.  Actually, "unlaces" is polite -- at times, he just about rips them free.  Especially considering the campus setting, this is a remarkably frank  production.  </P> <P> Krinke doesn't let things go too far. Everything is more suggested than  realized (and there isn't any nudity). The actors startle at times but they  shouldn't offend, unless your point of view is especially conservative.  </P> <P> There is, however, one particularly unsettling scene. Valmont's mental and  physical assault on the young, virginal Cecile does leave an itch, as it is  played primarily for laughs. To a college audience that probably has been  counseled on "date rape," these moments may seem a coarse trivialization of  sexual confusion.  </P> <P> Ultimately, though, "Liaisons" should be seen as a piece set in its own period.  In Christopher Hampton's play, on which both the "Dangerous Liaisons" and Milos  Forman's recently released "Valmont" films are based, Paris of the 1780s is a  city bloated with desire. Sex and conquest are the favorite sports, and the  nobles are particularly good at both. They're ignorant of the coming  revolution; they'd rather play games.  </P> <P> None is better than the Marquise de Merteuil (Kat Van Schaik) and Valmont  (Brian Kojac), former lovers who are so effete that they can only be energized  by exploiting their fellows.  </P> <P> "Liaisons" rotates around a bet. The Marquise offers herself to Valmont if he  can seduce the lovely but chaste Mme. de Tourvel (Julie Guevara), and Valmont  accepts. Other liaisons erupt and are left in his wake. Valmont finds his own  Waterloo in all this busybodying.  </P> <P> Krinke's cast is competent enough, though some of the actors may seem too young  for such sophisticated maneuverings. Van Schaik brings a hardened appetite to  the Marquise that serves well, and Kojac's Valmont is a preening sensualist of  the first order (just look at him writhe during his massage). This Valmont is  too glib, though, a trait that lowers the currency on his supposedly  inestimable charm.  </P> <P> Since "Liaisons" is such a visual period piece, the costumes had better be  good. Mela-Hoyt-Heydon's are very good. Bob Jensen's pristinely white sets are  graceful, as is Dan Michelson's clever lighting.  </P> <P> 'LES LIAISONS DANGEREUSES'  </P> <P> A Fullerton College production of Christopher Hampton's play.

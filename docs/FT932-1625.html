			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / 2% limit on water bill rises urged OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday called for rises in water bills to be held to about 2 per cent a year, in line with likely rises in household income, Bronwen Maddox writes. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, said: 'Escalating price increases must stop.' He added: 'A continuing increase in prices, well above the rate of inflation, will not be acceptable to customers.' Ofwat's annual report for the year to March 1993, published yesterday, showed that customer complaints to its regional committees rose by 39 per cent last year to 14,795. Of these, 62 per cent were about rising prices and other problems with bills. The sharp annual rises in bills are due to the industry's modernisation, costing some Pounds 45bn, which is driven by new UK and European environmental regulations. Mr Byatt said yesterday that the water companies' market plans, which estimate capital spending for the next decade, showed that water prices would have to rise by an average 6.25 per cent a year between 1995 and 2000 on top of inflation to cover all likely spending. The report also said that despite a 12 per cent reduction during the year, disconnections remained high with 18,635 homes cut off.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTLOOK FOR THE '90S;  </P> <P> FOR BUSINESS, THE 1980S WERE A PERIOD OF ENORMOUS TURMOIL. A JAPANESE SIEGE OF  THE HIGH-TECHNOLOGY AND AUTO INDUSTRIES, A SURGE AND PLUNGE IN OIL PRICES,  MASSIVE FAILURES OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND A FEARSOME STOCK CRASH. THE  1990S DON'T PROMISE MUCH PEACE AND QUIET. HERE'S A LOOK AT WHAT BUSINESS FACES  IN THE NEXT DECADE.;  </P> <P> ENERGY  </P> <P> The oil business started the 1980s with gas lines, stalled with a worldwide oil  price collapse, accelerated with a wave of megamergers, stalled again when the  Exxon Valdez ran aground and is now creeping cautiously into the '90s.  </P> <P> In the 1990s, the nation's demand for energy will confront environmental  worries in the wake of the Valdez incident, drilling bans, clean-air laws and  concerns about global warming, the so-called greenhouse effect.  </P> <P> Oil prices that fell in 1986 to about $9 should hold at the current $19 or $20  a barrel at least through the early part of the decade. Such prices would help  the recovery of an industry still reeling from a decade of restructuring,  downsizing and streamlining.  </P> <P> The 1990s could see a modest resurgence of alternative sources of energy --  perhaps even a smaller, safer nuclear industry. But most analysts expect  continued reliance on oil.  </P> <P> New technology should lead to more efficient energy use and improve production  from existing U.S. wells. Currently off-limits areas such as the Arctic  National Wildlife Refuge and coastal areas could eventually be opened to  exploration.  </P> <P> But few analysts expect U.S. oil production to turn up again, and the U.S. oil  industry will become more international, with most exploration and production  taking place overseas -- especially in Pacific Rim areas.  </P> <P> The big question will be when oil companies can expect the already overdue  collapse of the so-called natural gas bubble, or oversupply. New clean-air  regulations should increase demand for cleaner-burning gas, which is also used  to make methanol and other alternative fuels. That would lead to higher prices  -- and that would be good news for U.S. companies with sizable reserves.  </P> <P> Because U.S. oil and gas production fell in the 1980s, imports increased, and  that has set the stage for a re-emergence of the Organization of Petroleum  Exporting Countries as a world force -- if it can keep quotas in line.  </P> <P> In any case, national oil companies of countries such as Kuwait, Venezuela and  Saudi Arabia will dominate the worldwide industry, analysts say. Those  companies will continue moving into the refining and marketing end of the  business in the United States and elsewhere.  </P> <P> As the 1980s showed, developments in the oil business can come swiftly and  unexpectedly, and analysts are not ruling out price shocks or shortages later  in the decade.

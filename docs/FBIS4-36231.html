			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Gid'on Alon] </F>   [Excerpt] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres has warned that if  we do not continue the negotiating impetus with the Palestinians  to extend the autonomy to other areas in the West Bank, the  intifadah might be reignited. Peres, who addressed the Labor  caucus, was sharply criticized by several faction members, who  claimed that the government should not hurry to expand the  self-rule area.    Labor Secretary General Nisim Zvili said the public feels  that we should not rush ahead toward the next stages of the  negotiations. He said we do not need to run faster than we  undertook in the negotiations. Deputy Defense Minister  Mordekhay Gur said that the main problem is that the coming  stages in the negotiations include all the areas of Judaea,  Samaria, and the Gaza Strip. Knesset Member 'Imanu'el Sussman  retorted angrily: "You want to go on to the second stage, and I  ask: What will happen in the area between Ma'ale Adumim and  Jerusalem?"    The foreign minister said it is preferable to impose some  self-rule on all the territories rather than all the self-rule  on some of the territories. He said that the accord with the  PLO opened up markets for us. "The agreement constitutes a big  success, and I suggest not to pay attention to denigrations from  all sides. For the first time in this century, we helped our  partner take part in the peace process," Peres said. He said  this was the first time Jerusalem has been removed from the  self-rule.

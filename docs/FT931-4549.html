			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds its own in spite of profit-taking Wall Street US SHARE prices were little changed yesterday as investors and dealers consolidated Monday's record-breaking gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.70 firmer at 3,472.12. The index spent the entire session only a few points on either side of opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in a similar fashion and ended 0.31 off at 454.40, while the American SE composite finished 2.29 higher at 419.02 and the Nasdaq composite up 1.73 at 688.96. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 290.7m shares. Early trading was dominated by profit-taking, as investors sought to book some of Monday's gains. Yet, in spite of the selling, prices held their own, an indication of the resilience of the market, which remains supported by extremely low interest rates, low inflation, and hopes for continued improvements in corporate profitability. Prices may also have been aided yesterday by further indications from the White House that President Clinton is willing to accommodate more spending cuts in his first budget. On Monday, reports said that the president would accept an additional Dollars 55bn in cuts; by yesterday that figure had risen to Dollars 90bn. Analysts have warned, however, that stock prices could be hit by a short-term correction over the next week or so. Some remain nervous about the Dow's record highs, fearing that prices may have risen too far, making stocks overly expensive in relation to future corporate earnings. Banks remained in demand as investors bought them in the expectation that low interest rates will boost bank earnings. BankAmerica climbed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 53, additionally helped by a ratings upgrade from broking house PaineWebber, while Citicorp added Dollars 1 at Dollars 28, Wells Fargo Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 and Chemical Dollars 1 at Dollars 42 7/8 . American Express rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 and Primerica jumped Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 44 3/4 after the two groups confirmed that they were in talks which could lead to Primerica buying the brokerage and asset management operations of American Express's troubled Shearson Lehman unit. Safeway moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 13 7/8 as investors continued to respond to Monday's news that Mr Peter Magowan, the food retailer's chairman, is stepping down as chief executive to run a baseball team in California. HJ Heinz declined Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/8 after the company issued a profits warning, saying that the wild fluctuations in European currencies had hurt its bottom line. Some leading drug stocks were under pressure, with Pfizer Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 59 3/4 and Bristol Myers-Squibb down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 57 1/8 . Canada TORONTO stocks ended on a mixed note after further heavy trading, as a continued rally among mining shares was offset by a decline among financial services issues. The TSE 300 index edged 2.2 higher to 3,553.2 and rises narrowly led falls by 333 to 308 after volume of 54.2m shares. Ten of 14 stock groups closed ahead, with mining adding 1.5 per cent. The stocks of two major companies in the Hees-Edper group rose in spite of releasing substantially weaker 1992 results. Hees International Bancorp gained CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 9 1/4 and Brascan 'A' put on CDollars  5/8 at CDollars 11 7/8 .</p>

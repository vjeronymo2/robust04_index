			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / US probes aluminium pact The US Justice Department is investigating whether a worldwide agreement last January to cut production of aluminium may have led to violations of anti-trust law by the aluminium industry. The US Aluminum Association said it had received formal notice of an investigation into possible anti-trust violations stemming from the agreement to restrict production of primary aluminium. US aluminium producers have got similar notices. Ironically, the US government was one of the parties to the January agreement, which also involved Russia, the European Union, Canada, Norway and Australia, and was one of the keenest advocates of production restrictions to deal with a glut of aluminium on the world market. The agreement came in response to a flood of exports of primary aluminium from Russia, which had previously used most of its output for domestic military purposes. At the January meeting Russia agreed to cut production by 500,000 tonnes, or about 15 per cent, for two years, while western producers were expected to make voluntary cuts totalling around 1m tonnes.</p>

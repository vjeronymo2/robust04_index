			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Cellular telecoms AT&amp;T's purchase of McCaw for Dollars 12.6bn has put a very fancy price tag on cellular phone companies. AT&amp;T doubtless has its strategic objectives - having been shut out of local telephony in 1984, presumably it hopes that McCaw will provide a backdoor route back into the market. Radio is also a useful weapon for a phone company as technology widens the options for information transfer. Yet AT&amp;T has paid a very high price for what is only one plank in its strategic platform. The acquisition values McCaw's cellular customers at Dollars 270 each. By comparison, UK cellular phone companies are cheap. Vodafone's customers are only valued by the market at around Dollars 120 apiece. What's more, Vodafone and Cellnet are profitable, while McCaw has never made money, after its heavy interest payments. It is possible to cut the valuation gap between the two companies by cutting off the bid premium AT&amp;T has paid, discounting for spin off benefits AT&amp;T may reap and adjusting for the higher income of US subscribers. Even when that is done, however, Vodafone still looks cheap. Unfortunately for its shareholders it may remain so unless anyone is prepared to bid. AT&amp;T is probably the only company prepared to pay anything like Dollars 12bn for McCaw and, having done so, is most unlikely to bid for Vodafone. Apart from anything else, the goodwill write off would be prohibitive. Nor is BT likely to follow AT&amp;T's lead by mopping up Securicor's 40 per cent stake in Cellnet. BT can already exercise all the management control it needs, though why it has not done more to improve Cellnet's performance remains a mystery.</p>

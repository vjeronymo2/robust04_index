He added: Although war actions taking place a few kilometers  from our border with Mexico are dangerous, Guatemala could  benefit from the armed movement in that country, because if the  Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity supports openly that  movement it will lose the sympathy that it has enjoyed in Mexico  during certain moments.    Herbruger said during a news conference that he thinks it is  important for our country to adopt certain precautionary  measures to protect its border, without interfering in Mexico's  domestic affairs.    The Guatemalan official believes that the Mexicans will  react  negatively to the armed movement, because the people who live in  countries with constitutional regimes do not welcome violent  changes.    Meanwhile, Presidency Secretary General Hector Luna Troccoli  has said that the armed movement that has reemerged in Mexico is  a source of concern, because it threatens that country's  political stability, which has been traditional for over 60  years.    He added: It must be admitted, however, that the uprising is  understandable due to the extreme poverty in which the people of  Mexico's northern and southeastern region live, and this  situation, added to the political wear out of the Institutional  Revolutionary Party, has caused the situation that exists now.    Meanwhile, Felix Loarca Guzman, public relations secretary  of  the Presidency, has said that the guerrilla movement in Mexico  is a domestic matter of that country and the Guatemalan  Government cannot issue any opinion in that regard.</p>

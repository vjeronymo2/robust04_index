			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Brussels talks seek end to fish row with Spain European Union expansion from 12 to 15 nation-states from January 1 was still at risk last night, as the EU struggled to agree the terms of Spain's full integration into the Union's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). EU fisheries ministers were meeting in Brussels in an effort to put flesh on the bones of the tacit agreement brokered by the current German presidency of the EU at last week's summit of European leaders in Essen. But differences over details of Spanish access to waters west of the UK and Ireland, and over control mechanisms on over-fishing of diminishing stocks, were still far from being resolved, EU negotiators said. The Spanish government has said it will not complete ratification of enlargement  - set to bring Austria, Sweden, and Finland into the Union in January  - unless the CFP issue is settled. Spain and Portugal were promised in March that they would be fully integrated into the CFP by January 1996  - six years ahead of the date agreed in 1986 when the Iberian countries became member states. All member states agreed that if new member states were to get full rights then restrictions on the Spanish fleet  - the EU's largest  - could no longer be justified. Last spring's enlargement talks were in great part dominated by Spain's objections to allowing Norway to gain EU entry on terms far better than those offered to the Iberians. Norway is one of Europe's leading fishing powers, but, in the event, its people voted against membership. But Spain insists that a political deal was struck in March, and its parliament has told the Madrid government not to formalise ratification unless it is now delivered. At Essen, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Spanish prime minister Felipe Gonzalez are understood to have reached an agreement whereby there would be no discrimination against Spanish fishing vessels. Translating this into practice is, however, running up against a barrier of national interests. The UK and Ireland want to keep the Spanish fleet as far as possible out of the waters west of their two countries  - the so-called 'Irish Box' which Spanish fishermen traditionally know as the 'Gran Sol'  - while France also wants to restrict Spanish access in the Bay of Biscay, a traditional tuna and anchovy ground for Spain's northern fleet. Spain is currently subject to restrictions which allow 150 out of a list of 300 vessels into the Irish box at any one time. In a hardline document delivered to yesterday's meeting, Spain made clear it would not tolerate any restrictions which are not simultaneously applied to other EU fishing vessels.</p>

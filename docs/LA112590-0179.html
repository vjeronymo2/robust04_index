			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NBA;  </P> <P> ELLIS HAS GONE FROM A SONIC BOOM TO BUST  </P> <P> Dale Ellis and the Seattle SuperSonics are finally near splitsville. Like many  of Ellis' relationships, this one has been stormy.  </P> <P> The king of the post-up jump shooters fought Xavier McDaniel last week after a  practice in which several teammates taunted Ellis, persuading Coach K.C. Jones  to shorten the drill.  </P> <P> Ellis' rise and fall in the Pacific Northwest mirrors that of the SuperSonics:  </P> <P> July 23, 1986 -- Seattle acquires him from the Dallas Mavericks' bench for Al  Wood.  </P> <P> Spring, 1987 -- Ellis averages 25 points in the playoffs as the SuperSonics, a  39-43 team, surprise Dallas and Houston to reach West finals.  </P> <P> March 1, 1988 -- After a victory over the Lakers, Ellis' wife, Monique, engages  in a fight in public with Bobby Jo Lister, teammate Alton's spouse.  </P> <P> Jan. 8, 1989 -- Ellis is arrested after an argument with Monique, charged with  assault and resisting arrest and fined $346.  </P> <P> Jan. 12, 1990 -- Ellis crashes his car into an on-ramp abutment, suffers broken  ribs and a collapsed lung. He is convicted of drunken driving and sentenced to  one day in a rehab center.  </P> <P> Nov. 20, 1990 -- Ellis, who hasn't played this season because of a nerve  injury, arrives late for a home game against the New Jersey Nets, doesn't sit  on the bench but in owner Barry Ackerley's seat at half-court, irritating  teammates. Says Nate McMillan: "It shows who the big man around here is."  </P> <P> Nov. 21, 1990 -- McDaniel fights Ellis.  </P> <P> Aside from that, it's been routine.  </P> <P> Just asking: The Lakers are a fast-break team, right?  </P> <P> The best way to run is to play good defense, right?  </P> <P> Why not make one more adjustment in the starting lineup -- A.C. Green for Vlade  Divac -- to field their best defensive team? For all his potential, Divac is  the fourth option in the offense. His points aren't carrying anyone, and his  oft-slack defense hurts. Why not let him tear up No. 2 centers now and grow  into a starter later?  </P> <P> Say good night: After the Atlanta Hawks had lost a second time to the Charlotte  Hornets, the players held a closed-door meeting.  </P> <P> Said an unidentified Hawk to the Atlanta Constitution:  </P> <P> "It was pretty simple. We talked about how we went to management and said we  wanted the other guy (former coach Mike Fratello) out of here. We wanted a guy  who would treat us like men. (The Hawks subsequently hired mild-mannered Bob  Weiss).  </P> <P> "We're mishandling it. I think we all understand, if we don't turn things  around, we're the ones who'll leave."  </P> <P> Said General Manager Pete Babcock: "Mike Fratello told me it was important to  make changes in the nucleus of the club. Mike may have been correct."  </P> <P> First on most lists of potential deportees is aging Moses Malone, a poor fit in  Weiss' passing game. Meanwhile, the Hawks suffered their seventh consecutive  loss Saturday night.  </P> <P> It's hard to tell the expansion teams anymore.  </P> <P> The worst two records in each conference belong to old-line teams, so the new  members must be doing something right.  </P> <P> Minnesota -- Coups: former UCLA guard Pooh Richardson in the draft, former  Laker Tony Campbell in the expansion draft. Coach Bill Musselman's slow-down  style gives everyone trouble, but he's loath to play newcomers (Richardson sat  half a season behind, honest, Sidney Lowe; where's No. 1B pick Gerald Glass?),  and uses his starters in more than 80% of games.  </P> <P> Is this win-a-little-now stuff the way to build a team?  </P> <P> Musselman is eerily intense; Pat Reusse of the Star Tribune in Minneapolis  wrote that he has eyes "like a guy driving down a dirt road in Kansas after  just killing a farm house full of people."  </P> <P> Charlotte -- Coup: getting Armon Gilliam for Kurt Rambis. Original mistake:  passing up erratic big man Rony Seikaly for erratic guard Rex Chapman. Chapman  is catching fire at last, making 59% of his three-point attempts. However,  Seikaly is still 6 foot 11. Problem: owner George Shinn is Atlantic Coast  Conference-happy. He pressed for drafting North Carolina's J.R. Reid and  reportedly had to be talked out of dealing for former Virginian Ralph Sampson.  </P> <P> Orlando -- More of a veterans approach but strong drafts (rising star Nick  Anderson last year, Dennis Scott this time) offer hope. A sensation when the  Magic started 7-7 last season, but then the team went 11-57. Problem: desperate  for a big man. Greg Kite starts.  </P> <P> Miami -- Indifferent early results but Heat is doing it right, with young  players. Coups: Seikaly; Sherman Douglas, nabbed in '89's second round.  Cleverly crafted front-end-loaded offer sheet for John (Hot Rod) Williams might  have had Cleveland wondering if it was worth it to match. If the Heat had  pulled that one off, it might be close to making a run for the playoffs.  Problem: Coach Ron Rothstein is up-tight.  </P> <P> NBA Notes  </P> <P> Sacramento General Manager Jerry Reynolds on the Golden State Warriors: "They  probably could beat the Lakers for third in the division." . . . After a loss  at Boston, Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz said: "You look down at (the Celtics')  bench and you see players who are hungry. You look down at ours and see players  who don't belong in the league."  </P> <P> He'll be sorry: Detroit's John Salley continues to illustrate Piston balance by  taking shots at Michael Jordan. Said Salley: "It would be hard for Michael  Jordan to play on this team." . . . Add sorry: Seattle's Gary Payton had a good  exhibition game against Jordan and announced: "I can play defense on anyone,  even Michael Jordan." In their first real meeting, Jordan stole the ball from  Payton the first two times the rookie brought it up and went for 33 points.  </P> <P> The New Jersey Nets' Sam Bowie, before the team ended its record road losing  streak at 34 games: "The most obvious problem is we're not a good ball team,  whether we're at home or on the road." . . . Isiah Thomas, warned that another  poke in the eye might cost him his sight, threw away his goggles in frustration  over his shooting and scored 32 points at Indianapolis. Included were a short  jump shot with six seconds left in regulation to tie the game and two  three-pointers in overtime.  </P> <P> Did Alex English retire and forget to tell anyone? The former Nugget, 35, is  averaging 18 minutes, 6.5 points and shooting 33% in Dallas. . . . Maybe 15's  the charm: The Philadelphia 76ers signed Andre Turner and Jim Farmer to shore  up the backcourt after Johnny Dawkins' loss. Between them, Turner and Farmer  have been waived or left unprotected 14 times.  </P></p>

The afternoon  was relatively calm and most of the people abandoned their  hideouts to look for something to eat. If this situation  continues until tomorrow, it is very probable that a World Food  Program [WFP] aircraft will land in the city of Cuito with food  for the people who are once again experiencing a serious food  crisis. Our correspondent Abel Abraao reports.    If the calm experienced since early this afternoon continues  until tomorrow, WFP aircraft could land in the city bringing  food. If the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola  [UNITA] does not again shell the city in the coming few hours,  the thousands and thousands of residents hope to receive  assistance from international humanitarian organizations to save  them from famine which is killing people, particularly in Cunje  commune.    This afternoon we learned that four orphans, under the  control of the provincial branch of the Social Reintegration  Ministry, were killed and six others wounded in the latest UNITA  shellings.</p>

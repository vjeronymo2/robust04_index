			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / S Africa reconstruction levy sought AN OFFICIAL of the African National Congress yesterday called for the imposition of a heavy 'reconstruction levy' on individuals and corporations in South Africa to finance the building of a 'new and more equal' post-apartheid society. Writing in the Johannesburg Star newspaper, Mr Tito Mboweni, deputy head of the ANC economics department and one of its chief economic policy-makers, argued for a charge to be levied along the lines of Germany's post-war levy, under which individuals and corporations paid half of their assets to the state to help finance reconstruction. Such a levy is not official ANC policy, but Mr Mboweni's advocacy suggests that the organisation is seriously considering adopting it officially. Mr Mboweni made clear the levy would be compulsory: 'All South Africans who have the ability to contribute financially to the process of reconstruction should do so by law.' He added that normal budgetary resources were insufficient to finance post-apartheid development expenditure without creating unsustainable budget deficits. Mr Mboweni sought to reassure South Africans that 'there is no need for anybody to be scared' at the idea of a levy. However, his comments could well give cause for concern to the potential investors now being courted in the US by Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC leader. He is touring the US to raise election campaign funds for the ANC, and woo US investors.</p>

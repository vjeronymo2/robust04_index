			<p>BFN     [Text] According to government officials, today's road  blockade has failed. Social Communications Minister Ernesto  Machicado said that roadblocks were set up only in some parts of  the country:    [Begin Machicado recording] Our overall impression is that  as  a whole, the 10 national highways were not cut off by roadblocks.    However, I am now going to itemize the roadblocks that were  set up along specific points of the highways. This morning I  reported that a roadblock was set up in (Puentevilla), in the  Yungas region. This roadblock lasted all day long.    Roadblocks were set up all morning on the railroad tracks in  Oruro Department. Railroad tracks were also blockaded nearby  Vilavila. A roadblock was set up in Villa Tunari, in Cochabamba  Department. However, it is important to note that this part of  the highway is being repaired, because it was damaged.  Therefore, a few days ago National Road Service closed transit  through this highway. Therefore, this roadblock did not have  any impact whatsoever on traffic.    In Santa Cruz Department, roadblocks were set up in  (Pomarapa) during the morning; and also in La Angostura up to  2100 GMT.    In Chuquisaca Department, roadblocks were set up all day  long  in Luis Calvo Province, in (?Monteburro) and Muyupampa.    As we have already reported, in Potosi Department roadblocks  were set up at the (Cruce de Machas) intersection and  (?Petanzos). Both of these roadblocks were dispersed this  afternoon.    In Tarija Department, all (?streets) were blocked throughout  the morning. These are specific areas.    As I reported beforehand, if we review the situation of  roads  nationwide, we can conclude there was no generalized blockade of  national highways. [end recording]</p>

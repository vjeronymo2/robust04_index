			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Review of dentists' pay likely to propose shake-up The government plans to publish a long-awaited consultation paper this week which is likely to include proposals for restructuring of the dental health service. The Department of Health confirmed yesterday that it would probably publish on Thursday its first public response to the review of dentists' renumeration by Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, the former head of the Civil Service in Northern Ireland. Dr Brian Mawhinney, health minister, said the delay in publishing the green paper had come about mainly because of the lack of consensus in and outside the dental profession about how to make the service more cost-effective. Under the options presented by Sir Kenneth, reforms might include limiting treatment available under the health service, or restricting eligibility for free or subsidised dental care. The report favours keeping free treatment for children, but not necessarily for all pregnant women. Options put forward by Sir Kenneth include relatively minor changes. The government is believed to favour more radical reform, although it has not ruled out returning to free dental checks. Some dentists and doctors have claimed a rise in avoidable deaths from oral cancer since their abolition four years ago. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's health spokesman, predicted that the government plans were 'worse' that reports suggested, and that a 'hidden agenda' included denying free provision to pregnant women. He said yesterday: 'My feeling is that the government is moving into charges as an alternative to taxes.' Mr Michael Watson of the British Dental Association said yesterday he thought it likely that the government would lay out options and delay final decisions on the scope and funding of NHS dentistry. He said: 'We want a service that is clearly targeted where it is needed most and not just making it easier for the well off.'</p>

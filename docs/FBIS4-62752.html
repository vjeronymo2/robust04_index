			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Not all flight crews  are supporting the nationwide strike called for today by the  Russian pilots' union. Services are continuing on many routes,  above all those operated out of the capital's airports.    Nevertheless, as the public relations department of the  Russian Federation Ministry of Transport told ITAR-TASS,  departures have been cancelled or delayed in a number of cities.  In Ufa, for instance, nine flights were cancelled, and two in  St. Petersburg.    Meanwhile, the office of Russia's procurator-general has  filed suit against the pilots' union, calling for the strike to  be declared illegal. The case will be heard today.</p>

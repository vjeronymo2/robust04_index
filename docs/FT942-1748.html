			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Flexibility on state aid wins support A majority of EU industry ministers yesterday threw their weight behind a commission proposal to allow a flexible interpretation of state aid rules, in order to secure crucial capacity cuts in Europe's battered steel industry. At a meeting in Luxembourg ministers were persuaded by Mr Karel Van Miert, competition commissioner, that this was the only way to resurrect the steel rescue plan, which now - after weeks of uncertainty - looks set to survive. Only the UK and Denmark had reservations. They were worried that the commission would set a bad precedent by allowing state aid to be paid to steel mills in northern Italy in return for only partial closures of the enterprises. Under EU law, state aid is not supposed to be used to fund partial closures, but because of complex cross-ownership links among the Brescia mills, not all companies linked to steelmaking will close under the terms of the rescue plan. 'I am not entirely happy with what the commission proposes to do,' said Mr Tim Sainsbury, UK industry minister. 'That part of the plan that does not involve closure of full enterprises is not justified. I have reservations about how effectively the closures can be monitored and whether or not they will result in real reductions in capacity.' But Mr Van Miert said the commission intended to improve monitoring of the capacity cuts. It has agreed to take action against enterprises that do not meet the conditions for state aid payments, possibly by asking them to repay the aid. Mr Van Miert believes the reductions at Brescia will secure a further 5m tonnes of capacity cuts, taking total production reduction under the plan to around 16m, still short of the envisaged minimum capacity cuts of 19m tonnes. Although the commission did not need council assent on the steel plan, which falls under the competence of the commission, it was eager to get the political support of the member states.</p>

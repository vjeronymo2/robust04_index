			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOUBT, HOPE EXPRESSED ON OIL SPILL LAW;  </P> <P> LEGISLATION CLEARS HOUSE SUBCOMMITTEE  </P> <P> After the Argo Merchant tanker ran aground near Nantucket, Mass., in 1976,  spilling 7.6 million gallons of oil, Congress expressed concern about the  environmental hazards but never adopted major oil spill legislation.  </P> <P> Twelve years and an even worse oil spill later, Congress is again considering  legislation, which a congressional aide fears will suffer the same fate. But  Rep. Gerry Studds (D-Mass.), whose district includes Nantucket, is a bit more  hopeful.  </P> <P> In the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in March -- which succeeded the Argo  Merchant as the worst oil spill in U.S. history -- a House Merchant Marine and  Fisheries subcommittee voted favorably Wednesday on oil spill proposals.  </P> <P> Bill Woodward, staff director for the fisheries and wildlife subcommittee, said  Wednesday that he doubts that the bill will become law.  </P> <P> "It'll pass the House (as it has in various versions several times), but I have  been through this too often to be optimistic it will become law. Even after the  Valdez," Woodward said, noting that the Senate has not approved bills that step  on states' own spill legislation.  </P> <P> However, Studds said he is less pessimistic.  </P> <P> "If we get it, it will be because of the Alaska incident, which makes inaction  inexplicable. In Washington language, I guess you can say I'm hopeful," he  said.  </P> <P> "One of the lessons is that if things are not done quickly now in response to  the Valdez, we risk the chance that people will forget the tragedy," Woodward  said. "Twelve years from now we could be dealing with this again."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fisheries Affected  </P> <P> The Argo Merchant was carrying about 7.6 million gallons of oil on Dec. 15,  1976, when it ran aground 27 miles southeast of Nantucket, Mass., a resort  island south of Cape Cod, and subsequently was torn apart by storm waves.  </P> <P> The spill sent a slick more than 100 miles long across the rich fishing grounds  of Georges Bank.  </P> <P> On March 24, the Exxon Valdez slammed into a reef off Valdez, Alaska, spilling  nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. The accident has  fouled hundreds of miles of beaches, killing otters, sea birds and other  wildlife and wreaking havoc on the area's herring and salmon fisheries.  </P> <P> After the Argo Merchant accident, some legislation passed, including  requirements for improved radar, improved crew training and segregated ballasts  so that water used for ballast and eventually dumped would not be contaminated  with oil.  </P> <P> However, a comprehensive oil spill bill proposed in 1977 by President Jimmy  Carter, Studds and Sen. Warren Magnuson (D-Wash.), never became law.  </P> <P> The House subcommittee Wednesday approved yet another bill that may not pass  Senate muster because it includes a controversial provision to prohibit legal  action under state laws to recover damages from oil spillers. The Senate  historically has refused to accept federal preemption of state laws on the  issue.  </P> <P> The provision, dubbed by opponents as a gift to polluters, would limit  liability of oil companies for spill damages to provisions of the federal law.  </P> <P> Other measures proposed, but never adopted since the Argo Merchant accident,  include requiring protective double hulls on oil tankers and having more oil  spill strike teams. President Ronald Reagan cut back Carter's proposal of 11  teams to two. The subcommittee Wednesday approved an amendment to finance two  more strike teams.  </P></p>

The name of the pilot was withheld pending  notification of relatives.  </P> <P> Another Cessna 172 and its pilot, Jerry Dell Teel, 48, of San Bernardino, were  found by hikers at nearly 12,000 feet in Sequoia National Park, deputies said.  Teel's plane disappeared during a heavy snowstorm in January, and a weeklong  search failed to locate the craft.  </P></p>

Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 2 ROYAL ULSTER OFFICERS FOUND SLAIN  </P> <P> Two policemen, one a high-ranking officer in the Royal Ulster Constabulary,  were found shot to death today near the border with the Irish Republic,  bringing this year's death toll in Northern Ireland to 26.  </P> <P> The bodies of the two men were found in County Armagh in an unmarked car only  yards from the border at the Catholic village of Jonesborough, police said. A  spokesman at constabulary headquarters said no further details were available.  He could not explain why the officers, believed to be in civilian clothes, were  in the area described as "bandit country" by Merlyn Rees, former secretary of  state for Northern Ireland. He would not confirm if the two dead officers had  been working undercover.  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SOUTHLAND;  </P> <P> DEATH SENTENCE IN 3 MURDERS UPHELD  </P> <P> The state Supreme Court today upheld the death sentence of a Los Angeles man  for murdering two men and a woman during a drug-related robbery in 1979.  </P> <P> The 6-1 decision in the case of Jesse James Andrews, 39, was the first majority  opinion by Justice Joyce L. Kennard, appointed to the court by Gov. George  Deukmejian in April. The only dissenter, Justice Stanley Mosk, said Los Angeles  Superior Court Judge Aurelio Munoz should have told jurors that they could  consider showing mercy to Andrews. Mosk said the jury instructions suggested  improperly that "the exercise of mercy was in fact illegitimate."  </P></p>

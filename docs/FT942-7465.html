			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / International Company News: Shareholders delay Moulinex shake-up Moulinex, the troubled French household electricals company, yesterday faced a last-minute hitch in the completion of its long-awaited financial restructuring package when its shareholders postponed until this afternoon a vote on bringing in a new investor. The company, which also disclosed that it sustained an unexpectedly heavy net loss of FFr550m (Dollars 97.7m) in its last financial year to March 31, yesterday morning announced plans for a FFr1bn rights issue. But it can only proceed with the issue after its shareholders have appointed the new investor. Moulinex, which is controlled by Finap, a company owned by its founders and employees, has for months been in negotiations with prospective investors. It has received firm offers from Glen Dimplex, an Irish competitor, and Euris, a French investment consortium. The Moulinex workforce earlier this year voiced its opposition to the Glen Dimplex offer on the grounds that it could lead to job losses. Moreover the company's executives last week voted in favour of accepting the Euris bid. The completion of the financial restructuring will end years of uncertainty for Moulinex which has been in deep difficulty since its acquisition in 1991 of Krups, a German competitor. The Krups deal made sense in strategic terms as it enabled Moulinex, best known for food processors and Swan kettles, to expand into new product sectors such as expresso coffee machines. But the Krups acquisition also left Moulinex with heavy debts on the eve of the economic recession. The company fell into the red in the 1992-93 financial year with a net loss of FFr115m on sales of FFr8.22bn, only to sustain even heavier losses last year. Moulinex, which has made dramatic cuts in its workforce to try to stabilise its finances, said it had been forced to make provisions of roughly FFr500m in the 1993-94 financial year.</p>

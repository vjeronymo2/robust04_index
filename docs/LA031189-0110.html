			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGER NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> DEVEREAUX, MORGAN WATCH AS ORIOLES WIN, 3-0  </P> <P> Whatever interest the Baltimore Orioles may have in Dodger outfielder Mike  Devereaux, it was well concealed by both teams Friday.  </P> <P> Devereaux made the three-hour bus trip here from Vero Beach, then spent the  entire game on the bench during the Dodgers' 3-0 exhibition loss to the  Orioles. So much for showcasing.  </P> <P> "I can't say anything unless it happens, and all I know is I didn't play  today," said a slightly bewildered Devereaux, who has been hearing rumors of a  deal with the Orioles for months.  </P> <P> At first, he thought he was headed for Baltimore during trade talks for Eddie  Murray.  </P> <P> "When I was in Puerto Rico playing, I was walking to the plate when they  announced in the stadium that I had been traded," Devereaux said. "Then when I  went home, I heard the same thing on TV."  </P> <P> Instead, however, the Dodgers packaged Ken Howell, Brian Holton and minor  league shortstop Juan Bell for Murray.  </P> <P> But the trade rumors revived this spring, with Devereaux headed to the Orioles  for pitcher Mike Morgan, the one-time teen-age phenom -- Charlie Finley signed  him to a big league contract a week after his high school graduation -- who has  played for five big league teams.  </P> <P> Earlier this week, Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire sat in the rain  watching Morgan pitch two innings of a B game at Port St. Lucie. But while  everything seemed to indicate that a trade is imminent, it hasn't happened yet.  </P> <P> "I'd like to know," Devereaux said. "It's kind of hard when it's always in your  mind."  </P> <P> It's also kind of funny.  </P> <P> "Every day when I come to the clubhouse, guys say to me, 'You're still here?' "  Devereaux said.  </P> <P> Franklin Stubbs, whose name also has popped up frequently in trade rumors, saw  a possible omen in Devereaux's inaction Friday.  </P> <P> "Usually they don't play a guy against the team he's going to be traded to,"  Stubbs said. "Hey, I was just happy to get the at-bats."  </P> <P> Stubbs played right field and first base and had two of the Dodgers' six hits,  a double and single.  </P> <P> Incidentally, Morgan did not pitch, either.  </P> <P> Fernando Valenzuela was all smiles when he came off the field after his second  spring start, in which he went three innings and gave up a run on three hits  and three walks.  </P> <P> "He was staying on top of the ball much better," said catcher Rick Dempsey,  alluding to the way Valenzuela was wild high in his first start, when he walked  four. "He was just off the corners, but he was keeping it down. He threw some  real good screwballs and his fastball was much better."  </P> <P> Manager Tom Lasorda also took a positive line in assessing Valenzuela.  </P> <P> "All I want him to say to me is that he isn't hurting," Lasorda said.  </P> <P> "If he tells me his arm isn't hurt, that's what I'm happy about."  </P> <P> Eddie Murray returned to the place where he had trained for the last 12 years,  but he was hardly sentimental about the journey.  </P> <P> "Was it hard?" said the longtime Oriole. "Just people here to say hi to, that's  all."  </P> <P> Murray did, however, treat his teammates to a giant order of catfish  sandwiches.  </P> <P> "Did Frank (Robinson, the Oriole manager) say he missed you?" Lasorda  mischievously called out to Murray.  </P> <P> Murray rolled his eyes.  </P> <P> "I don't think those words came out of his mouth."  </P> <P> Murray made no secret of his wish to leave Baltimore last winter, which is why  he thought someone was joking when the Orioles announced plans to retire his  number.  </P> <P> And what did he think of the gesture, once he learned it was on the level?  </P> <P> "It's something that I don't think about," he said.  </P> <P> Second baseman Mariano Duncan, the first batter in the game, was struck on the  left hand with a pitch by Baltimore pitcher Curt Schilling and left the game.  The Dodgers planned to take X-rays today in Vero Beach, but for the time being  they are calling the injury a bruise.  </P> <P> "I think it's OK," said Duncan, fighting to win a utility position on the team.  "I can feel my fingers and close my hand."  </P></p>

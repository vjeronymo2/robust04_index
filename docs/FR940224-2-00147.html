			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Labor-management human resource development in the U.S. telecommunications, automobile, construction and steel industries provides practical models for the situation in Brazil. The following case studies are suggested as sources: The AT&amp;T/CWA Alliance project; the pioneering work of the UAW and the automobile industry; and the entry level programs of the construction industry in tandem with the building trades organizations of the AFL&hyph;CIO. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The research of former Labor Secretary Ray Marshall and Dr. Barry Bluestone could also be consulted, in addition to more recent efforts by U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich. Other sources include labor studies centers such as those at George Washington University and the University of the District of Columbia; the AIFLD education program at the George Meany Center for Labor Studies; the AFL&hyph;CIO's Human Resource Institute; the National Association of Manufacturers; and the Conference Board. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Models used to illustrate effective labor-management-government relations must include those involving currently-employed individuals, the chronically unemployed, and new entrants into the labor pool. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The decisive and expanding role of labor-management cooperation should be emphasized as a key element in meeting the competitive challenges of the global economy. The program should also emphasize the coordination between human resource development delivery methods and the constant change that occurs in business and industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Selection of Participants <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Participants must be policymakers who can influence changes in Brazil, not management experts and professionals. Participants will be selected by the grantee, or its local co-sponsoring organization, in consultation with USIS posts. This two-way support will ensure effective discussion of new models for cooperation and innovation; these models should encourage more participation between labor and management, supporting Brazil's effort to secure more private sector initiative resulting in a more competitive market economy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This project will be executed by a U.S. not-for-profit institution that, through its proposal, illustrates extensive experience and success in coordinating international exchange programs. U.S. organizations with established working relationships with counterpart institutions in Brazil will receive priority under this competition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At the conclusion of the exchange, the grantee will conduct participant evaluations and submit a final report to USIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Funding <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Competition for USIA funding support is intense. Selection of a grantee institution is based on the substantive nature of the program proposal; the applicant's professional capability to carry the program through to successful conclusion; the cost effectiveness such as in-kind contributions and the ability to keep overhead costs at a minimum. USIA can devote up to $175,000 for this project; however, organizations with fewer than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000, and their budget submission should correspond to this limitation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All proposals should demonstrate in-depth, substantive knowledge of the relevant issues, established connections with partner institutions, and the capacity to organize and conduct the program. Organizational abilities include: appropriate orientation activities for the participants; detailed work plan for all phases of the project; tentative agendas for study tours, workshops, and internships; letters of commitment from internship hosts; and selection procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

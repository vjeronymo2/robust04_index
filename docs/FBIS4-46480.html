			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Capt 1st Rank K. Maklov, nuclear-powered </F> submarine commander, by Capt 1st Rank B. Tyurin: "Is the Ship  Ready for Patrol?"]    [Text] Strange as it may seem,  although the number of combat patrols sailed by ships of the  Russian Navy had decreased dramatically, patrol service has not  only become more intensive for the crews, but most importantly,  it has become harder. The reasons for this were explained to me  at the headquarters of one of the nuclear-powered submarine  formations of the Pacific Fleet. The truth is that because  hundreds of ships of the fleets, including several dozen  nuclear-powered submarines, were retired in recent years, and  because of the insufficiency of repair support to the few  survivors needing repairs, the numbers of which are constantly  growing, we are forced to make more active use of ships that are  technically serviceable, and use their life right up to the  limit. After all, the country hasn't relieved Black Sea Fleet  submariners of their mission of "keeping their powder dry," or  all the more so the strategic nuclear forces of their mission  guaranteeing stability in the world. This is why we saw several  different submarines being prepared simultaneously for combat  service at the Far Eastern submarine base we visited in fall of  1993.    One of them is under the command of Captain 1st Rank K.  Maklov. He is an experienced submariner who spent his entire  career under water, and he has commanded this particular crew  for over two years. Our short interview (the ship was being made  ready to set out to sea) occurred in the control room. The main  thing I wanted to clarify was this: Did the commander feel his  ship to be fully ready for patrol? Konstantin Gennadyevich said  the following.    There were more than enough problems before, but now they've  become extremely worrisome. They concern both people and  equipment. The thing I'm most concerned about as a commander is  the youthfulness and, consequently, the lack of experience of  the crew. And although it is 78 percent manned by "our own"  people and only 22 percent manned by men "commandeered" from  other submarines of the same class, which isn't bad by today's  yardsticks, hardly any of them underwent training at a special  training center. Before, such training was carried out a minimum  of twice a year, but now that this center is on the territory of  another state, and is being disbanded, the training has not been  conducted for several years. As for when a new center will be  ready, no one knows. At the old center, the crews underwent  training for almost two months, purposefully and continuously,  which did a great deal to raise the level of knowledge and  training of all categories of personnel, and which improved  operation and ensured accident-free use of the ship's weapons  and equipment. The one saving grace is that there are  experienced officers and warrant officers in the crew who have  participated in many cruises. But today they are doing  everything they can to get posted ashore, or even to demobilize.  Consequently, what we have basically are young officers (with  ranks of senior lieutenant and captain-lieutenant); moreover  four are last year's graduates and nine are this year's. Who is  going to teach them, and transmit experience to them? The older  comrades of course, who had undergone the normal course of  training. But aboard our submarine such officers are few and far  between.    Yes, today neither department commanders nor service chiefs  are interested in further service aboard ship. It has become  much more difficult to serve here, mainly because experienced  warrant officers are leaving, and the young replacements exhibit  an increasingly lower level of both general educational and  special training, and most importantly, a progressive  indifference towards service. Thus, while in former times  officers of our formation had to compete for appointments to  higher positions, today such competition simply no longer  exists, because officers are not aspiring for career  advancement. For example, quite recently there was only one  applicant in the entire formation for a vacant gunnery  department commander's position of a ship just like this one.  And so, before setting out to sea or on combat patrol, we are  forced to beef up each other's crews with more-experienced  submariners. And those who are required to serve on other than  their own ship do so reluctantly. As a result, all of this leads  to shortcomings in servicing the equipment, and even to its  breakdown.    In turn, the equipment is also aging. We can fulfill only up  to 70 percent of the required volume of restoration work through  our own efforts. When it comes to drydock inspection of the hull  and systems, plant workers have recently been doing this work in  the so-called "limited" variant. Consequently, we find the  condition of the ship's personal conveniences something to be  concerned about today, even on the eve of setting out to sea. We  are witnesses to the change that has occurred in the attitude of  the leadership of our local naval ship repair plant to fleet  orders. Today it is much more concerned with "hard currency"  repairs, while submarines, and particularly their dry-docking,  have been relegated to secondary importance.    It is no longer a secret to anyone that the problems that  have accumulated in maintaining the technical combat readiness  of ships, especially missile-carrying submarines, are reaching a  critical point. Certain routine maintenance operations are not  being carried out at all today on some of our special equipment.  Such work is within the means and abilities only of special  production personnel representing the manufacturing  organizations and enterprises, which had previously been fully  responsible for the promptness and quality of such work on items  of equipment, weapons or apparatus of their own manufacture.  Only these specialists, and not ship personnel, are permitted to  carry out such work, or all the more so to repair the products  of these enterprises. Now that economic ties have been broken,  and especially now that a sizable number of such enterprises  have found themselves outside Russia, this problem is screaming  out to be solved.    We should add to all of this the "interruptions," to put it  mildly, in the supply of technical and boatswain's equipment,  spare parts and accessories, and POL. As for what all of this  leads to, let me explain using our submarine as an example. When  we go out on patrol, we do so without the volume of spare parts,  tools and accessories specified by the norms. The appropriate  services explain to us that the sets of spare parts and tools  are unavailable at the storage depots because they are not being  replenished, even though orders for deliveries are submitted  regularly. Things are also very poor in regard to the supply of  special tools. We were just recently able to more or less  replenish what we needed, though it took a great deal of effort.  Even so, we had to borrow from neighboring ships, which means we  left them completely "naked." And special tools aren't the worst  of it--it's now been 4 months that we haven't received any  cleaning cloths or industrial-grade alcohol. Scarce grades of  fuel and lubricants are issued only for combat patrols. We found  the freon we need for the fire extinguishing system with  difficulty. I can go on with this list for a long time yet, but  let me talk just a little bit about food.    They won't of course allow us to go to sea hungry. However,  certain products are regularly substituted today on the basis of  a hard-to-understand system of calorie content. In addition, in  the past we used to receive a lot of preprocessed food. It has  now practically disappeared. Not only does the quality of food  preparation in the specific conditions of a submarine suffer in  this case, but also the galley equipment, which is not adapted  to processing such food products, is overworked, and people have  to be pulled off their watches for this work as well. One  problem raises another. The new assortment of food products  comes in packaging that does not meet the norms of storage and  use aboard a submarine. The abundance of glass compels us to  break up all of these jars before dumping them overboard, and I  need not explain how inconvenient and bad this is under the  conditions of a submarine.    And one final thing. As we talk, the ship is being prepared  to go to sea, but there are only 20 percent of the authorized  number of officers aboard, and around 25 seamen and petty  officers are absent. Rather than doing work aboard ship and  preparing their materiel, they are dealing with problems in  various shore-based services. When a ship is at its base, the  personnel are generally taken away from their planned lessons  and combat training measures on a continual basis. Sometimes 70  percent of the crew is taken away from its duties in this way.  This is associated mostly with the present system under which  the submariners have to see to crew life support on their own.  But various all-hands jobs, many off-ship details, and other  measures are frequent as well.    All of this doubtlessly has to have a negative effect on the  quality of the professional training of all categories of the  crew. Besides others, there is this criterion that graphically  characterizes the decline in the level of professionalism: While  literally just 2 years ago there were almost three dozen masters  of military affairs aboard ship, and our crew was the  formation's leader in this, now there are only three or four  persons. Presence of a large number of top-class specialists  even allowed us to carry out some renovation and auxiliary work  aboard the submarine by our own efforts. Now this is no longer  possible. In addition after we return from sea, another four of  the best-trained specialists will probably be leaving the crew.  And what's going to happen when the last master of military  affairs leaves? Unfortunately, we can't see even the semblance  of an effort to rectify the situation. Could it be that  something is being done, but the results haven't made themselves  known at our level yet?    We will be leaving for sea this week, and we will  doubtlessly  apply all of our strength in order to complete the missions of  alert duty. I need not say anything about their importance and  complexity. I feel that we will be capable of fulfilling our  patrol successfully. But do I feel some anxiety? Certainly. I  don't know a single person, and all the more so a commander, who  has ever set off for a cruise of any length who wasn't troubled  deep within his soul: Will everything fall into place, and will  he be able to successfully overcome all difficulties and  surprises that seamen, and especially submariners, encounter at  sea? Worries about family left behind on shore also intensify  such anxiety today. Even with our support, things aren't easy  for them, and how are they going to deal with the everyday  problems in our absence?    Still, it is our hope that when we return, we will be met by  changes for the better, slight though they may be.    COPYRIGHT: "Morskoy sbornik", 1994.</p>

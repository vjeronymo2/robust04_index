			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Mulheren Pleads Innocent: Former Wall Street trader John A. Mulheren Jr.  pleaded innocent to charges that he assisted the securities fraud schemes of  Ivan F. Boesky, the jailed stock speculator he is accused of plotting to kill.  Mulheren, 39, of Rumson, N.J., was arraigned before a federal magistrate in  Manhattan on a 42-count indictment handed down last week. Mulheren was charged  with manipulating the price of Gulf &amp; Western Inc. common stock at Boesky's  request and arranging a series of sham stock transactions to help Boesky  companies evade taxes and circumvent securities laws. Gulf &amp; Western has  since changed its name to Paramount Communications Inc. Last month, Mulheren  pleaded innocent in New Jersey to state weapons possession charges in  connection with an alleged plot on Boesky's life.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Closing Address" by Yang Hyong-sop, chairman of the </F> Supreme People's Assembly, SPA, at the conclusion of the seventh  session of the Ninth SPA at Mansudae Assembly Hall in Pyongyang  on 8 April -- recorded]    [Text] Comrade deputies:    The seventh session of the Ninth Supreme People's Assembly  [SPA] held amid the great interest of all people across the  country concludes its work after successfully discussing the  items on the agenda with the active participation of comrade  deputies.    The current SPA session discussed the issue on successfully  fulfilling the tasks of socialist economic construction in the  period of adjustment set forth by the Workers Party of Korea  [WPK] and adopted appropriate decisions. It also summed up the  execution of last year's state budget and deliberated and  decided on this year's state budget.    The current SPA session also deliberated and approved the  Law  on Protecting Cultural Relics, the Law on Lawyers, and the  revised and replenished Joint-Venture Law adopted by the SPA  Standing Committee during the recess of the SPA.    The discussions on the issue on successfully fulfilling the  tasks of socialist economic construction in the period of  adjustment set forth by the WPK as the SPA primary agenda item  and the adoption of appropriate decisions will further encourage  the revolutionary zeal of our people who are accelerating the  general onward march to create a new upsurge in the revolution  and construction, upholding the wise leadership of the party and  the leader, and will serve as an important momentum in  vigorously organizing and mobilizing them to implement the  imminent economic tasks in the period of adjustment. [applause]    In the current SPA session, the State Administration Council  [SAC] gave the great leader its pledge of loyalty to implement  the party's revolutionary economic strategies. Also,  responsible functionaries in charge of major fronts in the  period of adjustment and deputies of sectors concerned made a  firm resolution to fulfill their heavy and honorable tasks  without fail. This will further enhance the responsibility and  role of administrative and economic organizations, including the  SAC, and of functionaries in national economic activities and  will effect a great change in our people's worthwhile struggle  to fulfill the imminent economic tasks in the period of  adjustment. [applause]    The 1994 state budget adopted at the current SPA session is  a  concrete budget based on the solid socialist independent  economic foundation that ensures finance required for fulfilling  the tasks of socialist economic construction in the first year  of the adjustment period set forth by the WPK with our own  financial resources. It is also a dynamic and people-oriented  budget that is correctly formulated so as to elevate the  people's material and cultural living standard, to strengthen  the country's might, and to further advance the superiority of  the popular masses-oriented socialism of our own style.  [applause]    By deliberating and approving the Law on Protecting Cultural  Relics, the Law on Lawyers, and the Joint Venture Law adopted by  the SPA Standing Committee during the recess of the SPA, the  current SPA session has provided a firm legal guarantee for well  protecting, properly managing, and correctly inheriting and  developing our nation's excellent cultural legacy through the  embodiment of our party's chuche-based policy on the nation's  cultural legacy, for displaying the superiority of the legal  system in socialism of our own style, and for defending and  ensuring the country's economic and technological development  and its economic interests. [applause]    The whole course of the current SPA session's successful  discussions on the agenda items clearly demonstrated the  superiority and vitality of our country's socialist system,  which has been further consolidated and developed as days go by,  and under which the imperialists' and reactionaries'  antirepublic maneuvers becoming more vicious have been smashed  sternly under the wise leadership of the WPK headed by the great  leader Comrade Kim Il-song. It also vigorously demonstrated our  people's firm faith and invincible will to resolutely protect,  defend, and brilliantly consummate the chuche socialist cause to  the end with the might of single-hearted unity around the party  and the leader. [applause]    I now declare the closing of the seventh session of the  Ninth  SPA, expressing my firm belief that all comrade deputies will  excellently repay the party's great confidence and expectations  with their successful fulfillment of economic tasks assigned to  each sector and unit for the adjustment period, at the front of  the masses by greatly displaying the revolutionary spirit of  self- reliance and fortitude, upholding the leadership of the  party and the leader.</p>

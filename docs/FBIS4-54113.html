			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 24 (YONHAP) -- South Korea and Canada  have agreed to work out concrete action programs to further  strengthen bilateral cooperative relations in the area of  economy, the Foreign Ministry reported Tuesday. A ministry  official said the agreement was reached at the first joint task  team meeting of the "Korea- Canada special partnership  relations" held on Monday.    At the meeting, delegates decided to map out concrete and  tangible programs to better facilitate improved market approach,  industrial cooperation and joint advancement to third countries  with a view to helping form special partnership relations  between the two countries.    They also agreed to explore multi-pronged ways to ensure  closer mutual cooperation at such multilateral organizations as  the World Trade Organization (WTO), Organization for Economic  Cooperation and Development (OECD) and Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC).    During the meeting, Canada suggested Korea's tie-up with the  North America Free Trade Area (NAFTA) or the conclusion of a  Korea-Canada free trade agreement. But, Korean delegates  expressed the view that this is no stage to review such matters  under the present circumstance.    Creation of the "Korea-Canada special partnership relations"  was agreed on during the Korea-Canada summit held in Seattle  last November during the APEC summit meeting.    After another round of talks in Canada next month, the task  team will prepare a joint report by the end of next month for  final adoption before the next APEC ministerial conference in  November.    At the meeting, Korea was represented by Second Assistant  Foreign Minister Sun Chon-yong and Canada by Barry Carim,  assistnat minister of foreign affairs and trade.</p>

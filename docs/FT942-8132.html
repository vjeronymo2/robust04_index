			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The culinary melting pot that makes Malta special - Cookery / There is plenty to satisfy every taste, but Philippa Davenport finds that fish remains the country's outstanding food item Malta was fated to be a culinary melting pot. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Byzantines, Arabs, Normans, Castillians, Knights of St John, French and British - all have been there and left their mark. The blood orange season had just finished when I arrived so I was denied a taste of sauce Maltaise, the only recipe of international repute, so far as I know, that carries the name of Malta in its title. Loquats, on the other hand, were just coming on stream, heaped in apricot-coloured piles on market stalls at Birkirkara, half way between Valetta and the medieval city of Medina. The market fills the streets that flank the cathedral square with a haphazard mix of fresh fish, flowers, clothes, toys, dairy produce, live rabbits and chickens, fruits and vegetables, pots and pans. There was surplus garden produce and foods from the wild: bunches of mint (a Maltese favourite) and savory, home-pickled olives, and the first of the new season's capers. The impressive spread of fishy offerings included one barrow selling nothing but octopus. Orderly queues waited patiently to be served by stallholders proudly displaying young globe artichokes bunched as prettily as flowers; milky white-toothed young garlic complete with flowing green leaves; and firm yellow potatoes piled as neatly as dry stone walls. Other vendors, placing their scales on the ground amid an untidy sprawl of bulging vegetable sacks, elicited bargain basement tactics from excited customers. I shall also remember Birkirkara for its baked goods. I recall the dexterous speed of a pie-man shaping and filling pastizzi - savoury puff pastry confections eaten fresh from the oven as anytime snacks. I downed one version filled with ricotta and another made with peas and spices. Mincemeat is for city folk, the pie-man told me. Spinach and anchovy is reserved for Good Friday. Many bakers still use proper brick-lined, wood-fired bread ovens, and housewives still bring meals to be cooked in them after the freshly-baked loaves emerge. On Gozo, an island just 15 minutes by helicopter from Malta, wild flowers grow in even greater profusion and huge, feathery plumes of wild fennel stand sentinel along most pathways and roads. Fennel seeds are saved for cooking with potatoes but, curiously, no one I met seemed to know about using the previous year's dried stems as fragrant fuel for grilling and barbecueing. Gozo is home to Malta's salt pans, quite small, carved to fit the contours of the rocks and twinkling like glassy mosaics when you look down on them. Gozo is also the home of gbejniets, miniature ewe or goats' milk cheeses which have a lovely junket-like texture when very fresh. The Maltese like them best when mature, marinated briefly in vinegar and/or coated heavily with black pepper. The cheese-maker I met had 70 ewes and I watched her ladle the freshly-set curds into plastic moulds that looked like shuttlecocks. At lunch time, I tasted the product at a bar and restaurant in a sleepy square in Xaghra. There, we tucked into good bread and a soup called kusksu. This consists of broad beans and tiny pasta balls in a broth sweetened with a smidgin of tomato; slices of cool, junket-fresh gbejniet are added at the point of serving. The substantial soup was followed by a choice of two other traditional Maltese dishes: rabbit cooked with garlic and ross fil forn, a dish of baked rice with eggs, cheese and meat sauce said to have originated with the Phoenicians. Soups are good news in Malta. I was very taken by widow's soup, a clear broth laced with vegetables and finished with slices of gbejniet (and a boiled egg, perhaps) for extra nutrition. This is particularly tasty when made not with worthy winter roots but with fresh peas, young carrots, lettuce and sprigs of mint. Fish, though, is Malta's outstanding food item. At one fish restaurant in St Julians, a pretty bay zinging with holiday spirit, we dined on fish with fennel potatoes, for which I give the recipe below. This was preceded by hobz biz-zejt, which can be a simple bite or substantial enough to be a nicoise-type sandwich lunch in its own right. The restaurant's version seemed to be hobz biz-zejt crossed with bruschetta and I liked it all the more for that - thickly-sliced country bread, toasted lightly, soused with olive oil, sprinkled with skinned and finely-chopped tomatoes, seasoned, and cut into bite-size pieces. The availability of good bread, good oil and good tomatoes are, of course, essential to its success. Just beyond the charming fishing village of Marsaxlokk, on Malta's south east coast, lies a government fish farm and research station. Here breeding, hatching, nursery and fattening units are all housed inside an old fort, while floating cages tethered offshore are home to the young adult fish. Sea bream and sea bass are the main subjects of research. BAKED FISH WITH FENNEL POTATOES (serves 6) At the restaurant in St Julians, this was made with dentex, a member of the bream family I have been unable to buy in the UK. Grey mullet, providing it is veryfresh, works well. Ask your fishmonger to fillet it and take home the bits to make a few spoonfuls of well-flavoured stock. The oven must be very hot indeed. Start heating it up well in advance and heat a baking sheet, too. Ingredients: 1 fine fresh grey mullet weighing 3 to 3 1/2 lb, filleted; 2lb firm potatoes (I suggest large Jersey Royals);  1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds; several sprigs each of thyme and rosemary; the finely-grated zest of a lemon and a good squeeze of lemon juice; 1 small onion; 1 garlic clove; 4 or 5 tablespoons of fish stock; extra virgin olive oil. Method: Chop the onion and garlic finely and soften them in 3-4 tablespoons of olive oil. Slice the potatoes thickly and parboil for five minutes. Pound the fennel, rosemary and thyme with mortar and pestle. Toss the drained potatoes with the onion and season with salt, pepper, most of the lemon zest and most of the herb mixture. Toss again. Oil a gratin or baking dish as large as a roasting pan but suitable for bringing to table. Pour the fish stock into it and season with lemon juice. Add the potatoes. Make nest-like hollows among the potatoes and lay the fish fillets in them, seasoned with salt, pepper and the rest of the lemon zest and herbs. Half-fold the fillets and lay them skin side down. Drizzle olive oil over the fish and give the potatoes a final annointing. Slide the dish on to the hot baking sheet and bake at 450'F/250'C (gas mark 8) for about 20 minutes.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> SOPHOMORE ROOKS SPARKS ARIZONA PAST MICHIGAN  </P> <P> GAME OF THE DAY  </P> <P> Sixth-ranked Arizona surprised defending NCAA champion Michigan both at the  start and at the finish in the 11th annual Hall of Fame Tip-Off game Saturday  at Springfield, Mass.  </P> <P> The young Wildcats attacked fourth-ranked Michigan's big players and the  strategy worked in a season-opening 82-75 victory.  </P> <P> Sean Rooks, a 6-foot-11 sophomore from Fontana High, scored 20 points,  including six consecutive free throws down the stretch, as the Wildcats  outscored the Wolverines, 16-7, in the final 1:30.  </P> <P> Arizona had its largest lead, 54-45, early in the second half, but Michigan  went ahead, 66-63, on a three-point shot by Rumeal Robinson and a free throw by  Terry Mills with eight minutes left.  </P> <P> Matt Muehlbach then tied the score with a three-point basket. Michigan regained  the lead briefly, 68-66, but Brian Williams, a sophomore transfer from  Maryland, triggered the decisive charge by Arizona.  </P> <P> Williams, who had 12 points in limited action while recovering from a foot  injury, tied the score, 68-68, with two free throws. Jud Buechler followed with  a layup and Matt Othick had two more free throws for a 72-68 lead.  </P> <P> Rooks added his six free throws and Muehlbach had two as the Wildcats spoiled  the regular-season debut of Michigan Coach Steve Fisher, who took over after  Bill Frieder resigned just before the NCAA tournament last season.  </P> <P> Robinson led all scorers with 27 points. Mills had 16 before fouling out with  5:30 remaining.  </P> <P> OTHER TOP 25 TEAMS  </P> <P> 7. North Carolina 78  </P> <P> Villanova 68  </P> <P> Rick Fox scored 23 points, including the three-pointer that gave North Carolina  the lead for good, and the seventh-ranked Tar Heels won in the semifinals of  the Maui tournament at Lahaina, Hawaii.  </P> <P> The Tar Heels needed a miraculous last-minute comeback to beat James Madison in  the opening round as the Dukes missed three free throws down the stretch. In  the same situation on Saturday, North Carolina (2-0) fared better at the foul  line and went on to beat the Wildcats (1-1).  </P> <P> Fox's three-pointer with 5:53 left gave North Carolina a 67-65 lead and when  Villanova went cold from the field, the Tar Heels were just successful enough  at the foul line, making five of eight, in the final 1:07, to get the win.  </P> <P> Hubert Davis finished with 16 points for the Tar Heels. Freshman Aaron Bain led  Villanova with 17 points.  </P> <P> 10. Duke 130  </P> <P> Harvard 54  </P> <P> Senior Robert Brickey and freshman Billy McCaffrey each scored 22 points to  lead seven players in double figures at Durham, N.C.  </P> <P> The final score represented the biggest lead on a night when Coach Mike  Krzyzewski had cleared his bench with four minutes left in the first half. When  reserve Joe Cook scored with 6:16 left to play, he gave Duke a 113-46 lead and  was the last of the 12 Blue Devil players to score. No one for Duke had less  than four points in its official season opener.  </P> <P> Phil Henderson scored 12 points, with Christian Laettner, Alaa Abdelnaby and  Thomas Hill scoring 11 each and Brian Davis getting 10 for the Blue Devils.  </P> <P> Ralph James scored 13 for Harvard and Tchad Robinson had 12.  </P> <P> 11. Missouri 82  </P> <P> 12. Louisville 79  </P> <P> The Tigers scored only three points in the final 8:03 but withstood a rally by  the Cardinals in the semifinals of the Maui tournament.  </P> <P> The 11th-ranked Tigers led, 79-57, with 8:03 to play. But Louisville, led by  Felton Spencer and Jerome Harmon, staged an amazing comeback, getting to within  80-79 with 51 seconds left.  </P> <P> Missouri then ran down the 45-second shot clock and Anthony Peeler scored the  game's final points with 23 seconds left when Spencer was called for  goaltending on his driving layup.  </P> <P> Louisville worked for a final shot, but a three-point attempt by Everick  Sullivan with five seconds left bounced off the rim and the Tigers had the  rebound and the victory.  </P> <P> The Tigers (2-0) will meet No. 7 North Carolina, which beat Villanova, 78-68,  in the other semifinal, in tonight's championship game.  </P> <P> Peeler added 17 points for Missouri and Lee Coward had 15.  </P> <P> Spencer had 28 points and Harmon finished with 20.  </P> <P> 14. Indiana 77  </P> <P> Miami (Ohio) 66  </P> <P> Calbert Cheaney, one of Indiana's seven freshmen, had six of his 20 points in a  decisive second-half streak as the 14th-ranked Hoosiers won their season opener  at Bloomington, Ind.  </P> <P> Miami cut Indiana's lead to 54-51 with 10:51 to play, but Cheaney's basket with  10:31 remaining ignited a 12-2 run.  </P> <P> A dunk by freshman Lawrence Funderburke put Indiana ahead 58-51 with 9:17  remaining. After two free throws by Miami's David Scott, the Hoosiers scored  eight consecutive points on a 10-foot shot by freshman Greg Graham, two jump  shots by Chaney and a basket by Eric Anderson.  </P> <P> Anderson finished with 19 points and Funderburke added 10 as Indiana beat Miami  for the 20th time in 23 meetings.  </P> <P> 20. Minnesota 64  </P> <P> Cincinnati 66  </P> <P> Steve Sanders took an inbound pass from Andre Tate and made a three-point shot  with one second remaining to give the Bearcats the upset win.  </P> <P> Minnesota led, 64-63, when Cincinnati took the ball with 26 seconds remaining.  Gophers guard Kevin Lynch stole the ball, and began dribbling out the remaining  time, but then threw the ball away, giving the Bearcats one last chance.  </P> <P> Tate led all scorers with 18 points, while Lynch led the Gophers with 16.  </P> <P> 24. Memphis State 91  </P> <P> Tennessee 72  </P> <P> Elliot Perry scored 23 points and came up with nine steals as the Tigers raced  past the Volunteers in the Mid-South tournament at Memphis.  </P> <P> The Tigers shot only 32% from the floor in the first half and 41% for the game,  but used a tough defense to stop Tennessee.  </P> <P> Memphis State caused 39 Tennessee turnovers and allowed the Volunteers to shoot  only 40% from the floor.  </P> <P> Memphis State (2-0) beat Tennessee (1-1) for the first time in three games.  </P> <P> The Tigers lost a 35-31 halftime lead at the start of the second half when the  Volunteers pulled even, 39-39, on an inside shot by Ian Lockhart.  </P> <P> Memphis State then went on a 10-0 run capped by back-to-back three-point plays  by Perry and Ben Spiva that left the Tigers ahead, 49-39, with 14:57 remaining.  </P> <P> Tennessee pulled to within 51-44 with 13:14 left on a jump shot by Greg Bell,  but consecutive steals and layups by Perry put the Tigers ahead, 55-44, with  12:17 left.  </P> <P> Cheyenne Gibson followed Perry for Memphis State with 15 points and Ernest  Smith, who grabbed nine rebounds, added 11.  </P> <P> Lockhart led Tennessee with 24 points and a game-high 13 rebounds, and Greg  Bell added 16 points.  </P> <P> OTHER TOURNAMENTS  </P> <P> ALASKA SHOOTOUT  </P> <P> AT ANCHORAGE  </P> <P> Kansas St. 79, Hawaii 76 -- Steve Henson scored 18 points in the second half to  lead the Wildcats into the championship game against Michigan State.  </P> <P> Hawaii's Chris Gaines scored 19 points in the first half as the Rainbows led by  as many as 15.  </P> <P> But Kansas State, using several substitutes to take turns guarding Gaines, held  him scoreless for nearly six minutes in the second half.

It was his only basket in the second half.  </P> <P> Connecticut 95, Auburn 81 -- Rod Sellers scored 19 points and four other  Huskies were in double figures to spark the Huskies in the consolation round.  </P> <P> The game was close for only the first three minutes.

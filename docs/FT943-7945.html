			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): New inflation threat takes Dow lower Wall Street US stocks suffered a sharp setback yesterday as bonds retreated on fresh signs of inflation, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 21.05 lower at 3,755.43 after takeover speculation and Wall Street reratings had buffeted many individual stocks. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.00 to 463.17. Volume on the Big Board came to 293.7m shares, with declining issues outpacing rises by 1,287 to 346. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was off 1.39 at 443.55 and the Nasdaq composite 0.49 easier at 742.17. From the opening, the optimism inspired by the Federal Reserve earlier in the week showed further signs of erosion. Equities receded for a second day as investors focused on the latest turn taken by the volatile bond market. Although the Fed's decision to lift short-term interest rates was supposed to have cleared the way for a sustained upturn, Treasury bonds tumbled again on the news of mounting inflationary pressures. The catalyst was the monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which offered evidence that manufacturers were passing along the higher cost of raw materials to customers. During the morning equities suffered only modest losses. But bonds ploughed deeper into negative ground and stocks were pulled down to near their session's lows in the late afternoon. Among the Dow industrials, International Business Machines and Coca-Cola were two bright spots. IBM gained Dollars 1 3/8 at Dollars 66 1/4 after Merrill Lynch raised its 1994 earnings and revenue projections. Coca-Cola climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 47 5/8 a day after it emerged that Mr Warren Buffett had increased his stake in the company. Offsetting those gains, Caterpillar was down Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 108 and General Motors shed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 49 7/8 . Ford lost Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 29 1/2 and Chrysler fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 47 1/4 . Deere gave back Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 66 7/8 after rising Dollars 2 1/2 in the previous session. But Navistar put on Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 14 7/8 as the truck and engine manufacturer posted improved third-quarter profits and raised its projections of North American demand for heavy-duty trucks this year. Joy Technologies, which makes coal mining machinery, advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 11 7/8 after agreeing to be acquired by Harnischfeger, a rival supplier. News of the deal sent Harnischfeger's share price Dollars 1 1/4 lower to Dollars 22 1/8 . Quaker Oats achieved a 52-week high of Dollars 82 1/8 after jumping Dollars 6, or 8 per cent. Investors were betting that a takeover was imminent. Two other cereal makers also rang up big gains. Kellogg was Dollars 2 1/8 ahead at Dollars 56 5/8 and General Mills added Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 55 3/8 . In pharmaceuticals, Schering-Plough gave back Dollars 1 3/8 to finish at Dollars 69 1/2 . Salomon Brothers said takeover speculation this month had made the issue too expensive. Instead, excitement over the industry's consolidation shifted to Mylan Laboratories, a generic drugs maker, boosting its share price Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 . The Nasdaq was held back by a Dollars 4 3/8 decline in Lotus Development's share price to Dollars 41 3/8 . The selling followed cautious comments by at least two Wall Street analysts. Canada Toronto shares lost ground as the US dollar weakened following Tuesday's interest rate increases. Traders said market participants had expected the US currency to rally after the rate rises, and were disappointed by its performance. The TSE 300 composite index declined 20.83 to 4,184.44, while falling issues outnumbered advances by 407 to 311 after volume of 57.0m shares valued at CDollars 681.9m. All but one of the 14 stock groups declined, led by transportation and real estate, which lost 1.83 and 1.63 per cent respectively. Consumer products fell 1.30 per cent. Mexico Equities fluctuated before finishing marginally easier in mixed, volatile trading ahead of the presidential election at the weekend. The IPC index of 37 leading shares closed 1.41 points off at 2,698.24 after moving within a 27-point range. Brazil Sao Paulo stocks were up 1.16 per cent at the close, but off the morning's highs, as a rally founded on positive political and economic expectations continued for the third straight session. The Bovespa index gained 576 at 50,266 in turnover of RDollars 486.5m (Dollars 543.6m).</p>

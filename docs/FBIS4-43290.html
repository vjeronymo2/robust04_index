			<p>BFN     [Text] Kirsehir, June 15 (A.A.) -- The 1,300 workers of the  Petlas tire factory launched a two-day hunger strike on Tuesday  [14 June], to protest the government's decision to close and  privatize their plant.    The ANATOLIAN Agency learned that the workers began their  action in front of the Petrol-Is trade union office and stated  that they were categorically against the closure of their plant.    `We are against the closure of the only national company  which manufactures aircraft tires and the only strategic  national company,' the workers said.    The government decision is in line with its April 5 economic  measures package.    Of the striking workers, eight will hold their strike in  capital Ankara as a symbolic gesture.    Confederation of Turkish Trade Unions (Turk-Is) treasurer  Enver Tocoglu said that it was possible to increase the capacity  of Petlas by 30 percent, by a 30,000-dollar investment.    He also recalled that the economic package led to the laying  off of 4,959 workers in the northwestern city of Bursa.    Petrol-Is trade union's leader Adnan Ozcan said that their  action will last three days in Ankara and two days in this  central Anatolian city of Kirsehir and no production will take  place in their plant during the strike.    `We are warning. You cannot close Petlas. If it is closed,  the hunger strike will become a death strike,' he said.    Ozcan said that they opposed the closure of their plant for  political reasons.</p>

			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / Victoria seeks to trim deficit THE CONSERVATIVE government of Victoria, Australia's second most populous state, yesterday announced 17,800 public sector redundancies in a tough economic statement designed to narrow the state's budget deficit. The redundancies, to be implemented by June, follow the loss of more than 14,000 public sector jobs since the conservative Liberal/National party defeated the former Labor government in October. Mr Alan Stockdale, state treasurer (finance minister), also announced a ADollars 247m (Pounds 121m) tax increase and spending cuts of ADollars 731m by June 1995, bringing total spending cuts since the election to ADollars 1.2bn. Mr Stockdale said the cost of the redundancies would raise the 1992-93 budget deficit to ADollars 2.454bn from ADollars 2.345bn, compared with ADollars 1.6bn last year. He said the budget would return to surplus in 1994-95. Mr Stockdale said harsh measures had been forced on the government by the financial profligacy of the former Labor government. 'I think people realise that there is no choice. If we defer dealing with the mess that the Labor party left behind, then in two or three years' time the spiral of debt that follows from the deficit will force us to make even bigger cuts,' Mr Stockdale said. Most cuts will fall on health, social and education services, in growing demand due to the sluggish economy and industrial restructuring.</p>

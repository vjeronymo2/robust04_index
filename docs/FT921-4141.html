			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / International Company News: Net income up at Dell Computer to Dollars 15.4m DELL Computer, the fast-growing US personal computer manufacturer, yesterday reported a 78 per cent rise in fourth-quarter net income, helped by a particularly strong increase in European sales. Dell has enjoyed remarkable growth over the past few years by selling IBM-compatible PCs direct to the customer, cutting out middle-men. But it faces increasingly tough competition in the US from rivals imitating its strategy. For the fourth quarter the company reported net income of Dollars 15.4m, or 62 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 285.7m, compared with income of Dollars 8.6m, or 42 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 167.3m in the fourth quarter of last year. For the full year it reported income of Dollars 50.9m on sales of Dollars 890m, compared with income of Dollars 27.2m on sales of Dollars 546m the previous year. Dell, which has been expanding rapidly in Europe, said international revenues in the fourth quarter roughly doubled to Dollars 119.4m, while domestic sales rose 56 per cent to Dollars 166.3m. Despite a drop in gross margins, due to price cutting, the company said net income as a percentage of sales rose from 5.2 to 5.4, due to a drop in operating expenses, tax benefits associated with production from the company's new plant in Ireland and strong management of working capital.</p>

Contrary to their competences  they had illegaly obeyed the orders of former ministers of the  interior in regard to the rules of defending the border.  Through their bad behaviours they have violated the personality  of man and have mistreated different persons who have tried to  cross the state borders and have walked the borders victims  before crowds of people.    In the summer of 1990, although communist dictatorship had  declared that border crossing was no longer considered treason,  hundreds of young boys and girls who attempted to cross the  border were killed. A total of 80-110 persons were killed  during 1989-1990, according to experts.    The trial of Engjel Thoma, former commander of the border  guards of Samrisht, Shkodra District was held on October 27,  1993. Six young Albanians were killed in 8 months' time in 1990  in the border center. Official figures on the murders of  Albanians are expected to be higher.    Various reports published in the Albanian press over the  last  three years show that senior officials of former state security  and former President Alia are responsible for these murders.</p>

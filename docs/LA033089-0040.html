			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A loan to rebuild a chemical plant has been approved after being delayed until  the plant's owner was cleared of suspicion that it knew of secret attempts to  ship a rocket fuel element from its plant to Iran. The $92-million loan for the  plant, vital to the nation's rocket fuel supply, was approved by the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration nearly a year after the plant blew up at  Henderson, Nev. The loan from a Seattle bank, to be repaid almost entirely by  federal taxpayers, is to Pacific Engineering &amp; Production Co. NASA and the  Defense Department have agreed to buy 140 million pounds of ammonium  perchlorate -- a rocket fuel oxidizer -- over seven years. The destroyed plant  is about 30% rebuilt but at a new location: Cedar City, Utah.  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA AIDE DENIES ARMY PLANNED A COUP;  </P> <P> EAST BLOC: CHIEF OF STAFF SAYS REVOLUTION WAS SPONTANEOUS BUT THAT DISCONTENT  HAD BEEN MOUNTING.  </P> <P> BUCHAREST, Romania -- The deputy defense minister denied Wednesday that the  army had been planning a coup against dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, but he said  there had been widespread discontent in the military before the revolution.  </P> <P> The official, Col. Gen. Vasili Ionel, who is also the army chief of staff,  dismissed reports that the defense minister, Nicolae Militaru, had said the  armed forces had been planning for six months to move against the Ceausescu  regime.  </P> <P> "I declare openly and firmly that Gen. Militaru did not make such a statement,"  Ionel said. "The revolution was spontaneous, but discontent had been piling up  for years and years, especially since Ceausescu had been leading the country as  a dictator.  </P> <P> "This discontent was experienced by every Romanian, civilian and military  alike. The army was discontented with its treatment by Ceausescu and with the  way it was used by Ceausescu as a labor force for huge projects of no value to  Romania."  </P> <P> But the army did nothing "to trigger off the revolution," he said, adding: "The  revolution was made by the people, and it broke out spontaneously. The army  supported the revolution from the first moment."  </P> <P> These statements from the army's top commander appeared to be aimed, at least  in part, at deflecting criticism that some Romanian military commanders were  slow to react to the revolution and delayed giving orders to the army to join  forces with the people in the streets until it was clear that Ceausescu had  been ousted.  </P> <P> Col. Gen. Ionel said the army commanders at Timisoara, in western Transylvania,  had been given orders to shoot at the demonstrators, whom Ceausescu referred to  as "hooligans."  </P> <P> "I declare now that the army did not shoot at the people," Ionel said. "On the  contrary, the army withdrew, erected some barricades and let the people pass.  But within the army, there were infiltrators from the state security forces,  and they were the ones who fired at the people. The dead of Timisoara were not  killed by army bullets."  </P> <P> The number of dead in Timisoara has not been determined, although the  government has said that as many as 3,500 or 4,000 may have died there. Some  journalists believe the death toll there is much lower. No mass graves have  been found that would support such a high death toll, but there have been  unconfirmed reports that some bodies were flown out of the region. The  provisional government has said the death toll for the entire country may be as  high as 7,000.  </P> <P> Ionel said the country was now fully under army control and that if any men of  the security forces, the Securitate, are still at large, they are not many,  were isolated and not able to fight. He dismissed rumors that a large force of  Securitate men were encamped somewhere in the Carpathian mountains, preparing  an attack.  </P> <P> "We know our country and our mountains very well," Ionel said, "and there is no  such force."  </P> <P> Still, he went on, "we continue to be very careful; we keep some targets under  military guard." Tanks are still drawn up on the lawn of the Foreign Ministry,  the new government's headquarters, and the families of leading figures of the  National Salvation Front and the interim government are guarded round the  clock.  </P> <P> Ionel also denied reports that an Iranian force had been sent to help  Ceausescu.  </P> <P> "Ceausescu had his own units of defense," he said. "They were trained for this  purpose."  </P> <P> These units, he said, "numbered in the thousands" and were better trained and  equipped than any other military units in the country.  </P> <P> "We suppose all this part of the presidential guard has been arrested," Ionel  said. "They no longer have weapons or the possibility to use them. They are all  being interrogated. The interrogations have not been finished, and it has not  been determined what punishment will be imposed on them. We want them to have  fair trials, and prosecutors will decide on what penalties to ask for,  depending on what the terrorists have done."  </P> <P> Ionel declined to say how many had been arrested, and he said he could not tell  how many of those arrested were civilian or military.  </P> <P> "Among the bodyguards and security guards, all are military-trained and some  have military ranks," he said. "But they were not dressed in military clothing.  They carried no identity, and we had no idea who they were or which force they  belonged to."  </P> <P> The National Salvation Front has called for its committees from across the  country to meet today in the capital. It will be the first gathering of the  regional leaders since the revolt.  </P> <P> An official said the talks may develop coordination between the capital and the  provinces.  </P></p>

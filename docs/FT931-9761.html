			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / International Company News: Compagnie Bancaire may cut back operations abroad COMPAGNIE Bancaire, the specialised financial business owned by Paribas, the French banking group, has warned that it may have to rationalise its international operations following a steep fall in net profits to FFr369m (Dollars 66m) last year, from FFr579m in 1991. The company, which has large interests in property finance in the UK, has been badly affected by the crisis in the UK property sector. Its UK interests plunged further into the red last year with a net loss of FFr811m, against FFr88m the previous year. Compagnie Bancaire fared better in France, where net profits for 1992 rose by 11 per cent to FFr1.34bn, mainly due to a strong performance from its credit and life insurance businesses. Mr Michel Francois-Henrot, chief executive, said Compagnie Bancaire planned to scrutinise all its foreign activities and would sell or close all those that did not perform. Banque Paribas, the French bank, has had its long-term credit rating placed under review for possible downgrade by Moody's, the international rating agency, adds Sara Webb in London. Moody's said the review affects about Dollars 690m of long-term debt. Banque Paribas' long-term debt is currently rated Aa2, while its short-term certificates of deposit - which are not under review - are rated Prime-1.</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Clarke proposes IMF gold sale to help poor nations: UK plan aims to boost economic reforms The International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold reserves to finance a plan to help poor countries, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor of the exchequer, will propose tomorrow. Mr Clarke will tell the Commonwealth countries' finance ministers at their meeting in Malta that his plan would benefit heavily indebted countries that are trying to reform their economies. His plan goes further than the so-called Trinidad terms, which were intended to reduce the burden of debts owed by poor countries to other governments. The new proposals would help those countries that owe large sums to international institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. Such debt is not covered by the Trinidad terms. Mr Clarke's suggestion that the IMF should sell part of its gold reserves to finance the scheme is likely to prove controversial. His plan would benefit indebted countries which are complying with IMF programmes for the 'structural adjustment' of their economies. The countries which Mr Clarke thinks are most likely to benefit include Guyana, Honduras, Kenya, Laos, Mozambique, Sierra Leone and Uganda. Mr Clarke will call for the IMF to increase its enhanced structural adjustment facility, which provides concessional loans to poor countries, and improve the terms on which such concessional loans are made. The World Bank would also extend its concessional lending programme. The aim would be to reduce interest payments on debt to a low level and extend the period required for repayment. The UK believes the IMF would need to sell less than 10 per cent of its gold reserves, currently worth about Dollars 40bn (Pounds 25.3bn), to finance the scheme. Sales would be spread out over several years and could be managed so as not to disrupt the gold market. Persuading the IMF to sell part of its gold might prove difficult, but the UK feels that too much of the fund's reserves are held in gold, which pays no income. The UK argues the proceeds from the gold sales could be reinvested in income-earning assets. The assets could still be held as reserves with the income from them devoted to the debt plan. Mr Clarke acknowledges that his plan could only be accepted after extensive negotiations. The Trinidad terms, first proposed in 1990 by Mr John Major, the prime minister, but then chancellor, are still not fully accepted by all countries concerned. Nevertheless, nearly Dollars 3bn of debts have been written off under the terms to date, with 22 countries having benefited. The new scheme would require approval by 85 per cent of IMF members, but would not involve a change in the fund's articles and thus would not require legislative action in member countries. Following the Commonwealth finance ministers' meeting, Mr Clarke will go straight to the IMF annual meeting in Madrid, where the UK and the US will be pressing for a special allocation of special drawing rights (the IMF's reserve currency) to help poorer nations.

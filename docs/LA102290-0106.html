			<p><P> October 22, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MCDONNELL DOUGLAS' SPACE UNIT IS EXPANDING;  </P> <P> AEROSPACE: THE HUNTINGTON BEACH-BASED SUBSIDIARY IS A BRIGHT SPOT FOR THE  RETRENCHING COMPANY. FUTURE GROWTH IS TIED TO THE SPACE STATION.  </P> <P> While other units of aerospace and defense giant McDonnell Douglas Corp. are  cutting back, McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. is growing.  </P> <P> Employment at the Huntington Beach-based space center division has increased  from about 1,600 to 1,900 this year, officials say. If Congress decides to go  all out in funding the space station Freedom, the unit could add up to 1,000  more workers at its Kennedy Space Center facility in the next three to five  years.  </P> <P> The optimistic employment report came Friday from Ken Francis, president of the  space systems division. He spoke at the dedication of an 82,000-square-foot,  $9-million building at the Kennedy Space Center facility.  </P> <P> "We're looking forward to real good growth in this area -- if Congress gets it  act together," Francis said.  </P> <P> The space systems unit is a bright spot for the St. Louis-based parent.  </P> <P> In July, the company announced plans to cut up to 11% of its 130,000-member  work force. It said declining aerospace business and dwindling government  contracts left it with no choice but to cut costs by $700 million.  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas has contracts to process payloads for the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration and the Defense Department. It also  launches commercial Delta rockets from Cape Canaveral and has other space  projects in Brevard County.  </P> <P> The space division's workload has picked up this year because employees work on  payloads months or even years ahead of scheduled launches.  </P> <P> As for the future, company officials are watching funding decisions on the  space station. A compromise between the House and Senate cut $600 million from  the station budget, leaving NASA with $1.9 billion for the project in the  fiscal year that started Oct. 1.  </P> <P> The economic health of space companies hinges on the space station budget, said  Bob Allen, executive director of the Space Coast Development Commission in  Titusville. The space station program would provide work for the space shuttle  for years.  </P> <P> "If the space station doesn't get funded, we're not going to be flying  shuttles," Allen said. "I believe that the space station is still a very viable  project."  </P></p>

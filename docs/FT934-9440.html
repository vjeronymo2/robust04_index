			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Austria (8): 'Three years of reforms' - Interview: Franz Vranitzk - The Austrian chancellor replies to questions put to him by Ian Rodger and Patrick Blum Q: The nationalised industries are in trouble again. Is there any chance that the government will bail them out again? A: I am not open for a bail-out in the old sense, as it was done in the sixties and seventies. We do not help those companies by covering their deficits and letting them return to business as usual. Q: Is it important to you that Austrians still hold majority control in these companies? A: It is understandable that the workers in these companies would feel safer if their shareholders were not foreigners. We have to make them understand that this is not the only consideration. There has to be more international co-operation to tap new technological know-how or new markets. And we sometimes have to offer the know-how developed here to others to open new market opportunities. Q: The government's deficit-reduction plan has been thrown off course by the recession. Will there be further relaxation in the forthcoming election year? A: I do not believe in a lot of election promises. Our standards of social security, our education system, our ecological standards are all so high that it is not politically necessary to increase them. Let us be glad of that. Probably we could not afford increases. Q: Your critics say that the present coalition government has been hesitant in implementing reforms. Should there be another coalition after next year's election? A: This government has brought more reforms in the past three years than any other. Q: Why then are both ruling parties losing popularity? A: Not all reforms are popular. I think that mass parties in many countries in Europe face a much tougher challenge. We have called for more individualisation, more open democratic systems, more plebiscites, so we must not wonder that the citizen comes back and uses the opportunities that have been opened. The individual citizen no longer subscribes to a political party as fully reflecting his own thinking as he did earlier in the post-war era: This is not an excuse. I am aware that we have to try harder. Q: How optimistic are you about completing negotiations aimed at Austria's joining the European Community? A: The most important point is that we become members by 1996, so that we can not only attend the intergovernmental conference as members, but also participate in the preparatory work. Therefore, I took up the EC's suggestion that we should become members by January 1, 1995. I see no reason why we should not take this date seriously. Q: Austria has long been an immigration and asylum country, but has recently closed its borders to immigrants. Is this a permanent change in policy? A: Eight to 9 per cent of the people in this country are immigrants. That is not an extremely low rate by international standards. Some of our new laws aim at keeping the number of those coming in within magnitudes that we still can cope with. In 1994, we will open again to some 25,000 immigrants. There is no limit on asylum seekers. Q: Is Austria reassessing its security needs in the light of new challenges since the end of the cold war? A: We have to deal with an increased number of conscientious objectors. We have to modernise equipment. And with this modernised equipment, we will try to increase our ability to join United Nations forces in trouble spots int he world. We have abstained from defining a different kind of threat after the east-west antagonism vanished. We say only that we must always be in a position to defend our borders. Q: How do you feel about the evolution of the new regimes in central and eastern Europe? A: They have serious deficiencies in infrastructure that lead to a smaller capacity to improve their private economies. We need a new initiative - Europeans together, not on a bilateral basis - to develop their infrastructure. They cannot do it by themselves, and it is unwise for us to say to them, 'First develop your infrastructure, and then we will come with investment'. I have recently asked my German and Italian and Finnish colleagues - those in the front-line states, so to speak - to work together to support our financial and industrial groups to pool resources and concentrate on a number of specific projects.</p>

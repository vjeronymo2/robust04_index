			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq has informed the Arab League that the Saudi and  Kuwaiti rulers continue to grant facilities to the U.S.,  British, and French aircraft for violating Iraqi airspace and  threatening Iraq's security, sovereignty, and national unity.    In a letter he addressed to the Arab League secretary  general  yesterday, Iraq's Arab League permanent representative said that  these aircraft continued to violate Iraqi airspace 25-30 April  from their bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, and carried out 233  hostile air sorties.    A list appended to the letter explains these violations in  detail.</p>

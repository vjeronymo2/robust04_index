			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kennecott joins diamond hunt KENNECOTT, THE North American subsidiary of Britain's RTZ, is the latest in a growing list of leading mining companies to join a stampede for diamonds in the remote Northwest Territories and Canada's prairie provinces. Kennecott, whose activities in Canada consist mainly of joint ventures with junior exploration companies, has teamed up with Aber Resources in the area centred on Lac de Gras, about 350 km (220 miles) north-east of Yellowknife, the territories' capital. In exchange for investing CDollars 10m (Pounds 4.3m) over the next five years, Kennecott has obtained a right to a 60pc interest in the project. The Canadian mining industry has been buzzing with rumours about a rich diamond deposit since last November when Dia Met Minerals, another junior company, announced that it had found some small stones under Lac de Gras. BHP-Utah Mines, a subsidiary of BHP of Australia, has rights to a 51 per cent interest in the Dia Met property. Share prices of Dia Met, Aber and other companies involved in the hunt have rocketed on the Toronto and Vancouver stock exchanges. Dia Met said in May that a sample of 160 tonnes of ore yielded at least 90 carats of diamonds, of which about a quarter appear to be of gem quality. Mr Ed McLeod, mining recorder for the Department of Energy and Mines in Yellowknife, said yesterday that sales of claim tags for the Lac de Gras area increased sharply in May and June. A total of 4,243 claims covering 9.6m acres, or 15,000 square miles, were staked by July 15. Another 3,900 sets of tags, each entitling the holder to one claim, have been sold. Mr John Stephenson, president of Kennecott Canada, said evaluation work was still in a 'very early' stage. He said that RTZ might issue more details of its work at Lac de Gras within the next few days. Monopros, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of De Beers, is understood to have expanded its presence in Canada in recent months as a result of the activity in the Northwest Territories. An official of the company, which is based in Toronto, said that it had just started a sampling programme - the first stage of on-the-ground investigation - in the Lac de Gras area. Exploration has also accelerated in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Besides Monopros, the most active prospectors in Saskatchewan are Uranerz of Germany and Cameco, the large Canadian uranium producer. The focus of their attention is an area close to Prince Albert, in the centre of the province.</p>

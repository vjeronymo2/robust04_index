			<p>BFN     [Text] The special session of the Sevastopol City Council  Tuesday took a decision to propose to the Ukrainian leadership  to re-deploy the staff and other facilities of the Ukrainian  Navy from Sevastopol to another place. The session also decided  to consider reasonable the decision by the presidents of Russia  and Ukraine to the effect that further joint basing of two  fleets in Sevastopol was impossible.    The Sevastopol City Council is soon to make a request to the  new Ukrainian parliament and the Russian Federal Assembly to  urgently help solve, in line with the Massandra  Russian-Ukrainian protocol, the problem of the Black Sea Fleet.    The city council proposed that the presidents of Ukraine and  Russia invite a delegation from Sevastopol and the Crimea for  the bilateral talks on the Black Sea Fleet scheduled for April  24.    The session adopted an address to the peoples of Ukraine and  Russia, which says that the Black Sea Fleet will be Russian and  will be based in Sevastopol.    The resolution says that the conflicts between the Black Sea  Fleet and the Ukrainian Navy have become constant. Since the  matter went as far as to threats to use force, says the  document, the residents of Sevastopol, the inhabitants of the  Crimea and of other places where units of the Black Sea Fleet  and of the Ukrainian Navy are stationed cannot feel safe.    The session denounced the confrontation within the fleet,  caused as deputies believe, by a lack of resoluteness and  consistency on the part of Ukrainian and Russian leaders.    The city council urged the Russian and Ukrainian peoples to  launch a public movement for the early implementation of the  Russian-Ukrainian agreements on the Black Sea Fleet.    Meanwhile, Nikolay Savchenko, leader of the Ukrainian Navy  press center, told Interfax that the decision on basing the  Ukrainian naval force in Sevastopol was outside the competence  of the city council. He said that a relevant statement by the  Ukrainian naval command could appear shortly.</p>

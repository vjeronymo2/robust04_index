			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GASSING UP AT ONTARIO AIRPORT  </P> <P> Alaska Airlines' convoluted exercise of departing John Wayne Airport within  prescribed weight limits, then landing at Ontario Airport to take on fuel, is  tantamount to exporting garbage to a neighboring state ("Refueling Stop Is  Airline's Weight-Reduction Secret," Sept. 26).  </P> <P> Not only does this machination transfer the noise of an unnecessary arrival and  departure to the Ontario area, but it is blatantly wasteful of fuel and  frivolously exposes the passengers to the slight safety risk of an unproductive  landing and takeoff at Ontario.  </P> <P> Add that slight safety risk to the considerable safety risk of the noise  abatement departure procedure at John Wayne Airport, coupled with the exposure  to low-altitude, non-controlled small-aircraft traffic en route to Ontario, and  the result is a flight, I, as a former airline pilot, would rather not ride on.  </P> <P> I'd much rather go to Ontario by surface transportation in the first instance  and board the flight there.  </P> <P> John Wayne Airport, with its too-short runways, mix of heavy and small aircraft  traffic and its inane power-reduction, noise abatement procedures, makes the  airport an accident waiting to happen.  </P> <P> The new terminal building only contributes to the determination to increase  operations at this wholly inadequate airport, and thus statistically -- at the  least -- brings closer the inevitable horrible air disaster at, or in proximity  to, John Wayne.  </P> <P> WALLACE B.

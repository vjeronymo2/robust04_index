			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin says he will demand  from Yasir 'Arafat to reaffirm in writing his commitment to the  peace agreement signed earlier this month. 'Oded Ben-'Ami, the  prime minister's spokesman, said that 'Arafat's speech in  Johannesburg casts doubts on his sincerity with regard to the  peace agreement. Ben-'Ami noted that Israel will put off the  negotiations on the second stage of the agreement with the  Palestinians until the PLO consolidates its rule in Gaza and  Jericho.    In response, PLO member Jamil al-Tarifi said that any delay  in the implementation of the next stage of the autonomy will  constitute a deviation from the agreement.</p>

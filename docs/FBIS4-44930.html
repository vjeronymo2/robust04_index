			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Baghdad Mayor Tahir Muhammad Hassun, by </F> Hamid 'Abdallah; place and date not given: "Baghdad Mayor Wants  Trustworthy City Administration"--first three paragraphs are  ALIF BA' introduction]    [Text] Many questions crowded into my mind, each of them  wanting priority over the others and each of them seeking a  clear answer. Where shall I begin with Mr. Tahir Muhammad  Hassun, the mayor of Baghdad? How much time do I need to satisfy  my curiosity and come out with the result I desire?    The man gave me no opportunity to arrange my questions, for  he spoke first, as if he had read my mind. He asked and  answered, inquired and explained. My journalistic duty forces me  to say that I heard not one word of justification from him. He  did not take the role of defense attorney for his institution,  as many do. Instead, I found him taking the side of the citizen  against the apparatus of his department, many of whose practices  he criticized.    He did not mince his words. He said there are negative  phenomena that must be uprooted, corrupt elements of which the  city administration must be cleansed. In this area there is  dilatoriness; in that area there is negligence. Thus it was an  interview more characterized by agreement than by disagreement  and argument.  <H5>  Corrupt Officials, Out-of-Control Citizens </H5>   ['Abdallah] What is the first priority on your agenda?    [Hassun] Many tasks are competing for priority and  precedence. I can list them as follows: Baghdad's cleanliness,  maintaining the sewage system, repairing cave-ins, and keeping  the drinking water network at the required purity.    ['Abdallah] Have you given each of these its share of  attention?    [Hassun] Our basic problem lies in our insufficient  technical  and human resources due to conditions of the embargo. The  resources of a single municipal unit of metropolitan Baghdad in  terms of engineering and mechanical effort used to equal the  resources of the municipality as a whole after the embargo.  Nevertheless, this situation does not warrant weak performance  in any section. We must not make the embargo a peg on which to  hang the persistence of the negative phenomena and conditions  that emerge in various places. We must uproot and eradicate them  whatever the circumstances. Accordingly, we must be on the scene  to observe, monitor, and diagnose the places where defect hides.  We must examine the efficiency of performance. Through intensive  presence on the scene, we have discovered many negative  phenomena and have rung the bell to announce that there are  defects in two basic elements: the corrupt official and the  out-of-control citizen.    ['Abdallah] However, the directives and laws of the mayor's  office have contributed to creating corrupt officials by giving  lower-level staffs powers that enable them to treat people  arbitrarily.    [Hassun] That is true. We have dealt seriously with the  matter by restricting penal powers to high-level  staffs--specifically, in the field monitoring apparatus, the  unit directors, and general directors. We noticed that the  lower-level staffs that had power and authority to fine and  punish had begun to collude shamefully with violators. A minor  city official could be bought for a paltry price. With the taste  of his free lunch still in his mouth, he would become a defender  of the restaurant owner who threw trash into the middle of the  street. He would also be accustomed to taking his cut from  storekeepers--each in his specialty. An official could get his  food free from a restaurant owner, have his hair cut without fee  by the barber, have his car repaired without cost at the  mechanic's, and take regular protection money from wrongdoers,  turning a blind eye to their misdeeds in return. He would see  people throw trash and oil into the sewer lines or leave it  wherever they wanted, and would turn his eyes--and the city be  damned! I say this in sadness and bitterness, after having  uncovered many such elements and having been forced to dismiss  them and cleanse the city bureaucracy of them. If you ask me  what the duty of the lower-level staffs should be, I say that  their real duty is to monitor the movement of garbage trucks.  This is their duty according to the ordinance of the city of  Baghdad. Anyone who likes this duty is welcome; anyone who  doesn't--goodbye to him!    ['Abdallah] This means that the number of inspectors has  become restricted to the number of unit and general directors.  Do you think this number issufficient to monitor the streets of  Baghdad, as extensive as they are?    [Hassun] Our mission is not to give punishments and fines to  citizens. Our goal is to establish behavior and models that  citizens respect, rather than what a city official wants. What  harm would there be if the administration's upper staff,  starting with the mayor and ending with the unit directors,  turned into inspectors, if that protected citizens from the  blackmail of the weak-spirited and realized the noble end we all  seek--the cleanliness of our beloved Baghdad? I am sure that if  citizens see real, just, and serious oversight, they will be  eager to obey the municipal laws. Thus we shall achieve the  desired goal of municipal discipline.  <H5>  Major Blight </H5>   ['Abdallah] This concerns the commercial and tourist  districts. What about the residential districts? Garbage has  begun to accumulate in some of them until there are tall piles  of trash, as well as overflowing and clogged sewers.    [Hassun] I agree with you that our service efforts in the  residential districts are not at the desired level. This is  because our attention now is focused on the tourist and  commercial districts. If the service units we have established  in the commercial and tourist streets bear fruit, and if the  sanitation contractors can carry out their duties successfully  and trustworthily despite our observations against them, we  shall be able to move a large part of our service effort to the  residential districts. We hope to do this shortly.    ['Abdallah] While we are on the subject of sanitation  contractors, are you satisfied with their work? Didn't the city  administration cancel its contracts with them not too long ago,  and then contract with them again? What was the reason?    [Hassun] Necessities required that we again enter into  contracts with the contractors. In the past, some of them were  selected on dishonest principles. But I am for encouraging and  supporting the experiment if correct, sound, and honest formulas  are found. I think that large sanitation companies must be  created, as are found in many countries. Although we have  recorded our observations against some of them, we are not  hesitating to support by various formulas and means those that  are dedicated.    ['Abdallah] You announced that all the pumps draining the  water of the sewers would be repaired. Yet despite the shortage  of water in the current winter season, many of Baghdad's streets  have been flooded. What was the cause?    [Hassun] There are 259 main water drainage stations in  Baghdad, with 910 vertical and submerged pumps. There are 6,000  km of rain, sewage, and shared pipes, in addition to 600,000  rain water grills scattered throughout the city of Baghdad. You  can imagine the effort required to maintain and repair this  complicated large network that has not been given any real  maintenance since it was built until the time of the broad  campaign we have undertaken for this purpose.    The overflows that flooded the streets had many causes. For  one thing, rain water grills became blocked because trash had  accumulated in them and because grease had been discarded. There  were also the cave-ins that the sewer network has  suffered--between 25 and 30 every month, some medium-sized, some  big, with depths from 1 to 9 meters. Add to this the  obsolescence of the sewer network and the effect of the  30-nation aggression, which was accompanied by a complete  stoppage of the drainage pumps. This led to a rise in the level  of stagnant water and its not being drained. The result was  instability of the ground, not to mention the obvious effect in  this regard of the flood season that the country experienced in  1988. However, I concentrate here on an essential cause--what I  would call the "killer cause"--misuse of the drainage networks  by citizens.    Surely you have heard about the blockage of the sewers in  Saddam City. We made a field investigation of the state of the  sewer system there and found--marvel of marvels!--we discovered  that all the waste and residue that the industrial district in  Kisrah and 'Atash produces are thrown into the sewers--grease,  automobile parts, tires, and animals. What network is there that  could swallow all these objects? What pumps could get rid of  them? We diagnosed three main sources of damage to the sewage  system in Saddam City: street vendors, the industrial district  in Kisrah and 'Atash, and the popular markets.    We have formulated a plan to clean up and maintain the sewer  system in Saddam City in coordination with the General  Federation of Labor Unions. Shop owners in Kisrah and 'Atash  will bear part of the cost of maintaining and cleaning up the  sewers. We have collected 3 million dinars for this purpose. As  a first step, we have built 13 regular lots for street vendors  in the whole of Baghdad. We have taken the initiative to fence  and pave the popular markets. We have set a time limit for  completing this task not to exceed three months.  <H5>  Flight From "Repellent Occupation" </H5>   ['Abdallah] One notices that many residential-district open  spaces designated as parks have become areas to collect garbage.  Aren't the units of the Baghdad municipal administration  concerned about these areas?    [Hassun] The natural place for these wastes is the  sanitation  burial area 50 km from the center of the city of Baghdad. But  because of a shortage of vehicles to transport waste, we have  been forced to create temporary trash collection areas. The  trash will be transported later to the sanitation burial area.  Therefore, the areas to which you referred have to be cleaned  up, and their trash must be taken to the temporary collection  areas. The reason for its accumulation has to do with the lack  of resources in city administration units, as I mentioned to you  at the beginning of the interview.    ['Abdallah] Haven't you found a means to deal with the  phenomenon of citizens' aversion to taking jobs and positions  with the Baghdad city administration?    [Hassun] The essential reason for aversion to working in  some  city occupations is social attitude, which cannot be remedied by  administrative decree. Nevertheless, in order to create  incentives sufficient to overcome this phenomenon, we have  established a system of incentives and productivity criteria. We  have granted the general directors full powers for this purpose.  However, city occupations remain "repellent occupations," rather  than "attractive" ones.    ['Abdallah] What was the first negative phenomenon you  remedied after you assumed responsibility for Baghdad's city  administration?    [Hassun] The first slogan I raised was: "War on lying." No  one shall make me hear the words "Yes, sir!" without their being  accompanied by honest and exact implementation. I have continued  to make war on liars and dishonest people. My ultimate goal is  to cleanse the city administration of corrupt people and reward  and support those who are sincere and honest.    ['Abdallah] We said goodbye to the mayor of Baghdad, having  taken from his office an important fact--that the mayor has  assumed a heavy legacy of bureaucracy, job corruption, and  administrative idling. As a result, bad money in the Baghdad  administrative has driven out the good. This equation he is  determined to reverse. May none but the trustworthy remain  trustees!</p>

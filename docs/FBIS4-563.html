			<p>BFN     [Text] A new association of political parties has just  been formed. It is called the Grouping for Solidarity  [Groupement pour la Solidarite -- GPS], with Mr. Achi Koman as  its president. Mr. Achi Koman tells our correspondent David  Mobio everything about the GPS.    [Begin Koman recording] There are 19 political parties that  formally signed the charter of the GPS on Thursday, 31 March  1994 at the city mayor's office. This newly constituted GPS  professes to be a centrist party. What does that mean? On the  political scene there is a very strong party, which is the  ruling party, on the right; there is another party on the left,  which is relatively strong, which is trying to impose its  hegemony there. We believe that politically there is a third  place in Cote d'Ivoire to be filled, and that is the center, and  this is what the GPS has done. All political parties which  reject unrestricted capitalism or communism should be able to  join the GPS, that is, locate themselves in the center in order  to be able to practice what we call economic pragmatism. Since  ideologies do not work anymore, all political regimes are  converging toward the center, and are today practicing economic  pragmatism. This is the economic basis of our union.    We stayed out of all the groupings that had taken place  before, because from our experience we know that when unions are  formed, in the beginning things are rushed and they lead to a  lot of misunderstandings. Mistakes and bitterness follow.  There have been unions before -- there was the Coordinating  Committee, the Convention -- which broke up -- the Collective of  Eight, the Union of Democratic Forces, the Ivorian Democratic  Conference, the Federation of Democratic Forces, there were a  lot of unions -- and all these unions failed. So when we met on  12 February, we set up a working committee, which comprised  representatives from all these various unions which had failed.  Each representative brought what he experienced in each of  these unions. Why did these unions fail? The answer to the whys  of the failure of these unions enabled us to draw up the  constituent charter for the GPS, which is helping us to avoid  all the things that caused the failure of the other unions. We  believe we have been able to outline the framework of this union  so as to enable it really to achieve the objectives assigned to  it. In actual fact, the other unions which were formed had never  outlined any major political objectives such as we have -- that  is the first thing; second, the unions which were formed  previously never had as their objective the formation of a  strong union through the encouragement of the various member  political parties in weaving a network of solidarity within that  union. People just meet and agree on who will be the leader and  then say there will be leadership by turns. Such leadership by  turns does not allow leaders to actually manage the union, but  rather try to draw benefits from the union for themselves.  These are some of the factors that caused the failure of these  unions.    We have placed in the forefront-- and this is what is  important -- the major objectives of the GPS, which are national  solidarity, the unification of Africa, and the assertion of an  African cultural identity. Consequently, we came together  around an objective, not around party interests. [end recording]</p>

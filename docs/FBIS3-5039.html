			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Central Committee of the South Korean National Democratic Front  [SKNDF] (Hanminjon) released a statement on February 26  denouncing the South Korean authorities for dumping nuclear  waste into the East Sea of Korea, the Seoul-based radio Voice of  National Salvation reported.    Noting that nuclear waste dumped into the East Sea of Korea  by the atomic power stations of South Korea from 1986 to 1992  amounted to 11,000 trillion becquerels, or about 100,000 curies,  the statement said:    As a result, the East Sea of Korea has already turned into a  "sea of death" and Ullung Island into the "second Bikini."    Such anti-national criminal acts of the South Korean  authorities have caused wholesale deaths of fishes and  extermination of fishes, shellfishes and cultured sea products  in the sea off Uljin, Wolsong and Kori where atomic power  stations are situated. A diver's wife gave birth to a brain  immature infant and many people are dying of incurable diseases  of unknown origin after eating fishes caught in the sea.    Our people are now eating radioactive materials and sleeping  on the U.S. nuclear-powder keg which may explode at time, with  their heads resting on pillows of nuclear waste from atomic  power stations.    The South Korean authorities have kept media from reporting  about the release of radioactive materials from atomic power  stations in a bid to cover up their crimes. Worse still, they  unhesitatingly perpetrated such a treacherous act as concealing  even the dumping of 900 tons of nuclear waste into the East Sea  of Korea by Russia with a hypocritical "investigation" in which  they alleged "they could not find a sign of pollution."    The Kim Yong-sam group must immediately make public the  amount and kinds of nuclear waste dumpted into the sea and the  dumping places, apologize to the whole nation and promptly stop  such an act. If it continue dumping nuclear waste into the sea,  it can by no means escape a stern judgement by the nation and  mankind.</p>

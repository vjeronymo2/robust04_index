The trustees will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning the amounts expended under the Plans and the related Plan Agreements complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b-1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees to justify any fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocation upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the independent trustees in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. Dividends paid by a Fund regarding a class of shares will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day and will be in the same amount as dividends paid by that Fund, except that Plan Payments made by a class under its Plan and any Class Expenses will be borne exclusively by the affected class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends/distributions of the various classes and the proper allocation of expenses among the classes has been reviewed by an expert (the ``Expert'') who has rendered a report to the applicants, which report has been provided to the staff of the SEC, that such methodology and procedures are adequate to ensure that such calculations and allocations would be made in an appropriate manner. On an ongoing basis, the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, will monitor the manner in which the calculations and allocations are being made and, based upon such review, will render at least annually a report to the Investment Company that the calculations and allocations are being made properly. The reports of the Expert will be filed as part of the periodic reports filed with the SEC pursuant to sections 30(a) and 30(b)(1) of the Act and the work papers of the Expert with respect to such reports, following a request by the Investment Company (which the Investment Company agrees to provide), will be available for inspection by the SEC staff upon the written request by a senior member of the SEC's Division of Investment Management or a Regional Office of the SEC. Authorized staff members would be limited to the Director, an Associate Director, the Chief Accountant, the Chief Financial Analyst, an Assistant Director, and any Regional Administrators or Associate and Assistant Administrators. The initial report of the Expert is a ``report on policies and procedures placed in operation'' and the ongoing reports will be ``reports on policies and procedures placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness'' as defined and described in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), as it may be amended from time to time, or in similar auditing standards as may be adopted by the AICPA from time to time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

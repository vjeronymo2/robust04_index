			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Books: Strange obsessions - Fiction YANN ANDREA STEINER by Marguerite Duras Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 12.99, 115 pages NOW THAT YOU'RE BACK by AL Kennedy Jonathan Cape Paperback Original Pounds 8.99, 248 pages A massive oeuvre and an extraordinary, sometimes heroic life have earned Marguerite Duras, now 80, a place in the Hall of Fame alongside Colette, Piaf, Violette Leduc and Simone de Beauvoir. Duras's revelation that her novel L'Amant, 1985, set in what is now Vietnam, about the affair between a schoolgirl and a wealthy Chinese man, was entirely autobiographical brought notoriety as well as the Prix Goncourt, the Ritz Hemingway Award and world-wide sales. Yann Andrea Steiner, her latest novel, translated by Barbara Bray, is addressed to her lover and companion for the past 14 years. She wrote about 'the sexual labyrinth' of their relationship in Blue Eyes, Black Hair; here she recalls in elegaic mood the summer of 1980 when the young homosexual Breton turned up at her apartment on the Normandy coast, and stayed. Yann is almost as obsessed with her writing as is Duras herself, and needs to know what became of Theodora Kats, an English Jewish girl stranded in wartime Germany, whose story Duras began and could not finish. In the course of this non-linear, nouveau romanesque narrative Duras offers several endings but cannot find a resolution. Theodora, with her white skin and white dresses, marooned at a wayside railway station, waiting for the train that will take her to freedom or to Auschwitz, has become symbolic of all women and all Jews. Duras, whose first husband almost died in a concentration camp and who worked for the Resistance, with Francois Mitterrand, has the right to take this stance. Her determination neither to forget nor forgive is evinced as she observes the residents of a summer camp for deprived children, and imagines them as survivors of the Holocaust. Her technique, as she focuses on a teenage girl counsellor and a little boy, now in longshot, now in close-up, is cinematic, reminiscent of her work as film-maker and screenplay writer. The girl consoles the child, with an unfortunately mawkish tale of magic realism, and as their love grows they might be aspects of Duras the story-teller, and Yann the listener. Throughout the narrative there is much reported weeping and laughter, which excludes rather than provokes sympathetic tears in the reader. Paradoxically, while the novel is sometimes confusing, its prose has the intense clarity of the coastal light that illuminates its characters. AL Kennedy, born in 1965, is at the beginning of a career which has brought prizes already and the dubious distinction of inclusion in the soi disant Best of Young British Novelists list. Now That You're Back is her second collection of stories and shows signs of having been cobbled together to keep her in the public eye. Too many of the pieces here are arch makeweights without humour or psychological truth, but three or four stories demonstrate what she can do when she engages with real people and situations. It is tempting to wonder if 'Like a City in the Sea', about a painter married to a much older former ballet dancer, and the film crew which invades their lives, was inspired by a television documentary on the dancer Lynn Seymour. Kennedy's dancer is dying of an unspecified disease, and the dialogue between husband and wife, who avoid the unspeakable by lapsing into mock-cockney and calling each other 'Mum' and 'Dad', has an embarrassing tenderness. 'Warming My Hands And Telling Lies' is a warning to writers against giving readings in schools. A callow young reporter tracks down a woman writer with whom he fell in love as a schoolboy. Monagh Cairns has abandoned writing and lives in seclusion. Naturally she disappoints the youth, and he turns on her; but, determined to relaunch her career, he leaves with an unpublished manuscript in his pocket. A fairly routine account of a little Scottish prostitute in London, 'Friday Payday', is redeemed by its heartbreaking ending when the girl's hard veneer is cracked by a Tourist Board poster for an adman's Scotland, and a similar raw pain informs the title story. Two brothers try, literally and mentally, to accommodate a third who is convalescing after a spell in a drying-out clinic. The awkwardness of their shared caravan holiday as they blunder around with good intentions and bleak optimism in too small a space is portrayed with a delicate realism that ought to direct Kennedy away from fantasy.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Kamil Bayalinov under the "Chinese Ceremonies" </F> rubric: "Chinese People's Nuclear Tests Fall to the Lot of the  Kyrgyz People"]    [Text] The Kyrgyz Foreign Ministry has finally responded  to this Chinese nuclear explosion with a "statement." The mild  document, retouched by experienced diplomats, says that  Kyrgyzstan..."welcomes the aspiration expressed by China for the  complete destruction of and ban on nuclear weapons, as well as  for the achievement of a universal ban on nuclear testing." The  whole tone of the statement is couched in a spirit as if  Kyrgyzstan were apologizing for its nuclear tests. However, at  the end of the "memorandum," the diplomats got down to business:  "In the space of not quite two years, China has carried out  three nuclear tests. To us it is obvious that such tests have a  negative effect on the environmental situation and the health of  people in the region. Kyrgyzstan, as a state which borders  directly on China, is experiencing justified and growing concern  about this matter."    Having carefully studied the document, the Chinese Embassy  in  Bishkek delivered its answer to Kyrgyz representatives. It  reports that China unfailingly advocates "the complete  destruction of and ban on nuclear weapons, and, in this context,  the implementation of a universal ban on nuclear tests." But  since China understands the concern of its neighbors perfectly  well, then it is exerting every effort to conclude treaties on a  universal ban on nuclear explosions....    Following such an answer, it evidently remains for the  Kyrgyz  to apologize for the trouble caused to the Chinese.    The Chinese nuclear test range at Lop Nor is situated to the  south of East Turkestan, which is now part of the Xinjiang Uygur  Autonomous Region. The first explosion occurred in October  1964. By the late 1960's there had been a series of tests of  hydrogen bombs. At first the test range occupied a modest area  -- 56 km by 36 km -- but then it expanded considerably. The PRC  nuclear research center is located here. Three operating sites  for conducting explosions on land, underground, and in the air,  are located on the territory of the test range. A test range  for the study of the effect of radiation on animals and plants  is situated near the city of Hotan. But the zone of the effect  of radiation on people does not just include the entire Chinese  autonomous area, but also one-half of Kyrgyzstan and part of  Kazakhstan. According to figures from the  "Nevada-Semipalatinsk" international antinuclear movement, after  every hydrogen bomb test at the Lop Nor test range, the infant  mortality rate in Alma-Ata [Almaty] and the area has gone up by  30-60 percent.    It is interesting that at the time of the latest test at Lop  Nor, east winds have been blowing over the test range (this is  very rare in the area, incidentally), in a direction away from  Central China and toward Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. Following  the nuclear explosion in May 1992, aerosol tests in Bishkek  showed an increase in the activity of ruthenium and strontium  radiation by a factor of 20. And after all, Bishkek is 1,000 km  away from the test range!    However, as far as radiation is concerned, there are no  borders or distances. The Chernobyl tragedy is an example of  this.    In four months' time, the Lop Nor test range will be 30  years  old. During this period, the Chinese military have conducted 22  surface and 15 underground tests of nuclear and thermonuclear  weapons. Naturally, without informing either their own citizens  or the governments of adjacent countries about it.    The latest explosion resounded 10 June of this year. A  powerful cyclone swept over northern Kyrgyzstan within several  days. Information about an increase in the radiation level has  not found its way into the press yet. The Kyrgyz leadership is  adopting all possible measures to reduce anti-Chinese moods  among the people, which are being intensified from one day to  the next. And not only because of the nuclear tests being  carried out by the mighty neighbor.</p>

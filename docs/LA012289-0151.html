			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ICE FISHING FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> MORE THAN 25,000 WILL BRAVE COLD TO COMPETE ON MICHIGAN LAKE  </P> <P> More than 25,000 fishermen are braving probable zero or subzero weather this  weekend in the biggest ice-fishing derby in the nation. And there will be about  that many here next weekend, too.  </P> <P> It's the 39th annual Tip-Up Town, USA, Ice-Fishing Festival here on Houghton  Lake, Michigan's biggest of more than 11,000 inland lakes.  </P> <P> Tip-Ups are rigs that hold a reel and line set in a hole in the ice. They pop  up a tiny red flag when a fish takes the bait, giving fishermen a signal that  he has a bite.  </P> <P> When the flag suddenly goes up, the action is on. Ice fishing is a skill sport.  The fisherman has to have his line set at the proper distance beneath the ice.  When the fish hits the bait and the spool stops, then starts again, it is time  to set the hook and reel in the reluctant fish.  </P> <P> Houghton Lake, 8 miles across and 16 miles long in the northern part of  Michigan's Lower Peninsula, looks like a sieve, what with all those fishing  holes.  </P> <P> This tribute to the sport of ice fishing will also feature contests for the  biggest fish, snowmobile races, ice sculpture competition, softball on ice,  golf on ice and other esoteric activities.  </P> <P> Fishing is the main attraction, though, and the fishermen take it seriously.  Last year, the biggest northern pike caught during the Tip-Up Town contest was  3 feet long and weighed 12 pounds 12 ounces. The biggest Walleye weighed 6-2  and measured 23 1/2 inches.  </P> <P> On Saturday, there was a big parade from Pinky's Plaza Shopping Center onto the  lake with several elaborate floats made of crepe paper -- no Rose Parade floats  with flowers in this icebox. Many floats were in the shape of huge walleyes,  northerns, bluegills, perch and other lake fish.  </P> <P> A carnival with a Ferris wheel is going on and there was a big dance inside a  heated tent. Concession stands are strategically located on the ice, offering  refreshments and souvenirs to those who come to fish and to those who come to  watch those who fish.  </P> <P> Houghton Lake Postmaster Ruth Coons is operating a portable post office on the  ice and all letters posted here are canceled with a special Tip-Up Town, USA,  Ice Festival postmark.  </P> <P> Houghton Lake is the heart of winter recreation country in Michigan, the hub of  a network of 5,400 miles of groomed snowmobile trails.  </P> <P> Thousands have brought their snowmobiles to the ice-fishing festival from all  corners of the state. Michigan has 205,000 registered snowmobiles, more than  any other state.  </P> <P> Michigan recently spent $2.5 million on 42 new snow grooming machines for the  trails. This year, the state will spend another $2.5 million for trail grooming  -- $1.5 million from gasoline taxes, $1 million from registration fees. There  are 5 times more miles of groomed snowmobile trails than freeways for cars in  this state.  </P> <P> In Houghton Lake, population 7,000, there are 16 sporting goods stores catering  to the needs of ice fishermen, selling live bait -- minnows and suckers --  canvas shelters ($180) with room enough to protect two fishermen from the  elements, tip-ups, weights, line, hooks, jigging lures and other equipment.  </P> <P> At shops such as Linda and Dave Perkins' Edgewater Beach Marina, fishermen can  rent the tiny ice-fishing houses, called shanties, for $12 a day, including a  propane heater and fuel. Hand warmers, at $3 a pop, are also a popular item.  </P> <P> "The ice is nice and thick -- 10 inches thick clear across the lake now,"  informs Linda Perkins. "It should hold a car or pickup with no trouble, unless  the vehicle falls through a pressure crack."  </P> <P> She quickly adds: "If your car goes through the ice, we'll gladly haul it out  of the drink for $2,500. That's as cheap as anybody on the lake."  </P> <P> A winter doesn't pass without at least a dozen cars sinking to the bottom. The  lake is 18 feet at its deepest. Ice-fishing season here generally runs from  about mid-December until the end of March.  </P> <P> It was 10 above zero, the wind-chill factor making it 10 below, a few days  before the ice festival when 45 members of the Lansing Police Department were  at Houghton Lake for their 12th-annual 1-day ice-fishing contest. They drove  120 miles to get here.  </P> <P> "We come up ahead of the mob. It's too crowded for us during the Tip-Up Town,  USA, Ice Festival weekends," explained Bob Delamarter, 34, traffic officer for  the department.  </P> <P> Capt. Jim Heyden, 50, said he has been ice fishing every winter of his life  that he can remember.  </P> <P> "I don't like fishing out of a boat," he said. "I like walking on water."  </P> <P> Sgt. Joe Rodriguez, one of three Latinos on the Lansing PD -- he came north  from San Benito, Tex. -- said it was a pleasure to join the troops on Houghton  Lake for the camaraderie, the great ice fishing and to get away from the  pressures of the big city.  </P> <P> Big city? Lansing's population is 130,000. All things are relative, of course.  </P> <P> The Lansing officers kept warm by ducking into their shanties and by wolfing  down bowls of steaming hot chili. They wore "water snake" logos showing a  tip-up and an ice fisherman embraced by a snake coiled around his body.  </P> <P> "Ice fishermen call the (immature) northern pike snakes," said officer John  Hunnell, who recalled the big controversy that occurred in one of the recent  annual outings:  </P> <P> "A fish took my line and reel under the ice. Officer Don Dunham was fishing  nearby. It was moments before the 5 p.m. deadline to stop fishing. Dunham's  hook caught my reel. He pulled in my line and the biggest fish of the day which  I, not Dunham, originally caught.  </P> <P> "I claimed the fish. I was overruled. Dunham walked away with the giant fish  and all the money."  </P> <P> Brandon Temple, 16-year-old son of detective Deane Temple, was the ice auger  man, spudding new holes for the officers with his 7-foot-long auger.  </P> <P> When a reporter's four pens all froze and note-taking became impossible,  Lansing's finest roared.  </P> <P> "Now you know what we go through in the cold," Sgt. Daryl Zuk said, laughing.  "Many a time an officer starts writing a ticket and can't go on. His pen is  frozen. Sometimes he lets the guy go."  </P> <P> Detective Charlie Shawnee and others mentioned Magic Johnson, whose hometown is  Lansing.  </P> <P> "Tell our friend Magic to come join us next year. We'll teach him how to  dribble snowballs," laughed Shawnee.  </P> <P> "Some of the guys from LAPD ought to join us, too. They would never believe  this. Never believe we would rather be doing this than sitting at home beside a  fire, watching TV."  </P> <P> By midday, Deane Battley, Mike Foster, Tim Heyden, Charlie Shawnee, Daryl Zuk  and Paul Wilkins had reeled in the biggest "snakes," northern pike 20 inches to  2 feet long.  </P> <P> A short distance away, dairy farmer Keith De Ruiter, 38, and his three sons,  Wes, 8, Todd, 10, and Matt, 15, stood near their pickup truck, a half-mile out  in the ice, waiting for a nibble.  </P> <P> "We ice-fish as often as we can get away," said De Ruiter. "There is no better  eating in the world than walleye and northern pike. The fish is firmer and  tastes better, caught through the ice in winter than in summer."  </P> <P> Thirty below zero isn't uncommon in this part of the country. Yet, the cold and  miserable weather do not discourage the hearty ice fishermen. Braving the  elements is part of the sport they say. The catch is well worth the trouble  they insist.  </P></p>

			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Observer: Force alarm Nigerian fraudsters, ever on the lookout for methods by which to separate businesses from their money, are gaining in sophistication. This time, the 'Presidential Task Force on Debt Repayment' - no less - has been contacting UK companies. The PTFDR fax enjoins addressees to send all financial details within 48 hours, promising their monies will be repaid. Failure to reply will lead to cancellation of debts. Needless to say, no such official taskforce exists - but it is a handy way of obtaining information and signatures and hence, potentially, cash. Mike Turner, the overseas trade manager of Birmingham's Chamber of Commerce who has blown the whistle on this and other such wizard scams, reckons that, if only the schemers had dreamed this one up in the early days, it would have done very nicely indeed. Back to the drawing board please.</p>

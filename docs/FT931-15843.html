			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / France 'ready to liberate camps' Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said yesterday France was prepared to act alone if necessary to liberate by force prisoner camps in Bosnia where civilians had been raped and tortured. 'I suggest we ensure that this liberation is put into effect if necessary by force, since we now have the legal right to intervene and there is evidence on the existence of these camps and of tortures and rape that are committed there,' Mr Dumas said on RTL radio. He said he had asked Mr Bernard Kouchner, the health and humanitarian affairs minister, to arrange 'if necessary on our own' for convoys under military escort to go to the camps and liberate them. Mr Dumas also said a UN resolution authorising the use of force to implement a no-fly zone over Bosnia should be passed in the next few days. 'This means shooting down planes if necessary and a right of pursuit and pre-emption if installations such as missile batteries or radars prevent them from carrying out their mission,' he said. Mr Kouchner earlier urged the UN to amend its arms embargo to allow the Bosnians to arm themselves. Mr Eduard Balladur, a favourite to become prime minister if the conservatives win the elections, yesterday also urged the UN to act. 'The time has come for vigorous intervention,' he said. Mr Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president, this weekend met President Francois Mitterrand, who is said to have agreed to discuss the possibility of intervention under the aegis of the UN.</p>

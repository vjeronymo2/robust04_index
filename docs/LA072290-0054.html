			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> SNUB OF OXNARD REAL ESTATE TOUR  </P> <P> Thank you for the article "Oxnard's Identity Crisis" (Thursday). I honestly  wish my efforts to attract real estate brokers to see Oxnard had generated a  different result.  </P> <P> As a member of the Inter-Neighborhood Council Committee representing Oxnard  Shores and the Colony at Mandalay Bay, I was disappointed to read INCC  Chairwoman Eleanore Branthoover's remarks that she couldn't be happier about  not attracting land-buyers. I believe her remarks to be personal and not  representative of INCC.  </P> <P> Real-estate buyers are also borrowers for local lending institutions, are  taxpayers for local governments, are consumers for local merchants, are  advocates for preserving the quality of life that attracted them and us to the  Channel Islands area in the first place.  </P> <P> These real estate buyers are also employers or key employees who influence the  future locations of their companies' facilities. Their decisions to locate  businesses in the area create job opportunities for our citizens. Those  companies become borrowers for local lending institutions, taxpayers for local  government, "consumers" for local merchants.  </P> <P> "Fast-" or "slow-"growth positions are bad business and/or quality of life  decisions. We need "thoughtful growth" which comes from having alternatives on  how we grow and at what rate.  </P> <P> Oxnard -- indeed Ventura County -- is a fast train on its way to "discovery."  Are we going to "engineer" the growth or let it run over us?  </P> <P> TOM CONWAY  </P> <P> Port Hueneme  </P></p>

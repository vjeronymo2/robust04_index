			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 30 Mar -- Problems relating to the  development of Russian-Kyrgyz relations and the peacekeeping  activities of the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly in Nagornyy  Karabakh were considered today at a meeting between Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev and Medetkan Sherimkulov,  chairman of the Kyrgyz Supreme Council and head of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group on Nagornyy  Karabakh.    Answering a question from the ITAR-TASS correspondent, the  head of Kyrgyzstan's parliament stated that the  Interparliamentary peacemaking group is now engaged in preparing  for a meeting of Azerbaijani, Armenian, and Nagornyy Karabakh  parliamentarians in Bishkek. He expressed the hope that success  will be achieved in organizing a frank exchange of opinions  between the heads of the parliaments of these states. According  to M. Sherimkulov he will tomorrow be flying to Baku and Yerevan  and afterwards will visit Stepanakert, where specific dates will  be agreed for the meeting.    "I should like to hope that the end result of our activities  will be peace. People are tired of war and of the fact that the  number of refugees is growing. Not one state gains from this,"  M. Sherimkulov emphasized. "If we managed to give help and  support in bringing the positions of the warring sides closer,  we should consider our mission useful," he said.    As a high-ranking Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman noted  in  a conversation with journalists, the Russian foreign policy  department fully supports the intention and desire of the CIS  Interparliamentary Assembly peacemaking group to take what part  it can in the process of settling the conflict in Nagornyy  Karabakh. According to him the Russian Foreign Ministry "is  working in close contact and is ready to provide expert  assistance in the work that this group is performing." The  Russian Foreign Ministry considers that this group "can play a  special role, since parliamentarians can promote the  establishment of an appropriate atmosphere in which it would be  possible to adopt the agreement on which the executive  structures are now working."    According to the high-ranking Russian diplomat the main aim  now is "to bring the sides together and to create an appropriate  atmosphere for the adoption of an agreement on halting the  conflict in Nagornyy Karabakh." This agreement has been worked  out in principle. Each side involved in the conflict has its  own approaches and probably much more effort will have to be  made for it to be signed, the Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman  stressed.</p>

			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TONIGHT'S FEATURED GAMES;  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH VS. CORONA DEL MAR  </P> <P> 1989 RECORDS -- Huntington Beach 0-10, Corona del Mar 11-3.  </P> <P> SITE -- Orange Coast College.  </P> <P> HUNTINGTON BEACH UPDATE -- After months of waiting, the Oilers can take the  sting of last season's bitter disappointment out on the field.  </P> <P> Last year, they finished 8-2 and won a share of the Sunset League championship.  However, the Oilers were forced to forfeit all eight victories because they  used an ineligible player in all 10 games. Tonight, the Oilers will see how  well they rebound. Quarterback Mike Chavira will direct the Oilers' balanced  offense. Linebackers Jeff Brentlinger, Don Berge and Gabe Houston lead a strong  defense.  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR UPDATE -- One of the most curious performances of the 1989  season was turned in by the Sea Kings. They slogged through the Sea View League  with a 2-3 record, but rallied and won the Division VI championship. The Sea  Kings lost to Huntington Beach, 19-6, but the Oilers later forfeited the  victory. Quarterback Todd Kehrli showed a steady hand in passing for 1,600  yards as a sophomore. The bad news is that Jerrott Willard, the division's  player of the year last season, and the Johnson brothers -- Warren and Weston  -- have graduated.  </P> <P> KEY TO THE GAME -- Emotion. It is vital for Huntington Beach to play hard while  keeping its desire to show the world it is a good team and was robbed of the  championship last season.  </P> <P> CONSENSUS -- The game would seem to mean more to Huntington Beach. Add the fact  that the Oilers have one of the best teams in the Sunset League and they should  win.  </P></p>

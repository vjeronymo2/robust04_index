In a speech at the outset of a conference on the trade and  economic aspects of developments in Central and East Europe,  which is organized by the Washington-based organization European  Institute, Shifter said that this group would be headed by Under  Secretary of State Peter Tarnoff.    Shifter, who is director for Central and East Europe in the  National Security Council, declared that the formation of this  group was the result of an overall revision of U.S. foreign  policy carried out after the accession of Bill Clinton's  administration. Following this analysis of foreign policy, it  was decided that special attention must be paid to Central and  East Europe, Shifter said, and stressed the significance of the  success of political and democratic reforms in this region for  the United States.    At the same time, he drew attention to the fact that no new  financial resources from the U.S. budget could be expected in  support of cooperation with Central and East Europe. The main  issue is how to make optimal use of existing funds, Shifter  said, and stressed, in particular, support of the private sector.    The decision to form the group for Central and East Europe  was made about two weeks ago and is to meet for the first time  within the next few days, Richard Shifter told CTK.    All important departments of the U.S. Administration will be  represented in this group, including the Departments of State,  Defense, Energy, and Agriculture.    The conference on Central and East Europe organized by the  European Institute is attended also by Czech Minister of  Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] plans  to send a delegation of its Diet members to North Korea in June.  This was revealed by SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo in an  interview with SANKEI SHIMBUN on 25 May. If the plan is  realized, the party will ask North Korea to refrain from  engaging in its alleged nuclear arms development program. It  will also call for resumption of talks on normalizing Japan-DPRK  relations.    Although the SDPJ has been on friendly terms with the  Workers  Party of Korea, it has stopped sending formal delegations since  last August when it joined the coalition as a member of the  former Hosokawa administration. But since the SPDJ bolted the  coalition and "there are no more restrictions as a ruling party"  (according to a SDPJ official), the SDPJ is now holding informal  negotiations with North Korea on a plan to send a delegation led  by Secretary General Kubo as soon as meetings with President  Kim Il-song and other leaders are arranged.</p>

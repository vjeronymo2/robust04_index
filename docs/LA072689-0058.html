			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MARINE STUDY FINDS BOOT CAMP STRESS DIDN'T CAUSE 3 SUICIDES  </P> <P> The Marine Corps Recruit Depot's commanding officer Tuesday released findings  showing that the stress and pressure of boot camp were not the cause of three  recruit suicides in 1988.  </P> <P> The results of a three-month suicide study were released at a press conference  called by Brig. Gen. Frank J. Breth, who assumed command of the Marine Corps  Recruit Depot one month before the last recruit died of a self-inflicted bullet  wound Dec. 1, 1988. Another Marine recruit also shot himself to death July 1,  and a third hanged himself March 16, 1988.  </P> <P> Breth said he was disturbed by the deaths and commissioned a special task force  to study the causes, means and prevention of recruit suicides at MCRD.  According to the panel's findings, "the pressure and stress of boot camp did  not cause any of the recent suicides."  </P> <P> "Accordingly, there is no reason to radically change training in an effort to  prevent recruit suicides," said the report.  </P> <P> However, the study also said that the "controlled and stressful (training)  environment was a factor which probably contributed to the end result." In two  of the three suicides, the recruits had received "Dear John" letters before  their deaths, but the report said there was "no common pattern or facts linking  the recent suicides."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Increasing Phenomenon'  </P> <P> However, one similarity noted in the report was that, in each death, the  recruit told other recruits or relatives that he was contemplating suicide. But  this information was not made available to drill instructors or other Marine  officials in time to prevent the suicide, according to Col. C. W. Cheatham, who  headed the task force.  </P> <P> The task force reported that suicide among young adults is an "increasing  phenomenon" in society that is becoming acceptable as a "way out of perplexing  problems." The report said "it would be naive to believe that we in the Marine  Corps can escape this attitude completely."  </P> <P> The task force examined the cases of 188 recruits who were discharged from 1987  to date for "suicidal ideation." The panel found that most of the men were  "malingerers" and not serious suicide threats. Instead, they threatened to kill  themselves because "these were young men who were very out of place here and  wished to go home," the report said.  </P> <P> Figures released by the Corps showed that there have been eight suicides at  MCRD since 1970 and 39 deaths from all causes. Two of the three suicides in  1988 occurred at Camp Pendleton firing ranges. The report also cited a  "near-fatal paralysis" resulting from an incident last year at a Camp Pendleton  range, but did not say if it sprang from a suicide attempt or accidental  shooting.  </P> <P> The panel that put together the report was composed entirely of military  officials, including a psychiatrist, psychologist, chaplain and a drill  instructor.  </P> <P> Although the report found no reason to change the training at the MCRD in order  to minimize the chances of suicide, it appeared to find at least one fault with  the present system. The report noted that a suicidal recruit may only ask for  help once "because of the system in recruit training . . . then internalize his  feelings until the opportunity arises for suicide."  </P> <P> The panel suggested several recommendations to prevent suicides, including  teaching drill instructors and recruits to look for certain "warning signs."  Recruits should also be allowed to "relax" during their free time, the report  said, and said that too many "training and administrative details" now cut into  recruits' free time. Recruiters now use a screening list to weed out recruits  who might be suicidal, said Breth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 25,000 Recruits a Year  </P> <P> About 25,000 recruits each year go through MCRD, which has been training  Marines since 1923.  </P> <P> In another development, Breth and Col. Regan R. Wright, also told the press  conference that Marine Corps officials will fight any attempts by the Port  District to expand Lindbergh Field north to the base. Expanding Lindbergh Field  is one option being studied by the to modernize San Diego's airport. Others  include moving it to two sites near Miramar Naval Air Station and to Brown  Field, near Otay Mesa.  </P> <P> "We don't believe that MCRD is the answer," Breth said. '. . . We are concerned  about encroachment. Historically, we have given a lot to San Diego, but there  is no more left."  </P> <P> When MCRD was established, it covered 800 acres. But, since 1937, the Marines  have ceded most of the original tract to the city and Port District. Today, the  training depot covers only 388 acres and one training area borders a Lindbergh  Field runway.  </P> <P> "We don't have any property to give up for airport expansion," Wright said.  </P> <P> If the Port District wants MCRD, it would have to wield political muscle in  Congress, said Breth, because the Corps will not give it up voluntarily. Some  supporters of expansion have said the recruit depot could easily be moved to  sprawling Camp Pendleton.  </P> <P> But Breth said it would cost at least $1 billion to open a new facility at Camp  Pendleton. He said MCRD is an economic boon for San Diego because it generates  millions in income for the city from visitors who come to see the base museum  and visit the recruits.  </P></p>

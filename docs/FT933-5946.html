			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Opening of Thai motorway ordered A THAI court has ordered that a controversial Dollars 1bn (Pounds 660m) motorway be opened today, without having solved bitter disputes with the international consortium which has a 30-year concession to build and operate it. Mr Sukavich Rangsitpol, the governor of the state-run Expressway and Rapid Transit Authority, succeeded in obtaining a court order citing the consortium's breach of contract and bad faith. Mr Takao Ninomiya, the managing director of Bangkok Expressway (BECL), the consortium led by Japan's Kumagai Gumi, said he was 'astonished, very surprised. We have only a few hours remaining. We are a private company with no power, no police, no army. . . we cannot resist them if this is what they want.' The move to force open the Second Stage Expressway, through the middle of the capital, surprised and dismayed financiers. Some warned it might alienate international investors just when Thailand is hoping to tap them for a massive upgrading of its national infrastructure. Mr Sukavich said foreign bankers had 'only' put in Dollars 100m compared to local bankers' Dollars 700m so the move would have no effect on future financing 'as long as they understand why we are doing this. I'm not forcing anything. . . We will continue to negotiate afterwards.' BECL has said the almost complete toll road should not open until the row over the interpretation of the complex project finance contract signed in 1988 is resolved. The Thai authorities appear to have finally conceded it should charge the original Bt30 (Dollars 1.20) toll per vehicle agreed in the contract rather than the Bt20 more acceptable to Bangkok motorists. But BECL says it is owed some Bt2bn in backdated revenues and is sceptical about the transport authority's ability to adhere to the agreement for the remaining 27 years of the concession.</p>

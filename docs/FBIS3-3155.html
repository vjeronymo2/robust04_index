			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Cary Huang, China editor, and Shiny Li in Beijing] </F>   [Text] Financial troubleshooter Zhu Rongji's tough  measures to crack down on speculative activities by China's  state-run banks have failed. An investigation by the State  Audit Administration reveals up to 90 per cent of bankers have  refused to carry out the vice-premier's rectification policy to  stop them setting up businesses. They were the major target of  Mr Zhu's rectification policy introduced last June.    The report said many state-run banks and their branches were  unwilling to separate their linkage with businesses invested and  owned by them due to huge interests and complicated legal,  economic and practical problems. "Banking institutions and  their affiliated businesses are closely tied together for  interests," a banking official said. "Firms are dependent on  banks to supply capital and banks rely on firms for huge profits  which are much higher than returns by banking business  activities."    China's state-run banks have been widely involved in  businesses, especially in speculation in the country's fledgling  stock and property markets. Their activities have caused  widespread corruption and overheating following Beijing's rush  to embrace a capitalistic economy. Mr Zhu, also governor of the  People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, launched the  rectification campaign to wipe out the malpractices.    The State Audit Administration says branches of the People's  Bank of China, Industrial and Commercial Bank, Agricultural Bank  and Construction Bank in a central China province had not cut  links with all of the 757 bank-affiliated businesses owned by  them. Chinese sources said the result by the investigation  would greatly embarrass Mr Zhu who vowed to get rid of the  practice when being appointed central bank governor last June.    Meanwhile, a senior banking official said Beijing would give  more generous terms to Hong Kong and Taiwan banks than foreign  banks in setting up business on the mainland. "Anyway, they  (Hong Kong and Taiwan) are parts of our nation," said Dai  Shanglong, referring to requirements for overseas banks to set  their branches in China.    Chinese regulations require a foreign bank to have assets of  above US$10 billion (HK$78 billion) to set up a representative  office. The office should have been established three years and  the bank have assets over US$20 billion before it can apply to  set up a branch. Mr Dai said Beijing would ease this term for  banks from Hong Kong and Taiwan. However, he hinted that China  was unlikely to open its yuan business to foreign banks.    According to Mr Dai, China can completely open the Chinese  yuan business to foreign bankers only when the following three  basic requirements are met:    -- Specialised state-run banks should be restructured into  real commercial banks and policy-banking activities should be  separated from business ones in these banks to enable them to  compete with their foreign counterparts on an equal footing;    -- As many banks are granting policy loans to help  enterprises in the red to help maintain social stability, and so  long as state-run firms are not restructured into self  responsible businesses to enable banks to release the burden, it  is improper for China to open its currency market to foreign  bankers;    -- China should unify its corporate tax rates for all banks  to create an equal footing for competition as Beijing now  provides various tax rates, with 15 per cent for foreign banks  in Special Economic Zones, 30 per cent for foreign banks in  opening cities while charging 55 per cent for staterun banks.    Mr Dai said Beijing could approve some foreign banks to  operate yuan business in some regions on a trial basis.</p>

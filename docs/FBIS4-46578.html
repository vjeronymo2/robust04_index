He is the author of more than  100 scientific works and inventions.    In February 1993, V.D. Pilyugin delivered a report on  the problems of ecology in the Russian Federation Armed Forces  at the NATO SSAS [not found] Committee in Brussels.    In the Soviet Union, Ministry of Defense ranges occupied 30  million hectares and 42 million hectares were allocated for  various military facilities. Furthermore, in the process of  daily activities and the conduct of military exercises, the  Armed Forces operate on areas that significantly exceed these  limits. At the present time, a substantial portion of this  territory remains within the jurisdiction of the Russian  Ministry of Defense. Some ranges are located outside the borders  of the Russian Federation, primarily on the territory of  Kazakhstan.    Military activity in peacetime is one of the types of  housekeeping-economic activities that is associated with a  heightened risk of unfavorable impacts on the environment and  man. This activity proceeds from the priority of the state's  military security and therefore ecological violations are  fundamentally permitted in some cases. The Armed Forces are a  source of negative impact on the environment, based upon the  specific nature of their activities, saturation with complex  weapons systems and military equipment, and the employment of  energy-intensive technologies in everyday life. Military  facilities discharge harmful substances into the air during  launches of various types of missiles, flights of aircraft and  housekeeping activities (boilers, kitchens, etc.) Furthermore,  the Armed Forces are saturated with motor vehicle transportation  and, in the meantime, we have calculated that they cause  approximately 70% of all harmful discharges into the  atmosphere. So, during a 24-hour period, a carburetor engine  emits as much carbon gases as a man during his entire lifetime.    During the daily activities of the troops, reservoirs and  soil become polluted and a significant portion of the pollution  occurs due to uncontrolled wastes and poor collection of  everyday wastes.    There are a significant number of nuclear reactors in the  Armed Forces, especially in the Navy. Radioactive contamination  of the environment occurs during the operation of reactors, when  maintenance work is conducted on them, and when they are removed  from operation. Leaks and spills of various highly toxic  substances, primarily missile engine fuel, are a source of  pollution. The electromagnetic radiation of powerful radio and  radar sites and other sources of radiation inflict enormous  damage to the environment. The extent of that damage to the  environment has still not been completely determined.    So, the daily activities of troops inflict ecological damage  to the environment. However, civilian departments, and their  numerous enterprises that are not equipped with the required  cleaning equipment for various reasons, frequently conduct  dumping and emit harmful substances and in many cases these  departments are attempting to accuse the Armed Forces of the  harm that has been caused to the environment. Right now Russia  has especially had to encounter this phenomenon when troops are  being withdrawn from other states. The governments of these  states are demanding enormous compensation from Russia for the  damage caused to the environment and there frequently is no  evidence that the damage was caused by our troops.    At the same time, I need to point out that the Armed Forces  have the scientific-technical, material and production potential  that is capable of making a substantial contribution to  ecological security, including for the creation of ecological  monitoring. The Ecology and Special Protective Systems  Directorate, which is called upon to precisely determine the  environmental situation in the Armed Forces and ways to improve  it, was created in the Russian Ministry of Defense in August  1992.    Environmental protection structures previously existed in  the  Armed Forces. The inspectorate for Protection of the Environment  was created eight years ago under the Rear Services of the Armed  Forces and inspectorates and inspectors were introduced into the  Armed Forces services, military districts and fleets. However,  their activities were practically reduced to monitoring  functions.    In accordance with the Statute approved by the RF Minister  of  Defense in February of this year, the Ecology and Special  Protective Systems Directorate was tasked with overall  management and monitoring of environmental activity in the  Russian Armed Forces and also with the organization and  coordination of work for the creation and employment in the  Armed Forces of special (medical, veterinary, chemical and  technical) systems to protect the troops from the impact of  unfavorable environmental factors during the course of everyday  troop activities and in emergency situations. An RF Council of  Ministers Chairman Directive founded the Ministry of Defense  Ecological Center, that was created by the Ecology and Special  Protective Systems Directorate in May 1993, to form and develop  Armed Forces ecological support systems.    The following are the Ecology Directorate's primary  missions:  formation and development of the RF Armed Forces ecological  support system; management and monitoring of the activity of the  ecological organs of the Armed Forces services, branches of  troops, military districts, fleets, and RF Ministry of Defense  directorates; implementation of cooperation with state  environmental protection organs; formation of a  scientific-technical policy and organization of the conduct of  research and development on the problems of military ecology;  and, organization of a system of ecological training and  education in the army and navy.    The Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate is a  central organ of the RF Ministry of Defense military directorate  and is subordinate to the chief of the RF Armed Forces General  Staff. The Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate  developed the RF Armed Forces Ecological Support Concept, in  which a system of views, primary directions and practical  missions in this sphere is reflected, to ensure a comprehensive  and weighty approach to the reduction of the negative impact of  military activity on the environment. The Concept, which has  been approved by the RF Armed Forces Chief of the General Staff,  proposes the mandatory accounting of economic aspects in all  elements of the RF Armed Forces structural development system.    An objective assessment of the ecological situation in the  army and navy and the discovery of areas of heightened  ecological tension is one of the Directorate's priority  missions. Right now we are continuing the ecological passport  system [pasportizatsiya] of military facilities and territories  and we are conducting the formation of an ecological measures  plan and a research and development program for 1994. As of  today, the passport system has been conducted at approximately  20% of military units.    Work has begun on the creation of an Armed Forces automated  ecological monitoring system which will become one of the  elements of the Russian Federal Ecomonitoring System.    An RF Presidential Directive has approved the procedures for  inventorying locations and extraction facilities,  transportation, and the collection and burial of radioactive  substances and wastes that have been developed in the  Directorate. An organizational diagram and the procedures for  conducting this work in the Armed Forces have been defined.    We are preparing proposals on the formation of ecological  organs and subunits ("green helmets") based upon existing Armed  Forces structures and services, military districts and fleets.  The ecological organs and subunits will be tasked with the  resolution of practical missions for protecting and restoring  the environment at ground and naval forces deployment and combat  training areas. In the process, we plan to utilize the  experience of work of nonorganic detachments for the elimination  of the consequences of the Russian troop stay in Germany and the  Baltic republics, and also similar subunits that have been  created in the armies of the United States and Western Europe.    A great deal of attention will be devoted to the  organization  of expanded ecological training of officers at military  educational institutions and the development of ecological  training and education in the troops.    In its activity, the Directorate is proceeding from the fact  that putting in order and normalizing the ecological situation  in the Armed Forces is first of all a matter for the Armed  Forces themselves. In order to achieve that, we need:    a) A team of people that will be specially involved with the  ecology in the army and navy. To do this, we have created the  Ecology and Special Protective Systems Directorate and the  Ecological Center and we are beginning to form a system of  ecological organs in military districts, armies, fleets, etc.  Furthermore, we are creating special ecological subunits which  will conduct recultivation and other restoration work on  territories allotted to the Ministry of Defense. It's possible  that these subunits will be created outside Armed Forces  strength standards or by reducing the army and navy, possibly --  on the principles of alternative service;    b) within the framework of all state ecological programs,  such as "Russia's Ecological Security", "Conversion -- Ecology",  and others, the appropriate portion of the resources must  provide for the needs of the Armed Forces.    During the formation of various ecological funds, including  funds from the employment of tax sanctions, a definite portion  of the resources must be transferred to the Ministry of Defense  to conduct environmental protection measures.    A separate article to conduct environmental protection  activity must be provided for within the framework of the  defense budget; and,    c) A system of ecological training and education in the  Armed  Forces.    In recent years, the RF Ministry of Defense has done quite a  bit of work to provide public services and amenities at military  garrisons and to transform polluted areas into troop deployment  areas. For example, dozens of complexes for the complete  biological treatment of sewage with a total output (capacity) of  more than 20,000 cubic meters per day were built in the areas  adjacent to the Scandinavian countries, that is, toward the  Baltic Sea, on the Kola Peninsula, in Kareliya and Arkhangelsk  Oblast which had a positive impact on the state of surface and  ground waters in this region. I need to note that environmental  protection work was carried out more intensively on the  territory of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. So, water treatment  facilities were built at a number of garrisons there.    In Baltic and Northern Fleet garrisons, the total capacity  of  water treatment plants has been increased by more than 5,000  cubic meters per day in recent years. Reequipping surface  combatants and ships with separators to clean water containing  oil and also systems for their collection has been completed in  these fleets. We are conducting the systematic installation of a  new type of waste oil collection systems to clean petroleum  products and floating garbage from water areas. There are boom  barriers in constant readiness in each fleet. They plan to build  additional coastal sites to clean up water that contains oil.    In recent years, special attention has been devoted to  improving public services and amenities of fleets of motor  vehicles and other military vehicles and to equipping them with  washracks with circulating water supply systems with  gasoline-grease recovery devices. Work is being continuously  conducted to ensure ecological safety during the operation of  petroleum-oil-lubricants [POL] depots and facilities, and motor  vehicle and construction equipment refueling and servicing  locations.    The above listed environmental protection measures are  mainly  being carried out through the efforts of the troops themselves  without the involvement of specialized construction  organizations.    The availability of auxiliary support services in the troops  is a specific feature of the everyday activities of our Armed  Forces. As a result, problems arise with the maintenance of  sanitary procedures on the territory of these services. Existing  boiler facilities that were built in the troops according to  typical designs are far from perfect from the point of view of  ecology. As a rule, cleaning harmful combustion products from  smoke gases is inadequate. Cleaning gases is mainly conducted in  dust extractors and only solid particles are removed from these  gases. The resolution of this problem will require significant  material resources, effort, and time and will largely depend on  the heat-engineering equipment that is being employed and  developed.    In the RF Armed Forces, attention is also being devoted to  the protection, reproduction and rational utilization of forest  resources. The volumes and areas for cutting down forests for  the needs of the army and navy are being continuously reduced.  In Kareliya, Murmansk and Arkhangelsk oblasts alone, the volume  of logging has been reduced by one million cubic meters per  year, that is, by more than half, since 1975. Forest restoration  work is being mandatorily conducted on all cut down areas and  the planting of valuable breeds of timber is being conducted.  So, in 1992, tree planting was conducted on approximately 3,500  hectares in this region. In 1990, we terminated drift floating  of timber that was being conducted in Arkhangelsk Oblast because  it had a negative impact on the state of the rivers.    Under the new sociopolitical conditions and under the  fundamental restructuring of the entire state structure,  including in the army, the resolution of urgent ecological  problems of military activity is unthinkable without a unified  State Scientific-Technical Program which would determine the  primary directions and research tasks, the procedures and time  periods for accomplishing work, the composition of the  executors, the volumes and sources of financing, coordination  and the exchange of experience in international cooperation,  training and education of cadres.    The conduct and implementation of ecological programs in  Europe, and in the entire world, will require the united efforts  of all countries, including former potential enemies, which in  turn will permit us to accelerate the overall process of the  transition to international relations from confrontation and an  indifferent attitude toward mutual cooperation.    In our opinion, we need to begin international cooperation  with:    1. Coordination of the norms and standards on all aspects of  ecological problems;    2. Organization of an international warning and notification  system and elimination of the aftereffects of major accidents  and catastrophes at ecologically dangerous facilities that are  accompanied by ecological consequences on regional, national or  cross-border scales; and.    3. With cooperation in scientific-technical policy.</p>

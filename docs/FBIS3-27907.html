"I know well that you've contributed much to the  democratization process in your country," Kim told her, "and I  gave my spiritual support to your democratization movement at  the time. I was also in the democratization movement in Korea  and I know well the difficulties you must have had in that  movement."    Noting that some 15,000 Philippine workers are in Korea now,  Kim said he had instructed the cabinet to take steps to improve  working conditions of foreign workers to the level of those for  domestic workers, including a step for foreign workers to  benefit from the industrial accident insurance system,  Chongwadae Spokesman Chu Ton-sik said.    "Our trade with China has exceeded the  10-billion-U.S.-dollar  mark, though we established diplomatic relations only two years  ago," Kim said, "but the trade between Korea and the Philippines  is slow in growth, compared with a long history of relations  between the two countries."    The former Philippine president said she would tell  President  Fidel Ramos to take measures for increased trade with South  Korea and asked for special consideration of Philippine workers,  as there would be more and more foreign workers in Korea in the  future.    When Kim thanks her for Philippine support in the Korean  war,  she said her husband, the late Sen. Aquino, had been a war  correspondent during the war, and added, "because of this he won  many votes in elections."    Many leaders of the world consider President Kim's political  reforms as a model for them, she told Kim.</p>

			<p>940715 FT  15 JUL 94 / Arts: Will the axe fall on Aix? - The festival is facing the biggest crisis in its 46-year history A beautiful old town, perfect summer weather, traditional Provencal food, a relaxed atmosphere and good music: welcome to Aix-en-Provence, where the 1994 festival opens tonight with Die Zauberflote. It is the sort of festival environment which north Europeans can only dream about, and helps explain why Aix attracts a large, faithful clientele. But this year is different. France's premier music festival is facing the biggest crisis in its 46-year history. The programme has shrunk to just one opera production and 12 concerts - a stark contrast to the boom years when 60 events were normal. The deficit stands at more than FFr10m (Pounds 1.2m). There are no sponsors. As if these ills were not enough, a backstage accident in May damaged Aix's open-air theatre. The festival blames its problems on the recession and says the French government is doing nothing to help. 'We want to stay in the club of international festivals, renowned for quality and innovation,' says the administrative director, Herve Grillet. 'We have a strong image abroad. But the government doesn't want to acknowledge this. Provence is far from Paris, and in a centralised state, that's not good for us.' This year's FFr26m budget was only drawn up in January and represents a 30 per cent cut. Grillet points out that while the government subsidises the Paris Opera to the tune of FFr500m, it refuses to raise its grant to Aix above FFr5m. Double this would barely dent the nation's culture budget, but would make a crucial difference to Aix. For its part, the government says the festival's deficit is the result of poor financial controls and declining artistic appeal. 'If we give more money, we want to know the festival will reach a wider range of people,' says Stephane Martin, director of music at the ministry of culture. 'In its present form, Aix is expensive and elitist.' Martin said each festival performance this summer was being supported by FFr225,000 of government money. 'Aix doesn't have a public funding problem - we've actually increased the subsidy. The problem is the artistic side. The festival needs to reduce its dependence on opera, raise its volume of activity and develop ideas which will interest the public.' Behind Aix's current disarray lies an illustrious history. The festival was founded in 1948, with Gabriel Dussurget as artistic director and Hans Rosbaud as chief conductor. From the start, Mozart was a pillar of the repertory, augmented by Haydn, Monteverdi, Gluck, Rossini, Rameau and Strauss. Thanks to Dussurget's talent-spotting, some of the best-known singers of the postwar era began their international careers at Aix. The festival became the French equivalent of Glyndebourne or Salzburg. Since 1981 the artistic director has been Louis Erlo, who also runs the Opera de Lyon. Although musical standards have remained high, the festival seems to have lost its way. Encouraged by a Socialist victory in local council elections in 1989, Erlo changed the festival's statutes and expanded the budget. The assumption was that France's Socialist government would raise its subsidy and sponsorship would increase. However, the culture minister at the time, Jack Lang, was unimpressed with Erlo's policies, and the recession chased away sponsors. The deficit began to mount. The election of a centre-right government last year only widened the gulf between Aix and Paris. It now looks as if the festival will have to await the result of next year's presidential and local elections before its future can be resolved. If the centre-right wins the presidency and regains control of the Aix council, more money should be available. It would also speed up the appointment of a successor to Erlo, whose contract expires in 1996. Most observers agree the festival needs an injection of new blood. 'The programme is not what you would expect from a festival which charges a top price of FFr890,' commented a senior figure in the French opera establishment. 'If you charge that much, you expect a more imaginative choice of repertoire, and artists who are more appealing.' But for the time being, Erlo's position is secure. He has retained the support of influential local figures such as Mme Edmonde Charles-Roux, owner of the newspaper Le Provencal. The Aix council has agreed to service the deficit and look after the theatre, specially constructed each summer in the courtyard of the archbishop's palace. This year's festival may look skimpy, but most visitors come for the place as much as the programme - the special Provencal light immortalised by Cezanne, the balmy climate, the cobbled squares and, of course, the sound of Mozart wafting through the air.</p>

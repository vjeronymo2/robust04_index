			<p><P> April 12, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE ALLEGED 'BAG MAN' FOR SILBERMAN SURRENDERS  </P> <P> A former security guard for a Westlake Village stock brokerage firm surrendered  Tuesday in San Diego to federal authorities, who allege that he helped Richard  T. Silberman launder $300,000 from an undercover agent who had described the  money as coming from Colombian cocaine traffickers.  </P> <P> Darryl Nakatsuka of Los Angeles -- portrayed by FBI agents as a "bag man" in a  money-laundering operation allegedly orchestrated by Silberman -- surrendered  at U.S. District Court at 2 p.m., accompanied by Los Angeles attorney Robert L.  Shapiro.  </P> <P> U.S. Magistrate Roger Curtis McKee allowed Nakatsuka to remain free on a  $200,000 personal surety bond co-signed by his father and secured by a family  home in Los Angeles. Prosecutors did not oppose his release and Nakatsuka was  directed to return to court for a preliminary hearing April 21.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nakatsuka 'Surprised'  </P> <P> In a brief interview, Nakatsuka said he was "surprised" when friends called him  Friday night and told him he was being sought by the FBI.  </P> <P> "I was at the office on Friday when I heard," said Nakatsuka, a slight man  dressed Tuesday in a stylish gray-striped suit and white shirt. "I didn't know  what to think. . . . I really don't know anything about this."  </P> <P> Nakatsuka, who described himself as director of security for Hamilton-Williams  &amp; Co. stock brokerage firm in Westlake Village, north of Los Angeles, said  he was acquainted with Jack Norman Myers, who is among four individuals charged  in the alleged money-laundering scheme and was still at large late Tuesday.  </P> <P> But he declined to comment on his ties to Silberman and the charges against  him.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Silberman -- the husband of County Supervisor Susan Golding and a  longtime fund-raiser for statewide and local Democratic candidates -- resigned  Tuesday as director and officer of Yuba Natural Resources Inc., a company  principally involved in gold mining with land holdings north of Sacramento.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Chairman Elected  </P> <P> At a special meeting, the company's board of directors formed a committee to  investigate Yuba's potential involvement in the alleged scheme and elected  Peter L. Jensen chairman of the board  </P> <P> and chief executive officer. A company spokesman declined any specific comment  on the case.  </P> <P> Silberman, 59, was arrested Friday at the Hyatt Islandia hotel while allegedly  negotiating to launder $1.1 million in funds an undercover agent told him were  proceeds from Colombian cocaine sales. His arrest -- which was videotaped --  capped a 2 1/2-year investigation by FBI agents who stumbled upon Silberman  while trailing Chris Petti, a reputed organized crime figure.  </P> <P> Petti, 62, an alleged associate of the Chicago La Cosa Nostra crime family and  once convicted of bookmaking, was also arrested Friday. Both Petti -- who is  being held without bail -- and Silberman face charges of conspiracy, money  laundering and violating laws requiring all transactions involving sums  exceeding $10,000 be reported to the federal government. They could be  sentenced to 20 years in prison if convicted.  </P> <P> A 76-page federal affidavit released Monday provided a rich, detailed look at  the case against Silberman, a powerful political figure who was once a close  adviser to former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. The document, filed in support of  search warrants, is based on six months of wiretapped telephone conversations  and meetings between the undercover FBI agent and Silberman.  </P> <P> Prosecutors charge that Silberman asked Petti -- whom he allegedly has known  for 15 years -- to help arrange a money-laundering deal in mid-1988. Silberman  boasted that he had laundered money in the past and sought new connections from  Petti because he wanted "some diversification," the affidavit says.  </P> <P> "This is not my first go-around," Silberman is quoted in the affidavit as  telling the agent. "I've been here before."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Transactions Described  </P> <P> The affidavit describes two laundering transactions between the FBI agent and  Silberman, who stood to earn a commission of between 6% and 12% on each of the  alleged deals.  </P> <P> The first, on Nov. 30, involved $100,000 picked up by Nakatsuka at the Airport  Hilton in Los Angeles. Those funds were apparently to be used in a stock swap  involving Yuba American Gold, a subsidiary of Yuba Natural Resources, though  prosecutors say specifics of the deal remain murky.  </P> <P> On Feb. 22, the second deal occurred when another $200,000 in federal money was  given by the undercover agent to Myers and Nakatsuka at the Hyatt Islandia. The  two men indicated in conversations with the agent that they had done such work  for Silberman before. That money was exchanged for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon  bonds through an employee of the Hamilton-Williams stock brokerage house, Terry  Ziegler.  </P> <P> Transcripts of wiretapped conversations between Silberman and the agent suggest  Silberman believed the money came from Colombian drug traffickers, who,  according to the cover story provided by the agent, needed it hidden in  investments in the United States. The affidavit alleges that Silberman  frequently asked the agent not to mention the word "drugs" or "cocaine" in  their discussions.  </P> <P> Under federal law, a person need not be laundering actual drug money to be  convicted. Silberman needed only to believe its source was narcotics  trafficking to be charged, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Case Called 'Very Strong'  </P> <P> Evidence against the powerful political fund-raiser, a La Jolla resident whose  wealth was once estimated at as much as $25 million, ranges from the extensive  wiretap transcripts to videotapes of the cash transactions. Prosecutors have  characterized the case against him as "very strong." A grand jury indictment is  expected within 10 days.  </P> <P> Nakatsuka, whose role as described in the affidavit appeared limited to cash  pickups and deliveries, worked as a security guard at the Hamilton-Williams  stock brokerage firm but quit last week, a broker there said Tuesday. The  company, located on Triunfo Canyon Road, changed its name to Adams Securities  about a week ago, prosecutors said.  </P> <P> Ziegler -- who allegedly set up the purchase of bonds in the second laundering  transaction -- was a "part-time analyst" for Hamilton-Williams until he quit  last week, said the broker, who declined to give his name. Ziegler has not been  charged but remains the target of a federal investigation.  </P> <P> Asked to comment on the allegations involving the brokerage house, the broker  said, "Nothing went through this firm."  </P> <P> An FBI spokesman said Myers was negotiating for his surrender. The spokesman  said he believed Myers was being represented by attorney Howard Weitzman, who  defended John Z. Delorean against cocaine-related charges. But Weitzman's  secretary said Weitzman had not been retained.  </P> <P> Sources have said Myers, 43, of Malibu, has been associated with Silberman  since both men raised campaign funds for Brown. Myers is the former son-in-law  of MCA Chairman Lew Wasserman; he and Wasserman's daughter, Lynn, divorced  about 10 years ago.  </P> <P> In San Diego, meanwhile, a spokeswoman for noted criminal defense attorney  Milton J. Silverman said he had not yet decided whether to represent Silberman.  Silverman, who handled the controversial Sagon Penn police shooting case, made  a special appearance for Silberman at his arraignment Monday.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weekend Release  </P> <P> Arrested Friday, Silberman spent the night at the Metropolitan Correctional  Center before his release Saturday on a $500,000 personal surety bond co-signed  by Golding. On Tuesday, some attorneys expressed surprise that a magistrate  agreed to free Silberman over the weekend, while others said it was a common  practice.  </P> <P> "I've never had anybody released on the weekend in 17 years of practicing law,"  said defense attorney Jan Ronis, noting, however, that he had never had a  client "of that stature" arrested on a Friday evening or weekend.  </P> <P> At least one prosecutor, who asked not to be named, also said the procedure had  never been used for a defendant in any of his cases.  </P> <P> Veteran defense attorney John Cleary, however, said he has frequently obtained  the release of clients on Saturdays and Sundays -- including low-income clients  he represented while working for Federal Defenders Inc.  </P> <P> "If the case has merit, and the client can make bail, I don't hesitate," Cleary  said, adding that he has driven to the homes of judges after hours and once  tracked a magistrate to a golf course to obtain the signature needed to permit  the release.  </P> <P> "Usually, they are eminently reasonable about it and understand that people  don't like to sit in jail all weekend if they don't have to," Cleary said. He  noted that prosecutors have a say in the decision and argued that the system is  "heavily weighted in favor of caution."  </P> <P> Magistrate McKee, who arranged Silberman's release at the request of defense  attorney Lou Katz on Saturday, said he has approved weekend releases six or  seven times since the first of this year. He said magistrates serve on a  two-week rotating stint, during which they must be available for nighttime and  weekend requests for release as well as for search warrants.  </P> <P> "In this case, the proposals made sense, so I did it," said McKee, adding that  his primary concern is being assured the person will return to court. "If  someone else had been on duty they would have made the decision."  </P></p>

During an inspection of Shanxi prior to the Spring Festival,  General Secretary Jiang Zemin explicitly pointed out: "The core  issue of rural work at the grass-roots level lies in building up  party branches."    As reform and development enter a new stage in rural areas,  the party and government are guiding and helping hundreds of  millions of peasants to gear their production to markets and to  become prosperous all together. To accomplish this glorious and  yet arduous task, we need tens of thousands of grass-roots rural  party organizations possessing both cohesive power and a  fighting capability, such as the organization in Qiaolicun  village.    The Qiaolicun general party branch's cohesive power and  fighting capability are referred to, to put it in the villagers'  own words, as their political sensitivity, correct ideology,  democratic style, and economic honesty.    Political sensitivity means the party branch's adeptness in  promptly combining the party's general political principles with  local realities and creatively implementing the central  authorities' guidelines as concrete work.    Correct ideology means that party branch members always have  always borne in mind the goal of serving the people  wholeheartedly, constantly caring for the masses, doing  everything for them, placing their interests above anything  else, and willingly sacrificing individual interests when there  is a conflict between individual and collective interests.    Democratic style refers to criticism and self-criticism  conducted periodically within the party branch, especially its  adherence to the line of from the masses to the masses and its  reliance on the masses in doing everything and in making  economic construction and the work in other fields of endeavor  the conscious actions of the masses.    Economic honesty means that party branch members have  inherited and carried forward the fine tradition of being the  first to bear hardships and the last to enjoy comforts, have  upheld the communist outlook on life and value concepts, and  have conscientiously resisted selfishness and money worshipping.    Practice has shown that improved grass-roots organizations  in  rural areas are crucial to implementing the party's principles  and policies, promoting reform and development, and ensuring  social stability in rural areas. Therefore, all localities  should coordinate efforts to continue to improve village-level  organizations, in focusing on party branches. Through improving  their ideology, style, and organization, all village-level  organizations should meet the following requirements: Party  branches should be able to play their role as the core of the  leadership and fighting bastion in a true sense; villagers  committees should be able to exercise their self-governing power  in handling each village's affairs; collective economic  organizations should attain a certain level of economic strength  for bringing into play their function of serving farm  households; and other village-level organizations should  effectively do their duties and carry out their work. By so  doing, the economic and social outlooks in rural areas will  undergo even greater changes. Qiaolicun village has already  provided us with its successful experience.</p>

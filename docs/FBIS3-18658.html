			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Michele Kambas] </F>   [Text] A Limassol car bomb yesterday blasted two vehicles  and blew in the windows of a house.    But the early morning bomb injured no-one.    It exploded under the car of Andreas Kharalambous who had  parked outside his home.    The home-made dynamite bomb extensively damaged  Kharalambous'  Metro and his daughter's car which was parked nearby.    The windows of his house were also smashed in the explosion  which could be heard all over Limassol.    Kharalambous is chief health inspector for the Limassol  municipality.    He had no idea who was responsible for the attack, adding  that he had no differences with anyone and had never been  threatened.    But police spokesman Andreas Kariolaimos said officers were  investigating whether the attack could have been due to  professional differences.    Other police sources said suspicions are aimed at one  specific person working with Kharalambous.    Attempts to secure an arrest warrant against the suspect  have  failed, said the source, due to insufficient evidence.</p>

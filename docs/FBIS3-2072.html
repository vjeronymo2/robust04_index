			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Xu Hong (1776 3126), Wang Jiabin (3769 0163 </F> 2430): "China Aerospace Industry Seeks Extensive International  Cooperation"]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Feb (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE) -- China  Aerospace Industry Corporation [CAIC] today presented 93  projects, which require a total investment of $1.28 billion, for  extensive international economic and technological cooperation.    A person in charge of the CAIC announced at this evening's  news briefing that the corporation, now hallmarked by its Long  March rocket series undertaking the launching of foreign  satellites, is moving toward the outside world in a fresh  manner. This year, the corporation will hold four large  exhibitions and international cooperation meetings in Chicago,  Melbourne, Kuala Lumpur, and Beijing, at which nearly 100  projects of cooperation will be presented.    The CAIC is a scientific and technological industry giant  founded on the basis of the aerospace section of the former  Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics Industry in June 1993.  Through the development over the past 30 years or so, China's  aerospace industry has expanded to a considerable size and  reached considerable sophistication. So far, many models of  strategic and tactical missiles and carrier rockets have been  successfully developed, and a total of 36 aerospace launchings  have been conducted, sending 41 satellites, including five from  abroad, into outer space. At the moment, the development of  China's Dongfanghong-3 telesat, Fengyun-2 meteorological  satellite, and Ziyuan-1 resource satellite is making smooth  progress and the first two satellites will be launched and go  into operation soon. A prototype of the Long March rocket  series is being developed, and the products in this series are  going through systematization, generalization, and  standardization, as a result of which the corporation is now  capable of providing the international market with a wider  spectrum of services. As to satellites, after starting the  exportation of technology and parts, China is striving to  improve its satellite technology and the ratio of satellite  performance to price, in an attempt to be able to export  complete satellites around 2000.    The projects for cooperation presented today cover a number  of areas, such as electronics, machinery and equipment,  automobiles and auto parts, and real estate development. It is  said that the corporation has begun adjusting its product mix  and will soon start developing the following products as part of  the "signature projects" in the development of China's aerospace  products for civil purposes: a satellite information system, a  mobile communications substation series, a global television  transmission system, a satellite digital communications VSAT [as  received] station, an aerospace satellite digital mobile  communications and localizing system, and so on. Digital  control, engineer control [gong kong 1562 2235], robot,  detection radar, special chemical industry, special materials,  and microwave, infrared, and millimeter-wave technlogy will also  be considered key objects of development. Apart from  strengthening cooperation with old and new partners in the above  areas, the CAIC is also willing to expand the scope and size of  cooperation in the following areas: Coinvestment in, or  codevelopment of, such applications as communications, resource,  meteorological, and navigational satellites and various kinds of  scientific experiment satellites; provision of the ground  application systems and equipment for various kinds of  satellites; and the establishment and joint management of a  satellite application system, with the CAIC's satellites and  carrier rockets contributed as its share of investment; and so  on and so forth.    The person in charge of the corporation also answered  questions from reporters. When a foreign reporter asked about  the alleged exportation of M11 missiles by China to Pakistan,  this person replied that the corporation does not have this  missile model at all, so the alleged export of M11 missiles to  Pakistan is pure rumor.</p>

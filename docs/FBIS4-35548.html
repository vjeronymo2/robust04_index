			<p>BFN     [Text] The [Libyan] secretary of the General People's  Committee for Foreign Liaison and International Cooperation  ['Umar Mustafa al-Muntasir] addressed the Non-Aligned  ministerial conference first addendum. The secretary of the  General People's Comvittee for Foreign Liaison and International  Cooperation asserted that since the holding of the 10th summit  conference in Jakarta in 1992, the world has been witnessing  quick and successive developments and changes with long terms  effects on international relations on both regional and  international levels including the non-alignment movement as new  economic and political trends emerge requiring our countries to  study them thoroughly and take the necessary initiatives to deal  with them.    He pointed out that the changes which took place in he world  did not end or lessen the validity of the fundamental principles  and objectives of the movement.    He added "the ideal international order as invisaged by the  founder fathers of our movement is still far from achieving and  that the aspirations of the non-alignment movement countries for  real equality, genuine independence and limited development  continue to clash with the forces who have been accustomed to  achieve their intentions without any due regard for the opinion  and desires of the international community and the U.N  resolutions.    He said against these challenges and the absence of  international balance, the non-alignment movement continue to  represent the appropriate framework for the coordination for the  policy of its members so as to achieve their aspirations, common  action to maintain their sovereign independence and confronting  the tendencies of new domination and the imposition of the will  of the major powers on the whole world.    He added "our movement will not oe able to fulfil its whole  role except through the enhancement of its unity, rejection of  any attempt to marginalize the role of the movement in  international affairs and to work actively to prevent the  establishment of a descriminator of international order which  would serve only the interest of the northern countries at the  expense of the interest of the south. We are required to find  the necessary means and ways to maintain the power of impetus  within the non-alignment movement so as to fulfil its total role  in formulating the new international relations and influence  them in a manner commensurate with its size and its political  and demographic weight and to contribute towards creating a new  multilateral world free from domination and founded on  cooperation, justice, equity, equality and respect for the  sovereignty of other states.    The secretary of the General People's Committe for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation made clear that during the  10th summit of the non-aligned movement, the delegation of the  Great Jamahirya was given tpe opportunity to inform the head of  states of the latest developments in the despute between herself  and the United States of America, Britain and France.    He said "my country expressed deep satisfaction towards the  stance taken by the movement regarding this dispute as the  summit welcomed Libya's acceptance of the Security Council  Resolution 731 and requested the concerned parties to refrain  from any escalation of the crisis and seek to find a peaceful  and just settlement which may safeguard the interest and rights  of all parties in accordance with the norms and principles of  international law and the U.N. charter. Other organizations  took a similar stance and I refer in this respect to the O.A.U.  which adopted in its recent summit in Cairo a decision  expressing her gratitude to the Libyan initiatives to settle the  dispute in a manner which respects the sovereignty of Libya in  accordance to internatinal norms and Libya's acceptance of the  Security Council Resolution 731 and its request to the U.N  Secretary General to set up a [word indistinct] for the  implementation of the resolution. Also the heads of state  expressed their gratitude to Libya's readiness to cooperate with  judicial and legal parties. A similar decision was taken by the  Islamic Conference Organization.    The secretary added "in this respect I would like to refer  the Arab League Resolution No 5373 on 27/3/1994 regarding the  trial of the two suspects at the seat of the International Court  of Justice in The Hague. The resolution urged the Security  Council to take into consideration this new proposal which  represents an approriate basis to finding a peaceful eolution  which may satisfy all the varties and prevent any escalation of  the situation which may highten tension in the region.    The Secretary of the General People's Committee for Foreign  Liaison and International Cooperation said "and here my country  declares once again her acceptance the aforementioned proposal  of the League of Arab States as a practical bases to finding a  final solution to this dispute which is in our opinion enough to  reach a solution if these countries had sicncere intentions and  the firm desire for a solution to this issue.    He added "we are confident that this conference will support  the initiative of the Arab League and urge the Security Council  to respond to it. We rely on the efforts and endeavours of the  non-aligned movement to convience the concerned countries to  accept the proposal of the Arab League and abandon efforts to  impose further sanctions which will only add to the suffering to  the Libyan Arab people and neighbouring peoples who suffered  massive losses as a resultpof the unjust, sanctions of the  Secuirty Council resolutions 748 and 883 and the lifting of  abroagating of these sanctions. The U.N. is one of the biggest  centers for coordinating international which the recent changes  are reflected. However the dominatin of a given geographical  area in the running of the affairs of the organization with the  aim to impose its opinion in various important issues led to a  further [word indistinct] of the developing countries  spear-headed by the non-alignment movement. This emerged  clearly during the debates of the security council on a number  of issues. And there are moves which emerged indeed and warn of  the desire to take similar measures at the U.N. General  Assembly. This shows clearly the danger threatening the  democratic character of the U.N. which has [word indistinct]  since its establishment, safeguarded by the third world  membership and its effective participation in its activities.  These recent developments inside the U.N. are similar to the  crisis facing the non-aligned movement countries. Our movement,  being the biggest international grouping after the U.N., was  able in the past thanks to the balanced democratic debates to  pave the way for the U.N. to take important political, economic  and social resolutions.    The secretary asserted "the member states of the movement  should make sure to play fundamental role in the formulation in  the future U.N. and its restructuring instead of accepting to be  on the fringe of events and for the movement to take all  effective measures to confront the current challenges.    The secretary added "to realize this objective, we have to  seek to enhance the U.N. machinery and redirect its activities  in an effective manner so that all countries will be able to  participate in the process of the decisions taken by the  organization and take part effectively in the multilateral  diplomacy which the U.N. is considered to be its axis and for us  to be able to create a new order founded on freedom, equality,  justike, prosperity and the well being of all mankind.    The secretary refered once again to the injustice of the  so-called veto right within the security council enjoyed by five  countries from a total of 184 member states of the U.N.    He pointed out "unfortunately this privilage was abused in  many circumstances to entrench aggression and terrorizing  smaller nations and the application of double standards in  dealing with many issues affecting the maintenance of peace and  security.    He added "in this respect I would like to stress Section 32  the decision of the Jakarta Summit which asserts the need for  revising this right in conformity with reforming the U.N. and  demand a review of the Security Council membership so as to  reflect the increasing number of the U.N membership and help  finding fairer and more balanced representation of the U.N.  members also I would like to reiterate the report of the  miniserial committee on policy submitted to Jakarta Summit  stressing the need for effective coordination of the stances of  the movement before and after the convening of the General  Assembly especially regarding the issues on which the movement  took decisions. Furthermore, it is necessary for the decisons  taken by the summit and ministerial conferences to reflect their  true effect by members of the movement within the security  council so as to give it the necessary credibility.</p>

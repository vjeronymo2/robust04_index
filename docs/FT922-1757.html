			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Markets: Cheque law brings banks to account - Serious Money A PECULIAR anomaly was ended by the Cheques Act, which came into force this week. Until now, accountholders who crossed their cheques with 'account payee only' in the belief that this made them non-transferable were wasting their ink. Their diligence did not have the force of law and cashiers could ignore the instruction. Now, however, cheques crossed in this way may be paid into the account of the named party only. Save &amp; Prosper was the first to issue cheques already crossed with 'account payee only' last year. It was followed by Nationwide building society and Lloyds and Yorkshire Banks. The act started out as a private member's bill sponsored by Conal Gregory, then MP for York, with the backing of the Consumers' Association. Its main intention was to protect accountholders from fraud. The Consumers' Association says few people realised that their cheques could be intercepted in the post and paid into an account other than the intended person's with no more than a signature on the back. Fraudsters would not even have to worry about forging the payee's signature accurately since the bank into which it was paid would not have bothered to check its authenticity. Under the Cheques Act, any bank that accepts wrongly a crossed cheque for a third party account is now responsible for the costs of correcting the error. This is excellent news for customers. Bank and credit card fraud have been increasing, partly reflecting the large number of plastic cards and bank accounts held by the British. According to a study called European Retail Banking 1992, to be published next week by Datamonitor, the market analyst, the British have the highest number of accounts in Europe, with 2.4 per head. And even though 17 per cent of Britons have no bank account, compared with only 3 per cent in Switzerland, more Britons have a cheque book and plastic cards than other Europeans. Unless they have been clearly negligent, it is unfair that individual customers, rather than banks, should have to bear the cost of bank and credit card frauds although the balance has been swinging more in favour of the customer recently. Under the Code of Banking Practice issued at the end of last year, which sets out minimum standards for the industry, the onus is now on banks to prove in disputes over card transactions that it was used by the customer. Banks must also comply with the wishes of customers who do not wish to use their cheque cards to draw money from cash machines. In such cases, personal identification numbers will not be issued so that stolen cards cannot be used to withdraw cash. More a declaration of goodwill than a document aimed at setting the world ablaze, the code should nevertheless improve the quality of services offered to the customer. For example, banks have said they will no longer pass on information about their wealthier customers to their insurance and financial subsidiaries so the clients can be targeted for direct mail advertising. Now, the banks will need the customer's consent in order to send him junk mail. These are small steps but they are in the right direction. Other measures that banks and building societies should take to improve services would be to streamline tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) to remove the myriad penalties and bonuses that have made it increasingly difficult to compare the performance of one Tessa with another. In a recent report, the Office of Fair Trading expressed concern that Tessas were the first deposit-based products to have concealed costs in a manner similar to those on life products. Tessas were meant to be straightforward, easily-transferable products and the complications that banks and building societies have brought in go against the spirit of the legislation which introduced them. The OFT report also called for changes to the financial limits on compensation to consumers which, it said, varied 'without rhyme or reason.' Under the protection scheme for the building societies, savers are entitled to compensation of 90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 in their accounts. Yet accountholders at banks, which are more liable to collapse than building societies, are entitled to compensation of only 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 under the deposit protection scheme. This is an anomaly that could well do with being remedied. Because of opposition from the banks, the code did not include a requirement for them to tell customers in discontinued accounts that these had been replaced with similar accounts, usually offering better rates. Customers with 90-day accounts find themselves locked into their old accounts before being able to switch. Both the Cheques Act and the Code of Banking Practice were the outcome of laborious negotiations between consumer groups and the banks. Consumer pressure will still be needed to ensure that further steps are taken to improve the services of the banks and building societies.</p>

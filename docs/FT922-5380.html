			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates unchanged THE UK money market bustled yesterday after the Bank of England forecast the biggest liquidity shortage of the year, but with sentiment unchanged, period rates barely moved. 'The undertone is good in the market,' said one dealer. 'It still feels that the next move in base rates will be down but that progress is going to be slow.' Cash rates for one-month and three-month money eased slightly. The three-month interbank rate closed at 10 1/16 per cent, after Thursday's close of 10 1/8 per cent. Six-month money was unchanged at 10 per cent as was one-year money which closed at 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank of England's initial forecast of the day's liquidity shortage was Pounds 2.6bn - already twice the size of Thursday's shortage. This was then revised to Pounds 2.9bn - the biggest shortage of the year, although not quite an all-time record. According to the Bank of England, there were shortages of Pounds 3bn on a number of occasions last year. Traders said explanations for the size of the shortages were mainly technical. Shortages, generated by the Bank's gilts funding programme, had accumulated, pressured further by the loss of Monday's operations because of the bank holiday. In the early round the Bank bought bills totalling Pounds 953m followed later with a purchase of Pounds 494m of bills. This still left a rump of Pounds 1.65bn to be removed and the overnight rate firmed to 10 1/4 per cent from an earlier 9 5/8 per cent. In the afternoon the Bank bought bills worth Pounds 798m across the bands. Late assistance of Pounds 590m took total interventions of the day to Pounds 2.8bn, all but taking out the shortage. Overnight rates fluctuated between a low of 9 1/2 per cent and a high of 15 per cent. Trading was thin on the sterling futures market. The September contract traded in a four-tick range closing unchanged on the day at 90.36. The June contract drifted down to 90.02, also unchanged from the previous close. German call money rates firmed to just below the Bundesbank's 9.75 per cent Lombard rate due mainly to end of the month technical factors. Traders quoted call money at 9.65 per cent, up from 9.55 per cent on Wednesday.</p>

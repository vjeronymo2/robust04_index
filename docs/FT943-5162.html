			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / Hungary-Romania pact talks The Hungarian and Romanian foreign ministers said yesterday they would restart negotiations for a much-delayed friendship treaty between theirstates. The Romanian foreign minister, Mr Teodor Melescanu, who yesterday became the most senior Romanian government figure to visit Hungary officially since the end of communism in 1989, said he hoped the treaty would be completed by May 1995. Previous negotiations broke down in August 1993 on border and ethnic minority issues. Mr Laszlo Kovacs, the Hungarian foreign minister, said normalising relations with Romania was a priority of Hungary's new government and that Budapest was prepared to state in the treaty it had no territorial claims on Romania - Bucharest's key condition for signing. In return, he hoped Romania would grant its ethnic minorities human rights according to European norms. Romania's treatment of its 1.6m-strong ethnic Hungarian minority has been a frequent source of tension between the two countries.</p>

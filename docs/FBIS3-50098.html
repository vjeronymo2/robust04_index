			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Pavel Novotny report: "Our Arms Industry Is Focusing on </F> Exports"]    [Text] As Defense Ministry press spokesman Zdenek Borkovec  told us, the modernization of the T-72 tank is included in the  long-term plans of the Army of the Czech Republic. It is  assessing several offers, the one from the RDP Group among them.  Nevertheless, no agreement has been signed between the Defense  Ministry and the arms manufacturing consortium.    Moreover, Zdenek Borkovec says: "The Defense Ministry is  considering several alternatives of the modernization of the  T-72 tank. Because of the high financial requirements of the  project, the key problems of the solution are being examined  first. The RDP Group concept does not completely correspond to  the specified tactical technical demands of the army. The  aforementioned RDP concept is more export oriented."    Currently, 542 tanks of the T-72 series serve the Army of  the  Czech Republic. According to Zdenek Borkovec, neither the  number of tanks to be modernized, nor the time schedule for  their modernization have been decided. The optimum alternatives  -- with respect to the future orientation of the transforming  Czech Army and, above all, the limited financial resources --  are to be selected by the end of the year 1994.    Regarding the new technical concept of the army, the  principal document apparently is the "Concept of the Building of  the Army of the Czech Republic to 1996," which was discussed by  the government last June. It was decided that in the  realization of the intended goals, the same system of planning,  programming and budgeting (SPPR) will be used, as is commonly  used and accepted in the armies of the North Atlantic Alliance.  This system, which, according to Zdenek Borkovec, makes the  processes taking place in the army transparent, and facilitates  easier monitoring of the army by the parliament, will be applied  as early as this year.    The financing of the armed forces is covered by the Defense  Ministry chapter of the state budget, which assumes total  expenditures of 26.792 billion korunas and total revenues of 2.3  billion korunas. Of the total expenditures, 8.88 billion  korunas is intended for technical material, of which, 278  million is earmarked for the purchase of new arms, technology,  and other material as per the "Concept."    The new tank, which should be manufactured in coordination  with the RDP Group consortium, will allegedly meet the  requirements of the NATO organization concerning of its member  states' arms. According to the director general of the  consortium, Jan Vlcek, a number of the elements -- the  communication system, for instance -- are compatible with the  Alliance systems. According to Zdenek Borkovec, however, "the  notion of compatibility with NATO armies cannot be identified  with compatibility of arms. It is a logical sequence of certain  activities in which the compatibility of the equipment has its  place but it is not a primary one. First, the linguistic,  planning, communication, and other problems must be overcome.  Therefore, it is expected that approximately during the period  until 1996, only a part of the armed forces will be equipped,  above all, with the modern means of communication, command, and  reconnaissance."    Jan Vlcek claims in the RDP Group statement that one of the  alternatives of the modernization of the existing tank is  prepared for the Czech Army as the most important customer. The  army, according to the aforementioned information, adopted a  substantially more cautious stand. Exports will apparently be  necessary for RDP.</p>

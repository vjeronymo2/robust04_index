			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / Tens of thousands head north in Lebanon exodus 'like 1982': The road and in the hospitals with the shelling's victims TENS OF thousands of Lebanese families deserted villages across south Lebanon yesterday, 10 or more to a car, and fled north from sustained Israeli bombardments. In the biggest exodus in the country since the Israeli invasion of 1982, traffic was locked from early yesterday in jams along the coast road north. Cars queued four or five abreast as far south as Sidon, 30 miles from the capital. By late afternoon, another stream of cars was heading south, almost all only with drivers intent on picking up families or friends marooned in villages undergoing heavy shelling. Thousands were escaping from a night and day's pounding of Nabatiyeh and the surrounding villages of Jibsheet and Harouf at a rate of more than 10 a minute at times. Israeli jets roared over the villages throwing out anti-radar chaff. 'They don't stop. Every time I breathe I hear a shell,' said one middle-aged woman on her way out of Nabatiyeh. In villages a few miles clear of the shelling, families without cars to escape, or men waiting for a break in the bombardment so that they could rescue relatives, stood by the road in quiet, surly groups. Some craned over radios listening to the radio station of the Israeli-financed South Lebanese Army to hear if it would broadcast a warning to evacuate their towns - as it did for 20 villages yesterday, each of which was later shelled. Roads in the mountains were almost deserted but for saloon cars hurtling away from Nabatiyeh as shells exploded close to the road. Ambulances wailed their way to Sidon where the main Hammoud hospital was admitting new casualties about every 15 minutes by late afternoon. Many of the injured, like Mrs Hanna Moussa, her two sisters and a shrapnel scarred nine-month-old child who lay together bandaged in one of the wards, were clearly civilian casualties. They are also now refugees. 'Our house was destroyed by the bombs,' said Mrs Moussa. 'This hospital is our home.' Others, however, were Hizbollah fighters - the ostensible target of Israel's three-day barrage. In one half-hour spell yesterday, bearded men in blood-soaked fatigues, some wearing flak jackets, brought in two wounded, one on a stretcher, his head swathed in bloody bandages, another limping in with flesh wounds. Minutes later, a corpse was carried in, poorly wrapped in plastic bags and sticky-tape, and laid in the hospital entrance. The morgue was full. 'This is worse than 1982,' said Mrs Wassila Abdou, a doctor at the hospital. 'We have more civilians hurt.' That this bombardment is worse than the 1982 invasion was universally held by the huddled groups on south Lebanon's roadsides and from families speaking from the crush of packed saloon cars, or from the back of the numerous trucks carrying 20 women and children and more. 'The Israelis were attacking just the Palestinians,' said Mr Kamel Kassam, a car salesman. 'Now nobody feels safe in their homes in the day or in the night.' Shelling in and around Nabatiyeh fell over a wide and apparently random area. Sometimes buildings were hit, sometimes the roadside, sometimes just scrubland. But plumes of grey or white smoke rose over the centre of several of the villages visible around Nabatiyeh. 'Ninety per cent of the people have left my village,' said Mr Afif Salameh, a dentist from Doueir, four miles west of Nabatiyeh. 'There are no Hizbollah there, they just want Lebanese to leave their villages.' 'This is their aim,' said a Lebanese army colonel, sheltering with his men in a half-built apartment block overlooking Harouf. 'They want to drive everyone out of this area, then attack whoever is left. It is like 1982.'</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: RETAIL  </P> <P> 6 New Wet Seals: Wet Seal, the high-fashion store for women, continues to grow.  </P> <P> The chain said it opened six new stores this month, including a newly expanded  outlet at the Orange Mall.  </P> <P> Three of its new stores are in Florida, where the chain's officials are hoping  that the store's youthful appeal and sunbaked image will catch on. They also  have new stores in Hawaii and in Victorville.  </P> <P> Wet Seal, founded as a little Balboa Island shop in the 1950s, has opened five  other locations since March and expanded three others. The openings come on the  heels of Wet Seal's initial public stock offering in July. The company raised  about $43 million in the offering, which it is using to repay loans, upgrade  the company's computer system, and expand its Irvine distribution center and a  number of stores.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Hey, It's a Living: New York Mayor Edward I. Koch, already signed up as a  television commentator, is adding newspaper columnist to the growing list of  job titles he'll assume when he leaves office in January. Koch will write a  weekly column for the New York Post, the paper announced this week. "I will be  even less inhibited as a columnist than I was as mayor," Koch promised. "The  world will be my oyster." Koch, who will be succeeded by Democrat David  Dinkins, has already agreed to teach at New York University and do regular  commentaries for local television and radio stations. "Anyone who's ever  covered Ed Koch would have been very surprised to see him pull a General  (Douglas) MacArthur and fade away," said New York Post Editor Jerry Nachman.  DANIEL CERONE  </P></p>

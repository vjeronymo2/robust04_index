			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEIGHBOR REVIVES GIRL, 1, AFTER SHE NEARLY DROWNS IN BATHTUB  </P> <P> A 1-year-old girl was in stable condition Monday afternoon after she was found  in a bathtub and revived by a neighbor, authorities said.  </P> <P> Fire officials said Iris Cuevas was the ninth infant near-drowning victim  brought to Children's Hospital of Orange County this month and the fourth  within a week.  </P> <P> The infant's mother, Maria Ramirez, told police that she left Iris alone in the  bathtub for less than a minute and returned to find her in the bathwater not  breathing.  </P> <P> "She grabbed the child and ran outside of her apartment screaming and crying,  'My baby is dying,' " County Fire Capt. Dan Young said.  </P> <P> Richard Hahn, a resident of the apartment complex on the 17000 block of Kenyon  Drive, heard Ramirez calling and took the infant in his arms and started  mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.  </P> <P> "I said to myself, 'Tilt the head back, pinch off the nose,' and started  getting some air into her lungs," Hahn said. "I just focused on the kid."  </P> <P> After about nine puffs of air, Hahn said he could hear Iris' labored breathing.  Paramedics arrived and gave Iris oxygen. Soon after, Iris started to cry.  </P> <P> "That was quite a relief. . . . The paramedics said that was the best sign,"  Hahn said.  </P> <P> "(Hahn) seems to have made all the difference in the infant surviving," Young  said.  </P> <P> Iris was taken to Healthcare Medical Center in Tustin and later transferred to  Children's Hospital for observation, Young said.  </P> <P> "These near-drownings are a very common problem," Young said. "When it comes to  infants, you can't turn your back on them for a minute. . . . A minute is a  long time for an infant not to be breathing. People need to take that extra  moment to put their child in a safe location."  </P></p>

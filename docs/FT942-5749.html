			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Brussels to study mine sale The European Commission announced yesterday that it is to examine both the privatisation of east Germany's Mibrag brown coal mines and the takeover bid by the French state-controlled insurance company Assurances Generales de France (AGF) International for the Belgian life insurer Assubel Vie. It said the privatisation and the proposed takeover might fall under European Union merger rules, but reserved a final decision. Brussels will look at plans to acquire Mibrag through a share purchase by PowerGen, the UK energy utility, in partnership with energy concerns NRG Energy and Morrison Knudsen of the US. It will also investigate AGF's plan to create a company, Delta Capital, under which it will merge its Belgian assets AGF Belgium and L'Escaut with those of Assubel.</p>

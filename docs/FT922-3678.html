			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Galeries Lafayette seeks rest of unit GALERIES Lafayette, one of France's most famous chains of department stores, is launching a FFr718m (Dollars 134.2m) offer for the remaining shares in Nouvelles Galeries, the retailing group it won control of last year after a fierce takeover battle. Galeries Lafayette paid an estimated FFr2.15bn last summer for a controlling 72.5 per cent holding in Nouvelles Galeries' voting shares. It is offering FFr650 a share for the remaining 1.1m shares. Nouvelles Galeries owns a string of regional department stores and controls the BHV store in the Marais area of central Paris. A group of Nouvelles Galeries' major shareholders - including Societe Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris, the big French banks, and Devanlay, the textile group that battled against Galeries Lafayette in last year's bid  -have already accepted the offer. Devanlay fought for two months against Galeries Lafayette for control of Nouvelles Galeries in a battle that wound up in the law courts. Galeries Lafayette is offering the same price - which is significantly higher than the FFr563 at which Nouvelles Galeries' shares were suspended yesterday - to the public shareholders who control the remaining 496,298 shares in a public tender offer. The offer for Nouvelles Galeries comes shortly after the takeover of Au Printemps, the chief competitor to Galeries Lafayette in the French department store sector, by Pinault, the acquisitive distribution group. Other leading French department stores - including Au Bon Marche, a subsidiary of Mr Bernard Arnault's Agache, and Samaritaine - are engaged in aggressive marketing campaigns to protect their positions. Galeries Lafayette, which has opened a flagship department store on Fifth Avenue in New York, recently forecast a doubling of net profits, from FFr84.8m in 1990 to FFr177.2m in 1991, on total turnover of FFr17.5bn.</p>

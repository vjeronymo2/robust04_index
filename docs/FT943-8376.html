			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ukraine to boost coal imports and exports - A look at a paradoxical legacy of the Soviet era Ukraine will, paradoxically, both import and export more coal this year, illustrating how Soviet regulatory hangovers create shortages at home while western trade brings much-needed hard currency profits. The once mighty coal producer, saddled with exhausted pits and antiquated technology, annouced this week that falling production would force it to import 15m tonnes of coal to meet minimum domestic needs. Ukraine remains keen, however, to keep exports at 12m tonnes a year, up from 10m tonnes in 1989. Its main customers are the UK, Belgium and Italy, who pay between Dollars 21 and Dollars 100 a tonne, depending on quality. Domestic prices are roughly half that - ranging from 500,000 to 1.7m Ukrainian karbovanets (Dollars 11.6 to Dollars 39.50) a tonne - because they are set by regulations linking selling prices to production cost. So the state coal committee, which receives coal from the pits and distributes it to users, likes to skim off as much as possible for the more lucrative export markets. 'We have an unlimited amount of coal for the next 100 years in the Donbass. But we need modern equipment. This is why we are exporting coal for hard currency,' says Mr Sergei Fishenko, head of the government's coal department. A traditional coal exporter, Ukraine this year will produce 100m tonnes, down from 131.9m last year. To bridge the gap, it plans to barter metals for coal from Russia and Poland, former trading partners under the old Comecon regime, enabling it to satisfy its western customers. The Ukrainian government has been unwilling to liberalise energy prices, even though mounting shortages suggest no other practical option. This deepens the energy crisis and delays restructuring of heavy industry away from energy-intensive activities. The mining sector, once a Soviet showcase, mirrors Ukraine's economic plight. The heavily subsidised mines in the country's eastern Donbass region drain state coffers with minimal return: the 1.2m coal miners at 262 mines - 5 per cent of the labour force - produce, on average, 5 per cent of the coal a western coal miner does; and the Kiev government is this year paying about Dollars 50m a month in subsidies. The productivity gap can be blamed partly on antiquated equipment, which itself carries a high environmental cost. Ukraine's coal pits contribute 3 per cent (2.2bn cubic meters) of the world's emission of methane, a greenhouse gas associated with global warming. Accidents are another problem. Some four miners die for every 1m of coal produced - the highest rate in the world - MDNM/ in the Donetsk district alone 213 people were killed last year. Many mines should be closed; but that would carry the politically unpalatable social cost of mounting unemployment. Despite a poor summer crop, Ukraine will not import grain this year, the Food and Agriculture Department announced this week. Last year it produced 45m tonnes but analysts expect this year's crop to be below 40m; and the announcement that it will not resort to imports comes as a surprise. A summer drought helped push yields down, but Mr Csaba Csaki, an agroeconomist at the World Bank in Washington, commented: 'The inherited inefficiency of the collectives and input supplies and the trade break-down are the real problem - just don't blame the weather'.</p>

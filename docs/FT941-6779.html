			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: ECP sector gaining in popularity - International Although it has been overshadowed by the bigger and more glamorous Eurobond market over the past few years, the European commercial paper (ECP) market has been enjoying a quiet but steady rise in its popularity. Renewed confidence in the market's ability to provide quick access to short-term liquidity at competitive rates is seen as the main factor helping to attract a growing number of issuers and investors. BZW said in a recent review that question marks over the liquidity and efficiency of the ECP market were finally eliminated last June when the Kingdom of Denmark raised as much as Dollars 1.5bn in a matter of days to support the Danish krone when it came under attack from foreign exchange speculators. Confidence in the market's depth was given a further boost by the launch of large ECP programmes by Ford Credit Europe, Hanson and Guinness which allowed them to quickly raise funds of more than Dollars 1bn, amounts which have previously been the sole domain of sovereign borrowers. Mr David Knight, managing director of CP operations at BZW, says the progressive convergence of rates between the domestic CP market in the US, where outstandings are estimated at Dollars 500bn, and the ECP market has meant that at times, rates in the ECP market are lower than in the US. 'This has resulted in cheaper cost of funding for US companies,' he says, adding that the ECP market also provides them with a tax-efficient way of funding their European operations. Mr Chris van Niekerk, director of money-market business at Swiss Bank Corp in London, also attributes the rise in ECP volume to the inroads which the ECP market has made into the German and Swiss domestic markets as a result of deregulation in the two countries. Issuers can now issue in D-Marks and Swiss francs directly under their ECP programmes. 'Calling it a Euro-CP market is a bit of a misnomer because it is becoming a global CP market outside the US domestic market,' he says. The short maturities available in the ECP market, from one day to 364 days, make ECP highly suitable as an underlying asset for investors wishing to swap into other currencies which have greater yields. Mr van Niekerk estimates that 35 per cent of the ECP volume issued by borrowers in dollars is swapped into other currencies by investors. 'Due to the volatility in the currency market this has been a fruitful activity for investors,' he says. The revival in the market's fortunes has been reflected in an increase in dollar-denominated ECP issuance, which accounts for around 80 per cent of the whole ECP market. Having dropped as low as Dollars 75.1bn last March, dollar-denominated ECP outstandings rose as high as Dollars 85.1bn in November. They are currently estimated to be about Dollars 81.5bn. Ms Julie Joe, CP product manager at Lehman Brothers, is optimistic on prospects for 1994 and believes ECP market volume could increase by 10-15 per cent this year. 'The bearish interest-rate environment favours issuance in the short-term market,' she says. In recent years, the downward spiral in interest rates has prompted issuers to lock in historically low rates with long-dated bond issues. However, this type of financing has become more difficult since the start of this year as the fear of higher interest rates has prompted investors to focus on the short end of the yield curve. Lesser dependence on time deposits by clearing banks has also encouraged investors to park liquid assets in the ECP market, where rates are often more favourable. At the same time, the short-term nature of the ECP market meets the investment criteria of Far Eastern investors who are increasingly flush with cash. ECP experts believe that as a greater fluidity develops between the ECP market and US CP market, investors who buy ECP will become more flexible regarding the credit ratings of issuers. At present, investors in ECP tend to be rather conservative and restrict themselves to paper issued by top-rated borrowers. However, as in other fixed-income and equity markets, there has been growing investor demand for unrated ECP issued by emerging market borrowers, notably from Mexico. As a result of this 'black-and-white' attitude to credit ratings, many issuers with mediocre ratings have difficulty in raising significant sums in the ECP market. By contrast, they have relatively good access to the US domestic market. Mr Knight believes that the improving economic climate in the US and the UK (these two geographic regions account for 33 per cent of all ECP issues) should see an improvement in the fortunes of borrowers which have been downgraded over the past few years. 'The upgrading to the critical A1/P1 level will allow heavy issuers to resume issuance,' he says. In addition to the ECP market accepting a wider range of credits, Ms Joe highlights the asset-backed sector as a potential area for growth. This kind of issuance is already well-developed in the US.</p>

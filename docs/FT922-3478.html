			<p>920611 FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Moody's cuts rating on four Japanese trust banks MOODY'S Investor Service, the US credit ratings agency, lowered the ratings of four Japanese trust banks due to their vulnerability to the volatile stock market and deterioration in earnings quality. Moody's lowered long-term debt ratings of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking and Sumitomo Trust and Banking to A2, and Yasuda Trust and Banking and Toyo Trust and Banking to A3. Moody's said that the trust banks were affected by financial liberalisation in Japan, and faced lower profitability due to the sharp falls in stock and real estate prices. The trust banks have substantial bad loans to real estate companies and non-bank financial institutions. Trust banks are also hurt by the decline in fee based income from discretionary investment management and real estate broking. Japan's Deposit Insurance Corp (DIC) will give Sanwa Bank Y20bn (Dollars 156m) to assist its merger with Toyo Shinkin Bank, Reuter reports from Tokyo. DIC said the money would be given as a grant, which does not need to be repaid.</p>

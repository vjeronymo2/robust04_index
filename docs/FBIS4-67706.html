			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, Mar 24, (INA)--Iraqi Health Ministry  confirmed the success of its preventive measures against the  virus of Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome [AIDS], thus  keeping Iraq clean from this fatal disease.    Official source at the Ministry told INA today, since early  stages, health authorities in Iraq gave this particular issue a  great deal of concern to prevent this disease which had recently  invaded most of the world regions.    The Ministry was imposing strict measures on blood tests for  incomers and carried out examinations on imported human blood to  verify being free of the AIDS virus.    The source made it clear that some AIDS [cases] had been  recorded in the northern part of Iraq after the 30-state  aggression of 1991 which had given access to the foreign troops  inside the Kurdish autonomy area the matter that left this  region beyond the monitoring of health authorities.    The source concluded by saying that further precautions had  been adopted by the Iraqi authorities to prevent the spread of  AIDS from the area lies under the control of the pro-Western  elements to the rest parts of the country.

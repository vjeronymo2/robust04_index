			<p>BFN     [Text] It was learned on 27 May that during negotiations  on the resumption of the framework trade talks, the United  States rejected a Japanese definition of objective criteria.  This was learned when the draft agreement drawn up by Japan was  compared with the final agreement on the resumption of the trade  talks, which was disclosed on 27 May. The Japanese Government  has so far evaluated the results of the negotiations highly. A  government source said: "It is now clear that objective criteria  are not numerical targets." But after the details of the  negotiations were disclosed, the same government source  expressed concern, saying: "Washington will interpret objective  criteria as something similar to numerical targets." Another  government source said the Hata administration, which is in a  precarious position, "might have given priority to `reopening'  the trade talks in an attempt to earn diplomatic points to  strengthen its power."    A government source who participated in the recent  unofficial  negotiations with Washington considers the final agreement to be  advantageous to Japan. Stressing that the demand for setting  numerical targets was averted, he said: "Japan is not bound by  numerical targets and will not be criticized [for not achieving  such targets]."    However, Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa, a top Japanese  negotiator in the talks with the United States, said: "Although  objective criteria are not numerical targets, Washington will  put forward a demand very similar to that for setting numerical  targets." As such, there is strong concern about Washington's  future moves. Japan and the United States have agreed that  objective criteria should be defined as "qualitative and  quantitative standards." A government source expressed concern  that Washington might give much weight to quantitative  yardsticks, saying: "In sectorial trade talks, Tokyo and  Washington will argue over what quantitative yardsticks should  be, whether they should use total trade volume or market shares  as yardsticks. Each side will try to adopt benchmarks  advantageous to itself."    Some government officials are critical of the recent  agreement. One official said: "Although trade is a two-way act,  the recent agreement includes only demands on Japan and makes  few references to what the United Stats should do."    Both Japan and the United States have reasons for having  made  the hasty agreement. President Bill Clinton needs to promote  cooperation with Asia, because there is criticism within his  administration against his Asia policy. Meanwhile, the Hata  government has to take some measures to strengthen its power.    A government source said: "It is highly possible that in the  resumed talks, the two countries will again confront each other  over objective criteria. It is very questionable to say that it  was right for Japan to have made that heavy concession."</p>

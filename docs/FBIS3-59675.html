			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Kawasaki Heavy Industries (KHI) formally announced  on 22 September 1993 that it had reached agreement with Allied  Signal, a major U.S. aircraft and automobile parts manufacturer  (New Jersey, Chairman Lawrence A. Bossidy) to jointly develop an  auxiliary power unit (APU) for small civil aircraft. KHI will  assume 15 "risk and revenue sharing" involved in developing the  APU and will be in charge of the development and production of  gear boxes, an important element of the APU.    In addition to KHI, it has been decided that BMW and Rolls  Royce (a joint venture company of Germany's BMW and the UK's  Rolls Royce), as well as Italy's Alfa Romeo Avio, S.A., will  participate in more or less equal proportions; thus the APU will  be an international project jointly developed by four countries.  The prospect is for development expenses to amount to about $5  billion. The price per unit will be in the vicinity of &yen;35  million and it is forecast that approximately 3000 units will be  sold by the year 2015.    The APU will be installed in the rear of passenger planes  and  used for such purposes as starting the main engines and powering  cabin air conditioning. Allied Signal holds about a 90 percent  share of the world APU market.    It has been decided that the APU to be developed will be  adopted for the "Gulfstream V," a business jet already under  development by Gulfstream. The first APU is slated to be  delivered to Gulfstream in May 1995.</p>

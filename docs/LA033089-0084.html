			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ORDINANCE TO CAP GROWTH WON'T WORK, COUNCIL SAYS  </P> <P> Five months after requesting an ordinance designed to place a cap on population  in Glendale's increasingly crowded neighborhoods, council members acknowledge  that the proposed measure would do little more than improve the city's  aesthetic appearance.  </P> <P> The proposed zoning ordinance would require new apartment buildings to be  smaller, shorter, better-looking and, therefore, more expensive to build than  those now rising throughout the city's multiple-unit residential areas. But the  proposed law would have a marginal impact on population growth, city officials  said this week.  </P> <P> After its third study session on the proposed changes Tuesday, the City Council  postponed voting on the measure for at least a week. However, council members  have yet to comment on the individual items that make up the complex proposal,  and it may take well over a month before any decision is made.  </P> <P> "We'll take as much time as we need to get it right," Councilman Larry Zarian  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Favorable Vote Indicated  </P> <P> Several council members said they are inclined to vote for the package of  zoning changes. But they also said the council will have to start from square  one to achieve its oft-stated goal of limiting Glendale's population to about  200,000, in accordance with the city's general plan.  </P> <P> Senior Planner James Glazer, architect of the proposed ordinance, told the  council that under present zoning laws, there is room in Glendale for 49,000  new apartment units. The city has 40,788 multiple-family units and 27,687  single-family units.  </P> <P> If the council adopts the proposed ordinance, he said, building restrictions  would reduce the number of units by 8,000. And if the council incorporates  recommendations made by the Chamber of Commerce in the proposal, the number of  potential new units would not change.  </P> <P> The news did not please council members.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Moratorium Imposed  </P> <P> Problems caused by population growth such as school overcrowding and traffic  congestion prompted the council six months ago to unanimously adopt a  moratorium on building and begin work on the proposed zoning ordinance.  </P> <P> "The reason for the moratorium is the dramatic growth in this area," Mayor Carl  Raggio wrote in a Glendale News-Press editorial in October, one month after  voting for the 150-day apartment-building freeze. The moratorium was later  extended until April 24.  </P> <P> "The five months should be sufficient to restructure an ordinance and code that  assures quality associated with apartment building," he said.  </P> <P> After Tuesday's study session, three council members acknowledged that they  were surprised and disappointed when the planning staff introduced the measure  Feb. 28 without provisions to drastically reduce growth.  </P> <P> "They misunderstood our instructions," Councilwoman Ginger Bremberg said. "We  thought we made it absolutely clear that we wanted a population cap, but they  went into aesthetics and design when we thought they were working on population  reduction. I was a little astonished when they came up with the ordinance."  </P> <P> Councilman Larry Zarian agreed. "The intent was to reduce population growth,"  he said. "Whether we stated it clearly or not, it should be clear through the  numerous statements we made in public and to the press. We've been saying for  three or four years that we want to limit our population to 200,000, and I was  surprised that the ordinance does not accomplish that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Measure Called 'Inadequate'  </P> <P> Councilman Jerold Milner called the proposed ordinance "totally inadequate. We  wanted it to reduce the number of building units allowed it the city, and it  clearly did not."  </P> <P> Raggio would not criticize the work, but said further legislation would be  required to limit the city's population growth.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Councilman John F. Day said that trying to control  population growth is an "exercise in futility." He said the city could not  control the influx of immigrants pouring into Glendale, "short of keeping  people out, because the population is going to grow."  </P> <P> Glazer said he estimates that Glendale's population of 165,000 will level off  eventually at 200,000 to 230,000, as projected in the city's general plan. But  before then, it will probably exceed that number by between 50,000 and 100,000,  he said. He said he based his projections on the fact that the pace of growth  is surpassing the attrition rate of large, nonconforming apartment buildings in  single-family and low-density zones, but that population eventually will fall  as such buildings are removed.  </P> <P> He refused to say whether he had received a mandate from the council to address  population growth in the proposed ordinance.  </P> <P> Glazer would only say that his instructions, as he understood them, were "one,  to identify community values in terms of design and what's being built and,  two, try to establish solutions."  </P> <P> Population growth notwithstanding, council members said they were pleased with  the planning staff's solutions to improve the quality of apartment buildings in  Glendale.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Follow-Up Measure Possible  </P> <P> Bremberg, Raggio and Zarian said they favor adopting the proposed ordinance  without major changes, then immediately putting the staff to work on another  ordinance that would restrict growth mainly by rewriting zoning laws to limit  building heights and density. Zarian and Raggio said they believe that they can  keep the population close to 200,000. "It will be very difficult but it's a  wonderful goal," Bremberg said.  </P> <P> Milner said he believed that the city's population could be kept to close to  200,000 without having to rezone a single block. He said it could be  accomplished by limiting the size of underground parking garages to 50% of the  property area.  </P> <P> This limitation, added to the requirement of 2 1/2 to three parking spaces per  unit in the proposed ordinance, would automatically reduce the amount of units  that a developer could place on any given lot, Milner said. He said he will  make this proposal at the next council session where the proposed ordinance is  discussed.  </P> <P> On Tuesday, the council postponed acting on the measure to allow more public  comment. The Fair Growth Coalition, a developers group, is scheduled to make a  presentation Tuesday.  </P> <P> Fair Growth Coalition representative Haik Vartanian told the council March 21  that his group would not be making a presentation and accused the council of  "political grandstanding." But he said Tuesday that his group changed its mind  at the urging of Day and Zarian.  </P></p>

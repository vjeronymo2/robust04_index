			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / International Company News: Sanyo Electric falls to loss of Y1.29bn SANYO Electric, the Japanese consumer electronics group, will press ahead with a sweeping restructuring in an attempt to improve profitability after reporting a net loss of Y1.29bn (Dollars 10.38m) for the year to the end of last November. Sanyo said it would introduce a decentralised management system focused on distinct profit centres, from manufacturing to customer services. The company added it would restructure its ailing audio visual products and office automation businesses to cut costs and improve profitability. The restructuring, which has included a shake-up of senior management, marks a sharp shift in strategy. In the late 1980s, Sanyo - in common with the rest of the Japanese electronics industry - focused on expanding market share and sales volumes through the rapid introduction of a widening array of products. But Japanese companies are under increasing pressure to cut costs in order to improve profitability after three successive years of falling profits. Sanyo Electric's sales fell by 3.2 per cent to Y1,537bn, largely due to the slowdown in Japan combined with falling exports to Europe and sluggish growth in the US. Operating income fell by 76.8 per cent to Y11.5bn, while pre-tax profits were 98.6 per cent down at Y562m. Canon, the camera and copier maker, yesterday announced a senior management reshuffle, with the promotion of Mr Hajime Mitarai, the managing director, to the company's presidency. He will succeed Mr Keizo Yamaji, who will become chairman.</p>

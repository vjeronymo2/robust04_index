According to the press center, leader of the Georgian  delegation Jaba Ioseliani accused the Abkhazian side of waging  "ethnic cleansing" in Abkhazia's Gali Region and said that "the  Abkhazians respect only the language of force." He expressed  doubt with respect to further continuation of the negotiations.  Leader of the Abkhazian delegation Premier Sokrat Dzhindzholia  rejected Ioseliani's assertions and called them "insulting."    Meanwhile, member of the Georgian delegation Irakly  Makhavariani reported in his interview with the Georgian TV on  Thursday [24 February] that two days of the negotiations were  fruitless. In his words, the parties are coordinating the  document to return refugees to Abkhazia. Machavariani pointed  out that the parties occupy controversial positions on this  issue, that's why "it is difficult to find common approaches."    He did not rule out that negotiations to be concluded  February 24 would be continued on February 25 because, to quote  Machavariani, "there is a certain advance in the position of the  Abkhazian party."</p>

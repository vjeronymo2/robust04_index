			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reform of Xinjiang's foreign trade system will be  deepened this year.    Since last year, the foreign trade departments of Xinjiang  have actively promoted reform and broadened the scope of opening  up, achieving noticeable results in foreign economic relations  and trade and enabling the region to sharply increase its  imports and exports--its import-export volume totaled $911.545  million last year, an increase of 30.3 percent over the previous  year. However, due to the slow transformation of the operating  mechanisms of state- owned foreign trade enterprises, and due to  their poor ability to cope with the changing situations, their  exporting capacities have been seriously affected. This year  the region will adopt six reform measures to encourage and guide  foreign trade enterprises to earn more foreign exchange and  profits.    -- All state-owned foreign trade enterprises will be  required  to link their economic results to the total amount of their  wages, and make workers' wages and bonuses directly dependent on  enterprises' foreign exchange earnings and economic  results--there will be no upper or lower limits for workers'  wages and bonuses. In addition, a distribution incentive  mechanism becoming to foreign trade enterprises will be  established, and foreign trade enterprises will be encouraged to  boldly experiment with instituting the system of "deciding one's  wage according to the amount of their finished work computed in  U.S. dollars" [mei yuan gong zi han liang, 5019 0337 1562 6327  0698 6852].    -- State-owned foreign trade enterprises will institute the  all-personnel labor contract system and the system of promoting  people based on competition and on their work  performances--people with ability will be promoted and  incompetent people will be demoted. The "iron armchair  [guaranteed rank]" and "life-long tenure" systems will be  abolished.    -- Accounting units of foreign trade enterprises will be  subdivided to eliminate enterprises' equalitarianism and to  break their "large rice bowls." Enterprises with required  conditions may establish branches, and under the macroeconomic  regulation and control of their head companies should work to  consolidate their branches' functions, responsibilities, and  powers.    -- In allotting quota permits to foreign trade enterprises,  we should consider the enterprise's efficiency, adhere to the  principle of being fair, and do things openly. At the same  time, we should encourage competition among enterprises and  allot quota permits to winners.    -- We will encourage joint operations by enterprises. This  kind of joint operation is to be based on trade and is aimed at  improving enterprises' economic results. Enterprises may enter  in joint operation by buying shares of other companies, by  joining their business activities, by pooling funds, or by  cooperating with each other. They also may establish foreign  trade enterprise groups.    -- We will systematically carry out enterprise reform. At  first on a trial basis, we will create necessary conditions to  gradually reorganize foreign trade enterprises with required  conditions into regular limited liability companies or  joint-stock companies.</p>

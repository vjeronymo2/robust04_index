			<p>BFN     [Text] The All Indian Congress Committee (AICC) on Friday  dismissed criticism of its economic polic of inviting foreign  investment and congratulated the Government for reviving the  "sick economy" it had inherited from the non-Congress  governments in 1991.    The resolution which was introduced by Mr Narain Dutt Tewari  and seconded by Commerce Minisster Pranab Mukherjee, praised the  Narasimha Rao Government for carrying on the policies of Rajiv  Gandhi under the overall perspective chalked out by late  Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi.    It condemned the "baseless, mischievous and malicious  propaganda launched by non-Congress parties against India's  signing of the GATT agreement. It said it recognised the  benefits that the country would get from the multilateral,  rule-based trading system. "A multilateral system which is based  on negotiations and flexibility is better for a country like  India."    Observing that the public sector was extremely useful for  the  economy, the resolution said "the public sector will, however  have to become profitable. Such obligations are best met when  public enterprises make profits, not losses."    In a highly self-congratulatory tone it noted that India was  the only country in the world that had recorded positive growth  rates in the first three years of its reforms-cum-fiscal  correction programme. It urged the Government to effectively  deal with the problems confronting urban India and said the time  has come to look at rural and urban development not separately  but as interlinked phenomena.    Later, intervening in the debate, Finance Minister Manmohan  Singh said a lot of funds from the non-resident Indians and  foreign investments had come in due to the new economic policy  being pursued by the Centre. This would boost production and  generate employment, taking India towards progress and  self-reliance, Dr Singh said while rounding up the discussion on  the economic resolution.    Earlier Mr Mukherjee said the Centre's policy was to attract  direct foreign investments for higher growth and instead of  depending on borrowings alone.    However, the foreign investment would come "on our terms and  in areas we consider essential", he said.</p>

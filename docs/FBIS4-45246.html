			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Thai Drugs Suspect `Duped'"] </F>   [Text] A Manchester woman held by Thai police for smuggling  11lb of heroin claimed yesterday that she had been duped by a  Nigerian boyfriend and thought she was carrying gold or  jewellery.    Speaking from her cell yesterday, Patricia Fury, a convicted  prostitute, said: "I honestly didn't know it was drugs. A  Nigerian boyfriend called Paul told me he dealt in gold and  jewellery. When he asked me to take something, I assumed it was  gold or jewellery."    When customs officials arrested her at Bangkok airport as  she  arrived to catch a flight to Singapore, they found her bag  contained heroin with a street value of &pound;100,000. The  Nigerian, who claimed to be a bullion dealer, had vanished.    Fury, a mother of two boys aged ten and five, works the  Manchester red-light district near her home in Longsight and was  last arrested for prostitution on April 12. She is also known as  Hussein and has convictions for soliciting going back to 1986  and a suspended jail sentence for shoplifting but she has no  drug convictions.    Fury's story is similar to that of Birmingham's Karyn Smith  and Patricia Cahill, convicted in 1990 and 1991 of trying to  smuggle heroin out of Thailand. They were pardoned after three  years in jail.</p>

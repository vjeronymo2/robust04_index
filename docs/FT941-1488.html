			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Cash merry-go-round puts M3 in a spin: Why is Germany's money supply sky high? It's mostly a question of avoiding tax Built of glass and steel, the Deutsche Bank headquarters on the outskirts of Luxembourg looks more like a cross between an art gallery and a high-security prison than a branch of Germany's biggest bank. Enter the imposing building and the customer is confronted with a 9.2 metre-high sculpture which would not be out of place on the set of Jurassic Park, the Spielberg dinosaur movie. The walls are hung with garish paintings and there is not a cash-dispenser in sight. Although lacking the facilities of a normal bank branch, this is the biggest credit institute in the Grand Duchy, a temple of mammon built in tribute to the colossal sums of money which slosh backwards and forwards between Germany and its tiny neighbour. The sloshing has become more pronounced in recent months, generating huge profits for the German banks (Deutsche Bank Luxembourg last week announced a 51 per cent increase in earnings) and helping to trigger the explosive growth in German money supply in January and February. Over the last three years at least DM300bn (Pounds 116bn) has been parked by Germans in offshore accounts. The money has gone primarily to the Grand Duchy, says Mr Peter Pietsch, an economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, although Switzerland, Austria and the Channel Islands have also benefited from the cash exodus. Much of it has found its way to Luxembourg in the form of banknotes stuffed into suitcases and carrier bags, unloaded over the counter and booked into discreet numbered accounts at any one of the Grand Duchy's 218 banks. But there is no need to make the drive down the Mosel valley, banknotes stashed in the boot - simply pay a visit to any bank branch in Germany and the customer is inundated with suggestions as to how money can be transferred at the flick of a computer switch. Underlining the symbiotic links between Luxembourg and Germany, most of the cash has then flowed back into the German capital markets, invested by the banks in German government securities on their customers' behalf. It is estimated that of the DM230bn spent by 'foreigners' buying bunds last year, nearly DM50bn came from Germans investing in their home market principally via Luxembourg funds. This followed an inflow of DM46bn to Germany from Luxembourg in 1992. The catalyst to the capital movement is tax. For five years the German government has been struggling to find a way to tax interest earned on savings. Whilst the Finance Ministry has experimented with one form of tax after another, Germans have voted with their wallets - transferring their savings across the border to Luxembourg where there is no tax on interest income. Although there is nothing illegal about transferring cash to Luxembourg, so long as the income is later declared in tax returns, the German tax authorities are convinced that the big banks have been helping their customers to evade rather than merely avoid tax commitments. Hence the spectacular raids on Dresdner Bank branches in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in January, when 40 tax officials confiscated documents and opened up the postbag between head office in Germany and the bank's branch in Luxembourg. The authorities alleged that the bank was systematically helping its customers shovel cash across to Luxembourg in order to evade tax; an incensed Dresdner has denied any impropriety and is planning to take its case to the Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe. Ironically enough, this court has already played a major role in stimulating capital flight. On June 27 1991 it ruled that the government must re-introduce a tax on interest income, having dropped a previous levy because of its disastrous impact on the German capital market. The government's response was the so-called Zinsabschlagsteuer (ZAST), a 30 per cent tax on interest income which is deducted at source by banks when they credit the interest to bund holders. This came into effect at the beginning of last year. Despite sharply increased thresholds for tax-free interest, private savers reacted with what the Bundesbank described as 'fairly massive evasive reactions and roundabout transactions via neighbouring financial centres'. The natural vehicle for such transactions were Luxembourg funds. The number of such funds managed by German institutions rose from 32 to 168 between 1991 and 1993. Over the past five years the number of German banks represented in the Grand Duchy rose from 40 to 63. The roundabout continued in the latter months of last year when Germans repatriated at least DM25bn out of Luxembourg back to Germany. This reversal of the usual pattern reflected a change in the tax law affecting rolled-up interest. The flow of funds back to Germany was a key reason behind the surge in M3 money supply in December to February which has in turn made it harder for the Bundesbank to cut interest rates despite sharply falling inflation. If the Luxembourg connection has dealt a knock to the Bundesbank's credibility, the German government has suffered a more tangible blow: to its tax revenues. The ZAST has proved a disappointing source of income at a time when every penny of tax is helpful to plug a yawning budget deficit. Total income from the tax last year was DM11bn - far below the projected DM24bn. But Mr Thomas Mayer, international economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, says the ZAST was deliberately designed to be less than wholly effective. 'There has been a silent collusion between the state and the investor,' he claims. If the tax had been watertight, Germans masquerading as foreign investors would not have bought bunds in such huge quantities last year. Their purchases drove capital market interest rate to historic lows in 1993, helping the state to finance its deficit more cheaply than if the money had gone elsewhere. Such a suggestion elicits no more than a harrumph from the Bonn Finance Ministry, which sticks to its position that it will use the German presidency of the European Union in the second half of the year to try to harmonise tax on interest income throughout the EU. Such an agreement would eliminate the catalyst to capital flows within the EU, but Luxembourg may be difficult to bring into line. 'There is no point in reaching agreement just within the EU,' says a senior Luxembourg official. 'The money would just go to Switzerland or Austria.' Luxembourg sticks to its position that it wants tax harmonisation within all OECD countries. This laudable goal is unlikely to be realised for decades, if ever, ensuring that the money roundabout will continue to revolve.</p>

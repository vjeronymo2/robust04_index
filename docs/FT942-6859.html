			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Strong currency hits South Africa A sharply stronger financial rand worked against shares, compounding the day's downward drift as the market struggled for fresh direction. Golds were undermined further as the bullion price weakened. The overall index closed 95 down at 5,390, industrials were 57 points lower at 6,598 and golds lost 71 or 3.7 per cent to 1,877. Remgro continued to pick up following selling related to fears of smoking curbs, cigarette price rises and raised alcohol prices under the new government. It added 50 cents to R29.25. De Beers lost R3.25 to R101 and Anglos R8.50 at R215.50.</p>

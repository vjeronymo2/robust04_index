			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEST DENIES LAKERS WILL PUT KAREEM ON THE BENCH  </P> <P> Los Angeles Lakers general manager Jerry West has denied a published report  that he is considering making six-time NBA Most Valuable Player Kareem  Abdul-Jabbar a backup center.  </P> <P> "At this point and time, everything that was written was asinine," West said  about an article published today in the Daily Breeze of Torrance. "Nothing's  going on right now."  </P> <P> The story said that Abdul-Jabbar, at 41 the oldest player in NBA history as  well as the league's all-time leading scorer, would average 14 minutes per game  in a backup role.  </P> <P> Also, unidentified sources close to the two-time defending NBA champions were  quoted as saying the club is actively pursuing a trade that would bring Indiana  forward Herb Williams to Los Angeles in exchange for Laker forward Orlando  Woolridge.  </P> <P> Woolridge was signed to a five-year contract last summer after he became a free  agent.  </P> <P> The story was written Tuesday night, after the Lakers suffered their eighth  straight road loss, a 106-97 decision at Sacramento.  </P> <P> West was quoted in the story as saying: "I won't confirm or deny that  speculation. I will say this: If we ever ask Kareem to evaluate his status it  would be out of respect for everything he's done for this franchise. Our  primary interest is that he goes out with the dignity he's earned over a great  career."  </P> <P> West met with Pacer executives Donnie Walsh and George Irvine over the weekend,  the Breeze quoted their sources as saying. The newspaper said the  Williams-Woolridge trade was "among other possibilities."  </P> <P> Walsh and Irvine attended the two Laker games -- at the Forum in nearby  Inglewood on Sunday and Tuesday night in Sacramento -- where the Lakers equaled  their longest road losing streak since the team moved to Los Angeles in 1960.  </P> <P> Lakers coach Pat Riley said he still plans on starting Abdul-Jabbar, but he  added: "We need something to shake things up. I believe the road defeats are  mental, and our grading system shows some players are 100% less effective on  the road."  </P> <P> Tuesday night, Abdul-Jabbar tried to evade reporters while heading for the team  bus.  </P> <P> "We're not playing effectively," was all the team captain would say.  Abdul-Jabbar played only 17 minutes against Sacramento.  </P></p>

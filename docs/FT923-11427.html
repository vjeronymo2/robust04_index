			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Central Park bandstand project aims to recapture historic design Sir, Let me clarify some of the issues raised in 'New York's oasis of the park' (July 13), an account of New York City Parks &amp; Recreation's proposed removal of the Naumburg Bandshell from Central Park. When Central Park was built, Frederick Law Olmsted included an octagonal cast-iron bandstand designed by Jacob Wrey Mould on a grassy area to the west of the mall. This bandstand remained until 1923 when it was demolished owing to its dilapidated condition, and replaced by the current bandshell on the east side of the mall. Now my agency feels that this facility, too, has seen its day, and should be removed. Unlike the original bandstand, which was open on all sides, the massive stone bandshell broke up the sweeping vista along the mall that Olmsted had intended. From the Wisteria Pergola atop the hill behind the bandshell, it was no longer possible to enjoy (as Olmsted had intended) a panoramic view of the mall and lake. For the next 50 years, popular classical concerts were held at the bandshell  -until 1980, when the Naumburg family concert series abandoned the bandshell for Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center because the site had become too loud and active for their concerts. As no one wanted to use it, the bandshell fell into decay. The mall is now in the final stages of an 18-month, Dollars 4m restoration. The project's purpose is to recapture the historic design of Central Park's most architecturally formal space, and to offer New Yorkers an unparalleled green setting featuring lawns and permanent seating under a cathedral canopy of elm trees. The bandshell has become an anachronism that attracts illegal activity and vandalism. The removal of the bandshell will restore the area to Olmsted's original plan, and make the area safer. My agency cannot afford to commit its limited resources to restoring and maintaining structures that no longer serve a useful public function.

			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Markets take the tug-of-war strain A TUG-of-war between economic realities and political uncertainty is likely to dominate the US credit markets over the next few weeks as Wall Street nervously adjusts to the probability of a Democratic victory in the presidential election. The elements of the tussle were neatly encapsulated in trading on Friday, when the government reported yet more grim economic news, which would normally be expected to give the credit markets a fillip. The trade deficit widened sharply in August, to Dollars 9bn, due to the largest drop in exports in five years. A separate report showed industrial output in the US fell two-tenths of 1 per cent in September, the third drop in the last four months. Coming on top of figures showing extremely weak - and consumer confidence-eroding - declining average weekly earnings, and poor early October car sales, Friday's statistics presented a picture of an economy growing very weakly. Yet the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell  3/16 on Friday, with the yield rising to 7.52, up from 7.5 per cent on Thursday and virtu-ally unchanged on the week. The reason for the yield upturn was a remark by Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate. He said he was examining new ways to 'bump this economy', and if elected might try to speed federal spending. There was not that much new about the remark. Mr Clinton has said many times that his priority on taking office would be to introduce a jobs programme. Democrats , are said to be preparing for a legislative blitz in Mr Clinton's first 100 days of office. The trouble for the credit markets is that little is known of Mr Clinton's precise plans, and Wall Street fears that a package of sharp fiscal stimuli will greatly increase the size of the budget deficit, and thus the government's borrowing requirement, while also reigniting inflation. Both would be bad for bond prices. The market will, therefore, be prone to attacks of nervousness at every fiscal package rumour up to election day, on November 3 - and well beyond if Mr Clinton wins. However, a Democratic victory might not prove quite so bad for the money markets as Wall Street fears. First, a stimulus from a Clinton administration would be constrained by the sheer size of the existing budget deficit. Second, a re-elected President Bush would almost certainly have to introduce an economic stimulus of his own. Third, however rapidly legislation was prepared, it would take many months for the impact to feed through into economic activity. And finally, the economy is so enfeebled, and price rises are so restrained, that the inflationary genie is not about to jump out of its bottle. Indeed, many economists still expect a further round of easing by the Fed, despite repeatedly dashed hopes of a move over the past few weeks. However, the bank may wait until after November 3, given the market's electoral jitters. But if Mr Clinton were to win, a subsequent Fed easing could further widen the already record yield gap between the short and long ends of the market. What remains uncertain is just how much Clinton jitters are already factored in to the long end, where over the past month bond yields have interrupted a downward trend, jumping sharply upwards from the year's low of 7.2 per cent, struck in early September. For example, Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C J Lawrence, expects the long bond to jump to 8 per cent if Clinton wins. Analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette are more sanguine, arguing that the back-up in rates will prove short-lived and that the long bond will reach 6.5 per cent by mid-1993.</p>

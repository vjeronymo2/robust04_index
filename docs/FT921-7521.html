			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Observer: Own goal Love and marriage, love and marriage, go together like . . . Masters &amp; Johnson. Not any more. The 21-year marriage, and 35-year partnership, of the world-famous sex therapists and authors of such tomes as Human Sexual Response and Human Sexual Inadequacy, are filing for divorce. William Masters, now 76, and Virginia Johnson, 67, are apparently basing their decision on 'difference in goals'. What hope is there for the rest of us . . . especially if we are Chelsea supporters?</p>

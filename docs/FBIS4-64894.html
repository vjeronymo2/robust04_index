			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hans Peter Stihl, president of the </F> Federation of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, by F.  Weckbach-Mara in Bonn; date not given: "Stihl: SPD Chancellor  Bad for the Economy"]    [Text] [Weckbach-Mara] Politicians are talking about an  economic upswing. When will the Germans profit?    [Stihl] The recession is bottoming out, but there cannot be  any talk about a strong upswing yet. We expect an economic  growth of approximately 1 percent throughout Germany this year.  At the same time, however, unemployment will continue to rise  and will reach about 4 million this year. A slight decline is  expected next year.    [Weckbach-Mara] Which government would the economy prefer  after the elections?    [Stihl] The German economy will cooperate with any  democratically elected government. However, I admit that I  would have considerable problems with the Greens. They are  hostile to the economy and want to lead the state back to the  last century.    [Weckbach-Mara] Would you prefer a Chancellor Scharping or  his Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD]?    [Stihl] With his government program, a Chancellor Scharping  would pass on the burden of unification to the population by  introducing a 20-percent supplementary surcharge. This is not  fair and would be a big economic mistake. In addition, the SPD  is planning changes concerning the taxes of family-owned  enterprises. In many cases, a higher inheritance tax would lead  to the sale of parts of firms or entire companies. The planned  renunciation of nuclear energy would be unacceptable for the  economy, and higher energy prices are against all reason. Thus,  a changeover of power from Kohl to Scharping would have a  negative impact on the economy and the creation of new jobs.    [Weckbach-Mara] Is that true?    [Stihl] Yes, it is. During Kohl's term of office, between  1983 and 1993, a total of 2.7 million jobs were newly created.  I cannot imagine that this successful development would  continue under a Scharping government on the basis of the SPD  program.    [Weckbach-Mara] It sounds as though you were completely  happy with the current government.    [Stihl] No, we are not. We expect the government to  bindingly promise the abolition of the solidarity surcharge. An  annual examination alone is not sufficient. After three years  at the latest, the solidarity surcharge should be gradually  reduced. With this announcement, the government would force  itself to save, which is necessary. It would also be useful to  announce a fundamental reform of the social security system for  the next legislative period.    [Weckbach-Mara] Do you support more retention?    [Stihl] Yes. One must really tell people that the existing  social system will not be able to assume the costs for the  treatment of diseases, for nursing care, and for old age in 20  years' time. Thus, people should take out a supplementary  insurance on a timely basis. A private life insurance is also  required in addition to the pension insurance scheme, which  numerous people already have.</p>

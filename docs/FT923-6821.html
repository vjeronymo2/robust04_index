			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Vivat 26% higher at Pounds 1.18m VIVAT HOLDINGS, the Lee Cooper jeans and casual wear manufacturer which has bounced in and out of the red in the last three years, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.18m for the six months to June 30. That compared with a profit of Pounds 934,000 for the comparable period 12 months earlier and with a Pounds 678,000 loss for the full 1991 year. The 26 per cent profits improvement was struck on turnover down 29 per cent to Pounds 35.6m. However, discontinued operations accounted for Pounds 7.4m of the sales decline. Mr Christopher Burnett, chairman, said he expected the group to report a positive result in the second half. 'I sincerely hope my shareholders do not have any other nasty shocks,' he said. Nonetheless, he remained cautious and the interim dividend is again passed. However, he 'very much hoped' that the company would be able to recommend a final - the company's last payment was a 0.5p final for the 1990 year. Mr Burnett said the advance in interim profits had been achieved by withdrawing from the loss-making operation in Germany and lower interest charges. He added that the group had reduced overheads by some Pounds 1.2m this year, helping margins to rise by 2 to 3 points. On-going businesses had actually suffered from the extent of recession, particularly in France, Vivat's largest market. Mr Burnett said the French clothing market alone had declined by 13 per cent in June compared to the previous year. Sales in continuing operations declined by 17 per cent, while similar operating profits fell from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 2.4m. The discontinued operations incurred losses of Pounds 752,000 in the first half of 1991. Profits were buoyed by a Pounds 275,000 reduction in interest charges to Pounds 1.2m. Gearing, which had been 73 per cent at the December year-end, fell to 63 per cent. No provisions were expected to be made in the current year. However, Vivat was still seeking to resolve the guarantees surrounding properties sold in 1988 to Chelsea Man, which has since gone into receivership. Mr Burnett said the group's Pounds 4m provision last year was expected to cover any costs arising from properties. Earnings per share rose from 1.4p to 1.6p.</p>

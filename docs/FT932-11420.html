			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (2): Europe on a Flemish stage - Antwerp, a city which mixes brio with introversion ANTWERP 93, the arts festival nearly a year long which began at the end of last month, marks the ancient port's turn as the European city of culture. It is 'very much a European programme performed on a Flemish stage,' in the words of Mr Bob Cools, the city's ebullient socialist mayor. But 1993 could be an even more defining year for Antwerp. It is attempting to rediscover its roots as an open city, at a time when it is under great pressure to turn inwards, and become a narrow and xenophobic capital of intolerant Flemish nationalism. The two golden ages of Antwerp were the 16th and 17th century - after Bruges silted up and Antwerp replaced it as the trading hub and great port of the north - and the 19th century, when it began to establish itself as the diamond centre of the world it is now. The port and the diamond trade remain pivots of Antwerp's local economy. Together they employ 100,000 people, with the port contributing 3.2 per cent of Belgian GNP, and diamonds accounting for 7 per cent of Belgium's exports. But they helped underwrite the extraordinary artistic flowerings of the golden ages, best marked by the early 17th century trio of master painters, Rubens, Van Dyck and Jacob Jordaens; and by the art nouveau architectural jewels that stud the city in fin de siecle flights of fancy. In the view of Mr Eric Antonis, the theatre director in charge of the Antwerp 93 programme, the best periods of the city's past were 'when it was an open, cosmopolitan entrepot; the worst were when we were a closed city.' He, as well as Mr Cools, acknowledges that the city has always been an uncomfortable mix of metropolitan brio and provincial introversion. Himself a native of Turnhout near the Dutch border, who has made most of his theatre career in Amsterdam, Mr Antonis has brought to his job a faith in Antwerp's best traditions. 'I have never seen a people so in love with their city,' he says. But the most stressed recent fact about Antwerp is an ugly one. In the 1991 elections, one out of every four of its inhabitants voted for the Vlaams Blok - a party of extreme-right Flemish nationalists who want to turn the city into a Flemish-only enclave. Under the chilling slogan Eigen Volk Eerst  -'Our People First' - and flying in the face of a history of wealth generated by Italian, English, German, Jewish and Dutch merchants, the Blok wants to deport the city's Moroccan and Turkish immigrants, who together amount to a mere 20th of Antwerp's population of 465,000. Optimists see the vote as a protest against the parochial squabbles of the traditional parties, divided across Belgium into Dutch and French-speaking clans of Christian Democrats, Socialists and Liberals, rather than the emergence of Antwerp as a fascist citadel. Mayor Cools says: 'I think that the people in this city who voted for the Blok must feel a little ashamed. I hope people are opening their eyes to what the Blok is, and how damaging it is to give Antwerp the reputation of an extreme right-wing city. After all, we are a port, a city which is supposed to be open to the rest of the world.' The Antwerper, Mr Cools insists, is not like that. 'He knows that when he puts his hand in the water, he is in contact with the entire world.' Yet the tension spilled over minutes after Antwerp 93's opening last month - and in a televised clash between Mr Antonis and Mr Cools; men essentially on the same side of the argument. Mr Antonis had brought in a Frenchman to stage Antwerp 93's opening fireworks display, overlooking the rival claim of a local pyrotechnician. The Frenchman opted for a difficult spectacle to emphasise the role of the River Scheldt in the city's life, with the fireworks hanging low over the water. Only a fraction of the 400,000 people who turned up could actually see it. The mayor attacked the director for not employing the local man. Mr Antonis shot back angrily: 'That sounds a bit like Eigen Volk Eerst.' Mr Antonis says he regrets the outburst. But he insists that there is a contradiction to be answered between the spirit of a truly international arts festival and the anti-foreigner animus stirred up by the Vlaams Blok. 'My answer is our history,' he says, adding that 'art is a bit like society's research department.' Among the exhibitions pleasing him most is a history of Antwerp as an open metropolis in the 16th and 17th century, 'with pieces of art telling the story.' Second, probably, comes the floating theatre constructed on the Scheldt. Companies from 14 cities will each work in residence for a week, showing theatre, dance and video, 'telling us what is going on in St. Petersburg and Johannesbourg, Los Angeles and Ljubljana, Marseilles and Stockholm.' The big Jordaens exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, marking the 400th anniversary of the local master's birth - is the first real overview of his work. Again, Mr Antonis sees the exhibition as evidence of the strength of openness working out of strong local roots. He is hoping that it will dispel the 'slightly provincial image' Jordaens has, partly because of Rubens and Van Dyck's more universal renown. The year's programme for Antwerp 93 is studded with attractions, from newly commissioned contemporary operas to steel bands. A permanent fashion centre will show off a brilliant new generation of Antwerp designers. In June, the Diamond High Council is putting on an exhibition of unique jewellery, much of it unseen, from private collections, including Romanov showpieces let out of the Kremlin for the first time. All this in a city with a rich variety of good food and drink in some 2,500 restaurants and bars: the expected 3m visitors can sup and quaff in settings ranging from the renaissance Grote Markt to the art nouveau Cogels-Osylei, from Chinatown to the riverside. Rather like Barcelona, with the Olympic Games, Antwerp is - on a more modest scale - using the festival to refurbish; restoring the city's turn-of-the century train station, the magnificent 19th century Bourla theatre, and the cathedral. The streets are clean, the facades and the trams are bright and gleaming, and Mr Cools has deftly pedestrianised about a fifth of the inner city. 'I fought for years for that,' he says, 'but thanks to 1993 I had the possibility to push it through at last.' Also like Barcelona, which used the Olympics to rediscover its waterfront, the Stad aan de Stroom (City on the River) scheme - two building developments intended to re-attach the river to the city it gave life to - has been revived by Antwerp 93, partly supervised by a Barcelona architect. But the most lingering effect sought by Mr Antonis is to make Antwerpers 'proud of their tradition as an open city,' which 'maybe - I say maybe - could lead to a return of more political openness.' The Blok called a press conference just after Antwerp 93 opened, to denounce it as propaganda directed against the party. Aside from the fireworks - damp squibs - Antwerp 93 may be succeeding.</p>

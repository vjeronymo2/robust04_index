			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 1 (XINHUA) -- From today on, the  exchange rate of Chinese yuan against U.S. dollar will be based  on an inter- bank foreign exchange trading, which is carried out  on the Shanghai Foreign Exchange swap market, now the country's  leading market of such kind.    The closing price of the previous day will be used by the  central bank as the basis of the inter-mediate price of the RMB  [renminbi] against major foreign currencies.    This was announced today by the People's Bank of China, the  central bank, which also indicated an official introduction of  market force into foreign exchange trading.    The intermediate prices, or the basic rates, are used by  banks and non-banking financial institutions to buy or sell  foreign exchanges, but with a maximum floating range of 2.5 per  thousand, a bank official said.    Today's basic rate for U.S. dollar was 8.6987 yuan.    The new system stresses the banks' role as they are now the  major supplier of foreign currencies.    According to well-informed sources, more than 50 banks and  financial institutions have gained the membership of the new  center, a dozen of them are foreign banks.    But as foreign banks are barred from local currency  business,  they can only sell foreign currencies to their fellow members  within the swap center.    The central bank allows them to exchange foreign currencies  to some renminbi yuan as their circulation funds, but the total  amount exchanged within a day cannot exceed 5 percent of their  capital.    While the inter-bank market is taking shape, foreign  exchange  swap markets across the country are kept open, which is used  exclusively by foreign funded companies.    "Unlike domestic companies, foreign-funded firms are not  required to sell their foreign currency earnings to Chinese  banks, therefore there is no point for the banks to meet their  hard currency needs," said an official from the state  administration of exchange control.    But he confirmed that the foreign exchange trading in the  swap market also follow the central bank's basic rates, and  hinted that the central bank will likely intervene in case of  big exchange rates taken place.    Although some banks complain that the floating range is too  narrow to reflect the actual market demand and supply, most of  financial experts agree that the limitation is necessary,  especially in the initial stage of the new exchange system.    The final goal of foreign exchange system reform is to make  renminbi a freely convertible currency, experts said. But they  added that the authorities will relax the control of the  floating scope only when the new system takes roots and both  banks and enterprises can afford the cost brought by bigger  foreign exchange fluctuation.</p>

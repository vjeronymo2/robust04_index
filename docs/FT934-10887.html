			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Casket shrugs off slow start from Lotus-branded cycles ROAD-GOING versions of the high technology Lotus bicycle on which Chris Boardman won an Olympic gold medal last year are not yet in the shops to the disappointment of Casket, the UK company which bought the LotuSport brand. However, interim pre-tax profits jumped 20.3 per cent to Pounds 2.13m, helped by FRS 3 which meant the company restated the comparative figure at Pounds 1.77m to include one-off costs amounting to Pounds 167,000 relating to reorganisation and closures. Sales climbed from Pounds 50.1m to Pounds 51.8m for the six months to September 30. The board declared an interim dividend of 0.4p (0.3p) out of earnings per share of 1.89p (1.56p). Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the six Lotus-branded conventional cycles that the company launched in the summer 'had got off to a slower start than expected'. He said: 'We had anticipated bringing them out with the road-going version of the Chris Boardman Olympic bike. Sales of the conventional bikes were always planned to revolve around them.' He said Lotus had had a 'certain amount of problems in making a sensible road bike'. Casket will assemble the top of the range cycles from components designed by Lotus Engineering: 'Lotus Engineering wanted a perfect design before it went to the market,' Mr Smith said. The setback would not hit results since the premium products had expected to give low sales. The cycles division as a whole, which includes names such as Townsend, Falcon and British Eagle, returned operating profits ahead at Pounds 2.58m (Pounds 2.45m) for the six months to September 30 on sales ahead at Pounds 28.6m (Pounds 27.4m). This year the company expects to assemble about 60 per cent of its units in the UK against 37 per cent in the comparative period. Casket said imported bikes were now subject to EC duties totalling about 50 per cent, including an anti-dumping levy, while components attracted much lower rates. The clothing division returned reduced operating profits of Pounds 273,000 (Pounds 336,000) on sales up at Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 22.7m) as market conditions remained difficult. Gearing fell to 78 per cent (91 per cent) at the half-way stage as net assets increased to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds 13.1m) and borrowings fell slightly to Pounds 11.6m (Pounds 11.9m). Interest cover rose to 3.9 times (3.1 times).</p>

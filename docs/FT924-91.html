			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / Fresh violence may batter Ayodhya INDIAN Moslem leaders left India's capital for Ayodhya yesterday to offer prayers at the site where an ancient mosque stood until it was destroyed by Hindu militants on December 6, Shiraz Sidhva writes from New Delhi. The government, which has informally tried to stop the Moslem leaders from offering prayers at the site of the Babri mosque where there has been no Moslem worship since 1949, fears the visit could spark off more communal violence. The destruction of the 400-year mosque prompted countrywide riots which left more than 1,200 dead. The Moslem leaders are expected to be arrested before they reach Ayodhya. Recently the Faizabad district administration allowed Hindu pilgrims to worship at a makeshift temple built on the site.</p>

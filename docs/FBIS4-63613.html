			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Liberal </F> Democratic Party in Russia, in Moscow by ASAHI Newstar  Television political commentator Soichiro Tahara from Tokyo via  satellite on the "Sunday Project" program; date not given --  recorded, in Russian with passage-by-passage translation into  Japanese; translated from the Japanese]    [Text] [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, good morning. I would  like to thank you for appearing on our interview program. In  general elections held last December, the Liberal Democracy  Party [LDP] led by you won many seats, triggering a big  sensation around the world. How has Russia changed since the  LDP was formed?    [Zhirinovskiy] Russia has not changed at all since our party  has not been in control of the government. The LDP's advances  in the Duma at the end of the general elections means the  emergence of a patriotic party there. Our party has worked to  release all political prisoners by seeking amnesty for them.  Our party is working to improve the economy. At present, our  party is working to overcome difficulties facing our nation's  economy by helping the government. At the same time, our party  is demanding the replacement of some cabinet members.  Specifically, our party is demanding the replacement of six  cabinet members. Mr. Shakhray, one of the six cabinet members,  has already quit the cabinet. Mr. Kozyrev, whom the Japanese  like, will soon resign as foreign minister. I believe that a  new government will be inaugurated in the fall. In this way,  our party has been influencing Russia's domestic and foreign  policies. Needless to say, our party is directly influencing  the president.    [Tahara] In search of a political truce, President Yeltsin  concluded a national consensus accord with other political  parties on 28 April. We at first thought that the LDP would  reject the president's offer. At present, the Russian Communist  Party and other parties rejected the president's offer. But  your party signed the accord. Why did your party sign that  accord?    [Zhirinovskiy] The truth is just the opposite. Our party  will continue to fight President Yeltsin. Our party has never  stopped the fight even one day. If our party takes a hard-line  stance on the president, the president would challenge our  party. Our party intends to seize power by merely exposing the  president's faults. Our party plans to become the largest party  after giving the president a chance to step down.    [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you are making very soft comments  today. According to the results of recent polls conducted by  Russian newspapers, the popularity rating of you and your party  is falling. What is your opinion?    [Zhirinovskiy] Poll results are faked. The influence of me  and my party is growing across the nation. If a correspondent  from your TV station visits a Russian town with me, he would  instantly see this. I plan to visit a town in Moscow next  Sunday. If the correspondent from your station visits the town  with me, he would find how much influence I have. Russian TV  and newspaper reports are 90 percent false. You would see this  if you recall what the Russian media reported before and after  the 12 December general elections. I know that the best party  is mine. You are speaking based on false figures and  information. To be honest, the most powerful party in Russia is  the LDP. As a politician, I am in a leading position. In  Russia, no politician can stand shoulder to shoulder with me.  Therefore, Russian politicians fear and slander the LDP. Japan  also is slandering our party.    [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, you visited such European nations  as France and Poland. During your stay in those nations, you  made radical and nationalistic statements. You were expelled  from Bulgaria and Slovenia for such statements. Why did you  make such radical statements?    [Zhirinovskiy] I have never intended to worsen Russia's  relations with other nations. The Bulgarian Government probably  did not like me, but thousands of Bulgarians welcomed me,  throwing flowers at me and kissing my hands. What is important  to me was the Bulgarian people. To speak of Poland, I had no  problem in Poland. The Polish people warmly greeted me. Many  nations have invited me to visit. It is true that I have caused  troubles. The LDP is a new party. I think that some nations  still do not understand what sort of policies the LDP pursues  and what sort of party it is. It is true that an international  organization is moving to block the LDP from expanding its  influence at home and abroad. I do not like to cause trouble.    [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, are you satisfied with Russia's  current borderlines with other nations? Or are you thinking of  further expanding Russia's current borders?    [Zhirinovskiy] The Soviet Union's former borderlines must be  Russia's borderlines. Our party holds this idea. I think that  Russia needs to change its borderlines to strengthen its  security. There is no problem with Russia's borderlines in the  Far East. There also is no problem with Russia's borderlines to  the north, but there is a problem with Russia's borderlines to  the west. The problem with Russia's borders in the west can be  resolved in an economic way. The three Baltic nations,  Byelarus, and Ukraine will return to Russia sometime in the  future. To the south, however, war is raging in the Caucasus  and Central Asia. Islamic forces cannot be taken lightly and  the interests of major nations are intertwined in the region.  We need to draw new borderlines in this region to keep the  region from posing any threat to Russia.    [Tahara] Looking at President Yeltsin's foreign policy, it  is said that he has usurped Zhirinovskiy's policy of pursuing a  superpower. What is your opinion?    [Zhirinovskiy] I and President Yeltsin have many areas of  agreement. I am now on good terms with him. I believe that the  time will come when the president will dismiss cabinet members  our party opposes and our party's platform will become Russia's  platform.    [Tahara] Are you joking?    [Zhirinovskiy] No, I am not joking because the Russian  Government has been changing its domestic and foreign policies  little by little.    [Tahara] Who do you think you will succeed President  Yeltsin?    [Zhirinovskiy] I intend to run in the presidential election  if and when it is held. There is no other candidate to compete  with President Yeltsin in the election. All other Russian  politicians are weak and cowardly. The presidential election  can be sooner if Mr. Yeltsin wants to hold it sooner. If Mr.  Yeltsin does not hope to advance the presidential election, it  will be held 12 June 1996. A new president will be chosen in the  election. I assume that the presidential elections could be  held earlier.    [Tahara] Mr. Zhirinovskiy, how are you going to deal with  Japan? What do you think of Japan?    [Zhirinovskiy] I think we can build up a special  relationship with Japan. Although Japan is an advanced nation,  it is in need of raw materials. Russia has abundant raw  materials. Also, Japan is seeking a positive solution to the  northern territorial dispute between the two countries. But you  cannot expect the settlement of this dispute if Japan negotiates  with the Communist Party or reformists.    [Tahara] What do you think of the northern territorial  issue?    [Zhirinovskiy] Whomever we negotiate with, we will give  nothing. But there is an option that will satisfy Japan. I  myself have explained this option several times to Japanese  people, including the Japanese news media. We will never give  away the islands for nothing. But if Japan shows its  understanding about Russia's plan to draw new boundaries in the  Mediterranean and the Indian Sea, where war is currently being  waged, I think we can offer a reasonable and well-balanced  solution that will satisfy Japan.    We have a problem in the south. We need new boundaries in  areas south of Russia, including the Caucasus, Central Asia,  Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan. If Japan takes sides with us or  adopts a neutral position on this issue, we will be able to pay  more attention to the northern territorial dispute. If Russia  acquires new territories in the south with Japan's help, no one  in Russia will oppose the Kremlin's proposal that the northern  territorial issue be settled on favorable terms to Japan. In  this case, we can protect the two nations' interests. Russia  can protect its interests in the Mediterranean, while Japan can  protect its interests in the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk,  and the Pacific Ocean.    [Tahara] Do you mean that depending on terms, Russia might  possibly return the northern territories to Japan?    [Zhirinovskiy] I cannot answer your question because what we  discuss here will be heard by millions of people and people in  other countries. Negotiations on this matter should be made in  a place where secrecy can be maintained. This is not a matter  to be discussed on a TV program. We should discuss this issue  in a place where secrecy can be maintained and while looking at  maps. Reviewing historical facts, each side should submit their  options for the solution. We will then discuss the options'  good points. This should satisfy Japan.    By the way, I am planning to visit Pyongyang in August this  year. It is not far from Pyongyang to Japan. So, how about my  visiting Tokyo at that time and discussing in detail this issue?  I do not want to fly to the Far East twice. As you know, it  takes nine hours by plane. Let us discuss it at a different  place. I do not mind discussing it at the Defense Agency or the  Foreign Ministry or at a government special service agency.    [Tahara] Let me confirm what you have just said. You want  to visit Japan and you are asking me to make arrangements for  the visit. Am I right?    [Zhirinovskiy] I can visit Hiroshima and Nagasaki on 6 and  10 August to show that I am pro-Japanese. I think the United  States' atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a cruel  criminal act. I think it is not so bad for the Japanese to hear  the leader of the largest party in Russia calling for solidarity  between the two nations.</p>

			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / International Company News: Telebras prepares to raise Dollars 500m in ADRs TELEBRAS, Brazil's state-owned telecommunications holding company, is preparing to raise Dollars 500m in American depositary receipts later this year. The company said that before launching the ADRs it would make an unspecified sum of additional shares available for trading on the US over-the-counter market. Telebras shares began trading on the over-the-counter market last year. The projected Dollars 500m in new equity will probably not be placed on the market in a single operation, said Mr Joaquim Barao de Assumpcao, assistant finance director. The company sent an official statement to the local stock markets to clarify a report in the financial daily Gazeta Mercantil that made the offering of Dollars 500m appear imminent. The ADR operation is awaiting approval by the US Securities and Exchange Commission which is seeking accounting adjustments to the company's balance sheet to bring its figures into line with US standards. Telebras is looking for sources of new capital to fund its investment goal of Dollars 3.5bn this year. It plans to increase the number of telephone lines in the country from 10.5m to 11.7m this year, with a goal of 15m by 1995. If Telebras raises new capital through an ADR operation, it will become the second Brazilian company to make a new equity placement abroad. In May 1992, pulp producer Aracruz raised Dollars 132.5m in new equity on the American market.</p>

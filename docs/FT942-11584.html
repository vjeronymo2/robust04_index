			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Nationwide chief to head IoD Mr Tim Melville-Ross, who was named yesterday as the next director-general of the Institute of Directors, said he would 'push hard on the issue of corporate governance'. 'The debate has tilted too far towards control and away from enterprise and initiative,' he said. 'Directors need to be imaginative to be wealth-creating.' Mr Melville-Ross, chief executive of Nationwide Building Society, is to succeed Mr Peter Morgan at the IoD on August 1. Mr Melville-Ross, 49, spent 10 years with British Petroleum before joining Nationwide as secretary in 1974. He has been Nationwide's chief executive for almost 10 years and was chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders from 1992 to 1993. 'My first priority is quite clear, and that is to make sure that the institute is doing everything that it should be for its 48,000 members,' he said yesterday. 'I will also be pushing hard on the issue of corporate governance.' On policy issues he emphasised that his agenda would be shaped by the needs and desires of his members rather than any preconceptions that he might hold. He was emphatic on the need to pursue the aim of de-regulation, however. 'This is our aim in Europe,' he said. 'We are not little Englanders. We want to be in Europe, but I have very grave concerns about the notion of a federal Europe. The European Union is already overregulated, overcentralised and very difficult to live with. 'Any suggestions that we should withdraw from Europe altogether - maybe through some kind of loose free trade alliance - are going too far. We need to be a part of Europe in order to convince governments and companies of the need for free enterprise.' Mr Melville-Ross points to the 1996 intergovernmental conference as a possible focal point for the IoD's drive to reduce European regulation. Closer to home, he is keen to see an easing of the regulation of financial services. 'There is a danger of too much and inappropriate regulation constraining the range of services and products and raising the costs of those services that remain to a level that customers cannot afford. 'I appreciate that public confidence is at stake, but I am in favour of self-regulation rather than statutory regulation.' Mr Melville-Ross also disputes the notion that the IoD has become outdated. 'If by old-fashioned, our critics mean the institute's commitment to virtues such as hard work, personal initiative and enterprise, then I make no apologies for that. But if they mean that we are out of touch with modern thinking, they are absolutely wrong.' Mr Melville-Ross has been appointed on an initial three-year contract. His salary of Pounds 180,000 represents an increase on Mr Morgan's Pounds 148,000. Nationwide chief, Page 28</p>

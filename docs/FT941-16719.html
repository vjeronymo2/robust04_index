			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Still chairman of the board / Assessing the security and economic agenda Bill Clinton has set for his first trip to Europe as US president This weekend Bill Clinton sets foot on European soil for the first time since he became president 50 weeks ago. Before the year is out he is due to return to the continent two or three more times. If 1993 was the year of the domestic focus, with the foreign spotlight swivelling intermittently towards distant trouble spots and more consistently towards Asia, then the 1994 stage seems to have been arranged to give Europe the opportunity to reclaim what it has long considered its rightful place in the forefront of America's external security considerations. At least this is the hypothesis and it has been reflected in a torrent of analysis in Washington this week, both by the administration and its critics. If words were all, then Europeans could be excused for thinking Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, never said, as he pungently did last autumn, that one of the problems of US foreign policy is that it had been too Eurocentric for too long. Certainly the immediate Clinton mission is weighty. He will outline his vision for Europe in a Brussels speech tomorrow night. The Nato summit will debate the future shape and purpose of the alliance and the eventual widening of its security net to countries to its east; and a session with the European Union will discuss how best to extend economic benefits and assistance. In Prague, the president must explain to the leaders of Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics why Nato's doors will not be immediately opened to them. In Moscow he has the difficult task of telling President Boris Yeltsin that resurgent Russian nationalism is neither conducive to greater European security nor helpful to continued US leadership in assisting the cause of Russian domestic reform. If Mr Yeltsin is in a defensive mode, which would be understandable, then Mr Clinton will need to be at his most creative and persuasive if he wants to avoid embarrassment. In less tangible but equally important ways, Mr Clinton must also convince the heads of the governments of Western Europe, whose recent individual and collective leadership has been more conspicuous for its absence, that the US will remain thoroughly engaged. It may be debated whether the US president or his European counterparts are most to blame for any mutual lack of confidence - he because he has been otherwise engaged and because of Bosnia, and they because most would have preferred a second term for George Bush and because one of their governing parties, the British Tories, worked against Mr Clinton's election. On the US side, there does appear to be a determination to put the western European relationship on a better footing. Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, claims there is little wrong with it, that his president has met in Washington as many European leaders as did Mr Bush in his first year and that, because diplomacy is not a zero sum game, the evolution of what he calls the first coherent US Asian policy in decades means no downgrading of the European priority. The Uruguay Round agreement is held up as a model: the US and Europe burying their hatchets for the common good and not into each other. Mr Lake often refers to one of his own few public speeches, delivered last September under the title From Containment to Enlargement and devoted to the proposition that the 'core' democracies (the US, western Europe and Japan) have a special obligation to work together for a more democratic and prosperous world. Western European diplomats based in Washington also generally take a more relaxed view about the state of transatlantic relations than their head offices back home apparently do. The British embassy, for example, is particularly grateful for US support over the latest Northern Ireland initiative and the French for being allowed to declare victory in the Uruguay Round, though there have been some communications problems with Germany over Somalia and Iran. UK diplomats are also pleased with the pre-Nato consultations and are convinced the summit will go smoothly, in spite of French attempts to give a higher profile to the latest deterioration in Bosnia. Still, it would be pointless to pretend that the general perception is all of smooth sailing. Jim Hoagland's Washington Post column this week was closer to the mark in its observation that 'what is missing is the day-to-day sense of trust and clear private communications that guided the Atlantic relationship through far more difficult times in the past'. The reason for this at the highest levels may be obvious - Mr Clinton and his European counterparts share few cold war experiences - but that does not mean its absence makes life any easier. The emphasis on economic security apart, the constant of Clinton's foreign policy bearing most clearly on Europe is its devotion to the cause of reform in Russia. The resurgence of Russian nationalism evident in last month's elections and reflected in statements by Mr Yeltsin's government ever since has led to something of a reappraisal, both of Nato's evolution and the desired pace and extent of reform in Russia itself. On Nato's development, an earlier, instinctive sympathy held by Mr Christopher and Mr Lake to extending membership sooner rather than later to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic seems to have lost out to the strongly held convictions of Strobe Talbott. The rising star of the Clinton foreign policy team believes this would undermine Mr Yeltsin and boost the nationalists. This does, however, over-simplify a complex Washington policy debate. Critical objections to making Nato instantly bigger were also advanced by the US military, the alliance's most vital component. The Pentagon was not only concerned with the complications of absorbing military forces of which it knew too little, but also by the security implications of sharing operational knowledge with countries whose political futures as western-inclined democracies could not be assured (Hungary, for example). The compromise, known as the 'Partnership for Peace', is based on creating 'habits of co-operation' that could make eventual membership less troublesome. On Russian reform, too, administration thinking has been fluid over the past month. The initial lesson drawn by Vice-President Al Gore and Mr Talbott after Russia's elections was that the country needed 'less shock and more therapy'. That has now been amended. This week President Clinton spoke of 'more reform and more therapy, more attempts to build a safety net to deal with the consequences of reform but not an attempt to slow down the reform effort'. In Washington political terms, this is a vindication of the approach of the Treasury, specifically for Lloyd Bentsen, the secretary, and Larry Summers, in charge of international affairs. On Monday Mr Summers said in Boston it would be a 'grave mistake' to think there was some 'third way' for making reform in Russia less painful. As it is, the US ability to pour vast extra resources behind reform is limited and Congress is unlikely to add to the Dollars 2.5bn in bilateral assistance voted last year. The focus instead will be on disbursing money to areas most in need, for which there should be leeway as only Dollars 3bn of the Dollars 28bn G7 support programme agreed last year has been actually delivered. Both the plans for Nato and the reassessment of the approach to Russia have stoked the fires of public debate. This is not only because eastern European leaders such as presidents Lech Walesa and Vaclav Havel, both immensely respected in the US, have been so critical (though this did prompt the administration to send a team to eastern Europe, including General John Shalikashvili, new chairman of the joints chiefs of staff, for some smoothing of the presidential path). A typical critique came from Robert Zoellick, undersecretary of state in the Bush administration, who wrote this week that the problem with 'Partnership for Peace' was its lack of substantive criteria for admitting new members to Nato. 'We should aim to bring these democracies into Nato at about the same time they enter the European Union,' in his view over the next three to six years. The Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal this week broadly agreed. Brent Scowcroft and Richard Haass, respectively the head and a senior member of the Bush national security council, thought, in a doom-laden column, US foreign policy was approaching 'a point of peril'. They doubted a formal expansion of Nato was necessary, but advocated a much tougher US line towards Russia ('We have to make clear that our long-term support is not unconditional and will depend on Russia's adherence to political and economic reforms and restraint towards its neighbours') and less severe cuts in US defence spending. Mr Clinton's response has been careful, acknowledging US concerns about Russian sensibilities. 'The signal that Yeltsin sent to me,' he said, 'is that he did not want to feel that Russia was being isolated, was being moved back into a sort of potential enemy status.' Similarly, he hoped the 'limited' Nato approach to eastern Europe would work 'because we don't want them to feel threatened by an eastern pull any more, but neither do we want to prejudge the future intentions and policies of Russia and other countries in the newly independent states, especially Ukraine'. The overall goal for Europe, east and west, including Russia, should be the emergence of a more integrated political and economic system, Mr Clinton said. A good start in this direction was for the US 'to make as forceful an argument as is possible that the Europeans ought to trade more with them'. As an example, White House officials pointed out, the US has removed some cold war statutes limiting trade with the eastern bloc, as promised to Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver last year. Still under review is repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment governing the granting of most favoured nation trading status to Russia (it now receives an annual waiver). Strobe Talbott said Mr Clinton would, in effect, be offering more European countries 'shareholding' rights in the form of 'an arrangement and a mechanism that will give all of the states . . . an important say in what the post-cold war security order looks like'. By this yardstick, the US will remain chairman of the board, but Bill Clinton's Year of Europe, starting tomorrow, is predicated on the other executive directors pulling their weight.</p>

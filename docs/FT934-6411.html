			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Former Tory council chiefs 'delayed' probe Labour yesterday accused two former Conservative leaders of Westminster city council of delaying an independent report to limit the impact in next year's London local elections. Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said in two Commons motions that a report being compiled by Mr John Magill, the district auditor, had been delayed seven times. The motions say that some Conservative councillors have followed a 'deliberate strategy' of causing 'as much hindrance to the district auditor as they can'. They accuse Dame Shirley Porter and Mr David Weeks, both former leaders of the council, of trying to delay the report long enough to avoid discussion of the contents before the May elections. Dame Shirley and Mr Weeks are said to have sought to force the district auditor 'to use his formal powers' and to have used 'other delaying tactics'. Mr Magill is investigating Labour claims, repeated in the motions, that the council sold housing estates with the intention of 'gerrymandering the electoral composition of key marginal wards'. Mr Weeks said the delays were a matter for the auditor. 'I categorically deny that any of the delays have been caused by anything that I have done,' he said. Dame Shirley was not available for comment. Labour says that an influx of homeowners helped the Conservatives to win 45 of the council's 60 seats in the last elections in 1990, compared with the 32 they held in 1989. The report, expected to contain about 14,000 pages of evidence, is set to be published next year, about 10 months after the original scheduled publication date. Labour believes, however, that the most politically damaging developments for the Conservatives will come in a series of hearings which will follow publication. The respondents' right to legal representation means that hearings are unlikely to start until several months after the report appears. Mr Straw did not criticise Mr Magill but he called for a firm date for publication to prevent further delays. Mr Peter Bradley, Westminster council's deputy Labour leader, said the government would not have tolerated such delays during an investigation into a Labour council. Mr Bradley also accused the council of withholding information from Labour councils. 'Westminster city council is a law unto itself,' he said.</p>

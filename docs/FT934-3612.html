			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Arts: The Boston plays Berlioz - Concert The usual formula for a visiting orchestra is to bring a showpiece as an advertisement for its virtuosity and a short work by a living composer back home to display its patriotism. On Saturday the Boston Symphony Orchestra reached London on its European tour with a rather more enterprising programme. By accident, this became a Berlioz weekend. While the Barbican was embarking on its long-awaited series of concert performances of Les Troyens, offering the two parts of that epic opera on consecutive days before putting them together next Sunday, the Royal Festival Hall found itself in a position to counter with another two-part Berlioz rarity - the Symphonie fantastique performed with its sequel, Lelio. The symphony is a favourite of the Boston orchestra and its Music Director, Seiji Ozawa. They made a showpiece of it, as the occasion demanded. (Years of working with Ozawa have clarified every inner part in this complex score, allowing countless details in the wind and brass to come through.) But it was also a performance that gave full rein to Berlioz's fevered imagination, culminating in an eerie and violent dance at the witches' sabbath. That last movement brings many a visiting orchestra's concert to an exciting close. By putting the symphony in the first half and following it with the strange Lelio, as the composer did, Ozawa allowed the focus of the evening to be turned away from the orchestra and on to Berlioz himself. The stage lights went down and a spotlight picked out Lambert Wilson, who was to speak his words in this uniquely personal monologue with music. Unlike most composers, Berlioz felt the need to express himself in writing. His diaries show an inspired and original mind at work, but I am less sure about the stream of artistic self-pity that pours out of Lelio. Berlioz may come across as a more sensitive person than Richard Strauss does in his appallingly arrogant self-portrait in Ein Heldenleben, but at least Strauss composed a cogent musical defence. The score of Lelio comprises half-a-dozen short and unconnected pieces, for which one suspects Berlioz wanted to find a home. At this concert the unlikely melange worked, thanks to the high standard of the performance all-round. Vinson Cole was marvellously poetic in the tenor's 'Song of bliss'. Francois Le Roux, the idiomatic baritone, made a lively brigand. The Brighton Festival Chorus excelled itself in the closing Fantasia on Shakespeare's 'The Tempest'. Above all, Ozawa and the Boston musicians created marvels of orchestral delicacy and refinement, enough perhaps to make Lelio a showpiece as well. Boston Symphony Orchestra tour sponsored by NEC</p>

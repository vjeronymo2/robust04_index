			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAS NEVES' EDGE IS NO HELP ON THE HILL  </P> <P> Helix's Daniel Das Neves appears to have a built-in advantage over his  cross-country competitors. He is a Brazilian exchange student whose American  host happens to be Luis de Oliveira.  </P> <P> De Oliveira, also a native of Brazil, is considered the top middle-distance  coach in the United States. He has trained Mary Slaney and currently works with  Joaquim Cruz and Ocky Clark.  </P> <P> At the Section cross-country championships Saturday, Das Neves maintained a  step advantage over San Pasqual's Robert Walker during the Division II race as  the two approached the Upas Street hill, upon which most Morley Field  cross-country races are won.  </P> <P> So guess who kicked and left the other nine seconds behind at the finish line?  The guy without a professional coach.  </P> <P> Walker raced past Das Neves on the hill, opened a 25-yard lead and maintained  it for the final half-mile to finish the three-mile course in 15 minutes 27  seconds, the fastest time of the day. Das Neves came in at 15:36.  </P> <P> "I was pretty scared," Walker said afterward. "Because I had never raced (Das  Neves) before and I didn't know what he can do. Nobody does."  </P> <P> That's more accurate than Walker might have thought because Das Neves still  isn't sure what he's capable of. In fact, he said, the best runner might not  have won Saturday's race.  </P> <P> "I think I am (a better runner)," Das Neves said. "The only thing is, I'm not  in shape yet. I was just running with one pace. I only have one speed, and  today I couldn't shift gears."  </P> <P> Das Neves is bothered by a sore left Achilles' tendon, but said the injury is  improving. Das Neves expects to do some speed workouts this week, which will  help his kick at the state meet.  </P> <P> "Now I'm feeling real good," he said, "so I'll probably do better next week."  </P> <P> The best time for girls also came in Division II. Fallbrook sophomore Milena  Glusac finished the 2.5-mile course in 14:30, 42 seconds faster than what she  turned in last year when she won as a freshman.  </P></p>

As known, in the contact prior to this, we had  put forth a new rational proposal which can open a breakthrough  in the current deadlock in the DPRK-U.S. talks. In this regard,  officials of the United States had made positive assessments.    Nevertheless, in the 10 December contact, the U.S. side came  forth with an alternative which denies our proposal. The U.S.  side practiced magic as if its alternative was progressive, but  as the spokesman of the White House officially proclaimed that  there is absolutely no change in the U.S. position, in essence  there is nothing new in the alternative.    Considering the fact that the U.S. side said that it will  accept our package deal method, we showed the maximum generosity  we can carry out at the current stage. Nevertheless, when  viewing the fact that the United States is continuing to insist  on such an unjust position, we cannot but doubt whether it truly  wants to resolve the nuclear issue or whether it is pursuing the  plot to crush [apsal] us by finding fault with the nuclear  issue, even though on the surface it is saying that it wants to  resolve the nuclear issue through dialogue.    Moreover, the reason that it was inevitable for us to be  suspicious about the agenda of the talks by the United States is  that it continued to come forth with the issue of exchanging  special envoys of the North and South as a precondition for  holding the three-stage talks, which has no relation to the  DPRK-U.S. talks, and intentionally delayed the resolution of the  nuclear issue.    We presented a momentous proposal to accept the inspection  by  the International Atomic Energy Agency necessary to ensure the  continuity of safeguards, a proposal commensurate with our  special position of tentatively suspending the validation of the  withdrawal from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, out of our  basic stand to resolve the nuclear issue at source through the  DPRK- U.S. talks.    We cannot but be surprised at the fact that the United  States  is laying artificial obstacles again by linking the exchange of  special envoys between the North and the South, an internal  affair of our nation, with the nuclear issue in a far-fetched  manner at a time when the prospects of a negotiated solution of  the nuclear issue are in sight. If this is prompted by a change  in the U.S. policy, we also must prudently reconsider our  position toward dialogue [urido yoksi taehwae taehan uriui  ipchangul sinjunghi koryohaeboji anulsu opta].    If the United States is thus not interested in the progress  of dialogue and resort continuously to the tactics of pressure  and delay, even if the third round of talks is held, we can  hardly expect the package solution to be agreed on there. We  cannot but be on our guard, in particular, because the United  States, saying that this counterproposal is agreed on with its  allies, is taking an attitude of putting pressure in the manner  of delivering an ultimatum, saying that if we do not accept it,  it will take the issue to the United Nations.    If the United States behaves unjustly as it does,  threatening  our existence, thereby losing the last chance for resolving the  nuclear issue through talks, it will be the United States that  will regret it after all.    Our position is clear. It depends entirely on the attitude  of the United States whether the third round of talks is held  and the nuclear issue is resolved.</p>

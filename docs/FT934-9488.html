			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Recession erodes Seiko and Citizen JAPANESE watchmakers, which once seemed set to dominate world markets, are being slowed as profits are badly eroded by recession and a high yen. Seiko, Japan's leading watchmaker and a world-renowned brand, plunged into loss, while Citizen, its main Japanese competitor, saw pre-tax profits decline 17 per cent. Japanese consumers have been discouraged from buying new watches by the recession, and corporate buying of gifts has declined. Against this environment, Seiko reported a pre-tax loss of Y3.21bn (Dollars 29.7m) in the first half, against a profit of Y1.6bn previously. Turnover for the watchmaker was 11 per cent down, to Y121.84bn from Y137.41bn. Sales at Citizen also came under pressure, but the company managed a moderate increase in turnover, to Y124.23bn from a previous Y123.78bn. Pre-tax profits, however, were 17 per cent down to Y6.29bn against Y7.58bn. The outlook remains poor for the watchmakers, and both Seiko and Citizen are expecting a drop in full-year sales. Seiko is forecasting a 4 per cent decline in sales, to Y258bn, and a pre-tax loss of Y4bn. Citizen, meanwhile, is expecting to report a 9 per cent decline in sales, to Y230bn, and a 41 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y10bn.</p>

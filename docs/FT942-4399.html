			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Finland heads for icy waters over EU entry Finland's plans to enter the European Union on January 1 next year could be upset if the centre-right coalition loses a parliamentary no-confidence vote next week, Mr Esko Aho, prime minister, said yesterday. His comments, coming as tensions grow in the government over EU issues, were a clear attempt to head off threats by some members of coalition parties to vote against the government. Finland is due to enter the EU next year along with Austria, Norway and Sweden if the country votes to join in a referendum set for October. But Mr Aho said that if the coalition fell, the timetable for membership would be delayed. 'I predict this will mean Finland cannot become a member at the same time as the other Efta (European Free Trade Area) countries that have applied for membership,' he said. Most observers expect the coalition will survive narrowly. But the rows over the EU that have broken out within and between the government parties have threatened to undermine the campaign for a Yes vote in October. Finland is the only one of the three Nordic countries where the Yes side leads the No camp. The main dispute within the government is between Mr Aho's rurally-based Centre party and the Conservative party. Mr Pertti Salolainen, the trade minister and a key figure in Finland's accession negotiations with the EU earlier this year, has resigned as Conservative party leader in protest at his failure to win Centre party approval for tax cuts as a price for Conservative approval of a FM4bn (Pounds 483m) package to help farmers adjust to EU prices. The anti-EU Finnish Christian party has threatened to leave the coalition and Mr Aho's position is made more difficult by the strong current of anti-EU feeling in his own party. He badly needs the farm support package to help him win the official backing of the Centre party for EU membership in a party congress on the issue due next week. In Sweden, meanwhile, an opinion poll showed opposition to the EU slipping, but still leading the Yes campaign. The No camp slid by 4.8 points to 40 per cent since a similar poll last November, while support rose by 4.5 per cent to 30.5 per cent.</p>

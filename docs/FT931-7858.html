			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Survey of Vehicle Fleet Management (18): Steep descent - UK gloom as Leyland Daf collapses THE UK car and commercial vehicle markets have begun to show tentative signs of recovery from the depth of recession, but the recent improvement in registrations remains weak. UK new car sales rose year-on-year by 7 per cent in January, while registrations of new commercial vehicles rose by 4.4 per cent, in both cases the fourth consecutive month in which registrations had been higher than in the corresponding period a year earlier. The collapse into receivership this month of Daf, the beleaguered Anglo-Dutch truck maker which is also the clear UK truck market leader, has served as a grim reminder, however, of the strength of the recessionary pressures. Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost in the motor industry in Britain in the past three years, reflecting the steep drop in demand for new vehicles. From peak sales of 2.3m in 1989 new car sales in the UK have plunged by 31 per cent to only 1.59m in both 1991 and 1992. During the same period sales of new commercial vehicles dropped by 45.8 per cent from 371,104 in 1989 to only 201,186 in 1992, while sales of trucks, the sector worst affected by recession, have more than halved with a 54.6 per cent decline to only 31,398 in 1992 from 69,234 in 1989. Established vehicle makers in the UK have been forced to reduce drastically their capacity and implement severe cuts in their workforces. Last year AWD, the small privately-owned truck maker that had been formed from the rump of the loss-making Bedford truck operations in the second half of the 1980s, went into receivership. Renault Vehicules Industriels, the French commercial vehicle maker, has decided to cease truck assembly at its plant at Dunstable, while UK operations of Leyland Daf, the leading British truck maker, are in the balance. The Daf parent company filed for protection from its creditors earlier this month, while Leyland Daf, its UK subsidiary, has collapsed into administrative receivership. Already the receivers have made redundant 30 per cent of Leyland Daf's 5,500-strong workforce. More job cuts appear inevitable and it is unclear how much of the Leyland Daf operations can be salvaged. In the car industry Rover, Jaguar, Rolls-Royce Motor Cars and Ford of Britain have all been operating with substantial losses. The Jaguar UK workforce has been sharply reduced to only 6,481 at the end of 1992 from 7,520 a year earlier and 11,661 at the end of 1990. Ford of Europe is currently cutting another 10,000 jobs across Europe, with the UK bearing a significant part of the contraction. Ford's UK workforce had already fallen from a peak of 80,000 in early 1980 to only 33,000 by the end of 1992. In the motor dealer sector the Retail Motor Industry Federation said last month that a further 7 to 8 per cent of the UK's remaining 7,000 franchised motor dealers would close or be sold off this year. Last year 8 per cent closed or were sold off following 10 per cent in 1991. As the recession deepened vehicle makers have been forced to undertake increasingly desperate measures to try to stimulate sales with an array of financial incentives and deep discounting, but often the actions have only served to increase losses. As retail sales continued to fall last year, it was the fleet sector of the UK car market that sustained sales, and meant that the market finally remained unchanged from 1991 at 1.59m. The share of sales to fleets (defined as operators of 25 vehicles and above) accounted for 41.8 per cent of the UK new car market last year compared with 39.2 per cent a year earlier. Opinions now differ as to how well the recovery in demand in recent months can be maintained. Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said that the January sales figures suggested that 'a sustained recovery' in the market could well be under way. The growth in sales in January - in contrast to previous months - was entirely due to a higher level of purchases by private customers rather than by company fleets, he said. Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff Business School, cautions against optimism based on the January sales figures, however. 'Last month's car figures were in fact dreadful', he says. 'The previous January was very poor, being 11.7 per cent down on the 1990 figure. But since then the 10 per cent special car tax has been abolished. That should should have lifted last month's market by 12 per cent on its own. 'The extent to which the market is up shows the recession is still there and that people remain very cautious about buying,' he said. Sales of Japanese makes in January were 32.9 per cent higher than a year ago, which boosted their share to 11.2 per cent from 9.0 per cent a year earlier. Sales of Japanese cars will be boosted this year by growing output from the new Toyota and Honda plants in the UK which opened late last year. The first cars from Toyota's Pounds 700m plant at Burnaston near Derby were registered in January, and the pattern of the supply of Japanese cars to the UK is becoming increasingly complex. Both Toyota and Honda are now shipping cars to the UK from their plants in the US, while Nissan and Suzuki also supply some vehicles to the UK from plants in Spain. Nissan, Toyota and Honda all have car assembly and engine plants in the UK.</p>

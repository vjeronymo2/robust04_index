			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicators, the most widely used overall guide to the course of the wool market,on February 12 reached 597 cents a Kg., exactly back to the closing level reached at the end of last season. Prices for some wools are well above that basis and others fall far short of it, but there is no doubt that the wool market is now seen as nearly certain to reach new peaks in the free market era. Demand is particularly strong for middle range categories, where drought has supplemented production cuts by farmers.</p>

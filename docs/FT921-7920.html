			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: BP board changes 'unconnectedwith results' SEVERAL CHANGES to the main board of British Petroleum were announced yesterday, a move which will strengthen the role of executive directors. BP will also get its first female director. The changes were triggered in part by the departure yesterday of Mr James Ross, the managing director in charge of BP's US operations, to become chief executive of Cable and Wireless. Mr Ray Knowland, another managing director, is leaving having exceeded retirement age. Sir Campbell Fraser, a non-executive director, is retiring after 14 years on the board. In their place, BP is appointing three executive directors, Mr Steve Ahearne, chief financial officer, Mr Rodney Chase, who will take over Mr Ross' US responsibilities, and Mr Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals. A new non-executive director is Ms Karen Horn, chairman and chief executive of Banc One, the Cleveland banking group. She will become the first woman to penetrate the BP boardroom. The changes mean that all BP's principal divisional heads now have seats on the board under Mr Robert Horton, chairman and chief executive. Last year, Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, and Mr Russell Seal, chief executive of BP Oil, were made managing directors. The changes give BP eight executive directors and nine non-executive. BP said the changes were unconnected with last week's poor set of 1991 results. BP denied at the time that there had been any divisions in the board over dividend policy. See Lex</p>

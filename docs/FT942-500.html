			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Package targets four economic sectors The Japanese government's third deregulation package of the past year is more concrete in content than its predecessors, but woollier in its timing. No action can be taken on the 279 regulations it schedules for review or abolition until the package is approved by the cabinet. That depends on the speed with which a new government can be conjured from the present political wrangling between Japan's three main political blocs. Mr Eijiro Hata, minister of international trade and industry, predicted, however, the next cabinet would adopt the package without changes. So the plan is a statement of good intentions. It lacks details of an extension of the present one-year income tax cut, put on hold since last weekend's collapse of the government. 'That is now up to discussions between parties,' said a government official. As such, the package is likely to earn the highest praise from the US, which eagerly awaits evidence of progress in stimulating domestic demand and reducing Japan's trade surplus. But once a new government is in place, officials believe 193 regulations will be on the scrap-heap by the end of this year and 36 next year, with the timing of the rest uncertain. Yesterday's deregulation plan covers four main sectors: housing and land, telecommunications, access for imports, and the financial markets. On housing, the most important changes are the acceptance of foreign tests for imported building materials and a relaxation of the restrictive planning zones which are a factor in Japan's cramped urban living conditions. Thanks to zoning laws, an estimated 5 per cent of privately owned land in Tokyo is officially supposed to be for agricultural use. The government has stopped short of easing rules on entry into the telecommunications service market, a disappointment to potential newcomers who had encouraged speculation that the door would be thrown open. However, the plan does promise to clarify approval criteria for new telecommunications services. It intends to ease government price controls on some kinds of telecommunications services and make it easier for private sector telephone services to connect with the public system, a liberalisation step urged by foreign companies. On imports, the plan proposes that foreign safety tests should be more widely accepted on cars, car parts, food, drugs and medical devices coming into Japan. Currently they have to obtain tests from often expensive and overworked Japanese laboratories to qualify for import licences. Japanese technical standards should also be adjusted to international levels in these areas, says the plan. It also calls for more liberal application of the large-scale retail law, which controls the opening of new shops. The package is part of a five-year campaign to purge more than 10,000 official rules and permits which restrain some 40 per cent of the economy. Despite efforts by previous governments to reduce the tangle of red tape, the number of regulations grew for seven years running until 1993. This reflects opposition from some ministries reluctant to see their powers eroded, and protected business sectors, like small distribution companies and corner shops, which are loath to face competition. Government officials now believe the pile has started to shrink, as the political drive for deregulation has started to gain momentum. It is a feature of a gradual liberalisation of the Japanese economy, helped by international competition and the growth of free market thought among the country's biggest businesses. The first two packages of the current deregulation drive, in September and February, condemned 881 rules to abolition. Of that total, 595 - or two thirds - have actually been scrapped. Another 111, requiring legislation, are stuck in a lengthening queue of parliamentary bills, held up by the series of political crises over the past year. More deregulation packages are planned. The Keidanren, which has switched over the past few years to an enthusiastic advocate of deregulation, from its previous conservative defence of vested interests, appeared impressed by the latest step. Mr Geoffrey Barker, chief economist at Baring Securities in Tokyo, added: 'It certainly covers the right areas, but the pace of change will depend on the political will of the next government.' As Mr Hosokawa's deregulation packages show, the hard bit is putting good intentions into practice.</p>

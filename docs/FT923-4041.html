			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Cut in N-power levy ruled out THE GOVERNMENT has ruled out any immediate reduction in the nuclear levy on the electricity industry, in spite of pressure from the electricity regulator. The Department of Trade and Industry, which is now responsible for energy policy, is not even planning to suggest a reduction to the Treasury. It sees little prospect of a cut in the levy because the public spending round is proving so tough. The levy was imposed to subsidise the higher costs of nuclear electricity after the privatisation of the non-nuclear generators in 1990. Any fall in the levy would mean that the financial support it provides for Nuclear Electric, the state-owned company which owns and operates the 12 nuclear power stations in England and Wales, would have to come from the public sector borrowing requirement. This year the levy will amount to Pounds 1.2bn - equivalent to 11 per cent on the electricity bills of every household and company in England and Wales. It is supposed to shrink by stages to Pounds 800m in 1997. This year it was responsible for turning Nuclear Electric's Pounds 783m loss into a Pounds 482m profit. The company's ability to achieve a profit, albeit with the help of the levy, has reinforced the argument of critics who argue that what is effectively a tax on electricity should be reduced. The opponents of the levy are mainly industrialists, headed by large companies such as Imperial Chemical Industries. They have been joined by National Power and PowerGen, the two privately owned electricity generators, and by Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director-general of the Office of Electricity Regulation. Ministers argue, however, that a straight withdrawal of the levy as Nuclear Electric becomes profitable provides little incentive to the manage ment to make the improvements they are confident of attaining under Mr Bob Hawley, the company's new chief executive. Nuclear Electric says that even when it becomes profitable it will still need the support of the levy to make provision for the reactors it inherited when it was formed in 1990. A small proportion of the levy also subsidises renewable forms of energy, such as projects using wind and tides, which ministers are conscious are already facing difficulties because the levy must end in 1998.</p>

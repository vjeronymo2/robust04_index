			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Back to the past for Nigerians as poll result is blocked THERE is a big scoreboard outside the headquarters of Nigeria's National Electoral Commission (NEC) in Abuja, put there to display the results of last Saturday's presidential election. It is blank. Like the federal capital of Abuja itself, the first general elections for a decade have consumed a lot of time and money but look as though they will never be completed. On Wednesday, the NEC announced it had been restrained from publishing the election results by a court ruling. There was stunned disbelief, and the suspicion that Nigerians had been duped once again by a military regime that has hung on to power a little too long. Three times since 1991, President Ibrahim Babangida has delayed the transition to democracy, now scheduled for August 27 - the eighth anniversary of his seizure of power. 'Two years ago I would not have believed this possible in Nigeria, it was something that happened in other African states, but we've had so many changes that Nigerians have become docile,' said a businessman in Lagos, the commercial capital. The mood of the Yoruba, who dominate the Social Democratic Party's stronghold in the south-west, has turned from celebration of the expected success of their own man, Mr Mashood Abiola, to outrage at the legal sophistry which may deny him victory. Among the decrees passed by President Babangida in recent months was an electoral law giving the NEC overall responsibility for the running of the elections, without interference from any court. 'Babangida took power by force, playing martial music and telling Nigerians to stay calm,' said a young trader from Edo state in the mid-west. 'He didn't worry about law courts and judges in those days. I just don't think he wants to go.' Although victory for Mr Abiola could mean a shift of power to the south, northern Nigerians also regard the belated vote-rigging allegations by the rival National Republican Convention (NRC) with contempt. 'What was there to rig? I passed one polling station on Saturday where the election officials outnumbered the voters,' said one northern chieftain. 'Most people still thought the election was off on Saturday. It said so the day before on the Hausa service of the BBC.' The indignation cuts across party lines: 'The SDP is not my party, but Abiola won it fairly and he should get his chance,' said one NRC supporter from Delta state. 'A lot of people don't care if it's Abiola or Tofa (the NRC candidate). They just want a change.' Nigeria is run down. Strikes have hit schools and hospitals, rubbish piles up in the streets of the Lagos business district, power cuts and water shortages are common, drains and roads are collapsing, and armed robbery is unchecked by an incompetent and demoralised police force. During recent fuel shortages, the prices of basic goods and public transport in Lagos rose by up to 200 per cent and have yet to come down. Outside the Central Bank of Nigeria, which has halved the value of the naira in the past year, black market traders sell the currency for 60 per cent less. If uncertainty over the election continues, they will mark the naira down further.</p>

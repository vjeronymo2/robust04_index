			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Vasilyev under the heading </F> ``Aspects'': ``An Invisible Chernobyl -- Created by Nature  Itself'']    [Text] Everyone is arguing about ``radiation.'' But the  manmade danger is just one part of the problem. People talk and  write much less frequently, more quietly and less clearly about  the other part -- the fact that natural sources of ionizing  radiation account for approximately 70 percent of the total  radiation to which people are exposed.    That comparisons between Chernobyl and the radioactive  effects of natural radiation sources are not exaggerated is  demonstrated by the fact that the collective radiation to which  Russia's population is exposed from natural sources is 300 times  greater than radiation exposure resulting from the Chernobyl  accident. The greatest ``contribution'' is made by radon and  products of its decay found in the air inside buildings.  According to a preliminary estimate, approximately 1.5 million  Russians are exposed to 0.6-1.2 rems per year. That means that  the bulk of expected medical effects from radiation among the  public does in fact stem from natural sources. The annual death  rate from this factor may be as high as 25,000.    There is no way that this issue can be viewed either as  unexpected or as a recent discovery. In 1970, almost a quarter  of a century ago, a major series of studies was completed on the  presence of naturally-occurring radionuclides in building  materials, resulting in the establishment of appropriate  construction standards. True, studies of the radiation level at  non-uranium mines and in miners' settlements were conducted  irregularly and unsystematically. It was during this period that  Kazakhstan discovered a unique miners' settlement -- a ``radon  city'' -- where 90 percent of the housing showed dangerous  levels of radon. Out of a total of 150 non-uranium mines, more  than 100 had dangerous radon levels, and radiation exposure at  those enterprises sometimes exceeded levels permissible for  uranium mines. It was also discovered that employees of  enterprises that refine minerals are also exposed to radiation  from natural sources. The radiation level in oil- and  gas-producing areas was also far above normal. For example, in  Stavropol Kray a study of a drilling pipe warehouse indicated a  radiation level there of up to 200 microroentgens per hour. The  culprit was accumulation of radium salts inside the pipe.    In short, experts have long understood the significance of  this problem. Particularly since they had before them examples  of successful solutions to the problem in the West, where jobs  of this nature have been performed in compliance with national  and governmental programs since the mid-1970's. For example, in  1984 the United States allocated $13 million from the federal  budget and $600 million from state budgets for research in this  area.    Our program, which has been repeatedly discussed at every  level since 1987, both by the government and by parliament, was  clearly born under an unlucky star. Nothing seemed to help,  neither the five government directives signed by vice-prime  ministers nor support from the Supreme Ecological Council. But  the height of misfortune came with the two attempts to bring the  program up for discussion, first in the USSR Supreme Soviet and  then in the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet. The first attempt  was made in late August 1991, the second in October 1993. One  would have to believe that the Radon Program is truly jinxed.    It was only recently that a session of the government's  commission on the environment and natural resource use approved  the program, which will soon be submitted to the government for  confirmation. Bearing the past in mind, one should not jump to  any conclusions and predict a rosy future for the program. But  neither should it be said that it would be all that difficult to  implement. In any event, its cost -- R4.0 billion [rubles] in  1992 prices -- is two orders of magnitude lower than the error  made in calculating the Russian State Budget.    The first part of the Radon Program envisions selective  radon  safety studies of radiation levels in various regions of Russia  and identification of high-risk groups. The problem is that  radon levels in buildings are not constant. Therefore long-term  measurements must be taken in each building. It would take  thousands of years to study all the housing in Russia. Detailed  and comprehensive studies are planned only for regions where  radon presents a threat. According to preliminary estimates, 40  percent of populated areas could have dangerously high radon  levels.    A radiation-based, geological and chemical classification of  Russia's territory by degree of potential hazard from  naturally-occurring radionuclides will make it possible to  identify areas with varying degrees of hazard and choose  priority areas for accelerated environmental radiation studies.  The program's designers envision that by 1995 Russia will have a  map showing regions of increased radon hazard and will have  developed the formulas and technologies for the manufacture and  use of insulating building materials as well as a system of  radiation monitoring for use during construction, will have  taken steps to reduce radionuclide emissions by coal-burning  heat-and-electric-power stations and reduce irradiation of mine  workers, and will have obtained data on lung cancer rates among  the populations of areas with increased radon hazard levels  (according to UN data approximately 20 percent of all lung  cancer is caused by the effects of radon and products of its  decay).    This is precisely what places like Vyborg, Krasnokamensk and  Pyatigorsk need to end this quiet, invisible but equally  terrible natural Chernobyl.</p>

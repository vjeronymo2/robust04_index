			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] An official source in the Democratic Republic of  Yemen [DRY] has issued the following statement to the Yemeni  News Agency, Aden: The Sanaa regime has continued to play the  cease-fire declaration game by first stating the timing of a  cease-fire and then throwing its forces into a new act of  aggression by striking at residential quarters and vital  installations. It then claims the DRY is the one breaking the  cease-fire. Yesterday the (?collapsing) Sanaa regime said we  had broken the cease-fire.    For the fifth time they declared a cease-fire and then  ordered their forces to attack on all fronts, while sending  their aircraft and launching their shells and missiles against  peaceful residents and vital installations. They made several  such attacks this morning on the Aden refinery and its civilian  airport and mounted attacks and shelling on all fronts. Our  forces and people are heroically resisting and are exhibiting  legendary steadfastness. [passage omitted]</p>

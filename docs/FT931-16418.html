			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Turkey moves closer to EC on tariffs TURKEY has moved a step closer to full customs union with the European Community by announcing a substantial tariff preference for its European trade partners under a new import regime published this week. EC officials said the new two-tier tariff system, which took effect from January 1, provides both the Community and countries of the European Free Trade Association with real trade preference for the first time. The reform, which has taken three years to prepare, ends a number of non-tariff barriers and reduces effective protection rates for Turkish industry. The Community accounts for 43 per cent of Turkey's imports, worth around Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn) in 1991, and 50 per cent of the country's exports. Under customs union, by January 1996 Turkey is set to remove all trade barriers to EC goods and adopt the Community's common external tariff for third countries. In line with a 1963 Association Agreement with the Community, Ankara announced a further 10 per cent cut in the legal duty, on the so-called 10-year list and the more sensitive industrial items included in the 22-year list. The Turks have also gone some way to reduce non-tariff barriers to trade, which in practice kept Turkish levels of protection high and were a principal bone of contention in trade talks with Brussels in the past. Of these, special levies such as the municipality tax and stamp duty are scrapped. In a further concession, Turkey announced tariff cuts in agriculture and iron and steel products, which were not previously included in the negotiations. There remains some concern over the retention of the Mass Housing Fund, a non-tariff barrier which in some instances has been increased and even extended to products previously exempt, all in an apparent effort to make up for the revenue shortfall implicit in the changes.</p>

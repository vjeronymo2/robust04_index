			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> AIDES URGE BARRY AGAINST REELECTION BID;  </P> <P> DRUGS: FOLLOWING HIS COCAINE ARREST, THE MAYOR REPORTEDLY AGREES WITH HIS TOP  ADVISERS. BUT SOURCES SAY HE HAS NOT INDICATED ANY WILLINGNESS TO RESIGN.  </P> <P> Mayor Marion Barry, reeling from his arrest on a federal drug charge, has been  strongly urged by top political aides to abandon his reelection bid and has at  least tentatively accepted that suggestion, those advisers said Saturday.  </P> <P> One adviser said that Barry has been convinced of the futility of running for  reelection in a city plagued by drug abuse and drug-related homicides.  </P> <P> "He is resigned to it," said one adviser, who urged the mayor to scuttle his  reelection effort during a tense two-hour session Friday and in a strategy  meeting later. "It is a foregone conclusion, and the mood in there was like  that of an Irish wake."  </P> <P> The adviser said he was uncertain when Barry's decision would be made public.  </P> <P> Barry's reelection announcement, which had been scheduled for today, "was  postponed, obviously," the aide said.  </P> <P> "Maybe that postponement will just go and go and go indefinitely," the aide  said.  </P> <P> Barry, who was arraigned in federal court Friday on a misdemeanor cocaine  possession charge, has already turned over the running of his government to a  deputy.  </P> <P> The Barry adviser, who spoke only on the condition that he not be named, said  he is confident that the mayor will honor his pledge to drop plans for a fourth  four-year term in November.  </P> <P> However, Barry has frequently changed his mind on city issues without informing  his aides, particularly on budget matters, after first having agreed to accept  another course of action.  </P> <P> "If he is willing to go back on minor decisions involving the day-to-day  operations of the government, he could certainly do so here," said a longtime  associate of the mayor's. "But when he has time to reflect on this, he will  realize that there really is no way he can run again. The decision he  apparently reached Friday is one that eventually he will have to honor, even if  he tries first to go back on it."  </P> <P> Even if Barry does not run for reelection, he has not yet indicated any  willingness to resign, the sources said.  </P> <P> "We haven't talked about whether he will resign yet," said one adviser who  participated in Friday's meeting. "These things will all be dealt with, in  time, but the immediate concern was making a change for now."  </P> <P> Jeff Gildenhorn, a fund-raiser for the mayor who participated in Friday's  meeting, stopped short of saying Barry had agreed not to seek reelection.  </P> <P> "These are very trying times, and we want to direct the mayor in the right  direction," Gildenhorn said. "At this point, we have suggested that the mayor  re-evaluate his position, and . . . we want him to be thinking clearly and  lucidly."  </P> <P> Delano Lewis, president of the local Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. and  a longtime Barry associate, attended Friday's meeting but would not comment on  the mayor's reaction to the group's recommendations.  </P> <P> However, Lewis, who urged Barry to reconsider his plans for reelection just  days before the mayor was arrested, said he would issue another statement "on  local political matters" Monday. Lewis did not say whether his remarks would  address Barry's plans.  </P> <P> Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley said Barry would issue a statement today but  did not indicate if the subject would be his decision on whether to seek  reelection.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a Washington Post survey said that a majority of District of  Columbia residents polled Friday said Barry should resign immediately, while  three in four said the mayor should not run for a fourth term.  </P> <P> But nearly half of the 661 randomly selected district residents questioned also  said they believe that federal law enforcement officials were "out to get  Marion Barry any way they could."  </P> <P> WRC-TV, citing law enforcement sources, reported that the cocaine possession  charge Barry faces, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a  $1,000 fine, will not be dropped unless the mayor resigns.  </P></p>

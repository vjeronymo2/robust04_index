			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 2. The proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part A: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  The installation of the ATTS replaces older devices with devices of more modern design that perform the same function. No new control functions are added. No credible equipment failure modes or single failure are introduced which could result in the inability of redundant safety components or systems to perform their safety functions in accordance with the design basis accident analysis presented in Chapter 14 of the Browns Ferry FSAR. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part B:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The revision to the Units 1 and 3 reactor vessel water level safety limit and the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level setpoint do not reflect any change in plant equipment. The safety limit is being changed to reflect the actual analytical safety limit calculated by General Electric.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The change in the Level 1 low reactor vessel water level setpoint affects the timing of the operation of equipment necessary to mitigate the consequences of an accident. No new failure modes or system interactions are introduced. The same protection functions will still occur at the Level 1 low reactor water level setpoint. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part C:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The addition or correction of Unit 2 instrument identifiers is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of instrument identifiers does not require new system alignments, modifications, or changes in operating procedures. Therefore, no new external threats, system interactions, release pathways, equipment failure modes, or types of operator errors are created. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part D:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The change in Unit 2 reactor high water level and RCIC instrumentation functional test descriptions reflects the equipment currently installed and the functional tests currently being performed. The changes in calibration frequencies are being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. No new failure modes or system interactions are introduced. The same protection functions will still occur at the same setpoints. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part E:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The changes in Units 1, 2, and 3 calibration frequency for the differential pressure instrumentation, which actuates the pressure suppression chamber-reactor building vacuum breakers, is being made to reflect current setpoint calculations. The specified minimum number of instrument channels per trip system, function, trip level setting, actions required, remarks, functional test, and instrument check reflect current operational requirements. There are no modifications to plant equipment or changes in instrument setpoints associated with these changes. No new failure modes or system interactions are introduced. The same protection functions will still occur at the same setpoints. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part F:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed correction of the capitalization of terms in order to conform with the current TS Definitions section is administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling and capitalization of other words on the same pages is also administrative in nature and does not reflect any modification to plant equipment. The correction of spelling and capitalization does not require new system alignments, modifications, or changes in operating procedures. Therefore, no new external threats, system interactions, release pathways, equipment failure modes, or types of operator errors are created. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Part A:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The installation of the ATTS replaces older devices with devices of more modern design that perform the same function. The replacement equipment will improve reliability, accuracy and response times. There are no changes in the systems' design basis, protective function, or logic arrangement. Instrument setpoints and calibration frequencies are supported by Unit 3 specific calculations. Therefore, the proposed amendment does not involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

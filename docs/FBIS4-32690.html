			<p>BFN     [Text] The government has approved the final version of a  document entitled "The Fundamental Issues of Poland's Defense."  The text does not contain a clause on the superiority over  armed forces. The National Defense Committee [KOK] has excluded  this issue for separate examination. National Defense Minister  Piotr Kolodziejczyk, when presenting the guidelines of the  document on the fundamental issues of Poland's defense, said  that it would be possible to embark on modernizing the Polish  Army when the state budget expenditure on defense reaches the  level of 3 percent of the gross domestic product. At present,  the Ministry's budget stands at 2.1 percent of the state budget  expenditure.    Minister Kolodziejczyk believes that, if expenditure on the  Army is increased by 0.3 percent each year, the Polish Army will  achieve Western standards in 20 years.    [Begin Kolodziejczyk recording] The pace of technological  modernization within the armed forces will depend on the amount  of money guaranteed by the budget. We are pressing for 3  percent of the gross domestic product. Only then will we be  able to say that we are embarking on a gradual, slow, 20-year  process of modernizing the Army. The modernization should bring  our technological standards up to those of Western armies in  roughly the year 2015. [end recording]</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / N-plant granted 10-year extension BRITAIN'S oldest nuclear reactor, Bradwell, at Bradwell-on-Sea, Essex, is to continue running for another 10 years, Juliet Sychrava writes. Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, says the decision by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to allow the Magnox-type reactor an extended lease of life will put the lives of local people at risk. The group said that radioactive discharges from Bradwell were outside the new recommendations laid down by the Radiological Protection Board. Nuclear Electric, the state-owned operator of the nuclear stations in England and Wales, said it had satisfied the inspectorate that Bradwell presented no danger. It said it was well within the legal limits and added that it was looking at reductions in radioactivity. Bradwell, which generates 245MW a year, or enough power to supply Chelmsford, Colchester, and Southend, began generating electricity in July 1962.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Serbs allow UN convoy into Sarajevo SERBIAN irregulars yesterday finally allowed a United Nations convoy to enter the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo in a move which could lead to talks on the re-opening the airport and a resumption of food supplies to the starving inhabitants. The convoy left Belgrade, the Serbian capital, on Wednesday morning. But that night it was forced to take refuge in a barracks on the outskirts of the city after Serb forces prevented UN officials based in Sarajevo from escorting it into the centre. 'Now that it (the convoy) has arrived, we have to try to demilitarise the region around the airport which is held by Serb irregulars,' a senior UN official said yesterday. He added that it would be 'extremely difficult' to achieve this. UN officials said there was a lull in the fighting around most of the city. 'But it can flare up at any time. We just have to keep talking and keep negotiating so as to feed the starving people of Sarajevo,' a UN official said. The arrival of the convoy coincided with fighting in Mostar, the capital of Hercegovina, western Bosnia, where forces from Croatia yesterday forced out Serb irregulars. Zagreb and Belgrade radio reports confirmed that Croatian forces were consolidating their grip on this swathe of territory.</p>

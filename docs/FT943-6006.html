			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Value of farmland rises by 21% The average value of agricultural land rose 21 per cent in the year to the end of June, according to a farmland valuation index compiled by Savills, the land surveyors. The improvement in British farm incomes following the devaluation of sterling against other European currencies has contributed to the land boom, the company said. Land values increased most in regions where large arable holdings are predominant as these farmers have benefited most from the upturn. Rises in hill land value were lowest at 10 per cent.</p>

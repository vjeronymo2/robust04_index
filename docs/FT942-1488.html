			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Kinnock for EU Commissioner Mr Neil Kinnock, the former leader of the Labour party in the UK, yesterday confirmed at a meeting of socialist leaders in Corfu that he hopes to be appointed as Britain's second EU commissioner in Brussels from next January, writes Philip Stephens, Political Editor. His candidacy poses a dilemma for Mr John Major, the prime minister. Two years ago Mr Major bowed to pressure from right-wing MPs and rejected Mr Kinnock as the successor to Mr Bruce Millan. But a second refusal would prompt charges from the opposition that the prime minister remained in the thrall of a handful of Euro-sceptics.</p>

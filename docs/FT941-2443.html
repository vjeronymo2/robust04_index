			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Pitted against past failures: The outlook for companies mining collieries discarded by British Coal At 59, he had never worked for a private sector company and his job for 36 years, with British Coal, ended when he was sacked. But that has not stopped him making one of the most remarkable debuts on the London Stock Exchange in recent years. It is just six months since Mr Malcolm Edwards, former British Coal commercial director, took over as chairman of Geevor, a once renowned tin mining company. But since then shares in the company, renamed Coal Investments, have increased more than sevenfold in value to 76p. Although dealings in the shares have been suspended, pending a capital raising exercise, the company is likely to stand as a top performer of the past year when share transactions resume next week. The achievement is striking in a sector where fortunes are declining fast and, as a result of the government's controversial pit closures programme, publicly. Moreover the company plans to make its money, initially at least, from pits rejected as unprofitable by British Coal. It currently owns one pit, a tiny mine in Wales which was rejected as uneconomic by British Coal several years ago. The market's main interest in Coal Investments, however, lies in its plans to lease at least three of the corporation pits closed recently. Coal Investments is not the only company investors believe will thrive by mining British Coal's cast-offs. RJB Mining, a mainly opencast group, has seen the value of its shares increase by more than twice the London Stock exchange average to 400p since its flotation last June. Investors approve of its plans to lease up to four mines closed by British Coal, one of which, Clipstone in Nottinghamshire, it is already operating. Meanwhile at Betws in south Wales, a management buy-out team has attracted Pounds 2.5m of funds, mainly from Barclays Bank, to operate a mine closed by British Coal last year. Of 28 redundant pits closed and put out to tender for leasing and licensing in the past year at least six are being reopened under private licence, and bids are being considered for another four. But are Coal Investments, RJB, and Betws Anthracite heading for a fall? British Coal questions whether the market is big enough for all potential licensees to succeed. It also points out that the mines being reopened will turn out far less coal than they did under its stewardship - perhaps under half the amount. The licensees argue the planned scale and methods of their pit operations will, together with their marketing, ensure profitability. Mr Richard Budge, RJB chief executive, says British Coal 'has the culture of nearly 50 years as a nationalised industry - with all the problems that brings in bureaucracy and industrial relations. We are starting with a clean black board and we are writing the numbers.' One burden on the pits which the private operators are shaking off is the 'dead hand of the centre'. Mr Charles Kernot, analyst at stockbroker Credit Lyonnais Laing, explains: 'British Coal has always suffered because, as well as running pits, it has had to perform tasks like keeping up to date plans for the industry and supplying the government with facts and figures. The licensed pits will not have to bear the share of centralised costs that management did under British Coal.' The new operators expect bigger benefits to flow from different mining techniques at some pits, from a change in workplace culture, and from a focus on household and industrial markets which some believe British Coal neglected in its pursuit of the larger electricity generating market. Mining techniques vary considerably. Betws Anthracite's 90 miners will go back to the future by using explosives and their hands to hew the coal, rather than the 'long wall' cutting machinery operating in most British Coal mines. However, at RJB's Clipstone colliery, the only licensed pit reopened so far, there is no significant technological change. 'What will be different,' says Mr Budge, 'will be the attitude of the men and the amount of time they use the machinery.' In the brave new world of leasing and licensing the role of unions will be limited. Neither RJB nor Coal Investments will bargain collectively with unions, although employees will be free to join unions which may represent them in cases of individual grievance. Both companies want their workers to be shareholders. 'That will concentrate their minds on the business,' says Mr Edwards. A new flexibility is also being encouraged in the workforces. At Clipstone, electricians are being asked to cut coal when there is a lull in their usual tasks. Mr Alan Green, a British Coal employee for 14 years before being taken on by RJB, says: 'At RJB we get more involved with other departments and tasks than at British Coal. I prefer that.' Mr Green and other workers say their earnings are comparable to their British Coal days - Coal Investments and RJB decline to disclose rates  - but add they are prepared to work harder for it. Mr Budge predicts RJB's Clipstone will produce about 500,000 tonnes a year, half the tonnage under British Coal two years ago, but with a quarter of the men. This, of course, is a target yet to be achieved. Successful though RJB has been in the past it has made its name largely in opencast mining. This requires different skills and techniques from those needed for deep mines, although RJB says it has doubled productivity in three years since taking over two small deep pits in Cumbria. And, in the case of Coal Investments, Mr Edwards has made his name as a marketing man rather than as a mining engineer directly involved in cutting coal, although his company, like RJB, is employing former British Coal managers. Coal industry sceptics are concerned less with the ability of prospective licensees to cut costs than with the UK coal market. Initially, the licensees aim to displace imports of 1m tonnes-plus a year of coal for household consumption and 1.5m tonnes for general industry (excluding steel). British Coal believes the licensees can aim for a market of 2.5m to 3m tonnes a year, but warns they will have to compete with coal imported from countries such as Colombia, South Africa and the US, and extracted by the companies which will own British Coal's assets after privatisation this year and next. If British Coal's assumptions are right, perhaps five or six leased pits each producing about 500,000 tonnes a year, plus Betws producing 120,000 tonnes, could hope to remain in business. But even that might be optimistic. Mr Neil Clarke, British Coal chairman, spelt out the dangers when he said recently he expected some producers to be 'squeezed from the market'. Mr Edwards counters by saying pit closures this year will deprive the market of another 750,000 to 1m tonnes of domestic and industrial coal a year. That increases licensees' potential markets. Mr Budge also sees scope for displacing some of the 8m tonnes of coking coal bought abroad each year by British Steel. Moreover, he says British Coal's estimates also make little allowance for the possibility of cutting into the more than 3m tonnes of coal imported each year by the electricity generators. Arguments such as these have made a deep impression on investors in Coal Investments, RJB and Betws Anthracite. For all three companies, however, the hard work is ahead. They will prove their worth only if and when they extract their targeted tonnages of coal consistently and cheaply from deep mines, and then sell it profitably to the markets which they say are there for the taking.</p>

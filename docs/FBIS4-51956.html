			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- "The nuclear issue of the  Korean peninsula must be resolved by means of negotiation, not  by means of pressure", said the defence minister of Malaysia at  a press conference.    "Malaysia," he went on, "considers that the countries  concerned should show reason in settling the problem of the  Korean peninsula and not cause a war. If any party resorts to a  means of high pressure, a war would break out in that region and  it would affect the security of the Asia-Pacific region."    "Malaysia hopes the countries concerned sit at a negotiating  table and resolve this issue in a peaceful way and opposes any  country building up nuclear weapons or increasing nuclear  capacity," he said.</p>

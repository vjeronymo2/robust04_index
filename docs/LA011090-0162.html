			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> CAMPBELL SOUPS UP ITS PARTY  </P> <P> Robin Leach, host of "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous," was on hand as emcee  and there was a small crowd of well-known actors, singers and an Olympic  athlete, so what was the big event?  </P> <P> It was a celebration of Campbell Soup's 20-billionth can of tomato soup.  </P> <P> The company said the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul were perfect for  Tuesday's observance because the metropolitan area has one of the highest per  capita rates of tomato soup consumption in the nation.  </P> <P> Also attending the ceremony were Rita Moreno and Della Reese, both singers and  actresses and former Campbell spokeswomen; Jack Scalia, star of the "Wolf" TV  series and a former worker in Campbell's production plant in Sacramento; Marion  Ross, a former Minnesotan and mom on the old TV series "Happy Days;" and Jill  Trenary, a Minnesota native and Olympic figure skater.  </P> <P> The lunch of tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwiches was a far cry from  Leach's trademark line of "champagne wishes and caviar dreams."  </P> <P> But he shared a cooking tip for spiffing up canned tomato soup -- replace half  a soup can of water with red wine.  </P></p>

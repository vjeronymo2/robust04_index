			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Safe as the Bank of England the overnight military guard mounted at the Bank of England between 1780 and 1973 - will open at the Bank's museum on June 25. The Picquet was established in 1780 to protect the Bank from attack during the Gordon Riots. It continued until the Bank's own security force took over guarding the building in London's Threadneedle Street. One of the last Picquets to be mounted is shown far left. The cartoon, entitled 'A March to the Bank', was drawn by James Gillray in the 1700s.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Arts: Terrible tales of very silly mice - Tales of Beatrix Potter It is reasonable to assume that one does not see waltzing mice until delirium tremens has set in. The Royal Ballet proved otherwise on Friday night at the first stage performance of Tales of Beatrix Potter - though my suspicions are that only a company seriously in its cups would consider staging this bizarre entertainment. There were waltzing mice all over the place, and tittuping pigs, terminally winsome squirrels, a hedgehog laundress, and the entire and exhaustingly cute cast of Beatrix Potter characters whom Sir Frederick Ashton set jiggling in a film 21 years ago. That the film was a treat for youngest children is without doubt. Its small-scale dances, its rumty-tum music and pervasive quaintness, were a clever exercise in capitalising on a childhood classic. But that this thin stuff should be transferred to the stage; that an opera house should expend funds upon a ballet to attract a juvenile audience, when major works - Cinderella, The Nutcracker - can do this with choreographic and musical distinction; that sketchy little incidents about animals should be considered a proper use of a national ballet company, is beyond belief. The staging is misguided and unworthy of the Royal Ballet and of the reputation of its founding choreographic genius. During seventy interminable minutes we watch serious and gifted artists scuttling about, heavily masked, paws up, whiskers a-twitch, making tiny, tiny jokes, and burdened and extinguished by bloated outfits that are scrupulous copies of Beatrix Potter's drawings, while saccharin or vulgar tunes proclaim the dubious delights of Victorian musical taste. It is ballet conceived as the art of nostalgia - and psychologically very odd indeed. It is back-to-the-nursery as an aesthetic creed. It is entertainment for the tiniest tots that feeds off a brilliant original to make a calculated and commonplace show. It is, I am forced to conclude, a ploy by Covent Garden to bring in an audience on the tugging arms of children. It is an abrogation of the Royal Ballet's duty to show works of art. The set design by Christine Edzard is anaemic and looks amateurish: washed-out backcloths with elaborate properties that crowd the stage. The dancers are invisible, their performances lost under masks and the ballooning outlines of their costumes; only Matthew Hart makes something lively of Squirrel Nutkin. Of the narrative of the tales there is but the sketchiest evidence. Perhaps the most serious implication of this sorry affair is the existence of a body of Ashton work which should - to the advantage of audience and dancers - be restored to the repertory. Ashton, a master craftsman, made these dances for the camera and the special circumstances of the cinema. To show them on stage is to minimise their small but acutely judged effects and to minimise Ashton thereby. The sums expended on this apotheosis of the quaint and furry might have secured the revival of Ashton's Sylvia, whose enchanting and witty three acts, miraculous score and brilliant design, deserve to be rescued from oblivion. Tales of Beatrix Potter only merits the attentions of Rentokil. To complete this evening, the return of The Dream, not in the happiest of conditions. Originally the piece trod a skilful path over an abyss of Victorian prettiness and excessive Mendelssohnian charm. Characters had an edge: Titania was wilful, sexually intriguing; Oberon's androgynous air masked temper, passion; the lovers were sincere. The ballet is now saturated with roguishness. Neither Lesley Collier nor Bruce Sansom convinced me of the otherworldly allure of Titania and Oberon; the lovers played for laughs in a singularly leaden way. It was Tetsuya Kumakawa, giving the finest danced performance I have seen of the role, who makes Puck a truly magical being. His ability to turn and soar without apparent effort, his dazzling clarity of step, were marvellous. The rest was sentimentality - and fatal.

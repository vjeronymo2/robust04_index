			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> KITSCHY, KITSCHY GOO  </P> <P> With a crash, some flash and a chorus of "goos" and "aaaahs," "Kindergarten  Cop" (citywide), unveils the new kinder, gentler Arnold Schwarzenegger:  would-be super-hunk for the '90s.  </P> <P> But, even from this movie's new tot's-eye perspective, it's the same old Arnie  game. The Austrian inflections and minimalist acting strategies haven't  changed. Neither have the affable, bemused stares, the softly maniacal relish  at destroying bad guys.  </P> <P> There is something different: the context. Befitting the morning-after '90s,  Schwarzenegger is now a robo-cop with a heart, a tweetie-pie terminator, Dirty  Hansel with a pocketful of Gummi bears. He's Sudden Death elfinized: with  dozens of adorable kiddies dangling from every visible pectoral, gun-grip and  bicep.  </P> <P> As image makeover and sheer crass commercial calculation, "Kindergarten Cop" is  a dubious triumph. You have to give it credit: In a way, it's the ultimate  marketing-hook movie, a kind of pop-commercial bulldozer.  </P> <P> The director, Ivan Reitman, and the writers have streamlined their work with  such single-minded professionalism that their storytelling becomes the  cinematic equivalent of a foot in the door, a show that's all sell, hype  transmogrified. Watching the trailer probably made audiences want to see the  movie, and watching the movie may make them want to see the trailer. Actually,  I'm not sure which is the purer or more effective version of the story: maybe  it achieves its perfect aesthetic form in the 15-second TV spots.  </P> <P> "Cop" begins with what plays like a 20-minute parody of most of the  Schwarzenegger super-action specials of the '80s -- with the star's defiantly  slovenly and cheerfully sadistic undercover cop, John Kimble, stalking a drug  kingpin through a shopping mall, and pursuing a junkie witness to a Skid Row  dive, which he proceeds to blast apart with what looks like a sawed-off  howitzer.  </P> <P> Kimble, in his 12 o'clock shadow and great floppy overcoat, sometimes looks  like a flasher. His nemesis Crisp, by contrast, is a cold-blooded, nasty-natty  mama's boy with a ponytail (Richard Tyson), enraged because his ex-wife and boy  have disappeared. In order to trap him, Kimble and his female partner, Phoebe  (played by that husky-voiced, scene-stealing wonder, Pamela Reed) have to stake  out mother and child in Seattle. There, Phoebe will pretend to be the boy's  kindergarten teacher: a job that a series of contrived gastronomic and medical  mishaps promptly switches over to Kimble.  </P> <P> The movie's main under-theme is that the killer has what Kimble deserves: the  wife and child that are life's ultimate reward. Kimble, stoic dirty-job man,  has been fleeing domesticity; crazy Crisp wallows in it with his equally  sadistic mom (Carroll Baker). The movie becomes a race to see who ultimately  finds and wins the prize.  </P> <P> But, even more than this wisp of a fish-out-of-water hook, the film's strategy  lies in its gentling of Schwarzenegger. It's as if that first shot of slob  Kimble were a before-and-after set-up. "Cop" wants to turn him into someone who  belongs in a shopping mall. And it does: surrounding him with maternal or  sisterly substitutes throughout: most obviously food-freak Phoebe and Linda  Hunt as the school's taskmaster principal.  </P> <P> The filmmakers play Kimble's initial fascist tactics for laughs and then they  suggest (consciously?) that he's a better teacher, because he is a bit of a  fascist: because he takes this anarchic classroom and whips them into  drill-team shape, because he can beat up abusive parents.  </P> <P> Reitman uses the child actors well, but they're not as important as the title  and the trailers suggest, and some of their lines -- like the deadpan gags  about sexual organs -- are cheap and exploitative. In the end, nothing gets in  the way of this movie's self-salesmanship: mapped out and executed with  political campaign slickness. "Kindie-Cop" doesn't have plot twists; it has  testimonials and endorsements -- or, rather, it has plot twists that turn into  testimonials, that exist mainly to show what a swell guy Kimble-Schwarzenegger  is becoming.  </P> <P> It would be lying not to say that some of the moviemakers here, Reitman and his  editors especially, aren't working at the top of their craft, or that the movie  won't reach audiences. On its own terms, "Kindergarten Cop" (rated PG-13,  despite violence, sex and language) is nearly fool-proof: the last word in  glib, shallow, soulless, spuriously warm-hearted commercialism. In one scene,  it surpasses itself: Kimble's class, in matching Abraham Lincoln beards and  outfits, recites the Gettysburg address, Kimble gets a standing ovation, and  Reitman and company scrape the dizzy heights. They've taken us very near the  apotheosis of shameless kitsch.  </P> <P> 'Kindergarten Cop'  </P> <P> Arnold Schwarzenegger: Kimble  </P> <P> Penelope Ann Miller: Joyce  </P> <P> Pamela Reed: Phoebe  </P> <P> Linda Hunt: Miss Schlowski  </P> <P> Richard Tyson: Crisp  </P> <P> Carroll Baker: Eleanor Crisp  </P> <P> A Universal Studios release of an Imagine Entertainment presentation.

			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / Izetbegovic edges closer to Bosnian settlement: Progress may be made on split into mini-states BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic last night appeared to leave the door open to a settlement with his Serb and Croat adversaries which could end the 17-month conflict in Bosnia. After 12 hours of talks in Geneva, where peace talks resumed after 11 days, Mr Izetbegovic told reporters that progress could be made today on agreeing on a map to split the republic into three mini-states. But, in contrast to more upbeat statements from Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, he said: 'We have only discussed. No real progress so far. Maybe tomorrow.' Mr Karadzic had appeared earlier to step up pressure on Mr Izetbegovic to endorse a settlement today. He said: 'The negotiations are finished . . . we expect the Moslems to sign the whole package tomorrow.' While the two leaders appeared closer to an agreement, neither commented on whether they had agreed to make changes in the proposed map. UN officials played down the significance of an earlier announcement by Serb officials that Serbs and Moslems had reached a five-point deal which included a ceasefire and an early exchange of prisoners. Meanwhile, in another sign of gathering momentum in the peace process, western diplomats indicated that discussions were being stepped up for the possible deployment of peacekeeping troops in the area. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, is to meet Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in Geneva today to discuss issues including Bosnia. Nato officials in Brussels said the deployment of troops in Bosnia was likely to be the central topic, but warned that the allies were still not prepared to make any firm commitment yet on the numbers of troops. However, the Russian government yesterday pledged to provide extra peacekeeping troops for Bosnia in the event of a peace settlement between the three warring factions, the first major power to do so unconditionally. Speaking to reporters after meeting Mr Boutros Ghali, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, said the number of troops would depend on the terms of the peace accord and what their tasks would be. It is widely expected in Nato that the US will provide a large part of the 40,000-plus extra peacekeeping troops that international mediators say will be required to police a partition. British officials indicated that Britain was considering contributing several thousand troops, but stressed that a decision on the scale of its commitment could not be made until the three sides had reached a firm peace agreement in Geneva. Although the Bosnian Serbs have accepted the peace package it is unclear if they have made more territorial concessions to the mainly Moslem republic, which, under the plan, will form a union along with the Croat and Serb republics. But Mr Karadzic has previously refused to hand over more land to the Moslems. The Bosnian Moslems fear they will be wedged between the two ethnic states, at the mercy of their foes.</p>

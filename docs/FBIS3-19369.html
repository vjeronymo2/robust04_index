			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.K. Pretenderis: "Heirs-Apparent on the Scene"] </F>   [Text] [Minister of Interior] Akis Tsokhatzopoulos is  reportedly unhappy with [Minister of Environment] Kostas  Laliotis, whom many consider a possible candidate for secretary  general of the PASOK [Panhellenic Socialist Movement] party. A  number of press articles have been "pushing" [Minister of  National Economy] Yiorgos Yennimatas to the vice presidency of  the government, while [alternate Minister of Foreign Affairs]  Theodhoros Pangalos is suddenly concerned with the national  economy, as he revealed in news interviews. [Minister of  Industry] Kostas Simitis and [PASOK luminary] Vaso Papandreou  have "added their two bits" in public talks, while [former PASOK  Minister of National Economy] Dhimitris Tsovolas has attempted  the most specific attack yet against the government by (again)  speaking on the large economic interests which (supposedly)  direct governmental policy.    According to other information, [Minister of National  Defense] Yerasimos Arsenis is creating his own apparatus, a move  creating tension with the PASOK leadership. Simultaneously,  there are some who believe that Prime Minister Andreas  Papandreou's entourage is expressing dissatisfaction with the  defense minister. It should be noted that Papandreou is just an  observer in the "war of heirs-apparent" and does not take part  in it, limiting himself to periodically expressing concern  about, or approval of, one or the other ministers' actions.    Nevertheless, it is not coincidental that Laliotis has not  yet spoken up. Similarly, it is no coincidence that Simitis  delivered an essentially "programmatic speech" at the..... The  so-called modernizing wing of PASOK (from which Vaso Papandreou  should not be excluded) seems ready to "give battle" at the  PASOK congress on the basis of a "framework of principles  regarding a whole set of modifications" which, in the view of  many, government action lacks.    Tsovolas' tone is just as strong. He is considered by many  as  yet another candidate for the position of secretary general of  the central committee. It is the second time in a month and a  half that Tsovolas expresses politico-ideological criticism of  governmental policy, somehow accusing the government of  embracing, and speaking for, big economic interests. This is a  rhetoric that can prove decisive with the audience of the  congress, all the more so since there seems to be a  rapprochement between Tsovolas and Arsenis' apparatus.    Tsovolas' adversaries within PASOK attribute his sharp  criticism to his bitterness at not having been appointed  minister. It is said that this bitterness is aimed especially at  Yennimatas and Simitis (because, according to this version, they  refused to entrust Tsovolas with the ministry of economy or  commerce) and at Tsokhatzopoulos (for more obscure motives). Be  that as it may, the fact is that Tsovolas is developing a  rhetoric that may already enjoy support in the PASOK political  space or will acquire it on the way to the congress.</p>

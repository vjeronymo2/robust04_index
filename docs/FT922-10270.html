			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Letter: Lesson in innovation learnt in Hong Kong Sir, At the Institute of Directors' convention in London on Wednesday, Mr Peter Morgan, the director-general, exhorted Britain to become 'the Hong Kong of Europe'. For my consumer electronics group, this is more than an enterprise wish; it is an economic reality. Britain is, and will remain, the bedrock of Binatone's operation. Why, though, in a recession, have we forged ahead to become this country's number one in telephones, displacing BT as market leader? The answer is that we took a leaf from Hong Kong's book. For 25 years we have been learning from the Far East. Before the recession got a grip, I moved my base to Hong Kong, to be sure the group would continue to benefit from the stream of innovations endemic in Hong Kong culture. These enlightened attitudes have been promulgated throughout Binatone. It worked for us. I am convinced that anyone else - car manufacturers, service businesses - could do the same. With a new, strong governor for the colony, maybe more companies will reach out to it - and win. Gulu Lalvani, chairman, Binatone International, Binatone House, Beresford Avenue, Wembley, Middlesex HA0 1YX</p>

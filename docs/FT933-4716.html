			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / EC to push workplace deregulation EC MEMBER states are rallying behind the banner of labour market deregulation, including more flexible working hours and lower costs for employers, as the recipe for restoring growth and halting Europe's decline in compet-itiveness. A consensus in favour of change has emerged in working papers sent to the European Commission in Brussels, although member states remain wary of backing measures that might be interpreted as dismantling Europe's generous welfare state provisions. The competitiveness debate inside the EC has gathered pace amid growing concern about Europe's failure to create jobs and the rising level of unemployment. It has been given an added piquancy by a concerted effort from the UK government to woo German support for a post-Maastricht agenda for the EC. Mr David Heathcoat-Amory, British minister for European affairs, yesterday called for an end to 'dreaming about a single (European) currency' and more attention to the pressing issue of competitiveness. He also launched a fierce attack on the use of EC 'structural funds', which he suggested created 'a culture of dependency' among poorer states. In a speech to the European Policy Forum in London, the British minister's call for more scrutiny of the EC budget and less interference from Brussels appeared to be a calculated effort to play on latent German resentment at being the paymaster of Europe and its desire for more 'subsidiarity'. Mr Heathcoat-Amory said structural funds, which account for a third of the present Ecu67bn (Pounds 51bn) annual EC budget, had siphoned money to poorer regions in the Community; but they had also had a negative impact. They might have contributed to Portugal's rise in inflation and balance-of-payments difficulties in the 1980s, through increased imports. He added: 'Greece has yet to show corresponding macro-economic benefits in terms of GDP growth from structural funds; if anything, the gap between it and the Community is growing.' The minister's speech also attacked Mr Jacques Delors, who, as European Commission president, offered initial ideas on boosting European competitiveness to the EC summit last June. In spite of a good diagnosis, 'it prescribed medicines which were a mixture of the expensive, the unoriginal and the inadequate'. In his paper, Mr Delors favoured new spending on research and development, better training, a lifting of restrictions on private employment agencies and a more concerted effort to reach the economic convergence necessary for European monetary union. He is to develop those ideas in a December white paper.</p>

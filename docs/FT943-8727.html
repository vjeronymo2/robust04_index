			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Temps hired to tackle insolvency backlog The government's Insolvency Service was criticised by a trade union yesterday for hiring temporary staff from recruitment agencies in an effort to clear a backlog of outstanding regulatory work. The service has been bringing in extra staff to process thousands of reports from private-sector insolvency practitioners recommending the disqualification of directors of failed companies. The service, which is an executive agency of the Department of Trade and Industry under the government's Next Steps programme, has been allocated more than Pounds 1m for the next few months to reduce the backlog of reports but has avoided hiring full-time staff. It received only a limited response to its attempt to take on practitioners seconded from the private sector, and has now turned to two high street accountancy recruitment agencies to fill the vacancies. Mr Keith Ellis, chairman of the insolvency service branch of the Institute of Professional and Managerial Staffs, the civil-service union, said the policy would be expensive and raised fears about the quality of those hired. The attempt to boost the number of disqualifications came in response to publication last year of a highly critical report on the subject from the National Audit Office, the Whitehall watchdog. Mr Ellis said: 'If the government was serious about disqualifying directors it would ensure there were adequate staff to investigate cases fully in the longer term. This is knee-jerk reaction to the NAO report. They are hoping it will blow away.' It also emerged yesterday that the former deputy inspector-general of the service is considering setting up an advisory service for insolvency practitioners to help them prepare for visits from regulators. Mr Philip Pink, a certified accountant and insolvency practitioner, has sent a circular to individuals and firms offering to review their methods and compliance standards and to help prepare them for inspections. The Joint Insolvency Monitoring Unit has recently been set up as part of a new self-regulatory mechanism under pressure from the DTI to examine insolvency practitioners. The DTI is inspecting some practitioners directly. Mr Pink, who left the insolvency service five years ago, has recently been rehired on an 18-month secondment from Touche Ross.</p>

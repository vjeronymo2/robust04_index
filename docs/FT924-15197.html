			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: With a bound we were free Sir, Free to do what? All those who are rejoicing at our new-found 'freedom' to set our own economic policies appear to suffer from a serious loss of memory. Some among them may, like me, be old enough to have travelled on the continent in the late 1950s. They may remember how prosperous this country seemed compared with France, Germany or northern Italy. Today it is Britain which is the poor neighbour, in spite of the huge windfall of North Sea oil. The social services are incomparably better in most members of the EC than they are here; in the core group, the roads are better as are the railways; industry is much more productive. Between 1960 (a reasonable starting point since by then the physical damage suffered during the second world war had been largely repaired) and 1990 - that is before we entered the ERM - the pound lost nearly 90 per cent of its internal purchasing value. We were free then. Will we use our new freedom to repeat our economic performance during the last 30 years over the coming 30? M H Fisher, 16 Somerset Square, Addison Road, London W14 8EE</p>

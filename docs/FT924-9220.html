			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / UK Company News: High-Point tumbles Pounds 3.2m into the red EXCEPTIONALS, including restructuring and redundancy costs, pushed High-Point, the international construction consultancy and management group, into pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.18m for the year to May 31. Profits in the previous year amounted to Pounds 1.74m. The share price tumbled from 150p to 98p. Mr Ian Reeves, chairman, had warned at the interim stage, when the company slipped into losses of Pounds 64,000, of the deterioration in the general business climate. He said yesterday that conditions had worsened in the second half. Accordingly, the company had undertaken a review of project work in progress and debtors in circumstances where clients had suspended or delayed further works or shown signs of liquidity problems. Also included in the review were clients in countries where political and economic changes meant the company was unable to secure prompt payment. Substantial provisions had accordingly been taken and were included in the Pounds 1.92m exceptional charge. Turnover declined to Pounds 55.6m (Pounds 58.7m) and operating profits fell from Pounds 4.28m to Pounds 1.04m. Interest charges were reduced from Pounds 2.54m to Pounds 2.33m and Mr Reeve reiterated the company's plan to sell certain businesses in order to reduce debt and reposition the group. Looking ahead, he expected conditions in the current year to remain difficult and said the group would continue to overhaul structure and costs. Although rationalisation costs continued to affect the current half he expected improved operating profits for the year. Losses per share came through at 53.5p (earnings 24.4p). The final dividend is omitted (4.95p) leaving the total at 1.3p (7.5p). Rationalisation costs were affecting the current half but improved operating profits were expected for the year</p>

			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Capital spending cuts Vaux to Pounds 31m VAUX GROUP, Sunderland-based regional brewer and hotels and nursing homes operator, held its final dividend at 6.1p in spite of a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 34.3m to Pounds 30.9m. Results for the 53 weeks to October 3 were depressed by a Pounds 4.65m increase in interest charges after heavy capital spending on hotels and pubs. Spending amounted to Pounds 75m - Pounds 35m on the acquisition of 270 pubs, Pounds 15m on the completion of new hotels at Bristol and Bexley, Pounds 17m on refurbishment and Pounds 8m on the breweries. During the year the group raised Pounds 20m from the sale of the Blayneys off-licence chain, Pounds 20m from the issue of debenture stock and Pounds 10m from a hotel sale and leaseback. Trading profits rose 10.9 per cent to Pounds 39.5m (Pounds 35.6m) on turnover 7.5 per cent lower at Pounds 247m (Pounds 267m). Earnings per share declined 6.3 per cent from 20.31p to 19.04p. The total distribution of 9.35p compares with 9.2p last year. Acquisitions contributed to a 27 per cent increase in profits from Vaux and Wards breweries and the tenanted pub estate to Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 15.3m). Turnover improved by Pounds 10m to Pounds 98.3m. The group has bought 448 pubs since 1989 and has 'substantially strengthened' its regional position in the north of England, said Mr Paul Nicholson, chairman. Vaux Inns, taking in the group's 127 managed houses, achieved a 2 per cent growth in profits, from Pounds 4.65m to Pounds 4.74m, on turnover ahead 10.6 per cent at Pounds 36.6m. Volume sales through the group's own pubs rose 10.5 per cent - but would have declined 5 per cent if thenew pubs were excluded. Free trade volumes were slightly higher. Profits from St Andrews nursing homes rose 26 per cent from Pounds 3.24m to Pounds 4.09m and five new homes are planned during the next 18 months. The recession remained a drag on hotel profits which increased less than 1 per cent to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 12.4m) on turnover up 10.7 per cent to Pounds 77.9m. Borrowings increased from Pounds 101m to Pounds 122m and gearing increased from 20.8 per cent to 32.4 per cent. COMMENT Vaux was a bit unlucky to choose 1987 to launch a five-year plan for its hotels development. It has spent Pounds 178m - and ended in a recession with its properties devalued by a third and half the profits it forecast. The last two hotels to be completed, at Bristol and Bexley, cost Pounds 58m and contributed Pounds 600,000 in operating profits last year. Having taken another Pounds 1m costs out of the operations, there is not much else to be done except pray for a speedy end to the recession. A deal of consolation, in the meantime, is provided by the rapid payback from strengthening the pub estate with acquisitions in northern England and by the improving prospects for the group's nursing homes. Analysts forecast profits of between Pounds 26m and Pounds 27m clean of property next year, and on a prospective p/e of 13.5 times rate the stock undervalued on the group's recovery potential.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yiannis Yiannikos, president of PRAVDA </F> International joint stock company: "We Respect PRAVDA's  Traditions"]    [Excerpts] Recently there has been a lot of talk and many  rumors surrounding PRAVDA and our company. So I cannot keep  quiet and want to share with readers my view of what has  happened.    We came to PRAVDA as friends. We came about two years ago  when complete closure threatened the newspaper because of  financial difficulties. Our company helped the editorial office  to settle its debts, and as a result of our cooperation PRAVDA  began to be published regularly, five times a week again instead  of three. [passage omitted]    We have always respect, continue to respect, and will  respect  PRAVDA's traditions. Therefore we did not interfere before in  either the creative process or the political line of the  newspaper and we shall not do so in the future. Incidentally,  the stories in some publications that someone was dismissed by  the joint stock company directors' council for his political  convictions is blatant slander. The company does not engage in  such matters at all. The terms of our cooperation are enshrined  in the contract: democracy and pluralism. We realize that we  are dealing with an opposition newspaper but a genuine  opposition is always creative because it does not destroy the  country but helps the people to resolve their important problems.    But when the newspaper's new chief editor was elected in  October the atmosphere at the PRAVDA International joint stock  company changed drastically. For us it was a complete surprise:  V. Linnik had been on the joint stock company directors'  council for nearly two years and in contrast to G. Seleznev and  A. Ilin he invariably supported any proposal of ours. Having  become chief editor he and some of his supporters steered a  course toward destroying the joint stock company, ruining the  cooperation to which they had previously been loyal, and  reneguing on agreements and commitments, including those backed  by V. Linnik's signature (and I respect people who do not betray  the promise they have made). For that they even agreed to stop  PRAVDA's production. A campaign of lies and slander began.    Our relations of cooperation with the most esteemed Russian  newspaper are now being restored. On 4 February this year a  meeting of the editorial collective confirmed that the newspaper  will be published within the framework of the PRAVDA  International joint stock company. It will be published  regularly and reach all subscribers, wherever they may live. It  has already been decided to ensure stable and permanent  financing for PRAVDA's printing. I hope that in the very near  future the newspaper's staffers will have no complaints about  their wages either. The statements issued in recent weeks that  the Russian PRAVDA International company is bankrupts and has no  money are completely untrue. Incidentally, we are now having to  pay V. Linnik's debts too.    There is a great deal of speculation on the subject of  whether PRAVDA has become a Greek newspaper. I have been  investing money in it for about two years but never for a single  day has it ceased to be a Russian publication concerned for the  destiny of its own country?! And the permanent staff of PRAVDA  International include about 200 Russian citizens and just one  Greek -- the financial director of the joint stock company. It  is clear that he cannot deal with the newspaper's creative  business. His main concern is normal financing for PRAVDA.    I am reproached for refusing any contacts with Russian  businessman and not wanting their cooperation in the company  which we have created in conjunction with PRAVDA. That is  utterly untrue. With the approval of the majority of PRAVDA  employees substantial business contracts are now being concluded  with major Russian entrepreneurs. Their aim is to elaborate  long-term programs of cooperation for the benefit of PRAVDA,  PRAVDA employees, and readers. I think they will end  successfully.    I realize that my PRAVDA friends are working in complex  conditions and that it is hard for PRAVDA readers to live. I  respect those who make the newspaper and those at whom it is  aimed. I want to help our common cause of peace, the friendship  of the peoples, and the attainment of people's prosperity.</p>

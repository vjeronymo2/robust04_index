This calls for a  pause to examine what the United States is planning to do at the  present stage. The report directly quotes the defense secretary  himself, a proponent of creating the proposed divisions, saying  that these will consist of highly trained, powerful, and fully  equipped forces.    The usual excuse the American people are given as a  justification for the creation of such forces is to support the  "legitimate" U.S. stand. But the truth is completely the  opposite. The truth is that the U.S. stand worldwide, beginning  with Vietnam and Iraq and ending with Somalia, is so far  motivated by the U.S. past defeats in battles against the  peoples of these countries. Meanwhile the type of these defeats  should not be forgotten. [sentence as published]    The U.S. defeat in Vietnam seems somewhat different, both in  essence and in form, from the failure of the U.S. aggressive  plan against Iraq. Now that Washington seems to be embroiled in  another defeat in Somalia, it means that Washington is plagued  by defeats in every place, location, and time. The arsenals of  faith by which the people arm themselves will always remain  stronger than the arsenals of destructive weapons by which  American aggressors arm themselves.    Undoubtedly this is certain and stands no argument. It is  also certain that the United States wants to create this type of  military force in order to make up for the failure of the Rapid  Deployment Force [RDF] it established shortly after the Vietnam  war with the aim of imposing its hegemony on the world. Indeed  its aim is also to wash the dirty American face of some of the  mud of defeat and of the shame of failures of NATO plans against  Iraq under the U.S. leadership.    It is also certain that the tasks of the new forces of  aggression will be directed against the Third World countries  but will not go beyond to tension areas in Europe. Therefore it  is unlikely that the American forces will intervene in order to  stop the unjust aggression against the people of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, for example. What Western commentators said  regarding the objective behind establishment of the new  aggressive forces is that it is to boost the American people's  morale, end the embarrassment in which the U.S. forces found  themselves in Somalia, and reassure the American people that the  U.S. will not get involved in major conflicts. In fact, this is  not all that lies behind creating the new aggressive forces.  What lies behind it is something bigger and more serious, namely  the greedy and covetous way the United States insists on  imposing hegemony on the world. This is confirmed by the fact  that Washington has categorically rejected the idea of  establishing a joint European Corps, because it insists that  there should be no other force sharing U.S. hegemony of the  world. On the other hand, events have confirmed the implicit  criticism by UN Secretary General Butrus Ghali--despite his  well-known record and his accusing the United States of playing  the role of world policeman. [sentence as published]    A quick glance at the tasks of the new U.S. aggression  forces  would readily show that their objective is not to support the  "legitimate" U.S. stand, but rather to strengthen the role of  the U.S. policeman on the international level so that the U.S.  force will remain the world's number one force following the  collapse of the cold war, as the U.S. defense secretary said.</p>

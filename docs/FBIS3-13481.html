Bowing to world pressure, India pledged to  open up the Kashmir valley to diplomats of Islamic countries, so  vehemently refused in the past, and requested the UNHRC to  appeal to Pakistan not to press the resolution. In the  meantime, the Iranian permanent envoy in the UNHRC declared that  his country would continue to exert pressure on India to  alleviate the sufferings of the people of held Kashmir and  improve the human rights situation there. On his appeal,  supported by 15 other countries including China, Pakistan agreed  to defer voting on its resolution for one year.    Following tabling of the resolution at Geneva by Pakistan  for  censuring India for its violations of human rights in Kashmir  the scenario kept hanging as the days progressed. There were  two postponements on the vote on Pakistan's resolution and it  became obvious that many of the 53 members of the UNHRC would  abstain during the vote. That would not have been desirable.  By deferring the vote on its resolution Pakistan has thereby  gained time to persuade the abstaining countries to review their  decision. The Latin American countries, in particular, had  indicated that they wanted a little more time to fully grasp the  various aspects of the Kashmir problem. On the urging of  friendly countries Pakistan did not press for a vote, but  nevertheless it has accomplished what it set out to do. By  tabling the resolution at UNHRC and actively lobbying for it  Pakistan has fully succeeded in highlighting the Kashmir dispute  and focusing attention of the international community on the  miserable human right situation prevailing in Indian occupied  Kashmir. It is because of the intense diplomatic pressure  Pakistan put on India that Delhi recently arranged visits by two  batches of foreign diplomats to Kashmir and announced permission  for a team of International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) to  visit it. Also notable is the fact that since the beginning of  the current session of UNHRC at which Pakistan tabled its  resolution, there has been a drastic reduction in the killings  in occupied Kashmir. As Foreign Minister Sardar Asif Ahmed Ali  put it, the said resolution is very much alive and can be put up  at other forums. Thus while on the one hand Pakistan has  succeeded in putting India on the defensive on the human right  issue in held Kashmir, on the other, it retains the diplomatic  initiative in the matter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Havana, 6 Mar (PL) -- The Cuban weekly JUVENTUD  REBELDE today urged the U.S. Government to earmark funds for the  protection of individuals who are fleeing repression in Haiti  instead of financing the invention of politically persecuted  people in Cuba.    JUVENTUD REBELDE expressed its views on the subject when  commenting on the 3 March disclosure of a secret official U.S.  report recognizing the nonexistence of solid cases of human  rights violations in Cuba.    The document, signed by Joseph Sullivan, chief of the U.S.  Interests Section in Havana, was prominently published by  JUVENTUD REBELDE under the title, Top Secret (Muy Secreto).  [title given in English followed by editorial note in Spanish].    The U.S. report, the weekly publication notes, "is  irrefutable evidence not only of the lies and hoaxes invented  and promoted against the Cuban revolution, but also -- even  though it comes form our enemies -- of the absolute probity that  has always characterized us."    Although we did everything possible to work with human  rights  groups to obtain more solid cases, most of the interviews did  not produce any conclusive cases, the official U.S. document  states.    For the past 35 years Cuba has reiterated that there have  been no cases of murder, torture, or missing persons in our  country, and no one can deny that, JUVENTUD REBELDE contends.    It also protests the fact that based on fabrications of this  nature and statements by small groups that have made a business  out of the alleged defense of human rights in Cuba, the United  States is trying to condemn Cuba at the UN Human Rights  Commission for violating those rights.    How do the governments that support Washington's position at  the United Nations feel now that U.S. officials themselves have  admitted in secret reports the falsity of their arguments, the  Cuban weekly asks.    JUVENTUD REBELDE also stresses the fact that the document  also recognizes the fraudulent nature of many actions carried  out by groups that claim to defend human rights here, whose  leaders "make money at the expense of a program for refugees  that has no justification."    During the past few months, there have been frequent reports  of fraudulent requests from activists and paid testimonies by  human rights leaders, the U.S. document admitted in reference to  the procedures followed to request asylum in the United States.

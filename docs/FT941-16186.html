			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / International Company News: Deinhard sells brand Tropicana Products, Seagram's fruit juice business, has acquired Hitchcock, Germany's leading premium fruit juice brand, from Deinhard, the family-owned wine company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Mr Manfred Scherer, Deinhard executive vice-president, said yesterday that the sale was a logical consequence of the company's long-term strategy of focusing on its core wine business. However, Deinhard will continue to distribute the brand in Germany. Mr Myron Roeder, Tropicana's president, said that Hitchcock, a pure fruit juice, was 'a perfect match for our own portfolio of premium juices' and was an important step towards building a significant and profitable business. Germany's annual consumption of fruit juice, at almost 40 litres a head, is the highest in the world but more than 97 per cent of available products are made from concentrate.</p>

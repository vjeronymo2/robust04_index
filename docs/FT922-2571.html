			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / BCCI creditors plan appeal CREDITORS of the English operations of Bank of Credit and Commerce International have decided to appeal against the High Court judgment which last week sanctioned the Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 936m) compensation package negotiated by Touche Ross, the bank's liquidator, with the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders. Touche Ross said an appeal would not affect its attempts to have the plan approved in Grand Cayman and Luxembourg, two other jurisdictions in which BCCI was based.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- Business sentiment among  small and medium-sized firms is improving, a survey by the Japan  Finance Corporation for Small Business showed Friday [6 May].    According to the survey taken in the January-March period,  the diffusion index (di) for the economy stood at minus 28.2,  improving 9.0 percentage points from the previous three months  and contracting for the second quarter in a row. The figure  represents the number of companies saying the economy is  worsening subtracted from those saying it is picking up.    A corporation official said the minus figure is still large,  adding, "we need to wait and watch a little more before saying  the trend has changed" from the recessionary stage.    The di for sales and profit improved for the second term in  a  row, but the di for the number of employees remained weak.    The survey was conducted on 13,000 small and medium-sized  companies at the end of March, with 45.7 percent responding.</p>

			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / The essence of leadership President George Bush was at his best during the Gulf war. For a few heady months the prospect of a Pax Americana in the Middle East shimmered before our eyes. Now, as the Earth Summit begins in Rio de Janeiro, the US president is at his worst. He is the elected head of the most powerful nation. His natural role is to lead us. He alone might have been able to make a success of Rio. Instead, he has striven to wreck it. What the planet is getting is not US leadership, but a Pox Americana. This is not to say that Washington should have signed the lengthy draft treaties on global warming and biodiversity without demur. There was, and still is, plenty to argue about. But the head of the single remaining superpower should have taken the initiative. He was right to brush aside absurd Third World demands, but he should have replaced them with reasoned proposals of his own. A positive treaty curtailing emissions of greenhouse gases, and another protecting threatened species, could have been shaped to fit US thinking. Both could have been kept within manageable bounds by going ahead full steam where the science is clear (on the ozone layer, for example) and sticking to the precautionary principle where there is imprecision (the greenhouse effect). Action could have been confined to the use of market mechanisms, tradable permits, globally-negotiated tax strategies, tied aid, and, where prohibition is the only answer, universal agreements. Many polluting industries would prefer the certainties of regulation to life in a market governed by green consumer pressures. They could have had it. Mr Bush could have pulled off such an historic deal, had he used his single most outstanding skill: working the telephone. What he has instead bulldozed out of the rest of us is a toothless draft on the global threat and, on preserving plants and animals, a neutered document that the US will now not sign because the president fears the effect on his domestic biochemical industries. I say this as an unashamed admirer of the US. We Europeans would not be enjoying the blessings of a free society if it had not been for the sacrifices of life and treasure made on our behalf by Americans. It is what their current administration is doing to our grandchildren that bothers me. In his foreign policy, Mr Bush represents the finest in the post-1945 American tradition. He is of the old school - Atlanticist, outward-looking, a skilled diplomat. In his domestic and environmental policies, he looks like a cheap politician, a buccaneering oilman, a prisoner of the new Right. The man who promised to be 'the education president' and build a 'gentler America' has presided, bewildered, over the rioting in Los Angeles; the candidate who said he would be the 'environmental president' speaks today like an enemy of the earth. One reason is that the intellectual pendulum has swung against action by governments. I was reminded of this by the text of a recent address to the class of 1992 at Fordham university in the Bronx. The speaker, Dr John Brademas, is, like Mr Bush, an American of the old school. There the resemblance ends. Dr Brademas, who is president emeritus of New York University, was a Democratic congressman from Indiana for 22 years and majority whip under president Carter. He worked with the liberal Adlai Stevenson and, as member of a congressional committee, helped draft many of President Lyndon Johnson's bills establishing the 'Great Society'. In short, he represents everything that today's conventional wisdom says went wrong in the 1960s and 1970s. He was swept out of Congress in the 1980 Reagan landslide. So why listen to him? Because he has a point. 'The essence of leadership in a democratic society,' he explained to the Fordham freshers, 'is to persuade the electorate to do that which they might not as individuals want to do but know in their hearts they should do for the greater good'. Such an approach can lose elections, but nobody is seriously advocating that it is always good campaigning strategy. In office, it is an essential principle. This is particularly true in the US, whose constitution prevents any one individual, or body, from exercising dominant control. 'Often, a president's major challenge is shaping a consensus . . . inside his own administration before taking that policy to congress and the people,' said Dr Brademas. It is not only big-government big-spenders who need to do this; conservatives too fare best, and serve most beneficially, when they seek to lead in a positive direction. Mr Bush, like his predecessor, has been hampered by a Democratic Congress, but that is no reason to abdicate the role of leader. President Ronald Reagan did not do so - and, for all his shortcomings, he has lived to see the crumbling of the 'evil empire'. President Bush or his successor must now strive to ensure that liberal democracy has not triumphed merely to inherit a desert.</p>

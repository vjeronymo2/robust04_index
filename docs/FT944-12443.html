			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Survey of Australia (5): A long haul to greater efficiency - Shaking up the big state monopolies remains an urgent priority ONE of the greatest pieces of infrastructure redevelopment in Australia is arguably the conversion of rail freight lines connecting the mainland capital cities into a single, standard-gauge network. By the middle of 1995, and for the first time in the country's history, goods being transported from one state to another will no longer be delayed by differences in rail track widths. Until 1982, a journey from Brisbane on the east coast, to Perth, on the west, involved five changes of gauge, shifting from narrow to standard to broad and back to narrow. To move goods across, bogie exchanges were installed to change bogies underneath the waggon and enable the transfer of containers. Over recent years, standard tracks have gradually been installed across borders so that today the Melbourne to Adelaide corridor is the only missing link in a standardised national system. This is now being rectified, with the construction expected to be finished by May 1995. The system's inefficiency has long bedevilled Australian business, which has borne the cost and consequence on its competitiveness. The Bureau of Industry Economics, which has examined the performance of Australia's infrastructure against world competitors, says that Australian rail freight charges are at least twice as high as its cheapest competitor. Its productivity was only 27 per cent of the world's best performer in 1991-92. The state of the nation's railway system reflects how practices and institutions established by individual colonies in the 19th century have continued beyond the federation, thus presenting a major obstacle to a single, national and competitive economy. It is no wonder, then, that the ruling Labor government has made state enterprises the target of the latest phases of its macro-economic reform. During the last 10 years, the federal government's reform programme has seen the deregulation of the financial and labour markets. Today, reform is aimed at state corporations and authorities, which have almost total control over infrastructure facilities. Earlier this year, the Commonwealth government adopted an internally-generated report on national competition policy, the so-called Hilmer Report, which recommends that state government enterprises be opened to free competition. Also being freed-up are statutory marketing bodies and unincorporated enterprises, such as the professions, particularly the legal sector. These three areas have until now been immune to the Trade Practices Act. Infrastructure costs are over 10 per cent of the input of all of Australia's industries. The Bureau of Industry Economics study has found that in terms of price, reliability and efficiency, Australian infrastructure was below world best practice, in some cases substantially so. The government estimates that reforms in state-run utilities would increase national output by ADollars 8bn (USDollars 5.5bn) a year. Although the state governments have generally agreed to implement the Hilmer Report, it is nevertheless an arduous task for the Commonwealth government. It is dealing with eight states and territories, all fiefdoms with different politics, different views of competition, and where business enterprises have different structures and are covered by different laws. The first hurdle has already appeared. This is the issue of compensation for the states who stand to lose 'monopoly rents' provided by the enterprises. When these are privatised, the income will flow directly to the Commonwealth government as company tax. At a meeting in August between the Commonwealth and state governments, the heads of states and the prime minister, Mr Paul Keating, were deadlocked on the level of compensation. Understandably, the states wanted to get more, whereas the Commonwealth wanted give less. A Commonwealth bureaucrat said that some states justified their high demands by pointing at the steeply-rising revenues from state enterprises. He said it was unclear how much of the increases were due to excessive charges or to the increasing proportion of profits paid to states as dividends. The issue was resolved with the states asking the Industry Commission to examine the yearly increase in Commonwealth revenues as a result of the reform. A commonly-agreed formula will then be set for splitting revenues. The states have widely differing approaches to implementing the programme. Victoria has been implementing an aggressive privatisation team since the Liberal government took power three years ago. Mr Alan Stockdale, the Victorian treasurer, showed a hint of concern that privatisation already accomplished may be excluded from the revenue-sharing. 'The Industry Commission is working with a brief from the state treasurers and it will clearly consider all relevant issues, including retroactive compensation,' he said. Queensland, meanwhile, resists the sale of public assets, claiming that, unlike Victoria, it does not carry a debt burden and therefore does not need to have a fire sale. However, it has in recent years introduced a 'corporate culture' in state enterprises, which has resulted in some efficiency gains. Western Australia alone has refused to surrender its utilities to a national competition law. But Mr Stockdale said the different approaches are a natural part of the co-operative process. 'There are some differences but I believe everyone is genuine about their commitment to national competition,' he said. Mr Stockdale, who is recognised as the architect of the Victorian privatisation programme, considers the electricity industry as deserving the top priority for de-regulation. He said Victoria has slipped from the lowest cost electricity supplier in the 1960s to the most expensive on the eastern seaboard. He would like to turn that round to regain competitive advantage. The first sale, that of a power generator, is due next year. The government expects that before 1996 there will be free competition for generation and distribution in the state. The core transmission grid will remain a state monopoly.</p>

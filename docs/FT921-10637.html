			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rates rise TIGHTER conditions returned to the UK money markets yesterday, forcing overnight rates as high as 12.5 per cent at one stage. 'There's not much to invest in at the short end of the market,' said one senior dealer. The overnight rate drifted back down by the end of the day to finish at 10 3/4-5/8. One-month and two-month interbank rates were unchanged at 10 11/16-5/8, while the key three-month rate was a touch lower at 10 11/16-9/16. March short sterling fell to 89.59, from Monday's close of 89.63. The Bank of England initially forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.05bn, which was twice revised to finish as high as Pounds 1.25bn. The main drain on liquidity was exchequer transactions which took Pounds 560m out of the market. Treasury bills and maturing assistance drained a further Pounds 538m and bankers' balances below target called for Pounds 65m. The decline in note circulation added back Pounds 100m. In an early round of assistance, the Bank offered a bills totalling Pounds 201m, for resale to the market on February 21 at a rate of 10 7/16 per cent. Further operations saw another repurchase for the same date totalling Pounds 101m, also at 10 7/16 per cent. The bank stepped in during the afternoon with an injection of Pounds 395m, through the purchase of Band One and Band Two bank bills at 10 3/8 per cent. Late assistance provided Pounds 345m. The German money market was also tight yesterday in advance of the Bundesbank's expected repurchase today. The central bank may increase the one-month repo rate to lodge a protest against this week's 6.4 per cent pay settlement with German steel workers. Recent one month repos have been about 9.4 per cent. German overnight rates were little changed on Monday, trading at 9.65/70 per cent. Economists in the UK said that the German wage settlement dampened hopes for a rate cut in the UK. However, a rate cut was not seen to be as politically crucial as it had been, following the reduction in mortgage rates. 'Politically it would not gain them that much,' said Dr Mark Austin, an economist with the HongKong Bank, 'and it contains the risk that sterling might fall.' In the US, federal funds traded at 3 7/8 per cent during the day, compared with 4 per cent on Monday.</p>

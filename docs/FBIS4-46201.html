			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been learned that the military columns under  the command of the Western Military Command and members of the  Border Supervisory Units and local People's Police Force, and  local residents are blocking the routes, crushing, and enjoying  the victory over the members of the RSO [Rohingya Solidarity  Organization] or Kalarzo terrorist organization, who cannot  stand to see the all-round development programs being carried  out for the country to become a peaceful, modern, and developed  state. The members of the RSO, who are based on the other side  of the country [near Bangladesh], entered into the Maungdaw area  in Rakhine State in the last week of April to engage in  destructive bombing activities to cause instability in the  region.    Members of the RSO or Kalarzo terrorist group organized the  youths who absconded from Myanmar to Bangladesh in 1991 by  persuading and rewarding them. The group also provided the  basic military training course to the youths.    The RSO or Kalarzo terrorists entered Maungdaw Township from  the sea by schooners in the last week of April 1994. At  midnight on 28 April 1994, nine out of 12 time bombs planted in  12 different places in Maungdaw Township by these Kalarzo  terrorists exploded at different times. One fire engine and  some buildings were damaged, while four civilians were seriously  wounded in the explosions. The remaining three unexploded time  bombs were confiscated by the authorities. On the same night, a  RSO or Kalarzo terrorist group comprising about 80 members  entered Maungdaw, (Taunggyan), Minlut, Kyaukpandu regions in  Mayu Taunggyaw, while another group comprising about 40 members  entered northern part of Maungdaw, Bandoola, Aungthabye,  (Minkanaung) regions in Mayu Taungdan.    The Kalarzo terrorists who entered the southern part of  Maungdaw burned down the houses in Kyaukpandu Village at 0200 on  1 May. Ten civilian houses were destroyed in the fire. The  same group attacked the new ideal Zeyawaddy Village with small  arms and burned down the houses at 0300 on 2 May. Two houses  belonged to the village workers and 14 civilian houses were  destroyed, while one civilian was killed and a 17-year-old girl  was injured in the incident.    The Kalarzo terrorists who entered the northern part of  Maungdaw burned down 13 houses in Shwetaung Village at 1030 on  10 May. On 15 May, two civilians from Aungthabye Village were  also injured when they stepped on a mine planted by these  terrorists.    The military columns under the command of the Western  Military Command, members of the Border Supervisory Units and  local People's Police Force, and local residents -- a combined  force of 26,000 people -- blocked the routes and attacked and  crushed these terrorists.    Up to 19 May, there were 13 encounters with the terrorists.  During the encounters, 52 terrorists were killed. The  authorities also arrested eight people involved in planting the  bombs in Maungdaw. The authorities also confiscated 16 assorted  guns, 10 40-mm shells, 1,418 assorted mines, 522 hand grenades,  3,611 rounds of assorted ammunition, five communication  equipment, two schooners belonged to the Kalarzo terrorists,  cash 400,400 kyats, and 153 takas.    It has been learned that these hand grenades, mines, and  explosives are provided by the foreign terrorist organizations.  During the clashes, four of our soldiers laid down their lives  for the country while three were injured.    It has been learned that the military columns, members of  the  Border Supervisory Units and local People's Police Force, and  local residents are searching and attacking the remaining RSO or  Kalarzo terrorists.</p>

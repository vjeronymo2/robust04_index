Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 11 GAY COUPLES MARRIED IN DENMARK  </P> <P> Hundreds of people cheered and threw rice as 11 homosexual couples got married  on the day a new law allowing such unions went into effect.  </P> <P> The couples got married in a ceremony Sunday at the Town Hall. Hundreds of  supporters waved flags and threw rice, while a group of Christian  fundamentalists demonstrated nearby.  </P> <P> Denmark became the first country to give homosexual couples legal status when  Parliament approved a gay rights bill in May by a lopsided majority. The law  gives homosexual couples almost equal rights as heterosexual couples but bars  them from the right to adopt children.  </P></p>

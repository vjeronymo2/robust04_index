			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 24 KYODO -- Japan's former Chief  Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura suggested Tuesday [24 May]  the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata is likely to  face a political crisis in July if the government fails to pass  the overdue fiscal 1994 state budget.    Takemura, who heads the new party Sakigake [Harbinger],  mentioned the Japanese political troubles during talks with U.S.  Sen. Bill Bradley, suggesting that Japan's political situation  will evolve under one of three scenarios in the coming months.    Under the first scenario, Takemura said, the cabinet would  resign en masse after Diet passage of the budget, and under the  second the House of Representatives would be dissolved for a  snap election.    Takemura also mentioned a third scenario, under which Hata  may hold onto power after the passage of the budget by forming a  majority cabinet with defectors from the largest opposition  Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and the Social Democratic Party  (SDP).    "If June passes without enactment of the budget bills, the  minority Hata cabinet will face a difficult situation," Takemura  said.    In Tokyo, Hata, in remarks to the lower house's Budget  Committee, renewed a pledge Monday to seek passage of the budget  by the end of the current Diet session on June 29.    Takemura, whose party left the coalition government in  April,  also said "the next several months will be difficult to predict  and (there will be) times when Japan's politics will change even  further."    Takemura served as chief cabinet secretary in the former  coalition government headed by Morihiro Hosokawa, which captured  power last August after 38 years of continuous LDP rule.    Due to the sudden departure of the SDP and Sakigake,  however,  Hata was forced to start his premiership at the end of April  leading the first minority government since 1955.</p>

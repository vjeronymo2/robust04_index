			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Edward Krzemien: "Polish Troubles in Lithuania"] </F>   [Text] In two weeks' time in Vilnius, the presidents  of Poland and Lithuania will sign a Polish-Lithuanian treaty.  Perhaps this will be the end of disputes between the two  countries, which lasted more than two years, about the past.  But it would be hard to expect Polish troubles in Lithuania to  be over with the signing of the treaty.    Attacks on Jan Widacki, the Polish Republic's ambassador to  Vilnius, may serve as an example here. Lithuanian nationalists  have been accusing him of trying to polonize the Vilnius area,  while leaders of the Polish minority have been accusing him of  destroying Polish elements there.  <H5>  Attacks on Ambassador </H5>   "The Polish ambassador to Lithuania does not represent his  country's interests well"--this is what Ryszard Maciejkianiec,  chief of the Polish faction in the Lithuanian parliament and a  member of the leadership of the Association of Poles in  Lithuania [ZPL], said recently while speaking in Warsaw before  the Sejm commission charged with maintaining contacts with Poles  abroad. "His activity exacerbates conflicts among Poles in  Lithuania, and also between Poles and Lithuanians."    On the other hand, Lithuanian nationalists are also sparing  no criticism against Widacki. Seven Lithuanian right-wing  parties issued a special statement six months ago in which they  said that "Ambassador Widacki, through his activities and  statements to the Lithuanian and Polish press, contributes to  the Polish national minority constantly making unjustified  claims."    Ambassador Widacki himself told GAZETA WYBORCZA that he  "deserves" the criticism because he publicly refuses to support  ZPL leaders whose goal is to enclose the Polish community in a  ghetto.    "We have been cooperating with organizations that  implement a positive program. We support the Polish School  Mother Country [Polska Macierz Szkolna] and also Polish folklore  and theatrical bands. We have brought in 225,000 Polish books,  and we have made a donation to a regional hospital in  Soleczniki, in the form of 3 billion zlotys worth of  medications," Widacki says.  <H5>  Three Groups of People of Polish Origin </H5>   The embassy intervenes with the Lithuanian authorities in  all  cases of violation of rights of Poles, which are guaranteed by  European standards and by a Polish-Lithuanian declaration of 13  January 1992. Among others, the interventions concern the  dissolved regional councils, a return of land to Poles, and the  spelling of geographical names and Polish last names. Recently,  there was an intervention in the case of the Lithuanian  authorities ceasing to print Polish textbooks. A majority  of our interventions were successful," Widacki says.    He divides Poles living in Lithuania into three groups. The  first, called the incorporationist group, is based on  the principle that the current Polish-Lithuanian border is just  temporary and that sooner or later the regions will be  incorporated into the Polish state. The group is very weak and  has few members. It includes the oldest generation and also some  extreme activists.    A second group, called the autonomy group, has  as its goal the establishment in Lithuania of Polish  administrative and political autonomy. It has the biggest  number of members from among activists in the Polish minority.    The third group, one of citizens' integration, is  based on the principle of maintaining identity and a cultural  and language separation, but, at the same time, it wants to  integrate with the Lithuanian society and to occupy posts in the  structures of the Lithuanian state. The group is represented  the least from among activists for people of Polish origin.  Czeslaw Okinczyc, a deputy to the Lithuanian parliament, and  also people associated with the ZNAD WILII biweekly and with a  radio station of the same name, are members of the group.  <H5>  Who Is Behind Whom </H5>   Each of those groups looks for contacts with political  groups  in Poland. The "autonomists," who are the most numerous, first  looked for support within the Christian-National Union, followed  by the Movement for the Republic. Then they found an attentive  ear among some politicians for the Polish Peasant Party and the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], which is demonstrated by a  January letter to Poland's supreme authorities with demands of  "autonomy for Poles in Lithuania," which was signed by 82  deputies from those clubs (let us recall that some of those from  the SLD who had signed the letter withdrew their signatures  before the end of January).    Ambassador Widacki explains that supporters of Polish  autonomy in Lithuania are demanding that Poland force the  Lithuanian authorities to implement constitutional amendments,  among other things, and, at the same time, are demanding that  their efforts to build autonomy from the rank-and-file level be  supported financially. They want money for a Polish health  center, a Polish hospital, a Polish university, and so forth.    According to Widacki, that is a dangerous position to take  because it can only lead to exacerbating the conflict between  Poles and Lithuanians.    "That is why we will persistently refuse to support  building Polish autonomy from the rank-and-file level,"  Widacki states.  <H5>  In Defense of Individuals </H5>   I heard similar views in the Polish Foreign Ministry.  "Poland wants to protect the rights of minorities--both  those living in Poland and Poles living abroad--exclusively  based on rights of individuals," says Stefan Meller, a  director at the Foreign Ministry's European Department. "But we  are opposed to any kind of joint rights--that is, to such rights  that lead to recognizing an entire minority as a subject of  international law and to granting it political autonomy."    "The Polish-Lithuanian treaty is supposed to serve the  goal,"  Professor Meller says, "of having rights of individuals making  up the Polish minority in Lithuania observed from every  standpoint."    --According to Lithuanian sources, there are 268,000 Poles  living in Lithuania. The ZPL, even though its membership  decreases each year, is the biggest Polish organization. A year  ago, it had 14,000 members, whereas, currently, the number of  members is 6,000. Apart from that, the Polish School Mother  Country is active in Lithuania and has about 1,500 teachers as  its members.</p>

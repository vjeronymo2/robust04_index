			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SPLASH  </P> <P> Think again about the "Pirates of the Caribbean" at Disneyland, which the  Summer Splash section of May 28 described as a "perfect fantasy-kingdom." Are  there many women, husbands and fathers whose fantasies include the slave/bride  auctions depicted in this "champion of Disneyland attractions" -- auctions that  resulted in rapes?  </P> <P> The reviewer's mention of a ride with scenes inspired by the film "Song of the  South" makes me hope that racism won't follow sexism as a Disney-approved value  for entertainment.  </P> <P> CAROL PRZYBYCIEN  </P> <P> Burbank  </P></p>

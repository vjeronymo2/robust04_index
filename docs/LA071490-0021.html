			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TINKHAM MADE SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION TO LIFE  </P> <P> I had the pleasure of attending Hollywood High School with Harley Tinkham in  the late '30s and USC in the early '40s.  </P> <P> "Ace" was an integral part of what was probably the most fanatic quartet of  track fans that ever lived -- Tinkham, Dwain Esper, Gordon Candee and Jason  Robards Jr.  </P> <P> I feel sure that when the rest of us sports fans check out, Harley will be  there at the finish line, stopwatch in hand.  </P> <P> BILL FRANZ  </P> <P> Tarzana  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ps."-signed report: "Number of Unemployed Falls Under 4 </F> Million; Jagoda Says `Traditional Spring Recovery' Responsible"]    [Text] Nuremberg -- Bernhard Jagoda, president of the  Federal Labor Office in Nuremberg, has attributed the slight  decrease in the number of unemployed to under 4 million  (3,900,416) for the entire federal territory mainly to seasonal  reasons. Particularly in western Germany, the "traditional  spring recovery" has now only covered the continuing economic  and structural tensions on the labor market. "Seasonally  adjusted," unemployment in the old FRG territory increased by  another 20,000. Compared to last year, the number of unemployed  is 416,600 higher. Jagoda said that the demand for labor was  weak in the west. In the new laender, however, there has been a  strong increase in job offers.    Employment continues to show a downward trend in western  Germany. According to provisional figures provided by the  Federal Statistical Office, a total of 28.46 million were  gainfully employed in February. This is 580,000 fewer than in  1993. The trend is also reflected in the statistics of labor  offices. At the end of March, 247,500 vacancies were registered  in the west, 7 percent less than one year ago. According to the  Nuremberg-based Federal Labor Office, this comparison appears to  be more favorable as a result of the recent strong increase in  reported demand of seasonal labor in the agricultural and  catering sector. Without these figures, the number of vacancies  in the first quarter of 1994 was almost 20 percent below last  year's level. However, less than half of the demand of new  labor is even reported to the labor offices.    In Nuremberg, the entire offer of vacancies is estimated to  be the average of the fourth quarter of 1993 -- 536,000. This  was one-third less than in the same period of 1992. Since the  share of new jobs planned to be offered in the long term also  decreased significantly as of late, enterprises are expected to  be relatively reluctant to employ new people in the first half  year of 1994, Jagoda said. The decrease in demand includes more  and more smaller enterprises. There has, however, been a  sizable reduction in short-time work, particularly in the key  areas such as the automotive and machine construction industry.    A different development was registered by labor offices in  eastern Germany. There, short-time work is stagnating at a  level of about 135,000 employees. Yet, the influence of  intervention in terms of labor policy is on the whole  diminishing. Only the so-called job-creating measures were  still increasing in March. A total of 238,175 east Germans are  currently working in fully subsidized jobs. The number of  participants in further training classes and retraining schemes  is, however, continually decreasing. More and more of those  people on early retirement schemes are receiving normal pensions  as they get older. Including the people on short-time work, the  unemployment statistics for the new laender does not include 1.2  million people who would appear in the statistic without some  kind of benefits. One year ago, this number was 500,000 higher.    In the view of the Federal Labor Office, the demand for  labor  in the new laender is clearly superior to the approximately  76,000 vacancies that were registered at the labor offices in  March. It is mainly smaller companies that are creating the  demand, with trends even increasing. The Federal Office,  however, has noted growing reticence among enterprises to  contact the labor office for their search for new employees.  The quota of registered vacancies was 24 percent for the fourth  quarter 1993, while in western Germany it is 37 percent. "We  do not regard that as an image problem but many managers in  enterprises in the new laender obviously still fail to  understand that we are able to offer people with excellent  qualifications," Jagoda said. Thus, communication in the new  laender must be extended quickly. The growing demand for labor  there is regarded by Jagoda as a clear sign for "tendencies  toward economic stabilization and stimulation" in eastern  Germany.    According to Michael Glos, head of the Christian Social  Union  group in the Bundestag, the decrease in the number of unemployed  justifies the hope for a turn of the tide. In a statement, the  Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] has meanwhile noted  that the new figures cannot conceal that the situation is as  serious as before.</p>

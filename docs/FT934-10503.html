			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / Hosokawa to compromise on political reform MR Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, yesterday called for a quick compromise with the opposition Liberal Democratic Party on plans to reform the corruption-prone political system. Mr Koshiro Ishida, management and co-ordination minister, the government's chief negotiator on political reform, will seek a compromise at a meeting today with Mr Yoshiro Mori, LDP secretary general. Mr Hosokawa has implied he will resign if he does not get parliament's agreement on political reform by the end of the year. The LDP lost a general election in July after nearly four decades in power, because of its failure to achieve political reform. LDP leaders do not want to block reform again, though a hard core of older party members have serious reservations about the plans. However, the LDP has delayed the reform plans, to increase pressure on Mr Hosokawa, so the process is at least 10 days behind schedule. The government now aims to get the plans through the lower house by the middle of this month, to give the upper house a month's debate before the parliamentary session closes on December 15. Officially, both sides share the broad aim of the government's proposals, to replace the present system of multi-seat constituencies for the lower house, with a mixture of single seat constituencies and proportional representation. They differ over the numerical split between constituency and proportional representation seats. The coalition has proposed 250 each way, for a 500-seat house, while the LDP prefers a 471 seat house, of 300 constituency seats and 171 chosen through proportional representation. The LDP's strong constituency organisation gives it an interest in pushing for a high proportion of constituency seats. Mr Hosokawa must also satisfy his largest coalition partner, the Social Democratic Party, which believes it would do best under proportional representation.</p>

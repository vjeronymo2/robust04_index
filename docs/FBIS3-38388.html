			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Rauni Vainamo: "East Border Becoming Rio Grande </F> of the North"]    [Text] The border between Finland and Russia has been  described as the most precipitous standard of living divider in  the world. It reminds us of the border between the United States  and Mexico. In that area, the difference in living standards has  created lots of industry around the Rio Grande.    The border between Finland and Russia is quiet but showing  signs of waking up. Three industrial villages are under  construction along the border and a number of joint ventures are  emerging. Trade across the border is taking place, utilizing  various methods.    In the view of the experts, the eastern border, home of  wolves, criminals and bears, should become an impressive facade  towards Europe. The border should be utilized systematically,  from Petsamo all the way to St. Petersburg and the Gulf of  Vyborg.    "Currently, projects are arbitrarily started at the eastern  border. For example, roads and industrial plants may be built in  the wrong areas due to a lack of information," architect Risto  Ali-Kovero, from Sunnittelukeskus Oy, noted with some concern.    Ali-Kovero has prepared a macronetwork plan for the border  area, where the border line has been divided into the following  planning areas: The Petsamo Corridor, The Sea to Sea Corridor,  The Kainuu-Kostamus Corridor, The Karelian Gateway Area and The  Kymi Border Circle. Also included are the Ystavyydenpuisto and  the Saimaa-Ladoga Area.    "During the negotiations, Finland needs some trumps up its  sleeves with which we can show that we are developing the border  area in a controlled manner and that we are not creating an  uninhabited backyard for the EU [European Union]," said  Ali-Kohero.    If approval is granted for studies covering the entire  borderline, more detailed planning, according to Ali-Kovero,  will be initiated as a joint effort involving the Moscow  building committee, Gostroi, the Government of the Republic of  Karelia, and the Finnish Ministry of Environmental Affairs.  <H5>  Village of Kostamus Largest </H5>   Of all the ambitious industrial village projects, the  largest  is the Kospark Technology Park, which is located on the latitude  of Kuhmo in Kostamus.    Business ventures are solicited to Kostamus not only from  Scandinavia, but also from, among other countries, Germany. The  plans are completed and the brochure has arrived from the  printers. The investment costs in the industrial park, which  spans about 15,000 square kilometers, are about 10 million  dollars. The joint venture has already completed the frame of  the main building of the mining industry collective, which is to  be completed first. According to Research Director Hannu  Linnainmaa, from Haka Oy, which is in charge of the project, it  will include 2,000 square meters of space to be leased to  businesses.    "The output is supposed to be environmentally safe, as we do  not want to emit any pollutants into the environment. The border  area is Finland's Rio Grande, but we have to be careful and not  let inflation take the bottom out of the project. There are  already products in Russia, the prices of which exceed world  market prices," said Linnainmaa.    The intent is also to utilize high tech jointly with the  universities.    The company has been founded as a closed private  corporation,  and its domicile is the City of Kostamus.  <H5>  Work Done Close to Border </H5>   The Kostamus Technology Park is located 40-50 km from the  Finnish border. On the other hand, the Svetogorsk and Vartsila  industrial villages are next to the border. The Varn industrial  village, to be built on the Russian side of Vartsila, is part of  the Karelian Gateway project, which was initiated by the  Ministry of Environmental Affairs.    "Two areas in the village of Vartsila have been set aside  for  industrial and business facilities. Completed business spaces  are also available in Sortavala. Janisjoki will also be utilized  for tourism," said Kesalahti Business Ombudsman Kari Oksanen,  who is in charge of the project.    The Varn Industrial Village is almost 30 hectares large, and  the area is currently being mapped. The Russians own 57 percent  of the venture, while the Finns own 43 percent. According to  Oksanen, the minority share was a requirement for capital  infusion from a fund recently established by the Russians.    In Svetogorsk, near Imatra, a Finnish-Russian business park  is operating. The Russians own over 90 percent of the park. The  size of the area is about 7 hectares. On the Finnish side, the  partner in the joint venture is Suomen Imsveto.    "There are already two businesses on the Russian side of the  business park. We provide them with a complete service, from the  acquisition of raw materials to bookkeeping," said Antero  Ikalainen, president of Suomen Imsveto Oy.    New border crossings lead to increased cooperation at the  border. Another contributing factor is the special benefits  granted Karelia through Russian development policies. The  agreement between Finland and Russia regarding adjacent area  cooperation has also helped to some extent. The Finnish state  has appropriated a few million markkas for this cooperation.    The industrial villages, which are to be built in Russian  Karelia, are also pleased by the expansion of the Developing  Area Fund (KERA). A law proposal regarding this has been  submitted to the Eduskunta. According to the proposal, KERA also  should be able to fund start up and development costs for  Finnish ventures when they are established abroad.    Financing could also be arranged for the purchase of shares  in a company operating abroad. According to Pauli Tiainen,  financing manager for KERA, next year's appropriation for this  would be approximately 50 million markkas.  <H5>  Village Retailer Showed Quadrangular Nail </H5>   In village storekeeper Oiva Tikka's store there are boxes of  nails imported from Russia. The hot galvanized iron nails are  resulting in the establishment of an industrial village in the  Russian part of Karelia. The village would benefit all of  central Karelia.    In April of 1990, Tikka started to import nails from an iron  plant located directly across the border. He, in turn, exported  kitchen stoves with four burners to Russian Karelia.    "We met with the Russians for the first time in 1989. We met  with Viktor Kamel, the manager of the iron plant, three times,  after which we prepared a letter of intent, a business  agreement, and also an agreement with a Finnish central firm, "  said Tikka.    Tikka also acted as a product development consultant. He  showed the plant manager a Finnish quadrangular nail and advised  him in the production of more advanced hot galvanized nails.  Tikka estimates that he has imported from the Russian part of  Vartsila about 300 metric tons of iron nails, but the recession  has had a dampening effect on demand.    Today, Viktor Kamel, the iron plant manager, is chairman of  the Board of Directors for the Varn Technology Village. The five  districts of Central Karelia participate in the project. They  are, in addition to Vartsila, Kesalahti, Kitee, Tohmajarvi, and  Raakkyla. Capital stock has been issued and the company has been  registered in Petroskoi.    Kamel is concerned about the lack of decisions regarding the  land areas in the industrial village. The instability of the  political situation makes him weigh his words very carefully  when he speaks in his office, which still is adorned with a  picture of Lenin on the wall.    Viktor Kamel seems to have enough problems even within his  plant. The plant employs 850 people, and, according to him, many  of them are now not needed. "We don't want to let anybody go,  and therefore we now need to find them other jobs. And these  jobs should be produced by the joint venture, which started in  May," said Kamel.    Kamel's wife, engineer Olga Kamel, manages a sewing shop,  located in the area of the iron plant, which employs over a  dozen women. Skila, from Joensuu, has outerwear for children  sewn in the Russian part of Vartsila.</p>

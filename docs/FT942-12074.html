			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: 'If it was not so tragic, it would be funny' 'Our only comfort is that the television broadcasters are making a bigger mess than we are,' admitted an election official in a candid moment. But the authorities at the SABC, the national broadcaster, would have good reason to contest that assertion. Journalists who had planned to cover what should have been the inspiring story of South Africa's historic first all-race elections have been forced into writing about the continuing inefficiency of South Africa's Independent Electoral Commission, charged with running the elections. The list of problems is seemingly endless. The IEC, having botched much of the four days of voting through a string of oversights, now seems hard pressed to complete the counting process properly. At Gallagher Estates, the plush conference centre just outside Johannesburg that was presented to the world as the information nerve centre of the election, nobody seems to know what is going on. Increasingly irritated media representatives are frequently handed out-of-date election results that have been taken off the wire services. The laager mentality - once used to describe obdurate, apartheid-era Afrikaner politicians - has become a better description of many commission officials who have retreated into defensive mode. 'The IEC has taken note of your legitimate complaints and will seek to remedy them at the soonest opportunity,' has become the stock phrase of the mild-mannered Mr Humphrey Khosa, the IEC official given the thankless task of dealing with the media. Mind-boggling declarations such as the fact that 'formally unverifiable votes will be specially counted' are routinely issued. Justice Johann Kriegler, head of the commission, claimed that the assessment and apportionment of all such technically invalid votes would be decided according to 'a quantity thing, a distribution thing, a general pattern thing'. In an effort to speed up the flow of results the commission has jettisoned nearly all the safety precautions installed to prevent voter fraud - first by having to print millions of new ballot papers without the security counterfoils and then, instead of counting ballots only from sealed ballot boxes, declaring that votes delivered in cardboard boxes and even plastic bags are valid. Even more serious, instead of cross-checking each ballot box received at counting stations with information from the respective polling station, all votes received are being counted immediately. After the count, far from being swiftly relayed, as promised, to the hundreds of the journalists gathered at the conference centre, figures are transmitted by modem to two outdated personal computers. Even this limited operation has hit snags; when the wires went down early on Sunday morning, attempts to rouse a sleeping technician to repair the damage were foiled when his mother refused to wake him up. One party official summed it up: 'If it wasn't so tragic, it would be funny.'</p>

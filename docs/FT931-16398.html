			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Losses grow for Lloyd's Names NAMES ON two Lloyd's syndicates face significantly worse 1989 losses than previously feared. Spratt &amp; White syndicate 475 and Evennett syndicate 1035, both specialising in catas-trophe reinsurance business, have reported a signifi-cant deterioration in their results as claims from hurricane Hugo and other heavy losses continue to mount. Syndicate 475, now part of the Knightstone Group, has suffered worst, with losses for 956 Names - the individuals whose capital supports the market - likely to exceed Pounds 125m, more than 500 per cent of the syndicate's capacity - the amount of premium it is permitted to under-write according to Lloyd's rules. On Evennett syndicate 1035, 1,149 Names face losses equal to 150 per cent of its capacity of Pounds 21.9m - or about Pounds 30m. The accounts of both syndicates were left open last year - when Lloyd's declared overall losses of Pounds 2.06bn - because of uncertainty about the level of future claims. Mr Trevor Bradley, chairman of the Knightstone agency, is expected to meet the members' agents who channelled Names into syndicate 475 today. He told 475 Names shortly before Christmas that their losses would be more than 200 per cent. Both syndicates 475 and 1035, whose affairs are now being managed by the Octavian Group, have ceased to trade. Only about 230 syndicates are expected to underwrite at Lloyd's in 1993, a reduction of nearly 50 per cent since 1990.</p>

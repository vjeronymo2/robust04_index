			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SELLING DEFUNCT SAVINGS AND LOANS AT BARGAIN PRICES  </P> <P> Now that Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan scandal has disappeared  from the headlines, along comes one to top it. It's Miami's CenTrust Bank  bankruptcy that will also cost taxpayers over $2 billion (front page, June 24).  </P> <P> Once again I was shocked to read about the criminal mismanagement of the  savings and loans that it is estimated will cost us citizens $500 billion.  </P> <P> David Paul, chairman of CenTrust, lived like a king for years and in effect  sent the bills to us for payment. He helped himself to $16 million in pay  during the last six years as a reward for his mismanagement. He had custom  built a teak dock to house his $7-million yacht. He furnished his bank's  executive dining room with Baccarat crystal goblets, Tiffany ashtrays, pounds  of the most costly silver service and Limoges dinnerware. And that's only part  of the excesses that we will be paying for in the years to come.  </P> <P> It seems to be the same old story. Steal a loaf of bread and you go to jail.  Steal millions or billions and you walk around free like Keating and Paul, not  to mention the President's son, Neil Bush, who was involved in the Silverado  S&amp;L heist in Colorado.  </P> <P> It's time that white-collar bank robbers were punished to the fullest extent of  the law. Pious words from President Bush on this subject are not enough. We are  entitled to action.  </P> <P> LAWRENCE KANE  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

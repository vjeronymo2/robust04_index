During the opening of the World Economic Forum in Davos  this evening, he said this was the truth, even if it had to be  said with "anger and bitterness." The primary aim remains "to  guarantee the supply of humanitarian aid to the people in  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    All military experts were agreed that a comprehensive  "ground  intervention aimed at ending the war would require many hundreds  of thousands of troops." Such an operation would involve many  victims, not least among the civilian population. "The question  as to whether lasting peace could be secured in this manner is  still open." As war has not been banished from Europe once and  for all, the European Union will have to do everything it can  "to develop an effective and credible common foreign and  security policy."</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> THANKS, J.I.: Historians say Eddie Martin (B1) created the airport business in  Orange County, but Eddie Martin always said it was James Irvine of the Irvine  Ranch. . . . During the Depression, when Martin's landing strip had become a  sophisticated airport far behind in its rent, Irvine forgave the debt and  reduced the rent. . . . Finally, when the county overlaid the airport with a  road, Irvine persuaded county supervisors to give Martin an exclusive lease at  its new airport. "When Eddie talked about James Irvine, it sounded like he was  talking about God," said a friend. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / International Company News: Bavarian bank lifted by bad loan provisions BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the Munich-based financial group which has been expanding in northern and eastern Germany, yesterday announced a 22 per cent rise in total operating profits to DM528m (Dollars 310m) in the first half of 1993. This was after risk provisions on bad loans amounting to DM426m, a rise of 5 per cent. The bank, which controls Vereins-und Westbank in Hamburg, said the increase reflected the increase in domestic credit risks as a result of Germany's recession. The latest accounting period is the first for which German banks have produced full details of their risk provisions. This comes ahead of an EC directive requiring such information for the 1993 financial year. Bayerische Vereinsbank, one of Germany's five leading commercial banks, said that partial operating profits - these exclude trading on the bank's own account - were 6 per cent higher at DM792m. Net interest and commission income both increased, but administrative costs were 10 per cent higher as a result of continued growth in east Germany, where Vereinsbank has 74 branches. All figures are compared with half of the full 1992 result rather than with the actual January-June period. This is because the bank has only adjusted last year's total profits, and not the interim results, in line with the new accounting procedures. The bank said group profits from trading on its own account more than doubled to DM150m. Operating profits of the parent bank were 16 per cent higher at DM334m after a 4 per cent rise in risk provisions to DM275m. Credit volume at the parent expanded by 5 per cent over the level at the start of the year to DM124bn. At group level, credit volume was 4 per cent higher at DM216bn.</p>

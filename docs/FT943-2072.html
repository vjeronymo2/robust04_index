			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / No accounting for standards: On the eve of its latest directive, the UK regulatory body faces intense criticism There were only three things wrong with British accounting when the UK's Accounting Standards Board began life four years ago, says Sir David Tweedie, the board's chairman: the profit and loss account, the balance sheet and the cash-flow statement. In other words, just about everything. In the late 1980s, following the collapse of many seemingly healthy companies, his view was shared by many, and the ASB was welcomed as a potential saviour. Seven accounting standards later, the board itself is under attack, as secretive, unaccountable and over-prescriptive, and with tomorrow's issue of accounting standard FRS 7, it faces the strongest wave of criticism yet. 'I'm damn sure this new standard is going to be badly received by industry,' says Sir David. 'If there was ever a honeymoon, it will end in divorce after this.' FRS 7 is designed to limit the costs that a company can meet through setting up a reserve on its balance sheet when it buys another company. Such reserves have been used by some companies to cover all sorts of costs which would otherwise have appeared on their profit and loss account. By removing these costs from the profit and loss account, companies can boost their headline profit figure. The board's aim in curbing this practice is to ensure that users of financial accounts get a fair picture of a company's true profit. But the financial directors and auditors that prepare and oversee companies' financial accounts say that FRS 7 is unnecessarily hardline, and far too detailed. Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed Elsevier, and chairman of the 100 Group of leading company finance directors, typifies the changing mood. 'I am not a critic of the ASB, but I do think there is a trend over time for it to become much more prescriptive,' he says. Audit partners in the leading UK accounting firms say that auditors and company directors need to be able to exercise judgment in the way in which financial results are presented. It is never the case that there will be a single correct way of presenting something in order to give a true and fair picture, they say. Nor is it necessary to ban, outright, a particular practice to prevent it from being abused. Sir David says he would love to issue streamlined standards, which allow auditors to exercise judgment, but that, privately, auditing firms often welcome detailed guidelines so that they can stand up to pressure from companies that want to bend the rules. Auditors are, in effect, hired, fired, and paid by executive management, which may want to present financial information in the best possible light. 'You need a tough auditing profession. It will never be independent as long as the people who mark the homework are the students,' says Sir David. 'Auditors are put under terrible pressure.' In an effort to protect auditors from this pressure, the board has issued seven standards, produced a statement of principles to underpin them, and issued guidelines on an 'Operating and Financial Review' in which directors can describe their company's performance in their own words. It has also circulated draft standards on a range of other topics. But both preparers and users of accounts have criticised the board for this pace of change, saying they are overloaded with draft regulations. Sir David is robust in defending the board on this charge. 'We consulted people on what to do, and we've actually hit the scams,' he says. 'We are issuing about two standards a year. That is hardly excessive. And industry can't have it both ways: they can't ask to be consulted and then complain about the consultation documents we produce.' A more fundamental criticism, however, is of the way in which the ASB makes its decisions. Its nine members are selected by an appointments committee, and weighted towards auditors and finance directors. Its meetings are held in secret and the minutes are not made public. While the ASB engages in extensive consultation, its sub-committee, the urgent issues task force, does not. The taskforce acts swiftly to change rules to prevent companies exploiting individual loopholes that are too narrow to justify a full accounting standard. Its lack of openness has raised concerns that it may bow to pressures from interest groups, or abandon rule changes for reasons that would not have been considered sufficient if aired in public. Several of the more controversial topics the task force planned to tackle were dropped before they reached the agenda, while others were substantially diluted, abandoned or introduced with long implementation dates allowing companies already planning such practices to adopt them unscathed. Sir David admits that there is a problem, and says he would ultimately like to see both the board and the urgent issues task force meet in the open. However, with other board members opposed, this could be some way off. In the meantime, the board plans to hold public hearings in the next few months on accounting for goodwill - an area on which it will be difficult to reach a consensus. Views are mixed on what the ASB's achievements have been in improving financial reporting. 'It has done a valuable job but I think it's still too early to judge,' says Mr Peter Scott, head of Hemmington Scott, a financial information company. 'There is far better quality of information now and it was necessary to have clearer rules. But I'm not sure we're up to interpreting them yet." Mr Allister Wilson, a technical partner with accountants Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'I think the whole financial reporting scene has certainly changed for the good. But that reflects a combination of the recession, the Cadbury committee on corporate governance and other factors as well as the Accounting Standards Board.' Arguably more important than the board itself is its sister body, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, chaired by Mr Edwin Glasgow, QC. It has the power to reprimand companies or take them to court to force restatements if they breach standards. No such enforcement power previously existed. The panel has so far found against companies in 22 of its completed cases. No company has yet challenged the review panel in court. And, with its authority unsullied, it has instilled a new sense of fear in both finance directors and auditors that they will be publicly criticised if they do not comply with accounting standards. But the panel is still only in a position to act on accounting abuses that are obvious from inspecting the public accounts - in which many manipulations will not be transparent. Furthermore, Mr Wilson argues, the review panel 'only gives out parking tickets' - picking on smaller companies and less contentious issues while leaving some more important abuses untouched. Some companies have demonstrated quite clearly that they are still determined to exploit loopholes. A decline in acquisition and merger activity during the recession has reduced the scope for companies to account creatively. Whether the fragile structures now in place will be sufficient to prevent long-term abuses as industry comes out of recession is less certain. The standards and their interpretation by the review panel could yet be tested in court, with the possibility of a verdict that could undermine the ASB's credibility by overturning its view of what constitutes a true and fair picture of a company's health. Mr Wilson is one of many who believe that only a US-style Securities and Exchange Commission, which could not be challenged in court, would guarantee the quality of financial reporting in the future.</p>

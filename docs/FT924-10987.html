			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Management: Taking the risk of disease out of travel - Health Check Much of the blame for the global spread of sexually-transmitted diseases has, in the past, been attributed to the indiscreet meanderings of the military. Now a new agent - the international traveller - is also aiding and abetting the spread of increasingly-resistant diseases. If you travel abroad as part of your job, you should be aware that the risk of picking up a sexually-transmitted disease is higher in some parts of the world than in others. High-incidence areas include Thailand, the Philippines, East and West Africa, as well as parts of the Caribbean and central America. Risk is also related to the number of sexual exposures, number of partners and whether or not a condom is used. Avoid casual anonymous contacts and, in particular, any form of sex-for-pay. Studies have shown that the latex condom provides better protection than the natural skin condom, which is more porous to smaller organisms such as HIV. Post-exposure symptoms may be deceptively absent and, to further complicate matters, the simultaneous transmission of several diseases is quite common. Once the infected traveller comes home, often within the incubation period of a disease, a partner may be unwittingly infected. Travellers who suspect they may have been infected, even in the absence of symptoms, should be examined by a doctor. Sexual partners should also be screened and, if necessary, treated.

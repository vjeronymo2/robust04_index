			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Index-linked buying helps Nikkei back above 18,000 THE NIKKEI average gained for the first time since Monday, rising on late index-related buying after falling through 18,000 earlier in the day, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The index closed up 273.68 at the day's high of 18,559.71, but was still 5.5 per cent lower on the week. It tumbled to the day's low of 17,846.55 early in the afternoon, pushed down by a fall in the futures market, and lower bond prices. Volume was unchanged at 350m shares. Dealers said that despite the rise in the Nikkei, other statistics indicated that sentiment was still bearish. Declines led advances by 545 to 419 with 112 issues unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks fell 1.23 to 1,320.65. The second and over-the-counter markets also declined. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 2.75 to 1,054.7. 'I haven't seen sentiment as bad as this,' said Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, the benchmark for market sentiment, fell Y5,000 to Y600,000. Mr Tobin added that the falls were especially severe in the banking sector, where 'investors have given up any hope of making money'. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y120 to Y1,660 and Fuji Bank lost Y120 to Y1,500. The market found some comfort in the establishment of large-lot investment trusts which are expected to encourage liquidity into the stock market. Mr Nobuhiko Matsuno, director-general of the ministry of finance securities bureau, has asked the big four brokers - Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi - and the Japan Securities Dealers Association to step up sales of these instruments. Foreigners were seen buying international blue chips. High-technology issues were sought on reports that the 4M D-RAM market had bottomed out. Toshiba added Y18 to Y578 and Hitachi gained Y13 to Y774. Tobishima Corp fell Y71 to Y535 on reports that it would make a net loss of Y45bn for the year to March 1992. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 79.23 to 19,542.01 in volume of 24m shares. Roundup MARKETS in the Pacific Rim ended the week on a mixed note yesterday, following the volatility in Tokyo. Taiwan was closed for a holiday.</p>

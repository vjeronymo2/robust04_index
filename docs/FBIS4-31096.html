			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The convention of the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] finished voting in the national sports hall in Budapest  only a few minutes ago. Our colleague has arrived back with the  interview she had with Gabor Kuncze [SZDSZ candidate for prime  minister].    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] Eighty  percent  of the delegates at the convention voted for starting coalition  negotiations with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP]. How do  you see this?    [Kuncze] The convention of the SZDSZ has authorized the  executive body to accept the MSZP's invitation to start  coalition negotiations. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] During the course of the afternoon there was  discussion about the conditions that the SZDSZ would demand.    [Kuncze] [passage omitted] I think that one must not give  details about the conditions now because the negotiating sides  will have to decide in the knowledge of their respective terms.    What I consider to be important at this point is that in  view  of the understanding by both sides that this is not going to be  a coalition formed on the basis of sentiments, it is not a  coalition to be formed between natural allies, both parties must  endeavor to reach compromises, to understand and take account of  the other side's position, and to work to conclude a coalition  agreement acceptable for the country. If this is achieved, then  it will be possible to sign this agreement and the convention  will be able to give its consent.    At the same time, it must be understood that if it were to  prove impossible for either side to take into account the other  side's concerns, then this coalition agreement will not be  reached. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] There have been views expressed within the  party -- and I am talking about the opinion of the membership --  that with this potential coalition agreement the SZDSZ might  reach a compromise that will allow it to gain power within the  coalition but which will endanger its base because a large  proportion or a proportion of the membership does not quite  agree to a coalition with the Socialists.    [Kuncze] I, on the other hand, think that this coalition  agreement can be reached only by the voting support of the  majority of the delegates who themselves had been mandated by  the membership. If this supporting vote is there, then in a  democratic party the minority universally accepts the majority  view. Today I do not see such dangers. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): We have ways of making you buy - Some bank branches are accused of using unfair pressure to sell financial products The question is normally delicately put. Many small businessmen, in discussion with their bank managers over loans, are used to being asked whether they would like some insurance. The key issue - both for the business executive and agencies trying to uphold banking standards - is whether the banks are taking unfair advantage of their influential position and possibly selling customers inappropriate products. Behind the controversy are the efforts being made by most of Britain's high-street banks to step up sales of insurance and pension products to add to their traditional activities of organising loans and overdrafts. One man convinced that banks routinely mis-sell insurance products is Bill Raynes, chairman of the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers, and partner in Sheffield-based financial consultancy Raynes Hodder Davison. He says banks use 'intimidation, duress and coercion' to pressure customers into buying financial products that they either do not need or would do better to buy elsewhere. Raynes denies he is bashing the banks because they are competitors to the 1,700 firms of financial advisers that his association represents. 'I am passing on the stories that I hear from my member companies about banks' activities,' he says. What cannot be denied is that banks are often in a good position to sell such products, because of the leading role they play in the lives of many small businesses dependent on loan finance. In some cases, insurance protection may be required as part of the procedure for fixing up a loan, but head office rules decree that they should not overly push their own products. In recent months evidence has emerged that banks do sometimes take advantage of their special position to 'persuade' a customer that a specific life-product sold by the bank may be advantageous, especially if the bank has just ostensibly done the customer a good turn by arranging a loan. Chris Eadie, the deputy banking ombudsman who investigates bank complaints, says he has looked at a number of cases of alleged mis-selling, involving both small businesses and individuals. The problem is difficult to quantify because of a lack of breakdown in the ombudsman's statistics. In 1992-93 the ombudsman investigated 1,081 complaints of all types, recommending that banks paid compensation in 36.4 per cent of cases. The British Bankers' Association, the main UK banking trade body, says there have been 'a few cases' of mis-selling. The bank managers involved are mainly 'misguided and over-enthusiastic' rather than malicious, the association says. As for individual banks, they deny charges of coercion. National Westminster, for instance, says its branches are always prepared to quote for business but 'would never insist' that insurance was arranged through its own subsidiaries. One complication is that small businesses may not always wish to complain. They may feel that money paid for the insurance product is a small price for favourable treatment. One small businessman in the north-west of England who says he was in this difficult position claims the manager at his branch pressed him to take out two policies arranged through the bank's financial services subsidiary, both covering ill health. Each time the conversations about insurance came up when the bank manager was talking about his overdraft. 'I felt I was being mugged,' he says. One person prepared to go public with his complaint - although his bank denies his claim - is Esmond Watson, owner of Middlesbrough-based Cleveland Camera Company, which runs two photographic shops in north-east England. Watson says he was told by his manager at Yorkshire Bank that a request for a Pounds 10,000 addition to his Pounds 50,000 overdraft would be considered more favourably if he diverted some of the Pounds 6,000 a year going into his current personal pension to a new pension arranged by the bank. Watson agreed to put Pounds 2,400 a year into a new pension arranged by Yorkshire Bank's financial services subsidiary with insurers Clerical Medical. He cut the annual payment in his existing pension scheme organised through Allied Dunbar, another insurer, to Pounds 3,600. Because of the start-up costs of the new pension, the switch is unlikely to have benefited Watson financially, according to independent financial experts. Yorkshire Bank says it never put Watson under any pressure and that the switch was in his best interest. Linking discussions over loans to selling pensions 'is not part of our policy', the banks says. In a third case, the owner of a building company in London had become overdrawn on his Pounds 300,000 overdraft limit and was talking to his manager at Lloyds Bank about increasing it. In a letter seen by the Financial Times, the bank told him it would continue to support him subject to several conditions, one of which involved taking out Pounds 750,000 worth of insurance covering the possibility of accident or ill health being suffered by himself or his business partner. The cover had to be arranged through the bank's financial services subsidiary. After the businessman complained, the bank dropped the condition. Lloyds says the stipulation about going through the bank's financial services subsidiary should not have been made, as the customer should be allowed choice over such insurance. Three questions arise for bank customers with a possible grouse: Is the insurance necessary? (In some cases where loans are being arranged insurance protection against death or ill health may be in the interests of both the customer and the bank.) Is the customer given the chance to shop around? (The bank should make clear that the customer can choose from other sellers.) Is the bank being neutral as regards its influential position on loans? If the answer to any of the three questions is no, the office of the Banking Ombudsman (071 404 9944) will be eager to hear.</p>

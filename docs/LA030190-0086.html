			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: POMONA;  </P> <P> COUNCIL ORDERS RENT STUDY  </P> <P> The City Council, concerned about reports of rent gouging, has asked a city  commission, the city's fair housing agency and a landlord group to study the  problem and make recommendations.  </P> <P> Edna Scott, fair housing coordinator for the Pomona Neighborhood Center, told  the council that landlords are buying up slum property and raising rents  drastically without making improvements.  </P> <P> Tenants who refuse to pay the increased rents are being evicted, she said,  adding that some are unable to find other shelter and are left homeless.  </P> <P> The council, on a 3-2 vote, decided to ask the Community Life Commission, which  oversees city housing funds, to meet with the Pomona Neighborhood Center and an  apartment owners organization to consider the problem.  </P> <P> Mayor Donna Smith and Councilman Mark A.T. Nymeyer voted against the action  after expressing concern that the city might be headed toward rent control.  </P> <P> Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant said imposing rent control would be a last  resort. "If we can possibly avoid rent control, I would lean hard in that  direction," he said.  </P></p>

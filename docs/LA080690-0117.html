			<p><P> August 6, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LATINO INCOME GAP WIDENED IN '80S;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: A NEW REPORT SAYS THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN AMERICA'S RICH AND  POOR HAS INTENSIFIED EARNINGS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LATINOS AND OTHERS.  </P> <P> The difference between the incomes of Latinos and non-Latinos grew in the  1980s, intensified by the wider gap between wealthy and other Americans, a  report issued today said.  </P> <P> Latinos have traditionally earned less than non-Latinos. But the study by the  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said the gap swelled during the last  decade principally because Latino income stagnated.  </P> <P> Latinos are nearly three times as likely to be among the poorest fifth of  American households than among the wealthiest fifth, the report said.  </P> <P> The findings follow recent reports that Latinos are the most undereducated  segment of the U.S. population and the fastest growing. They are expected to be  the largest minority community within 10 years.  </P> <P> The report's findings also came two weeks after the center reported a  post-World War II high in the earnings gap between wealthy and other Americans.  The top 20% of households will receive as much after-tax income this year as  the other 80% combined, the center said last month.  </P> <P> "When the gaps between rich and poor grow, Latinos tend to suffer the same  fates as poor and moderate-income Americans," said Scott Barancik, author of  the new report.  </P> <P> Both reports use 1979-88 data, the latest available, from the U.S. Census  Bureau and the Congressional Budget Office. The income figures are adjusted for  inflation.  </P> <P> The new study found that 28% of Latinos had incomes placing them in the poorest  fifth of households in 1987. About 11% of Latino households had incomes that  put them in the wealthiest fifth that year.  </P> <P> In 1979, the income of the typical Latino family was 71% of the average  non-Latino family. That figure was 66% by 1988, the latest year to draw a  comparison.  </P> <P> Immigrants tend to have a lower income when they first arrive in the country,  Barancik said. But he noted that there is also a substantial gap between the  average incomes of Latinos born in the United States and non-Latinos.  </P> <P> The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is a nonprofit research  organization, financed by foundations, that studies government spending,  programs and policies affecting low- and moderate-income Americans.  </P></p>

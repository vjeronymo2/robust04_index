			<p>BFN     [Text] Cambodian Second Prime Minister Hun Sen claimed King  Norodom Sihanouk could not become prime minister without  changing the constitution, which would require National Assembly  approval.    In a personal letter to the king dated June 18, Hun Sen said  he told the Cambodian Foreign Minister, Prince Norodom Sirivut,  who consulted him on June 13 on the conferring of power to the  king, that Article 17 of the constitution -- which states that  the king reigns but does not govern -- cannot be changed.    Hun Sen said amending the constitution was the mandate of  the  National Assembly. "I further told Samdech Khromkhun that it is  not sure that the Assembly would support any change to the  Constitution," he said in the letter obtained by THE NATION.    Hun Sen said he was forced by circumstances to clarify his  position on the Khmer Rouge problem and on the conferring of  executive power to the king.    In the letter, Hun Sen apologized if his wording might  offend  or inconvenience the king, who is undergoing medical treatment  in Beijing.    Hun Sen complained that while he has done everything  according to the constitution, he had still been blamed for  being an obstacle to accommodating the Khmer Rouge, who are  opposed to the Paris peace agreement, the present constitution  and the elected government.    In the letter, Hun Sen demanded that the king clarify his  plans for Cambodia in relation to an article in the June 23  edition of the FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW.    Despite the king's persistent denial of rumours that he was  about to return to power, Hun Sen said he was deeply shaken by  an article entitled Cambodia: Last Act, especially the parts  which suggested that he (Hun Sen) "is an obstacle to conferring  power on the King".    "What I need right now is the truth about whether Your  Majesty really wants to take power as Prime Minister as has been  published in the media, so that I might assess according to the  real facts," the letter said.    The FAR EAST ECONOMIC REVIEW said Sihanouk had acknowledged  that his bid for power would be doomed without the acquiescence  of Hun Sen and the CPP [Cambodian People's Party] because he  (the King) does "not want to shed blood to fight a secession led  by Hun Sen. [no end quotes as published]    The article quotes the King as saying: "I cannot return to  power to go back to Cambodia unless I have the assurance that  Hun Sen and his party will join me in my government."    In his letter to the king, Hun Sen said: "This paragraph is  very serious vis-a-vis myself because it implies that a war  might break out not by the Khmer Rouge but by my humble person."    He said he was prepared to resign and allow the Khmer Rouge  nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, to replace him if "permitted by  the Constitution, supported by parliament and necessitated by  national interest."    "There is no need to fear that I might wage a secessionist  war," he continued.    In the six-page letter, Hun Sen also said he could not  accept  the Khmer Rouge political programme which he described as "a  coup" against the constitution.    The Khmer Rouge has demanded the dissolution of the National  Assembly and the elected government, and the formation of a new  government with Khmer Rouge participation; and the withdrawal of  government troops from the frontline in return for a ceasefire  agreement and other military concessions.    Hun Sen said it was up to the National Assembly to debate  the  demands of the Maoist group, but as an MP he would certainly  vote against them.</p>

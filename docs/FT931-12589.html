			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): US markets weaker in subdued trading Wall Street US SHARE prices weakened, with secondary stocks taking an especially big beating as investors booked some of the profits earned in the recent rally, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 7.56 down at 3,291.39. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 1.84 to 438.11, while the Nasdaq composite, hard hit by profit-taking, closed 9.26 lower at 697.90. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 277.5m shares. Equities posted big advances on Monday and early Tuesday, but the recent surge of buying seems to have petered out, leaving investors to consolidate their gains and search for a fresh incentive to buy stocks. Hopes that the Clinton administration would take firm action to tackle the budget deficit were behind the rise in prices earlier this week, but those hopes were beginning to dwindle yesterday as the new president got into his first fight with Congress (over allowing gays in the military). The market is worried that if relations between the White House and Capitol Hill sour early, the chances of President Clinton pushing through deficit-cutting measures will be reduced. Pessimism about the political situation depressed prices, and prevented the market from riding the coattails of a rally in US Treasury bonds. The appearance of Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, before the Congressional joint economic committee, had little effect on the market. Mr Greenspan said growth was moving at a firmer pace but that the economy still faced 'headwinds'. American Express fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 23 in volume of 4.6m shares as investors continued to register their dissatisfaction at the decision of Mr James Robinson to stay on as chairman of the group, and to take over the running of Shearson Lehman, the brokerage subsidiary. Westinghouse Electric firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 in volume of 1.5m shares on news that Mr Paul Lego, the troubled company's chairman and chief executive, is retiring. General Dynamics rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 115 after the defence contractor posted fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 174m, up from Dollars 129m a year ago. Union Carbide firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 17 after the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 12 cents a share, an improvement on the 49 cents a share loss recorded in the same period a year earlier. The figures were in line with analysts' forecasts. On the Nasdaq market, profit-taking after recent big gains took its toll, especially of leading issues. Intel fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 112 5/8 , Amgen Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 60, Microsoft Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 86 1/4 and Sun Microsystems Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 1/2 . Pyramid Technology was in strong form, advancing Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 15 in busy trading after revealing fiscal first-quarter profits of 4 cents a share, a turnround from the Dollars 1.56 a share loss reported a year ago. Canada TORONTO stocks closed with a slightly easier bias after active trading. The TSE 300 index lost 1.2 at 3,311.6 and declines led rises by 312 to 290 after volume of 42.7m shares. The 14 stock groups were evenly divided between winners and losers, with financial services down 1.49 per cent. Royal Lepage dropped CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 3.50. The company reported increased fourth-quarter losses and said it would omit the quarterly dividend on common shares normally paid in February.</p>

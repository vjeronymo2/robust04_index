			<p>Language: <F P=105> Belarusian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lilya Hrynyavetskaya: "BNF Sees Perspectives in </F> Elections"]    [Text] Bill Clinton's visit to Minsk and the recent  signing of the collective CIS security agreement were the  reasons behind a press conference held by the Belarusian Popular  Front [BNF].    The two abovementioned events bear such great importance for  Belarus (especially the latter one), so different political  forces have begun to comment on them. Stanislav Shushkevich,  who had long resisted the agreement on collective security and  even spoke of holding a referendum on this issue, has suddenly  changed his principles and signed the documents, which,  according to his own words, may lead to a situation when our  boys will be sent to Tajikistan. Zyanon Paznyak [BNF chairman]  described the speaker's inconsistency as a desire to avoid his  probable dismissal (we would like to recall that the legislative  faction Belarus again plans to put the issue of Shushkevich's  ouster on the agenda, immediately after the winter holiday). It  is not sure whether the legislative majority will praise the  speaker for this accomplishment and forgive him his previous  inflexibility on this issue. Judging by all signs, BNF is not  going to forgive its former supporter for his betrayal of  Belarusian interests (as Paznyak described the signing of the  treaty).    In the opinion of the opposition, the situation in Belarus  has deteriorated considerably recently. This is connected not  only with the deep economic crisis, which, according to BNF, was  caused by the government's clumsy activities, but also with  attempts against the political independence of Belarus.    With the signing of the agreement, the principles providing  for Belarus' nonnuclear and neutral status included in our  Constitution have been annulled, believes the opposition.  Moreover, INTERFAX has disseminated Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich's statement, in which he admitted of possibility of  Belarus joining NATO, should Russia do so first. "What is going  on," complained Zyanon Paznyak, "first the agreement on  collective security, now -- NATO?! What about our nonnuclear  and neutral status?" (By the way, permanent NATO members do not  rush to make room for new members from the former socialist  camp. Instead of full NATO membership, they have come forward  with the "Partnership for Peace" initiative -- a compromise that  has been received by East European countries with skepticism).    Belarus should seek Europe's support, stated Paznyak.  However, the opposition is to take advantage of the upcoming  visit to Belarus by the U.S. President. Clinton will visit  Kurapaty and meet with the opposition, possibly, its leader.  Furthermore, the latter initiative, according to the  opposition, has come from the American side.    In addition to the above-mentioned issues, the opposition  touched upon the unification of the Russian and Belarusian  monetary systems, which, in the opinion of BNF, has political  overtones. They also described the government policy as  treacherous, and compared the situation in Belarus to the 18th  century partition of Poland. At the end of the conference,  Zyanon Paznyak expressed hope that 1994 will be the last year of  nomenklatura rule.</p>

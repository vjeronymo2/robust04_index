			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (7): High hopes for new plant / Profile of BMW 'TO be successful in the world, a company has to be successful in the United States,' said Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, as he broke ground for the company's new Dollars 400m plant in South Carolina on September 30. The German company, which searched the world for three years before deciding finally on the Spartanburg-Greenville area of South Carolina, says it concluded that to be competitive it had to have its own production facility within the US, the largest vehicle market in the world. But the choice of South Carolina took some by surprise. The state is not known for car production and in the minds of many it remains backward, with some of the lowest educational rankings in the nation. But the Spartanburg-Greenville area in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains scores the highest per capita level of foreign investment in the US. Some 165 foreign companies from 17 nations are located there, according to the Greenville Chamber of Commerce. Of these, 58 are German - a factor that no doubt gave some extra comfort to BMW. The German luxury car maker was lured by many of the same enticements as other international companies: relatively low wages in a union-free environment, a first-rate state-operated training programme for workers, tax breaks, good transportation and a strongly pro-business climate. In BMW's case, the incentives package totals about Dollars 150m, not including the innovative programme that will custom train workers to BMW's specifications. The package includes: Acquisition for Dollars 37m of 900 acres of land for the site by the South Carolina Ports Authority. BMW will lease the site for Dollars 1 a year; State and local government commitment of some Dollars 23m in site preparation and infrastructure improvements such as water, sewerage and roads; State backing for a Dollars 45m expansion of the Spartanburg-Greenville airport, although most of this expense will be covered by the federal government; State and local tax breaks worth Dollars 71m over the next 20 years. The price seems relatively small, from South Carolina's point of view. For BMW will invest some Dollars 400m in a 1.9m sq ft production facility and create some 2,000 jobs. And, it hints to local officials, if the market goes its way, that investment - and the number of jobs - could double by the end of the decade. Some 21 manufacturers of vehicle parts and components are also expected to locate near the plant to supply BMW when its starts production in 1995. The state expects these to bring another Dollars 262m in investment and create at least as many jobs as BMW. Just in terms of payrolls, South Carolina estimates the direct and indirect economic impact of BMW's plant and its suppliers will be Dollars 6.4bn over the next 20 years. According to South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell: 'Our investment will be returned to state and local governments in less than five years.' For BMW the relocation is also a good deal. It estimates that production costs in South Carolina will be roughly one third less than those of Germany. The key factor for such reduced costs will be low hourly wages for South Carolina's workers. When the plant opens in 1995, wages are estimated to run to about Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 an hour compared with Dollars 28 in Germany. The United Auto Workers union, which retains its grip on US vehicle production, is vowing to organise the plant. UAW wages average about Dollars 16 per hour. But the union's battle will be uphill in this traditionally anti-union state. The Spartanburg-Greenville area is one of the least unionised areas of the US and local business leaders say they intend to keep it that way. Moreover, resistance from the company can be expected. Mr Helmut Panke, BMW chief of planning, said: 'We don't think we need an intermediary between our employees and management.' The company will produce a new model - the details of which it declines to reveal - in South Carolina for the US and export markets. One thing is known about the new model; its price tag will be less than the Dollars 30,000 US luxury tax mark. BMW's hopes for the new US plant are high. It wants the plant to help it regain the level of sales - nearly 100,000 units a year - that it enjoyed during its heyday in the US market in the mid-1980s. And, although US consumers have been emphasising value rather than luxury since the start of this decade, BMW's 27 per cent increase in American sales from January through August this year is spurring company dreams of glory days to come.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Technology: Blue-chip managers need to branch out - Worth Watching The information technology departments in Britain's blue-chip companies are failing to serve the rest of the organisation because of their lack of commercial know-how, according to the latest report from Research International, of London. The report, 'The Changing Role of the IT Manager', identifies the need for IT managers to show more business acumen, and the authors believe there is a need for IT managers to become increasingly involved as a consultant in other areas of the business. The authors interviewed IT and non-IT managers in manufacturing, service and public-sector organisations in the UK. Research International: UK, 071 235 1277.</p>

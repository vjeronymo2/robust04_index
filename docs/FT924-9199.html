			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Contrasting results at SA Breweries units INTERIM results for the six months to end-September from three subsidiaries of the South African Breweries (SAB) group reflect the deteriorating business climate in the country. Although Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries (PGSI), the recently-acquired glass and wood group, and Amalgamated Beverage Industries (ABI), the country's main bottler and distributor of Coca-Cola, both managed respectable profit increases, OK Bazaars, one of the country's three main supermarket chains, saw attributable earnings fall by 72 per cent. The pressure on consumer spending is reflected in the 4 per cent growth in turnover at OK Bazaars to R2.54bn (Dollars 875m) from R2.44bn during the same period in 1991 - a reversal in real terms of about 10 per cent. Private consumption expenditure will decline this year in South Africa for the first time since 1985. Operating income at OK fell to R58.6m from R75m, while attributable earnings dropped to R2.48m - including a R1.6m loss applicable to outside shareholders - from R8.93m. The dividend was cut to 10 cents per share from 37 cents, on earnings which fell to 20 cents from 71.9 cents per share. Although also reliant on the beleaguered consumer, ABI gave some indication of why it enjoys such a favourable rating on the Johannesburg stock exchange  -a price/earnings ratio of 26.4 - by lifting earnings per share by 15 per cent to 19.2 cents. The dividend was lifted to 8 cents per share from 7 cents. PGSI lifted earnings per share by 10 per cent to 138 cents from 126 cents. Turnover rose to R1.35bn from R1.01bn.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Dollar blamed as Norsk Hydro dips to NKr1.07bn NORSK HYDRO, Norway's biggest company, reported lower first-quarter pre-tax profits of NKr1.069bn (Dollars 156m) against NKr1.624bn a year earlier. The company blamed the negative effect of a strong dollar towards the end of the reporting period. Net profits fell to NKr611m from NKr813m in the first quarter of last year. Norsk Hydro said that net income was strongly influenced by the strengthening of the dollar. 'Altogether, the realised and unrealised effects of foreign exchange movements during the period resulted in a loss of NKr450m, compared with a loss of NKr11m in the first quarter,' the company said. The unrealised exchange loss is expected to be offset over time by the positive effect of a high dollar on future revenues. Group operating revenue rose to NKr16.23bn in this year's first quarter, compared with NKr15.57bn last time. Operating income dipped, however, to NKr1.81bn from NKr1.89bn in the first quarter of 1990. 'The strengthening of the dollar towards the end of this year's first period contributed to an increase in financial charges to NKr852m from NKr318m in the first quarter of last year,' Hydro said. Provision for current and deferred taxes in the first quarter of 1991 amounted to NKr438m, equivalent to 41 per cent of pre-tax income, compared with NKr796m, or 49 per cent of pre-tax income, in 1990.</p>

			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / UK News (Employment): Liverpool City Council workers begin three-day strike Walking out: Liverpool City Council workers yesterday began a three-day official strike in protest against 1,000 redundancies planned among the city's 29,000 employees as a cost-cutting measure. Unions said about nine out of 10 union members had supported the action. They added that all revenue collection had ceased while rubbish remained uncleared and many social services offices were closed. The district auditor has told the Labour-led council to reduce overstaffing.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan ("LRAGIR", "AZG", "RESPUBLICA ARMENIA"  dailies), 05/10/94 -- Armenian "Lraber" TV program reported in  the evening of May 6, the employees of the Armenian National  Security Department (ANSD), together with their Russian  colleagues and Russian Procurator's Office, arrested in Moscow  "Sheremetevo-2" International Airport the former President's  Counselor on National Security Vahan Avakhyan, who was returning  from Sofia. Avakhyan was delivered to Yerevan on the same day  and is charged with an attempt of exporting secret information  from Armenia. This is, in fact, the first case when ANSD has  caught a spy in Armenia.    Vahan Avakhyan has left Armenia at the beginning of this  year. At the end of February his wife, Zaruhi Yavrumyan, was  arrested in the "Zvartnots" Airport of Yerevan, attempting to  take away computer diskettes, containing secret information.  After capturing the diskettes, ANSD has been tracing every step  of Vahan Avakhyan, who left for Bulgaria by that time. Yerevan  was aware of his decision to visit Moscow and knew the precise  time of his arrival to the Russian capital, where he was caught  immediately after leaving the airplane. "SNARK" reports, Former  Counselor of the President, former member of the "Karabakh"  Committee Ashot Manucharyan will be a witness in the action  against Avakhyan. Meanwhile the acting ANSD Chairman David  Shakhnazaryan reported, Manucharyan refuses to evidence in this  regard.    It is not clear yet, for Secret Services of what country V.  Avakhyan worked. But evidently, as long as Russian secret  services are actively participating in investigations, Lubyanka  seems not being indifferent to this country too.</p>

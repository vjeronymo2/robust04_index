			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta, May 22 (ANTARA) -- The Czech Government  will help promote Indonesian export products to the East  European country with a view to correct the imbalance of trade  between the two countries which last year was in Indonesia's  disfavour involving four million US dollars.    The promotion through a trade fair was expected to be one  way  of exploiting the potentials of the Czech market, said Czech  Minister of Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy upon arrival in  Jakarta Sunday.    Through the exhibition in that country, the public and  businessmen there will have the opportunity to know more about  Indonesian manufactured and plantation products, Dlouhy said at  the Sukarno-Hatta International Airport where he was greeted by  Director General of Foreign Trade Joko Mulyono.    Last year, Indonesia's exports to the East European country  reached a value of 10.5 million US dollars and the imports from  that country were estimated at 14.5 million dollars.    Another way which would be tried, according to the first  Czech high government official who visited Indonesia, would be  to increase the meetings between the businessmen of the two  countries to enable them to know their respective market  potentials.    He said his mission to Indonesia included 25 businessmen of  major companies engaged in the automotive, aviation, steel, road  construction, textile, funding, rubber, chemicals, cement and  engineering industries.    They were expected to explore possibilities of trade and  investment between the two countries, he added.    Indonesia's export commodities to the East European country  included textile, tin and natural rubber, while the commodities  imported from that country included machinery and chemicals.    On the occasion, Dlouhy said during his stay in Indonesia he  was also scheduled to sign a new trade agreement between the two  countries after Czechoslovakia split into two.    The Czech officials will also discuss matters relating to  investment guarantee and the prevention of double taxation with  Indonesian Government authorities.    While in Indonesia from May 22 through 25, Dlouhy will meet  Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade Hartarto, Trade  Minister Judono, State Minister for National Development  Planning/Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency  (Bappenas) Ginanjar Kartasasmita, Finance Minister Mar'ie  Mohammad, Bank Indonesia Governor Sudrajad Jiwandono, head of  the National Agency for Export Promotion (BPEN) and the board of  the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KADIN).    In the meantime, third secretary of the Czech Embassy in  Jakarta Zdenek Darebnik [name as received] said trade between  the two countries can now be conducted by l/c [letter of credit]  and payment with the US dollar as hard currency.    He said the dispatch of goods from Indonesia to his country  no longer posed a problem to the trade between the two countries  because the Czech airline company also made a stopover at  Singapore.    The shipment of goods by sea can also be carried out via the  ports in Germany and Poland, he said.</p>

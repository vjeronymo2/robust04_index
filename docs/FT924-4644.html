			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Rubber organisation may have to resume buying AS PRODUCER and consumer members of the International Natural Rubber Organisation continue discussions here on whether or not to proceed with a new international rubber agreement, Inro's buffer stock manager has said that he might have to resume buying shortly in order to stop a further slide in prices. Mr Aldo Hofmeister said that with the industrialised economies still facing difficulties there was little sign of a pick up in rubber demand in the short term. 'With additional production and with no increase in offtake by consumers it could develop to a point where I could intervene,' said Mr Hofmeister. Inro last purchased rubber stocks in October and now has stockpiles of more than 160,000 tonnes. Market analysts say that if prices do not rise sharply in the next month a downward revision of Inro's buffer stock reference price is inevitable early in the new year. The reference price, which reflects production and market conditions, determines when the Inro buffer stock manager should buy or sell rubber. Analaysts expect a 5 per cent cut in the price to be made at a further Inro meeting in January. The present meeting here of the Inro council, dominated by discussions on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement, is due to end tomorrow.</p>

They will, when appropriate, adopt international conventions  and model laws which harmonise and facilitate international  trade and dispute settlements.    In his addendum to the President's Address released  yesterday, Law Minister S. Jayakumar said commercial laws will  be reviewed and modified where necessary to create a "more  predictable legal environment" for businesses to operate.    He also cited two priorities in law reform: patents and  bankruptcy.    New laws will be introduced to upgrade the current patent  system and make it more convenient for Singaporeans to obtain  patent protection for their inventions.    The ministry plans to change the current requirement that  Singaporeans must first have patent protection in the United  Kingdom before their inventions can be protected here.  Singaporeans will instead be allowed to file applications for  patents locally.    On bankruptcy, laws will be introduced to improve the  administration of the affairs of bankrupts, and to protect  creditors' interests without stifling entrepreneurship.    "We will strike a fair balance between the interests of the  debtor, the creditor and society," he said.    There will be greater accountability of bankrupts in the  administration of their estates on the one hand, and speedier  discharges of bankrupts on the other.    He said the ministry will review other Acts of Parliament  which rely on English law. This follows the enactment of the  Application of English Law Act 1993, which makes Singapore's  commercial law independent of future legislative changes in the  UK.    Legislation will also be introduced to abolish all appeals  to  the Privy Council, a move announced by Chief Justice Yong Pung  How on Saturday.    The Registry of Land Titles will convert all lands from the  common law to the land titles registration system. It will also  computerise the Land Titles Register to handle more land  transactions and public searches.    Finally, the A-G's Chambers will provide better legal advice  to ministries and government departments by centralising  services in its civil division.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MCGWIRE SLAMS RECORD BOOK, RED SOX, 6-2  </P> <P> Of all the sluggers in baseball's Hall of Fame, none have matched the feat that  Mark McGwire achieved Wednesday with a grand slam in the 10th inning at  Oakland.  </P> <P> McGwire's 400-foot-plus shot made him the first player to hit 30 or more homers  in his first four full seasons and gave the Oakland Athletics a 6-2 victory  over the Boston Red Sox.  </P> <P> "I was watching (the home run ball) because I knew it was something nobody's  ever done," said McGwire, who in his first three seasons hit 49, 32 and 33  homers. "It's just unbelievable."  </P> <P> McGwire, who sat out Tuesday night's loss after starting 48 consecutive games,  struck out in his first three at-bats against Boston's Dana Kiecker before  walking in the eighth.  </P> <P> Rickey Henderson opened the 10th by walking as a pinch-hitter in his first  appearance after missing seven games with a strained hamstring. After he was  replaced by a pinch-runner, Doug Jennings reached base on a fielding error by  shortstop Luis Rivera, and Dave Henderson was intentionally walked by reliever  Daryl Irvine to load the bases.  </P> <P> Irvine threw one ball in the dirt to McGwire and was replaced by left-hander  Rob Murphy. McGwire hit Murphy's first pitch, a fastball over the middle, for  his fourth career grand slam, boosting his RBI total to 78 and handing Irvine  (1-1) the loss.  </P> <P> Dave Stewart (17-8) won his sixth consecutive decision.  </P> <P> Texas 2, Kansas City 1 -- Bobby Witt won a team-record ninth consecutive  decision and Gary Pettis' RBI single ended 17 scoreless innings for the Rangers  in a win over the Royals at Kansas City.  </P> <P> Witt (12-8) struck out 11 in his fourth complete game. He has won nine of 11  starts and has a 1.75 earned run average during the streak.  </P> <P> Witt took a three-hit shutout into the ninth, but Gerald Perry doubled with two  out and scored on Jim Eisenreich's single.  </P> <P> George Brett singled in the fourth inning for his 2,654th career hit, tying him  with Ted Williams and Lafayette Cross for 50th place on the all-time list.  </P> <P> Milwaukee 7, Detroit 3 -- Rob Deer homered and drove in four runs to lead  Milwaukee past the Tigers at Detroit.  </P> <P> Milwaukee's Tom Edens went four innings in his first AL start, giving up two  runs on five hits. Paul Mirabella (4-2) pitched 2 2/3 innings for the victory.  Dan Plesac got one out for his 18th save.  </P> <P> Chicago 4, Toronto 3 -- Sammy Shea homered and Ivan Calderon had a double, an  RBI and scored a run to lead the White Sox over the Blue Jays at Chicago.  </P> <P> Leading, 3-0, in the fifth, Calderon doubled, took third on a groundout and  beat shortstop Tony Fernandez's throw home on a grounder by Fisk.  </P> <P> Jack McDowell (9-6) gave up five hits in eight innings, struck out five and  walked none. Bobby Thigpen pitched the ninth for his 38th save in 44 chances.  </P> <P> John Candelaria (7-5) lost in his second start for the Blue Jays.  </P> <P> Cleveland 5, Minnesota 4 -- Chris James' RBI single capped a three-run rally in  the seventh inning and Mitch Webster homered to lead the Indians past the Twins  at Cleveland.  </P> <P> Jesse Orosco (4-4) got two outs for the victory. Doug Jones pitched two innings  for his 32nd save.  </P> <P> Relievers Tim Drummond (1-4) and Terry Leach had control problems and played a  key role in Cleveland's comeback.  </P> <P> Drummond (1-4) gave up a single and two walks to load the bases. Then Leach hit  Carlos Baerga, forcing in a run, and Candy Maldonado followed with an RBI  single that tied it, 4-4. James singled home the go-ahead run.  </P> <P> Cleveland starter Mike Walker allowed four runs, on five hits and five walks in  6 1/3 innings.  </P> <P> Seattle 2, Baltimore 0 -- Randy Johnson pitched a four-hitter and Alvin Davis  homered and drove in the Mariners' runs at Seattle.  </P> <P> Johnson (11-7) pitched his second shutout and fourth complete game, striking  out nine.  </P></p>

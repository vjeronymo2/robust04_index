That AD also requires amending the Beech Model 1900D Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) and installing a placard that alerts the pilot of this requirement. This amendment continues all the requirements of the current priority letter AD and requires the installation of parts having an improved design including a CT stator assembly, a CT shroud housing, CT turbine blades, feather seals, and a small exit duct assembly. This amendment is prompted by the manufacturer developing new design improvements that will reduce the susceptibility of the CT blades to high cycle fatigue (HCF) damage. The actions specified by this AD are intended to prevent engine failure and inflight engine shutdown due to HCF failure of the CT blades. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Effective June 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of June 15, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The service information referenced in this AD may be obtained from Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, 1000 Marie-Victorin, Longueil, Quebec, Canada J4G 1A1. This information may be examined at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), New England Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, 12 New England Executive Park, Burlington, MA 01803&hyph;5299; or at the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Mark A.

That action proposed to retain the inspections and Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) revisions required by the current AD, but would also require installation at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD, or December 31, 1994, whichever occurs first, of the improved compressor turbine (CT) turbine stator assembly, CT shroud housing, small exit duct assembly, CT blades, and feather seals. Installation of this hardware constitutes terminating action to the inspections required by this AD. PWC has advised the FAA that December 31, 1994, is the earliest compliance end-date possible due to parts availability. The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with PWC Service Bulletin (SB) No. 14128, Revision 3, dated April 19, 1993; PWC SB No. 14132, Revision 1, dated May 12, 1993; and PWC SB 14142, Revision 1, dated May 12, 1993. Transport Canada, which is the airworthiness authority of Canada, classified these service bulletins as mandatory and issued AD CF&hyph;92&hyph;25&hyph;R1, dated June 1, 1993, in order to assure the airworthiness of these PWC PT6A&hyph;67D engines in Canada.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This engine model is manufactured in Canada and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, Transport Canada has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of Transport Canada, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the comment received.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenter concurs with the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After careful review of the available data, including the comment noted above, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest require the adoption of the rule as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 100 engines of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 87 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 40 work hours per engine to install the improved hardware, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. PWC advises the FAA that it will reimburse operators for the cost of labor and the cost of required parts. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be negligible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

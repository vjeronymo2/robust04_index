			<p>940521 FT  21 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong hears some positive news at last - Simon Holberton on why confidence has revived Hong Kong got a glimpse of a brighter future this week and it liked what it thought it saw - an end for the time being to US interest rate rises and the prospect of President Bill Clinton renewing unconditionally China's most favoured status next month. The resumption of Sino-British talks on the colony's multi-billion dollar airport this week also gave a fillip to confidence which has been under pressure for some months from nervousness about the residential property market, the interest rate outlook, and lack of attention by international investors. Mr Ewan Cameron Watt, head of research at Warburg Securities, characterised the mood: 'It's a revival of confidence in financial assets and we think it is reasonably well-founded.' Taking its lead from Wall Street, the Hang Seng Index rose nearly 5 per cent on Wednesday in the wake of the US Federal Reserve Board's 0.5 percentage point tightening in the Fed funds and discount rates. By the close of trading yesterday it had risen a further 3 per cent, bringing its gain on the week to nearly 5.5 per cent. The prospect of further US interest rate rises in the short term seems to have diminished, although most expect to see the Fed funds rate nudging 5 per cent by the end of the year from its current level of 4.25 per cent. US rates are important for Hong Kong because the colony's dollar is linked the dollar. The market has been looking for good news for some time. Since the beginning of the year, when Hong Kong and other Asian markets fell out of favour with international investors, share prices have fallen by nearly a third from their peak in early January. The change in the direction of interest rates - heralded by the Fed in February with its first rise in the cost of borrowing for five years - also undermined confidence. In addition, comments by Mr Chris Pattern, the governor at Easter that the high level of residential property prices, in Hong Kong was of concern and needed 'exceptional' measures further eroded sentiment. Over recent weeks, however, initial gloom has given way to a slightly more positive outlook. This is reflected in property, where the market has come to realise two things. Mr Patten does not want to be associated with measures which lead to the collapse of the colony's property market. The governor's 'exceptional' measures now look like being no more than an attempt to increase the supply of land for building. Analysts reckon that, at worst prices, may fall 20 per cent, 10 per cent of which has already occurred. With a two to three year building cycle that should leave the house builders' earnings pretty much intact for the near term. Seen in this light the market has overdone its down-rating of the colony's house builders. Mr Peter Churchouse, head of research at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, said that New World Development was trading at a 44 per cent discount to its net asset value, Sino Land 43 per cent and Hang Lung 35 per cent. 'You could argue that the property developers are undervalued,' he said. Mr Cameron Watt noted that discounts to NAV of these magnitudes have not been seen in Hong Kong since 1989-90 when there was a political crisis in China and Hong Kong. Little wonder that in this week's rally it was the house builders' who performed best. The outlook on MFN renewal has also improved in the judgement of some. Hong Kong's investment community believes that come June 3 President Clinton will finally renew MFN. When Dr Henry Kissinger, the former US secretary of state, passed through Hong Kong earlier this week, he told assorted groups of businessmen that in his view Mr Clinton would renew MFN unconditionally. Analysts think at most the President might try to penalise exports from state- or military-controlled companies. Though quite how the US customs service would determine such an origin has people in Hong Kong stumped. 'If he doesn't renew the market is going to be in for an almighty shock. The market is expecting it to go through,' says Ms Janice Wallace, head of research at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Ms Wallace remains cautious, however, about the Hong Kong market. She notes that international investors are still wary of the colony's property market  -believing there exists a possibility of 'melt down' - and the Chinese economy, where inflation remains stubbornly high but the incipient slowdown in economic activity has produced a rise in inter-company debt of large proportions. 'Most overseas investors are being defensive, waiting to see signs of stability,' she said. This week's rally in Hong Kong has been notable for one lacklustre sector: the China related companies. The attraction for China companies - be they 'H' share issues or the so called 'red chips' - has diminished considerably over the past few months. An indication of just how much the enthusiasm has cooled was given on Tuesday with the debut of Tianjin Bohai Chemical. It became the first H-share company to see its share price fall below the offer price on its first day of trading.</p>

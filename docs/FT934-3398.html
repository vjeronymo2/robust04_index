			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Regulations fix pension sales method The selling of personal pensions is a highly regulated business. Firms which sell private pensions must first be authorised by one of the self-regulating organisations which monitor the retail financial services industry. Sales agents must be 'fit and proper', a term which, among other things, generally excludes bankrupts. Sales agents are expected to be trained to understand the products they sell and the population for which they might be suitable. Financial services rules bar them from trying to sell unsuitable policies. Insurance companies have had to pay substantial sums in compensation to people who bought inappropriate plans. Sales agents can be directly employed by a provider, or be a tied agent who, although not employed directly, sells one provider's products exclusively, or an independent financial adviser, who sells the best products of a group of providers. Direct and tied sales agents do not operate unsupervised, at least in theory. Insurance companies are responsible for monitoring the activities of their sales staff and ensuring that they comply with all regulations. Independent financial advisers, on the other hand, may be monitored if they are employed by a large chain. The only check on individual firms is monitoring by Fimbra, the self-regulating body for the industry. In making sales pitches agents must first identify themselves, stating whether they are independent or tied to one company. They must then conduct a 'fact find' of an individual's financial situation and current and future needs. Any thorough review would require sales agents to ask about existing pension arrangements. These fact finds - or the lack of them - have most troubled regulators. It is believed that up to 80 per cent of the pension transfer files examined had too little information about clients and their former schemes for agents to be able to make a suitable recommendation. In completing a fact find to assess a potential transfer from an employer's scheme the sales agent would have to ask for details of its benefits, the contribution levels of both the employee and the employer, and the scope for so-called discretionary benefits which allow trustees to give more generous pensions than those formally described in the trust deed. The agent would also need to know the number of years the individual had been a member of the scheme, the number of years to retirement and plans for any job changes. The sales agent would have to compute the pension benefits received under the employer's scheme and compare them with those expected from a personal pension. Only after this procedure could a sales agent offer best advice about pensions transfers and make a proposal to sell a specific policy. Individuals want personal pensions for a variety of reasons, of course, but the sales agent must advise clients exactly what they might be giving up.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TIMETABLE:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- July 1988:   Tax incentives to encourage individuals to opt out of the              State Earnings Related Pension Scheme become effective,              spurring boom in personal pensions. July 1992:   Lautro, the regulator, issues enforcement bulleting 16              saying that under most circumstances, those in occupational              schemes should stay there. Orders review of early              terminations of personal pension policies - to later find              that 50,000 have lapsed in the third quarter of 1992,              all two years-old or under. Fellow regulator Fimbra issues              similar sales guidance, but no retrospective review. December 3,   1993:      News breaks that inquiry under way by Securities and              Investments Board. Yesterday:   Committee named.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

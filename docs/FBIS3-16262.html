This decision  has been perceived by the opposition as "support for Russia's  imperial ambitions in the post-Soviet area." Deputies from the  National Independence Party, the National Democratic Party, the  People's Front, and a number of other parties (16 in all) are  holding joint consultations and meetings to elaborate a policy  of opposition to Georgia's inclusion in the CIS.    It has reached the stage where the opposition intends to  appeal to the republic's Supreme Court because, in its opinion,  parliament's decision on Georgia's membership of the CIS is  unlawful. Its appeal is based on the fact that this decision  was made by a simple majority of deputies and not two-thirds of  them, even though the republic's legislation contains no clear  ruling on that question.</p>

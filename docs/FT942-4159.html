			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / CU poised to buy French insurer for Pounds 1.46bn Commercial Union, the UK's largest insurance company, announced yesterday that it was at an advanced stage of negotiations for the FFr12.5bn (Pounds 1.46bn) acquisition of Groupe Victoire, one of France's largest insurance companies. Compagnie de Suez, the French financial group that owns Victoire, agreed to enter into exclusive talks with Commercial Union after Italy's Generali announced on Thursday it was withdrawing its interest. Mr Gerard Worms, president of Suez, said the sale of Victoire would bring his group FFr10bn in cash, although it would have to book a FFr1bn loss. He called the sale 'a big relief' because it would conclude more than three years of restructuring for the financial group. Although the deal was not yet finally completed, Mr Worms said the commitment by Suez and CU to conclude it was 'total'. The deal, one of the biggest ever in the industry, marks an important stage in the rationalisation of the insurance market, the pace of which is expected to increase as a result of liberalisation. European Union member states must implement so-called framework directives by July 1. Among other things, the new rules will abolish the system of minimum prices that still operates in some parts of the market. Mr John Carter, CU chief executive, who said his company had first looked at Victoire six years ago, said: 'We believe that the French insurance market offers growth opportunities in life and pensions products.' Mr Carter said the deal would further increase the percentage of CU's revenues earned from life insurance to 40 per cent, increasing the quality of its earnings. Abeille Vie, Victoire's life insurance subsidiary, is the sixth largest life insurer in France. At the same time, Mr Carter said, the deal increases CU's 'position as a major European insurer with an important spread of international business.' If the acquisition goes ahead later this year as expected, premium income from CU's operations in continental Europe will increase to about half its total premiums. CU intends to finance the deal through a mixture of cash, debt and new capital. The group said new equity would amount to about Pounds 500m. Of that amount, Pounds 70m will be issued to Suez, while Societe Generale, the French bank, which owns 3 per cent of CU's issued share capital, has agreed in principle to increase its stake to as much as 6 per cent. CU itself has had a stake in Societe Generale since the latter's privatisation in 1987, subsequently raised to 4 per cent. Last autumn Suez sold its German insurance subsidiary, Colonia, and some other overseas interests to France's Union des Assurances de Paris, the continent's second biggest group, in a deal worth more than Fr11bn.

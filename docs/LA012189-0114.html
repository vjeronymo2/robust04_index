			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A HEADS-UP BOAT TOUR;  </P> <P> GAGGLES OF GEESE, THOUSANDS OF DUCKS, A MULTITUDE OF SHORE AND LAND BIRDS --  AND, FINALLY, A SOARING EAGLE  </P> <P> Way out on Lake Cachuma, somewhere between the call of the loon and the honk of  the Canadian goose, there is the amazing spiel of naturalist Neal Taylor.  </P> <P> "At Lake Cachuma we have seeds that walk, spiders that fly, plants that catch  fish and trees that predict rain," Taylor says to his Eagle Tour passengers  aboard the Cachuma Queen, "and there are 276 varieties of birds, including  three dozen species of waterfowl on the lake."  </P> <P> But only one Neal Taylor.  </P> <P> Taylor's tour-boat passengers are surprised when, in the middle of the lake, he  cuts the outboard. Soon they will be even more surprised when Taylor begins  discourses on such topics as capitalism and conservation, differences between  goldeneyes and common mergansers, the natural history of Spanish moss and how  to cook a coot.  </P> <P> For a few moments, passengers on the bobbing boat savor the quiet of the lake  and the reflection of the Santa Ynez Mountains on the water's surface.  </P> <P> Taylor smiles. To say he had a captive audience is supreme understatement. With  an actor's instinct, the naturalist stretches out his Harold Pinter-like  dramatic pause until his passengers begin to fidget. He then begins his first  discourse of the day about Lake Cachuma, which is just northwest of Santa  Barbara:  </P> <P> "Who's the best fisherman on the lake?" Taylor asks.  </P> <P> "The cormorant," answers a young woman, who, judging from the way she clutches  her high-powered binoculars, bird checklist and Peterson "Field Guide to  Western Birds," is a serious bird watcher indeed.  </P> <P> "Good guess," Taylor declares. "The cormorant is a big eater, excellent at  diving for fish. And extremely smart. I swear that bird knows when the trout  truck arrives and where we'll stock the lake. But actually, the cormorant is  the third-best fisherman around here."  </P> <P> "The eagle," answers a safari-suited fellow who looks as if he had stepped from  the pages of the Banana Republic catalogue.  </P> <P> "Another good guess," Taylor says. "The bald eagle's feet are adapted for  fishing. The eagle has little bumps on its toes so that when it swoops down to  get a fish swimming close to the lake's surface, the bird can hold onto its  dinner. The eagle is the second-best fisherman on the lake."  </P> <P> The sly grin working at the corners of Taylor's mouth and the twinkle in his  eyes lets the passengers know they've been had. "Yeah," he says with mock  bravado. "You're looking at him."  </P> <P> Groans and laughter are overpowered by the roar of the outboard as Taylor  throttles the Cachuma Queen toward the north shore.  </P> <P> With all due respect to the eagle and the cormorant, and with all kidding  aside, Taylor may very well be the best fisherman on the lake. As a teen-ager,  he won several national casting titles. These days, he teaches "The Art and  Science of Fly-Fishing," both "academically" at UCLA and "hands-on" in the  wilds of Wyoming.  </P> <P> Taylor, a mountain of a man with a winning grin, may be entertaining to tour  passengers, but he's anything but to the lake's rule-breakers when he finds  them fishing in the wrong place at the wrong time.  </P> <P> Taylor came to be a park ranger rather late in life because, he says, "I was  spending too much time in the corporate world and not enough time in the  natural world."  </P> <P> He spent the better part of two decades as a salesman for a sporting goods  distributor before becoming Lake Cachuma Recreation Area's park naturalist  seven years ago. Early attempts to market his tours as water nature trails and  wildlife cruises were not very successful. Then the eagles discovered Lake  Cachuma and Taylor and county park officials had a product to market.  </P> <P> Taylor stops the boat again. "This is a free-enterprise lake," he declares.  "Fees collected for day use, camping and tours completely pay for this park,  and no local tax dollars have to be collected."  </P> <P> Passengers, expecting to learn about fish, not free enterprise, are a bit  baffled.  </P> <P> "Thank you for your support," he adds.  </P> <P> Taylor thinks capitalism, in the manner that it's practiced at Lake Cachuma,  can promote conservation. Fees collected from wildlife-watching tours could go  to help preserve animals and their habitat. Whale watchers helped save the  whale, elephant-seal watchers helped save the elephant seal, and perhaps eagle  watchers can help save the eagle, Taylor reasons.  </P> <P> Alas, on this overcast Friday morning, the eagles are elusive. True, the  passengers already have sighted gaggles of geese, thousands of ducks and a  multitude of shore and land birds, but Taylor feels compelled to provide at  least one glimpse of an eagle on any Eagle Tour.  </P> <P> "Where are they?" Taylor mutters under his breath as he pilots the boat into  isolated inlets and scans the high crags and snags where the eagles roost.  </P> <P> America's national bird migrates south from the Pacific Northwest and western  Canada to the warmer climate and more abundant food sources of Central and  Southern California. Eagles often winter in the same spots preferred by  migrating waterfowl -- the state's inland lakes such as Cachuma -- where food  is plentiful and human intrusion is minimal.  </P> <P> Cachuma's eagles arrive in November or December and stay until mid-March.  Wildlife experts believe that birds wintering at Lake Cachuma come from the San  Juan Islands off the coast of Washington.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Declining Population  </P> <P> At the turn of the century, there were nesting pairs of bald eagles in 24  California counties. By 1950, only eight counties could count reproducing  pairs, the decrease partially attributable to the use of DDT from the 1940s to  the '60s.  </P> <P> "Look!" Taylor cries with a mixture of triumph and relief. "An immature, high  in that oak tree."  </P> <P> Binoculars are trained on a brownish-black bird, all but camouflaged in the  branches of the distant tree. The largest raptor in North America (with the  exception of the captured condors in the Los Angeles and San Diego zoos) is not  all that majestic from such a distance.  </P> <P> Every Eagle Tour is different, Taylor says. Sometimes passengers get an  eyeball-to-eyeball look at an eagle perched on a snag near shore. At close  range, when the observer can see the white head and tail, the large, yellow  hooked bill and talons, America's national symbol is truly an impressive sight.  </P> <P> "Look!" Taylor exclaims. "High in the sky!"  </P> <P> Eagles in flight are beautiful to behold. Unlike some other large birds, eagles  soar with their wings almost flat. With a 6- to 8-foot wingspan, they create a  dramatic and distinctive silhouette against the clear winter sky.  </P> <P> And the flight of this eagle on this day has made Taylor a happy man and  delights the tour-boat passengers. Now he can talk of other things.  </P> <P> "I really didn't want the lake at first," Taylor confesses. "It (building a dam  to impound the Santa Ynez River) half-drowned a beautiful valley and it wrecked  one of the best steelhead fishing rivers in the state."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chumash Artifacts  </P> <P> A lot of other people disliked the proposal to form the lake, but when  water-short Santa Barbara resorted to rationing during 1948, the dam and lake  were approved by local voters. Congress appropriated funds and the project was  completed in 1953.  </P> <P> The lake also covered up a lot of human history, Taylor says. "My brother and I  picked up four truckloads of Chumash artifacts and took them over to the Santa  Barbara Museum of Natural History."  </P> <P> It was the abundance of steelhead trout in the river that brought the Chumash  to the area and later attracted several generations of anglers. Dedicated  fishermen say the Santa Ynez River once compared favorably with the Klamath as  one of the state's best steelhead-fishing rivers.  </P> <P> Concerned with the demise of the trout stream, the California Sport Fishing  Protection Alliance recently filed a complaint with the State Water Board. The  alliance wants a study done on how the fishery might be restored. Taylor, too,  would like to see the wild river of his youth restored, but for now, his  priority is protecting the lake's 42 miles of shoreline.  </P> <P> "Now I regard the lake as a wonderful resource -- as a way to enhance wildlife  habitat. This is a remarkable place for birds," he says.  </P> <P> For beginning bird watchers who've traveled long distances for the chance to  sight a bald eagle, it's almost bird-watching blasphemy to opine that eagles  often are not the most intriguing part of the Eagle Tour.  </P> <P> Visitors are sometimes more delighted by the great multitude of birds -- the  flocks of geese taking flight or the clouds of canvasbacks traveling in long,  V-shaped formations.  </P> <P> Sometimes it's the antics of the diving ducks that are most remembered. The  canvasback, a diving duck with a white back, rusty-red head and long black  bill, is almost always sighted on the lake. And visitors are all but certain to  see the bufflehead, one of the smallest diving ducks, a chubby white fellow  with a black back that buzzes more like a fly than a bird.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Great Blue Heron  </P> <P> Other divers include the small, brown, pie-billed grebe and its cousin, the  eared grebe. Because grebes ride stern up in the water, they always seem to be  in danger of sinking.  </P> <P> The lake's longest-legged resident is the great blue heron. Its long neck,  regal bearing and great size make it one of the most photogenic of birds, and  its habit of standing motionless for long periods on one leg make it an easy  target for amateur photographers.  </P> <P> "Cachuma is a great place for the beginning bird watcher," says Joan Lentz,  co-author with Judith Young of "Birdwatching: A Guide for Beginners" (Capra  Press). "There are more than a dozen species of ducks, four species of grebes  and a couple of loons -- a real wealth of wintering bird life.  </P> <P> "The lake's low water level means you can get fairly close to a lot of water  birds," Lentz explains, "and don't forget the perching birds in the park's oak  woodland -- acorn woodpeckers, Western bluebirds, goldfinches, juncos and lots  of sparrows."  </P> <P> Taylor has a breezy approach to bird watching, which may be just what the  beginner needs to get off to a good start, says author Young, "but, uh, he  didn't tell his coot story to a boatload of Auduboners, did he?"  </P> <P> Well . . . yes.  </P> <P> "The coot is the Rodney Dangerfield of the bird world," Taylor declares. "It  doesn't get any respect."  </P> <P> He and the passengers watch one of the gregarious gray, white-billed birds  skitter over the lake's surface on its huge feet and lunge awkwardly into the  air. Not only is it a graceless flyer, but it has a grating kakakakaka call.  </P> <P> Still, the ugly duckling-like bird is kind of cute and one serious birder  nearly drops her binoculars when Taylor blithely asks: "Know how to cook a  coot?"  </P> <P> None of the cooks on board dares hazard a guess.  </P> <P> "First you pluck it, then leave it in a stream overnight. Then you put an apple  inside the bird and wire it to a split green log. Smoke the coot over a  campfire 3 1/2 hours or until golden brown."  </P> <P> Everyone on board but the Auduboner realizes Taylor is pulling their legs.  </P> <P> "Then throw away the coot and eat the apple."  </P> <P> Bobcat, fox and coyote prowl Cachuma's shoreline. About 70 beaver families live  by the lake. Unlike their river-dwelling cousins, Cachuma's beavers don't build  dams. Instead, they occupy burrows in the mud banks.  </P> <P> While much wildlife inhabits the lake's shores, a few visitors expect a thrill  at every turn. "Some visitors expect the Disneyland jungle boat ride," Taylor  complains. "There aren't any pop-up rhinos and recorded bird calls out here.  It's all real."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'That's Nature's Way'  </P> <P> Sometimes too real.  </P> <P> On some occasions, the natural history lesson comes from Charles Darwin rather  than Walt Disney. During one cruise, Taylor maneuvered the tour boat into an  isolated inlet and he and his passengers watched, enthralled, as not 30 feet  away a doe and two fawns nibbled at the lakeside brush. It was an idyllic  scene, pretty as a post card . . . until a mountain lion, with the big cat's  legendary quickness, burst out of the bushes and killed the doe.  </P> <P> "It's one thing to read about survival of the fittest in a textbook; it's  another thing to see it acted out before your eyes," Taylor comments.  </P> <P> "I have to say it was a little like watching the murder of Bambi," admits  Taylor, "but that's nature's way and it's not my job to interrupt it."  </P> <P>  The Eagle Tours, through mid-March, run Wednesdays through Sundays.

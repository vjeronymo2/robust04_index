			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow rallies in spite of fresh drop by bonds Wall Street US STOCKS traded in a narrow range yesterday, holding on to modest gains in spite of another fall in bond prices, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 14.59 better at 3,442.41, the high for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 picked up 1.60 to 451.43 and the Nasdaq composite improved 2.43 to 695.21. New York SE volume was light by recent standards at 195.9m shares, and rising shares outpaced declines by 1,033 to 834. In the wake of Friday's fall in equity prices, the share markets proved their resilience yesterday by opening firmer, with prices showing solid gains across the board in the first 30 minutes of trading. But the gains proved primarily a knee-jerk reaction to the previous session's losses. In the absence of fresh economic news, the markets struggled to find a direction, allowing prices to slip back for a time from their highs. Sentiment was undermined, also, by a sudden downturn mid-morning in the bond market, where inflation-sensitive investors took fright at a sudden rise in commodity prices. Equities, however, were supported by continued strong inflows of cash as investors showed few signs of turning away from stocks, which they view as offering the best potential returns in the low interest-rate environment. Nike jumped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 76 3/8 after the sports shoe and apparel maker reported fiscal third-quarter net income of Dollars 89.5m, up from Dollars 82.5m and a record for the company. Although the profits were slightly below market expectations, investors were impressed by reports that Nike's orders for the next few months were 21 per cent above the com-parable period a year ago. Although bank stocks, troubled by rising interest rates, recovered from early weakness, BankAmerica failed to rally, ending Dollars 1 3/8 down at Dollars 52 3/8 . The stock was weighed down by ratings downgrades from two securities firms, Sanford Bernstein and CJ Lawrence. Vehicle shares were lifted by news of strong car and truck sales for the first 10 days of March: General Motors firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 7/8 , Ford Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 48 7/8 and Chrysler Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 3/8 . Brokerages were higher because of the heavy demand for their services from individual investors, which is boosting commission revenues and asset management profits. Merrill Lynch rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 73 5/8 , Charles Schwab Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 and PaineWebber Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 . Storage Technology, which rose sharply on Friday, added Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 27 1/8 in volume of 2.2m shares on hopes that testing of the company's Iceberg data storage system is progressing well. Canada THE TORONTO market finished higher following moderate-to-heavy trading, boosted by a modest late-afternoon rally after showing little movement earlier in the session. The TSE 300 index gained 14 points at 3,562.0 and rises outnumbered falls by 324 to 289. Volume amounted to 43.6m shares valued at CDollars 358m. Eleven of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the gold shares sector, up 1.8 per cent as the bullion price rose in New York by USDollars 1.20 to USDollars 329.35 an ounce.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (1): Time for a fresh image - Factoring companies, whose function is to speed the cash flow of other businesses, are as vulnerable to the recession as many of their customers. But while factoring has flagged in some countries, other markets have shown surprising growth IF anyone in the factoring industry had believed that it was immune to recession, the past 12 months will have dispelled that illusion. Bad debts and fraud have slashed millions of pounds from its profits. Three of the smaller players withdrew from the market but even some of the larger, well-established groups have received a severe bruising. As it is, the casualty figure was restricted to GT Invoice Factors, a small, though long-established company, and two recent entrants, Schroders and Westpac Banking Corp. GT was forced to stop taking on new business when its financial backer withdrew support while Schroders and Westpac decided to wind down their factoring operations because of the tough trading conditions. But in spite of the gloom, the factors and invoice discounters believe that the end to the recession - when it comes - will give them their chance to become a mainstream financing mechanism for business. 'Factoring will benefit from the attention which is being focused on the issue of late payments and the banks' caution about lending to smaller companies,' said Mr Alan Hughes, chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters (ABFD) and managing director of Griffin Factors (part of Midland Bank). Whether this ambition is realised will depend on the industry dispelling what remains of its negative image for financing businesses in trouble. It will also require marketing managers to devise a vocabulary for the industry which has a stronger appeal to potential customers. Factoring is not a term which means much to many businessmen and women. Kellock decided to label its service as 'cashflow finance' after a survey showed many businessmen and accountants did not grasp the role of factoring. Thirdly, the bank-owned factors may have to devise ways of integrating their factoring and banking services more closely. Allied Commercial Finance, part of Allied Irish Bank, says it is developing a hybrid financing product. In the short-term, though, the industry will be seeking to recover from its worst year for a decade. UK industry statistics compiled by the ABFD, representing 11 of the largest companies in the business, showed growth of just 2.5 per cent in the turnover of companies serviced by its members to Pounds 14.2bn last year. This compares with a 14 per cent increase in 1990 and growth rates in the 25 per cent range in the late 1980s. This slow rate of increase was solely due to a 6.5 per cent rise in invoice discounting to Pounds 8.4bn with both domestic and export factoring recording falls of 2.8 per cent, their first declines since 1981/82. The much smaller companies which make up the Association of Invoice Factors (AIF) fared slightly better. The nine members of the AIF reported a 12 per cent increase in business volume to Pounds 251m last year but this had little impact on the overall level of activity. The slow down in the UK, the world's third largest factoring market, was mirrored elsewhere. Worldwide, factoring companies did Dollars 260bn worth of business in 1991, a 9 per cent increase compared with a 29 per cent rise the year before, according to Factors Chain International, a network of companies in 34 countries. Business volumes stagnated in some of the larger markets but strong growth was recorded in Mexico, Spain, South Korea and Denmark. The UK industry's hopes of an upturn when the recession lifts are based on the flexibility which factoring and invoice discounting offer businesses. Unlike a bank loan or even an overdraft a factoring facility grows in line with turnover. Once a bank manager has lent up to what he considers is a prudent level, taking into account the assets which a business can provide as security, he can usually go no further. In the present economic climate few bank managers will lend more than 40 to 50 per cent of the value of invoices and this figure may go as low as 25-30 per cent for less than first class debtors. A factor, in contrast, will normally pay up to 80 per cent of the value of invoices immediately, with the remainder, minus his fee and interest charges, following when his client's customer pays up. Unlike a bank loan or overdraft, which will have to be renegotiated as the business grows, a factoring facility increases with sales. In addition to handling his client's sales ledger and advancing cash against invoices, a factor will, if required, arrange for credit insurance. There are, however, a number of potential pitfalls. The bank may want to reduce its lending if a business assigns security over its debtors to a factor; businesses on fine margins may find the fees too high; and some customers may react badly if they have a negative view of factoring. For larger, more well established companies, invoice discounting is more appropriate. The client retains control of his sales ledger and only makes use of the cash-in-advance service. Invoice discounting is a riskier business for the factor/invoice discounter because he is not so closely involved in his client's affairs. Clients may be tempted to send in invoices before the goods are shipped, create completely bogus 'fresh air' invoices or hang on to customer payments which should have been passed on to the invoice discounter. 'The invoice discounters have been badly hit by frauds and losses,' commented Mr Nick Sanders, business development director of County Factors. One result of this has been for the invoice discounters to reassess their client lists and move some invoice discounting clients over to a factoring service. Union Discount Commercial Finance, formerly known as Union Discount Commercial Finance, staged a relaunch last October after running into problems with some of its clients. 'We had companies we should have been factoring, not invoice discounting,' said Mr David Pretlove, who was brought in as managing director to resolve the difficulties. 'We have tidied up our book and carried out a major reorganisation,' he said. Union Discount will continue to concentrate on invoice discounting but is being more selective in its choice of clients. It is targeting companies in the Pounds 1m-Pounds 15m range and plans to raise invoice discounted turnover to Pounds 750m over two years from Pounds 200m at the time of the relaunch. Even when companies have avoided frauds, their margins have come under pressure from the tougher business climate. Existing clients have expanded their sales more slowly while new clients have often been outnumbered by clients going out of business. As new clients represent a cost rather than a profit in the first year the performance of many factors has declined. There seems little doubt, however, that there will be a continuing demand for the factoring industry's services since the problem of the late payment of debts appears to be worsening rather than easing. Despite exhortation from the government and the promise, in last month's budget, of a reform of court procedures for collecting debts, demand for the debt collection services of factors seems set to grow. Even the prospect, however remote, of a government introducing legislation to give suppliers an automatic right to claim interest on overdue payments does not appear to worry the industry. 'I don't think legislation would help,' said Mr John Davies, marketing director of Alex Lawrie, a Lloyds Bank subsidiary. 'There has to be a change in the business culture and in the credit control systems companies use.' If legislation were brought in, this would be to the long-term benefit of the factoring industry, according to Mr Hughes of the ABFD. 'In some industries there will always be a delay between a company paying its suppliers and getting paid itself. 'If legislation reduces the vulnerability of companies to late payments then we are in favour. It is short-sighted to say that legislation would reduce the need for factoring.' There is certainly scope for the factoring industry to increase its market share. A recent survey by the Confederation of British Industry found only 2 per cent of companies polled had used a factor. The factors and invoice discounters currently serve about 12,000 UK companies. Alex Lawrie's Mr Davies estimates that the number of businesses with cash flow problems which would meet the factors criteria at 150,000 while the ABFD's Mr Hughes puts the figure as high as 250,000. If the banks maintain their cautious policies on lending to small firms the potential for factoring is enormous. But realising that potential will require a huge effort on the part of the industry to 'sell' its advantages to a still sceptical market place.</p>

			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / Observer: Invisible man What is wrong with Sid, the mythical small punter who worked wonders for the 1986 British Gas flotation? The powers that be behind the flotation of 3i, the country's biggest venture capitalist, have invented their own shareholder hero and christened him Jeremy. Apparently he's a middle-class investor who reads the Financial Times or another broadsheet, and listens to Classic FM. He also has at least Pounds 1,000 to spend on adding 3i to his equity portfolio. Sadly, Jeremy is a rather shy type who doesn't want any publicity, unlike Sid. But if you feel strangely drawn to 3i, maybe you are a Jeremy.</p>

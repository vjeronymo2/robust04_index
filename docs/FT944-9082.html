			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Boycott 'cost US Dollars 400m' The Arab League boycott of Israel cost US companies more than Dollars 400m in 1993, according to a study by the US International Trade Commission. Although the boycott is directed at Israel, US companies are hurt by a secondary boycott which prohibits Arab League states from doing business with foreign companies that conduct trade with Israel. Under US law, US companies cannot comply with the embargo. The ITC found that US companies face delays in concluding deals and difficulty obtaining intellectual property protection. Foreign firms which are not hindered by anti-boycott laws have a competitive advantage. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said the US government would continue to pursue 'aggressively the dismantling of the remaining aspects of the boycott'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The press center of the Black Sea Fleet told an RIA  correspondent today that a meeting of personnel of the Black Sea  Fleet's Izmail river craft unit was held on 19 April. It was  held in connection with the announcement by the Ukrainian  Ministry of Defense that the unit was to be disbanded and the 3d  River Guard Brigade was to be set up in its place. The unit's  sailors have refused to obey the instructions of the Ministry of  Defense on swearing allegiance to Ukraine. The unit's entire  personnel has decided to prevent the seizure by force of the  unit's vessels and coastal facilities and, as a result, river  craft sailors are on alert from today.</p>

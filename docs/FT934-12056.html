			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / DFS prospectus reveals cash moves THE PATHFINDER prospectus for DFS Furniture, issued yesterday, reveals the extent to which Mr Graham Kirkham, executive chairman and, with his family, 100 per cent shareholder, has taken cash out of the specialist upholstery retailer in recent years. In the year to August 1 1993 there were non-recurring directors' emoluments of Pounds 9.54m and pension contributions of Pounds 3.84m. Substantial payments have been paid in each year since 1989-90. Until this month, when Mr Christopher Ferris joined as finance director, the group only had two executive directors, Mr Kirkham and Mr Jon Massey, chief operating officer. The company also paid or proposed dividends of Pounds 7m in respect of the 1992-93 year. Mr Kirkham took Pounds 5.53m of his emoluments in 'works of art and antiques'. As a result of the non-recurring emoluments and the dividends, there was a retained loss for the year of Pounds 2.23m. In future Mr Kirkham will be paid Pounds 200,000 a year plus pension contributions, a company car and medical insurance. The prospectus also reveals that Mr Tony Ashwell, aged 45, one of 16 senior managers in the tier immediately below board level, has been charged with driving whilst disqualified, refusing to provide a breathalyser test and 'a number of other offences' following 'an incident' in August this year. Mr Kirkham and his family will sell about half the company's shares in the flotation which is expected to value the company at about Pounds 200m. The prospectus shows that profits before non-recurring items and tax rose to Pounds 20.8m in the year to August 1 from Pounds 14.9m. This includes interest receivable of Pounds 1.29m and a profit of Pounds 870,000 on asset sales. Sales rose by 38 per cent to Pounds 114.2m. Since 1989 sales have grown at 35 per cent a year compound and operating profits by 46 per cent compound. Operating margins have exceeded 15 per cent each year since 1990. The group has no debt and its cash reserves will be Pounds 13m after the float. Mr Kirkham said the group had 'a proven formula that travels well' and 'an excessive obsession with the bottom line'. Its 27 stores reach about a third of the population of mainland UK, and the group aims to achieve nationwide coverage. That could mean 70 to 80 stores eventually.</p>

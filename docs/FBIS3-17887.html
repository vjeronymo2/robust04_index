According to the academician, recent open hearings at the  State Duma on chemical disarmament excluded a possibility of  speculations on this issue. He said that specialists disclosed  all secrets of the "classified arms".    A refutation was also published by the Russian Defence  Ministry, which clearly said that Russia does not develop or  produce biological arms.    Academician Fedorov and other experts wonder why  "sensations"  casting aspersions on the Russian reputation appear at a time of  Russian stabilization. Ecological problems are most often used  in these "exposures". Rumors claiming alleged Russian holding  of ecologically-dangerous weapons were spread under the pretext  of environmental protection. According to well-informed  sources, another attack to use consequences of Russian nuclear  programs is being prepared.    In the opinion of specialists, chemical disarmament problems  are concentrated around technologies for elimination of combat  poison gases. They have an economic competition basis, and  biological arms problems have a clear political coloring.</p>

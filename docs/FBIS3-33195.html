			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jose Torres Hernandez] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas (Mexico), 18 Feb (EFE) --  Peasants and Indians who are members of 278 organizations in  Chiapas State have asked that the Zapatist National Liberation  Army (EZLN) be acknowledged as a "belligerent force" and that  the mayors of 110 municipalities in the region be removed. "The  acknowledgement would increase the extent of the people's  participation and would foster solutions for the causes that  prompted the conflict, which are the same causes that  precipitated the organizations' mobilizations," Ayala Program  [Plan de Ayala] Coordinator Carlos Ramos told EFE.    The EZLN took up arms in Chiapas on 1 January. It demanded  that land be given to the people and stated its position against  poverty and injustice. On 13 January, the Indian Organizations  Council [Consejo de Organizaciones Indigenas] was established.  It represents a million peasants in Chiapas, which has 3.2  million inhabitants. A document issued by the council said: "We  are making public our unconditional support for the EZLN, and we  are demanding that the federal government designate the EZLN as  a belligerent force, because it complies with all the protocols  of the Geneva Convention."    The Chiapas peasants met 15-17 February at San Cristobal de  las Casas, 780 km to the southeast of Mexico City, and asked  that the 1992 reforms to Article 27 of the Constitution be  repealed. Article 27 was one of the pillars of the Mexican  political system until it was reformed. It regulated the land  ownership issue, which is one of the main demands of the  peasants organized in the so-called ejidos community-held lands.    The Indian Organizations Council in Chiapas called people to  hold marches in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Tapachula, and San Cristobal  de las Casas -- the three most important cities in the state,  which borders with Guatemala -- on 6 March. Members of two of  the council's commissions met with Chiapas Governor Javier Lopez  and San Cristobal de las Casas Bishop Samuel Ruiz on Thursday,  to inform them of the decisions made at their meeting, which is  the second one held during the past month.    The council's social demands include the release of 2,877  peasants and Indians who were arrested in Chiapas on charges  related to the struggle for land; the withdrawal of the Mexican  Army from Chiapas; and the punishment for what they considered  to be "excesses committed" during the conflict. In the  political sphere, the council demanded the removal of 110  mayors, especially 21 mayors who have been charged of financial  misappropriation; an undetermined number of deputies to the  Chiapas State Congress; and judges and prosecutors in the  Chiapas Supreme Court.    "We have increased our demands to include the removal of all  mayors," Carlos Ramos stated.    After the 6 March mobilizations, the council is calling all  peasant organizations in Mexico to a meeting in San Cristobal de  las Casas on 13 and 14 March and to a national march in Mexico  City on 10 April -- the anniversary General Emiliano Zapata's  death. Zapata, who was killed in 1919, has become a hero to the  peasants who are fighting for land, and the Ayala Program has  taken his "land and liberty" slogan as its own.    The armed conflict in Chiapas, which has been suspended  since  17 January, will start a new phase on Monday. On that day,  Peace Commissioner Manuel Camacho Solis will meet with the EZLN  delegates to find political solutions to the situation.</p>

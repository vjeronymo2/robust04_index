			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON;  </P> <P> CONDO, APARTMENT OWNERS TO GET BREAK  </P> <P> Local apartment and condominium owners should find it easier to sell their  property now that city officials have recommended specific changes in the  nonconforming-use provisions of the city's zoning regulations.  </P> <P> Agreeing with the recommendations of the city's planning manager, the City  Council decided to reaffirm its intent to modify amortization and  reconstruction provisions in the zoning code that would make overly dense  apartments and condominiums in the city more attractive to lenders.  </P> <P> Because of a 1978 zoning change that reduced the number of allowable units per  acre, about 10% of the city's multifamily housing units do not conform to  current density standards, according to a report by Michael Bouvier, the city's  planning manager.  </P> <P> The council urged the city's Planning Commission to begin procedures to adopt a  zoning-ordinance amendment that would remove the requirement that multifamily  developments, which do not meet current density limits, must be removed or  modified when "grandfather" provisions to exempt them expire.  </P></p>

			<p>930209 FT  09 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Wills jumps 86% and bids for Platon Wills Group, the industrial, electronic and automotive products company, announced pre-tax profits up 86 per cent, from Pounds 154,000 to Pounds 287,000, in the six months to December 31. An interim dividend of 0.1p is declared - the first for some years - from earnings of 0.3p per share, against 0.27p. In line with its intention of expanding product ranges and distribution channels, Wills is following up December's acquisition of Lightfoot Refrigeration with a Pounds 2.7m offer for Platon International, the USM-quoted instrumentation group, which incurred a loss of Pounds 480,000 for 1991-92. Wills is also raising some Pounds 5.4m via a 1-for-3 rights issue at 16p a share. The rights is not conditional on the Platon offer becoming unconditional. Turnover of Wills in the first half rose from Pounds 7.27m to Pounds 8m and Mr David Massie, chairman, said that the trend was in the right direction with traditionally more favourable trading conditions prevailing in the second half of the year.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Issue by RJR Nabisco to boost war chest RJR Nabisco the US tobacco and food group best known for its Camel cigarette brand, yesterday surprised the stock market by announcing a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.3bn) share issue that could signal the start of an acquisition spree. It plans to offer 300m shares, called preferred equity redemption stock, which will pay a quarterly cash dividend for three years, then convert into ordinary shares on a one-for-one basis. Mr Charles Harper, chairman and chief executive, said the main reason for the share issue was to cut debt from 44.5 per cent to 43 per cent of capitalisation in line with a five-year plan. But only Dollars 500m of the proceeds would be applied specifically to debt reduction, Mr Harper said. The remaining Dollars 1.5bn could be used for one or more significant corporate transactions, such as a joint venture, merger, acquisition, divestiture, asset spin-off, or recapitalisation. 'We have no specific transaction on the table, but this war chest will help us look at things we couldn't look at before,' Mr Harper said. 'There are a number of interesting possibilities. We have been talking to people and will continue to talk to people, to find investment opportunities.' Mr Harper said RJR Nabisco would consider any acquisition that provided a 20 per cent return on equity and fell within its 'area of general competence'. This could include its growth areas of international tobacco, international food, and domestic food - but not the domestic tobacco market, which is in decline. At the end of 1993, RJR Nabisco had Dollars 12.4bn of debt, largely resulting from the record-breaking Dollars 25bn leveraged buy-out of the company organised by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the Wall Street buy-out specialist, in 1989. Last summer - shortly after Philip Morris, the rival US tobacco and food group, prompted a damaging cigarette price war in the domestic market by cutting the price of its Marlboro cigarettes - RJR Nabisco attempted to raise Dollars 1.5bn by issuing 'smoke free' shares pegged to the performance of its non-tobacco businesses. The offer was dropped when not enough takers could be found. Wall Street thought RJR Nabisco was asking too much for the shares because it had sold substantial parts of its international food business to help pay off the buy-out debt, leaving it over-exposed to the highly competitive US market. Yesterday's announcement - and RJR Nabisco's specific reference to using the funds for a recapitalisation - prompted speculation the company may revive the scheme, but RJR Nabisco said it had no plans to do so.</p>

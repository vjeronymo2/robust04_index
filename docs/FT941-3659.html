			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Abtrust Lloyd's has Pounds 38m commitments Abtrust Lloyd's Insurance Trust, one of the trusts set up to take advantage of the acceptance of limited liability capital, has taken underwriting commitments of Pounds 38.3m for the 1994 year of account. The trust said that it had taken a cautious approach and the commitments represented 66.8 per cent of its overall premium limit as allowed by Lloyd's. Its exposure follows the average for the Lloyd's market except for being above average in non-marine property loss or damage and non-marine general liability and slightly below average for aviation and personal accident. For the 1995 year it is looking to achieve underwriting up to its limit. The information came with a report of results from its incorporation on August 25 to November 30 showing net revenue of Pounds 19,560 and net asset value per share at the end of the period of 95.18p. It was granted corporate membership of Lloyd's from January 1. Its next reporting period will be the 16 months to March 31 1995. The net Pounds 28.7m proceeds of the public issue has now been invested resulting in a net asset value of 95.9p at February 28.</p>

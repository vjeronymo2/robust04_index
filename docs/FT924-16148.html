			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / EC close to road tax plan for lorries: Commission proposal moves Europe closer to single haulage market The European Commission yesterday adopted a plan for a mutually agreed system of road tax discs for EC lorries. The move is regarded as an essential step for member states to open up their road haulage markets to each other within the single market due on stream from January next year. The plan, announced by Mr Karel van Miert, transport commissioner, is likely to get approval from the 12, because otherwise individual member states like Germany are expected to go ahead with national road tax systems likely to discriminate against outside hauliers. The Commission's proposal follows a European Court of Justice ruling against German plans unilaterally to introduce a road tax which foreign lorries would have to pay. It was put together on Germany's urging. The measure is scheduled to be decided before the end of the year, to come into effect in January 1994, and will apply only to motorways and lorries over 12 tonnes. The object of the tax is to enable member states to recover infrastructure costs from their road networks, and also to make railway transport more attractive. Germany, for instance, has said it plans to use the revenue to modernise its railways. But no less important is the now improved prospect of the 12 agreeing to road cabotage - allowing hauliers from one member state to pick up and deliver goods inside another member state. Many countries have blocked opening up the road haulage market for fear that their own industry would be undercut. Road hauliers in Belgium, for instance, pay less than a third of the German road tax on a 38-tonne lorry, and would be correspondingly more competitive if allowed to operate inside Germany. National restrictions on outside road hauliers mean that up to a fifth of European Community lorries are driving around empty at any given time. The Commission is suggesting an Ecu929 (Pounds 725) a year minimum tax per 40 tonnes of lorry as a reference, but setting no upper limit. The discs should be easily obtainable, for variable periods of days, weeks and months, and imply neither discrimination against outside hauliers nor border checks, Commission officials said. Where, as in France, a toll system already operates, no change is envisaged. Officials say governments will be able to reimburse their hauliers for excessive costs incurred abroad, apparently at French insistence. Hauliers from poorer peripheral countries such as Greece, Ireland and Portugal are expected to lose most heavily, because of the distances they have to travel. But the final draft of the Commission proposal invokes article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, covering taxation and requiring unanimity, whereas the previous intention was to put it through the member states by majority vote, solely under Article 75 on transport policy. The possibility of a national veto makes it easier for the poorer countries to extract concessions.</p>

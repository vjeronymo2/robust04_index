			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / People: Margree returns The last of the Stock Exchange's three divisional managing directors, Rod Margree, is leaving to take up a new post at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in September, thus signalling the end of a divisional structure set up only two years ago. Margree joined the exchange on secondment from Barclays in May 1990 as managing director of the settlements division, one of three new operating units set up by chief executive Peter Rawlins. Against the background of rapid staff turnover, Margree's tenure makes him one of the longest-serving senior executives at the exchange. His departure completes Rawlins' reversal of the organisational shake-up of two years ago. Having originally indicated he would stay for around two years, it seemed earlier this year that Margree's secondment was to be extended, but the disappearance of his division seems to have hastened his move back to the Barclays group. Formerly the corporate finance director running Barclays' financial institutions group, Margree moves to BZW to become chief operating officer of its markets division, one of four operating areas.</p>

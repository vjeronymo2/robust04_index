			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Amanda Vermeulen] </F>   [Text] The bombing campaign in SA has highlighted the  growing rift in right-wing circles, with Freedom Front [FF]  officials now openly criticising the militant far right.    Any members of right-wing organisations which might be  involved in bombing soft targets and killing civilians were sick  and cowardly, Hoopstad Freedom Front chairman and SADF [South  African Defense Force] Sergeant-Major Obie du Plessis said this  week. "I call them Klipdrift [liquor brand] soldiers -- they  get drunk and then go around trying to be soldiers. They are  fighting a war of cowards and we are not sympathetic to their  cause. It is wrong to kill innocent people."    Du Plessis, a member of the SADF's special services, was  instrumental in organising eight mobile polling stations to  visit rural areas where farmers had refused to provide transport  to polling stations for their workers. He denied farmers in the  Hoopstad, Wesselbron and Bultfontein districts had been  intimidating farm labourers, but claimed that Freedom Front  supporters were being threatened by extreme right-wingers.    Du Plessis said he and Freedom Front leader Gen Constand  Viljoen had received death threats. Businessmen in the area  were being threatened with boycotts if they voted for the party.  "We are accused of being traitors -- of betraying the volk  [Afrikaner people]. But they pose no real threat. These  right-wingers are hopeless and stupid. All they do is play  soldier games. The Freedom Front knows what real war is, which  is why we are negotiating, not fighting for a volkstaat  [Afrikaner homeland]."    Du Plessis, a farmer himself, believed the Front had the  support of 90 percent of the farmers in the Hoopstad district.  However, many had recently resigned from the party, not wanting  to be seen to be supporting the organisation publicly, following  threats from CP [Conservative Party] and other right-wing  organisations' supporters.    Du Plessis, who said he would not serve in the SADF under a  black government, doubted whether there would be an uprising of  farmers against a black-led government. However, he said  attempts by the new government to disarm the farmers, most of  whom fought in the Angolan and Namibian campaigns, could trigger  a "10 or 20-year-long civil war that would make the war in  Bosnia look insignificant. We would not fight a guerrilla war.  After all those years of fighting against the ANC and the  communists precisely because they fought a terrorist war, how  could we turn around and do the same thing? No -- we are  gentlemen and we would never resort to terror tactics."</p>

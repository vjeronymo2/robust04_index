			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oksana Dmitriyeva, doctor of economic sciences, </F> chair of subcommittee on the budgetary system and extrabudgetary  funds of the State Duma: "Budgetary Federalism in Russia:  Analysis of the 1994 Draft Budget Shows That Its Approval Will  Lead to the Further Growth of Inequality Among Regions and Will  Actually Facilitate the Growth of Disintegrationary Processes in  the Federation"]    [Text] In recent months, the government has stated several  times that relations between the center and the regions are  built on the principles of budgetary federalism. Budgetary  federalism presupposes the fulfillment of several conditions.  First, allotment to the budgets of federation subjects of enough  income to allow them to ensure the territory's viability.  Second, budgetary federalism assumes the implementation of a  policy aimed at evening out levels of economic and social  developmen--if, of course, the federal government intends to  preserve its integrity.    The 1994 draft budget provides for cuts in the income  authorities of federation subjects with a one-time expansion of  their expenditures, that is, the principle of correspondence  between expenditures and income in territories' budgets has been  violated. Thus, if in 1993 territorial budgets received 62  percent of total taxes paid, in 1994 they are getting only 43  percent. Cuts in the income of territories' budgets actually  mean cuts in financing for urgent social needs, which account  for 80-90 percent of local budgets' expenditures. Moreover,  local budgets, unlike the federal budget, cannot take advantage  of monetary emissions to cover the deficit being created and  will be forced to cut expenditures on the region's social  infrastructure, from teachers' salaries to financing passenger  transport and upkeep on heating plants.    Moreover, the 1994 budget assumes an expansion in the  expenditures' portion of regional budgets due to the transfer of  housing and social sphere sites from enterprises' balance-sheets  to the territorial organs, as well as several other expenses.  Thus, if before perestroyka the local budgets financed a third  of the investment in the construction of housing and social  sites and two thirds of the costs for them, then due to the  mounting crisis, enterprises do not have this opportunity.  Financing of the social sphere rests increasingly on local  budgets.    This combination--cuts in income authorities and expansion  of  expenditures for federation subjects--can lead either to a  willful halt in the allocation of taxes to the center on the  part of local authorities, which has nothing in common with  budgetary federalism, or else to an increase in the already  excessive tax burden on economic subjects, which will lead to a  cut in entrepreneurial activity, and this process in turn will  cut territories' income even more.    As for the second principle of budgetary federalism--evening  out levels of economic and social development among federation  subjects--in the last two years Russia has encountered a sharp  increase in regional differences. In 1988, the gap between the  territories in per capita income amounted to a factor of 3.5;  today this index has reached a factor of 16-17. A country that  is determined to preserve its state unity cannot permit this  kind of sharp regional differentiation. Otherwise, it will have  to reject federalism and democracy both and move from political  to police methods for regulating conflicts in the federation.    Budgetary policy is above all a means for neutralizing  regional differences. The amount of funds redistributed among  the regions depends on the degree of differences and on what  leveling mechanism society chooses at a given moment. Analysis  of the 1994 draft budget shows that the share of funds  redistributed through the federal budget has decreased by a  factor of 2: if in 1993 the financial support fund (that is,  total funds for subventions, subsidies, and transfers) came to  13 percent of federal budget expenditures, 17 percent if the  variation in the standard for allocating value-added tax is  taken into account, then in the current year this index was a  mere 10 percent. This kind of policy is scarcely justified on  the backdrop of a sharp increase in regional differences.    Actually, it should be noted that the 1994 budget does  include substantial accomplishments toward budgetary federalism:  in it for the first time an attempt is undertaken to create a  single source and unitary rules for financing the regions in  place of the faulty practice of regional lobbying and systemless  agreements. However, the transfer (subsidy) scheme proposed in  the budget requires substantial changes in the principles and  criteria for rendering financial assistance.    First of all, the method for determining transfers takes  into  consideration only current expenses. This provides virtually  nothing for subsidies for investments in the social and housing  spheres, the state of which is what determines regional  differences.    Secondly, according to the proposed draft, 66 of the 89  regions are subsidized. This result is possible either in the  event of an inaccurate scheme for calculating needy regions or  else is connected with the political state of affairs: the  federal center is establishing clearly elevated standards for  taxes going into the federal budget, which in the future will  allow it to guarantee the political loyalty of three fourths of  the regions with the help of subsidies from the center.    Thirdly, the proposed scheme of transfers allows for a  change  in the "rules of the game" with individual regions. Thus, the  financial support fund is divided into two funds: a support fund  for "needy" regions and a support fund for "especially needy"  regions. Only the apportionment for the "needy" regions is  subject to a precise algorithm; there is no such algorithm for  the other, which has had an immediate effect on the distribution  of funds for this part of the fund, half of which is sent to  Kemerovskaya Oblast.    At the same time, the list of "needy" regions is made up  based on the economic indicators for 1993 and does not provide  for expansion at the expense of regions encountering an  increasingly strong drop in the standard of living and  production in the current year. We are witnessing a repeat of  the story of 1993, when on the backdrop of a very strong decline  in production, several oblasts in Central Russia (Ivanovskaya,  Vladimirovskaya, and others) paid maximum taxes to the federal  budget, calculated on the basis of indicators for the preceding  year. This intensified the decline in production and the fall in  the standard of living and predetermined the voting in these  regions for Liberal Democrats.    Finally, the source from which the financial support fund  for  the regions is formed is the value-added tax, that is, financial  assistance to the regions is not a defended article of the  budget: a shortfall in taxes will lead to a cut in the financial  support fund for the regions, which means on expenditures for  the social sphere as well.    Budget, especially the relationship between the federal  budget and the territories' budgets, plays a key role in  maintaining a state's social stability and political unity. It  is worth remembering that the break-up of the Union began with a  budgetary war.</p>

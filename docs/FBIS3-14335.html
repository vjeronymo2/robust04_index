			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Address by Indian Prime Minister Narasimha Rao at the </F> opening session of the G-15 summit at the Vigyan Bhavan  conference hall in New Delhi -- live]    [Text] I declare open the inaugural meeting of the fourth  summit of the summit-level group of South-South consultation and  cooperation, the Group of 15 [G-15].    Excellencies, presidents, prime minister, our honored  guests,  special envoys, ladies, and gentlemen: I have pleasure in  welcoming our distinguished guests, the heads of states and  government, and their delegations to New Delhi on the occasion  of the fourth summit of the Group of 15 for South-South  consultation and cooperation. Though your visit this time may be  short, I hope you will be comfortable and have an opportunity to  see something of this historic city.    This summit represents an opportunity to see how best the  creative energy of our group can be released to serve our common  objectives of peace and development through cooperation and  engagement in a rapidly changing world. Excellencies, we are a  young group, but our concerns are age-old. We are compact, but  our vision extends across continents. To realize our unique  potential as a group, we must emphasize our transregional  personality. Our activities must draw sustenance from and in  equal measure contribute to our cohesion as a group. They  should be comprehensive and imaginative enough to lead to the  willing and positive participation of countries from different  continents, such as we are geographically distant yet compact,  in close cooperation and close in purpose.    These are not easy tasks when urgent and varied domestic and  regional developments demand our attention. However, equally  compelling is the longer-term imperative of steering our  countries toward a balanced and synergy of national, regional,  and global interests. I am convinced that this is extremely  important.    At this G-15 summit we hope to demonstrate that our  absorption in the tasks of today will not come in the way of our  seriously addressing the emerging and transcendent issues of  tomorrow. Excellencies, the pace of change in the last few years  has been rapid. The end of the Cold War, the intensified  globalization of national economies and the technological  revolution are just a few elements of this change. Yet the  transcendent issues to which I refer are still with us. We saw  the promise of peace, but it has been far from realized. Forces  of conflict manifest themselves primarily as attempts to  undermine the nation-state system on which the international  order rests. They have assumed dangerous proportions and  diverse forms -- terrorism, separatism, and fundamentalism. I  believe we in the G-15 have the capacity and the conviction to  mobilize world opinion against such destructive forces as we  represent the quest for peace, security, and stability. We are  fully convinced of the need to introduce reforms in the UN  system and expansion of the Security Council so as to give  representation to the developing world in the council's  permanent membership. These issues are engaging our attention  constantly in the relevant forums.    The importance of strengthening economic and development  cooperation in our interdependent world is recognized around the  globe. Such cooperation alone can deal with the problems of  systemic inequalities, macroeconomic imbalances, ecological  sustainability, stagnation, and widespread poverty.  Protectionist barriers against developing country exports and  discriminatory and restrictive regimes governing the flow of  technology must be lowered. There should be adequate  appreciation of our capacity and potential to not only develop  rapidly, but in the process to act as effective catalyst for the  regeneration of the world economy. We shall exemplify the  intrinsic symbiosis between the interests of the industrialized  countries and those of ours.    Our determination to build up intrinsic capacities to  expand cooperation among ourselves is firm. Extraneous efforts  of developing countries, not least those of the members of this  group, to transform and liberalize our economies and to  integrate them with the global economy is aimed at charting a  new trajectory of growth. This factor, as well as the  substantial progress achieved by some of us, have created the  basis for meaningful and functional networks of relationships --  commercial and technological -- between and among ourselves and  with the rest of the world. Cooperation between developing  countries on a regional and transregional basis has assumed an  urgent dimension for us to extend the frontiers of growth. As  we grow in collective strength, so too will our individual and  joint capacities for development, to enable us to contribute to  the establishment of a more equitable, balanced, and prosperous  world order. Our attempts to intensify our interaction with  regional free trade and economic cooperation arrangements could  affirm the value of open regionalism and of becoming viable  growth centers for the free flow of trade, investment, and  technology across national and regional borders.    Cooperation in the G-15 is tethered to the concrete programs  and projects. Over these four years, the projects we have  undertaken are in various stages of implementation. We have  already made some progress in establishing databases and  information networks on complementarities and opportunities for  mutually beneficial trade, investment, and technology. Some of  our projects operate within the matrices of critical need,  natural advantage, and environmental sustainability. Some other  projects seek to establish and strengthen the much-needed  infrastructural links among our countries, and yet others are  intended to stimulate intra-industry trade and cooperation in  key sectors, such as petrochemicals. The G-15 Business Forum,  which meets regularly along with the summits, is another  concrete expression of cooperation where political purpose is  translated into practical business opportunities. We are  conscience of the constraints -- infrastructural and attitudinal  -- that have so far circumscribed the full potential of  intra-G-15 trade and economic cooperation. This must change.  We also admit that our cooperative projects need to be better  targeted and more effectively implemented if they are to make an  impact. The program itself being a pioneering task, such initial  shortcomings are to be expected. Yet a good beginning has been  made and it is my earnest wish that this summit come up with new  ideas on achieving improvements.    Excellencies, I have continued the practice initiated by His  Excellency President Diouf of Senegal and communicated our views  to the chairman of the G-7 in July 1993. I am heartened by the  response. I am convinced the time is right for carrying such  constructive consultations further.    Excellencies, the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade  negotiations have concluded. We hope that it will, as promised,  bring about further liberalization and expansion of the world  trade to the benefit of all countries, especially the less  developed trading partners. We also expect that the norms and  institutions that we have established in the context of the  World Trade Organization will in their actual operation uphold  the rule of law in the realm of international trade and that the  rights and interests of weaker trading partners will be  protected. They must also take care to ensure that the barriers  to trade that the Uruguay Round is to lower are not replaced by  new barriers against developing-country exports in the guise of  noneconomic concerns. We already have reason to be concerned  about attempts to undermine multilateralism and agreed  frameworks for the liberalization of trade. These manifest  themselves in their resort to unilateral actions, demands for  concessions beyond those agreed to in the round, and attempts to  introduce new protectionist agendas.    All of our countries recognize the importance of increased  investments in our productive and technological capacities for  accelerated growth and development. At the same time, official  development assistance retains its importance. Concessional  funding from multilateral financial institutions -- particularly  in the context of low-income countries, which are striving to  build basic social infrastructure and alleviate poverty -- is an  imperative. The burden of external debt is a key resource  constraint for indebted developing countries. The forging of  innovative growth-oriented solutions as well as  non-discriminatory trade and financial policies are needed to  contribute to increasing the earnings of developing countries.    Our commitment to environmental sustainability is total and  through appropriate policies and measures, we will strive to  implement our commitments under Agenda 21. On this matter of  global concern [passage indistinct] may even human survival, we  in turn expect our partners in industrialized countries to give  effect to their commitment to make available new and additional  resources as well as environmentally sound technologies on  favorable and preferential terms.    Excellencies, we are like the pilgrims that our  poet-philosopher Rabindernath Tagore described in the following  terms: Yet they are coming the pilgrims one and all; coming to  their true inheritance of the world; they are ever broadening  their consciousness, ever seeking the higher and higher unity,  even approaching nearer to the one central truth which is all  comprehensive.    The fact that we have gathered here from three continents of  the earth marks a realization of our true inheritance of this  earth. Our actions in the coming years must confirm that our  group is larger than the some of its parts and it is worthy of  this inheritance. Thank you. [applause]</p>

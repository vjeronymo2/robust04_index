			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Canadians began returning home to salvage what remains from fires that  destroyed 3.7 million acres of forest in three central provinces. Some  roadblocks in Manitoba were lifted, and a group from the Cross Lake Indian  Reserve returned to their homes a few hours later. They were among the 27,000  people forced from their homes by the fires in northern Manitoba, Saskatchewan  and Ontario. No injuries or deaths were reported. Scattered rain and cooler  temperatures helped bring some fires under control, but hundreds of others were  still burning.  </P></p>

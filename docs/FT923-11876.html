			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / State funding for Mersey barrage urged SHAREHOLDERS in the Mersey barrage are to press the government to change its decision not to back the Pounds 1bn plan for an electricity-generating dam between Liverpool and the Wirral to harness the Mersey's tides. They believe the government has misunderstood the project's finances and say there would ultimately be no cost to public funds, instead possibly a profit. They blame ministerial changes since the general election and the absorption of the Department of Energy into the Department of Trade and Industry for the government decision. If it went ahead, the barrage would raise about 30 per cent of its construction costs in one group of loans, based on electricity revenues of 3p a unit. Shareholders want the remaining Pounds 700m as another group of loans, but underwritten by the non-fossil-fuel levy - the money added to electricity bills to develop renew-able sources of energy. All or part of the Pounds 700m might come from the pool of money the levy has already built up, or by charging an additional 4p a unit after generating starts. In the latter case, such assured revenue would mean the Pounds 700m could be borrowed commercially. Whatever route were taken, the barrage company would repay the money to the government. 'We are asking for a non-fossil-fuel levy loan, not a non-fossil-fuel grant,' Sir Desmond Pitcher, chairman of Mersey Barrage, said. Repayment would be slowest if the 4p a unit route was followed, beginning when the barrage was 20 years old. At that point, the barrage would be starting to make large profits as a result of its owners' depreciating it completely in the first 25 years. The barrage needs Pounds 14m to proceed to final design and resolve objections about navigation. Sir Desmond said the company had until November before shareholders had to decide whether to go further on their own.</p>

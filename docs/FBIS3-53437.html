The first overhauled F-7 will roll out of the Pakistan  Aeronautical Complex at Kamra by the end of January.    In an exclusive interview to The News, the PAC Director  General, Air Marshal Dilawar Hussain, said that the F-6 Rebuild  Factory (F-6RF) had successfully overhauled the first F-7 while  mostly using its existing facilities. "We are now manufacturing  some 126 parts of the F-7", the Air Marshal said. "Inshallah,  we would undertake to manufacture some 4,000 parts of the  aircraft by the end of 1994. This capability will increase over  the years."    The F-6 Rebuild Factory, which has undertaken the overhaul  of  the F-7, was established in 1974. It over-hauled the first F-6  fighter in 1981 and its two-seat trainer FT-6 in 1985. The  factory gradually expanded its facilities to undertake the  overhauling of FT-5 trainers. The first overhauled FT-5  aircraft rolled out in 1987 and the first A-5 III in 1988.    Air Marshal Dilawar said the first F-7 was taken up for  overhaul by the factory in April 1993. "We had the necessary  basic infrastructure for the overhaul and had made few additions  to our facilities for the F-7 overhaul," he said.    The F-7 is the Chinese version of the Russian MiG-21, the  mainstay of the India Air Force. The PAF has reportedly bought  some 60 F-7 Ms and 80 F-7Ps. The former is the upgraded export  version of the F-7 while the latter meets the specific  requirements of the PAF with 24 major and minor modifications  over the standard export model. The improvements made by the  PAF interalia include the ability to carry four air-to-air  missiles instead of two and the installation of Martin Baker  Pk-10LZ ejection seats.    The F-7s need overhauling after every 600 hours of flying.  This factory was established with the idea to develop an  in-country capability to rebuild aircraft since the aircraft  otherwise would have to be sent to China for overhaul. This not  only would have cost heavily in foreign exchange but also the  average aircraft availability would have greatly reduced since  the turnaround time from China was between 18-24 months as  against 7-8 months in Pakistan. That also implied that either  the aircraft were unavailable in emergencies or the PAF had to  keep their replacements. Needless to stress, both the options  were very expensive and time consuming.    Now, because of the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, the PAF  would get back the F-7 aircraft sent for the overhaul to Kamra  in the shortest-possible timeframe specially during crisis.  Also, the highly skilled manpower of the PAC would be available  to augment the present resources of the PAF in case of national  emergencies and war. The director general said that the  Pakistan Aeronautical Complex had also been successful in  producing 500 and 800 litre supersonic drop tanks for the F-7s.  They are in addition to 1,140 litre auxiliary fuel tanks which  the factory made for the F-6s. These drop tanks have  considerably increased the endurance and range of the aircraft.    The F-6RF has successfully over-hauled more than 294 Chinese  origin aircraft of various types for the Pakistan Air Force  since its establishment. It also makes some 10,000 parts of  F-6s, FT-6s, FT-5s and A-5IIIs for providing maintenance support  to the aircraft.    The four PAC factories -- the F-6 Rebuild Factory, the  Mirage  Rebuild Factory (MRF), the Aircraft Manufacturing Factory (AMF)  and the Kamra Avionics and Radar Factory (KARF) -- employ around  5,000 people and have, over the years, saved Rs10 billion in  foreign exchange. That speaks volumes about the necessity for  indigenisation of defence industries in Pakistan.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee futures down after earlier sell-off by funds Coffee futures fell heavily in London yesterday in response to the previous day's late sell-off by funds in New York. But traders said the market found strong support above Dollars 3,000 a tonne. 'When New York opened we would have expected London to be down near Dollars 3,100 on the September contract, but it held up fairly well,' said one trader. The November position closed at Dollars 3,195 a tonne, down Dollars 194 or 5.7 per cent. That is still some way above the Dollars 2,848 reached on June 27 after the first severe Brazilian frost sent prices up nearly 40 per cent in a single day. London was feeling the force of the 11 per cent drop in New York on Monday night, when arabica futures fell through the key resistance level of 200 cents a pound to close at 183.60 cents on the second position in a technically inspired pull-out by investment funds. In afternoon trading yesterday, New York was steady, with December up 1.40 cents at 185 cents a pound. 'The coffee trade in general probably feels eventually that the situation in coffee justifies higher prices than this,' said the trader. 'But when funds trade, they can carry all before them.' London saw some buying by roasters yesterday, but many are believed to be awaiting the US Department of Agriculture's estimate of the frost damage to next year's Brazilian crop before making their next move. The report, due to be published on Friday, is expected to put the damage at less than the 40 per cent esti-mated by the Brazilian government.</p>

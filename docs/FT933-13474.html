			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / The Hallelujah budget plan The 'spin doctors' responsible for selling President Bill Clinton's economic plan are distributing a strategy paper entitled, Hallelujah: change is coming. Perplexed that the plan's approval ratings have plunged since its unveiling in February, they are urging officials to ignore the details and simply proclaim the good news that a courageous president is at last taking tough fiscal decisions. But are the cries of hallelujah justified or is Clintonomics one of those phoney religions that will not deliver on its promises? As congressional leaders begin haggling over the final shape of the plan, the first illusion to dispel is that it offers change in any meaningful sense. The one novel element in the original plan was the broad-based tax on energy that was slated to raise Dollars 70bn over five years. This was hardly onerous, as it represented an annual tax equivalent to only about 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product or about a fortieth of total federal tax receipts. Yet it proved too much for senators from energy states who substituted a feeble 4.3 cents per gallon fuels tax that would raise only Dollars 20bn. Hopes of introducing a serious energy tax have now all but evaporated. The Senate's fuels tax is regarded as the outer envelope of what is politically possible and many Democrats would prefer no tax on energy at all. That way, the argument runs, Mr Clinton could send a clear message to the electorate: that he is raising taxes only on corporations and the wealthy and thus is sticking by his campaign pledge not to impose new taxes on the bulk of 'middle income' families. Scaling back or dropping the energy tax leaves a hole in the Clinton plan because negotiators from the House of Representatives are determined to reinstate measures favouring poor families, such as tax-favoured urban 'empowerment' zones, that were axed by the Senate in June. Yet the dispute, while serious, is a second-order issue. The crucial point is that the Clinton plan was never a sharp break from the past. The Dollars 500bn in deficit 'cuts' over five years sound impressive only because they are measured relative to a steeply rising 'baseline' that assumes programmes are automatically adjusted for inflation, growth of client populations and so forth. On White House projections, the structural deficit - the deficit adjusted for the economic cycle - will be about 3 per cent of GDP in 1998, roughly the same as in the late 1980s. Over the next five years the federal debt is set to rise by another Dollars 1.2bn - hardly an exercise in austerity. Allowing for inflation, the package is roughly the same size as Republican efforts at fiscal consolidation, such as President George Bush's much maligned 1990 budget accord with Congress and the original 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction act. Indeed, the impact of the Clinton plan in the first two years (which is all that really matters since such deals are always renegotiated as economic conditions change) is similar to that of the Bush plan. Neither control non-defence expenditure: the expected annual increases are 7 per cent under Clinton as opposed to 9 per cent under Bush. They raise similar amounts of revenue, the main difference being that half of the new Bush taxes were garnered from a broad increase in excise taxes. To transform the budget outlook, Mr Clinton needs either to impose an effective curb on the growth of 'entitlement' spending or to raise taxes substantially on all sections of the population. He is not willing to do either. Even if the healthcare reform due in September is relatively bold, Congress is likely to baulk at measures that really bite, such as rationing of high-tech equipment. Nobody expects serious cuts in federal pensions, the other big entitlement programme. On the revenue side, Mr Clinton is dangerously reliant on tax increases on the 1 per cent or so of families with incomes of Dollars 200,000 or more. If the energy tax disappears, up to three-quarters of the increase in federal revenue may be sought from the wealthy. The plan is to raise taxes on the rich by about a fifth over five years while holding increases on other income classes to 2 per cent or less. This is seen as a just retribution for the greedy 1980s, when the rich gained at the expense of the rest of society. In fact, deep cuts in top marginal tax rates under President Ronald Reagan were associated with a sharp increase in the share of federal taxes paid by the rich. Since the increase in the top rate from 28 per cent to 31 per cent in 1990, tax receipts from the wealthy have fallen in absolute terms. Like it or not, the rich will always enjoy considerable discretion over how hard they work and, more important, how much of their income they declare for tax purposes. There can be no certainty that jacking up marginal tax rates from 31 per cent to 40 per cent or more will raise large additional sums from this fiscally-sophisticated group. In this respect, the Clinton plan is even less plausible than previous Republican attempts to reduce the deficit. If the economy strengthens markedly in the next two years, the deficit could fall faster than expected for cyclical reasons. But it would be a temporary reprieve as nothing has yet been done to correct the adverse longer-term trends. The hallelujahs are premature.</p>

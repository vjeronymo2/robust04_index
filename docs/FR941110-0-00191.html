			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters suggested that we provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that if a facility wants its financial condition considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it must fully disclose all financial information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As stated above, it is a statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that a facility's financial condition be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered as a factor to determine the amount of the civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalty. We do not specify in the regulation what we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will examine in determining the facility's financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition, because these factors are unique for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility to furnish the information it believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriately represents its financial status. We consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a facility's financial condition in conjunction with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other factors specified in the rule when determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amount of a civil money penalty, because it is not our  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intent to put facilities out of business, and the amount of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the civil money penalty is determined on a case by case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We received a suggestion to remove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's financial condition as a factor in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of the civil money penalty but to permit the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility an opportunity to negotiate a payment schedule if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it can demonstrate that the civil money penalty would cause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial hardship after the assessment and final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjudication of a civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We do not accept this comment. First, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously stated, it is a statutory requirement to consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a facility's financial condition as a factor in determining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of the penalty. Second, to negotiate a payment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schedule based on the facility's financial condition after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the assessment and final adjudication of a civil money  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalty would not be necessary since the facility's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial condition has already been considered in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination of the penalty amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Many commenters submitted examples of existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State civil money penalty systems which assigned a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar amount per bed to each scope and severity level or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned a maximum daily fine amount for each scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity level. Another commenter asked that we clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that there will not be a correlation between the number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beds and the amount of the civil money penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We are revising &sect;&sect;488.404 and 488.408 to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> correlate the seriousness of the deficiencies with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> selection of remedies when HCFA or the State chooses to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impose a remedy. (See explanation at &sect;488.404, Factors to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be considered in selecting remedies and &sect;488.408,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Selection of remedies.) Civil money penalties may be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for deficiencies constituting immediate jeopardy. Civil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> money penalties may also be used for deficiencies which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constitute no actual harm but have a potential for more than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal harm; or for deficiencies that constitute actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> harm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not accept the comment suggesting assigning a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dollar amount per bed because the regulation, in accordance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with section 1128A of the Act, requires a consideration of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility's financial condition in the determination of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> civil money penalty amount. We assume that a primary reason  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some States compute civil money penalty amounts based on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of beds is to take into account the financial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of facilities, that is, the larger facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be presumed to have a greater availability of cash  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than the smaller facilities. This is not necessarily the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case, and even if it were a valid consideration in some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases, to take this relationship into account would be to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consider financial condition twice. Nor have we assigned a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific dollar amount for each degree of seriousness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

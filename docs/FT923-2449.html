			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Patten warns on teachers' award A TOUGH warning from the government to the teachers' pay review body yesterday to keep down the cost of this year's salary award for teachers gave further evidence of the Treasury's determination to contain public-sector pay. Mr John Patten, education secretary, told the review body: 'It is unacceptable if, over time, the review bodies recommend settlements in excess of those being obtained . . .in the private and public sectors.' After this year's teachers' pay settlement of 7.8 per cent, and 9.5 per cent the year before, Mr Patten's evidence is a warning to the review body not to award another significant real increase. Mr Patten said bluntly: 'The government is determined that the public sector should not be insulated from the further downward adjustments to pay settlements which are essential elsewhere in the economy to improve our international competitiveness and employment prospects.' He pointed to increases in teacher supply to justify restraint. Applications this year for entry to training courses are a quarter up on last year, with trainee numbers in the past two years sharply up and teacher vacancies sharply down. The review body, chaired by Sir Graham Day, is also being asked by the government to design a performance pay scheme. Mr Patten called for 'far-reaching' modifications to the pay structure. He opposed an increase in the number of responsibility allowances, wanting instead to link 'a larger proportion of the pay bill to performance rather than through higher pay awards'. The review body will make its recommendation in January. Teachers' unions have called for rises between 9 per cent and 16 per cent. This year's review body recommendation was met and the government has pledged to honour recommendations in all but exceptional circumstances.</p>

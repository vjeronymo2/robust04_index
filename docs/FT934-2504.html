			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Hanson to sell Bristol site Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, has agreed to sell part of a 56-acre site in south Bristol as a campus for a further-education college. This follows the failure to find a single purchaser for the site, which incorporates one of Europe's largest air-conditioned factories. The company plans to develop the site, once the headquarters of Imperial Tobacco, which Hanson acquired in 1986, as a campus for South Bristol College. The factory will be demolished and replaced by an enterprise centre and a non-food retail and leisure complex. Hanson estimates that the scheme will cost up to Pounds 35m and that 1,200 jobs will be created.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARTIST BUILDS A BETTER WORLD;  </P> <P> TECHNOLOGY: WITH THE HELP OF SCIENCE, TOM VAN SANT CREATES A REMARKABLY  DETAILED IMAGE OF THE EARTH AS IT APPEARS FROM SPACE.  </P> <P> The globe on your bookshelf was never like the GeoSphere.  </P> <P> Instead of man-imposed borders and artificially colored countries, there's a  picture-perfect, remarkably detailed, cloudless image of the Earth's land  masses and oceans, pretty much as they appear from space.  </P> <P> As the globe rotates, light from an artificial sun throws some continents into  shadows or "night," and then tiny optic fibers wink on to mark the light show  of the world's major cities after dark.  </P> <P> The image is a complex mosaic, created over the last year and a half, of  thousands of satellite photos pieced together by a team of artists, computer  experts and scientists under the direction of Santa Monica artist Tom Van Sant.  He financed the project first with a $30,000 grant from the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, then by using the proceeds from the sale  of his Los Feliz home, then by stretching his credit to the breaking point.  </P> <P> Computer-graphics experts from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena joined  Van Sant's team, mostly in their spare time, to create the technology that made  the image possible. Before they were finished, they had not only invented  methods for Van Sant to correct color distortions in satellite pictures but  also devised a program that permitted Van Sant to see through the clouds that  perpetually blanket parts of the Earth.  </P> <P> The "globe" the team produced could revolutionize the globe industry when it  enters the market, as early as next year, says Jon Hultman, an executive with  Replogle Globes Inc., an Illinois-based firm and major globe manufacturer.  Hultman is negotiating distribution rights to Van Sant's creation, which may be  the biggest thing in globes since the 1950s, when bumps were placed on them to  symbolize mountain chains.  </P> <P> For Van Sant, the project is more than the realization of an artistic dream.  It's a necessity, he says, a potential cure for mankind's predilection for  failing to treat the Earth as a fragile, organism-like entity.  </P> <P> "The Earth is like a person," he says. "You might not appreciate how much you  would be affected if something happened to a small part of you, like your big  toe. But everything is connected, interrelated." An untreated infection in one  small place could imperil the entire organism, he says.  </P> <P> Van Sant says the GeoSphere can make this point forcefully. GeoSphere  technology can go beyond creating what its makers call a "reality image" of the  Earth. The technology has the potential to generate computer pictures of the  Earth, past and future.  </P> <P> Such projections already exist in the form of tables and charts, the dialect of  scientists. The purpose of a three-dimensional globe is to translate scientific  data into a picture that can be understood by policy-makers and ordinary  people.  </P> <P> "If the World Bank is deciding whether to support dam building or a  deforestation project in the Amazon, they are not now able to see all the  ramifications of this decision," Van Sant says.  </P> <P> Ultimately, GeoSphere technology will be able to project "what the Amazon  region looked like in 1972, 1982, and show what it looks like in 1990," Van  Sant says. "With risk projection, we can show what the rain forests will look  like in 2010 given the same rate of deforestation."  </P> <P> "Earth-resource studies and Earth sciences are no longer territory for  scientific inquiry alone," he says. "They are essential ingredients in the  formation of public policy."  </P> <P> It makes perfect sense for an artist to be heading a scientific project with  that goal, Van Sant says. "Artists are tremendously needed in the world of  technology to be able to take these issues and communicate them effectively."  Besides, he says, "I'm comfortable with large things."  </P> <P> Van Sant has crossed between art and science before. In 1980, he placed  sunlight-reflecting mirrors in the Mojave Desert to overexpose picture panels  in a satellite passing overhead. The overexposure created what appeared to be a  drawing of a giant eye, about 2.5 kilometers across, or 100,000 times the size  of a human eye.  </P> <P> And, he's used a stream of electrons to etch a microscopic eye, 100,000 times  smaller than normal, into the side of a salt crystal.  </P> <P> Van Sant, 59, has also produced more traditional art -- paintings, murals and  sculptures -- all across Southern California. The former Marine and Korean War  veteran has supported himself as an artist since earning a master's degree in  fine arts in 1957 from the Otis Art Institute in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Van Sant has accepted virtually no commissions, however, since March, 1989,  when an eye infection after a cornea transplant nearly blinded him.  </P> <P> "The only thing that could save my eyes was the administration of five  different antibiotics in my eyes every half-hour for 10 days," he recalls.  "That's a treatment that made everyone crazy, even the nurses. I emptied my  mind of all thought and resided there for 10 days. When that period was over,  the GeoSphere made a choice on me. Nothing else would reside in my mind."  </P> <P> But single-mindedness was no substitute for technical expertise. That's why Van  Sant called JPL's Van Warren, who had put together a cruder computer-assisted  Earth mosaic on his own.  </P> <P> "I always wanted to see the Earth as it looked from space," Warren says. "We  pay so much attention to other planets, why not pay attention to our own  planet? It is what affects us most of the time."  </P> <P> JPL agreed to release Warren for four months to work with Van Sant, who used  his own money to purchase a $200,000 advanced graphics computer. Overall, the  artist, who lives in a Santa Monica garage apartment with his 8-year-old son,  estimates that he's invested about $350,000 in the project.  </P> <P> For months, the GeoSphere team labored in a dark, creaky, converted garage in  Pasadena. Between them, Van Sant and Warren painstakingly pored over about five  years of satellite data and aerial photography bought or borrowed from  government storage facilities. The goal was to find at least one cloud-free  satellite picture of every section of land and water. From these, Van Sant  could use Warren's computer program to assemble a single mosaic-style picture  of the Earth.  </P> <P> Some areas, such as parts of the Amazon, the Congo and southern New Zealand,  were always covered with clouds. Enter JPL's Jim Knighton, who had purchased  charts and tables, originally compiled by the CIA, describing various rivers  and coastlines. Even before he met Van Sant, Knighton, who has now become the  project's technical director, had been using computer graphics to convert these  data into picture form.  </P> <P> The image remained seriously flawed, however, because the colors -- coded by  scientists concerned with such topics as surface temperature and infrared  radiation -- were wrong. Heavily forested areas, for instance, typically came  out red instead of green. Van Sant says they looked like raw meat.  </P> <P> Leo Blume, another computer-graphics consultant who then worked for JPL,  designed a program to correct the colors.  </P> <P> At every turn, Van Sant could move forward with the mosaic only after his  technical team created a computer medium within which he could work. It was as  if da Vinci had to keep the "Mona Lisa" on hold while his colleagues struggled  to invent the paintbrush.  </P> <P> The image that emerged is not quite a photo, though it looks like one. Surface  features in perpetually cloud-covered areas were traced in through computer  graphics and colored as they would appear. Green areas were made a little  greener, to compensate for natural factors that convert green to a dull brown  when viewed from space. Other surface features, such as rivers, were enhanced  to make them more visible.  </P> <P> The team says its computer image, finished in April, is one of the largest and  most complex ever assembled. It contains well over 37 million pixels. Each  pixel is an individually controlled dot of color that makes up part of the  image. And every pixel had about 15 sets of data behind it.  </P> <P> "Because of its sheer enormity," Warren says, "I did feel at times like a  bricklayer."  </P> <P> The resolution enables Van Sant to show any object on the surface that's four  kilometers -- about 4,400 yards -- or larger, although a person might need a  powerful magnifying glass to see it. Next, Van Sant would like to try for a  one-kilometer resolution, which would require four times the amount of  information and render objects as small as airports distinguishable.  </P> <P> In Van Sant's computer, the Earth appears on a monitor and will turn or rotate  on command. The computer program can zoom in on any designated geographic  location, such as the Nile River. Van Sant eventually hopes JPL's Knighton can  package this software for home computers.  </P> <P> Van Sant says an inexpensive home globe for families and classrooms is also  just around the corner. Ideally, that globe would include a variety of snap-on  accessories, to show political boundaries, for instance.  </P> <P> In the meantime, Van Sant has lined up vendors to sell poster versions of his  GeoSphere image. Just in time, Van Sant says, noting he's come near the end of  his savings and credit. "The universe is looking after us," he said.  </P></p>

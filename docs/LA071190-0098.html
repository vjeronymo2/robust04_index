			<p><P> July 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUGHES, MARTIN MARIETTA SUBMIT THEIR FINAL BIDS FOR FORD'S AEROSPACE UNIT  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft and Martin Marietta have submitted final bids for the Ford  Aerospace subsidiary of Ford Motor Co., defense industry sources said Tuesday.  </P> <P> The bid by Los Angeles-based Hughes Aircraft, a unit of General Motors, was  submitted in conjunction with the French aerospace firm Alcatel, the sources  said.  </P> <P> Alcatel reportedly is seeking to acquire Ford's communications satellite  business in Palo Alto and Hughes the remainder of the Newport Beach-based  aerospace company.  </P> <P> When Ford put its defense unit on the market in early January, it was expected  to fetch as much as $1.5 billion, but industry sources say it may go for as  little as $600 million.  </P> <P> It is another measure of how depressed the defense industry has become, facing  a future of spreading world peace and dwindling defense budgets.  </P> <P> "It's fire-sale time in the defense industry," one knowledgeable source said.  </P> <P> Ford Motor spokesmen Tom Rhoades declined to comment on what companies made  bids or how much they were. He acknowledged only that Ford received bids.  Rhoades said he did not know when a winner will be announced.  </P> <P> Elliot Miller, a spokesman for Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta, said he  could neither confirm nor deny the report that his company was a bidder.  Martin, a major producer of spacecraft and electro-optical systems, was the  nation's eighth-largest defense contractor in 1989.  </P> <P> Hughes Aircraft spokesman Richard Dore also had no comment. General Motors  Corp., which owns Hughes, was the nation's fifth-largest defense contractor  last year.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace's revenue is estimated at $2 billion annually, two-thirds of it  from the defense sector. The company employs about 17,000 around the nation.  Ford Motor was the nation's 28th-largest defense contractor in 1989.  </P> <P> Ford Aerospace's satellite business, which Alcatel wants to acquire, produces  commercial communications satellites, including the most recent generation for  the international communications agency Intelsat. In addition, the Palo Alto  unit builds weather satellites for the Commerce Department's National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration.  </P> <P> A number of foreign firms have acquired U.S. defense contractors, with various  arrangements to protect U.S. defense technology. Since Ford is not a major  producer of military reconnaissance satellites, perhaps the most sensitive such  technology, a purchase by a foreign company might not face insurmountable  obstacles.  </P> <P> In addition to satellites, Ford Aerospace produces tactical missiles in Newport  Beach, conducts support work for the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration in Houston and operates a satellite tracking control center in  Sunnyvale, Calif. Ford also owns BDM, a defense consulting and engineering  organization, which was acquired in 1988 for $425 million.  </P> <P> Industry sources said Ford is a major contractor to the super-secret National  Security Agency, operating telecommunications-intercept posts around the world.  </P> <P> A number of Ford operations would be good fits with Hughes Aircraft operations,  including Ford's tactical missile and electro-optical targeting businesses.  Hughes is suffering a business downturn in both its electro-optical and missile  businesses, and a consolidation with Ford could help both operations, experts  said. But Hughes' primary interest is in Ford's software capabilities, the  industry sources said.  </P> <P> The Ford satellite business would also seem to fit well with Hughes Aircraft's  Space &amp; Communications group, the world's dominant producer of  communications satellites. But knowledgeable sources suggested that Hughes has  little enthusiasm for Ford's satellite operations.  </P> <P> Hughes' decision to try to acquire Ford came as a surprise to some industry  officials, who noted that Hughes has been attempting to diversify out of  defense.  </P> <P> Hughes Chairman Malcolm Currie wants to obtain 40% to 50% of Hughes' revenue  from non-defense operations by the end of this decade.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  answered a question put by KCNA today as regards the recent call  of the French Foreign Ministry for "sanctions" against the DPRK  over its "nuclear problem." He said:    A deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of France  released a provocative "statement" on February 3, claiming that  there had been no success in the DPRK-U.S. talks and it was time  to bring up the issue of taking "sanctions" against the DPRK at  the United Nations Security Council.    At a time when a serious crisis has been created in the  situation of the Korean peninsula by a perfidious act of the  United States, France freely cried for "sanctions" against the  DPRK, though she must know well what such "sanctions" would  mean. This was not aimed at preventing nuclear proliferation  but at finding a pretext for resuming its nuclear tests by  taking issue with the DPRK's "nuclear problem."    Lurking behind this impudent act of France is also her  sinister intention to foil the DPRK-U.S. talks, egg the United  States on to a showdown with the DPRK and cause a military  conflict in the Northeast Asian region including the Korean  peninsula so that it may fish in troubled waters through the  massive sale of weapons of destruction. This is clearly proven  by the fact that France has sold large quantities of weapons to  this region including South Korea in recent years.    It is until some time ago that France sold a big amount of  plutonium to Japan, not joining the nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty [NPT] on the pretext of "modernization of nuclear  deterrent." It is unbecoming to her to express "concern" over  the fate of the NPT now.    It is really the height of sarcasm for France, which  possesses many nuclear weapons and now feels an urge to continue  nuclear tests, to cry for "sanctions" against the DPRK, charging  it with the "nuclear problem".    We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the  France  authorities, ignoring our sincere efforts for a fundamental  solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, are  resorting to bellicose acts against us.    If France persist in such insidious acts without discretion,  we will take necessary measures against them.    France must look squarely at the situation and ponder on the  matter.</p>

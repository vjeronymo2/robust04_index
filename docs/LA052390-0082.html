			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN JUVENILE HALL MASS ESCAPE IS ARRESTED  </P> <P> A teen-age escapee suspected of aiding six violent-crime suspects to flee the  county's Central Juvenile Hall last week by smashing a car through a utility  gate has been arrested, authorities said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Detective Lt. Robert Barker said Barry Mortis, 17, was  arrested on a fugitive warrant Sunday at a house near 61st Street and Vernon  Avenue. Mortis refused to come out of the house at first, but eventually  surrendered without incident, Barker said.  </P> <P> Mortis, who fled Juvenile Hall in March, was linked to one of two cars used in  the jailbreak and knew one of escapees who raced to freedom through the smashed  gate, police said.  </P> <P> After his arrest, Mortis was returned to Juvenile Hall to face an escape  charge, along with allegations of kidnaping, attempted rape and kidnaping for  purposes of robbery, the charges on which he was originally detained.  </P> <P> Concern over the escape -- all six youths are still at large -- brought a call  by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday for a study of the feasibility of  housing violent youthful offenders in maximum-security facilities, instead of  in Juvenile Hall.  </P> <P> "I am very concerned that minors declared unfit and charged with murder and  other violent offenses would be detained in Juvenile Hall to begin with," said  Supervisor Ed Edelman, who called for an investigation of last week's escape.  </P> <P> "The sophisticated and probable preplanning involved in the escape itself  indicates a level of criminal maturity that juvenile halls are just not  equipped to deal with," the supervisor said.  </P> <P> Edelman, in whose district Central Juvenile Hall is located, noted that four of  the fugitives had been detained on murder charges and had been declared "unfit"  for handling by the Juvenile Court, but had been ordered detained in Juvenile  Hall.  </P> <P> Under questioning by Edelman, Chief Probation Officer Barry Nidorf said he has  asked for a review of every file of violent offenders in county juvenile  facilities. According to probation officers, 95 offenders charged with murder  are now housed in the system.  </P> <P> "If they are unfit to stand trial as a juvenile, why do we continue to have  them at Juvenile Hall?" Edelman asked.  </P> <P> "It doesn't make sense to me either. It is because we are ordered by the  court," Nidorf said.  </P> <P> Edelman said, "We can't tolerate any more escapes similar to this."  </P> <P> In Friday's breakout, a 1981 Chevrolet station wagon that had been stolen in  the Mid-Wilshire area was used to crash through a gate on the north side of  Juvenile Hall on Eastlake Avenue in Lincoln Heights.  </P> <P> Police said the six fled in a second car.  </P></p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Money Markets: BoE firms policy EXPECTATIONS of a near-term cut in official interest rates in both Britain and Germany faded yesterday after the Bank of England and the Bundesbank signalled that credit policy would remain tight, writes James Blitz. Until yesterday, there had been strong speculation that the Bundesbank would ease official rates this week, because of easier operations the German money market. The expectation was dampened by yesterday's monthly report from the Bundesbank. The December Euromark contract fell 12 basis points on publication of the Bundesbank report, closing at 91.64, and the December French franc contract fell 13 basis point to close at 90.35. In London, discount house traders said that the Bank of England emphasised in its money market operations that there will be no near-term cut in UK base rates. On Tuesday, the Bank turned down cheaper offers for shorter dated bills, buying small denominations of bills at established rates. Yesterday, they may have underlined that policy was on hold by offering a repurchase agreement that expires on 9 November. One discount house dealer felt that the Bank was signalling 'no change' by asking dealers to tie up funds over 26 days at the established rate of 8 15/16 per cent. However, some dealers felt that the government could be forced into a base rate cut by growing pressures in the real economy. Official figures showed yesterday that Britain's overall industrial output slid 0.3 per cent in August after a 1 per cent rise in July. The predominance of that view was reflected in an unchanged close for 3-month money, at a rounded 8 5/8 per cent, and only a 2 basis point drop in the December short sterling contract to 91.88. However, the overnight rate shot up to 20 per cent because of large shortages among commercial banks. The daily shortage was Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 50m in the 'repo,' followed by Pounds 2m of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 4m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 15m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and another Pounds 157m in the 'repo.' In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 3m of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 571m of Band 1 bank bills and Pounds 22m of Band 2 bank bills, providing Pounds 485m of late assistance.</p>

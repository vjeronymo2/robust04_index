			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Liffe fines options trader Pounds 25,000 THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has fined Mr Giles Robinson, an options trader formerly registered with Refco Overseas, a total of Pounds 25,000 for breaching Liffe rules. The exchange also revoked his registration as a trader. Mr Robinson was found by Liffe to have manipulated certain transactions in March 1991 by abusing trading priority. Although it was accepted that Refco had no knowledge of the rule breaches, the firm was fined Pounds 56,500 as member firms are held responsible for their employees' conduct.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Mollemann quits FDP post Mr Jurgen Mollemann, chief rival to Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister and head of the Free Democrats (FDP), yesterday resigned from his party post in protest against being excluded from coalition talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Mr Mollemann, who went so far as to blame Mr Kinkel for the FDP's poor showing in the recent federal elections, quit as party leader in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. The FDP saw its share of the vote reduced from 11 per cent in 1990 to 6.9 per cent two weeks ago. Officials in Bonn said Mr Mollemann's resignation was unlikely to heal the policy rifts in the FDP. The party is sharply divided between those who want a return to libertarian values and greater deregulation of the market, and those who have compromised the party's old traditions in favour of remaining as a junior partner in Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic-led coalition. The future strategy of the party will be debated at a special meeting in December. Mr Mollemann, a former economics minister who was forced to resign his cabinet post in late 1992 for abuse of office, would not discuss his future plans.</p>

			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Rebel wife faces poll ban Peru's national electoral board has disqualified the new party of Ms Susana Higuchi, President Alberto Fujimori's estranged wife, from fielding candidates in next April's presidential elections. If the decision is upheld, it will end Ms Higuchi's ambitions of unseating her husband. Since August the presidential couple have been engaged in a bitter feud. Ms Higuchi first attacked her husband's policies, and then moved out of the presidential palace and renounced her role as First Lady to pursue her own political ambitions. Under Peruvian law, newly formed parties must present evidence of at least 100,000 supporters. According to the electoral board, fewer than 12,000 of the 147,000 signatures presented by Harmony 21st Century, Ms Higuchi's party, were valid. Ms Higuchi said she would appeal against the board's decision. She has blamed its computer system for the rejection of her supporters. Many of them, she said, were women who had signed with their husband's surnames, which technically invalidated them. She has also called for a march in support of her party today. Earlier this week, Ms Higuchi accused Peru's national intelligence service of attempting to quash her candidacy through 'high-tech fraud'. She claimed 150,000 signatures had been erased from her party's computers during a Lima power black-out which affected only the block where her campaign offices are located. It is not clear whether Ms Higuchi can appeal against the board's decision. In previous elections, candidates were given leeway to rectify technical errors and come up with the number of valid signatures required. But even if she clears this obstacle, Ms Higuchi faces another. A law passed in July prohibits close relatives of the serving president from standing for office. Ms Higuchi has already complained to the Organisation of American States that this law is a violation of the constitutional right of any Peruvian over the age of 35 to stand for office.</p>

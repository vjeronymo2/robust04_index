			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 4 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam's  office may strengthen the government's overall policy  coordination as senior administration officials continue to  contradict one another on the North Korean nuclear dispute and  other foreign and national security issues. As part of the plan  reported Monday, the presidential office would either form a  consultative body comprising Chongwadae, the National  Unification Board, the foreign and defense ministries and the  Agency for National Security Planning, or beef up Chongwadae's  team on foreign and national security affairs.    One Chongwadae official acknowledged Monday that confusion  has emerged in the government's foreign and security policy  "because of Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu's attitude, Ambassador  to China Hwang Pyong-tae's recent remarks and Vice Foreign  Minister Hong Sun-yong's publicly expressed opinion" over the  weekend.    "Chongwadae is undertaking a study from various angles in  order to strengthen the coordinating function of its foreign and  security policy," the official said, requesting anonymity.    The consultative body is being considered because of the  limitations of the current system including conferences of  security-related ministers, chaired by the president, and the  prime minister's strategic sessions with high government  officials. But the new body would not be like the United  States' National Security Council (NSC) since the present  security-related ministers' meetings perform a similar function,  he said.    Alternatively, Chongwadae may beef up the office of the  senior presidential secretary for foreign and national security  affairs since it is the president who makes the final decision  on all foreign and security policy, he said.    Another Chongwadae official said, "following Ambassador  Hwang's inappropriate remarks, our foreign policy was once again  plunged into confusion when Vice Foreign Minister Hong suggested  on Sunday that the government should consider dropping its  demand for a special envoy exchange with North Korea as a  precondition for a third round of U.S.-North Korean high-level  talks."    "It has become an urgent government task to strengthen  policy  coordination if we are to establish an effective North Korea  strategy," the official said.    "The weakest point in our foreign policy in the past started  with showing all our cards," the official pointed out.  Henceforth, the government will keep secret its negotiating  strategy while beefing up the publicity function, he said.</p>

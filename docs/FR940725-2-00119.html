The Company is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of the state of New York. The Company is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Allianz Life Insurance Company of North America (``Allianz''). Allianz is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Minnesota. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Variable Account is a segregated investment account of the Company and is registered under the 1940 Act as a unit investment trust. The Variable Account was established to fund certain variable annuity contracts (``Contracts'') issued by the Company. The Variable Account is subdivided into sub-accounts, each of which invests in a fund of the Franklin Valuemark Funds, a Massachusetts business trust registered under the 1940 ``Act'' as a diversified open-end management investment company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. NALAC Financial Plans, Inc., a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, is the distributor of the Contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Contracts are individual flexible payment deferred variable annuity contracts (``Deferred Contracts'') or individual immediate variable annuity contracts (``Immediate Contracts''). The Contracts are available in connection with retirement plans that qualify for Federal tax advantages and for plans that do not so qualify. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. The Contracts provide for certain charges. Any premium taxes or other taxes payable to a state or other governmental entity will be charged against the Contract values. The Company may, in its sole discretion, pay taxes when due and deduct that amount from the Contract at a later date. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Owners of Deferred Contracts may transfer all or a part of their interest in a sub-account to another sub-account. The Company reserves the right to charge, per transfer, the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount transferred. Prior to the date annuity payments begin (``Annuity Date''), there is no charge for the first three transfers per Contract year. Currently, the Company permits twelve transfers per Contract year without a transfer fee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Owners of Immediate Contracts may transfer all or part of their interest in a sub-account to another sub-account without the imposition of any transfer fee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. For Deferred Contracts, the Company will deduct an annual contract maintenance charge of $30. Applicants represent that this charge has not been set at a level greater than actual cost and contains no element of profit. There is no contract maintenance charge for Immediate Contracts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The Company deducts an administrative expense charge that is equal on an annual basis to .15% of the average daily net assets of the Variable Account. This charge, together with the contract maintenance charge, is designed to reimburse the Company for the expenses it incurs in the establishment and maintenance of the Contracts and the Variable Account. The Company does not intend to profit from this charge. Should this charge be insufficient, the Company will not increase this charge and will incur the loss. Applicants rely on Rule 26a&hyph;1 to deduct the contract maintenance charge and the administrative expense charge. Applicants represent that the administrative expense charge will be reduced in the future to the extent that the amount of this charge is in excess of that necessary to reimburse the Company for its administrative expenses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jozo Curic] </F>   [Text] Washington--The Croatian-U.S. meeting ended late  this afternoon, Central European time. Foreign Minister Mate  Granic, President Zubak [of the presidential council of  Herceg-Bosna], and Minister Akmadzic talked to Clinton's special  envoy Redman, Warren Christopher's assistant Oxman, and  Ambassadors Galbraith and Jakovich. Then the Bosnian side met  the Americans. They talked about the models of organizing a new  Bosnia-Herzegovina in future confederal links between Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Following consultations with President Tudjman, the Croatian  side presented its hosts with new proposals. As we have learned  from sources close to the State Department, at the meeting the  Croatian representatives insisted on full protection for the  rights of the Croat people in Bosnia-Herzegovina. This, the  Croatians believe, is the most essential element of the  agreement.    Two models are being studied behind closed doors in the  State  Department. According to one, the two republics would be linked  up in a federal state of Bosnia-Herzegovina, while the other  envisages the creation of cantons some of which would be  predominantly Croat while the others would be predominantly  Bosnian. Every canton would have its inherent [izvorni]  sovereignty and authority. This authority would then be vested  in the federal state of Bosnia- Herzegovina.    Observers stress that these cantons would be organized in  two  unions, a union of Croat cantons and a union of Bosnian cantons.  There are reports that Croat cantons might include  municipalities with a majority Muslim population while Muslim  cantons might include municipalities with a majority Croat  population. Mechanisms of mutual protection for members of the  Croat and the Muslim people in these municipalities, each of  which would be linked to its own union of cantons, were also  discussed. According to some reports, there is a possibility of  dividing powers between federal bodies -- that is, president,  bicameral parliament, government, and constitutional court --  and intercantonal bodies.    Minister Granic told reporters outside the State Department  that the talks will continue and that further details will be  known late this evening, Central European time, or even later.  The two delegations and their hosts agreed that no details  about the talks should be disclosed. Asked about the atmosphere  at the meeting and whether any side had ruled out the  possibility of reaching agreement, Granic told Croatian  television: There is a working atmosphere at the meeting. No  one has ruled out agreement although there still remain open  issues.    Observers in Washington have learned that the confederal  model between Croatia and a new Bosnia-Herzegovina was discussed  for the first time today. For the time being any details are  regarded as secret. The United States intends to draw up its  own text on the basis of the Croatian and Muslim proposal. Also  mentioned were a monetary and customs union and an economic and  defense agreement between Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Central Bosnia was also discussed as well as protective  mechanisms for the Croats there. There are also a number of  options and models of involving the Serbs.    As we file this report intensive consultations are still in  progress. The hosts are sticking to the principle of talking  separately to the Croatian and Bosnian representatives.</p>

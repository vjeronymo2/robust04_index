			<p><P> July 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GROUP GAINS IN FIGHT ON BILLBOARDS  </P> <P> In its first attempt to flex its political muscle, the Crescenta Valley Town  Council has won a step in its battle to ban all new billboards in the  semi-rural community.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission voted unanimously last week  to recommend establishment of a billboard exclusion zone in La Crescenta and  Montrose, an isolated, unincorporated island of county territory sandwiched  between Glendale and La Canada Flintridge.  </P> <P> The action recommends that the County Board of Supervisors permanently prohibit  construction of any new billboards in the La Crescenta area. Action by  supervisors is expected in about a month.  </P> <P> The billboard issue was the first undertaken by the nine-member advisory  council, formed 16 months ago by residents in a grass-roots effort to gain  greater say over their community. The council has no direct legislative power  but acts as an adviser to County Supervisor Mike Antonovich.  </P> <P> Residents had complained that giant billboards along Foothill and Oceanview  boulevards, the main commercial strips, create a visual blight in the hillside  community. Most of the billboards have cropped up in recent years.  </P> <P> The proposed exclusion zone would prohibit all new signs. Existing signs could  stay indefinitely, but could not be replaced or moved.  </P></p>

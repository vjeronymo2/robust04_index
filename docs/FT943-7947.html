			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): BASF first-half results disappoint the optimists With the Bundesbank unwilling to move, bourses lacked the additional impetus on key rates that some analysts expected, but there was a stream of major corporate results to keep interest alive, FRANKFURT weakened from a Dax high of 2,161.37 before the Buba announcement to close 8.73 lower at 2,153.56, easing a fraction more after hours to close the afternoon at an Ibis-indicated 2,151.44. Turnover fell from DM7.8bn to DM5.9bn. Progress reports came from Volkswagen, in the automotive sector, and from BASF, Henkel and Gehe, the last three all broadly in or around the German chemical industry. A 41 per cent rise to DM683m in BASF's half-year pre-tax profits came in below most analysts' forecasts, which ranged from DM700m to well above DM1bn. This left the shares DM3.20 lower at DM326.50, with a further fall to DM324.10 after hours. The other members of the 'big three' chemicals trio, Bayer and Hoechst, are due to report next week. Bayer, the least cyclical of the three and less favoured in the pre-results excitement of recent weeks, fell only DM1.70 to DM368.20 at the end of the day; but Hoechst, burdened with short- term gains after the recent tale that it could turn ozone into oxygen, fell DM6 to DM351. Mr Martin Glen at Lehman Brothers said BASF had restructuring and its own particular attribute, a line for 'other expenses', before it came to the pre-tax level. Given the unpredictability of this effect the BASF figures, he added, would not alter his forecasts of bumper results from Bayer and Hoechst next week. Volkswagen slipped in spite of forecasting a break-even for the full year, dropping DM4.50 to DM508.50; Henkel reported an increase of more than 10 per cent in first-half profits and fell DM9 to DM585 late in the day; but Gehe, in the recently embattled pharmaceuticals sector, forecast a rise in pre-tax profits this year from DM193m to DM250m, and left its shares DM7 stronger at DM595. PARIS finished 1.2 per cent down under pressure from the bond market and the weaker dollar. The CAC-40 index declined 24.44 to 2,010.54 in turnover of FFr2.5bn. Pinault-Printemps dipped FFr9 to FFr920 on news that it was acquiring a 66.6 per cent stake in the FNAC retail chain, following an agreement with the minority shareholder Generale des Eaux, down FFr7 at FFr536. Euro-Disney slipped 25 centimes to FFr10.35 after announcing that the finance director was to leave the group following the completion of its restructuring programme. AMSTERDAM moved lower as a further batch of corporate results disappointed investors, while scant attention was given to the formation of the new government, which was expected to be sworn in formally on Monday. The AEX index slipped 3.63 to 414.17. Van Ommeren, the Rotterdam-based transport and storage group, fell back after announcing lower than expected first-half results, closing off Fl 2.40 at Fl 53.30. The company announced a first-half net profit of Fl 24.1m, against analysts' expectations of between Fl 23m and Fl 30m. Fokker closed unchanged at Fl 16.80 ahead of its first-half results, showing a drop of 54 per cent over the same year-ago period, which came in after the close. The aircraft manufacturer commented that in spite of the first-half figures, it expected results for the full year to show an improvement on an annual basis. Among second-tier stocks, Getronics, the computer services company, moved Fl 2.20 higher to Fl 51.90 after pleas-ing the market with a 19 per cent increase in first-half profits. MILAN greeted the first day of the new account with a slight loss, and brokers remarked that trading activity continued to be downbeat in light of the political problems overhanging the market. The Comit index receded 4.39 to 644.83. At the start of its capital increase, BCI fell an effective 1.2 per cent to L3,550 as its L2,300bn rights issue, priced at L3,000, came on stream. The capital increase programme, which aims to raise some L2,360bn, is due to run for the length of the September account. Telecom Italia made its debut on the market yesterday - it replaced the quotation for Sip - and the shares closed at L4,190, up L75. ZURICH had an unhappy day, depressed by a fall in German bund futures, the weak dollar and a continued hammering, said Mr Frederick Hasslauer at Bank Sal Oppenheim, for domestic bank shares after the shock of the SBC results. The SMI index fell 15.8 to 2,583.5. In the banking sector, SBC lost another SFr7 at SFr371 and UBS fell SFr8 to SFr1,114. In industrials, Brown Boveri tumbled SFr30 to SFr1,215 on further profit-taking after good first-half results from its Swedish/Swiss parent group ABB. STOCKHOLM rallied, supported by good half-year results from Ericsson and a sharp decline in Swedish bond yields. The Affarsvarlden General index moved forward 7.90 to 1,413.90. Ericsson's 78 per cent jump in half-year pre-tax profits was but a prediction of continued strong growth in new orders and left the 'B' shares SKr16 higher at SKr418; the big telecoms group's performance in the New York market later suggested that there might be scope for a further rise today. In this, more elevated, atmosphere Brown Boveri's Swedish partner, Asea, declined only SKr2 to SKr614. COPENHAGEN had its own banking shock as Den Danske Bank, Denmark's largest banking group, reported an 85 per cent drop in pre-tax profits due to large losses on securities trading. DDB fell DKr7 to DKr336, its rival Unidanmark, due to report next week, by DKr4 to DKr228, and the KFX index by 1.12 to 110.56. MADRID featured some individual gains, including a Pta150 rise to Pta11,950 in Bankinter, but most banks and the market were unhappy under pressure from weakness in the bond futures market, and the Madrid General index closed 2.59 lower at 307.08 in thin turnover of Pta21.74bn. ATHENS fell 2.25 per cent to close below the support level of 880 as investors took profits, especially in the construction sector. The general index lost 20.19 at 876.18. Turnover was Dr4.58bn in volume of 1.7m shares. Losers led gainers by 142 to 19, with 20 issues unchanged.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Most of the Nigerian newspapers today report the  formation of a new pressure group known as the National  Democratic Coalition, NADECO, by a group of eminent Nigerian  politicians, retired military officers, human rights activists,  and business executives. The papers say the new group is  opposed to the planned constitutional conference by the present  military regime in Nigeria. The papers, CHAMPION, GUARDIAN,  VANGUARD, and the NATIONAL CONCORD, report the story differently.    Ajasin, Ukiwe, Others Oppose Parley: that is the CHAMPION.  The paper reports that Nigeria's second in command in the early  days of the former administration of General Babangida, Retired  Navy Commodore Ebitu Ukiwe; a former civilian governor of Ondo  State, Chief Adekunle Ajasin; and Malam (Lawan Dimbazo) have  spoken against the holding of the constitutional conference  scheduled to begin next month. According to the paper, they  launched their opposition to the conference at the weekend  because they felt the conference was ill-conceived and would  only amount to a waste of public funds since nothing concrete  will come out of it. The paper says the three were speaking  under the aegis of the newly formed National Democratic  Coalition, NADECO.    THE PUNCH and THE GUARDIAN say the National Democratic  Coalition, NADECO, has urged Nigerians to boycott the proposed  constitutional conference. The papers say NADECO, a pressure  group in nature, has also urged the present military government  in Nigeria to shelve the planned conference. According to the  papers, NADECO has described the conference as a ruse and [word  indistinct] intended to perpetuate military dictatorship in  Nigeria.    VANGUARD and CONCORD report that the group has given the  military regime in Nigeria an ultimatum to make way for Chief  M.K.O. Abiola who allegedly won the June 1993 annulled  presidential election. The papers say NADECO has given the  military up to 31 May to call on Chief Abiola to form a  broad-based government.    Military Blamed For Crisis: THE REPUBLIC. The paper reports  that a pressure group known as the Campaign for Democracy [CD]  has blamed what it calls the current crisis of confidence in  Nigeria on the military class. REPUBLIC quotes a communique  issued by the Kogi State wing of the CD as saying that for  Nigeria to successfully move out from such crisis of confidence,  it will require genuine political education of its citizenry.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (25): East Devon targets the Philippines - Case study, Asian business partnership / An unlikely venture launched from a Georgian country house hotel In the unlikely setting of a Georgian country house hotel, on the banks of the river Otter in east Devon, an export drive has been launched on the Philippines. It is a slightly improbable venture by the local business community. East Devon is a rural part of south-west England. Agriculture and tourism are leading industries; the largest town, Exmouth, has a population of 30,000. The Range Rovers and tractors in the region's green lanes are a world away from the exotic customised Jeepneys in the streets of Manila. Manufacturing accounts for only 16 per cent of the east Devon workforce and, with a mere handful of local companies employing more than 200 people, south-east Asia has hardly featured as an export market. The initiative, however, is serious. It is supported by East Devon district council and the local enterprise agency while Mr Jesus Tambunting, the Philippines' ambassador to the UK, is encouraging business links. Although it is premature to judge the value of the venture, the first contacts by Devon companies are being made. The instigator is Mr Mike Connell, a London-born businessman who worked for two decades in the Philippines as the Pacific Rim regional director of an American welding group. He returned to England in the mid-1980s and has settled in east Devon with his Filipino wife and four sons. During the recession, he found local businessmen complaining of the difficulty of exporting to continental Europe but unaware of the possibilities of the huge south-east Asian market. In particular, they did not realise that English was spoken in the Philippines which meant, for example, that sales literature did not need to be translated. 'People here didn't understand the east,' he says. 'Very few could tell me about the countries, and they were worried about the languages, distance and cost,' he says. 'I thought one could short-circuit this by offering a service to any company to help them to get into the market.' Last year, he set up a small consultancy and agency with the grandiose name of Global Exports, but concentrating on the Philippines as a gateway to south-east Asia. 'What has disturbed me with the Department of Trade &amp; Industry is the lack of understanding of what small industry needs. The people in the DTI are good people and well-trained, but the gap is that there is no one who knows how to get out into the market place.' He contacted the local enterprise agency, East Devon Small Industries Group  -'we discussed how to get the message across to people, and as a first step decided to hold a seminar last March.' The Conservative-controlled East Devon district council backed the campaign and Devon &amp; Cornwall training and enterprise council financed the seminar at the Deer Park Hotel, set in 25 acres of parkland near Honiton. As a result, Mr Connell flew to Manila with instructions to represent seven businesses, ranging from a language school to two engineering companies - 'I decided to concentrate on joint ventures. In Asia, what they desperately need is knowhow - they don't need us to stick things in a container and ship it out to them.' He met with President Fidel Ramos and capitalised on the fact that 'I'm on first-name terms with most of the ministers involved in exports.' He is optimistic that orders or agreements will materialise for most or all of his clients. The next step was an official visit to east Devon in July by the ambassador and vice-consul, which included a briefing by them for over 100 business people at the Deer Park Hotel and a dinner hosted by the council. Mr Tambunting told the Devonians there were three good reasons for moving into or doing business with the Philippines: 'The strategic location, the relatively low-cost of living, and the presence of a highly educated, hard-working and English-speaking labour force.' The country, he said, wanted to lessen its own export reliance on the American and Japanese markets. Mr Geoffrey Hulley, director of East Devon Small Industries Group, believes Devon companies should take advantage of the encouragement by the Philippine government. He sees it as 'a marvellous opportunity for small businesses here to get a foothold.' How firm a foothold has yet to be seen. One of the companies represented in Manila by Mr Connell was Sheerspeed UK, an independent company employing eight people making industrial modular shelters and work tents. Mr Maurice Smith, chairman and managing director, says: 'There are a couple of companies willing to distribute our products there, although there is nothing concrete as yet, but we're always hopeful. The idea is to sell there first with the ultimate aim that our products would then be manufactured under licence.' Another company is Cardew Designs, which makes handmade collectable teapots and has grown rapidly to a turnover of Pounds 3m a year. It already exports 60 per cent of its products including to the Pacific Rim, though not to the Philippines. Mr Peter Kirvan, partner of Cardew Designs, says he is appreciative of the efforts and enthusiasm but also sceptical. 'I question whether the Philippines warrants the effort being put into it relative to other markets such as the US,' he says.' I sometimes think the priorities are a little skewed. Shouldn't we be looking at the best potential target and focusing it that way?' Meanwhile, funding is likely to be sought for a trade mission to Manila. Mr Bernard Hughes, chairman of East Devon council's economy and employment committee, sees the campaign as an imaginative way in which businesses can find new markets - 'it's all about promoting and creating the climate in which small firms can prosper,' he says. 'When Mike Connell came to us with his expertise and the enterprise agency as a partnership, we were more than delighted to be part of it. We seem to be getting it right. It comes down to personalities and enthusiasm.'</p>

			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVY WILL FIX FENCE ON U.S.-MEXICO LINE;  </P> <P> BORDER: THE WORK IS AIMED AT DRUG TRAFFICKING, WITH SLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION  AS A SECOND GOAL. THE EXISTING BARRIER HAS MANY OPENINGS.  </P> <P> The U.S.-Mexico border fence -- sagging, full of holes and missing altogether  in some spots -- is due for a face lift, courtesy of U.S. Navy Seabees.  </P> <P> Construction units based at the Naval Amphibious Base, Coronado, will be  deployed soon along the border in San Diego, authorities said. Their mission:  To shore up the fence crossed daily by hundreds of undocumented immigrants  heading north.  </P> <P> They will join California National Guard units that are improving border-area  roads to assist enforcement by U.S. border guards.  </P> <P> Both military efforts are aimed primarily at reducing drug smuggling, but U.S.  immigration authorities say the bolstered fence and improved roadways also will  deter undocumented border crossers.  </P> <P> The existing fence poses little barrier to smugglers and immigrants. A  chain-link fence stretches about seven miles east from the Pacific Ocean. Some  sections have been ripped out or pounded to the ground. A raised braided cable  -- designed as a barrier to vehicular traffic -- marks much of an additional  eight miles of border, but the cable is in disrepair and there are numerous  gaps.  </P> <P> Immigrant-rights advocates have questioned whether a so-called "Tortilla  Curtain," fixed or not, will turn back people fleeing poverty and war.  </P> <P> The Navy presence is the Pentagon's latest foray into the nation's anti-drug  offensive. U.S. armed forces are increasingly providing support to civilian law  enforcement, a trend that has broad support in Congress but has troubled many  civil libertarians.  </P> <P> The Seabees, according to congressional officials, will place heavy-duty metal  panels -- designed for use as mats on provisional aircraft landing fields -- as  reinforcement along the existing barrier.  </P> <P> The U.S. Border Patrol, which maintains the barrier, has been using the surplus  landing-pad material for more than a year in the San Diego area. Authorities  say it has met with some success: No one has cut through it, although many have  climbed over it and some have dug under.  </P> <P> "They certainly haven't been driving through it," said Ted Swofford, Border  Patrol supervisory agent in San Diego, the busiest zone along the almost  2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border.  </P> <P> So-called "drive throughs" long have been a problem in the border zone,  particularly in the flat grasslands of the Otay Mesa area. A U.S. plan to dig a  ditch in that area was withdrawn last year after critics likened it to a new  Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> The Seabee unit -- known officially as Amphibious Construction Battalion 1 --  likely will be deployed within the week, possibly by Friday, said U.S. Rep.  Duncan L. Hunter (R-Coronado), who has pushed for greater use of the military  in anti-drug border efforts. His district includes the entire 150-mile boundary  area.  </P> <P> "The fence along the border is in rags," Hunter said in a statement.  </P> <P> The Seabee unit and the Border Patrol will determine whether the troops will be  armed, said Col. James Sutherland, a spokesman for Joint Task Force 6, the El  Paso-based Pentagon arm that coordinates military involvement in anti-drug  efforts along the southwest border.  </P></p>

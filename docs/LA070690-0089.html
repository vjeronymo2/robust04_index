			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 5 PARIS MUSEUMS CLOSE AFTER ROUND OF PAINTING THEFTS;  </P> <P> ART: OFFICIALS ARE TIGHTENING SECURITY. INVESTIGATORS SAY IT IS POSSIBLE ALL  THREE CRIMES WERE COMMITTED BY THE SAME PERSON OR GROUP.  </P> <P> Five Paris art museums closed their doors to individual visitors Thursday after  paintings were stolen from three museums -- including a Renoir cut out of its  frame at the Louvre -- over a span of several hours.  </P> <P> Jacques Sallois, director of national museums, said security would be tightened  at the city's major museums, which remained open. Authorities plan to examine  existing security systems and develop new ones similar to those used in banks.  </P> <P> The museums closed to individuals are relatively small and focus on the works  or the collections of a particular individual: the Eugene Delacroix, Gustave  Moreau, Jean-Jacques Henner, Hebert and Ennery museums.  </P> <P> From now on, group visits to these museums must be arranged in advance, Sallois  said.  </P> <P> Police have complained previously that museum officials were not aggressive  enough or candid enough in dealing with security. Sallois, who took up his post  only five weeks ago, vowed this would change, and said art theft would no  longer be a "taboo subject" for public discussion.  </P> <P> Sallois' unprecedented announcement came shortly after police said that a third  museum had suffered a theft during the short time span Wednesday.  </P> <P> The security risk had been heightened because of a huge increase in visitors to  French museums following a 10-year government drive to improve facilities and  provide more space, Sallois said.  </P> <P> "The flow of visitors is causing problems," he said. "The rise in prices on the  art market is an additional factor. All of this means we must take a new look  at security in museums."  </P> <P> Sallois said he would meet museum directors and their security chiefs in the  next few days and hoped to appoint a security chief for the entire sector soon.  He said there was no evidence of negligence on the part of museum guards,  however, and expressed confidence in the staff.  </P> <P> Police said it was possible all three thefts were committed by the same person  or group, moving across the city center from one museum to another.  </P> <P> According to investigators, the theft revealed on Thursday apparently was the  first to occur in the series.  </P> <P> An 1816 work by French landscape painter Paul Huet was lifted off its hook  Wednesday morning at the Carnavalet Museum, a historical museum in one of the  oldest sections of Paris. "Les Moulins de la Glaciere" was estimated to be  worth about $14,500.  </P> <P> The other two stolen paintings were cut from their frames -- Renoir's "Portrait  of a Seated Woman" from the Louvre and Ernest Hebert's "Portrait of Monaluccia"  from the museum named after the artist.  </P> <P> Both were small-format paintings, a type often chosen by thieves because they  can be easily concealed.  </P> <P> "Portrait of a Seated Woman" (1890-1895) is 13 1/2 by 10 1/2 inches. Hebert's  work, painted about 1870, is 14 by 12 inches.  </P> <P> The theft of the Renoir was discovered about 2:15 p.m., officials said. The  Hebert was discovered missing about an hour later.  </P> <P> All three victimized museums are run by the government.  </P> <P> Officials gave no estimates of the value of the Renoir and Hebert. Independent  experts suggested a possible value of $300,000 to $600,000 for the Renoir.  </P> <P> but said it was impossible to give a precise valuation and noted that Renoir  had done scores of portraits of women in his later years.  </P> <P> Louvre director Michel Laclotte said the theft of "Portrait of a Seated Woman"  appeared to be the work of an "especially clever" professional.  </P> <P> "The canvas was very thin, the cutting instrument was probably extremely sharp  and caused so few vibrations that the electronic sensor did not pick them up,"  he said.  </P> <P> Laclotte led reporters to where the portrait had been hanging -- an isolated  stairwell leading to the Denon Gallery, on the top floor of the Pavillon de  Fleurs overlooking the Seine.  </P> <P> Head painting curator Pierre Rosenberg said the Renoir had been on display in  the stairwell for several years, due to renovations in other sections of the  museum, once a royal palace. It was donated to the Louvre in 1961 by French  collector Victor Lion.  </P> <P> Rosenberg said Renoir was a "magic name" among art lovers, which could explain  the theft, the first at the Louvre in more than 10 years.  </P></p>

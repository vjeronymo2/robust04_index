			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI Is With You Again"] </F>   [Text] Our newspaper did not come out from 25 to 29  January. This was an enforced break. And although the  journalists of ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI are not at fault, we apologize  to our readers for the information loss that it caused them.    But here is what happened. The editorial office introduced a  favorable subscription for them, taking into account the high  price of the subscription to a state newspaper and desiring to  assist citizens who are oriented on receiving accurate and  truthful information at first hand. The creditor did not  transfer money to the newspaper in time to pay for printing  services, dispatching the publication, and payment for paper.    It is difficult not to associate this kind of "selective  approach" with the fact that the ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI journalistic  collective itself decided at the end of last year to become the  founder of its own newspaper, breaking off relations with the  government, which was not fulfilling its duties as the founder.    The policy of the government and the establishment of  Russian  statehood nevertheless remain one of the main themes of our  newspaper, but we can now elucidate it more accurately and  objectively, but, above all, from the aspect with which  important policy is turned to the individual and his daily needs  and interests.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI is with you once again, dear reader. You,  too, stick with us!</p>

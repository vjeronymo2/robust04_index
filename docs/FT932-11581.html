			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / German opposition in disarray as leader resigns GERMANY'S opposition Social Democrats, the main challengers to the rule of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, were thrown into disarray yesterday by the sudden resignation of their leader, Mr Bjorn Engholm. His decision to quit as party leader and as premier of Schleswig-Holstein, ostensibly for misleading a parliamentary inquiry in his home state, leaves the party adrift less than a year before the start of a series of 19 local, state, national and European elections. Mr Engholm announced his move at an emotional press conference, after he had admitted lying about his inside knowledge of a 'dirty tricks' campaign against him by the rival Christian Democrats in Schleswig-Holstein in 1987. He said the affair had damaged his political credibility, without which he could lead neither his state nor the SPD. He remains one of the most popular politicians in the country, alongside Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister, and Mr Wolfgang Schauble, parliamentary leader of the CDU. The SPD announced that Mr Johannes Rau, its most senior vice-chairman, prime minister of North Rhine-Westphalia and the party's challenger to Mr Kohl in 1987, would take over as leader until a new party chief could be elected. Leading candidates include Mr Gerhard Schroder, prime minister of Lower Saxony, and Mr Rudolf Scharping, prime minister in the Rhineland Palatinate. However, Mr Schroder is blamed for harming Mr Engholm in recent weeks by allowing his own ambitions to be known. Mr Rau admitted that the affair was 'a heavy blow' for the Social Democrats, who have been struggling to gain a clear political lead in spite of the current sharp economic recession and squabbling within the ruling coalition. Political observers in Bonn remain baffled at Mr Engholm's decision to quit for lying about the precise moment at which he knew of the dirty tricks campaign being conducted against him by Mr Uwe Barschel, the CDU premier in Schleswig-Holstein. The question was whether he knew before the polling day, or only afterwards. Mr Barschel's press spokesman revealed at the time that he had co-ordinated a series of smear stories against Mr Engholm. As a result of the revelations, the elections were rerun, with victory for the SPD, and Mr Barschel was found dead in a hotel bathroom in Geneva, having apparently committed suicide. In recent weeks, it has emerged that Mr Barschel's press spokesman had received DM40,000 (Dollars 25,000) from one of Mr Engholm's closest aides, in apparent payment for information about the dirty tricks campaign.

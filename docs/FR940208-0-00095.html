			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The majority of the lands within the Gold Butte-Pakoon and Beaver Dam Slope CHUs in Arizona are managed by the BLM under the Arizona Strip Management Plan. This plan designates the Beaver Dam Slope ACEC and includes management prescriptions designed to minimize impacts to desert tortoises and their habitat. All desert tortoise habitat in Arizona is within the area managed by the Virgin River-Pakoon Basin Habitat Management Plan, a cooperative Sikes Act document written by the BLM and the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Additionally, desert tortoise habitat occurring in wilderness areas in Arizona is managed according to the Paiute-Beaver Dam Wilderness Management Plan and the Grand Wash Cliffs Wilderness Management Plan. Grazing is administered according to the Cedar Wash, Highway, Beaver Dam Slope, Mormon Well, Littlefield Community, Mesquite Community, Mosby-Nay, Pakoon Springs, Pakoon, Cottonwood, Mud and Cane, and Tassi Allotment Management Plans. In addition to prescriptions set forth in these allotment management plans, a Service biological opinion on livestock grazing limited grazing to the period from June 1 to March 15.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In Utah, the Beaver Dam Slope CHU is primarily managed by the BLM. In the Castle Cliffs allotment, a 3,040-acre exclosure encompassing the historic Woodbury-Hardy study area and several other important tortoise shelter site areas was established to serve as a natural study area to enhance the tortoise population. However, the exclosure was never completely operational or effective in eliminating grazing in the area. The BLM reduced the exclosure to 1,500 acres, where grazing was completely excluded. The Dixie Resource Area developed a resource management plan for the area, but the final document was rejected and the process has been reinitiated. Currently, BLM management in the Beaver Dam Slope CHU is conducted under the Habitat Management Plan adopted in 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The BLM and the State of Utah are the primary managers of the Upper Virgin River CHU. Smaller amounts of habitat are owned by private entities and by the Paiute Indians. Several consultations have been initiated regarding grazing, housing development, horse racing, and energy pipeline developments, for which the Service has prepared draft biological opinions. Also, Washington County is pursuing development of a habitat conservation plan for the area encompassing the Upper Virgin River CHU, and the Service is providing guidance for development of this plan. The BLM is pursuing land exchanges with the State of Utah for consolidation of desert tortoise habitat within the Upper Virgin River CHU for ease of management and for long-term conservation of the desert tortoise and other desert species. The BLM's Dixie Resource Area is currently preparing a Resource Management Plan to guide land management on BLM lands encompassing the Upper Virgin River CHU. Because of the area's small size and its proximity to an expanding urban population center, the Service has maintained that any significant losses of habitat within this area would likely jeopardize the continued existence of desert tortoises within the Upper Virgin River Recovery- Unit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Limitations of the Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The regional economy includes the full economic activity of each county in which proposed CHUs are located. CHUs generally are located in remote areas containing a very small fraction of the human population and total economic activity within a county. The entire county economy may not be affected by establishing CHUs; thus, the size of the relevant regional economy may be overstated. Likewise, important activities in rural areas may appear to be insignificant when compared to the entire regional economy. For example, mining does not appear to be an important employer in the seven counties, but may contribute to the economic stability of small rural communities that offer few other employment opportunities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Costs of Critical Habitat Designation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following sections summarize the results of the Service's analysis of data and identify the potential costs associated with the final designation of critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regional Effects to Livestock Industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Public lands in the four States in 1990 furnished nearly 3,000 operators with cattle grazing permits that provided more than 3 million AUMs (Table 4). The designation of critical habitat may partially or totally affect 51 cattle permits that provided 59,000 AUMs. Nearly all sheep grazing was eliminated from most CHUs prior to critical habitat designation; therefore, sheep grazing was not an activity examined in the economic analysis. The effect of CHU restrictions on the availability of Federal land for grazing varies widely among the States, from 0.6 percent of cattle AUMs in Nevada to 9.6 percent of cattle AUMs in California. Across the four States, CHUs may affect 1.7 percent of cattle and sheep grazing AUMs (note these effects apply to the States rather than the seven-county region, for which comparable data were not available).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic consequences of reduced cattle grazing on Federal lands to establish the proposed CHUs includes three effects. Ranch profits in the seven counties are estimated to fall by $4,470,000. This amount is the estimated permanent decrease in ranch profits, capitalized at 10 percent for a 50 year period, in accordance with the methodology of Rice  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1978). The Federal government will compensate allottees with a one-time payment estimated at $376,000 for the loss of permanent improvements to grazing lands (pending BLM administrative decisions of partially affected allotments). Discontinuing grazing leases will result in an annual reduction of $170,000 in collected grazing fees that are divided among range improvements, the U.S. Treasury, and local governments. The $170,000 is not a ``net'' annual reduction in that it does not include the reduced costs of grazing program administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / International Company News: Generale des Eaux bucks trend with 9.7% rise LA Generale des Eaux, France's largest water distribution and public services group, managed to buck the sluggish trend in French industry during the first half of the year by increasing net profits by 9.7 per cent to FFr1.1bn (Dollars 211m) from FFr1bn. The group, which said it was on course for further profits growth for the full financial year, also confirmed plans to participate in the recapitalisation of Lucia, a property company in which it is a 10 per cent shareholder and which is linked to the interests of Mr Christian Pellerin, the controversial French property developer. La Generale plans to invest FFr150m in Lucia's recapital-isation. Lucia has incurred heavy losses and has also been clouded by the controversy over the BP Tower development in Paris because of its association with Olipar, a Pellerin concern. Despite its difficulties in the property sector industry, La Generale increased interim turnover by 14 per cent from FFr62bn to FFr70bn and operating profits from FFr1.9bn to FFr2.5bn. The public works division saw turnover rise to FFr20.8bn from FFr19bn, mainly because of growth in its foreign activities. The group said it benefited from strong performances from its water, energy and health care divisions. However, it said that its property interests had suffered from the problems of both the residential and commercial sectors. La Generale said it anticipated net profits of FFr2.9bn for the full financial year, which would represent an 11.5 per cent advance on the FFr2.6bn it made in 1991. The group also forecast a rise in turnover from FFr134.9bn in 1991 to FFr144bn in 1992, on current exchange rates. France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications group, yesterday said it expected to make net profits of FFr3bn this year. The group earlier revised its reported profit for 1991 from the original figure of FFr1.3bn to FFr2.05bn because of a change in accounting techniques.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Need To Work Out Substantial Market-Opening </F> Measures"]    [Text] Japan's 13-year-old voluntary restraint on  automobile exports to the United States was a symbol of economic  friction with the United States. The restraint will be finally  abolished.    Now that car exports have decreased due to the yen's  appreciation and local production of automobiles overseas has  increased, there is no need to continue the self-restraint on  car exports to the United States. Meanwhile, the U.S. industry  has made a remarkable recovery. This indicates the end of the  era in which Japanese industry can enjoy an overwhelming victory  in the world market.    From now on, the Ministry of International Trade and  Industry  [MITI] should make additional efforts to adopt trade policies  based on multilateral trade rules. The economic circle also  should once again keep this fact in mind that its  economic-growth strategy centering on one-sided exports will not  last long.    The United States has begun calling for Japan's "voluntary  expansion of imports" in place of the voluntary restraint on  auto exports. It has demanded that Japan increase imports by  setting targets as it did so under the Japan-U.S. Semiconductor  Agreement. In the new Japan-U.S. economic consultations, the  country has made such demands in the three individual sectors,  including automobile and auto parts.    The U.S. demands seem to be desirable as compared with the  voluntary export-restraint which artificially curbs exports  because the U.S. demands will promote an increase in bilateral  trade. However, this can be applied only in the case where Japan  purchases cheap, good-quality products and parts. If the two  countries try to increase dealings forcibly by going to the  length of setting targets in trade talks, there will be  distortions in economic activities.    While Japan needs to make efforts to increase imports by  improving existing regulations and practices which constitute  import barriers, as well as by expanding domestic demand, it has  to reject unreasonable demands.    When viewed from this standpoint, some devices can be noted  in the "package of external economic measures" compiled by the  government. For example, the government has proposed that  procedures be improved in government procurement to facilitate  entry of products of foreign companies into the Japanese market  and that methods be introduced to follow up on results of the  entry of foreign products in three individual sectors.    However, the package only says that a conclusion will be  made  by about June on a program to increase public works  spending--which was cited as a means to maintain domestic demand  for the midterm--as well as tax system reform. Concrete  measures to ease regulations were not spelled out in the current  package.    Meanwhile, the package of external economic measures was  influenced by government's conventional idea of emphasizing  administrative instructions. While various automakers  voluntarily announced their plans to increase the purchase of  foreign auto parts, the government welcomed their plans.  Nevertheless, the word "voluntarily" is in name only. It has  been reported that MITI and politicians exerted a strong  behind-the-scenes influence on automakers.    The auto parts purchase plans were worked out by the private  sector. However, if automakers fail to achieve their goals  after setting numerical targets, the United States may use the  failure as an excuse for slapping sanctions on Japan. Moreover,  there is a fear that hardliners in the United States, who  believe Japan does anything if pressure is exerted, will gain  the upper hand after they notice that while the Japanese  Government is advocating deregulation in public, it has  continued behind-the-scenes administrative intervention in  industry.    In various aspects, relations between Japan and the United  States are in the transitional stage. To establish a truly  mature relationship between the two countries, the tense  situation will be unavoidable for the time being. Prime  Minister Hosokawa made a daring decision and said "No" to the  U.S. demand for setting numerical targets in trade talks. The  government must take a logical attitude in anticipation of a  certain tension in the bilateral relations.    What is imperative for the government is to come up with  substantial market-opening measures by the end of June. These  measures will help consumers receive benefits through such  factors as an increase in cheap imported goods.    Based on figures in official economic forecasts, the  government stipulated in the current package that the ratio of  Japan's current account surplus to its gross domestic product  has been decreasing since fiscal year 1992 when the ratio  reached its peak. However, what is important is not to indicate  figures but to root in Japan a system in which fluctuations in  the exchange rate connect with an decrease in exports and an  increase in imports.    Although the current package of external economic measures  is  not a satisfactory answer to the United States, the ball has  been thrown back to the U.S. side. It is hoped that the United  States will receive the ball and resume the new economic  framework talks. If the United States has any dissatisfaction,  it should express it in the venue for the framework talks.</p>

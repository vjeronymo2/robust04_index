			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "League Member To Head Parliamentary </F> Immunity Body"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, May 12 -- Marco Preioni of the Northern  League on Thursday [12 May] was elected president of the Upper  House body that rules over judicial requests to withdraw  parliamentary immunity against senators.    Preioni obtained 12 votes against the 11 won by outgoing  president Giovanni Pellegrino of the Left Democrat Party. Two  elections were needed because the first resulted in a tie  between Preioni and Pellegrino.    The new vice presidents of the commission are Lino Diana of  the People's Party and Elidio De Paoli of the Lombard Alpine  League.    Although approval by the body and a subsequent vote by the  full assembly are no longer necessary to lift parliamentary  immunity from investigation, magistrates still need the green  light from the committee to carry out searches, telephone taps  and preventive detention of legislators, unless the crimes carry  mandatory arrests and/or prison sentences of more than five  years.    Lawmakers can also be arrested without permission from the  legislative body if they are caught in the act of committing a  serious crime.    Preioni, 43, was a registered lawyer and a secondary school  teacher before being elected to the Senate with the Northern  League in 1992. He was a member of the Justice commission and  of the same body he now chairs.    Preioni's election set off a series of protests and  criticisms from opposition parties, who accused the three  right-wing coalition partners of bullying their way to the top  of all institutional bodies, even those that traditionally have  been led by the opposition.    "This government coalition," a communique from the Left  Democrat Party Senate caucus said, "is so power hungry that it  makes the old five-party coalition seem like a club of gentlemen  by comparison."    A right-wing Senate whip this morning announced the majority  would do the exact opposite of what it actually did when it  elected Preioni, the communique said, adding that the election  contradicts a tradition that gives chairmanships of many  commissions to the opposition parties.    With a majority and the chair of the body in charge of  granting waiver of parliamentary immunity, critics say, the  League could protect its own members of parliament from  prosecution.    "In Italy and in other civil countries there is a tradition  that gives leadership of this sort of body to the opposition,"  Lower House Left Democrat whip Luigi Berlinguer commented.    Livio Caputo of Forza Italia responded that there was no  "provocatory intent" in the election of Preioni and called the  entire affair an unfortunate "stop-gap incident" caused by  technical reasons. He said the present state of affairs may  turn out to be temporary.    Even the former Christian Democrats, who led coalition  governments for 40 years before falling apart in the wake of  corruption scandals, criticized the election of a majority  senator.    Nicola Mancino, who heads the senators of the party, now  renamed the People's Party, said this state of affairs will  "stiffen" relations between majority and opposition, especially  after the election of Carlo Scognamiglio of Forza Italia as  Senate speaker.</p>

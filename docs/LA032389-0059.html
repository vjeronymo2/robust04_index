			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> With Connie Chung headed for CBS News, NBC News executives plan to use the  $900,000 they've been paying her to hire three "seasoned correspondents,"  possibly one in New York and two in Washington bureau. An NBC official said the  network decided to let Chung go rather than meet her demands, which included  complete editorial control over a new prime-time news magazine program, the  right to name her own executive producer, assurance that she would be its sole  anchor and a significantly higher salary. At CBS, she'll take over as anchor of  "West 57th." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> INGLEWOOD BANS NEW MULTIPLE HOUSING;  </P> <P> 45-DAY MEASURE LETS CITY STUDY CURBS ON DENSITY  </P> <P> Despite pleas from South Bay developers, the Inglewood City Council bowed  Wednesday to residents' concerns, unanimously approving a 45-day moratorium on  high-density apartment and condominium developments across the city.  </P> <P> The emergency measure, which became effective immediately, prevents developers  from submitting new plans in areas zoned for multifamily units but does not  affect projects already in progress, city officials said. The measure bans  development in areas zoned for R-3, R-4 and P-1 multifamily housing, about 20%  of the land in the city.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Time for Study  </P> <P> The moratorium is aimed at giving city officials time to study long-term  methods of controlling growth in residential neighborhoods, such as zoning  changes that would impose new restrictions on high-density development. Most  apartment and condominium construction has been in council Districts 2 and 3 in  the city's northern and western sections.  </P> <P> "It freezes everything," said Councilman Jose Fernandez, whose District 3  constituents strongly supported the moratorium. "It gives us time to address  the issue. Nobody is against development. What we want is balance."  </P> <P> The council will consider new parking restrictions or one-way streets to  relieve traffic congestion in some neighborhoods. Another possibility will be  stricter enforcement of building codes that prohibit several families from  crowding into single-family homes, another factor that city officials said  contributes to density problems.  </P> <P> Developer Kerry Welsh from Redondo Beach called the moratorium "completely  illogical" and said its main effect will be to force housing costs up by  increasing the demand for housing. "The people have a drawbridge mentality," he  said in an interview. "They want to keep all developers out."  </P> <P> Last year, the city tightened development standards for multifamily units  through stricter height, setback and density requirements. But residents  complain that those measures have failed to prevent developers from buying up  single-family homes and replacing them with apartments and condominiums.  </P> <P> Inglewood school officials have also blamed the city's development boom for  severe overcrowding at many schools. To accommodate the new students, dozens of  portable classrooms have been hauled onto campuses, and school board members  are considering converting more schools to year-round schedules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Number Rises Slightly  </P> <P> Despite a recent boom in apartment and condominium development, the number of  housing units in Inglewood has risen only slightly since 1980, from 38,225 to  38,238, as the population has increased from 94,245 to 102,400, said Deputy  City Manager Lew Pond. He attributed the slow growth in overall housing units  to Century Freeway construction, which required the demolition of 200 units,  and two redevelopment projects that are converting land under the flight path  to Los Angeles International Airport from residential to industrial uses.  </P> <P> A lengthy public hearing before the council vote Wednesday became a fiery  debate. Residents complained about traffic congestion, crime and litter caused  by packing too many people into too small an area. Developers argued that  replacing the city's decaying housing stock improved the community's appearance  and image.  </P> <P> "The developers come in, they throw up some apartments, but they're out of  here," said Brenda Conyers, a member of the Historical Society of the Centinela  Valley, who lives in a 70-year-old house in Inglewood that was built by her  great-grandfather. "They kiss Inglewood goodby. They're in Redondo Beach.  They're in Torrance."  </P> <P> Longtime resident Mildred McNair called on developers to take as much interest  in the city's social welfare as they do in its economics.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Density, Crime Linked  </P> <P> Residents said drug and gang problems thrive in high-density neighborhoods,  although several developers said they could not understand why residents  connect new developments with crime.  </P> <P> "Drugs and gangs breed in areas that are dilapidated," said developer Mike  Walsh of Redondo Beach. "You don't see that in areas like Redondo Beach. You  see that in areas like Compton."  </P> <P> Councilman Anthony Scardenzan, who proposed the moratorium earlier this month,  responded: "We do have a heavy density that is a nesting place for drugs and  all crime. Armed robbery, drugs, break-ins -- you name it, they are there. My  constituents are fed up with that."  </P> <P> Mayor Edward Vincent, who strongly criticized the moratorium when it came  before the council earlier this month, supported it Wednesday.  </P> <P> "People will feel there's a certain amount of relief," he said in an interview.  "Apparently they connect crime and gangs with apartment buildings."  </P></p>

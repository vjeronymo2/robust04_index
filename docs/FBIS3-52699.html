			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Amman--AKHBAR AL-USBU' has learned that extensive  Jordanian-Gulf contacts are currently being held to pave the way  for holding an Arab summit to produce Arab reconciliation  committees to settle the existing political and border  differences among several Arab states, and to draft a formula  for a new Arab order that can coexist with the new world order  and make gains for the Arab nation.    Jordanian Foreign Ministry sources stressed that these  contacts have begun with the visits to Jordan by the foreign  ministers of Qatar, Syria, Egypt, and Palestine. The sources  said that these contacts will resume next week when the Omani  foreign minister visits Jordan on Saturday [8 January].    The Foreign Ministry sources said that these political Arab  moves constitute a translation of the official and popular  stands of Jordan, which feels that coordinating Arab stands and  achieving Arab solidarity constitutes the first step toward the  Arabs' entry into the modern age as an influential political and  economic force.    The sources noted that Qatar and Oman are currently seeking  to expand their political activities to hold a summit that will  be the most important and prominent Arab summit, especially  since it will put an end to fragmentation and estrangement and  achieve Arab unity and solidarity.</p>

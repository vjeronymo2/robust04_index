			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Observer: Open house How timely. The Department of Trade and Industry is holding a one-day seminar - A practical guide to UK export controls - on Friday. The morning session will explore such delicate questions as Why Export Controls?, while the afternoon session will involve a series of clinics where officials from the DTI, Ministry of Defence and HM Customs will dish out expert advice. Sounds like an ideal refresher course for a few of Her Majesty's ministers.</p>

The Croat Defense Council [HVO] has heavily defeated the Muslim  army. Zdenko Vranjes reporting for Croatian Radio from  Medjugorje.    In the course of heavy fighting in the Sofe area near Vitez,  HVO formations have managed to recapture trenches lost in recent  fighting. As the HVO Vitez brigade reports, a large number of  dead Muslim soldiers have been left behind in this area  following three days of fierce fighting. The HVO will not let  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] enter this area and inspect the  site unless the Muslim side enables the peace force to launch an  inquiry in Krizancevo Selo and Buhine Kuce, the Vitez brigade  has announced.    The Muslim army today continued attacking other villages,  too, near Vitez-Lazine and Buhine Kuce in particular. The  Muslim army's advance has been checked in this area, too.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From 5 April EESTI SENUMID, HOMMIKULEHT, pp. 1,3 ; "News </F> Bulletin" No. 64/94]    [Text] Members of Edgar Savisaar's cabinet met in Toompea  and in Maardu manor on Sunday [3 April] to celebrate the forming  of independent Estonia's first government four years ago.  Besides Savisaar, Siiri Oviir, Gennadi Golubkov, Tdnis Kaasik,  Olev Laanjirv, Ants laos, Jaak Leimann, Vello Lind, Rein Loik,  Rein Miller, Juri Raidla, Aleksander Sikkal, Jaak Tamm, Raivo  Vare, Tiit Vihi and Harri Eunapuu attended the meeting and  signed a joint statement. President Lennart Meri (foreign  minister in Savisaar's cabinet) also attended the meeting.    The statement pointed out that the actions of a government  have effect only after some years and declared that only history  will judge the actions of the present government. Estonia's  freedom is not yet irreversible and the necessary national unity  is being undermined by the deepening rift between the poor and  the wealthy, the former cabinet members warned.    Twelve ministers, including Savisaar and Vihi, held a news  conference yesterday. Savisaar called for democratic society,  systematic work and the involvement of competent specialists in  the government. He also pointed out that politics has  degenerated into petty squabbling between different forces.    Tiit Vihi declared that his cabinet did not differ  principally from that of Savisaar. Both ex-premiers rejected  suggestions that they may be forming a new alliance, but assured  that they are both ready to dedicate themselves to Estonia's  progress.</p>

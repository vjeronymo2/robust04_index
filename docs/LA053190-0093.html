			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S., GREECE SIGN PACT ON MILITARY BASES;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: THE ACCORD COMES AFTER YEARS OF BITTER DISPUTE. IT SIGNALS A MARKED  IMPROVEMENT IN TIES BETWEEN THE NATIONS.  </P> <P> After years of bitter disputes and tough negotiations, the United States and  Greece signed a new defense agreement Wednesday allowing American bases to stay  in the eastern Mediterranean country.  </P> <P> The major installations covered by the agreement are a U.S. Air Force base and  a Navy base on the island of Crete and about 20 smaller installations spread  across the country.  </P> <P> It was a further sign of dramatic improvements in relations since Prime  Minister Constantine Mitsotakis formed the first Conservative government in  nine years after an election victory on April 8.  </P> <P> The agreement was signed by U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan and Greek Ambassador  Christos Zacharakis on Wednesday morning, officials from both sides said.  </P> <P> Mitsotakis said this week the agreement will run for eight years, but after the  signing, officials declined to give details on the pact.  </P> <P> It replaces the five-year Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement, which  expired in December, 1988. The Americans had until the end of this year to pack  up and go home unless a new agreement was signed.  </P> <P> Under the previous defense agreement, Greece received $350 million in military  aid in 1989.  </P> <P> Negotiations on the new accord opened in November, 1987, but were marred by  angry disputes between the United States and Greece's then-ruling Socialist  government, which had vowed to close what its supporters called "the bases of  death."  </P> <P> Talks were suspended by the Socialists in May, 1989, after 17 rounds but  reopened after Mitsotakis won the April election.  </P> <P> Negotiations were made easier by a U.S. decision this year to shut two bases  due to budget cuts -- Hellenikon Air Base sharing Athens airport, and Nea Makri  Naval Communications Station, east of Athens.  </P> <P> The pact must be ratified by Greece's 300-seat Parliament, where Mitsotakis  controls 151 seats. The U.S. Senate will be informed about the agreement, but  its approval is not required.  </P></p>

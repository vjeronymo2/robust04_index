			<p>BFN     [Text] After the arrest of two dissidents in Beijing, there  have been reports that two more dissidents were arrested in  Shanghai just before the arrival in town of the French prime  minister. The French delegation immediately demanded  explanations from the Chinese authorities, only to be told that  these arrests had not taken place. Here is the reaction of  French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe:    [Begin Juppe recording] We demanded an explanation, and that  explanation was given to us by the minister who is accompanying  Mr. Balladur, by the deputy mayor of Shanghai, and by the  Chinese ambassador in France, who all formally told us that no  dissidents had been arrested in Shanghai in the last few hours.  This is what was told to us by official sources. We have taken  note. [end recording]    Things are not, however, as simple as that. Journalists  pressed Juppe to comment on the fact that the dissidents'  families had said they had been arrested, but at this point the  prime minister himself stepped in to put an end to the  conversation:    [Begin recording] [Balladur] To convince you once and for  all, I would advise you to get in touch with the Chinese  ambassador in Paris, and if perchance he should say the same  thing as the French foreign minister, then you will be perfectly  informed and reassured. I hope so at least.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are you convinced by their  explanations?    [Balladur] Yes.    [Correspondent] Is that a diplomatic yes?    [Balladur] Those are your words. Why do you ask? How would  you describe your lack of conviction? [end recording]    What has happened exactly? The Chinese authorities deny that  there were any arrests. We spoke, however, to the father of Bao  Ge [not further identified by name], who insisted that his son  was arrested in Shanghai:    [Begin recording] [Bao Ge's father, in Chinese with  superimposed French translation] He was taken away this morning  at 0900 by eight policemen, and he has still not come back to  his home in Shanghai. [end recording]    That interview was carried out by our Chinese service.</p>

			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SALES OF STEALTH FOR QUARTER: $657 MILLION  </P> <P> Northrop disclosed its quarterly revenue on the B-2 stealth bomber program for  the first time Tuesday, reporting in a letter to shareholders that the bomber  had sales of $657 million for the three months ending March 31.  </P> <P> Oddly, the company failed to disclose sales figures for the comparative period  last year, saying they remain classified by the Air Force. The letter to  shareholders is a more detailed account of the firm's quarterly earnings report  made public earlier.  </P> <P> The B-2 sales are almost exactly what securities analysts and procurement  experts have been estimating for years when they said that the bomber accounts  for about half of Northrop's sales. In the first quarter, the B-2 sales figure  amounted to 51% of Northrop's $1.28 billion sales. Quarterly sales the year  before were $1.37 billion. Its first-quarter profit was $9.7 million, down  sharply from $139.6 million a year earlier.  </P> <P> Ever since Northrop began the B-2 program in 1981, the company has been  prevented from disclosing sales and earnings on the program, though it was the  most important source of growth for the firm. An abundance of financial detail  on other programs, however, made the cloak over the B-2 somewhat transparent.  </P> <P> Wolfgang Demisch, an analyst at UBS Securities, said B-2 sales appear to be  declining, based on the $657-million figure. "It was generally believed that  the B-2 had maxed out at $3 billion per year and that would give you $750  million a quarter," Demisch said.  </P> <P> In a separate disclosure, the company said it has increased its line of  short-term credit, which may indicate that the company is preparing to take on  additional debt. Northrop Senior Vice President Les Daly said, "We don't know  if we will exercise it."  </P> <P> The aerospace firm experienced a negative cash flow and took on $132 million of  additional short-term debt in the quarter, the letter indicates.  </P> <P> The company said it is increasing its credit line to "150% of shareholders'  equity," which gives the company short-term borrowing capacity of roughly $1.5  billion, up from about $1.25 billion.  </P></p>

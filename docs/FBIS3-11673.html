			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Elizabeth Diaz Otero] </F>   [Text] Luis German Carcova, president of the Business  Coordinating Council, has made a spirited appeal to foreign  investors not to withdraw from the Mexican Stock Market -- a  most volatile market.    The council has urged national and foreign investors who  have  capital investments in Mexico to remain calm and not to make  hasty decisions. Luis German Carcova said the best way to  demonstrate a love for the country is to confront the situation  and to keep working.    [Begin Carcova recording] We ask them to remain calm and to  look at and analyze the situation carefully. We have to  determine within the next few hours how to best face this  situation. I am certain we will be able to resolve this  situation and that the Mexican people will continue to move  ahead. No one can stop us, and no one will.    We ask them to remain calm and not to make hasty decisions.  This is a time to demonstrate maturity and love for our  country. One of the best ways businessmen and investors can  demonstrate this love is by not splitting up, but, as the saying  goes, by sticking to their guns -- namely, work, investments,  and the generation of wealth and jobs. [end recording]    Carcova said he is angry about the assassination of Luis  Donaldo Colosio. [words indistinct] a leader of organized  businessmen, has said that in Mexico there are groups interested  in destabilizing the nation. The murder of Luis Donaldo Colosio  is clear evidence of this, he said.    In an interview at Los Pinos, Manuel Robleda, president of  the Mexican Stock Market, did not want, or was unable, to  predict what repercussions this event might have on the stock  market.</p>

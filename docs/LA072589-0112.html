			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHRIMPERS FORCE SUSPENSION OF LAW  </P> <P> With hundreds of angry shrimpers threatening to renew their blockade of Gulf of  Mexico ports, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher agreed Monday to suspend a  new requirement that shrimp boats be equipped with devices to keep sea turtles  from becoming ensnared in the nets.  </P> <P> The agreement, reached during an emergency meeting between Mosbacher and Gulf  Coast congressmen, placed an immediate 45-day moratorium on enforcement of the  federal law.  </P> <P> Just last Thursday, Mosbacher had ordered that the controversial law be  enforced after an earlier suspension.  </P> <P> The shrimpers say that the turtle-excluding devices cause them to lose as much  as 40% of their catch; conservationists say the rule is necessary to save an  endangered species of sea turtle.  </P> <P> Mosbacher announced the plan after meeting with about two dozen congressmen  from Gulf states. He said the suspension would allow a "cooling-off period."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Knin, Serb Krajina, May 14 (TANJUG) -- Serb Krajina  official Mile Novakovic said on Saturday that [14 May] Serb  Krajina authorities would demand that the U.N. Protection Force  (UNPROFOR) clearly state which of the sides to the  Krajina-Croatia conflict had violated the ceasefire, and specify  the time and place of the violations. There is no reason why  UNPROFOR should not say this, said General Novakovic, who chairs  the Serb Krajina central board for the implementation of the  ceasefire agreed between the Republic of Serb Krajina (R.S.K.)  and Croatia.    R.S.K. military officials will submit a request to this  effect to UNPROFOR Commander for Former Yugoslavia General  Bertrand de Lapresle in Topusko on Sunday. General Novakovic  stressed that the Serb side was willing to implement in full the  ceasefire agreement negotiated by the two sides in Zagreb in  March. This is our contribution to peace, in line with our  lasting commitment to dealing with the conflict with Croatia  only at the conference table, he stressed.    The R.S.K. was proclaimed in 1991 by the local Serbs in  those  parts within the arbitrary Communist-era borders of Croatia were  they are the majority population, in response to Croatia's  violent secession from former Yugoslavia and trampling on their  rights. The territory was placed under U.N. protection in the  Spring of 1992.    General Novakovic indicated that the number of U.N.  observers  patrolling the line of separation between the belligerents was  not adequate, and that UNPROFOR was still not using helicopters  in the control and supervision of the ceasefire. These  omissions on the part of UNPROFOR have resulted in inadequate  control and hence inaccurate estimates of the implementation of  the ceasefire agreement, said Novakovic.    Representatives of the European Union's observer team  conferred with R.S.K. military authorities at the R.S.K. capital  of Knin on Saturday about cooperation and the implementation of  the ceasefire agreement. The leader of the team, General  Mourmouris Panagiotis of Greece, told the press that the talks  had been frank, substantive and useful.    R.S.K. Army Commander General Milan Celeketic said that  common ground had been found on questions of mutual interest.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Arab League Ministerial Council is scheduled to  end its meetings of the 101st session held at the Arab League  headquarters in Cairo tonight. In a telephone conversation with  our newsdesk correspondent Suhayl Khuri, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan,  minister of state for foreign affairs, who is taking part in  these meetings, spoke about the results of this session:    [Begin recording] [Khuri] Good evening Your Excellency.    [Al-Hasan] Good evening.    [Khuri] What results did you achieve during the meetings of  the Arab League Ministerial Council in Cairo?    [Al-Hasan] During the four meetings held yesterday and  today, the Arab League Council discussed a number of important  issues and reviewed the agenda items. Foremost of these issues  were the Palestinian cause and developments in the peace  process. Moreover, the ministers discussed the horrific Israeli  crime perpetrated in the holy Ibrahimi Mosque in the middle of  the holy month of Ramadan and its following coercive measures  against the defenseless Palestinian citizens.    At the council, I explained His Majesty King Husayn's  immediate efforts in the wake of this crime and the Jordanian  Government's measures and contacts. Through these measures and  contacts, the Jordanian Government expressed its clear  condemnation of this crime, held Israel fully responsible,  demanded that the international community shoulder its  responsibilities and force Israel to provide necessary  international protection for the Palestinian people, and  stressed that racist settlement building and settlements must be  removed as they represent an obstacle to peace.    The council also reviewed developments in the peace process  and the resolutions we adopted in the past to support this  process since it is a strategic Arab choice to solve the  Arab-Israeli conflict.    The council discussed joint Arab action. It decided to  postpone making decisions on the issue of pan-Arab security.  Jordan had presented a detailed study on this issue during the  council's previous session proceeding from Jordan's concern  about this issue and since it is considered a priority issue.  The council also decided to postpone the issue of amending the  Arab League's charter because it is closely linked to the issue  of pan-Arab security.    [Khuri] When do you expect the Ministerial Council to end  its discussion of the agenda items and issue a final statement?    [Al-Hasan] Of course, the council will hold a meeting in a  short while to review all the decisions after the committees  have ended their meetings. The council will hold a general  session to review all these decisions.    [Khuri] Your Excellency: How do you assess the atmosphere  of the Ministerial Council's meetings?    [Al-Hasan] I can say that this meeting was positive.    [Khuri] Thank you Your Excellency.    [Al-Hasan] You are welcome. [end recording]</p>

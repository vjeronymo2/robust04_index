			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Oftel tells BT to lower prices LOWER PHONE bills are in prospect after BT, the telecommunications group, was told yesterday to accept a tough new pricing regime or face investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, proposed that BT should be forced to cut the average level of its prices by 7.5 percentage points below the rate of inflation, compared with 6.25 points at present. Given the current level of inflation at 4.3 per cent, this would mean many customers would receive cuts in their phone bills. To help small customers, connection charges would be cut to Pounds 99 from the present Pounds 152.75 and a more generous scheme would be introduced for those who seldom use the phone. Moreover, BT, which wanted to increase line rental charges by 8 points more than inflation annually, would only be allowed to increase them by 2 points. In making its proposals, Oftel wants to ensure residential customers share the benefits of price cuts and to help BT's rivals compete against it. The package is harsher on BT than expected and the last from Sir Bryan Carsberg before he steps down as Oftel director-general at the end of this week. The proposals have been influenced by criticism that BT's profits - Pounds 3.07bn in the last financial year - are excessive and that domestic customers have received a poor deal since the company was privatised in 1984. Business would still be the main beneficiary, with bills falling by about 10 percentage points below inflation each year.

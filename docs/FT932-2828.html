			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / Sixth-forms at record level THE PROPORTION of those aged 16 and 17 staying on at school has reached a record this year, according to Department for Education figures. For the first time, more than half (53 per cent) of all 16-year-olds to 18-year-olds are in full-time education in the present academic year, while the number of full-time pupils in the age-group has also reached a record high at 920,000. However, the high proportion was helped by a drop in the total of 16-year-olds, and the recession has encouraged more pupils to stay at school. Mr Tim Boswell, the further education minister, was delighted by the figures. He said: 'The expanding opportunities and choice in education are being widely recognised by the young people for whom they are intended.' The trends over a longer period are even more marked. The proportion of 16-year-olds in full-time education has increased from 48 per cent to 71 per cent over the last five years, an increase 2.5 times greater than over any previous five-year period. The proportion of 17-year-olds staying in full-time education rose from 33 per cent to 55 per cent over the same period, while the figure for 18-year-olds rose from 18 per cent to 34 per cent.</p>

			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL REPORTING  </P> <P> As a professional in commercial real estate, I would like to address the  virtual disappearance of commercial real estate reporting.  </P> <P> Obviously, with the new residential focus, the section enjoys a much broader  readership among subscribers.  </P> <P> However, those of us in the commercial sector can't help but be disappointed.  Given that Southern California is one of the strongest commercial real estate  markets in the country, it would seem that it merits more attention than the  sporadic appearance of the one-half page "Commercial Scene" column.  </P> <P> TODD L.

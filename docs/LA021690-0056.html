			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> RAPACIOUS SEA LIONS FACE RUBBER ARROWS  </P> <P> Wildlife officials desperate to save migrating salmon and steelhead began  firing rubber-tipped arrows at the sea lions responsible for decimating the  fish runs through the Ballard Locks.  </P> <P> Washington state Wildlife Department spokesman Bob Byrne said the arrows will  fly at the locks weekday mornings through March. "The goal of the rubber tips  is to use this negative stimuli -- pain -- coupled with an underwater sound so  that the sound becomes the negative stimuli," Byrne said. Byrne said the  department's goal is to save 1,600 fish in an expected run of 2,100. But he  said workers will be lucky to spare 900.  </P></p>

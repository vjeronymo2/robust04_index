			<p>BFN     [Text] When asked about the remarks made by Julio Cesar  Vasconcellos, who stressed that it would be an insult to the  independence of the branches of government if there was a call  for the impeachment of Supreme Court members, and that it could  cause anarchy in the country that would fully justify closing  Congress, President Juan Carlos Wasmosy said: "I will do  everything in my power to maintain this democratic process. I  believe that even with all the mistakes and imperfections, we  are advancing and that all of us have to mature, but I will  never implement a measure that will cause a backward step in  this democratic process. I am following this very closely."    The possibility of closing Congress was rejected by Wasmosy,  who indicated that he would not accept any type of pressure,  even if it existed, to close Congress.    Asked what "everything in my power" meant, the chief of  state  indicated that he was referring to his absolute desire to make  the democratic process work. "In other words, I am going to  give this democratic process everything that I can to  consolidate it, and I do not believe the democratic process will  be consolidated by closing Congress. That is what I meant," he  stressed. Asked whether that desire had limits, he said: "There  are no limits."    Army Commander Division General Lino Cesar Oviedo indicated  that there are no signs in our country of the possibility of a  self-coup through the closing of Congress, and he also rejected  that he would support any type of attempt to violate the  Constitution.    "In principle I see no signs of a self-coup. This is all I  can say," the military chief said.    He added that the military chiefs will obey the decisions of  Juan Carlos Wasmosy, commander in chief of the Armed Forces and  president of the nation, as long as he rules his government on  the basis of the Constitution.    "I am going to cooperate with President Wasmosy on the basis  of his oath to respect the Constitution and have it respected.  In this way I will cooperate because I risked my life for  democracy," he stressed when he insisted that he will not  support any type of coup d'etat that violates the Constitution.    Oviedo also indicated that the project to reduce and  modernize the military structure remains firm. "Within the Army  there are six fewer generals, and the Paraguayan Armed Forces'  budget is located in third place of the lowest budgets in the  world," he said.    Oviedo stated that the operational costs of our country's  Armed Forces are the lowest in the world in relation to the  number of its inhabitants.    He explained that the clearest indication that there has  been  a reduction in the Armed Forces is the fact that its budget was  cut 27 percent compared with last year's budget.</p>

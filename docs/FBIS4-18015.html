			<p>BFN     [Text] In Karabakh, despite Russian Defense Minister  Grachev's proposal, backed by Azerbaijan, to start a cease fire  as of 00:00, April 28, the two sides have continued to shell  each other's positions. However, major battles, as both  Stepanakert and Baku claims, have come to a halt, which is  explained by rain and fog in Karabakh .    As INTERFAX has learned from the Karabakh army's press  service, Azerbaijani troops after midnight struck Karabakh  positions at Talish, a community in the north of the Mardakert  region. Casualty figures are as yet unavailable.    Armenian units, in turn, according to Azerbaijan's Defense  Ministry, fired rockets into Terter and nearby villages,  bordering with Karabakh. Villages in the Tauz region of  Azerbaijan were also shelled from Armenia.    The spokesman claimed that despite the Armenians provocative  actions, the Azerbaijanis did not retaliate.    Meanwhile, a spokesman for Azerbaijani President Gaydar  Aliyev has dismissed as unfounded Stepanakert's demand that  Aliyev address a formal truce offer to the Karabakh authorities.  The Karabakh leadership has declared that only after such a  request, can it respond to Grachev's proposal to cease fire.    As a senior official has told INTERFAX, "there can be no  more  formal statements other than those made by Azerbaijan's head of  state two days ago and the statement made by the Russian defense  minister."    In his words, "If the opposite side sincerely desires peace,  such a statement by an Azerbaijani leader, reaffirmed by a top  Russian mediator in the peace process would be taken as an  overture of peace."    He believes that by turning down the offer to cease fire,  Armenia is rejecting yet another Russian peace initiative.</p>

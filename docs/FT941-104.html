			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Enhanced redundancy terms for miners may be dropped The government is likely to end British Coal's enhanced redundancy scheme from the end of next month in a move that could encourage thousands of miners to seek to leave the industry before then. Replacing the scheme by a less generous package would be attacked by the opposition and union leaders as a betrayal of the 10,000 miners still in the industry. British Coal hopes to soften the blow by offering a one-off bonus for miners who go on working. In exchange it would expect miners to accept significant changes in working practices before privatisation later this year and next. The changes would ease problems surrounding the sell-off. They would make British Coal more attractive to prospective bidders who, under European legislation, will have to honour the terms and conditions governing workers in the businesses they take over, initially at least. Treasury restrictions make it very unlikely that British Coal could offer both its existing enhanced redundancy package and loyalty bonuses. Although the Department of Trade and Industry has still to make final decisions, indications are that it would prefer the bonuses. The likely termination of the existing redundancy package from April 30 follows a series of extensions and improvements since the scheme was introduced in January 1990. The enhanced terms have helped British Coal reduce its mining workforce to about a quarter of the total of more than 40,000 two years ago. In recent closures miners have been eligible for payments of up to Pounds 44,000, and the average of about Pounds 27,000 is almost unprecedented for manual workers in any industry. However, with the bulk of the pre-privatisation rationalisation complete, the political need for the scheme has diminished. An announcement to withdraw existing terms would lead to a flood of applications for redundancy. Although British Coal can refuse requests for redundancy, saying no would inevitably cause morale problems. Of the 18 remaining pits, between two and four may close before privatisation but the closures could be effected before April 30. British Coal may present the package as compensation for miners' failure to win pay awards for the last two years as well as a reward for loyalty. However, ministers are keen to change work patterns and erode demarcation before privatisation. British Coal declined to comment on plans for the redundancy package or loyalty bonus. The DTI said it was a matter for British Coal.</p>

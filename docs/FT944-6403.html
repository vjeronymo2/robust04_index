			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Unions force Iberia to scale down planned cuts The management of Iberia, Spain's loss-making national carrier, yesterday scaled back ambitious cost-cutting measures in the face of fierce union strike action. Iberia, which had wanted a 15 per cent pay cut over two years as part of a viability plan to stem heavy losses, accepted the unions' offer to cut wages by 8 per cent. The company also agreed to make up back pay totalling Pta10bn (Pounds 49m), owed under earlier salary agreements, which it had previously said it was not in a position to honour. As part of the agreement, two union officials who sat on the airline's board will also join its four-member executive committee. A number of joint management and union committees have been set up to monitor the viability plan. The settlement was welcomed by the industry minister, Mr Juan Manuel Eguiagaray, who said it set the stage for the injection of fresh public subsidies to the airline. The aid package, likely to total Pta130bn, has to be authorised by a sceptical European Commission. Brussels permitted Madrid to pay a 'final' subsidy of Pta120bn to Iberia in 1992 but much of this has since been lost in ambitious but unprofitable acquisitions in Latin America. Analysts believe Iberia has now bowed to union pressure and failed to address Iberia's uncompetitive cost structure. 'The agreement looks like a climbdown,' said Ms Alexandra Perricone, Spain country analyst of brokers James Capel in London. Wildcat strikes by the company's 25,000 employees on Monday closed 40 domestic airports, stranded more than 100,000 passengers and incurred Pta1bn losses for the airline. Air traffic returned to normal yesterday but Iberia, which has accumulated losses of Pta150bn, is on course to lose Pta44bn this year. The agreement increases the number of redundancies, through incentives and early retirement, from 2,200 over two years to 3,500 over three years.</p>

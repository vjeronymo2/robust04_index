The Abkhazian Defense  Ministry told Interfax that the Abkhazian army had taken the  initiative and forced the Georgian formations to retreat to the  canyon. According to the Abkhazian Defense Ministry, the  Georgian side suffered casualties. The Georgian troops also lost  two tanks, a Shilka anti-aircraft mounting and several artillery  weapons.    Non-official sources maintain that there are up to 1,500  people in the Georgian formations and a large amount of military  equipment. Abkhazian military experts believe that if the  Georgian formations break the blockade they will secure an  advantageous position for sabotage and other military  operations, including in Sukhumi (the Abkhazian capital).    The Abkhazian Defense Ministry told Interfax that a  significant number of Georgian servicemen and military armored  equipment had been gathered on the Georgian-Abkhazian border  lying on the Inguri River.    Most Georgian servicemen were gathered near the populated  center of Jvari which is quite close to the Inguri Hydro  Electric Power Station, Abkhazian intelligence reported.</p>

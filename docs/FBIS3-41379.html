			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] A South African businessman was yesterday fined  K130,000 in a Lusaka magistrates court when he pleaded guilty to  having Mandrax worth K304,200 and cannabis.    Acting principal resident magistrate Mr Philip Musonda fined  Johannes Molife Masire, 42, because he wanted him to reform  since he was a first offender.    Masire's womanfriend Esther Makawala, 32, businesswoman of  Lilanda township was acquitted after the State withdrew the case  against her.    According to facts, Drug Enforcement Commission officers  (DEC) searched Nakawala's house where they found 76 tablets of  Mandrax hidden under a refrigerator and another 93 tablets were  found in his car.    The officers also found 5.3 grammes of cannabis worth K530.    In mitigation Masire's defence lawyer Mr Nigel Mofya said he  was a first offender who required counselling on the dangers of  drugs.    Mr Musonda warned Masire to refrain from dealing in drugs.  If  he came to court again for a similar offence he risked a 10-year  prison sentence.    The vehicle and the refrigerator were forfeited to the  State.    In the same court, a hearing in which Lusaka businessman  Webster Mwenso and two traders have pleaded not guilty to having  Mandrax was adjourned for trial to January 6 because the DEC  prosecutor Mr Lufwendo Saboi was in Livingstone.    Mwenso, 53, of Roma, is charged with Andreas Paraskepolous,  43 and Joannides Axiotis, 39, for having 1,149 grammes of  Mandrax on April 27.    Paraskepolous and Axiotis' application for temporary release  of their passports was granted but they had to pay K100,000 each  as surety.    Their defence lawyer Mr Victor Kamanga said his clients  intended to travel out of Zambia during the adjournment.  [passage omitted]</p>

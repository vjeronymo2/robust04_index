			<p><P> September 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE VOTES TO PROTECT FLAG  </P> <P> My heart sank when I heard it is now illegal to "desecrate" the flag. Who is to  say what is desecration? How can it possibly be distinguished from freedom of  expression?  </P> <P> Our elected representatives championed this simplistic issue to improve their  popularity ratings. Unfortunately, doing what's popular is more important to  them than doing what's right. And if outlawing flag-burning will improve their  ratings, that's what matters. Not whether our basic rights are at stake.  </P> <P> Expressing dissatisfaction with government is what our country was founded  upon. Our lawmakers have now removed that right from us, and we have supported  it.  </P> <P> SUSAN HOHENHAUSEN  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BORDER BRUJO': FROM AZTEC TO HIGH TECH;  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE ART: GUILLERMO GOMEZ-PENA'S TWISTED BORDER TRAVELOGUE OFFERS LIVE  AND VIDEO VERSIONS OF LIFE THROUGH THE EYES OF A SHAMAN.  </P> <P> In Guillermo Gomez-Pena's "Border Brujo II," the brujo, or shaman, labels the  border region the ultimate casa de cambio -- a full-service house of exchange  where "anything can change into anything."  </P> <P> Dollars can be changed into pesos and the brujo can change "from Aztec to high  tech without missing a beat."  </P> <P> That is precisely what happens, and rather stunningly, in Gomez-Pena's new,  multimedia version of his twisted border travelogue, which incorporates a video  by Isaac Artenstein.  </P> <P> For the first half of the show (closing tonight at 8 at Sushi Performance  Gallery), Gomez-Pena performs live, seated at a table adorned with candles, a  few props and the radio that provides the musical and commercial prompts for  brujo incarnations. In the second half, Gomez-Pena lies prone before the  audience while Artenstein's video -- which simply depicts the brujo on a  slightly more elaborate set -- is projected onto a screen, with the electronic  brujo continuing Gomez-Pena's multi-persona litany of sometimes angry,  sometimes funny observations about life on the border.  </P> <P> The purist may ask: "Why a video? I paid to see a live performance, not watch  television." (The video is, in fact, part of a work-in-progress -- a  feature-length film a la performance artist Spaulding Gray's "Swimming to  Cambodia." Do they dare call it "Swimming to America"?)  </P> <P> The decision to add a high-tech element to Gomez-Pena's decidedly low-tech  stage show was wise. On a physical level, it allows the audience to see,  through Artenstein's selection of camera angles and deft editing, the brujo up  close and personal. Gomez-Pena is a compelling live performer, and his  electronic counterpart -- with searing eyes and sneering visage -- is no less  powerful.  </P> <P> On a psychic level, the multimedia approach provides another realm, another  dimension for the brujo to enter. When Gomez-Pena is performing live, seated  and speaking into a microphone, he seems like a disc jockey broadcasting on a  border radio station with an otherworldly wattage. Video makes the border brujo  a mystical media mogul. The live brujo can rest while his electronic alter ego  dramatizes the "tormented privilege" of living in California. Imagine turning  on the TV, flipping through the cable channels and coming across a guy in a  wrestling mask, sitting at his throne on the shrine of border culture, and  speaking in tongues.  </P> <P> He also speaks Indian dialects, Spanish and English, and their bastardizations:  "Spanglish" and "Inglenol." Many of Gomez-Pena's clever word plays require at  least some bilingual ability on the part of audience. Some are further obscured  by his often rapid-fire delivery and, at Thursday's opening performance, by the  nuances of amplification and Sushi's murky acoustics.  </P> <P> But toward the end, as the live brujo rises and performs with the video brujo,  a gripping visual scene unfolds with the dual images. It is slightly impaired  by the presence of the video projector, which is necessarily in close  proximity. If the creators continue this multimedia approach, the effect would  be enhanced by a rear screen projector.  </P> <P> Now that the brujo also has an electronic life, perhaps the live brujo can  leave the confines of the theater and return to the streets, where  confrontational performance art is most effective and where Gomez-Pena has  often exhibited his political poetics. There's an intersection in rural  Carlsbad begging for a command performance.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ENCORE: New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who'll pay the Angels  $200,000 for interfering in their negotiations with ex-Yankee Dave Winfield  (C1), has left his tracks in Anaheim before. . . . In November, 1979, he was  fined $5,000 for "tampering" with the Angels' free agent Brian Downing (above).  . . . Against league rules, Steinbrenner said publicly that he wanted to sign  Downing. Little wonder: that season, Downing hit .326, league tops among  right-handers. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

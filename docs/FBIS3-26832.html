			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Last of seven installments: Report on interview with Hu </F> Angang (5170 7254 6921) and Kang Xiaoguang (1660 2556 0342),  specialists of the Group for Analyzing the National Situation,  under the Chinese Academy of Social Science, by staff reporter  Liu Lu (0491 7216); date, place not given: "Fight Against  Corruption Cannot Rely on Campaigns; Gradual Political Reforms  Can Work"]    [Text] There is a cost to reforms. I asked Hu Angang and  Kang Xiaoguang: "Have you ever calculated the cost of your  anticorruption measures?"    They replied: The two anticorruption measures we have  proposed -- "maintaining the Army with regular taxes" and  "maintaining the government with regular taxes" -- do require  huge expenses from the government; the precondition for them is  that the state must boost its powers to increase revenue. This  issue has been addressed in a national situation report,  entitled: "Report on China's State Powers," coauthored by Hu  Angang and another scholar, Wang Shaoguang, in which they made a  detailed analysis of the problem. What we are proposing -- like  lowering tariff rates, abolishing non- tariff trade barriers and  foreign trade franchises, and seriously restricting monopolies  -- does not require many government resources, except a  reduction in tariff income. Howver, what we gain from  stimulating technological imports and promoting the  competitiveness of domestic enterprises will be far greater.  Breaking trade monopolies will reduce social trade costs by a  considerable margin. The deregulation of interest rates and  merging them with market rates, as we propose, will earn the  government handsome revenues, because when commercial banks earn  huge profits, the government will obtain enormous resources from  the banks' profit remittances and through taxing them.    Hu Angang and Kang Xiaoguang stressed: The ability to halt  graft is a yardstick by which we can meaure if a political  system is really institutionalized and efficient. We believe  that stamping out corruption through institutional innovation  depends on the progress not only of economic, but also political  structural reforms, and of the development of socialist  democratic politics. As political development in China trails  economic development, and political structural reforms lag  behind economic structural reforms, the focus of the next reform  program should be an active and steady push for political  structural reform.    This, then, requires other significant reformist measures;  for example: the division and checks of political powers, the  scope and delimitation of government functions, streamlining and  restructuring government organizations, the pursuit of a civil  service system and the improvement of government officials'  quality, strengthening the supervisory system, asserting the  independence of the judiciary, improving the legal system,  allowing the media a watchdog role, and so on.    On the means of pursuing the anticorruption campaign, Hu  Angang and Kang Xiaoguang said: The anticorruption campaign  cannot rely on mass movements or political campaigns, which  cannot tackle the institutional flaws and failings from which  corruption grew. The former two either spawn confusion or  result in turmoil.    The fight against corruption is an institutionally  innovative  activity. It must be carefully designed, thoroughly organized,  and patiently enforced. Its completion will not be in fiery and  noisy campaigns or revolution, but the end result of a daily,  orderly, almost undetectable process. There has never been any  significant social reform in history that "owed its success to  one decisive battle." The most successful road for  institutional reform is that of active gradualness.</p>

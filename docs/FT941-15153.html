			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Arts: Xerxes provides a sumptuous feast - Opera How many modern Handel stagings get to enjoy revival for a fourth time around? That is the rare and happy achievement of Nicholas Hytner's version of Xerxes, deftly reproduced once more by Julia Hollander for the English National Opera. The translation, too, is by Hytner - bright Restoration pastiche for the arias, cocky fast-forwards to modern talk in the recitatives, all of it singable. Hytner is a man of many parts. Xerxes (Serse in the original Italian) is late-middle Handel, one of his few semi-comic operas. Hytner treats the opera comically throughout, and not just the buffo scenes. That entails only minor losses. The feast of arias that Xerxes provides - there is a little duetting later on, and a final septet, but otherwise Handel's Italian soloists had to reign supreme - survives a bit of guying in the 'serious' numbers. Hytner laces the statelier ones with loopy visual jokes in the background, just to keep things going, and for some vehement arias he encourages cod extravagances: while Xerxes' romantically despairing brother, Arsamenes, (Christopher Robson) sings the last of his many laments, he shrivels into womb position on the floor. If Xerxes were a lofty melodrama like most Handel operas, grand Persian panoplies and cohorts would seem de rigueur. But besides the comic go-between Elviro (chirpily taken now by Paul Napier-Burrows), the main plot itself is a frothy nonsense of lovelorn confusions. Hytner has transferred it to an 18th-century spa (Persepolis is glimpsed in the distance), peopled by starchily indifferent guests and grand, whey-faced servants, the better to point up the absurdity of it all. It is not overdone, and David Fielding's very pretty designs are rich in off-the-wall jokes. The silly story is a frail reed for carrying a 3 1/2 -hour opera (this Xerxes is bravely uncut), but the arias do make a sumptuous feast. Of the seven excellent principals, Robson and Yvonne Kenny are old hands in the show (neither in best voice, but alert and engaging nonetheless), and so are the stalwart Louise Winter and Jean Rigby. in breeches-roles. As Xerxes' commander Ariodates, Mark Richardson makes an impression of character and fine musical sense out of all proportion to his meagre part. The winning new Atalanta is Nerys Jones, bright-voiced and with the mobile face of a clever sit-comedienne. The conductor Ivor Bolton, probably anxious about the passing hours, occasionally hustles the score along too hard, but he also realises much of the music in beautiful style. For Handelians, this is an evening of many delights.</p>

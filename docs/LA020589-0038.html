			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE COMPLETE BOOK OF DECORATIVE PAINT TECHNIQUES BY ANNIE SLOAN AND KATE GWYNN  (SALEM HOUSE; 1988)  </P> <P> PAINT, THE MOST versatile and affordable decorating tool, can be used in  traditional, contemporary, artful, whimsical or zany applications. Here's a  comprehensive guide for those who may attempt their own decorative painting on  walls, ceilings, woodwork or furniture. Each technique is clearly illustrated  step-by-step in color photographs. What the authors call basic finishes --  sponging, mutton clothing, ragging, color washing, combing, spattering -- are  dealt with first. Then comes information on more advanced techniques -- gesso,  marbling, porphyry, granite, moire, tortoise shell, wood finishes, wood  graining, and gold leaf. A glossary further explains terms and techniques.  ($29.95) Virginia Gray  </P></p>

			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Russian President places wreath at Polish monument Mr Boris Yeltsin yesterday became the first Russian leader to lay a wreath at a monument to Polish officers murdered in 1940 by the Soviet security police, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Relatives of the murdered officers praised Mr Yeltsin for the gesture intended to heal wounds over the massacre at Katyn forest near Smolensk. Until 1990, Moscow blamed their deaths on the Germans. However, there were calls for Russia to release all documents about the crime and to build a cemetery for the victims.</p>

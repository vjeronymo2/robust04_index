			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Death investigation unlikely to reopen A Tenerife judge is considering whether to reopen the investigation into Mr Robert Maxwell's death having received the video of a second autopsy from Paris Match, the magazine. However, the prosecutor in Santa Cruz thought it unlikely the video would reveal anything which would lead to a new investigation. Paris Match last week alleged that the autopsy, carried out in Israel shortly before Mr Maxwell was buried, found signs of beating on the body. The edition was later removed from sale amid claims of inaccuracies.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, May 16 (XINHUA) -- China's largest  economic center of Shanghai is speeding up educational reform by  cooperating with foreign institutions and individuals in running  15 schools.    According to educators here, these schools are aimed at  training talented people for Shanghai's modernization, and  extending the friendship between local residents with overseas  Chinese and foreign friends.    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in  1949,  Shanghai's foreign contacts in education had been limited in the  exchanges of students, inter-school academic activities and  overseas donations.    With the deepening of China's national reform and opening  further to the outside world, many overseas institutions and  individuals who were attracted by Shanghai's economic and social  development wanted to cooperate with the city in running schools.    The 15 schools were selected from overseas applicants with  an  approval of the State Education Commission.    They are run jointly by the Chinese and institutions and  individuals from Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, Britain,  the United States, Germany and Japan.    Two of them are technical schools and the rest are junior,  second and tertiary educational institutions, all of which are  non-profit organizations.    To ensure the healthy development of these schools, the  Shanghai Municipal Government issued a regulation on  administration of cooperation in running schools by overseas  institutions and individuals in Shanghai early this year to  protect the legal rights of people in running the schools.    "To cooperate with overseas institutions and individuals in  running schools may help us absorb overseas capital and use  foreign experience for reference in running schools," said  professor Wang Shenghong, director of the office of public  health and education under the Shanghai Municipal Government and  director of the municipal higher-learning education.    "It will also be beneficial to training talented people  needed for Shanghai's modernization and protecting the  patriotism of overseas Chinese and promoting friendship of  foreign friends," he said, "and it will benefit Shanghai's  education."    According to professor Wang, these schools are advanced in  facilities and strict in administration and teaching, and their  courses are in line with the needs of Shanghai's economic and  social development.    One example is the Shanghai-British qualification  examination  committee for certified public accountants, a joint venture  between the Shanghai Pudong Continuous Education Center with the  British chartered Association of Certified Accountants.    Trainees from the committee have been welcomed and  appreciated by enterprises.    Students at a business training institute, which is jointly  run by the Shanghai Institute for Training Young Managerial  Workers and a Hong Kong company, are using advanced computers  and other equipment provided by the Hong Kong side.    Professor Wang noted that several higher-learning  institutions in Shanghai are holding talks with overseas  organizations on cooperation in setting up schools in the New  Pudong Area to train more qualified people in industrial and  commercial management.    The New Pudong Area is a newly-established economic zone  that  is expected to lead the transformation of Shanghai's industrial  and financial sectors.</p>

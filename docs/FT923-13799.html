			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Letter: Goal posts moved to get trains in on time Sir, The Citizen's Charter promised us, among other things, a better service on British Rail. It looks as though it will lead to the opposite. When I first began to use the Intercity 125 between London and Bristol Parkway in 1975 the non-stop service took 1 hour 4 minutes and occasionally we pipped the hour. Last year the fastest non-stop 125 took a scheduled 1 hour 11 minutes and it was sometimes late. Then came the British Rail Charter ensuring us of punctuality and compensation for delays and what happens? The summer timetable issued last month shows the non-stop 125 service will now take a scheduled 1 hour 22 minutes, the two-stop service 1 hour 30 minutes (previously 1 hour 22 minutes) and the three-stop service 1 hour 37 minutes (1 hour 28 minutes). At a stroke they lose in two critical areas - reduced customer satisfaction and reduced potential utilisation of trains and track by 15 per cent - which makes it even harder for BR to reach its business targets. The salt was rubbed in the wound by our senior conductor proudly announcing one morning that the service had arrived in Paddington eight minutes early when last month it would have been two minutes late. And station staff in Bristol Parkway have installed a notice board to demonstrate their new 'punctuality'. I'm not sure which is more depressing - the transparency of the confidence trick on passengers or the bankruptcy of ideas in British Rail that the only way it can tackle moderately challenging targets is to make the goal posts wider. How will it ever improve? Brian McEvoy, Little Wain Wells, Cuckoo, Wraxall, Bristol BS19 1PJ</p>

			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Magazine avalanche engulfs shops: Newsagents are unhappy with their wholesale agreements Mrs Jackie Grafton at Jonathan's newsagents in East Dulwich, south London, is wondering what to do with magazines such as Boards, Women &amp; Golf, and Traction. Although she never ordered them, they and other obscure titles keep appearing in deliveries from her wholesaler. She said: 'Every day I get loads of stuff I do not want, and it is just sitting on my shelf.' Mrs Grafton is not alone. Mrs Olive Heanue at Lucky News in Ilford, east London, said: 'I have bundles of magazines that I could never sell. I could practically open another shop with them.' Other newsagents have also been complaining about the wholesaler practice of routinely delivering unsolicited magazines to retailers. Under terms set by WH Smith, John Menzies, Surridge Dawson and Johnson's, the UK's four leading magazine wholesalers, retailers have to accept what are known in the industry as 'box-outs' - new or promoted magazines - with their regular orders. The Association of Newspaper and Magazine Wholesalers is working with the Periodical Publishers Association to develop a code of practice for magazine sales, which it hopes to present to retailers soon. Retailers are often required to pay for the magazines as many as three weeks before they can sell them or are able to return unsold stock. That can impose cashflow problems on some smaller newsagents. Many retailers say that the wholesalers are guilty of poor record-keeping, unpaid credits and bad judgment on the types of magazines they deliver in the box-outs. Mr John Rowe, director of wholesaler operations at the National Federation of Retail Newsagents, said: 'The weight of anecdotal evidence is so compelling as to demand investigation into the whole-salers' service competence.' Mr Ian Locks, chief executive of the PPA, said the magazine code of practice was being prepared partly in response to a newspaper code which was drawn up after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission found that some wholesaler practices were operating against the public interest. The newspaper code, which comes into effect in October, guarantees retailers greater rights of access to newspapers if they meet certain conditions. Publishers are concerned that a change in practices could endanger magazine supply. It is not clear whether the magazine code will address the newsagents' complaints. Some wholesalers are already trying to increase communications with their retailers. WH Smith, which supplies 43 per cent of the wholesale market, is meeting independent retailers in 22 regions to gather opinions in an initiative called the Independent Retailer Forum. Both WH Smith and John Menzies, the second-largest wholesaler, with a market share of 27 per cent, say they operate systems to accommodate retailers' needs. New magazines are not randomly allocated but are supplied to retailers based on sales of titles in related categories. If a new women's fashion magazine were launched, for example, a computer would determine the number of copies to distribute to a newsagent based on the retailer's regular sales of magazines such as Elle or Vogue. Mr Alex van Straubenzee of WH Smith said wholesalers were caught between the competing interests of publishers and retailers, but admits that 'since 1988 we have been exclusively focused on publishers, so we have adopted an amended strategy to take more notice of retailers'. But Mr Shoaib Punjani, owner of Punjani's newsagent in Holland Park, west London, said: 'The wholesalers do not listen to what we want. They look at computer projections and assume that the news agent is ignorant. It is sheer stupidity if they think that they have to hold our hands and tell us what we want.' The newsagents are afraid to play David to the wholesaler's Goliath. Mrs Mina Patel, owner of S &amp; M Newsagents in Streatham, London, said: 'I have tried to get some newsagents together. But some are afraid that the wholesalers will stop sending them newspapers.'</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Leading Article: Party pris THE FLIGHT of Mr Asil Nadir to northern Cyprus has left three government ministers facing accusations of improper behaviour after revelations that they had raised his case with the attorney general. Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Peter Brooke have provided convincing accounts of their motives in doing this. Mr Michael Mates languishes under the impression that he behaved foolishly in giving Mr Nadir a watch inscribed with a message which appeared to disparage those responsible for clearing up the mess after the collapse of his business empire. The fact that Mr Nadir was a significant contributor to the Conservative party has again raised wider questions over the funding of UK political parties. Reports that he sought help in adversity as a quid pro quo for gifts totalling Pounds 440,000 during the 1980s may be unfounded. But the secrecy surrounding donations to political parties makes it hard to counter the charge that wealthy individuals such as Mr Nadir are buying influence or political favours. The concern is heightened when the donations come from overseas, such as the Pounds 2m given to the Conservatives by the Greek shipping billionaire Mr John Latsis, or the sizeable gifts from two Hong Kong businessmen. The Conservatives seem to be the principal beneficiaries of private generosity. But Labour, too, had its own embarrassment in the Pounds 30,000 given by the late Mr Robert Maxwell. Labour is also vulnerable to attack over the role of union funding in determining party policy. Mr John Edmonds' stark claim this week that the GMB general union expected a say in the party in return for its financial support has undermined Labour's attempts to portray itself as loosening the union ties and representing a wider constituency. Greater disclosure of the funding of political parties would do much to avoid the accusation that wealthy donors are buying influence. Companies and unions are already required by law to publish details of political donations. Parties should be required to disclose donations over a modest limit made from individuals and other sources. Unless such a requirement is introduced, the suspicion will remain that political parties are swayed by the wishes of those who pay their bills.</p>

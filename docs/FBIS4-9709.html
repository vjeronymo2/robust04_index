			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the government in Guatemala City on 30 </F> March]    [Text] The Guatemalan Government reports given the crimes  that occurred in San Cristobal Verapaz on 29 March 1994:    1. That after having completed initial investigations and  judicial proceedings, it is evident that certain residents of  San Cristobal Verapaz acted criminally and very seriously  injured U.S. citizen (June Diane Weinstock), who was in that  region as a tourist.    They also seriously injured the judge, officials,  administrative justice of the peace personnel, and members of  the national media, the Red Cross, the Firefighters Corps, and  public force personnel stationed in that region. In addition,  judicial files were damaged. This has undoubtedly undermined the  interests and human rights of hundreds of people who have been  or are being prosecuted in that jurisdiction.    2. The Guatemalan Government, based on the spontaneous  testimony of countless residents of that place, recognizes the  innocence and honorability of the U.S. citizen, who was brutally  attacked, and assumes responsiblity for the medical attention  that her situation may require. The same treatment will be  granted to fellow citizens whose condition warrants it. The  government vigorously condemns this violent act.    3. The action of these groups is reflected in the  dissemination of unfounded rumors and appearance of graffiti  [legendas] in the country's towns and highways that link  innocent U.S. citizens to the stealing of and trafficking in  minors. The apparent goal of this is to create an atmosphere of  insecurity and instability in the country.    4. This provocation seeks to jeopardize Guatemala's  relations with friendly nations.    5. The government appeals to the public, urging people  not to be deceived by the propagation of groundless rumors and  the manipulation of inexact and biased information aimed at  creating an atmosphere of social unrest. It states that it will  not tolerate individual or group actions perpetrated with the  intention of taking the law into their own hands. It pledges to  strictly enforce existing laws against those who commit these  crimes.</p>

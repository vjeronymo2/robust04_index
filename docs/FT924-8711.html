			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / Osman makes ninth freedom appeal FRESH evidence has come to light undermining the decision to extradite fugitive banker Mr Lorrain Osman to Hong Kong to face multi-million-dollar theft and fraud charges, the High Court was told today. Mr Osman, 60, Britain's longest-serving unconvicted prisoner, was making his ninth application in seven years for a writ of habeas corpus freeing him from custody at Brixton prison in south London. His lawyer, Mr Michael Mansfield QC, said statements incriminating him - made by a key witness and self-confessed receiver of bribes - had been in the possession of the Hong Kong government since 1984. They were only released to the defence in recent months, he said, and showed that vital evidence in the decision to extradite was 'totally worthless'. Mr Mansfield asked to seek a judicial review of the latest decision last week by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, to order his removal to Hong Kong. Mr Osman was committed in June 1987 to await extradition on 42 charges  -later reduced to 39 - of theft, corruption and conspiracy to defraud. All relate to the 1983 collapse of Carrian Investments, a shipping and property group. Mr Osman was non-executive chairman of Carrian's creditor, Bumiputra Malaysia Finance. Mr Mansfield said the case involved allegations that loans by BMFL to Carrian between 1979 and 1983 were made without proper security, involving corrupt payments and false accounting. Ibrahim Jaafar, BMFL's chief executive, providing evidence, was granted 'unusually wide immunity' from prosecution - and allowed to keep bribes, added Mr Mansfield. Mr Jaafar had claimed that Mr Osman was involved in advancing Dollars 138m in loans without adequate security. Mr Mansfield said it had emerged that, in 1984, Mr Jaafar told Hong Kong's commercial crime bureau that the loans were secured. Clive Nicholls QC, for the Hong Kong authorities, accused Mr Osman of making a 'grave and baseless' allegation. He said a fugitive was allowed to attack the good faith of a state requesting extradition. 'However, we argue there can be circumstances where the accusation itself is simply scandalous.' The hearing was adjourned until tomorrow.</p>

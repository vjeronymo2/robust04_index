			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Russian membership in the Council of Europe will  largely depend on the withdrawal of Russian troops from the  Baltic countries. It was also possible to list the other  obstacles hindering Russia's membership in the Council during a  two-day seminar in Helsinki. This is what Olli Rehn, the  chairman of the Finnish delegation to the Council of Europe,  said.    [Begin Rehn recording] Russia cannot become a member before  there is an agreement on the withdrawal of the troops. [end  recording]    [Correspondent Sinikka Siekkinen] However, Rehn said that  there are good grounds to assume that there will be agreement  between Russia and Estonia so that the Russian troops will be  withdrawn by the end of August. Latvia has also reached a  preliminary agreement with Russia on the withdrawal of the main  part of its troops. Other obstacles standing in the way of  Russian membership concern human rights and press freedom. The  rights of minorities were also discussed. [passage omitted]    Vladimir Lukin, the head of the Russian delegation,  expressed  the view that the meeting was very useful for the Russians  because many members of the delegation had very shaky  information on the Council of Europe.    [Begin Lukin recording, in English] This conference was very  useful for us, the majority of our group before this conference  (? very big) impression on what the Council of  Europe...[recording interrupted by correspondent; sentence as  received] [end recording]    [Siekkinen] According to Lukin, now that the Council of  Europe is much more familiar to them, it is easier to decide  whether to join it or not.    Lukin also acknowledged the fact that a member of the  delegation, Vladimir Zhirinovskiy, behaved better than expected  at the actual meeting, to everyone's surprise. This is what  Olli Rehn said about Zhirinovskiy's excessive media coverage.    [Begin Rehn recording] I hope that the media -- the press  and  the electronic media -- pay as much attention to the  implementation of Russia's membership in the Council of Europe  and the fact that the process is progressing, as it has done to  these extra events during this two-day seminar. These are two  matters of a completely different scale; Russia's membership in  the Council of Europe is a really important issue concerning the  security of the whole of Europe.</p>

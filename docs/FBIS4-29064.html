			<p>BFN     [Text] HONG KONG, June 15 (AFP) -- North Korea is  "prepared" for war if the United States keeps pushing for  inspections of Pyongyang's nuclear program, President Kim  Il-Song has been quoted as saying. In a meeting June 1 in  Pyongyang with King Norodom Sihanouk, the North Korean leader  also said he wanted direct negotiations with Washington to  tension on the Korean peninsula, according to the Cambodian  leader. Kim added that North Korea would not start a war with  South Korea, although it would resist if attacked, Sihanouk told  the FAR EASTERN ECONOMIC REVIEW in an interview to appear  Thursday.    "The words were not hostile at all," Sihanouk, a close  friend  of Kim who maintains a residence in Pyongyang, told the Hong  Kong-based newsweekly in Beijing. But he quoted Kim as saying  the United States, by pushing for nuclear inspections, wanted to  turn North Korea into "a man without defence secrets, just a  naked man." "We cannot accept that. We would rather accept a  war. If they decide to make war, we accept the war, the  challenge we are prepared for," Kim was quoted as saying. "They  want us to take off our shirts, our coats, and now our trousers  -- and after that, we will be nude, absolutely naked."    North Korea announced this week it was pulling out of the  International Atomic Energy Agency after resisting attempts by  the UN agency to determine if it extracted ingredients for a  nuclear bomb from its small reactor.    Sihanouk quoted Kim as saying: "The Americans know perhaps  that we have no nuclear weapons, but they want to know what is  exactly our defence system with conventional weapons." "That is  the reason they want the UN atomic agency to make inspections in  depth," Kim added.    Explaining why he took two weeks to convey Kim's remarks,  Sihanouk told the REVIEW that the North Korean leader had asked  him at the time to pass on the remarks to the king's "American  friends." "But I have had no opportunities to tell (U.S.)  officials," the monarch said. "No, I don't need to tell the  officials, as I have been telling you (the REVIEW)."</p>

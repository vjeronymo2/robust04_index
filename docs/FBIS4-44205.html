			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Daniel Bernard: "Emmanuelli Plans Congress for </F> His Coronation"]    [Excerpts] [Socialist Party, PS, First Secretary] Henri  Emmanuelli has finally achieved the impossible. After meeting  with Pierre Mauroy, Laurent Fabius, Michel Rocard, and Martine  Aubry on Tuesday [21 June] and continuing his consultations  yesterday (directly or through the eclectic Jean Glavany), the  new first secretary has managed to persuade all factions to take  part in the new PS leadership.    From the start of the national bureau meeting, the deputy  for  les Landes -- rather edgy, according to several participants --  announced the convening of an extraordinary congress scheduled  for September. Rocard's supporters, who had demanded the  announcement of such a consultation of the members, no longer  had any reason to refuse to participate in the leadership.  [passage omitted]    Although this "transitional" team is to be confirmed at the  fall congress, Henri Emmanuelli did not seem to consider his own  leadership of the party to be transitional. Of course, his  mandate will be reviewed. But he has already indicated that he  would be "the first signatory of a motion," which he already  knows will be "relatively brief." This will be an opportunity  for the PS, he said, to "regain a clear political direction"  which "only the members have the right and responsiblity" to  define. To break with the "slide from democracy" and the  "extremes" which have had the effect of "weakening the political  debate," the first secretary expressed the hope that "a majority  and minority" should emerge "in order that the party regains a  democratic rhythm."    Although he wants to make the PSF "a normal party," Henri  Emmanuelli above all wants a "boost be given to the Left," not  to stick to "the Left's traditional liturgy," but because "the  men and women of the Left no longer identify with the PS."  Until the PS has clearly established its identity on the Left,  the first secretary refused to reveal which Socialist candidate  had his preference for the presidential election. "I cannot  resign myself to placing the PS in splendid isolation. I want  the PS to live within the family of the Left," the man to whom  presidential ambitions are already being attributed, said simply!</p>

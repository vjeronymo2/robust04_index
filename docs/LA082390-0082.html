			<p><P> August 23, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESULTS OF MARGARINE STUDY DOWNPLAYED;  </P> <P> HEALTH: DUTCH RESEARCH LINKING MARGARINE WITH RAISED CHOLESTEROL LEVELS IS  UNDER ATTACK FROM U.S. INDUSTRY OFFICIALS. THEY CLAIM THE STUDY IS UNREALISTIC.  </P> <P> The nutrition community was stunned last week with the release of research  indicating that margarine -- heavily promoted as a no-cholesterol food -- may  actually contain compounds that increase potentially harmful cholesterol  levels.  </P> <P> The discovery runs counter to popularly held beliefs that margarine is a more  healthful alternative to butter because of its lower cholesterol profile.  </P> <P> The study further confuses an already bewildered public about the role of  cholesterol and fat in the diet.  </P> <P> "People are saying, 'What are we supposed to do? And what are we to believe?"'  said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute in  Washington. "The credibility of the nutrition community has really been shaken  by this."  </P> <P> The report, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, stated that trans  monounsaturated fatty acids, primarily found in margarines and shortenings,  increased low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs, by 6% in a three-week dietary  study of 59 adults.  </P> <P> Trans fatty acids are formed when vegetable oil is hydrogenated, or solidified,  to create margarine. Elevated LDL levels in blood have been linked to heart  disease.  </P> <P> Interviews with consumer advocates, food industry representatives and health  researchers in the past week revealed a general dietary consensus: moderation.  In other words, individuals at risk for heart disease should reduce their  intake of all fats including butter, margarine and oils. Those without a  cholesterol problem should continue to monitor fat intake but may still enjoy  reasonable amounts of butter or margarine.  </P> <P> "No responsible person is saying substitute butter for margarine," said Bonnie  Liebman, nutrition director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest,  a Washington-based advocacy group. "It simply is too early to jump to that  conclusion."  </P> <P> Industry representatives, representing both margarine or butter interests,  downplayed the importance of the study, saying excessive amounts of trans fatty  acids were fed to subjects and thus produced "unusual" results.  </P> <P> The researchers, Ronald P. Mensink, Ph.D., and Martijn B. Katan, Ph.D.,  conducted the project at the Agricultural University in Wageningen, the  Netherlands.  </P> <P> Their findings also showed that trans fatty acids may even reduce the presence  of beneficial high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs, which act to purge the blood  stream of harmful compounds.  </P> <P> The Dutch researchers' work demonstrated that the increases in cholesterol  levels caused by trans fatty acids parallel those detected in subjects fed  diets heavy in saturated fats.  </P> <P> The study found that LDL levels increased 12% among participants fed a  saturated fat diet during the project.  </P> <P> "For the time being, it would seem prudent for patients at increased risk of  atherosclerosis to avoid a high intake of trans fatty acids," the researchers  stated.  </P> <P> Theoretically, the dairy industry should be celebrating news that margarine's  ingredients may raise cholesterol levels, therefore better positioning butter  in the nutrition world. Not so.  </P> <P> "This is not a renaissance for butter. No, it would not be fair to the public  to say that," said Sharon Long, director of communications for the Dairy  Council of California, a nutrition education organization in Sacramento. "We  never thought that margarine was sacred or oil was sacred or butter was sacred.  All fats should be moderated in the diet."  </P> <P> Critics of the Mensink and Katan study have also surfaced in the days since the  report was published.  </P> <P> "There is no cause for alarm," said David Kritchevsky, associate director of  the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia. "Generally speaking, the amount they fed  the subjects was four times the average American intake (of trans fatty acids),  so you would expect to see an increase in LDL. If they had fed the people  normal amounts, then nothing would have happened."  </P> <P> The St. Louis-based American Soybean Assn. also took issue with the types of  food served in the Dutch study. (About 75% of all margarine produced in this  country is made from soybean oil.)  </P> <P> "The (meals) were completely inconsistent with what Americans eat," said Gunnar  Lynum, the association's marketing vice president. "Even so, the changes they  recorded are not that great. (The trans fatty acid) did increase cholesterol  levels, but not by as much as when the subjects were fed saturated fat . . . .  I don't think this is a setback for margarine."  </P> <P> A representative of the National Assn. of Margarine Manufactures in Washington  reported no sales declines among members in the well-publicized study's  aftermath.  </P> <P> Richard Cristol, the association's executive director, said the margarine-like  food used in the Dutch study was chemically different than the product sold in  this country. He emphasized that butter still contains more saturated fat, a  known dietary evil, than does margarine.  </P> <P> "There are two grams of saturated fat in (a tablespoon of) margarine; even less  in vegetable oil spreads," he said. "There are seven grams of saturated fat in  (a similar serving of) butter. . . . Margarine remains a healthful alternative  to butter."  </P> <P> The study does present an interesting dilemma for the fast food industry. Many  chains recently announced that they would fry foods, particularly French fries,  in vegetable oils rather than beef fat.  </P> <P> Leonard, of the Community Nutrition Institute, said that the change may  actually increase the amount of fat present on these foods.  </P> <P> Potatoes are more likely to absorb the vegetable fat, and its trans fatty  acids, than animal fat, which had previously been used, he said.  </P> <P> The Center for Science's Liebman said it was too soon to know whether trans  fatty acids pose a problem with fast foods.  </P> <P> "We don't know the exact composition of the oils used in frying (by the  chains). You can't assume that all hydrogenated oils are worse than beef fat,"  she said.  </P></p>

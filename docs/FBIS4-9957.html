			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Raul Sanchez Carrillo from the "Early Morning" </F> newscast]    [Text] Now, we are at the Political Council of the National  Executive Committee of the Institutional Revolutionary Party  [PRI]. Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza was sworn in as secretary general  of the PRI National Executive Committee a few minutes ago.  Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, who was former governor of Mexico  State, will replace Jose Luis La Madrid Sauza, who resigned  yesterday to accept the post of campaign coordinator for PRI  presidential candidate Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon.    Here at the Political Council, headed by Fernando Ortiz  Arana  as president of the National Executive Committee of the PRI, the  election of Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza was unanimous.  Representatives of the three groups that make up the party  brought him to this room where the event is being held.    Currently, an agreement is being read which states that on  orders from the candidate, Zedillo Ponce de Leon, himself, the  mourning for the death of Luis Donaldo Colosio, who was cowardly  assassinated, will be perpetuated within the party. His  political ideology will be respected and fulfilled so as to  strengthen the new presidential candidate.</p>

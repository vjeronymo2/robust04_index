			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Weak demand hurts Monsanto MONSANTO, the US chemicals group, yesterday posted underlying fourth-quarter profits which tumbled to Dollars 12m from Dollars 51m, but the company's balance sheet was cluttered with special items which brought net income to Dollars 141m, or Dollars 1.14 a share. Mr Richard Mahoney, chairman and chief executive, said: 'Undeniably, 1992 was a difficult year in which to operate.' The company has been hit by low prices and weak demand for chemicals and by a poor performance by its Searle pharmaceutical business. During the 1992 quarter, Monsanto took an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 425m, or Dollars 3.44 a share. This was more than offset by a gain of Dollars 554m, or Dollars 4.49, from the sale of its Fisher Controls unit. A year earlier, Monsanto had net income of Dollars 66m, or 53 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.89bn. Earnings included Dollars 15m from Fisher Controls. Sales in the 1992 quarter slipped 1.6 per cent to Dollars 1.86bn, while the cost of goods sold rose 12.5 per cent to Dollars 1.26bn, leaving Monsanto with a 21.6 per cent decline in gross profit to Dollars 603m from Dollars 769m. For the full year, Monsanto had a net loss of Dollars 88m, or 71 cents, on sales of Dollars 7.8bn, against net earnings of Dollars 296m, or Dollars 2.33, on revenues of Dollars 7.9bn. In 1992, Monsanto adopted new accounting standards for a cumulative charge Dollars 540m. Income was further reduced by special charges of Dollars 47m. Restructuring charges in 1991 reduced after-tax earnings by Dollars 325m, or Dollars 2.54. Monsanto, which is cutting about 3,200 jobs, mainly at Searle, said Searle's underlying operating income fell in the quarter after stripping out charges of Dollars 265m for cost cutting. The company said underlying operating income for its agricultural group increased significantly in the fourth quarter, led by improved sales of its Roundup herbicide. Underlying operating profits from its chemical group declined in the latest quarter, reflecting weak industrial demand and disappointing prices and sales volumes in Europe. On Wall Street, shares in Monsanto rose Dollars  7/8 to close at Dollars 53 1/8.</p>

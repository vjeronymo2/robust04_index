			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Observer: Reading list When Bill Clinton popped into Blackwells bookshop in Oxford last week, only five minutes before closing time, he obviously knew what he was looking for. Hamish McRae's The World in 2020, about 'power, culture and prosperity - a vision of the future', is typical presidential reading material. David Selbourne's The Principles of Duty, billed as a 'powerful criticism of the corrupted liberal order', sounds equally worthy. But wasn't Selbourne the maverick left-wing don who upset the left by writing for The Times when the unions were up in arms against Rupert Murdoch's plans for the paper? He was so hated that he was drummed out of Oxford. Peter Arnett's memoirs of a hack who has covered every recent war from Vietnam to Kuwait also looks a bit of an odd choice. Could Clinton be planning how to survive a siege conducted by liberals who fear a sell-out?</p>

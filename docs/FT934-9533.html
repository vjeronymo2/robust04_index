			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Norwegian tanker group for market valued at Pounds 212m BONA Shipholding, a company set up to run the tanker interests of Norwegian shipping group Leif Hoegh, plans a stock market listing which will raise Dollars 120m of new capital and value the company at about Dollars 320m (Pounds 212m). Bona, a Bermuda-registered company which was set up last year, already has interests in 12 oil-bulk-ore vessels, tankers and product carriers and has placed orders and options for a further three tankers. It plans to issue between 11m and 15m new shares at about Dollars 10-Dollars 12 a share in a move which would reduce Leif Hoegh's stake from 76 per cent to about 42 per cent. A pathfinder prospectus is to be issued at the end of November with pricing likely to follow in the second week of December. The Bona issue will be the sixth share offering to be announced by a shipping company in the past six months and signals a reawakening of investor interest in the sector, said Mr David Freud, a director of SG Warburg, which is handling the listing and share offer. Warburg will offer 85 per cent of the new shares to international investors while the remainder will be offered in Norway by Den norske Bank. The shares will be listed on the Oslo stock exchange and also traded in London and in the US to qualified institutions under Rule 144A. More than half of the world's tanker fleet is more than 15 years old and tougher safety standards could lead to many more vessels being scrapped over the next few years. By separating its tanker interests from its other activities Leif Hoegh will avoid distorting its balance sheet and will distance itself from the risks inherent in far tougher environmental legislation introduced in the US in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Bona's chairman is Mr Rudolph Agnew, who is also chairman of TVS and a former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields. Mr John Smadal, a former president of Leif Hoegh, is chief executive.</p>

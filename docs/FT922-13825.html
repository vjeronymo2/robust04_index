			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Imro 'thumped' over Maxwell IMRO, WHICH regulates the fund management industry, has told members that it will re-examine its supervisory arrangements and priorities in the wake of the Maxwell pensions affair. In a letter to members it said it had been 'thumped' when it gave evidence before the Commons social security committee. 'We cannot claim to have come out of this very well: to an extent Imro was thumped, and that is not an agreeable experience,' it says. The regulatory body said it would look at companies with complex structures leading to tax havens in case things are 'a little too convenient'. However, Imro believes there was no sustainable reason for refusing membership to Maxwell companies. In the case of the Maxwell affair, it says the whole system failed. Imro says it does not wish to deny that part of the responsibility 'that is properly ours'. It concludes: 'In the Maxwell case such vigilance was notably absent: not one of those with a professional or personal interest - or duty - made any attempt to alert the regulator'.</p>

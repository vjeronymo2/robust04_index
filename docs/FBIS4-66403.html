			<p>CSO     [Text] By the end of this year, major foreign and domestic  LSI manufacturers are expected to ship samples of 64M DRAM  devices in order to give companies a chance to evaluate the  electrical characteristics of the chips. Due to a strong  insistence on lower cost, domestic makers say they will reverse  the trend of using more masks to using less masks in the first  generation of 64M chips. LSI manufacturers have narrowed down  the types of transistors used. The sample chip is meant to be a  "probe chip" that will be used to absorb demand in the  marketplace. The word configuration will switch from the x1, x4  configuration used through the first generation of 16M chips to  an x8, x16 configuration for the first time, and companies will  try to consolidate this even further in the second generation  chips. In order to keep producing chips with existing equipment,  most of the chips are 200mm[.sup]2[/] or larger in size, or  one and one-half times the size of 16M devices. For that reason,  the second generation chips might be available as early as 1995,  and be 150-160mm[.sup]2[/] in size.    A survey of major LSI manufacturers indicates that companies  have begun shipping the first full-scale shipments of 64M DRAM  devices in order to let users evaluate the electrical  characteristics of the chips. Following on the heels of four  companies who have already started shipping, another five  companies plan to begin shipping by the end of the  year.[.sup](1)[/] Including both joint ventures and Korean  companies, that figure could quadruple in three years' time.  Most manufacturers plan to have their chips out by the first  half of 1994.  <H5>  Changing Role </H5>   The biggest difference between these chips and the 16M DRAM  chips is the change from using more DRAM masks to using fewer  masks. The first generation of chips is clearly moving toward  the role of being a "probe chip" in order to absorb some of the  demand in the market.    LSI manufacturers have been able to keep the number of masks  to around 20, which is the same as the first generation of 4M  chips, and by using existing production lines to produce the  first generation of probe chips, they have been able to avoid  the large investment in new equipment. Therefore, the greater  portion of 64M DRAM chips are 200mm[.sup]2[/] or larger in  size, or one and one-half times the size of 16M devices.    In terms of specifications, instead of the x1, x4 word  configuration that were found throughout the first generation of  16M chips, many of the new 64M chips have switched for the first  time to not only x4 word configurations, but also x8 and x16  configurations (cf. Table 1). Most manufacturers aim to supply  high-speed versions with access times starting initially from 50  ns. There is a dispute among companies over whether to give the  chips a synchronous feature in order to achieve faster data  transmission.       Table 1.

Companies  are planning to have the second generation of chips available as  early as 1995. By that time, most chips will have the  synchronous feature.       Table 1.

[.sup]*1[/]: Estimate made by Nikkei Microdevices; Hitachi and Texas Instruments refused to make any comments before announcement in December.  The technology used by IBM (US)-Siemens AG (Ger) is discussed in more detail starting on page 38.    <H5>  Five More Companies To Ship by Year's End </H5>   NEC announced in March of this year that it had already  shipped samples of the 64M DRAM to users before any other  company so that it could give its users the opportunity to  evaluate features and performance. At the start of February, it  delivered samples of the chip to major users in the United  States.    One week after that, Samsung Electronics of South Korea also  began distributing samples to its users. In the fourth quarter  of 1993, IBM (US) and Siemens AG (Germany) also started shipping  jointly-developed 64M DRAM devices.    Following on the heels of those four companies, three other  companies, namely, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric, and Hyundai  Electronics (S. Korea), are planning to start shipping by the  end of the year, and there is a strong likelihood, though it  might be behind schedule, that Hitachi and Texas Instruments  (US) will also start shipping a jointly-developed 64M chip in  December.    Fujitsu is scheduled to start shipping in the second quarter  of 1994 after making a number of design changes. Oki Electric,  Gold Star Electronics (S. Korea), and Micron Semiconductor (US)  have also made it known that they plan to start shipping by the  end of 1994.    NEC and Samsung (S. Korea), who are now in the midst of  shipping samples, are reported to have confirmed full-bit  operations in their chips, which is an indicator as to how far  along the chips are in terms of being technically complete.  Toshiba, Mitsubishi, Oki Electric, and others are making claims  about the level of completion of their chips as well, which are  reported to be nearing full-bit operations.  <H5>  Reducing Number of Masks to First Generation 4M DRAM Level </H5>   In developing the 64M chip, most of the manufacturers  including Toshiba, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu, and Mitsubishi gave  priority to reducing cost. As a result, many indicated the fact  that they had reduced the number of masks, which is an indicator  of fewer processes used to produce a particular chip, to the  same mask count used in the first generation of 4M devices.    The mask count prior to this had been on a steady upswing  (cf. Figure 2). There were many companies like NEC who said that  this was due to the cost of chips being allowed to rise until  the 16M generation chips were developed. Most manufacturers like  Mitsubishi say they recognize the advantage of stressing  performance and containing cost.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Reducing Number of Masks to 4M First Generation  Level. This is a graph showing the shift in number of masks used  by large domestic and foreign DRAM manufacturers. In the 1M  generation of DRAM devices, companies turned to CMOS to reduce  power, whereas in the 4M generation, they used two-layer  aluminum wiring to make the chips faster, and used  three-dimensional cells to ensure reliability, and in the 16M  generation, increased the number of masks due to the increase in  transistor types to make the chips faster. A portion of this  information includes estimates made by Nikkei  Microdevices.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Fujitsu reported that its aim in developing the first  generation 64M DRAM, which was re-examined in light of such  problems, and the second generation of 16M chips, which it  developed at the same time, was, needless to say, attaching  highest priority to reducing cost. Toshiba said that it had  reversed its earlier policy of putting performance first and  cost second, and Hitachi also like many others voiced concern  over cost.  <H5>  Transistor Types Reduced To Lower Mask Count </H5>   As a result of fewer transistor types, LSI manufacturers  only  had to use around 20 masks to produce the 64M chip, which was 20  percent less than that used in the first generation of 16M  chips, and the same number used in the first generation of 4M  chips.    NEC officials said that reducing the types of transistors  was  the most effective way to cut down on the number of masks. Most  domestic manufacturers eliminated the transistors in the 64M  DRAM that were used to increase speed in the first generation of  16M devices. Companies have also been turning to ion  implantation to control threshold voltage. Another way to reduce  the number of masks is by implanting ions in the n[.sup]-[/]  region of the nMOS, and compensating for the n[.sup]-[/]  created pMOS when building in p[.sup]+[/]. This enables a  further reduction of two to four masks.    The areas in which transistors have performed poorly were  resolved by changing the circuit and array configurations,  thereby giving the 64M chip a faster access time than the 16M.  This is because chip manufacturers were able to get the chips to  work reliably with less of a margin allowed for transistor  performance.    Mitsubishi and Samsung also reduced the number of masks  using  a high-energy ion implantation technique. Mitsubishi, which has  been using that technology since 16M chips, continued using that  technology in 64M devices, achieving a reduction in the number  of masks by two compared to if the technology had not been used.  Though it has not specified the number of masks used, Samsung  decided to start using this technique with the 64M generation of  chips as a way of being able to make a 10 percent reduction in  the manufacturing costs and number of processes.    Though the number of masks remains the same, there are ways  to reduce the number of processes including: (a) using tungsten  in the wiring, (b) using a doped poly-Si in which impurities are  mixed into the film, and (c) an aluminum reflow method.    There are a growing number of companies who have adopted the  first of these methods. Hitachi applied this method in its 16M  devices, and Fujitsu and Oki Electric used it for the first time  in the first generation 64M chips. NEC is also looking to use  this method in its second generation of 64M chips. The first  method, which changes the wiring configuration from a two-layer  aluminum to a one-layer aluminum/one-layer tungsten, eliminates  the etching process after tungsten is embedded, which is quite  costly in terms of equipment. The second method effectively  eliminates the P diffusion process. This method can be applied  to processes that use poly-Si for bit lines and contacts. This  method also seems to be particularly effective in terms of  characteristics when poly-Si is embedded for holes. This is  because P does not diffuse to the bottom of the holes after  being embedded. Mitsubishi, which partially adopted this method  in 16M devices, increased use of this process in its 64M chips.  Both NEC and Hitachi have this method under study. Samsung has  been using the third method (c) since its 4M chips, and is also  considering using this method again in its 64M chips.  <H5>  Applications Expected in Servers and Engineering Work </H5> Stations    The area that gives design specialists the biggest headache  is what type of specifications to incorporate in the initial  chips. Before a market can be created, a demand must be  forecast, and even if the technology has been perfected, it is  still hard to create a market. For example, the work that went  into promoting the 4M generation of chips even after the bit  price was lowered is quite indicative of the market demand in  the initial stages for multi-bit versions for PCs.    Companies are using the 64M samples as "probe chips" in  order  to investigate for what systems the chips might be used. For  that reason, most companies are using a different strategy than  before and, like Mitsubishi, have given the sample chips a  diverse range of features and will nail down specific features  in later versions of first generation and second generation  chips. For example, the areas corresponding to multi-bit  configurations are different from the 16M chips in terms of  specifications. This is due to the size of the chip, which is  200mm[.sup]2[/], and to the chip's position being changed.  Because this chip is not directly linked to a particular use, it  was designed, according to NEC, on the condition that it be  manufactured with existing equipment and technologies rather  than reinvesting in new equipment.    The reason behind the chip's position being changed had to  do  first with the fact that the market, which had been fairly  reliable when it came to mainframes, was becoming somewhat  unpredictable, and systems such as servers, engineering work  stations, and high-performance PCs that would use 64M chips,  were becoming more diversified (cf. Figure 3). The first areas  in which the 16M chips were used was in memory cards and  mid-size computers. In fact, NEC has said that it has already  gotten requests from two domestic and two foreign companies who  want to use the 64M samples in servers. NEC also reported a  strong demand from makers of large 10-gigabyte semiconductor  disks who want to use the chips to replace slower hard disks.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Uses of 64M DRAM Devices. Immediate uses for the  chips include 1G-2G-byte range engineering work stations and  servers, and 10G-byte range mainframe computers. In other areas,  Mitsubishi believes from the view of packaging that these chips  will quickly be put to use in high-end portable electronic  information equipment. Data furnished by Mitsubishi  Electric.&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  Multi-Bit Chips From Outset </H5>   The specifications of the initial samples show that the word  configuration has been widened. Portable data processing  equipment requires multi-bit configurations of x16 or more, and  engineering work stations and PCs require x8 configurations  because of expanded memories. Meanwhile, large computers such as  mainframes require x4 configurations. A total of 13 companies  have designed their chips with x8 configurations, and eight  companies have included x16 configurations. Seven companies,  meanwhile, do not have a x1 configuration. The word  configurations favored in the first generation of chips are x4,  x8, and x16, but this will be narrowed down further in other  first and second generation versions.[.sup](2)[/]    The area in which there is some debate is over whether the  chips should have a synchronous feature. Companies are planning  to include this feature in second generation chips, but are  divided in terms of the first generation. Fujitsu decided, based  on strong requests made inside and outside the company, that  this function was essential in engineering work stations, and  knowing that it will be late in shipping the chips, has been  putting a lot of energy into changing the design. Toshiba and  Oki Electric will have this function in later first generation  versions. Meanwhile, NEC, Mitsubishi, IBM-Siemens, and Micron  Semiconductor plan to offer this function in second generation  versions, and for the first generation, plan instead to offer an  extended data output feature with an upgraded page mode to do  high-speed data transmission. Manufacturers, such as NEC, have  decided that an interleave type memory configuration used in  high-capacity chips was not necessary initially for the  high-performance systems that will adopt the 64M chip.    Most of the 64M samples have access times of 50 ns, and  cycle  times of 90 ns. All companies surveyed reported using a 500 mil  wide package. The CBR[.sup](3)[/] method, which emerged as  the favored refresh method among users of 16M chips, has emerged  in the standard specifications of 64M chips. A major portion of  companies are adopting the CBR format for both extended memories  and SIMM, and have said that the number of refresh cycles will  be decided after consultation with users.    The first generation 16M DRAM is between  200-220mm[.sup]2[/] in size, or 1.5 times larger than the  first generation 16M chips, thus, all companies are scrambling  to develop a second generation chip. NEC says it is planning to  start shipping a second generation chip as early as 1995 (cf.  Figure 4). The second generation version will be  150-160mm[.sup]2[/] in size, have a design rule between  0.32-0.30, and be placed in a 400-mil package. The 16M  versions featuring a synchronous function that most companies  plan to offer in the second generation of chips will be divided  into those with two-bank and four-bank  configurations.[.sup](4)[/]  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 4. More Than 1.5 Times Larger Than 16M DRAM. The  64M chips is more than 200mm[.sup]2[/] in size, which is more  than 1.5 times larger than 16M devices. The first generation of  chips was manufactured without any new major investment in  equipment because companies could use existing production lines  to manufacture the chips.&lt;/graphic&gt;   Footnotes    1. Here, the number of companies participating in a joint  development of two companies is counted as two. The four  companies that have shipped chips already include NEC-Samsung  (S. Korea), and the IBM-Siemens groups. The companies that are  planning to ship by December include Toshiba, Mitsubishi  Electric, and Hyundai Electronics (S. Korea). There is a high  probability also that the Hitachi-Texas Instruments group will  also ship by December. That brings to nine the total number of  companies. Up to the 16M generation of chips, a cooperative  relationship existed between Gold Star Electronics and Hitachi  in which the former supplied the latter with OEM. The same type  of relation existed between Fujitsu and Hyundai Electronics in  manufacturing, but it is uncertain at the present time whether  that or the other relationships will continue in the 64M  generation of chips.    2. There is general negativity among companies when it comes  to parity bits such as x9 and x18. This is because it is hard to  find any cost advantages.    3. CBR stands for CAS before RAS refresh.    4. The reason that it is separated into a two-bank and  four-bank system is because the four-bank system effectively  improves the bit rate of the cache memory assuming the load  capacity of the system is not more than four times, but there is  a tradeoff relationship between the area of the chip and how  much money is spent on tests. Going from a two-bank to a  four-bank system increases costs by about 5 percent, so NEC and  others selected the two-bank system. Fujitsu, meanwhile, which  had started with a synchronous feature in the first generation  of chips, went with a four-bank configuration due to user  demands.</p>

			<p><P> February 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST: LONG BEACH;  </P> <P> LEGISLATURE URGED TO BAN SALE OF ASSAULT WEAPONS  </P> <P> Alarmed at the recent rash of publicized shootings involving assault rifles,  the Long Beach City Council has decided to let one of its committees study  whether more can be done to control the high-powered weapons.  </P> <P> Council members also passed a resolution calling on the Legislature to ban the  sale of military-style semiautomatic assault rifles.  </P> <P> "There is no legitimate use for these weapons," said Councilman Evan Anderson  Braude, who sponsored the actions.  </P> <P> "This is madness and it has got to stop," said Councilman Clarence Smith.  </P> <P> But gun advocate Clark Biggers III said that he objected to an attempt by the  city to control the sale of assault rifles. He said that youths learn to shoot  the weapons, giving them valuable experience that they can apply if called for  duty in the military. Also, he said their familiarity with the  Russian-designed, Chinese-manufactured AK-47 could prove valuable if they have  to use an enemy weapon in combat.  </P></p>

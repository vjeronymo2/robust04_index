			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Basic image Sir, Whenever I hear the phrase 'Back to Basics' I think of the current Tesco low pricing promotion also called 'Basics'. An image of Prime Minister John Major standing in front of 10 Downing Street holding up a Tesco carrier bag pops into my brain. It seems to me that both are attempts to obtain short-term advantage using a range of items that the public believes are fundamental. The difference between them is that the promotion is more plausible in the case of the retailer than in the case of the government.

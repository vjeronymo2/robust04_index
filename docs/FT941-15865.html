			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Lloyd's offer is rejected by Merrett Names Leaders of nearly 2,000 loss-making Merrett Names at Lloyd's yesterday said they were unable to accept a settlement offer designed to bring an end to legal action involving 17,000 of the individual members whose capital supports the insurance market. The Merrett Names, whose losses relate to the 1985 underwriting year, are one of the three biggest groups of lossmakers at the market, which has been rocked by losses of more than Pounds 6bn in the past five years. Two other groups - the Gooda Walker and Feltrim Names - will meet next week to discuss their position on the offer, which Names must decide to accept or reject by February 14. Mr John Mays, deputy chairman of the Merrett Names' Association, described the settlement document as 'one-sided' and the offer a 'small pittance'. He said the group would continue its legal fight 'both for justice and to change the culture of Lloyd's'. Names wishing to accept the deal must resign from the association. The settlement, which was announced last month, offers Merrett Names only Pounds 44.07m in compensation while losses incurred to date exceed Pounds 135m. The association expects losses eventually to reach Pounds 765.06m and said the deal was worth less than 6p in the pound to its members. Merrett syndicate 418, which has now ceased to underwrite, is unable to close its accounts for the 1985 year because of uncertainty over the scale of liability claims, many of which are from US asbestosis and pollution cases. Mr Ken Lavery, chairman, told an association meeting that 673 of the 925 Merrett Names, responding to a survey conducted by the association, would either reject or were inclined to reject the settlement offer. He added that only 164 of those replying leaned towards an acceptance of the Lloyd's deal. However, opinion at yesterday's meeting, which was attended by more than 300 Names, appeared to be more balanced. In a short debate four Names spoke in favour of the settlement compared with two against. Following angry scenes at the meeting, the association's leaders said they were unlikely to insist on a rule requiring resigning members to pay to the association a fee equivalent to 6 per cent of their 'line' - the amount of premiums they underwrote - on syndicate 418. Mr Charles Baron, a committee member, said: 'This meeting has shown how divided we all are. Whatever the figures are that have been mentioned here, I can't see myself sending you a writ to collect it.' The group's legal action against agents and auditors is expected to come to court early next year. Separately, Merrett Names were urged to lend their support to a call by action group leaders to hold a further extraordinary general meeting aimed at overturning changes to Lloyd's voting rules which were introduced last month. Lloyd's wants to move from a one-member-one-vote system towards one in which voting power would be proportionate to the amount of capital Names' commit. The action groups claim the rules will give Names active in 1994 - including new corporate members - power to call levies on individual Names in relation to losses incurred in 1993 and prior years.</p>

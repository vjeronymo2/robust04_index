			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark declines in Europe THE D-Mark weakened against most European currencies yesterday amid fears over the consequences of potential unrest in the former Soviet Union and a general correction of the optimistic buying in recent weeks. Economists suggested that traders who had expected some sort of ERM action - such as realignment - over the holidays were unwinding long positions on the D-Mark. The German currency's weakness was most notable against those countries which have raised rates in line with the Bundesbank's move on December 19, said one senior dealer. The peseta had a particularly strong run, and tested its ceiling against sterling, the weakest ERM currency. Traders speculated that the Bank of Spain had intervened to pull the peseta back. The Spanish currency closed higher at Pta 63.43 per D-Mark, compared with Pta 63.61. The French Franc reached its strongest level since October at one stage, quoting FFr3.4135 against the D-Mark. The French currency closed in London at FFr3.4132 per D-Mark, up from FFr3.4149. Sterling still languished at the bottom of the ERM grid, although the D-Mark's weakness has taken some of the pressure off British authorities to raise interest rates for the moment. 'Sterling has finished the week on a stronger note  .. than most people would have imagined on the Monday before new year's,' said Mr David Dean, assistant chief dealer at Barclays. The UK currency was buoyed both by the D-Mark's weakness and the comments made on Thursday by Bank of England governor, Mr Robin Leigh Pemberton reiterating government statements that there was no immediate need to raise rates. Sterling closed in the mid-range in London yesterday at DM2.8575. Dealers were cautious over the prospects for sterling, as most of the big market players were still on holiday. Some dealers suggested that sterling had taken some of its shine from the dollar's steady recovery against the D-Mark. The US currency has gained two pfennigs in two days and last night closed at the day's high of DM1.5465. The dollar also gained early ground at the expense of the yen, climbing to Y125 by midday and finishing at Y124.85, compared with Y124.55 on Thursday. The dollar is expected to make further gains next week. Both Mr Bush's visit to Tokyo and the absence of further depressing economic figures - at least until the US employment report on Friday - are expected to boost the dollar. The Argentine austral has been redenominated as the peso. One peso - equivalent to 10,000 australs - is now equal to one US dollar.</p>

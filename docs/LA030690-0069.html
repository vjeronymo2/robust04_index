			<p><P> March 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRADLEY, OTHERS DO AN ABOUT-FACE IN WAVING ANTI-MALATHION BANNER;  </P> <P> NEWS ANALYSIS  </P> <P> Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley joined the anti-malathion battle just two weeks  ago -- later than many critics, but with a stand that undoubtedly pleased the  growing movement against aerial spraying.  </P> <P> "Malathion," the mayor proclaimed in a press release, "is a matter of great  concern. I strongly feel the state must prove to us that the Medfly spraying is  safe."  </P> <P> Nine years ago, however, as a Medfly infestation spread throughout portions of  Northern California, Bradley, then in the midst of his 1981 gubernatorial  campaign, took a far different stand. Citing a "preponderance of opinion that  there was no health hazard," Bradley declared he had "come down on the side of  immediate spraying."  </P> <P> Not content with lending only moral support to the cause, the mayor volunteered  the use of city helicopters to spray pesticide over Southern California, which  had a small Medfly outbreak at the same time as the 1980-82 Northern California  infestation.  </P> <P> The mayor is not alone in changing his mind.  </P> <P> Legislators who once clamored for Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. to save the state's  agriculture industry with immediate malathion spraying have become some of  today's most vocal leaders in trying to stop the state's malathion assault on  the Medfly.  </P> <P> Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda), for example, voted for a resolution in  1981 demanding immediate spraying to fend off the threatened Medfly disaster.  This year, Katz authored his own resolution demanding just the opposite.  </P> <P> Some of the politicians who switched positions said they did so because they  have learned more with the passage of time or they believe the state should  develop less intrusive ways of combating the fly -- such as increased use of  sterile flies to breed the pests out of existence.  </P> <P> In a statement issued through his press office last week, Bradley echoed the  thoughts of others who have switched positions by explaining that much more is  known today about the health effects of malathion.  </P> <P> But over the last nine years, there have been few scientific breakthroughs to  prove or disprove the pesticide's safety. In fact, today's heated debate over  malathion's possible link to cancer or the efficiency of aerial spraying  against the Medfly is lifted almost verbatim from the crisis nine years ago.  </P> <P> Brown warned then, just as many officials have warned today, that even if there  is only a sliver of doubt, the public health must come first in any decision  concerning aerial spraying.  </P> <P> Some of the most controversial figures of the time also have surfaced again  this year, raising essentially the same arguments. For example, health  officials Marc Lappe and Melvin Reuber stunned state officials in 1981 with  their attacks against state and federal reports that gave the pesticide a clean  bill of health.  </P> <P> Both Lappe and Reuber have spoken out again this year, arousing the same  controversy as before.  </P> <P> So what has changed?  </P> <P> After four straight years of malathion spraying in Southern California, public  opinion has made a sharp turn, indicated by recent polls and the widespread  outcry that had not developed during previous infestations in Southern  California. The change in public opinion has not escaped notice in City Hall or  Sacramento.  </P> <P> Also, many of these politicians represent areas that were only minimally  affected by earlier sprayings and are now finding themselves increasingly under  fire by constituents whose homes have been sprayed repeatedly.  </P> <P> Gubernatorial politics also played a much larger role in the 1981 Medfly  battle.  </P> <P> Bradley's outspoken support of spraying barely drew a complaint nine years ago.  The major exception was his gubernatorial opponent, George Deukmejian, who  battled mightily to outdo his opponent for the crucial farm vote.  </P> <P> "You know George Deukmejian is not a fair-weather farmer," he said in a 1981  campaign speech from heart of the farm-rich San Joaquin Valley. "You know I  have been your friend for two decades. . . . And you know that when I give you  my word I don't owe one single thing to the labor bosses and the environmental  activists that surround Tom Bradley."  </P> <P> This year, both Bradley and Deukmejian have kept a low profile on the spraying  issue and have said little on the topic until recently, although Deukmejian has  remained committed to the program. Gubernatorial candidates Republican Pete  Wilson and Democrats Dianne Feinstein and John K. Van de Kamp have yet to  embrace aerial spraying as a campaign issue, although Van de Kamp, as attorney  general, has called for a study of whether malathion should be more heavily  regulated.  </P> <P> The issue of aerial spraying has been a tough one for legislators.  </P> <P> In 1981, 86 state legislators voted in favor of Assembly and Senate resolutions  demanding that Brown start aerial spraying. Supporters of the resolutions  included Katz, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles), Assemblyman Richard L.  Mountjoy (R-Monrovia), all 14 Senate representatives from Los Angeles and  Orange counties voting that day and 16 of 24 local Assembly members who cast  votes on the issue.  </P> <P> Roberti also voted in favor of a Senate bill that would have forced Brown to  start aerial spraying. The measure was unanimously passed.  </P> <P> In the current debate, Katz, Roberti and Mountjoy have taken visible roles in  the battle to stop malathion spraying over Southern California.  </P> <P> Although many of the legislative seats have changed hands since the 1981 Medfly  debate, already 21 of 55 Los Angeles and Orange County lawmakers have signed  letters, supported resolutions or joined lawsuits against malathion spraying.  </P> <P> Mountjoy and Katz signed a highly publicized protest letter against spraying  that was sent to the governor last week. "The health of over a million  Californians is just too important for you to continue this 'spray now, ask  questions later' policy," the letter stated.  </P> <P> Katz and Roberti also are party to a lawsuit filed against the state by the  Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group, aimed at stopping  aerial pesticide spraying over urban areas.  </P> <P> Roberti said in an interview last week that he supported spraying in 1981  because he believed it was the only way at the time to eradicate the Medfly. He  said he has changed his mind because the state has had nine years to develop  alternative strategies, such as greater use of sterile flies, but has done  little.  </P> <P> "It was a proper vote," he said. "What was reasonable then is not reasonable  now. At this point, the concerns about public health outweigh anything else."  </P> <P> Katz was more apologetic for his earlier vote, saying that he was naive nine  years ago and has learned to be more skeptical of state policies.  </P> <P> "If we could all go back, we'd all do things differently," he said. "You hope  you learn to do better next time. In 10 years, I've learned to ask more  questions and not trust the experts."  </P> <P> A few legislators have stood their ground, in particular, Sen. Art Torres  (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles).  </P> <P> Both legislators cast votes against malathion spraying in 1981 and have become  two of the most vocal leaders in the current battle to stop spraying.  </P> <P> The position adopted by Torres and Roos was not a popular one at the time.  Newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, editorialized in 1981 by decrying  the hysteria over spraying in Northern California and blaming it on "some  particularly rabid environmentalists, abetted by irresponsible or ill-informed  local politicians."  </P> <P> Last week, The Times applauded news of the formation of a state health advisory  committee to review scientific studies on malathion.  </P></p>

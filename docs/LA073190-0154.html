			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EPA UNVEILS AIR CONTROLS FOR L.A. BASIN  </P> <P> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency today unveiled new air-pollution  controls for the smoggy Los Angeles Basin and warned that "no-drive days" may  be imposed on commuters if the region fails to meet federal clean-air standards  on schedule.  </P> <P> But, even as the EPA took the wraps off its long-awaited plan to bolster local  and state air pollution control efforts, environmentalists charged that the  federal proposal accomplishes less and takes longer.  </P> <P> "We are discouraged that they propose another three years to meet the ozone  standard and four years to comply with the carbon-monoxide standard," said Jan  Chatten-Brown, president of the Venice-based Coalition for Clean Air, which  joined with the Sierra Club in successfully taking the EPA to federal court and  forcing it to issue its plan.  </P> <P> The EPA said its no-drive day proposal would not be implemented until the year  2000 and only then as a last resort.  </P> <P> Commuters would be forced to give up their cars one day a week and find other  means of transportation -- preferably ride-sharing or mass transit -- during  the months of November through February based on the license plate number of  their car.  </P> <P> The Southern California Assn. of Governments said it is "concerned" that the  EPA had failed to include in its plan tougher air pollution controls on  offshore oil rigs in federal waters on the outer continental shelf and a  requirement that federal government agencies in the Los Angeles Basin be  required to participate in ride-sharing plans just like other government  agencies and private employers.  </P> <P> Under the regional clean-air plan adopted a year ago by the South Coast Air  Quality Management District, ozone pollution -- the chief ingredient of  photochemical smog -- would be reduced enough to meet federal clean air  standards by the year 2007. The EPA would extend that to 2010.  </P> <P> While the AQMD plan calls for complying with the federal carbon monoxide  standard by Dec. 31, 1997, the EPA is calling for a 2004 deadline, or the year  2000 at the earliest.  </P></p>

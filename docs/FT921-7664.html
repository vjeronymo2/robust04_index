			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Letter: Ambitious, not unsuccessful Sir, Danny Chapchal's views (Management: The Growing Business, February 18) on why so many small businesses fail are hardly revolutionary and are particularly inappropriate for those companies fortunate to be still trading successfully. His comments about management style, employability and the 'we know best approach' are to be found in most business start-up handbooks. Although many people start businesses to be more successful than they are currently being, this should not imply that they are already unsuccessful, just that their ambitions are not being realised quickly enough. I gave up a successful career in the City during the boom years to set up my own company because I felt I could achieve more running my own operation. I was guilty of many of the traits he highlighted for failure, yet my particular organisation continues to be highly profitable even in the current climate. I would suggest that the secret for continued success is determination and the ability to try out new ideas and learn from both the unsuccessful and successful ones. Finally, as Lord Hanson has proved, to turn loss-making operations into profit by cost reduction and selling off subsidiaries is easier than profit generation and job creation from new ideas and products. Richard Watney, managing director, Compliance, 47a Old Woking Road, West Byfleet, Surrey</p>

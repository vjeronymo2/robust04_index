			<p>920826 FT  26 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei interrupts five-day winning streak THE Nikkei average declined for the first time in five trading days on profit-taking and short selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average, which had rallied more than 2,300 points during the past four days, lost 247.19 at 16,380.77, after registering a day's high of 16,823.67 and low of 16,322.26. Volume contracted to 400m shares from Monday's 570m, while declines led advances by 561 to 358, with 137 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks slipped 18.25 to 1,276.84, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.93 to 1,041.98. Traders said some investors were becoming wary of the sharp rise in the index, and had refrained from further buying. Domestic institutional investors were seen purchasing in small lots, while some short-sellers were covering positions. 'There may be more buying to be seen since only about 30 to 40 per cent of the short positions seem to have been covered,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Comments by government officials failed to encourage sentiment. Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, denied the possibility of the creation of a joint stock purchasing entity, as proposed by a business federation. Remarks by officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party and cabinet members also seemed to suggest that the authorities were at odds over the issue of government bonds to provide additional funding to boost the economy. Green Cross, a medium-sized pharmaceutical company, was the most active issue of the day, climbing by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,280. The stock has gained for five consecutive days on reports that its anti-Aids drug will enter clinical trials in the US. Banks retreated on profit-taking. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank shed Y80 to Y1,660 and Mitsubishi Bank Y180 to Y2,000. Credit ratings of both banks were lowered yesterday by Moody's Investor Services. Nippon Housing Loan added Y75 at Y476, although other property-related stocks declined, with Mitsui Fudosan losing Y20 to Y979 and Mitsubishi Estate Y22 to Y925. High-technology issues saw profit-taking, Hitachi weakening Y16 to Y803 and Fujitsu Y14 to Y583. Victor dropped Y73 to Y751 on reports that the company would lower its forecasts for the year. In Osaka, the OSE average relinquished 175.64 to 18,043.52 in volume of 20.6m shares. Roundup THE weaker dollar and Wall Street's fall unsettled the region's markets yesterday. HONG KONG declined in late trading as European institutions sold blue chips. The Hang Seng index dipped 99.44, or 1.8 per cent, to 5,291.49 in turnover of HKDollars 2.6bn. HSBC Holdings fell HKDollars 2.00 to HKDollars 47.75 on continued fears that it may announce a provision to cover its exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the troubled property group. Jardine Matheson lost HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 49 on news that forged share certificates had been seized in the US. SEOUL advanced for the third consecutive session, the composite index appreciating 10.77 to 494.50. The Securities Stabilisation Fund again intervened, buying Won5bn worth of equities. MANILA was upset by weakness in Philippine National Bank, which lost 12.50 pesos to 272.50 pesos as investors continued to react negatively to the government's appointment of a new board of directors. The composite index closed 15.26 down at 1,440.45 in combined turnover of 188.6m pesos. KUALA LUMPUR was disrupted by a computer failure during the last hour of trading and the composite index provisionally finished 4.29 lower at 561.27. Telekom, which was expected to release disappointing interim earnings after the close, was 60 cents weaker at MDollars 12.90 just before the computer malfunction. TAIWAN's weighted index receded 34.30 to 3,816.38, while turnover increased to TDollars 21.8bn from TDollars 19.2bn. BANGKOK concentrated on speculative stocks as the SET index declined 2.35 to 754.48 in low turnover of Bt7bn. NEW ZEALAND saw lacklustre trading and the NZSE-40 capital index finished 3.98 easier at 1,476.26 in turnover of some NZDollars 11.1m.</p>

			<p><P> October 13, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HAHN AND BLACK COMMUNITY  </P> <P> In response to Bill Boyarsky's column "Hahn Salute Foreshadows End of Era"  (Metro, Sept. 21):  </P> <P> The first portion of this article was very complimentary to Supervisor Kenneth  Hahn and deservedly so.  </P> <P> Boyarsky reported the comments of Drs. Joseph Griffin and E.V. Hill, in which  they stated that Supervisor Hahn, although a white man representing the 2nd  District which is predominantly black, "that the matter of color has never been  brought up." If the question is asked of any voter in the 2nd District,  regardless of color, about Supervisor Hahn's public service commitment, the  answer would be the same. "Supervisor Hahn is the greatest public servant we  know. He cares about people." He serves all fairly and equally and that's  understood!  </P> <P> Boyarsky did an outstanding job in reporting about Hahn and how the people feel  about him.  </P> <P> But the column went downhill when Boyarsky addressed the issue of confrontation  between blacks and other minority groups and the delivery of health care at  Martin Luther King Hospital. He wrote "black political power is waning in Los  Angeles. The tide of demography is running against blacks. . . . They are being  replaced by Latinos and Asians."  </P> <P> Boyarsky states, "There is potential for divisiveness, and perhaps the most  delicate issue is health care. The poor from all three groups suffer from a  shortage of public health care, and black leaders fear their community's poor  may be thrust into a losing competition for hospital and clinic care with  impoverished Latinos and Asians." These statements are inflammatory.  </P> <P> Demography is changing all over the county, the state and the nation. More  Third World people are moving in and the numbers are growing. The community  that has the most to fear is the community that has the most to lose, and that  is not the black community. The black community is committed to working with  Asians and Latinos. I believe there is no hostility among people who want to  work together -- and they will. They should just be left alone.  </P> <P> As to Martin Luther King Hospital, Hahn is correct when he blamed the shortage  of funds for the hospital's problems. I worked as his deputy for 12 years and I  have firsthand knowledge that monies that were needed for appropriate services  and equipment were never provided. However, the hospital administration,  doctors and nurses working with the bare minimum always did the best job under  adverse circumstances.  </P> <P> King Hospital is not the only hospital in the county system that's been on  conditional accreditation. For example, County-USC Medical Center is currently  on the status of conditional accreditation; the High Desert Hospital, formerly  Mira Loma, lost its accreditation. Simply put, mostly poor people are required  to go to county hospitals, but the "downtown Hall of Administration" doesn't  always provide sufficient funding for staffing and equipment.  </P> <P> Doctors and nurses have to work hard enough. They should not be blamed for the  shortsightedness of bureaucrats.  </P> <P> Writing Hahn off for reelection is a mistake. That decision still remains with  Hahn and the people of the 2nd District. I know Rep. Julian Dixon (D-Los  Angeles) is a good person; he is my congressman. However, the reporter went a  little too far in selecting by inference Hahn's successor. That right shall  always remain with the people.  </P> <P> NATE HOLDEN  </P> <P> Councilman, 10th District  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

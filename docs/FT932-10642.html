			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / International Company News: Ford Australia heads back to the black FORD Motor Company of Australia has reduced substantially its losses for 1992 after returning to the black in the second half of the year. The company yesterday declared a ADollars 38.3m (USDollars 27.2m) net loss for last year, against a ADollars 113.8m loss in 1991 - the third consecutive loss for Ford, one of four local carmakers. Mr John Ogden, president, said yesterday sales rose 8 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn last year and that the company had traded at a profit for the first quarter of 1993 after leaving the red in the half to December 1992. Mr Ogden said this was achieved despite market weakness in Australia as well as in the US, Ford Australia's main export market. He said Ford had lifted its total Australian market share from 18.9 per cent to 19.7 per cent in the first quarter of 1993 and expected industry sales to increase by about 2 per cent this year. Pacific BBA, the Australian plastics and car parts maker formerly controlled by BBA Group of the UK, plans to acquire Webforge (Singapore) from Prudential Asia for about Dollars 44m. Webforge is Australia's dominant maker of steel gratings with annual sales of about Dollars A40m. The company also has operations in Singapore, New Zealand and China. Pacific BBA said the acquisition would provide the nucleus of a new building and construction division which would complement the company's automotive components and industrial plastics operations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 20 Mar (TANJUG) -- Milan Martic,  president of the republic of Serb Krajina [RSK], told Radio  Kragujevac today that the Serbs in the RSK will not renounce  their right to self-determination and that "this is the minimum  below which we will not go in any talks dealing with the fate of  the Serb nation, including the Zagreb talks scheduled for  Tuesday."    Taking part in the Hallmark of the Times program on Radio  Kragujevac, Martic said that claims that Serbia has given up on  Krajina are pure speculation.    He stressed that the talks in the Russian Embassy in Zagreb  are useful for many reasons: They are to be held on neutral  territory, equality in talks has been ensured and, most  important, the door has been opened for the RSK to join  international negotiations on the former Yugoslavia.    Asked about his views on the role of the Russian side, which  is sponsoring the talks, Martic said Russian diplomacy has an  important role in stabilizing the situation in the Balkans and  in establishing peace.    He said the Washington agreement between the Muslims and  Croats was the result of the U.S. initiative which should secure  long-term U.S. interests in the Balkans.    The RSK president believes that the [Croat-Muslim] alliance  will not last long. "The alliance will make the RSK's position  difficult for a while, but no one can return the RSK to Croatia  by force," Martic stressed.    Our fate depends most on the determination and readiness for  further efforts and pressures which will follow both in the  sphere of diplomacy and defense.</p>

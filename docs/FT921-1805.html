			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (2): A reputation for quality - Tourism AFTER a season of cancelled bookings and deep price cuts, forecasts of a record year for Cyprus tourism are being greeted with cautious relief. The Gulf crisis interrupted a decade of steady expansion in the island's tourist industry. Foreign visitors were flown home by tour operators worried about rising insurance costs, while hotel occupancy rates plummeted to 25 per cent in the first few months of 1991. Staff were laid off and some hotels closed. 'There was a misunderstanding about our geographic position. Attention tended to focus on how close, rather than how far, we were from the hostilities,' says Mr Andreas Nicholaou, chairman of the Cyprus Tourist Organisation (CTO). Although bookings recovered over the summer, reaching normal levels by September, arrivals for the year totalled 1.32m, a 15 per cent decline from the record number of 1.56m in 1990. Foreign exchange earnings fell from CPounds 573m to CPounds 470m as hoteliers cut prices in an effort to cover losses earlier in the season. This year, however, arrivals are projected to reach 1.65m, although revenues will rise more slowly than in the past. Prices remain close to 1991 levels, reflecting apprehension that Cyprus would not immediately be able to recover its share of the European market. In fact, price stability brought such a rush of bookings in medium-priced hotels that the CTO had to intervene to prevent overbooking. Operators in Britain, the main market, are being reassured that anyone left without a room will be given one in a four- or five-star hotel. This year, too, hoteliers will be struggling to cope with a staff shortage, the result of full employment in the south of the island. Foreign contract workers, many from eastern European countries, are being hired as cooks, chambermaids and restaurant staff so that as many Cypriots as possible are available for jobs involving direct contact with visitors. Last month, Cyprus Airways, the state carrier, launched a charter subsidiary, Eurocypria, to which it leased two new Airbus A320s. According to Mr Tassos Angelis, the airline's spokesman, Eurocypria has already sold 140,000 seats, its entire capacity for the season. In southern Cyprus, tourism grew much faster during the 1980s than in the rest of Europe, with the development of resorts along the southern and western coast to replace those abandoned in 1974 after the Turkish invasion of the north. The growth rate in Europe from 1980-90 averaged 3.5 per cent, while foreign exchange earnings rose by an average 8.3 per cent. For Cyprus, the equivalent figures were 16 and 23 per cent. Apart from being a sun-and-sea destination, with a longer season than Greece or much of the Turkish Aegean coast, Cyprus is held to offer better standards of service than in other Mediterranean countries. Even Ayia Napa, the Cyprus equivalent Benidorm, attracts a proportion of 'repeat' visitors. Other resorts, especially Paphos, appeal to older tourists who are more likely to return within two or three years. Cyprus managed at the same time to acquire a reputation for quality which the CTO is anxious to preserve. 'The 1990s will be the decade of quality destinations. They are the ones that will survive in an increasingly competitive world,' says Mr Nicholaou. The CTO aims at increasing Cyprus's share of the growing international market in incentive and conference tourism, adding more marinas to attract yacht owners south from Greece and Turkey, and developing the special interest market. Already, Scandinavian and central European soccer teams hold training sessions in Cyprus. Elderly visitors from Britain or Finland, escaping from northern European winters for longer stays, can take courses in botany or Greek cooking. Until now, Cyprus has not been a regular port of call for Mediterranean cruise ships. But as local travel agencies have discovered, one profitable way of keeping visitors entertained is to offer them short cruises to Egypt and Israel, both within easy reach of the island. Although an 18-month moratorium on hotel construction has ended, the intention is to avoid a rash of new building. With 65,000 beds available, mostly in three-star hotels, capacity is thought be adequate. In future, priority will be given to four- or five-star hotels with a wide range of leisure and sports facilities. Yet if Cyprus is to focus successfully on up-market tourism, the market must be diversified to include more French, German, Austrian and Swiss visitors. At present, British tourists account for 49 per cent of arrivals, with Scandinavians the next-largest category at 16 per cent. The next step being planned by the CTO is to persuade Americans and Japanese to include Cyprus on their European itineraries.</p>

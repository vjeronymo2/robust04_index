			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Academician Georgiy Arbatov, under the "Opinion" </F> rubric: "Are We Doomed to Fascism? The Time Has Come To Climb  Down From the Tanks and To Work Normally"]    [Text] When things are going badly in the country,  and the ruling party leads the economy and social relations into  a dead end, the people suffer national humiliation, and a  considerable part of the voters rush into the arms of extreme  rightists or leftists. Such is the long-standing law of  political life and, while this has happened here for the first  time, this is still not a reason for hysterics. As went the  politics (and there were warnings about this more than once), so  went the results of the elections. In the course of two years,  after the victory over the putsch, which, it would seem, opened  unprecedented prospects for social progress, the country went  downhill faster and faster, and at the same time the process  became more and more unmanageable.    I got the firm impression that over the last year the higher  leadership and its immediate circle, and the executive and  legislative authorities of the economy, almost stopped working  completely on other substantive matters and switched over to  political confrontations. They followed one after the other,  right up to the culmination--the dissolution of parliament,  street fights, the tank firing on the White House, and the  December elections. Elections that, according to the party  rolls, brought success to V. Zhirinovskiy--an extreme  nationalist--which stunned the people, but if we speak in the  vernacular--it brought success to the fascists. (It would be  interesting to know who from his close circle contrived to  convince the president that, despite the worsening economic  decline, crime, corruption, and general desolation, he and his  supporters would absolutely win in the parliamentary elections,  and whether these liars and sycophants are still in his retinue?)    For me, the events of December 1993 proved to be, perhaps,  especially impressive--over the period of my life I have seen  the successful movement of fascism to power for a second time  already. (It happened that I lived with my parents in Germany,  who were there on official business from 1930 to 1935; I saw a  lot, and, naturally I heard a lot, and I understood quite a lot,  for my 13 years, in this highly politicized situation. I  understood, in particular, how horrible crimes are committed  under the cloak of lofty words, and that even highly placed  politicians commit fatal mistakes and stupidities out of hand. I  understood how even an ordinary citizen who is good-natured in  his personal life is transformed into a fanatic, with eyes that  are glazed over with zeal, who is ready for any crimes in the  service of the fuhrer, and how this then leads step by step to  bloody slaughter. It also did not bypass my generation,  including me personally. On the eve of fascism in Germany, an  economic crisis was raging, as it is here now also; the majority  was destitute, a handful of rich men was bursting with wealth,  the authority of the leadership was rapidly falling, the people  were suffering from poverty and from national humiliation, the  politicians were bogged down in a struggle for power and in a  game of brute instincts, inflaming the nationalism of the  lumpenized layer of the population.)    I shudder inside thinking that I will have occasion to see  all of this and, what is more, to live through it a second time.  I am somehow not reassured by talk that, it is said, after a  final vote count Zhirinovsky does not have a relative majority  in the Duma and in general has nobody in the Federation Council.  This is self-deception, and an attempt to conceal the main  point. And it consists in the fact that numerous mistakes and a  thoughtless and untalented policy has led to the fact that  fascism has appeared among us, which today already has become an  appreciable political force that has acquired not only millions  of supporters among the voters, but also support (or at least  the sympathy) in important state structures, foreign ties, and  important sources of financing inside the country and, perhaps,  abroad as well.    This is an event that is radically changing the political  landscape and the political climate in the country. It also has  an appreciable influence on our international position and on  the attitude toward us in the world. We are again becoming a  source of international danger for others, or, at a minimum, a  pretext for someone to retain nuclear weapons and for someone,  nevertheless, to squeeze into NATO. And many have refused, or  will refuse at least some of the already planned reductions in  military expenditures. In short, we have gotten ourselves into a  mess along all lines. Only a blind man could fail to see all of  this. And it will hardly be possible to shake up this change  even after the replacement of the leadership of Ostankino.    I am somehow also not reassured by positive statements that  Zhirinovskiy will get on with Yeltsin beautifully--if this  occurs, this means that I (like a majority of the others) erred  severely either in Vladimir Volfovich or in Boris Nikolayevich.    The situation is being complicated by the fact that the  Communist Party, and the Agrarian Union (the other pole of the  political spectrum that is getting stronger), which has joined  it, have not yet made a determination on a fundamental  question--whether they will be leftist or rightist parties. I  personally think that besides a move toward a social-democratic  platform, that they have no independent political future, but  they, after all, might judge entirely differently.    A lot has already been written on the subject of the  elections and Zhirinovskiy, and I would not like to repeat  myself, including the fact that, as I surmised, in spite of his  personal desires, Gaydar, his team, his benefactors, and his  economic policy have become the godfather of our homegrown  fascism.    Therefore, I will turn to the answer to the question raised  in the headline. I am profoundly convinced that we are not  doomed to fascism. There is a solution. It lies in the unity of  all democratic forces and in a broad democratic coalition.  (Somehow it turned out in previous years that our "primary"  democrats in a purely Bolshevist way beat on potential allies  most zealously of all, almost not touching their most bitter  enemies.) But only a sincere, really honest, and a mandatory  public admission of the mistakes made in the two years can  become the condition for such a unity and coalition (otherwise  nobody will believe anybody). And, moreover, unity on a new  radically revised platform--economic and political (unity and  coalition are otherwise inconceivable)--none of the sensible  economists will agree to participate in a continuation of the  ruinous monetarist experiments of Gaydar, Boris Fedorov, and  Jeffrey Sachs).    With respect to economics, not being a professional, I will  limit myself to only several passing remarks. Can it really be  that difficult, if this is really desired, to gain an  understanding of these price spirals and impetuous grabbing, and  to set up a barrier against depredation, irresponsibility, and  sometimes even simply stupidity. And to conduct intelligent  measures (but again not requisition measures, but with the help  of taxes, privileges, the removal of excessive rights of  officials, and privatization somewhere, and so on) that are able  to bring life to a civilized form, when we would be able to do  everything in full view of the people, not allow anyone to  produce [as published] and at least more or less specifically,  but without deceit and demagogy, establish dates when the  situation will begin to improve. It is necessary to see clearly  that the solution to the crisis does not lie in a monetarist  focus, but in a growth in production--but this is precisely  where almost nothing in fact was done. A revision of the tax  system is necessary so that it does not impede production, but  encourages it, and a system for extending credits and a broader  and more sensible involvement of foreign investments. We should  not encourage laziness in the domestic producer who hopes as  before to live without being in a hurry and exerting himself,  owing to the fact that, as before, he will fleece his consumer.  It is necessary to protect oneself from foreign competition on a  scale that is reasonable and advantageous to the country,  without losing sight of the fact that the ultimate objective  will be the widest possible free trade. Otherwise, we will die  as suppliers of raw materials.    A well-thought-out industrial policy is needed (a kind of  elaboration of this has been started), as well as a system of  measures that will bring a real revolution in agriculture.  Today, in this transition period to a market, the government,  the state, and local authorities must in this sense rely not on  the "invisible hand" of Adam Smith, which, it is said, will do  everything itself under price liberalization, but to work by the  sweat of the brow, as is being done in South Korea, Japan,  Mexico, Singapore, and other countries where there is a serious  resolve to forge ahead.    I will not write anymore about economics--I am confident  that  the subject has been adequately developed by G. Yavlinskiy, N.  Petrakov, O. Bogomolov, and also the department of economics of  the Russian Academy of Sciences, to which in these two years,  unfortunately, no one found the time to listen. I heard with  hope that recently the prime minister and his deputies are  beginning to incline to the side of a true economic policy. But  I will talk about social programs in more detail. In many of  them during the Bolshevist years that we are damning (frequently  for a reason), we nevertheless set an example for the developed  world. But now we are shamefully going back--in education, in  health services, and in people's access to culture. In contrast  to many countries of the West, property polarization is taking  place, and together with it--a dangerous social tension (also a  feeding ground for fascism). Previously, the privileges of the  leadership were concealed (with which, judging by his recent  television interview, the president reconciled himself), and  now--even its pay. You learn with amazement that the director of  an average-sized plant can set a salary for himself of a couple  and even dozens of millions of rubles a month. Any transparency  has been deliberately covered here.    As for the "lower levels," it would seem that not even an  objective is being established to create a decent subsistence  minimum for current conditions, guaranteed humane living  conditions for old age and disability, and even for burials that  are worthy of a person, and not for cattle dying on the roadside.    Transportation, communications, and other services have  become luxury items that are accessible only to the wealthiest,  without any justification. Rents in the city are increasing  astronomically, and many cities, nonetheless, are falling into  decay.    It is nonetheless impossible to compel the government to  analyze this ratcheting of prices and unrestrained inflation in  the whole system and to set a barrier against depredation,  irresponsibility, and sometimes also simple stupidity, but to  implement intelligent measures (again not requisition measures,  but with the help of taxes, privileges, withdrawal of excessive  rights of officials, somewhere privatization, and so on) that  are capable of arranging life in a civilized form, when we would  be able to do everything in full view of the people, not permit  anyone to be arbitrary, and more or less specifically, but  without deceit and demagogy, to establish dates when the  situation will begin to improve.    I want to say something about policy. First about domestic  policy.    A little more than two years were actually lost, despite the  unique conditions that developed after the defeat of the putsch  (in the sense of the development of democracy). If anyone thinks  that the Constitution, which was adopted without the  consideration of a fourth of the voters, is democratic and  legitimate--this is a dubious proposition. In order to make it  such, we will probably have to do a lot of sweating yet. But  what is to be said about the much-promised, but already  forgotten, legal reform that would guarantee life for every one  of us in a genuine rule-of-law state? Which implies both  democratism of the legal process and an inexorable struggle with  crime and corruption--without the latter we will have neither a  normal economy nor simply a normal life.    Putting political life in good order, of course, will  require  a lot of other things. I will restrict myself simply to naming  them in some degree. Normal political parties must finally  appear, with clear political platforms. A much improved election  law, which was not concocted in a slapdash way, is needed. I am  not talking now about such great tasks for us as a rational  system of relations of the center, regions, and local  self-government. As well as a normally working parliament and  government that are smaller in number, but better in ability.  The time has come to climb down from the tanks and engage in  professional and normal work honestly and diligently every day.    Now about foreign policy. Whether we like it or not, Russia  will remain a great power. And it cannot get away from its share  of responsibility (of course, together with other powers) for  international affairs, including for the very important and very  responsible task of restructuring the entire system of  international relations after the end of the Cold War, for the  creation of regional security systems, especially in regions  contiguous to us--in Europe, in southern and eastern Asia, in  the northern part of the Pacific Ocean, and for the  demilitarization of international relations. We played a  decisive role in stopping the Cold War, we organized cooperation  with the major countries of the world, and we can resolve these  problems. Not assenting to the West in everything, of course,  displaying will and persistence, and when necessary--initiative  as well. It is necessary, it is true, to react quickly and with  adequate resolve to the irresponsible twaddle of some of the  Russian politicians who are appearing in the arena--given all of  its foolishness, this political idle talk could do considerable  damage to Russia's national interests.    We still do not have a well-balanced concept nor a  consistent  policy in countries of the so-called near abroad--but, after  all, this is our main priority today. Russia, perhaps, is the  only one of the former republics of the USSR that can both  "exist by itself" and even prosper, ensuring its own security,  normal economic activity, and even a certain increase in the  standard of living of the people (if, of course, the plundering  of national property is stopped). However, everything is  possible in a friendly environment! In a hostile one, it will be  even more difficult for great Russia to live than in the Cold  War years.    The former Soviet Union was born out of an empire, and for a  long time it was a totalitarian empire itself, which made it  intolerable even for Russia, which declared its own sovereignty  in 1990. The other republics felt the yoke of imperial  oppression even more. We, like they, have a vital need of normal  relations. One of the conditions is for us, Russians, to  convince our neighbors that Russia has no kinds of imperial  claims with respect to them, and to convince them not with words  (who believes words today!), but with deeds. Then, the natural  tendencies toward integration will begin to work in full force,  as they began to work after the Second World War in Western  Europe. And out of something that is illusory and neutral, the  CIS will become a reality, ensuring the mutual interests of  economic development, security, and cultural and human  relations, with the full stability of independent states. And it  is entirely impermissible to make up for obsequiousness to the  West with pressure, and even rudeness, with respect to our  neighbors.    To sacrifice the prospect of improving relations and a  genuine alliance with them for the sake of being witty about  Crimea, and in order to be reputed to be a jingo patriot, is  unworthy of every true patriot of Russia.    And, finally--every nation (and its leader as well) should  imagine how it wants to see its future and its objectives. The  replacement of the "developed structure of socialism" by the  "developed structure of capitalism," for heaven's sake, does not  accomplish this task. Every Russian--both the ordinary citizen  and the leader--wants to know, and has a right to know, where we  are heading today. The democratic coalition should explain this  to him truthfully, simply, and clearly. Especially because there  is a good future before our country, if its people work honestly  and manage the affairs of state skillfully. Few other states  have such natural and intellectual resources, and such cultural,  industrial, and agricultural potential.    The matter today really lies in proper policy and  leadership,  and first and foremost in them. This is the most reliable  antidote against fascism. Somehow, no one has yet gone from a  normal, good life to fascism.</p>

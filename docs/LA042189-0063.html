			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The United Nations will send another convoy of food to starving masses in  southern Sudan, this time along a different route than the treacherous path  traveled by an earlier convoy that was attacked by rebels, a spokesman said.  Seven people died in the attack in rebel-held territory. The new 47-truck  convoy is to carry 1,100 tons of maize from Uganda's capital, Kampala, on a  two-day journey to the Sudanese city of Nimule just across the border.  Operation Lifeline Sudan seeks to avert 100,000 famine deaths by stocking more  than 110,000 tons of food in southern Sudan before heavy rains begin in  mid-May. But the operation, in addition to the attack, has been plagued with  delays caused by political difficulties, bad weather and equipment shortages.  </P></p>

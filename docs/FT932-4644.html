			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Government Bonds: Gonzalez victory prompts long-dated rally in Spain THE surprise election victory of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's socialist prime minister, sparked a half-point rally in long-dated Spanish government bonds yesterday. Dealers said the main feature of the market was the flattening of the yield curve as long-dated bonds outperformed short-dated issues. Many investors, both foreign and domestic, were keen to do lengthening trades - to switch out of short-dated issues into long-dated bonds - on the assumption that the socialist government would cut interest rates gradually. 'The curve had been very steep as the market had discounted a PP (conservative People's Party) victory which would have meant faster rate cuts,' said Mr Steve Major, bond analyst at Credit Lyonnais. Mr Jouni Kokko, economist at SG Warburg Securities, said: 'The decisive victory means a vote of confidence in the ERM and a gradual easing in money market rates - so we won't see a float of the peseta or quick interest rate cuts.' However, he added that the next interest rate easing could take place as soon as next week at the June 15 repo. The Meffsa futures contract rose from 88.55 to end at 89.00, having been as high as 89.15 at one stage. TECHNICAL pressures sent German government bonds lower at first, although they rallied later on hopes of an interest rate cut to close marginally higher. Bund futures fell in the morning as traders sold heavily to square their books ahead of yesterday's expiry of the June contract. There was pressure from dealers hedging against a new DM3bn Treuhand bond issue. The June 2003 issue was given a 6 7/8 per cent coupon. Dealers said there was little demand for 10-year German paper at present as investors became increasingly cautious over the prospect of over-supply. Economic analysts were searching for signals of a further cut in the repo rate following comments by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the vice-president of the Bundesbank, on Friday. The German central bank has maintained its repo rate at 7.6 per cent for the past month and opinions are divided on whether it might be prepared to shave it by a few basis points tomorrow. The September bund futures contract was 25 basis points lower at one stage but closed six basis points higher on the day at 94.09. FRENCH government bonds benefited more significantly from Mr Tietmeyer's comments, and received a further lift from a rate cut in Denmark. Economists said the Bundesbank vice-president had argued for lower rates in France than in Germany on Friday. This combined with a general fillip from Denmark where the central bank cut its discount and key deposit rates to 7.75 per cent from 8.25 per cent effective today. On the Matif, the June futures contract was bid up by 0.60 to end at 117.30 on turnover of 110,000 contracts during official trading. IN the UK, overseas buying, specifically from Germany, sent the September gilt futures contract up to 103.22 from 103.14. Further progress was held back as domestic investors concentrated on Friday's announcement of new gilts issuance. The Bank of England offered Pounds 600m in government bonds split evenly between 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock due 1998, 9 3/4 per cent stock dated 2002 and 9 per cent stock dated 2012. Dealers said around Pounds 50m of the 2002 issue and Pounds 50m of the 2012 issue was taken up. ITALIAN government bonds closed slightly higher helped by the strength of the lira and hopes of lower interest rates. Dealers said the local elections at the weekend, which showed strong gains for the protest and left-wing parties at the expense of the mainstream parties, had little impact on the bond market. The September Liffe futures contract ended up 0.03 at 99.67 on relatively low volume. US Treasury prices rebounded from last Friday's heavy losses yesterday, posting solid gains at the long end of the market amid dealer short-covering and municipal bond defeasance. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 103 1/16 , yielding 6.878 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  1/16 at 99, to yield 4.274 per cent. After last week's late declines, which were prompted by a bigger-than-expected increase in May payrolls, prices got off to a firm, if uninspired, start. Analysts had expected the heavy losses to bring some bargain hunters into the market, and they did. JAPANESE government bonds ended mixed yesterday, with the benchmark cash bond closing firmer while futures ended weaker on the day. The bond market opened on a weak note, continuing Friday's decline and following the fall in the US Treasury bond market in response to stronger-than-expected US jobs data. The yield on the benchmark No 145 JGB opened at 4.58 per cent, and moved to 4.54 per cent before ending the day at 4.555 per cent. The September futures contract opened at 107.28 and fell to a low of 106.99 before recovering to end at 107.15.</p>

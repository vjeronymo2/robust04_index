Speaking at a news conference, he also said that the rift in  the party will soon be resolved with the vote of no confidence  in Dragoljub Micunovic, president of the Democratic Party.  Srdjan Savic reports:    [Savic] The meeting of the Main Committee of the Democratic  Party was interrupted early this morning because there was no  quorum during the casting of the vote of confidence in the party  president, Dragoljub Micunovic, Djindjic said. The session of  the Main Committee will be resumed on Saturday [15 January] at  which members will not make speeches, but only hold a vote of  confidence in the party's president. The convening of the  conference of the Democratic Party will also be on the agenda.  There is no danger of yet another Democratic Party being  formed, Djindjic said, stressing that the dispute with Micunovic  is not personal and that they only have conceptual differences.    The president of the Executive Committee of the Democrats  holds the view that the political life in Serbia represents the  continuation of a chaos, that wages and pensions are not being  paid because of the shortage of cash, and that the German mark  is becoming the main unit of account. According to him, all  this is being induced by the Government of the Republic of  Serbia.    Djindjic stressed that the Democratic Party will not enter  the government formed by the Socialists. He said that  Sainovic's government will remain in office until the next  elections, which should be expected soon. A compromise is  nevertheless possible, and the next move should be made by  Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and the Socialist Party of  Serbia, Zoran Djindjic concluded.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 1 KYODO -- Canada expects its tight  fiscal 1994 budget to keep Japanese financial institutions prime  investors in Canadian debt instruments, Doug Peters, secretary  of state for international financial institutions, said Tuesday  [1 March].    In an interview with KYODO NEWS SERVICE, Peters said that  while Canada's budget process "is not directed specifically to  Japanese or any other foreign investors," the fact that the  country has tackled its federal deficit will keep investors  confident in Canada.    A former chief economist with one of his country's largest  banks, Peters perhaps knows international financial markets  better than many cabinet ministers.    He said the Japanese bank, brokerage and insurance company  executives he met in Tokyo have all been encouraged by Canada's  commitment to fiscal stability.    "We have been very pleased with the reception (to the  budget)  here," Peters said.    And it is no coincidence that Canada's junior finance  minister is in Japan only days after Finance Minister Paul  Martin brought down the budget February 22.    Japanese institutional investors hold more than 40 billion  dollars in Canadian Government and private debt instruments,  including federal and provincial bonds.    A loss of confidence in Canada, where the government of  Prime  Minister Jean Chretien took office only last autumn, could mean  a massive sale of Canadian debt on international and domestic  markets and a major headache for the new government.    Peters, who met with Japanese Government officials as well  as  financial executives, said he now has little fear of any heavy  selling by Japanese investors.    "The Japanese are long term investors in Canada and I fully  expect them to remain so," he said.    On other investment fronts, Peters said he also gained a  "sense" that Japanese direct investment in Canadian business  could increase.    Trade trouble with the United States "is very much on  people's minds (in Japan)," and Canada could see increased  direct investment because of worries about the U.S., Peters  suggested.    "The other side of the question, however, is that saber  rattling by the United States could make the Japanese very aware  of importing from American companies. Canadians must make very  sure that does not hurt their markets in Japan."    He also suggested that Canadians are "very interested" in  U.S. attempts to open Japanese markets, particularly in  financial services where he believes Canadian financial  institutions have expertise.    "We are concerned about transparency in some rules that may  shut us out of areas such as financial derivatives and other new  financing methods where Canadians have a deservedly high  reputation," he said.    Peters will visit investment institutions in Hong Kong on  Wednesday before returning to Canada on Thursday.</p>

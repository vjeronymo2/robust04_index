			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool WOOL Australian wool prices continued to slide this week. The wool on offer did not cover a full range and declines were not large, but the prospect of an easier tendency at the close of the full selling season next week discourages business all down the line. The Australian Wool Corporation has lowered it's forecast for prices next season, now tentatively suggesting an average for the market indicator of 600 cents a kg., compared with 620 cents forecast when the market looked better and supplies were expected to be lower. The market indicator on June 17 was 561 cents a kg., compared with 577 a week before.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / International Company News: Big reduction in Aerospatiale losses Aerospatiale, the French aircraft and missiles group, yesterday announced a sharp reduction in losses in 1993, from FFr2.38bn to FFr1.42bn (Dollars 246m), but warned of continued severe competition in international markets. According to the group, the improvement in results was the result of efficiency and economy measures, from lower spending on operating costs to stricter controls on investments. Net debts were reduced from FFr16.5bn at the end of 1992 to FFr13.3bn. The state-owned aircraft company said that 1993 was 'profoundly affected by the difficult situation facing airlines and overcapacity in the sector'. It said its markets were also hit by severe competition for military orders resulting from budgetary constraints. The various factors helped explain a fall in turnover from FFr52.3bn in 1992 to FFr50.8bn and a decline in orders from FFr39.8bn to FFr28.9bn. Aerospatiale said the current year 'would probably not see any significant improvement in the economic environment' and competition would remain intense.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Novosibirsk Bank Failures"] </F>   [Text] Novosibirsk -- Two major Novosibirsk banks have  announced that they are ending operations and proposing that  clients close their accounts.    The first bank to fail -- the "Siberian Development Bank" --  has been on its last legs for more than a year. This led to a  change of management and the attraction of considerable amounts  of funds to rescue the situation. It did not help. Experts  believe that the collapse was inevitable. The Novosibirsk  management of "Mosbiznesbank" lent a hand to their bankrupt  colleagues. But, naturally, not in the form of money. They  offered staff from the failed bank jobs at their new branch.    The second victim of competition and market conditions has  been the "Novosibirsk Innovation Commercial Bank."</p>

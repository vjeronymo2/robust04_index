			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / BASF buys Boots prescription drug arm for Dollars 1.4bn: Biggest of recent German healthcare deals BASF, the German chemicals manufacturer, took its biggest step yet into the pharmaceuticals industry yesterday by agreeing to pay 'about Pounds 850m' (Dollars 1.4bn) for the prescription drugs arm of Boots, the UK retailer. The proposed deal, still subject to detailed contract discussions, would be BASF's third in two months. The pace of dealmaking indicates a determined - if belated - effort to improve the performance of Knoll, BASF's drugs division. Knoll has annual sales of only DM2bn and fell into loss last year, compared with Bayer's drugs business, which contributes about two thirds of group profits from annual sales of DM8bn (Dollars 5.3bn). BASF said yesterday the rationale for the Boots acquisition was 'both therapeutic and geographic'. Boots is strong in the US, UK and Commonmwealth countries while BASF has most of its business in continental Europe. BASF also wants Boots' expertise in nervous-system drugs. Boots has licences to develop two such drugs, with projected launch dates at the end of the decade. Until then, BASF will have to make do with an old and small product portfolio. In the first half of 1994, Boots achieved prescription drugs sales of Pounds 226m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 49.8m. Spending on research and development was Pounds 33m. Most of Boots's prescription drug sales and profits come from Synthroid, a thyroid drug available only in the US. The drug had first-half sales of Dollars 117m - outside the world's top 100 best sellers. Synthroid, like all other significant Boots products, has no patent protection. Older drugs have been a central theme of BASF's deals recently. Last month it bought rights to 80 out-of-patent generic drugs from Hexal Pharma and signed a deal with Ivax, the second-biggest generics company in the US, to distribute drugs in Europe. In global terms, the Boots deal is small. BASF's Pharma division has annual sales of DM2bn. With the Boots operation, BASF would move from about 40th biggest in the world in terms of drugs sales to about 30th. The acquisition would nevertheless be the biggest of the recent forays into healthcare by German chemicals companies. In March, Bayer spent Dollars 130m on a 28.3 per cent stake in Schein, a privately owned US group. That followed last year's Dollars 546m purchase by Hoechst of a 51 per cent stake in Copley Pharmaceuticals, another US company. For Boots, the proposed deal ends months of speculation over Boots's intentions. The company put its prescription drugs business up for sale when adverse side-effects of its most promising drug, the heart treatment Manoplax, forced it in July 1993 to abandon its development. Yesterday's decision commits the UK company to developing as a retailer, after it has spent most of its 140-year history trying to combine healthcare with shopkeeping. BASF beat several rivals to the deal, including a management buy-out team. Other companies that had been in talks with Boots included Zeneca and Medeva of the UK, but no agreement was reached on price. Lex, Page 18 Boots drugs sale, Page 28</p>

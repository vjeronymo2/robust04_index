			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / Letter: Simpler way to encourage use of Ecu Sir, Lord Cobbold suggests some interesting ideas for easing the introduction of a single European currency ('How to make the Ecu user-friendly', May 12). A simpler way of encouraging use of the Ecu might be to improve the general ability of companies, particularly smaller ones, to manage their foreign exchange exposure and, in so doing, show them how the Ecu can be useful now. While many large firms already use the Ecu to hedge against overseas exposures, smaller ones are often unaware of even basic Treasury management techniques and of the Ecu-based services their local bank offers. A study we undertook for the European Commission last year revealed that most EC banks offer a comprehensive range of Ecu-based services. It should be easy to set up an Ecu bank account for payments made to and received from several EC countries, thus reducing exchange costs. Equally, assuming overseas purchasers agree, there are few problems to invoicing in Ecus, which lessens the risks of volatile exchange rates. The main obstacle is ignorance. Both the Commission, as promoter of the Ecu, and our own resurgent Department of Trade and Industry, as promoters of overseas trade, might like to consider how they could assist small firms to manage foreign currency exposure better.

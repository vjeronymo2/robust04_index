The  event was attended by Pedro Ross, secretary general of the Cuban  Workers Federation, and Ricardo Alarcon, president of the  National Assembly of the People's Government.    Union leaders, deputies, and delegates to the People's  Government in the province held an intense debate on the  economic problems being confronted and the possible solutions.  It was stressed that the most important thing is to seek  efficiency at each work place and labor post. The meeting, held  prior to the beginning of the process in the work centers, was  presided over by Politburo members Ricardo Alarcon and Pedro  Ross.    It was stated that Matanzas Province has a budget deficit of  120 million pesos and that 11 local enterprises received  subsidies totaling 213 million pesos during 1993. The money in  circulation totals 1.12 billion pesos, which is equivalent to  the salary of 20 months. Confronting these problems demands  intelligence, creativity, and, above all, work.    [Begin Alarcon recording] In the meetings in which we have  participated so far, we have seen clearly how the workers are  capable of identifying in each place how costs can be reduced,  and how to increase production and economic efficiency. This is  how the entire nation, everyone, everywhere, pulling together,  confronts and ought to truly confront the situation we are  currently facing.    I believe that this is how we all truly participate in the  parliamentary process. [end recording]</p>

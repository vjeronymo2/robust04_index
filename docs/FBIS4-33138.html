			<p>BFN     [Text] San Salvador, 31 May (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central  American Integration System (SICA) will legally replace the  Organization of Central America States (ODECA) after the  "Succession Act" is signed by the nations in the area,  represented by their ambassadors, in San Salvador today.  According to official reports, the Central American ambassadors  have taken the last legal step to allow the transfer of ODECA  assets, rights, and holdings to SICA.    ODECA was created on 12 December 1962, according to a  presidential agreement called the "San Salvador Charter." SICA  was established, according to the 13 December 1991 "Tegucigalpa  Protocol," to coordinate regional integration actions and  institutions determined by heads of state in the region.    A SICA communique explains that according to a resolution  issued at the 13th Central American summit, held in Panama on 11  December 1992, the institution had to begin operations, based in  San Salvador, on 1 February 1993, and later settle its legal  position, which it is doing today. "SICA asserts itself as a  far-reaching, modern, humanist organization which has already  yielded results by guaranteeing the coordination of the  integration process in the fields of the economic, social,  cultural, and political development of the isthmus," the  communique states.</p>

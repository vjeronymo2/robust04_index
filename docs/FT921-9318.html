			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Company News: Plant sale boosts net at Goodyear FOURTH-QUARTER net earnings at Goodyear, the last surviving US tyre-maker, were boosted by a Dollars 43.2m extraordinary after-tax gain from the sale of an Alabama tyre cord plant. The company also forecast the sale of more non-tyre assets during 1992. The Ohio-based Goodyear yesterday reported net profits of Dollars 105.1m, or Dollars 1.65 per share, for the fourth quarter of 1991, up sharply from the Dollars 11.6m, or 20 cents of the last quarter of 1990. Fourth-quarter sales of Dollars 2.8bn were down slightly on the corresponding period in 1990. Goodyear's fourth-quarter earnings, which were forecast by the company last month, would have been 97 cents a share without the gain from the Alabama asset disposal. Lower interest expenses also helped the company's net result. For the whole of 1991, Goodyear managed net earnings of Dollars 96.6m, or Dollars 1.61, against a loss of Dollars 38.3m, or 66 cents, in 1990. The company last month forecast a Dollars 96m 1991 net profit. Revenues for 1991 were 3.2 per cent lower at Dollars 10.9bn. Wall Street reacted to the result by marking the shares Dollars  7/8 higher to Dollars 61 3/8 at close of trading. The share price has benefited in recent weeks from the bull market in equities and from an intensive campaign to tell investors and analysts about Goodyear's recovery prospects. The campaign has been led by Mr Stanley Gault, chairman. He said yesterday he was pleased with the earnings improvement, although he acknowledged that worldwide demand for tyres and other motor vehicle products remained weak. He said the company's efforts to contain selling, administrative and general costs was yielding positive results. Goodyear was also helped by lower raw material costs and savings from its restructuring programme. Mr Gault said that during 1991 Goodyear's debt was reduced by Dollars 1bn, to Dollars 2.6bn. This was due to the Alabama asset sale and to the sale of Dollars 582m of Goodyear stock. He said debt and interest costs would decline in 1992 due to further non-tyre asset sales. For all of 1991, Goodyear's tyre division had operating income of Dollars 620.8m, compared with Dollars 463.4m in 1990. Revenues in the division were 2.8 per cent lower at Dollars 9bn. Revenues in the general products division were down by 5.4 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 21 April Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] In relation to the policy coordination being  undertaken by the ruling coalition parties in line with their  selection of a successor to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, a  government source said on the evening of 20 April that as far as  measures to be taken by the government in the event of economic  sanctions being imposed against the DPRK are concerned,  "although they are talking about taking action within the  framework of the Constitution, depending on future developments,  legal amendments may of course become necessary." He thus  indicated that the possibility remains that emergency  legislation may become necessary.    With regard to the increase in the consumption tax rate,  this  source criticized the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  saying: "The SDPJ is terming administrative reform the source of  revenue to cover tax cuts. This is nonsense if you do not have  any concrete proposals."</p>

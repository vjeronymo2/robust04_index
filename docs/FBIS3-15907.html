			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A meeting was held in the Kremlin today between  Russian President Boris Yeltsin and representatives of various  public movements, the Federation Council, Duma factions, and the  government. It was devoted to preparing a draft memorandum on  civic accord and peace. Understandably, an issue of this  importance embraces a whole range of problems, and the crisis in  the fuel and energy complex may be considered a problem of the  first order. This issue was also discussed at the meeting. On  the telephone, especially for Mayak, is Aleksandr Sergeyev,  chairman of the Russian Independent Miners Union.    [Sergeyev] The president said that this morning he signed an  edict on raising the accountability of employers for the  untimely payment of wages. He demanded that the procuracy and  courts take effective steps, and observe the legislation, the  violation of which has taken on massive dimensions in Russia  too. He also said that it was necessary to take immediate  measures to stabilize the banking system and turned to  Chernomyrdin, who was present at this meeting, asking why he was  taking such a long time to make these decisions. That was just  the first reaction of the president to what is going on in the  coal mining regions, and I hope that in the near future edicts  will be published on raising accountability for nonpayment for  fuel and nonpayment by coal consumers, and also raising  accountability for holding up the processing of payments in the  banking system. At least, I got the impression that the  government had already prepared these proposals in principle and  that the question is when it is going to be signed. Despite  this, however, I still feel that the situation remains very  critical, and even the middle of March will be very serious. If  the government does not take measures like these to stabilize  the economic situation the strikes will take on an even more  massive and threatening nature.</p>

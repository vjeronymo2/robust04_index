			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] More than 60 illegal West African immigrants died on  3 February in the cells of Rebouket Camp in Libreville. More  than 220 West African nationals, including 158 Nigerians, 52  Ghanaians, five Togolese, four Senegalese, four Malians, and  some Beninese were arrested at the beginning of the week by the  naval branch of the Gendarmerie as they attempted to enter Gabon  illegally by sea. Held in temporary detention, 60 of them were  discovered dead in the Rebouket Camp cells on 3 February. The  government has been informed of the tragedy. What measures have  the competent authorities taken? Let us listen to Lazare  Digombe, minister of culture, arts, popular education and human  rights, who was interviewed by Charles Mezo.    [Begin Digombe recording] We were informed that there had  been a certain number of deaths at the regrouping center.  According to the reports, when the cells were opened in the  morning, a certain number of the immigrants were found dead. It  is now left to explain how these deaths came about. In this  center, which is not a prison with surveillance structures, you  cannot imagine the gendarmes sleeping in the same place as 200  people. It is unimaginable. We have even learned that one of  the gendarmes who carried water to the immigrants was taken  hostage by them and had to be freed. If you were a gendarme, I  do not think you would accept to spend the night with such  people. That is what you must understand. It is not a prison  with surveillance structures. It is a center where the  immigrants who just happened to turn up unexpectedly were  fortuitously regrouped. We are talking here of illegal  immigrants.    Now that we have learned that a large number of people have  died, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of  Communication, the Ministry of National Defense, and the  Ministry of Human Rights have been informed. How do we explain  the deaths? I told you yesterday, in my address to the nation,  in a press communique on behalf of the government, that an  enquiry has been ordered to determine the causes of these  deaths. None of us was there to see how they died. However some  assumptions have been put forward. Perhaps, a fight broke out  among them. [end recording]</p>

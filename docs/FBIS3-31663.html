			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, Feb. 22 -- President Lech Walesa will  withdraw his representative from the Constitutional Committee of  the National Assembly as well as his own draft constitutional  proposal that has been in the Sejm since the previous term of  office. The president is expected to send a letter to the Sejm  speaker.    The president told PAP on Tuesday that he considered the  Sejm's rejection last Friday of the presidential constitutional  drafts as a no-confidence vote in these drafts.    "It was the parliament that rejected the possibility of  cooperation on the constitution and not myself, I was trying to  cooperate," Walesa stressed.    "I am not taking away the right of parliament to work on the  constitution because I have respect for democracy. But I must  stress that the majority of the nation is outside parliament,  and that even the best constitution which may be drawn up by  this parliament, should be accepted by the majority of the  nation. As president I wanted to have such a majority and win  such an approval," Lech Walesa said.    Next, the president declared he would not discuss the  constitution with the present parliament and added he was not  sure whether he would discuss any other issues, either.    This does not mean a "war at the top," the president  stressed, adding that this reflects "lack of consent to methods  and a warning: Postcommunists are returning to old methods and  the president cannot accept this."    Answering a question whether it was true that he intended to  hold meetings all over Poland, the president recalled that he  was trying to cooperate with the ruling bloc and stressed that  now, when the postcommunists were feeling stronger he was going  to "take them down a peg or two."    "That is why I will be travelling a lot to show that Poland  needs peace and agreement, but not the silence of the  graveyard," Walesa said, adding that "one should watch every day  so that the communists or postcommunists do not take over  everything, as they are willing to do so."    Walesa did not rule out that these meetings might result in  a  conflict with the "postcommunists of today" as he described them.    "If they want such a conflict, I am ready," the president  said but stressed that he was aiming at agreement and a position  of a minority group for the communists as they "are a minority  and must remain as such."    "When they are becoming a majority, they are growing  dangerous. Such is the truth we have experienced. And I am  going to speak about all this during my meetings all over  Poland," the president added.    Asked whether during these meetings he was going to set up  an  organization supporting him, the president said: "If it is  necessary, if the communists are growing too dangerous and there  will be no force to oppose such tendencies, I will have to do it  myself and complete both the vetting and decommunization at  last."</p>

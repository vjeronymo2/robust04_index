			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / UK Company News: PWS increases to Pounds 2.4m despite interest setback PWS Holdings, the insurance and reinsurance broking group, yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m for the year to September 30 on sales up 6 per cent from Pounds 14.4m to Pounds 15.3m. The figures for 1992 have been restated under the FRS 3 accounting standard. This means that the pre-tax profits figure of Pounds 1.2m has been depressed by a charge of Pounds 1.02m related to closure of a subsidiary. Under the previous accounting treatment this was carried as an extraordinary provision of Pounds 683,000. In the 12 months under review, lower interest rates led to a further fall in investment income, from Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.7m. The combined shortfall over the last two years amounts to Pounds 2.3m. PWS International, which specialises in the reinsurance of large individual risks emanating from outside North America and accounts for 71 per cent of group sales, increased its brokerage by 15 per cent to Pounds 10.9m. The final dividend is again 2.5p, making an unchanged total of 4p for the year, on earnings per share of 6.8p (4.4p).</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Pick your angel from the database - In a Nutshell Wealthy private investors - business angels - might be persuaded to back small firms if only there were some way of bringing the two together. This is the thinking behind a feasibility study which is being undertaken by National Westminster Bank to see if a national database of angels could be set up. The bank is carrying out a pilot study in the north-west of England and the Thames valley to see how much time and money investors would be prepared to commit to small firms. Potential investors should contact Peter Ives, NatWest Technology Unit, Fenchurch Exchange, Fenchurch Place, London EC2M 4PB. Tel. 071 374 3734.</p>

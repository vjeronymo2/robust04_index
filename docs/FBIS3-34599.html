			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Numan Ucar, alias Mahir, the </F> commander of the People's Liberation Army of Kurdistan Zhalah  camp in Iraq, in Cologne, Germany, by Behcet Avsar; date not  given]    [Text] [Avsar] What were the aims and results of the  operation launched against Zhalah?    [Ucar] The operation was the most comprehensive air attack  against us. Contrary to claims by the Turkish Government,  Zhalah plays no role in "training and sending guerrillas to  Turkey." The reason for exaggerating the importance of the  Zhalah camp, which has a role of its own, is the impasse in the  war. The aim is to create the impression that our struggle does  not come from inside Turkey, but from abroad. That is why they  decided to attack. Another factor in this attack is the new  alliance forged between Turkey and Israel. This is an alliance  forged by the forces of reaction in the Middle East. This  attack is also a sign that Turkey has become a dangerous factor  in the Middle East and that if need be it could attack the  peoples of the Middle East with the support of imperialist and  reactionary forces.    We knew of the possibility of attack at any time, motivated  by the ill-temper bred by war. So we took additional measures a  few days before the raid. Our forces were constantly alert and  always ready.    The raid started at 0900. As reported, some 50 planes took  part. The second raid came at 1400. This attack too lasted 45  minutes.    With this attack, the Turkish Republic showed that it  represents a threat, not only to our struggle, but to the entire  Kurdish people. While attacking our positions, they did not  forget to attack our people in southern Iraq and eastern Iran.  Seven people were killed and seven others were wounded on our  side.    Four villages were bombed in east Kurdistan. There were nine  to 10 dead and over 20 wounded. Some 50 animals were destroyed.  They attacked every living thing in the region. Two villages  were attacked in south Kurdistan, where five people were killed.  Material damage was also caused to the villages in south  Kurdistan. Claims that "an ammunition dump was blown up" are not  correct. The smoke arose from our five to 10 barrels of fuel.  Some of our tents were destroyed by shrapnel. Normal activity  is continuing in the camp.    [Avsar] Is it true that the leaders' headquarters and  communications room were destroyed?    [Ucar] Our radio broadcasts and wireless communications are  continuing uninterrupted. As for the destruction of leading  cadres: The Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] leading cadres never  stay together in the same region or spot. They are in areas  were fighting is taking place. Besides, the PKK's leading  cadres exist in every locality where we are active.    [Avsar] What was the reaction of the people of south  Kurdistan against the operation?    [Ucar] This is an important issue. Our people around the  camp in south Kurdistan acted with intense dedication. They  acted in a spirit of national unity and solidarity. The people  of south Kurdistan acted in great solidarity fearing that many  of our people might have been hurt. Some 5,000 people gathered  in front of the hospital, where our wounded were taken, to give  blood. Soon after the attack, a convoy arrived to carry our  wounded and martyrs. This attack once more proved that the more  the Kurdish people are attacked, the greater the unity and  solidarity that will be forged.    [Avsar] Why was Zhalah selected for the raid? Did Zhalah  take the place of al-Biqa'?    [Ucar] As you know, the Turkish Government came to office  making great promises. Intense psychological propaganda was  launched: "We will crush the PKK. We will wipe out the PKK by  March 1994." All the tools in the hands of the special warfare  -- including the press, General Staff, president, and the  special governor -- tried to mislead the public by claiming that  the special warfare was succeeding. They also gave clear  guarantees to international forums that they would crush our  struggle by March 1994. But we are close to March and the Army  hasn't struck a blow to our forces nor have the Kurdish people  left Kurdistan, despite the torching of hundreds of villages.  They created the impression that a great blow had been dealt to  us with the closure of our associations in Germany and France.  And recently, they tried to divert attention from the struggle  inside the country by stepping up the propaganda about the  Zhalah camp. By claiming to have destroyed Zhalah, which they  asserted has supplanted al-Biqa', they actually aimed to shore  up their image before the elections. Zhalah camp can never  supplant Mahsum Korkmaz Academy, the PKK's camp in the al-Biqa'  valley. It has assumed no such function.    [Avsar] The press reported that the operation coincided with  the devaluation of the Turkish lira. Do you think it was mere  coincidence for these two events to follow each other so closely?    [Ucar] The operation was due to be launched much earlier.  But it coincided with the devaluation in Turkey. But that's  not all. Despite major scandals and failures in the government,  virtual national unity and covenant, which will last until the  elections, has been forged against our struggle. On the eve of  the election, the regime has surrendered to the military. The  National Security Council makes decisions on the instructions of  the General Staff. Little time remains before the chief of the  General Staff's term expires. All these factors coincided, that  is, the need for the government to raise its morale before the  elections, the intention to draw the people's attention abroad,  and the major economic turmoil were all factors leading to the  operation.    [Avsar] Will you respond to this operation?    [Ucar] Our war, with all the attacks launched so far, has  given the necessary reply. We have no intention of making a  special reply. We will respond by perpetuating, developing, and  intensifying our war.    [Avsar] You told the press that you shot down two warplanes.  What will you say on this subject?    [Ucar] Yes, many Turkish planes were hit during the attack.  We saw one plane fall near the camp. A search is under way to  locate the wreck. There are also claims that helicopters also  took part in the operation. These helicopters too are searching  for the wreckage. Another plane reportedly fell on the Iranian  side, but we are not sure about that second plane.    [Avsar] Reportedly, other operations are also taking place  near Kanimasi and troops have been brought to Dahuk.    [Ucar] We have some information in this regard. We have  received reports that tanks and troops have been massed in  Kanimasi and that the Democratic Party of Kurdistan will  participate in these operations. We have made preparations to  retaliate.</p>

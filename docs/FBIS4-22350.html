			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Vladimir Kucherenko under the rubric "Civil </F> Code": "Property Is Sacred, Contract Is Inviolable"]    [Text] Last week Deputy Chairman of the Supreme Court  of Arbitration V. Vitryanskiy presented to a regular plenary  session of the court a draft of the first chapter of the Civil  Code of the Russian Federation--a constitution of sorts, the  "main law" for the creation of economic regulations.    It was approved in the main by the Presidium of the Russian  Federation Council of Ministers, with proposals from 34  components of the Federation being taken into account. At  present, the Supreme Court of Arbitration intends to submit the  draft to the Duma in an exercise of legislative initiative.    The chapter "General Provisions" envisions fundamental  provisions: norms concerning the exercise and protection of  civil rights, their subjects and objects, transactions,  representation, and statutes of limitation. Many of them are  absolutely new in the legislation in effect.    For example, commercial organizations (except for state and  municipal enterprises) will be endowed with general legal  capacity which will give them the right to engage in all types  of entrepreneurship, provided licensing procedures are complied  with. Uniform procedures for the registration of enterprises and  a state register of legal entities will be introduced. This will  make it possible for everyone to verify the real standing of  their business partners.    Unlike the previous "Law on the Enterprise and  Entrepreneurial Activities," the code recognizes unlimited  companies as legal entities, regulating their status in such a  way as to avoid the passage of additional laws. So-called  limited partnerships are being introduced which have partners  who venture only the contributions made, along with those who  are fully liable. The now confused issues of parent and  subsidiary joint-stock companies will be clarified, and the  notion of dependent companies and structures with mutual  participation in each other's capital will be defined.    A barrier has been erected to the fraudulent use of state  and  municipal enterprises. They will be declared unitary (i.e.,  united, integral); they will not be used for operations not  directly envisioned in their statutes. The state, as well as  state and municipal structures, will be able to participate in  civil relations under the law, being liable for their  obligations with the assets of the treasury.    The legal regimen of the main objects of civil rights has  been defined in detail, especially that of real estate, the  rights to and transactions with which are subject to  registration by the state, including undocumented rights and  transactions that exist in computer memory.    All owners will be given general guarantees of their rights.  However, federal laws can establish specifics of the regulation  of various forms of property. The scope of cases in which the  involuntary taking of property from its owners is permitted, and  then only by a court decision and with preliminary compensation  for the inflicted losses, is circumscribed quite exhaustively.  Arbitrary administrative restrictions of the rights of state  enterprises are ruled out.    It is expected that land legislation will not duplicate the  norms of civil legislation, but will regulate conditions and  procedures for the distribution, use, and protection of land,  proceeding from public and state interests. The fact that  categories of land will appear that cannot be put to other than  the intended use has also been taken into account. Hence the  rules for the confiscation of such parcels from violators with  compensation.    Contracts are another mainstay of a market economy. The new  code regulates in detail the ways to ensure that obligations are  honored: liquidated damages, collateral, suretyship, bank  guarantees, and advance payments.    Mechanisms, both judicial and nonjudicial, for the exercise  of the rights of those to whom property has been pledged have  finally been developed. The pledge of real estate should be  regulated by the future law on mortgages.    The new institution of bank guarantees is being introduced.  It does not depend on the main obligation for securing which it  has been issued. Unlike a surety, the guarantor (a bank, another  credit institution, an insurance organization) may refuse to  honor a creditor's claim only if this claim does not conform to  the terms of guarantee, or was submitted to the guarantor after  the deadline set forth in it.    A number of provisions are aimed at increasing liability for  violating obligations, in particular those associated with  entrepreneurship. Stricter responsibility is envisioned for the  latter when there has been a failure to meet obligations or they  have been met improperly. To avoid liability, an entrepreneur  must prove that the violation was caused by an act of God.    The issue of losses has also been clarified. In determining  their extent, one will have to proceed from the prices and bank  rates that existed either at the moment of voluntary compliance  by the debtor with the demands of the creditor or on the day the  court ruling was made.    Two entire sections are devoted to contracts. Citizens and  legal entities will be free to sign them. The terms of contracts  will be determined by agreement between the parties. However,  cases in which the conclusion of a contract by one of the  parties is mandatory or the content of an agreement is dictated  by legislation will be exceptions.    The pathos of these parts is designed to prevent the  principle of freedom of contracts from resulting in unbridled  arbitrary practices by entrepreneurs, in particular monopolies.  The economically weaker party to the contracts, primarily  consumers and citizens, require protection, too. For this  reason, the code contains the notion of "public contracts." It  applies to relations with the participation of commercial  organizations--retail merchants, owners of public  transportation, energy supply, health care and hotel services,  communications, and so on. Such companies are not entitled to  evade the signing of contracts or grant preferences to certain  individuals in signing contracts.    Procedures for amending and canceling agreements will be  made  stricter in order to make contractual relations stable. A  contract may be amended or canceled upon the demand of one of  the parties by a court decision only if the other party has  substantially violated it.</p>

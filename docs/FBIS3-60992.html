Villagers arriving in the southeastern  provincial capital of Diyarbakir on Tuesday, said that 400  houses in the Cizre district of Dicle had already been evacuated  at gunpoint. They said the remaining 600 houses in the same  district were also being evacuated.    Local officials in Diyarbakir said they had not heard of the  development but would look into claims. Villagers, who refused  to be identified for fear of retaliation, said they too had  applied to local officials but were given no explanation. The  village guards, they said, were brought to Cizre from the  villages of Silopi and had settled down in a nearby  neighborhood. The Cizre district has come to be known as a PKK  stronghold.    Villagers claim that their lives are threatened and that  they  are forced to listen to the guards. The fate of the evacuated  houses is not yet known.</p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: Head of Danish bank retires early Mr Borge Munk Ebbesen, chief executive at Bikuben, Denmark's third-largest bank, is resigning next year, 18 months ahead of his normal retirement date. He will be replaced by Mr Henrik Thufason, currently managing director of the savings bank's data centre. Mr Ebbesen's resignation statement coincided with the publication of a three-year development plan for Bikuben, the country's premier savings bank. The bank aims to increase its core earnings (operating earnings excluding unrealised gains and losses on securities) to DKr750m (Dollars 127.1m) in 1997. This compares with a DKr1.2bn loss in 1993, when the bank carried loss provisions of DKr2.69bn, about 4.7 per cent of outstanding loans and guarantees. In the first half of this year, a cut in provisions to DKr532m from DKr1.68bn in 1993 enabled the bank to report core banking profits of DKr229m, but heavy unrealised losses on the bond and share portfolio meant it reported a first-half net loss of DKr472m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Novi Sad, May 8 (TANJUG) -- Major-General Novica  Simic, commander of the East Bosnia Corps of the Bosnian Serb  army, has said that the Serb corridor must not be jeopardized,  let alone cut, at the Serb town of Brcko because it is the  lifeblood of the Srpska republic. Bosnian Moslems and Croats  have been amassing strong forces towards Brcko these days. The  town of Brcko is located in the narrowest section of the  corridor which links eastern and western parts of the Srpska  republic.    In an interview to the Novi Sad daily DNEVNIK on Sunday,  Major-General Simic reiterated that "Brcko is a Serb town and if  anyone should secure and defend it, it is the Bosnian Serb  Army," adding that the scenario prepared for Sarajevo and  Gorazde was not applicable to Brcko. "We hold Brcko, as well as  the corridor, and there is no price for which we shall allow the  corridor to fall into Moslem hands," the major-general was  adamant.    It is evident that the Moslem leadership wants a repetition  of the "Gorazde incident" so that the Moslem Army could break  through to the River Sava unhindered and cut the corridor with  the help of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR) and  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Major-General  Simic said. Brcko is not Gorazde, he warned, the Bosnian Serb  Army is preparing to counter any possible attacks.</p>

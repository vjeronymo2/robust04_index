			<p>920717 FT  17 JUL 92 / Row over directorships averted SIR Adrian Cadbury, chairman of the Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, has moved to avert a row over his position on whether people should hold more than one non-executive directorship. He said yesterday that there were advantages in holding more than one outside directorship but non-executive directors who held too many posts might not be able to meet the increased demands of the job. Sir Adrian was speaking at a seminar on corporate governance sponsored by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators. He said he was seeking to clarify remarks he made last month suggesting that individuals could not be effective if they accepted more than one non-executive directorship. His comments provoked a storm of protest from many non-executive directors who hold multiple posts. The Cadbury Committee recently issued a report urging a code of best practice for corporate boards of directors which urges a greatly increased role and responsibilities for non-executives. Sir Adrian said yesterday he did not mean to imply in his earlier remarks that it was advisable to hold only one directorship. 'There are advantages in holding more than one outside directorship in terms of the exchange of experience and of making the best of scarce resources,' he said. However, holding too many posts could be a disadvantage. According to Director magazine, published by the Institute of Directors, some non-executives hold up to 10 different directorships. Sir Adrian also urged companies to broaden the pool from which they selected non-executive directors. Candidates might be divisional heads at leading British corporations or come from the public sector.</p>

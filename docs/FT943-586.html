			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Singapore link to extend oil futures trading A move to link oil futures trading in London and Singapore was announced yesterday in a development that will extend trading of the Brent crude oil contract to about 18 hours a day. The International Petroleum Exchange in London and the Singapore International Monetary Exchange said that they would establish a mutual clearing system in which Brent contracts opened on one exchange could be liquidated on the other. An additional benefit would be that members of the respective exchanges would be able to trade on the other without buying a seat on that exchange. Mr Peter Wildblood, the IPE's chief executive, said that the link-up, which is expected to be in place by the second quarter of 1995, 'should eventually broaden the trading base of the Brent contract,' the current daily volume of which is about 50,000 contracts. The co-operative arrangement should ensure 'instant liquidity' in the Singapore market, according to Mr Wildblood. At present there is no Asian benchmark crude that investors in the region can trade in their own time zone.</p>

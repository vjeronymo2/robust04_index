			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: ACP developing countries to seek help from EC AFRICAN, Caribbean and Pacific developing countries are to seek European Community help to revive international cocoa and coffee pacts, Reuter reports from Brussels. The recent collapse of talks on a new world coffee pact followed the failure of negotiations on a new cocoa accord with a withholding scheme to support prices. 'Prices have plummeted since the talks collapsed . . . we are trying to enlist EC support to revive the accords,' General Ghebray Berhane, ACP secretary, said yesterday. The ACP states begin a two-day ministerial meeting in Brussels on Monday. ACP officials said the loss in cocoa and coffee export earnings since 1985 was equal to the Ecu20bn (Pounds 15.75bn) of aid provided under the third and fourth Lome Conventions, (1985-90) and (1990-2000), linking the EC with 69 ACP countries.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Public fund buying lifts Nikkei in final hour BUYING BY public fund managers during the final hour of trading left the Nikkei average firmer, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.  The 225-issue average gained 28.50 at 16,538.68 after moving between 16,374.13 and 16,585.53. Arbitrage selling and profit-taking by foreign investors pushed the index into negative territory for most of the day, but prices finally found support from public buying and arbitrage purchases towards the end of the session. Volume was almost unchanged, at 200m shares against 210m, and declines finally led rises by 572 to 307, with 210 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.42 to 1,264.66 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 0.35 to 1,034.38. Overall trading remained weak, with most investors focusing on reports of corporate mergers and acquisitions. Confirmed reports that Nippon Steel was in talks with Minebea, the ball bearings company, over a transfer of NMB Semiconductor, Minebea's semiconductor affiliate, prompted the Japan Securities Dealers Association to suspend trading of NMB on the over-the-counter market. The association also announced an investigation into possible insider trading of NMB shares after the stock rose to Y958,000 on Wednesday, more than double the traded price in December. Trading volume has surged by more than 40 times since late December. Minebea, the second most active stock on the first section, put on Y3 at Y471, while Nippon Steel edged forward Y1 to Y286. Meanwhile, reports that Ito-Yokado, a supermarket chain, was buying a 29 per cent stake in Isetan, a leading department store, from Shuwa, the ailing stock and property speculator, prompted volatility among retail sector issues. Isetan plunged Y400 to Y1,980, while Ito-Yokado, which later said talks to acquire the stake had fallen through, retreated Y150 to Y3,500. Reports that Matsuzakaya, another department stock held by Shuwa, would be sold next month unnerved investors. Shuwa held stakes in six retailers during the late 1980s but is currently seeing increasing pressure to raise funds to repay its mounting debts. Matsuzakaya dropped by its daily limit of Y200 to Y1,020. Oki Electric was the largest percentage gainer of the day, climbing Y33 to Y365. It is seen as a leading 'restructuring' theme stock, along with Isuzu Motors, which was the day's most active issue, appreciating Y12 to Y360. On the Tokyo SE foreign section, Royal Bank of Canada decided to delist its stock, following five foreign companies that included General Motors, which delisted at the end of last year. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 91.02 to 18,011.77 in volume of 34m shares. Roundup SOME Pacific Rim markets moved ahead as a holiday mood took hold. HONG KONG advanced on selective bargain hunting before the market closed for the Lunar New Year holiday. The Hang Seng index finished the shortened week 37.37, or 0.64 per cent, ahead on the day at 5,914.39, having touched 5,936.15 at one stage after reversing early losses. Turnover stayed slim, at HKDollars 2.34bn against Wednesday's HKDollars 2.48bn, with many local fund managers already on holidays. Swire Pacific 'A' rose HKDollars 1.20 to HKDollars 31 as talks resumed to end the strike at Cathay Pacific, unchanged at HKDollars 9.35. Property shares were sought amid speculation that the 70 per cent residential mortgage cap will be lifted to 90 per cent later this year. SINGAPORE saw foreign demand for blue chip issues which took the Straits Times Industrial index 15.71 higher to 1,593.87 in volume of 63.9m shares. Overall, however, declining issues outnumbered gainers by 111 to 79. The strong close led to expectations that there could be a push into record territory during today's half-day session, ahead of the long weekend break. The current record of 1,607.12 was set in March 1990. Among blue chips, Cerebos ended 14 cents up at SDollars 4.64 after Suntory placed 15m shares at SDollars 4.30 overnight. AUSTRALIA tended lower in thin trading, with a weaker Australian dollar keeping foreign investors away. The All Ordinaries index ended 2.7 off at 1,519.1, after having dipped to 1,514.3 at one stage, in volume that totalled ADollars 198.64m. NAB lost 3 cents to ADollars 7.52 in spite of predictions at the bank's annual meeting of improved profits, while ANZ shed 2 cents to ADollars 3.02 and CBA dipped 5 cents to ADollars 5.85. MANILA climbed in a strong, broadly based rally sparked by the rebound of telephone giant Philippine Long Distance Telephone by 20 pesos to 880 pesos. The composite index rose 21.56 to 1,331.24 for a two-day advance of 48.24. KUALA LUMPUR picked up some early losses to finish mixed, but trading was restricted. BANGKOK saw demand for the big property issues, which pushed the SET index up 4.04 to 965.34, its highest level since November 5.</p>

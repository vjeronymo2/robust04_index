			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / World Bond Markets: New York If the Federal Reserve felt inclined to intervene on behalf of the battered dollar with an interest rate rise, tomorrow's Federal Open Market Committee meeting would be the time to do it. More likely, though, is that the two-day meeting will end without event as policymakers dwell on the state of the US economy, in particular whether the spring lull was followed by a rebound in June - a situation far more likely to prompt monetary tightening in due course. While the dollar continued its collapse against the yen last week, its trade-weighted index remained generally stable. Nor does the Fed seem likely to be panicked by higher commodity prices. Dry weather in the mid-west is one factor behind the rising commodity prices index: as Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette pointed out, monetary policy is a powerful tool, 'but it is difficult to find any examples of higher interest rates prompting precipitation'. The event of the week for the bond market is likely to be Friday's employment report for June. Job numbers are generally expected to be up by around 250,000 but some estimates put the rise at as much as 350,000. A figure at the top end of that range could well set the clock ticking on the next interest rate rise (the following FOMC meeting comes on August 16).</p>

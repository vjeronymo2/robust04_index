			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / The Long View: Freedom to diverge AMID THIS week's confused celebrations of the demise of the European Monetary System the question remains, have European countries carelessly thrown away their anti-inflationary anchor? Will we soon come to think, perhaps the Bundesbank was not so bad after all? And who would have predicted that on the day the structure effectively broke up the bond markets would jump for joy? Inflation, it is true, is not a near-term problem. At present even a substantial devaluation will not stimulate it, as the UK has shown over the past 10 months. But inflation quietly gathers its strength and then springs out again. During the whole period since sterling was floated in 1972 UK inflation has averaged 9.3 per cent a year. If the only thing that has led to the latest slowdown is a high rate of unemployment and an unusual degree of uncertainty in the labour market, we must expect inflation to return when the economy stages a decent recovery. If the worst comes to the worst, Europe is potentially open to an alarming war of low interest rates, competitive devaluations and beggar-my-neighbour economic strategies. But those who persuasively argue that inflation is no longer a problem are winning. In the Western industrialised countries this does indeed seem largely true, for the time being anyway. In the 24 countries that make up the OECD club inflation averaged 3.0 per cent last year and is forecast to slip to 2.8 per cent for 1993. Ironically Germany is one of the worst performers with 4.3 per cent at present, which has been the cause of most of the recent trouble. But look around the world and you will find that money is still far too often a sick joke. In Russia inflation is 20 per cent a month, and in Brazil it is 30 per cent; together these countries have populations approaching that of the EC. In China, with over 1bn people, inflation year-on-year is 14 per cent, if you believe it, and could be accelerating. Such inflation rates in the developing world may serve to explain why the gold price has been climbing even though Western inflation is so subdued. The two worlds, industrialised and developing, are interacting on a much larger scale than in the past, though Japan provided some precedents in barging into the rich men's club a decade or two ago. Fierce price competition in manufactured goods has suppressed inflation in the West and has led to widespread job losses. Overall, growth has remained low enough to leave most commodity prices still weak. Eventually growth, in China in particular, will mop up surpluses, oil being the most obvious candidate for an uncomfortably changed supply-demand balance in a few years in the future. In the East, inflation is still moderately high because of the rapid economic growth rate and the advances in real incomes. There is something of a repeat here of the experience of Japan. Rapid productivity growth in manufacturing meant that stable export prices were combined with relatively rapid internal price inflation: during the 1960s Japanese wholesale prices hardly budged, but consumer prices rose at 6 per cent a year. By the 1980s economic growth had slowed and inflation decelerated. There is the curious case of Hong Kong, a fast-growing offshoot of China which has adopted the US dollar as its currency. Traded goods are priced in dollars, so rapidly rising incomes have to be reflected in surging prices of non-traded domestic services, and whereas the US has inflation of 3 per cent Hong Kong's consumer prices are rising at about 9 per cent. There is no opportunity here to allow the currency to appreciate so that traded goods prices might fall domestically, which in a slightly different context has been happening in Japan over the past year (during which period the yen has appreciated by 41 per cent against the D-Mark). As for Europe, there has been the awkward coincidence of loss of international competitiveness against the newly industrialising countries and the attempt by the Bundesbank to fight internal inflationary shocks through a tight monetary policy and an overvalued D-Mark - imposing the same solution willy-nilly on Germany's EMS partners. One response in Europe could be protectionism, but that impulse has been surprisingly well resisted so far. If labour markets were flexible the real exchange rate could be lowered through real pay reductions, as has happened in the US. But this is not Europe's way. The only other route out of Europe's deflation is through devaluation and sharply lower interest rates. For the time being the inflationary risks of this strategy are being discounted. Bond prices across Europe jumped with the collapse of the EMS, because the implication is that interest rates will fall, and a rise in bond prices is the means by which investors reconcile themselves to lower yields. Both nominal and real bond yields appear to be falling. As long-term interest rates fall the value of assets such as equities and property will tend to rise. This is another reason for gold's come-back, given that the opportunity cost of holding it is falling (although it does not yet have any inflationary hedge appeal for European or US investors). We cannot yet see clearly ahead. The Franco-German dream of European union has collapsed, and economic convergence has halted. As for the inflationary consequences, the problem perhaps is not so much that the answer will be bad as that the answers will be different. Instead of converging on the German level, bond interest rates across the EC must be regarded as potentially much more volatile, and indeed bond yields in the soundest economies, notably France, have the opportunity to stay significantly below those in fiscally troubled Germany. Bond dealers will eagerly welcome this reopening of Pandora's Box; the rest of us will less enthusiastically recognise that we are better off without a straightjacket.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / International Company News: German flotations may rise sharply THERE are between 1,500 and 2,000 German companies likely to go public on the German stock markets in the long term, a leading German banker said yesterday. This prediction, from Mr Ronaldo Schmitz of the Deutsche Bank, compares with about 425 listed German companies at present and suggests that there is potential for the development of Germany's equity markets. It is optimistic in view of a dearth of new issues on the German equity markets. Last year only eight companies came to the market. However, Mr Schmitz, board director in charge of corporate finance at Germany's largest bank, told a conference in Frankfurt yesterday that there were significant hurdles to overcome before there could be a significant rise in the number of new issues. These include better attention being given to the pricing of new issues, tougher rules on minimum requirements for new issue candidates, as well as better investment analysis from the stockbroking community. Mr Schmitz acknowledged that the slowdown in new issues over recent years, down from a peak of 26 in 1990, reflected more than just a deterioration in the German economy or the poor performance of the German stock market. He noted that since the end of the 1980s the price performance of new issues had been markedly worse than for the market as a whole. This had made investors reluctant to take shares in new issues. Mr Schmitz, a former finance director of the BASF chemicals group who is rapidly acquiring a reputation for outspokenness on issues concerning Germany's capital markets, said Germany industry as a whole was undercapitalised compared to international competitors. He said that this was especially true of Mittelstand companies, medium-sized companies which had an average ratio of equity capital to total balance sheet assets of about 20 per cent, compared with over 25 per cent for German companies as a whole and more than 40 per cent for US and UK companies. This shortage of capital could damage companies chances of growth and their competitiveness, Mr Schmitz said, giving them an obvious incentive to come to the stock market. Another impulse to new issues on the German market could come from larger companies spinning off minority holdings in subsidiary companies, a process Mr Schmitz noted was under way at groups such as Metallgesellschaft.</p>

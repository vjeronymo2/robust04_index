			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Tate &amp; Lyle All is not sweetness on Tate &amp; Lyle's board as Mr Stephen Brown's abrupt departure as chief executive testifies. Mr Brown was only at the company for two years. As the architect of Tate's recent success, the chairman, Mr Neil Shaw, is well qualified to fill the breach. Nevertheless, the unhappy episode raises questions about the board's judgment. This year is not a worry: Tate should show reasonable recovery following earlier disappointments. But Tate has yet to prove it has a longer-term growth recipe for its portfolio of mature businesses. A new chief executive would help find an answer.</p>

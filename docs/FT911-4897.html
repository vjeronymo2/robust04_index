			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: CPRE joins lobby to pay farmers for environmental protection SUPPORT for changes in the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, which would pay farmers to protect the environment, is coming from apparently opposed UK lobby groups. The Council for the Protection of Rural England, Britain's largest independent conservation body, is canvassing a concept of environmental land management launched originally by the Country Landowners' Association two years ago. Under both the CLA and the CPRE schemes, farmers would be paid directly for using farming methods and management techniques which enhance the landscape and countryside environment. CPRE support for the CLA ideas comes in documents published before tomorrow's annual UK parliamentary debate on agriculture, although it is set in the wider context of the reform of the CAP. CPRE goes further than CLA by suggesting 'that the bulk of public money paid to the farmers should be tied to the provision of specific environmental benefits, rather than, as at present, the production of food . . . Such direct payments should eventually come to replace price-support mechanisms.' The CLA scheme is set in a private enterprise context with farmers and landowners contracting with governments or local authorities to provide specific environmental benefits, such as greater access to the countryside or the management of areas of special beauty. The two schemes are among many ideas currently being debated on the future of European farming. At the centre of the debate are the EC Commission's own proposals to shift the burden of subsidies from large food producers to small farmers across Europe. The proposals have so far been opposed by Britain in particular. CPRE, 25 Buckingham Palace Road, London SW1 WOPP. Total income from UK farming fell by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 2.1bn in 1990, the Ministry of Agriculture said in an annual report on farm incomes. This compares with a 21 per cent increase in 1989. Falling incomes from cattle, sheep and dairy outweighed a recovery by specialist cereal, general cropping and intensive livestock farmers.</p>

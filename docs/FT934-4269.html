			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / UK Company News: YRM shares fall on profit warning Shares in YRM fell a further 2p to 19p yesterday after the building design consultancy announced that its results for the six months to October 31 would be significantly below current market expectations. It said that trading conditions had remained extremely difficult and further cost and overhead reductions had accordingly been made. On Thursday the shares shed 8p, which the company said it understood was the result of a small volume of selling in the market. For the year to April 30 YRM incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.98m.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Pennsylvania definition allows applicants that were once one type of entity but that are now a different type of entity, either as a result of a merger, consolidation or a reorganization, to become self-bonded so long as one of the entities was in existence for 10 years. The Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.23(b)(2) requires a self-bonding applicant to be in continuous operation for a period of not less than 5 years immediately preceding the self-bond application. Events beyond the control of the applicant and not affecting its continuance as an entity may be excluded. The purpose behind the Federal rule was to ``show the business entity's intent and ability to remain in operation and undertake the subsequent mining and reclamation.'' 48 FR 36418, 36420 (August 10, 1993). Thus, it appears that Pennsylvania's use of its definition may not fulfill the purpose of the Federal rule if the new entity was not in existence for at least 5 years. However, this definition if taken in concert with sections 86.159(b)(5), (c)(4), and (j), which are discussed below, insures as much as the 5-year continuous business operation requirement does, that the applicant will be in existence to complete the mining and the subsequent reclamation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 86.159(b)(5), which requires that the applicant must have honored in the last 3 years all of its self-bonding obligations and section 86.159(b)(6), which prohibits the acceptance of an applicant whose surety bonds were canceled for nonpayment of premiums, fraud or failure to comply with the terms of the surety bond, are both indicators of a history for compliance with bonding obligations and as such are good indicators of a continuance in the future of complying with such obligations. Section 86.159(c)(4), which requires an applicant to certify that it will maintain its corporate status for at least 5 years, is more than just a statement because this certification is subject to criminal penalties for false swearing. Section 86.159(j), which requires the applicant, on a sliding scale of liability and net worth, to submit a security interest to Pennsylvania is an expression of confidence of the company that it expects to be in existence for the term of the permit and to have the security interest which was proffered to the State, released. Therefore, based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the definition of ``continuous business operation'' in conjunction with the above-noted sections is no less effective than 30 CFR 800.23(b)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> d. Current asset. Pennsylvania is proposing a new definition to mean cash or other assets which are reasonably expected to be converted to cash or sold or consumed within 1 year or within the normal operating cycle of the business. The Director finds that the proposed definition is substantively identical to and no less effective than the Federal definition of ``current asset'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> e. Current liability. The State proposes this definition to mean an obligation which is reasonably expected to be paid or liquidated within 1 year or within the normal operating cycle of the business. The Director finds that the proposed definition is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``current liabilities'' at 30 CFR 800.23(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> f. Disclaimer of opinion. The State proposes this definition to mean a statement by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) that he does not express an opinion on the financial statements of the applicant. Pursuant to section 86.159(g), an application will be rejected if a disclaimer of opinion is expressed by the CPA. There is no counterpart Federal definition for this term. However, the EPA discussed this term when it was proposing financial responsibility for owners of underground petroleum storage tanks. While EPA's discussions are not controlling on OSM's decision, it is helpful. EPA stated that a disclaimer of opinion meant that ``the auditor does not express an opinion on the firm's financial statement. Auditors issue disclaimers of opinion of their examinations of a firm's financial statements have been limited in some way or if there are uncertainties regarding the firm's financial statements.'' 52 FR 12786 (April 17, 1987). The Director concludes that application of this definition will assist Pennsylvania in determining whether or not the applicant is a suitable candidate for self-bonding. Therefore, the Director finds this definition not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> g. Financial statement. The State is proposing a new definition to mean a formal report of the applicant's status of accounts at a particular time, prepared to show the operating results and financial condition of the applicant's business. The term includes, but is not limited to, the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of change in financial position prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. There is no counterpart Federal definition for this term. However, the State's definition follows basic accounting principles. Therefore, the Director finds the proposed definition to be not inconsistent with the requirements of SMCRA and the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> h. Fixed asset. The State proposes that this term includes plants and equipment, but does not include land or coal in place. Since this proposed rule is substantively identical to the Federal definition of ``fixed asset,'' the Director finds that it is no less effective than the Federal rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. Independent certified public accountant. Pennsylvania proposes this definition to mean a certified public accountant not dependent on or subject to the direct control of the applicant. There is no counterpart Federal definition. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with 'Abd-al-Basit Sabdarat, minister of culture </F> and information, by Kamal Hasan Bakhit in Khartoum; date not  given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bakhit] Sudanese-U.S.  relations are facing a continuing crisis. The United States  always confronts Sudan at international forums. Indeed, it  endorses the Sudanese statement opposing the government. The  question is: What does the United States want from Sudan? Are  there any non-Sudanese forces behind the hardline U.S. stand  toward the Sudanese Government?    [Sabdarat] First of all, the United States wants Sudan to  abandon its cultural awakening plan. After the collapse of the  socialist camp, the United States now believes that it is a real  danger to have Islam as the second major power after the United  States. In other words, the United States believes that the  power of Islam and Muslims cannot but be the second major power.  Therefore, it is in principle against Islam. In fact, the  United States is against religions because its real religion is  materialism. So, it does not want Islam to be the alternative  to the capitalist collapse, which will eventually afflict the  Western camp as it afflicted the socialist camp. The United  States believes that Sudan is the model for a new Islamic state,  one that is different from those Islamic states in which Islam  is a mere facade -- just the way the United States wants it to  be. Therefore, killing this model has become the main concern  not only of the United States but also of Britain, which is more  hostile, and of Western countries, in general.    I believe that the issue of Bosnia is an example of this  inclination. These Western countries do not at all want the  establishment of a fully Islamic state in the middle of Europe.  They also do not want an Islamic state in the middle of Africa  or the Middle East or in strategic places anywhere in the world.  Hence, the United States' hostility toward Sudan does not target  a certain party, it is a continuous and blatant hostility toward  Islam. It is also a conflict of cultures. This is a well known  conflict, even though it remained hidden in many occasions.  However, it now began to emerge in its real blatant form.    [Bakhit] How do you explain the stand of Aldo Ajo Deng,  former deputy speaker of the parliament, in terms of seeking  political asylum in Britain and in terms of joining the  opposition?    [Sabdarat] I believe that Aldo Ajo became convinced that his  generation has no place in Sudan after he saw that rulers of  Sudanese regions and commissioners comprise a new generation.  He saw that his generation, which created part of the Sudanese  movement, has a weak future. Moreover, he had an ambition of  becoming the vice president. However, he found out that a young  man from the new generation would take that position. Then, he  and others were subject to many temptations. He believed other  people's talk about an approaching end to this regime. He  succumbed to pressures and followed the road he is on now.    [Bakhit] What are your expectations about the talks to  achieve peace?    [Sabdarat] I always believe that sitting at a dialogue table  is a sound start. However, it is not always certain that those  who sit around this table will end up achieving peace. The  available facts confirm that the rebel movement has no  alternative to dialogue. After it has been encircled, the rebel  movement cannot achieve any goal on the military level.  Practically, the movement cannot depend on the outside world in  order to separate the south because this issue is also an issue  of war. The separation of southern Sudan cannot be achieved by  a UN decision. Even if the United Nations and the entire world  imposed this, the south would remain part of Sudan. Sudan has  sacrificed thousands of martyrs for the sake of maintaining its  unity. The issue remains inflamed and the war continues.  Therefore, I believe that the movement is at its weakest and  its only means of saving face is peace. This is especially true  since the model we are establishing now is a practical model.  We are making real peace on the ground in Bahr al-Ghazal, the  Upper Nile, and vast parts of Sudan's Equatoria. We are doing  so through development and work so that the model of peace  inside Sudan will be that of real peace. I believe that if the  rebel movement understands these facts, peace can be achieved.    [Bakhit] However, the government has constants that cannot  be  shaken and so does the rebel movement. The question is: How  can peace be achieved? Don't you think that the issue will turn  into a useless dialogue?    [Sabdarat] First of all, the rebel movement does not have  any constants. At one time, it talked about a federation, then  about a confederation, and later about self-determination  (separation). Now, it is talking about sharing authority and  wealth. Hence, there constants are tactical. We will not  change our own constants, which stipulate that Sudan is one  united country and that a federation is the ideal model for rule  in Sudan. Therefore, I believe that when the rebel movement  demands its right to self-determination, it is asking for the  maximum in order to achieve the minimum of what it wants.    [Bakhit] A short time ago, the government announced that two  foreign military aircraft penetrated Sudan's airspace, What is  the story behind this? In other words, how true is this?    [Sabdarat] The truth is that two warplanes flying at an  altitude parallel to that of civil airplanes were monitored.  Some quarters and Arab and foreign ambassadors were informed  about this. There is an ongoing investigation to find out the  identity of these warplanes and their objectives. [passage  omitted]</p>

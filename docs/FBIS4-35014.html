			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jesus Rangel M.] </F>   [Text] The Bank of Mexico [Banxico] does not intend to  devalue the peso in relation to the dollar or alter its monetary  and exchange policy. In addition, the bank will handle interest  rates, exchange rates, international monetary reserves, and  other variables to counter exchange market speculation brought  about by the political climate and international financial  instability.    The bank says it has not changed its pledge to the Congress  on monetary policy, according to which, at the end of the year,  the difference between the lower and upper limits of the  floating rate would be 13.9 percent with a daily decrease of  0.0004 and the exchange rate would close at 3.4760 pesos.    Official and private sources have reported that  international  monetary reserves at present exceed $26 billion, more than $1.5  billion above the figure at the end of 1993, and that reciprocal  credits, which were granted by Canada and the United States to  shore up Mexico's monetary stability and which are worth nearly  $7 billion, have not yet been used up.    The sources said that, despite difficult circumstances,  political concerns, in particular, the flow of foreign capital  into the country remains constant and that this situation will  continue as long as the macroeconomy remains steady. This has  helped keep the interbank exchange rate within the limits of the  central bank's intervention guidelines.    The bank reports that, until 11 June, government securities  in circulation -- treasury certificates [cetes], federal  government development bonds [bondes], treasury bonds  [tesobonos], and adjustment bonds [ajustabonos] -- and in the  hands of foreign investors amounted to 76.791 billion new pesos,  the largest amount since 5 April and the equivalent of 31.81  percent of the total. In addition, stocks of Mexican enterprises  operating abroad continue to be bought in the stock market.    In the past 15 days, Banxico has countered speculation on  the  Mexican peso, mainly through interest rates and the issuance of  treasury certificates and bonds for amounts below the investors'  demand, as was observed in the most recent two auctions.    The Bank has allocated larger amounts of the issuances less  in demand, those to mature in 28, 182, and 364 days. Also, the  bank applies a mixed policy regarding interest rates; it lowers  the rates on short-term issuances and maintains or raises them  slightly on the issuances that mature in 182 and 364 days. A  small amount has been made available for the more popular  issuances, those that mature in 91 days. Furthermore, the bank  lowers or raises the interest rate with these instruments as  necessary to control speculation. The yield rate of treasury  bonds has even been reduced.    The trend toward stability in financial markets was  disrupted  by Luis Donaldo Colosio's assassination on 23 March. Since then,  the bank has used either an interest rate policy -- the Bank  even establishes ceilings -- higher exchange rates within the  flotation rate, monetary reserves, or other variables to deal  with instability and speculation.    The sources consulted also described as wild the devaluation  suggestions presented by economist Rudiger Dornbusch because,  the sources said, this policy is not necessary to increase  exports and because the dollar's devaluation regarding other  currencies improved the competitiveness of Mexican exports to  Europe, Asia, and Japan.    Banxico pointed out that its main goal is to strengthen  monetary stability, that the effect of a devaluation would be  more negative than positive, and that such a move would create  considerable mistrust among the economic agents and the people  in general. The Bank closely monitors the status of foreign  markets and their effects on the local market in order to  counteract any incoming turbulence, particularly because of the  departure of large speculative capital from repercussions, in an  operation that seeks to make quick profits, especially in  emerging markets.</p>

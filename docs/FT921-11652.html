			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour fears over election resources - Party finances THE HECTIC pace of recent campaigning has aroused fears that Labour has been forced to dip into funds set aside for the general election, raising fresh questions about its capacity to finance up to five more months of flat-out electioneering. The party's concerted attempts to regain the political initiative have meant it has overshot projected spending levels, according to one senior party official. Although the statement was dismissed as 'not true' by Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's campaign co-ordinator, other senior party figures admitted that hard decisions would soon have to be made. Labour said last month its campaign war-chest exceeded its Pounds 6m target, but this is likely to be dwarfed by a Tory fighting fund estimated at Pounds 20m. In 1990 - the latest figures available - Labour withdrew Pounds 570,000 from its general election fund, using the money mainly to employ 'temporary' organisers 'covering areas of the country crucial to our success at the next general election'. This did not prevent the fund more than doubling in size to Pounds 2.6m from Pounds 1.26m a year earlier. However, the party's general fund clocked up a 1990 loss of Pounds 289,000 against a projected break-even.</p>

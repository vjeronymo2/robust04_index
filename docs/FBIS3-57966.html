			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Fabio Martini: "Suddenly, Occhetto Dumps Ciampi"] </F>   [Text] The PDS [Democratic Party of the Left] leader  is also urging the government to resign, after Bossi had  previously done so. "It no longer has a majority," he says.  Scalfaro says, however: "Part of our journey has already been  completed."    Rome--In the final hours of 1993, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has  suddenly found himself all alone. Now Occhetto has also urged  the government to resign, after Bossi had previously done so.  "In view of the no-confidence motion introduced by Pannella,"  the PDS leader says, in an interview he gave to L'UNITA, "it  would be entirely correct for Ciampi to take note of the fact  that he no longer has a majority, and to bring to the attention  of the head of state the inferences derived from that fact." It  is, therefore, no surprise that the two wings of the government  majority are coming unhitched and that in the space of 48 hours  Carlo Azeglio Ciampi passed from the laurels of his year-end  press conference to face the unexpected prospect of having to  resign and accordingly face the election campaign under the  leadership of a greatly weakened executive branch rather than  one with full powers, as he had so profoundly desired.    The first to detach himself was Bossi who, after Pannella's  no-confidence motion was introduced, changed his position three  times in four days. He initially favored the motion but  subsequently opposed it (fearing that it would delay the date of  the election), and then two days ago he again changed course.  "We shall vote for the no-confidence motion," Maroni--the  deputies' chairman--announced, "because in view of the measures  concerning RAI [Italian Radio and Television Broadcasting  Corporation] and IRI [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction],  the government should be terminated as soon as possible!" Other  than the reasons given publicly, the Lega is backing off in  order not to become involved in the year-end "blow" decided on  by Ciampi, who is thereby resuming his opposition role again.  Having seen which way the wind is blowing, Occhetto also cut  himself loose and in his interview sent a message--if one reads  between the lines--to whoever needed to receive it. "We voted  for the budget bill," he said, "because of the need for  stability, but there is another requirement for stability that  needs to be satisfied: that of selecting the two houses of  Parliament as quickly as possible." As if to say: Dear Scalfaro,  dear Ciampi, we have done our part; now let's hurry up and hold  the elections.    In this way, as the days pass, the political reasoning  behind  the no-confidence motion introduced by Marco Pannella--which was  destined to sow contradictions and uneasiness in all  camps--becomes ever clearer, especially for the PDS, which in  anticipation of the 12 January parliamentary debate has seen a  curious scenario take shape on the horizon. Since Bossi opted  out two days ago, many deputies of the DC [Christian Democratic  Party] and the PSI [Italian Socialist Party] have already let it  be known that they will vote against the government. There was  accordingly the possibility that the debate on the Pannella  motion could conclude with a Ciampi propped up by the PDS and  half of the DC, with the rest of Parliament taking shots at him.  The motion has proved to be a big headache, and it is of no use  for Occhetto to say that "it might be withdrawn." In view of the  abundant fruit yielded by his "provocation," Pannella will do  everything except withdraw his motion, and nothing will remain  for Occhetto to do but dismiss Ciampi who, after he has resigned  at the conclusion of the debate, would then have to go to the  head of state, wherepon--the PDS leader says--"Scalfaro would  have to go ahead and dissolve Parliament."    This evening, in his year-end message, Scalfaro will  announce  that the elections will be speeded up, but without setting a  date. Meanwhile, the head of state broadcast a message yesterday  to Italians living abroad in which--among other things--he  "apologized" for the fact that they will be unable to vote in  the coming elections, and concluded on a hopeful note. "So many  people," he said, "have helped to make it possible for us to be  in better shape at the end of this difficult year! Indeed, part  of our journey has already been completed."</p>

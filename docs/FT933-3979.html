			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Enso to dispose of Italian unit ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, has agreed to sell an 81 per cent stake in its Italian-based packaging company Tambox CCC to the Dutch group Esswell Packaging. Enso declined to reveal the terms of the deal but it said that the sale of the loss-making operation would not affect its 1993 results. The company only acquired the subsidiary in April this year, as part of its purchase of Tampella Forest and Tambox Europe. Tambox CCC operates three paperboard mills and three corrugated box plants in Italy, with net 1992 sales amounting to FM400m (Dollars 69.8m). Enso said that it wished to sell the unit because it did not fit geographically with its other corrugated box manufacturing operations in Sweden and Finland. The company is to retain a 19 per cent stake in the subsidiary to reflect its role as a leading raw material supplier to the European corrugating industry. Esswell Packaging is the holding company for a privately-owned group of corrugated box companies in Spain, France, the Netherlands and Germany.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Groznyy, 12 June (CHECHENPRESS-TASS) -- The Chechen  Ministry of Foreign Affairs has refuted accusations that  president Dzhokhar Dudayev was responsible for the collapse of  the talks with Russia. In a statement issued today by  CHECHENPRESS, the Foreign Ministry of Chechnya says that  "Groznyy has never received any proposals or documents from the  Russian leadership for the forthcoming talks," and therefore the  Chechen leadership "strongly refutes the accusations that it has  undermined the allegedly planned talks." The document also  states that "the Chechen Republic is willing to start talks with  the Russian Federation only on the principles of equality, with  no preconditions, and only if Russia abandons the policy of  state terrorism."    The CHECHENPRESS report says that the Chechen Foreign  Ministry has been provoked to issue the statement because  "Russian mass media has published reports in which officials  from the administration of the Russian President and from the  Ministry for Nationalities and Regional Policy are blaming  Dzhokhar Dudayev, president of Chechnya, for the collapse of the  allegedly planned talks between the Chechen Republic and the  Russian Federation."</p>

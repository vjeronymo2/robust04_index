			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Technology: Putting mildness to the test - Worth watching A range of tests traditionally used to determine the toxicity of chemicals has now been applied by UK chemists Boots to determine the mildness of its latest babycare range. Working with chemists at Nottingham University, Boots has used in vitro (test-tube) testing of both the components and the final products. Included in the six tests, for example, is a fluoroscein leakage test, in which living cells are used as a barrier to prevent a dye leaking through a grid. By measuring the extent of the leakage once the product is added, scientists can test the damaging potential of the product. The bath products, shampoo, lotion, nappy cream and baby wipes were measured for their damaging effect on the skin and the recovery rate of the skin after use. Boots: 0602 418522.</p>

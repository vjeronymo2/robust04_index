			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Leading Article: Eastern promise THE EUROPEAN Commission is at last taking the challenge of central and eastern Europe seriously. To their credit, Sir Leon Brittan, commissioner for external economic relations, and Mr Hans van den Broek, commissioner for external political relations, have proposed accelerated trade liberalisation and a 'clear commitment to eventual membership'. To its credit, the Commission as a whole has agreed. The heads of government meeting in Copenhagen next month need to show that they deserve some credit too. The grudging approach taken by the EC to trade with Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Slovakia has been little short of scandalous. Concern about the fate of a few EC industries has been allowed to outweigh a strategic EC interest. The role of liberal trade agreements with central and eastern Europe is more than to offer increased opportunities for exports. Such agreements are also a way to strengthen market oriented reform. When the EC itself sets a protectionist example, however, the legitimacy of reform is undermined in countries suffering from a far more painful adjustment than anything in prospect for the EC. According to an article by Jim Rollo and Alastair Smith in the latest issue of Economic Policy, between 33 per cent (for Romania) and 58 per cent (for Hungary) of the pre-transition EC imports from central and eastern Europe were in categories it deems sensitive. Even under the 'Europe agreements' signed in 1992, these sensitive categories - processed foods, textiles, clothing, footwear, steel and chemicals - remain subject to tight protectionist measures. A vision has been needed. The Commission's proposals, while imperfect, provide this. The heads of EC governments need to show they can see it too. They need to show the EC can still respond to challenges. Nothing on the Copenhagen agenda is likely to be as amenable to effective action as these proposals. Nothing is likely to be more important either.</p>

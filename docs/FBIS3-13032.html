'Arafat Is  Right, the Massacre was a Conspiracy'" -- first paragraph is LA  STAMPA introduction]    [Text] Moza Illit -- Matti Peled, the general who does not  want the war, lives on the mountain on the road to Tel Aviv. It  is a quiet house located among the pine trees; the stone bust of  Theodor Herzl on a natural balcony overlooks a green slope.  "Sheket, be good," the general told the dog baring its teeth to  the visitor. The air is good, there is peace around. Peled is  70; he was a Haganah "terrorist" and one of the generals during  the Seven-Day War; but later he became a leader of the  Israeli-Palestinian Peace Council. He has a nice open face,  light eyes, and still talks straight, the way the military do.  He went straight to the heart of the problem that is breaking  Israel's heart. "'Arafat is right, Goldstein was not an  isolated madman. The mosque massacre was the result of a  conspiracy."    [Candito] Rabin says it was not and insists that Goldstein  was the only one to open fire.    [Peled] Goldstein opened fire inside the mosque; but others  were firing outside at the same moment. There were 250 injured,  and a great deal more than the 30 deaths reported by the  government.    [Candito] Rabin says that "the majority of the families"  with  dead relatives in the mosque have been questioned.    [Peled] What does "the majority" mean? A great many families  of Palestinians killed in clashes with the police rush to bury  them once they have ascertained their death to avoid a request  for an autopsy. Rabin's police counted 30 bodies for autopsy,  but perhaps just as many were buried secretly and in a hurry,  perhaps even more.    [Candito] What about a conspiracy?    [Peled] Goldstein did not act alone. That is the first  point. Second: The two policemen whose duty it is to check at  the entry to the mosque that the settlers' rifles are not loaded  arrived more than half an hour late that Friday. And this is  very fishy: Goldstein had been saying for almost two years that  he wanted to eliminate a lot of Palestinians. Remember also  that the soldiers guarding the entrance to the mosque live in  Qiryat Arba', in other words, they live in the same village as  Goldstein. Finally: Why so much haste to clean away all traces  of the massacre from the mosque?    [Candito] Is there also complicity on the government's part?    [Peled] There is a very suspicious combination of lies. In  any event, governmental connivance with the settlers' extremist  positions has never been far away: Throughout all these months  of reflection, the settlers launched Operation Double, which  consisted of doubling the size of the settlements, as if there  had never been any accord with the Palestinians. They set up  tents and built walls, and the government let them do it.    [Candito] What should the government have done?    [Peled] Wipe out everything, with force, to show one side  and  the other, the settlers and the Palestinaians, that it meant  business. The government made a mistake: It should have  proceeded as quickly as possible and delivered Gaza and Jericho  to the Palestinians within six months, and then discuss the rest  later.    [Candito] Whereas?    [Peled] Whereas instead, it harped on about the most  insignificant things, wasting time and losing credibility. Just  think, when the Israeli delegation turned up to discuss the  points that Rabin wanted to clarify, it had a 55-page dossier  that made the Palestinians' eyes boggle. Generals in their  prime were called upon to discuss methods that a simple customs  officer could have resolved.    [Candito] There is bad faith then?    [Peled] In reality, Rabin wants to be freed from the Oslo  accord and then be able to rewrite it as he pleases. You know  what the crux of the matter is? It is that the Palestinians see  the Oslo accord as the first step in a project leading to the  birth of an independent state, while Rabin sees the Oslo  signature as a process that will end up with partial  independence: That is why he combats even the smallest signs of  sovereignty: the flag, a bank, a currency, the stamp on a  passport.    [Candito] Does he envisage something resembling the old  Allon  plan.    [Peled] Rabin never talks of this plan but he always thinks  about it. It is the old project of maintaining all the  settlements that are considered to be strategic and to cede the  rest of the Territories to a Jordanian-Palestinian management  under the sovreignty of King Husayn. And Husayn would not be  opposed to the idea either.    [Candito] We are going back in time.    [Peled] Yes, but in the worst possible way. The truth is  that we should have made peace with the Arabs 25 years ago, when  we won the Seven-Day War: We were strong, victorious, sure of  ourselves, while the Arabs had been beaten; they were weak and  divided. At that time I said: Let us cede the West Bank to the  Palestinians and give them their independence, then they  themselves will be our best protection against all the other  Arabs. I remember I always used to quote Churchill: "In  victory, magnanimity." Instead we were proud, presumptuous, and  convinced that we could keep the whole world at bay, and we did  not give a damn. They called me a traitor. Of course the years  between 1967 and 1973, that is, until the Yom Kippur war, were  happy years. I remember that we used to go on carefree picnics  to Ramallah or to Hebron; then Yom Kippur brought us back to  reality.    [Candito] Is it still too late?    [Peled] In politics it is never too late. But of course in  making that decision we built a very conservative society that  is different from the one we wanted and could have built. Also,  the young people are also growing up with this mentality: The  three years' military service they have to perform when they  turn 18 forces them to be in a hurry, to want to snatch  everything immediately: family, university, work. Poor young  people, what they miss out on is their youth. Take the  university for example: Young people hate books, which they see  as a waste of time; all they want is a professor to explain the  lesson and their notes are all they need. They have no time to  really study, to understand, to meditate.    [Candito] Goldstein is the son of this type of society which  has no desire to understand. We foreigners see in the  collective pyschology of Israel a dramatic ethos of complicity  with religious and nationalistic extremism.    [Peled] Certainly. The truth is that the extremists are  everything that we would have wanted to be: They are the "real  Jews" and if we are different it is only because of the  cohabitation problem, not because of an ideological choice.  They are never condemned on moral or ideological grounds, they  simply make unrealistic judgements.    [Candito] Can ethical complicity also be political  complicity?    [Peled] The resolution that Rabin presented condemning the  Goldstein case was made to win the votes of the religious  parties. He made a choice. He could have had the vote of the  Arab representatives, and he would certainly have been closer to  the truth of the facts. But he did not want to.    [Candito] Where will this lead us?    [Peled] Certainly not to a meeting with the Palestinians.    [Candito] Is there still hope for peace?    [Peled] When I shook 'Arafat's hand 10 years ago everybody  called me a traitor and they passed a law in the Knesset. Today  Peres and Rabin are shaking hands. Times are changing, we must  have the strength to adapt.    [Candito] Will Rabin succeed?    [Peled] It is difficult to say. I fear that his hopes, his  vanity will get the better of him. He is already looking to the  1996 elections, when the prime minister will be elected under  the new system. He already sees himself as premier in the year  2000, whereas what we need is a policy of courage, the desperate  strength of daring.</p>

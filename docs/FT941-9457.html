			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Cold threatens further chaos Temperatures will be very low again this morning after sub-zero temperatures and driving winds caused chaos for travellers yesterday, forecasters warned. The south of England was worst hit. British Rail said that further cold weather would hamper normal services. Trains south of the Thames into London yesterday were delayed by up to 30 minutes. Bad weather affected the south-west, mid-Wales and the midlands, and more snow was expected in Hampshire, Dorset, Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire, Sussex and the Isle of Wight. More than 26,000 motorists, three times the daily average, suffered mechanical breakdowns yesterday, motoring organisations said. The conditions also led to a 50 per cent increase in traffic accidents, said the RAC. In the London area alone, there were 449 incidents, 168 of them resulting in serious injuries. British Airways said it cancelled more than 40 short-haul flights from Heathrow, and warned passengers to European destinations to check their flight details. Forecasters said there should be a thaw later today and said temperatures should climb above freezing by the end of the week. Weather, Page 18</p>

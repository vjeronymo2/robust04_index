			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Jocelyne Zablit] </F>   [Excerpts] Paris, April 12 (AFP) -- The evacuation of  foreigners from strife-torn Rwanda continued Tuesday [12 April]  as various embassies shut down their operations there amid  reports of rebel troops closing in on the capital Kigali and  ongoing tribal bloodletting. [passage omitted]    The Belgian defence Ministry, for its part, announced that  nearly 400 evacuees, mainly Belgians, had arrived at Brussels  airport Tuesday from Nairobi.    They were flown in on two planes, one carrying 195 people --  186 Belgians and nine people of other nationalities, and another  carrying 204 people, 158 of them Belgian.    The defense ministry said a total of 446 Belgians had fled  Rwanda, a former Belgian colony, and about 1,000 others remained  behind. It was impossible to know how many of those wanted to  be evacuated, the ministry said.    It added that the Belgian evacuation operation, being  conducted by Belgian troops, should be completed within three or  four days. Belgians made up the largest group of foreign  nationals in Rwanda, with more than 1,500 living there.    Another flight from Nairobi, carrying 400 people, was  expected in Brussels early Tuesday afternoon.    In Paris, meanwhile, the foreign ministry said two flights  from Bangui were expected later Tuesday carrying about 55 French  nationals and 30 people of other nationalities.</p>

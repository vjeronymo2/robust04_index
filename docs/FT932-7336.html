			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Protest fear over Bonn's asylum bill vote DEMONSTRATORS are expected to gather in Bonn today and tomorrow to protest against the German parliament's plan to change the constitution and curb the influx of asylum seekers. An additional 3,000 policemen and border guards will patrol the city to prevent the protest turning to violence ahead of the parliamentary vote, due tomorrow. The government said that it feared trouble after learning that extreme left-wings groups had vowed to prevent the parliament from voting. Some 10,000 people are expected to take part in the demonstration. The largest protest action will be headed by Support Action for Asylum, an umbrella organisation gathering together various church groups, the Greens, the small German Socialist party, and movements against racism. The demonstrators are protesting against changing article 16 of the German constitution which grants any refugee the right to seek asylum in the country. However, the parliament is expected to vote for an amendment allowing asylum-seekers to be sent back over the German border to third countries such as Poland and the Czech republic. The constitutional amendment, which requires the support of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in parliament, was drawn up after two years of heated debate over Germany's liberal asylum rights. Since the beginning of the year, some 150,000 refugees have applied for asylum. Eighty per cent of the asylum seekers entered Germany from Poland or the Czech republic. SPD leaders have appealed to their party's MPs to vote in favour of the proposal. But a strong minority of left-wing deputies is fiercely objecting to the amendment. The SPD parliamentary whip, Mr Peter Struck, says there are about 100 rebels among the SPD's 259 deputies in parliament. This is too few to block the bill, for which Chancellor Helmut Kohl needs only about 45 SPD votes. They argue that countries such as Poland and the Czech republic do not have the infrastructure to house large numbers of refugees and lack the legal environment to ensure fair asylum proceedings. Germany and Poland recently signed an agreement to allow refugees to be sent back across the border.</p>

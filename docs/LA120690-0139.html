			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE CORNER BAR: A QUIET RETREAT? WELL, NOT QUITE  </P> <P> Only an idiot would recommend that you go to a mall for the fun of it at this  time of year.  </P> <P> Well. . . .  </P> <P> Just call me Stupid.  </P> <P> But I do have your best interests at heart.  </P> <P> First, a disclosure: This type of mall pleasure involves drinking and acting  superior. It shouldn't be attempted by people who think the holidays are the  time for goodwill toward man.  </P> <P> Something else to confess: I have never understood nor appreciated the concept  of bars in malls. They usually serve as kennels for the other half -- those  non-shopping spouses who are wasting away until closing time, not knowing that  killing time in malls was the reason that Sharper Image stores were invented.  </P> <P> Most mall bars are also tucked away inside random family-oriented restaurants,  far from the madding crowds. This wipes out the people-watching factor, which  could be one of the best reasons to go to a heavy-traffic area to imbibe  instead of a cloistered bar closer to home.  </P> <P> Thankfully, there is a mall bar that offers sightseeing as a chaser.  </P> <P> Perched a few feet above the slipperly main drag of Crystal Court, across from  South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa, is Gianni, an Italian restaurant with a bar  that offers a Kodak view of the frantic masses.  </P> <P> Its red and black decor looks like some kind of giant starting flag, signaling  weary mallers to begin partaking of holiday cheer.  </P> <P> Some advice: Buy all your gifts through mail order catalogues and have those  guys wrap and deliver them. Then, with a newfound sense of relief, crawl onto  one of the 10 stools that compose Gianni's cushy bar. Order a Cappuccino  Americana, a frothy mix of coffee, Kahlua, brandy and Grand Marnier, and watch  the holiday hustle bustle by.  </P> <P>  Gianni, 3333 Bear St., Costa Mesa. The bar is open 10 a.m to 10 p.m. Monday  through Saturday and 11 a.m to 7 p.m. Sunday. (714) 540-3365. JANET EASTMAN  </P></p>

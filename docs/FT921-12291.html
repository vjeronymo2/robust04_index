			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy It is a measure of the depths being plumbed by the UK economy that rising imports are now greeted by some as evidence of a consumer revival rather than a threat to the balance of payments. In last year's fourth quarter, import volume, excluding oil and erratics, was up only one per cent on the year before. But there seems little doubt that after the late summer, the upward trend is now re-established. It thus seems likely that the current account deficit, which narrowed last year from Pounds 15.2bn to Pounds 5.8bn, will this year widen again. The persistence of the deficit throughout the most prolonged recession since the war is dispiriting evidence of the UK economy's structural failings. It will also limit the recovery, whenever it arrives. The problem need not be one of financing the deficit. It is rather that memories of the Lawson boom are still too fresh for any government to preside over a collapse in the balance of payments with equanimity. If a rising deficit had to be suppressed, the UK could yet again find itself out of step with Germany. Suppose that sterling were in narrow bands and that German interest rates had been cut to stimulate the German economy. Sterling could then be near enough to its ERM ceiling to make raising rates as difficult as cutting them is now. If that seems far-fetched, it is worth recalling that as recently as 1987, Mr Lawson's attempts to cap sterling at DM3 involved slashing base rates even as the current account was plunging. If base rate rises were ruled out, the obvious alternative would be to raise taxes. In that case, the market might ask itself what advantage there is in the Tories winning the election.</p>

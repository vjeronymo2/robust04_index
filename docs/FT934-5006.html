			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Aid budget to rise Pounds 83m - Help for developing counties up 4% Britain's total external assistance programmes are to be maintained at their previously agreed levels. The aid budget, covering aid to developing countries and assistance to central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, is set to rise by Pounds 83m by 1996/97 - or 4 per cent in cash terms - compared with the 1993/94 provision. Aid for the poorest countries in Africa and Asia and the provision of know-how to central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union remain particular priorities for ODA assistance. In all countries we pay close attention to good government and the pursuit of economic reform. Increased provision is made for global environment assistance, rising to Pounds 24m by 1996/97, to provide for Britain's share of the replenishment of the Global Environment Facility and of the Montreal Protocol funding mechanism.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Shenzhen, January 27 (XINHUA) -- Shenzhen, a  special economic zone in Guangdong Province, set a new record in  its economic growth rate in 1993, the city government announced  today.    The city's gross domestic product (GDP) -- the value of  goods  and services produced -- amounted to 41.35 billion yuan last  year, up 30 percent over 1992 and 17 percentage points higher  than the nation's average, a city government official said.    The official said that per-capita GDP in Shenzhen was 15,000  yuan, up 33.5 percent and six times the nation's average.    Special and flexible policies are being pursued in Shenzhen  to attract investors from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and overseas.    Shenzhen's industrial output value shot up nearly 35 percent  in 1993 to 48 billion yuan, the official said.    The growth of collectively-owned manufacturers is the most  impressive, he said. These manufacturers scored a near 90  percent rise in total output value last year, much higher than  both state- owned and foreign-funded manufacturers.    Meanwhile, economic returns of manufacturers of various  types  have improved markedly, he said.    For example, the comprehensive economic returns index for  local manufacturers stood at 129.7 during the first 11 months of  1993, up 28.16 points.    The official said that Shenzhen achieved a substantial  increase in investment in fixed assets in 1993 -- estimated at  19.5 billion yuan, a 38 percent increase over 1992.    Shenzhen spent a quarter of the investment building roads,  bridges, a power plant and a waterworks, he said.    Expanded production and higher economic returns have enabled  Shenzhen residents to enjoy higher living standards, he said.    The earnings of local residents averaged 589 yuan per person  in 1993, up 9.3 percent in real terms, he said.    Moreover, the local market is brisk, with retail sales  totalling 16 billion yuan last year, a rise of nearly 39  percent, he said.    Shenzhen's revenue soared by almost 57 percent to 6.73  billion yuan in 1993, he said.    Furthermore, the local financial order has turned for the  better, the local foreign exchange swap market has been stable  and money has been in ample supply, he said.    At the end of December, savings deposits in local banks  totalled 65.74 billion yuan and loans extended amounted to 50  billion yuan, he said.</p>

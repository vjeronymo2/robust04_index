			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / International Company News: Wolters Kluwer net advances 24% WOLTERS Kluwer, the Dutch publisher, said net profit rose 24 per cent to Fl 214m (Dollars 114m) in 1991. It forecast increases in profit and turnover for 1992. The company, one of the Netherlands' Big Three publishers, said yesterday it would raise its 1991 dividend to Fl 1.16 a share from Fl 1.00 in 1990. Operating profit in 1991 increased by nearly 30 per cent to Fl 362m, on turnover up 17 per cent at Fl 2.38bn. The company said two core business activities in particular - legal and medical publishing  - saw the biggest gains in operating results. Wolters Kluwer, which is also active in business, scientific and educational publishing, operates mainly in Europe and the US. The 1991 results include Fl 6m in after-tax extraordinary charges for reorganisations being carried out in the UK and the Netherlands. In 1990, Wolters Kluwer incurred net extraordinary charges of Fl 3m. Wolters Kluwer repeated its previous medium-range forecast that turnover would reach Fl 2.7bn in 1994, and that it would see at least 17 per cent annual growth in fully-diluted profit per share between now and then. In 1991, net profit per share rose by 17 per cent to Fl 3.46.</p>

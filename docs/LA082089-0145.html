			<p><P> August 20, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> TORRANCE CONSIDERS STRICTER LIMITS ON THE SIZE OF HOUSES  </P> <P> After months of public hearings, the Torrance City Council on Tuesday will  consider a new set of building standards to limit the size of single-family  houses in the city.  </P> <P> The proposed standards are similar to, but somewhat stricter than, temporary  controls adopted by the council in May. The proposal would limit the floor area  of a house relative to lot size, set a new height limit for single-story  houses, establish new side and rear setback requirements, and limit the  percentage of the lot that a house can occupy.  </P> <P> The search for new standards was prompted by complaints from dozens of  residents who said oversized single-family houses being built throughout the  city are increasing density and traffic and encroaching on neighbors' privacy,  views and sunlight.  </P> <P> Although many residents have applauded the city for considering stricter  standards, several builders said the proposed limits are too restrictive and  will hurt their businesses.  </P> <P> Torrance has about 32,000 single-family homes on lots totaling 4,043 acres.  About 38% of the city is zoned for single-family houses.  </P> <P> Sam Burrescia, a builder in Torrance since 1971 who has attended some of the  hearings, said the proposed standards are too restrictive and would force  developers and builders to take their business elsewhere.  </P> <P> As did several other builders, he said he thinks the city is acting in haste to  implement arbitrary limits.  </P> <P> "The restrictions are being created more by emotion than a professional  approach," he said.  </P> <P> Some homeowners, such as Mary Papavasiliou, a 20-year resident of Torrance and  a member of the Seaside Homeowners Assn., say the building standards are needed  to ensure that single-family houses in Torrance do not have a negative effect  on adjacent neighbors.  </P> <P> She said that she understands the concerns expressed by builders but that the  city needs to address the problem of oversized single-family houses.  </P> <P> "I see their side," she said. "But I don't want the city to look the way  (builders) want it to look."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Won't Affect Existing Homes  </P> <P> The recommended standards will not affect existing homes but will have an  impact on new houses, additions and houses that are remodeled. If the standards  are adopted, the City Council will decide Tuesday whether to exempt all  construction plans for single-family houses that are currently being reviewed  by the Planning Department.  </P> <P> In order to control the size of two-story houses, the recommendations would  limit the floor area to 60% of the lot area. The proposal includes garages as  part of the floor area but excludes basements.  </P> <P> The average single-family lot in the city is between 5,000 and 6,000 square  feet, city officials said. Under the proposed limit, a house on a lot of 5,000  square feet can have no more than 3,000 square feet of floor area. A house on a  6,000-square-foot lot can have no more than 3,600 square feet of floor area.  </P> <P> The proposal would allow a floor area of up to 70% of the lot area if the  side-yard setback is increased. A minimum side-yard setback of 10% of the lot  width, or at least three feet, is required under current restrictions and would  remain the same under the proposed standards.  </P> <P> To exceed the proposed limit, a builder must increase the minimum side-yard  setbacks to 20% of the lot width for the second story or 15% for both the first  and second stories.  </P> <P> In addition, houses exceeding the limit must also conform to a new "bulk  control" measure. It requires that no portion of the house protrude outside an  invisible "tent" that rises vertically 21 feet at the minimum side-yard setback  and extends at a 45-degree angle toward the interior of the site.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Size Control Measure  </P> <P> The concept has been used as a size control measure in Palo Alto and Santa  Monica, according to Principal Planner Patricia Bluman.  </P> <P> The proposal also establishes new requirements for back-yard setbacks: an  average of 15 feet, with a minimum of 10 feet, for single-story houses, and an  average of 20 feet or a minimum of 15 feet for second-story additions. The  back-yard setbacks for two-story houses would remain at the current average of  20 feet or minimum of 15 feet.  </P> <P> Front-yard setbacks will remain the same as now required: an average of 20  feet, with a minimum of 15 feet for both one- and two-story houses.  </P> <P> Under current regulations, the height of all single-family houses is limited to  27 feet. The new standards would set limits of 18 feet for one-story houses and  27 feet for two-story houses.  </P> <P> The standards would also require that the base of a new two-story house cover  no more than 40% of the lot. The current limit for lot coverage is 50%. Under  the proposed standards, the lot coverage limit of 50% for one-story houses and  second-story additions would remain the same.  </P> <P> Bluman said the 40% lot coverage requirement would ensure that more open space  is provided around the house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Detached Structures Prohibited  </P> <P> The proposed standards would also prohibit single-family detached guest houses,  outdoor staircases and detached, two-story accessory buildings.  </P> <P> In May, the City Council approved an emergency ordinance limiting new  single-family homes to a floor area of no more than 60% of the lot area. The  ordinance also applies to additions or modifications. Up to 400 square feet of  the garage area can be excluded from the floor area.  </P> <P> That ordinance was adopted as a temporary limit until the city enacts permanent  standards.  </P> <P> Burrescia said that the emergency limits were fair and that he would not oppose  the new standards if the floor area limit also excluded 400 square feet for the  garage. He said that without the extra garage area, builders will make smaller  garages, forcing owners of new single-family houses to park in the streets.  </P> <P> Bluman, who has been instrumental in developing the proposed standards, said  the limits are reasonable and are intended to satisfy the concerns of residents  and builders.  </P> <P> She said that developing the standards was "difficult because we were trying to  balance the concerns of everyone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Developed Over Six Months  </P> <P> The recommended standards have been developed over the last six months and  discussed at six public hearings where city planning officials heard testimony  from residents, developers and real estate brokers.  </P> <P> City planning officials said they also studied the building limits imposed in  cities throughout Los Angeles County.  </P> <P> Although builders say the proposed standards will hurt their businesses, Bluman  said that the market for new single-family houses in Torrance is strong and  that "it would surprise me if it truly turned away the developers."  </P> <P> Tom May, a builder in Torrance for 2 1/2 years, disagrees. He said the proposed  limits have made him contemplate moving his business.  </P> <P> "Next year is really up in the air," he said.  </P> <P> Echoing the sentiments of several builders, May said that new-home buyers are  requesting large two-story houses with two-car garages and that the proposed  limits would make building such houses difficult.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Sad Situation'  </P> <P> "It's a sad situation," said Judy Trombertta, who owns Judy T Escrow Co. in  Torrance.  </P> <P> She said the limits could ultimately hurt homeowners who will someday want to  sell their single-family houses. Homeowners may find that builders, developers  and real estate brokers will be reluctant to buy older, smaller houses because  the proposed standards would prevent tearing them down to build larger houses,  Trombertta said.  </P> <P> Despite those concerns, Bob Billett, president of the Southwood Homeowners  Assn., said he believes the market for single-family houses in Torrance will  continue to be strong.  </P> <P> Billett, who has also expressed his views at some of the hearings, supports the  proposed standards, saying, "I think the city is certainly going in the right  direction."  </P> <P> </P> <P> PROPOSED CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES FOR SINGLE-FAMILY HOMES  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council this week will consider new construction guidelines  for single-family houses. Drawings show setbacks and height limits set by  guidelines. Maximum lot coverage for the one-story home and a home with a  second-story addition is 50%,  </P> <P> or 2,500 square feet for lot size shown. Maximum lot coverage for a new  two-story home or one with significant remodeling would be 40%, or 2,000 square  feet for the lot illustrated.  </P></p>

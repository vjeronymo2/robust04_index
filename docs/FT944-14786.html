			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / Management: Putting re-engineering in perspective A large European multinational company recently launched a root-and-branch redesign of its two most important operating processes: the way its units in a dozen countries develop new products together; and its 'order to delivery' cycle. The latter covers the processing of customer orders through the company's sales organisation to its many factories across Europe, and the delivery of products back to the market. The primary goal of both projects is for the company to become more responsive to customer demands, cutting time and costs sharply. Both projects are examples of real 'business process re-engineering': rather than merely improving existing processes, they involve a fundamental redesign. But the company has not attached a 're-engineering' label to either of them. This is not because it shares the now widespread fear that any re-engineering exercise worthy of the name will provoke resistance among many of the managers involved. Nor is it because of an associated problem: that re-engineering has been so hyped and misunderstood over the past 18 months that it is getting a bad name among many top managements for failing to deliver anything like the promised results. Instead, the company is avoiding the term for a deeper reason: that it knows the re-engineering of such processes is only one part of a jigsaw of tricky, interlocking changes that must be made if it is to achieve its newly formulated 'vision' of delighting customers, rather than just satisfying them, and of becoming the best company in its industry, rather than just a competent leading player. It sees four sets of parallel changes as all-important to this transformation: first, breaking down barriers between its different disciplinary specialists and national units by a series of procedural and structural steps, of which the re-engineering of cross-unit processes is only one; second, developing an explicit set of values and behaviour guidelines which are subscribed to (or 'shared') by everyone in the organisation; third, redefining the role of management in order to foster much more empowerment, responsibility and decisiveness at every level. All this requires the creation of the fourth factor: an unprecedented degree of openness and trust among managers. The company's approach is in line with the conclusions of an independent study of 100 European companies just delivered to the Brussels Commission*. It reports that - so far, at least - most companies that introduce new ways of working do not use re-engineering - at least by name. The study blames this on the fact that re-engineering has become far too associated in managers' minds with narrow targets such as headcount reductions and cost-cutting. On the face of it, the company's comprehensive approach would seem to differ fundamentally from the 're-engineering' doctrine promulgated by consultants such as Michael Hammer and James Champy, who together launched the fashion early last year. Writing on this page a fortnight ago (Oct 5), Hammer suggested that all these other facets of change, though vital to a company, are subordinate to the re-engineering of its business processes. On the same day, Champy was on a public platform propounding a slightly different message, but one that also sees re-engineering as the umbrella for all these other changes. He argued that the re-engineering revolution would never be more than half-successful until management itself was re-engineered; that is, until the attitude of managers at every level of the organisation, and the nature of their work, shifted from the traditional model of constant 'command and control' to one of setting the broad direction, and then mobilising and enabling others to manage themselves to a very considerable extent. Through the defining of goals and the measurement of performance, this still involves a strong degree of influence, but of a very different nature from before. Champy attributes the 'under-achievement' - or failure - of many re-engineering projects to this managerial block. (Like Hammer, he disputes the much-reported 'failure rate' of 70 per cent; he prefers to say that 30-40 per cent disappoint.) In common with the myriad organisational specialists in consultancy and academia who have spent many more years than he or Hammer trying to help managers break through this block, he recognises how hard it is for executives - especially senior ones - to make the leap, especially when they fear for their own jobs. Ideally, it should make no difference - except to rival consultancies - whether the change jigsaw is given the umbrella term of 're-engineering', or something more generic, such as 'organisational change' or 'transformation'. What really matters is managerial recognition that all the different pieces form a challenging and interlocking system that cannot be altered - except chaotically - just by altering one of them. But most managers try to do precisely that, since they are not used to thinking in systems terms. Over the past few years they have grasped desperately at one piece of the jigsaw after another in isolation, from culture change to process re-engineering. By doing so they confound their purpose, and compromise the readiness of their organisations to confront the real complexities of change. That is why easily misunderstood metaphors such as re-engineering are so attractive yet so dangerous. It is not surprising that wary companies avoid them like the plague. * Cobra report.

			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Milk market reform plan put on shelf Plans to open the milk market in England and Wales to competition on April 1 were shelved yesterday. The Milk Marketing Board failed to overcome remaining government objections to its proposals to become a producer co-operative. Postponement of the board's demise was agreed at a meeting between Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive, and government officials. 'Because of the lead time that we need to make all the necessary arrangements, we're not going to hit April 1,' said Mr Peter Morgan, the board's head of corporate affairs. Time is needed in particular for the partial flotation of Dairy Crest, the board's dairy products subsidiary, which has to take place first in order to provide working capital for the new co-operative, Milk Marque. The board, which for 60 years has bought all milk from farmers in England and Wales, selling it on to dairy companies, must now propose a new date for market liberalisation. It is believed to favour July 1. 'We won't want to delay any longer than is necessary, but neither will we want to rush into putting forward another date if there's a risk we can't honour it,' said Mr Morgan. The government last month challenged key aspects of the board's plans, saying they could be anti-competitive. Questions were raised over the proposed bulk transfer of assets, milk records and haulage contracts from the board to the new body, the way milk would be auctioned to dairy companies and the requirement that farmers who joined Milk Marque should give 12 months' notice if they wanted to leave. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, moved quickly yesterday to dispel concern among farmers about the uncertainty that has been created over the future of milk marketing. 'We have made such good progress on outstanding issues that I'm confident we shall come to a good agreement,' she said. 'However, the issues raised are very complex ones affecting 30,000 milk producers, 50m consumers and an industry valued in billions of pounds. 'The most important thing is to ensure the successor arrangements for the Milk Marketing Board are right.' A further meeting will be held on January 24, when both sides hope remaining problems can be resolved.</p>

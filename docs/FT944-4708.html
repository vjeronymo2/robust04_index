			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Siebe Siebe has been promising organic growth for some time. Yesterday it produced some. The controls group has yet to reach its target of increasing sales from existing operations by 10 per cent. But organic growth in the half year to end-September was 7.2 per cent and orders were up 13.4 per cent - meaning Siebe should achieve its goal for the second half. Operating margins were slightly up despite low margins at some recently acquired companies. In time, these should rise towards Siebe's 14 per cent average. The strength of Siebe's business is shown by its return on net assets which has moved over 26 per cent. The group benefits from operating in markets which are growing fairly quickly but which are protected by high barriers to entry. Siebe's high levels of research and capital spending should enable it to increase its market share steadily without suffering an erosion of margins. With annual cash flow of about Pounds 100m and gearing at the half year down to 19 per cent, Siebe is well-placed to keep up a steady flow of infill acquisitions. So far, it has shown itself adept at integrating new purchases. If Siebe also confirms in coming months its capacity to grow organically, its shares will deserve more than the slight market premium on which they now trade.</p>

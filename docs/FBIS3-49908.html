			<p>Language: <F P=105> Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] A short while ago our reporter  Yveta Benikova telephoned us to say that a vote of confidence in  Ludovit Cernak, chairman of the Slovak National Party [SNS] has  just been taken. Out of 52 delegates, 13 cast a vote of  confidence, eight delegates abstained, and 22 delegates cast a  vote of no confidence. On the basis of that vote the Central  Council called on Ludovit Cernak to resign his post. A vote on  whether to recall the party's deputy chairmen and the central  secretary from their posts is being held at the moment.</p>

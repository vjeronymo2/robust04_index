			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (16): Investment pays dividends, say users - Britain leads the way in Europe in applying electronic data interchange services, although it is still early days for the concept.  Now EDI suppliers are seeking to attract thousands of small company users / Suppliers THE SUPPLIERS of electronic data interchange (EDI) services are far from satisfied with UK market growth which the research company Input says is running at over 25 per cent a year, writes John Kavanagh. Market leader INS has already slashed its prices this year, following price changes by competitors in 1992. Newcomer British Telecom still negotiates each contract individually and is 'doing some good deals,' according to users. It expects to publish a standard price list this spring. 'EDI penetration in the UK is still only five per cent,' says Mr Neil Lawrence, EDI commercial manager at BT. 'Only 300 of the Times top 1,000 use it, although there is a lot of interest during the recession, because it cuts costs. 'We expect the number of top 1,000 companies using EDI to double in the next two or three years - and each big company brings in another 2,000 or more of its suppliers.' INS is going directly for those smaller companies with its price cuts. 'We signed more than 1,100 companies last year, almost a quarter of our total, but there is more serious competition now and we want to stimulate growth still further,' says INS managing director Mr Lee Tate. 'Big growth will only continue if we attract the thousands and thousands of small companies.' INS, jointly owned by ICL and international EDI service company GEIS, was set up in 1985 to launch the Tradanet service, defined by the Article Number Association, for retailers and their suppliers. It claims to have 55 per cent of the UK market from this and other EDI communities. Around 6m documents pass through its network each month. INS' traditional rival has been AT&amp;T-Istel. Then come IBM, GEIS and, since October 1991, BT. In Europe as a whole, research analysts at IDC estimate INS and GEIS equal with 33 per cent, IBM with 13 per cent and AT&amp;T with nine per cent. There are links between the services: an early complaint about INS and AT&amp;T-Istel was that users had to connect to both networks to trade electronically with all their customers. However, this was no longer an issue for companies interviewed by Software At Work. Even smaller companies trading with customers on different networks preferred to have separate connections to each network. 'Interconnectivity is a lot more than just communications links,' says Mr David Elliott, EDI manager at British Gas. 'When you link to one service, you have a complete audit trail: you know your message arrived and when someone looked at it. I'd rather pay for the link direct to the separate services than use the bridges between them.' Several users made similar comments, pointing to possible problems of sorting out legal responsibility if a message got lost. As well as network providers, the EDI market also includes companies providing software for linking to the various networks and converting data into and out of the correct message formats. Input says network services currently account for just over 60 per cent of the European market, software for 16 per cent and consultancy for 23 per cent. It expects network services to grow to 72 per cent by 1997, at the expense of consultancy. Charging structures vary from one network supplier to the next. There is generally a one-off joining fee of Pounds 200-Pounds 250 for a personal computer link. After that, comparisons are difficult: software for handling links to one or more services can cost up to Pounds 2,750 for a personal computer or between Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 55,000 for a mainframe, depending on the facilities required. Some suppliers make a monthly charge (INS' is Pounds 50) which includes free receipt of any amount of data and a small charge for sending it; others have no monthly fee but charge for both sending and receiving. This means charges per 1,000 characters can range from 2.5p to 10p. After all the complicated pricing formulae have been compared, personal computer users will find EDI will probably cost them a few hundred pounds a year. Mainframe users will pay considerably more: IBM says Pounds 10,000 is a typical running cost for the first year alone, when a company is likely to have only a few EDI partners. However, all users, of varying sizes and usage, contacted by Software At Work felt their initial investment and running costs were paying dividends.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow Russian Television Network in  Russian at 1525 GMT on 14 June 1994 broadcasts a 30-minute  program entitled "Debates" chaired by correspondent A.N.  Kuryakov with N.T. Ryabov, chairman of the Central Electoral  Commission, and Doctor of Law Yu.A. Vedeneyev of the Institute  of State and Law, in which they discussed the articles that have  appeared in the press recently questioning the validity of the  12 December referendum on the Constitution of the Russian  Federation.    Referring to the allegations, Ryabov starts by noting: "The  newspaper IZVESTIYA has called them political dynamite but I  would call them political soap because dynamite and soap are  rather similar in external appearance but are quite different in  their effect. Also, these press articles leave behind only soap  bubbles. So, we have not paid any particular attention to these  analysts and their deductions."    One of the main areas of criticism has been about alleged  discrepancies in the total numbers of votes cast, "but these  authors have either forgotten or have deliberately omitted the  other five parties that took part in the elections. They did  not surmount the five percent barrier, but some people did vote  for them; they accounted together for 4.7 million votes. So if  one compares the number of votes cast in favor of the  Constitution with the number of votes cast for the party lists,  one can see that the Constitution was passed."    Ryabov goes on to examine various details of the allegations  and produced documentary evidence to show that they were untrue.  He concludes: "There is not a single documented fact that  proves these falsifications, and certainly none showing massive  falsifications, which these few authors write about so  ecstatically."    Legal expert Vedeneyev points out that the Supreme Court has  issued a decision confirming the validity of the referendum.  Ryabov recalls that on 16 March 1994 the Supreme Court had  rejected the Russian Communist Workers' Party appeal for the  referendum to be deemed invalid. International observers had  also approved the validity of the voting, he says.    Vedeneyev says that the political forces which did not like  the election results were trying to cast doubt on them. "There  is also an attempt to instill uncertainty and dissatisfaction in  the public consciousness and once again to initiate the  atmosphere of crisis, which was characteristic of 1993." Ryabov  agrees and goes on: "This sort of article is coming from  representatives of certain political forces that are either  outside the legitimate political system such as the Russian  Communist Workers' Party or else are formally within the real  political system, but because of the forms and methods of  struggle they use cannot be fully part of this system."    Ryabov suggests that these allegations had been raised now  in  response to the draft law guaranteeing electoral rights, which  has been submitted by the president to the Federal Assembly.    Ryabov concludes by recalling that all legal suits against  the validity of the referendum had been rejected and the authors  of the recent allegations "for some reason are not in a hurry to  apply to the courts."</p>

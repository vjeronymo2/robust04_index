			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Round-table studio discussion on the program ``Nonnuclear </F> Ukraine'' including Ivan Oliynyk, the Ukrainian deputy defense  minister for armaments issues and a scientist; the general  manager of the Kharkiv Physical Institute; chief of the  Strategic Troops Administration at the Ukrainian Defense  Ministry; the commander of the 43rd Rocket Army; and the deputy  chief of the department for scientific issues at the Ukrainian  Defense Ministry]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted]    Unidentified announcer: Since there are certain  complications ahead, I think it is too early to speak about the  transportation of Ukrainian nuclear ammunition to Russia as an  accomplished fact. Could you please tell us how long it may  take to implement this process? It is not going to happen  overnight, is it?    Unidentified speaker in Russian: I completely  agree with you that this process will not be completed in one  year. This is a lengthy process that will depend on technical  conditions and safe transportation capabilities. To this end,  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry is putting together timetables  and plans to precisely observe each provision and rule out any  off-chance accident. We cannot be even an iota wrong. This is  why meeting all safety requirements for transportation will call  for a considerable amount of time and effort on the part of the  Defense Ministry officials and military officers who are experts  on this issue.    In addition, the transportation and preparation for it will  involve Russian specialists who developed and utilized this  nuclear ammunition. Everyone is asking today: When will the  first and the last [warhead] be removed? The defense minister  has made it perfectly clear: The state has to have state  secrets. Today, making public when a nuclear load will be  transported through the Ukrainian territory -- which is a  distance of from 721 km to 1223 km to our eastern border... This  is a long distance. And we must secure safe conditions for this  transportation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Notes and Information" page: "Incomplete Agenda"] </F>   [Text] The article in which Foreign Minister Celso Amorim  outlined some features of Brazilian foreign policy, which O  ESTADO published on 10 April, is important both because of what  it says and because of what it does not say. It is such an  exaggerated expression of support for multilateral action that  to less alert readers it can give the impression that foreign  policy and international law are exact synonyms, and that the  only solution for any country, especially Brazil, can be found  in international organizations. Minister Celso Amorim, who  completed the brightest part of his career in multilateral  discussions before becoming foreign minister, is aware however  that a consistent foreign policy cannot do without the rude  power balance contingencies stemming from bilateral relations.  In his article, Amorim has precisely failed to describe the  objectives and strategies orienting external action to countries  like the United States, which are so relevant for Brazil.    It should be noted that since Celso Amorim has headed  Itamaraty, Brazil has been relieved of part of the burden of its  conflicts with industrialized countries. Next to Amorim's  article, we published on 10 April an article by our Washington  correspondent reporting a change in the attitude toward Brazil  from some of the most influential U.S. policy makers [two  preceding words in English]. They are people who were removed  from their universe of reflection that fed on negative, mistaken  perceptions of Brazil, perceptions that concealed the efforts  Brazil has made over the past three years to modernize itself  and to adapt itself to the new situation in international  commerce. Part of this change in perception was caused by the  weight of facts. But part of it also was caused by a systematic  effort by Itamaraty to show in the big capitals of the world  that the dynamics of Brazilian society and the Brazilian economy  are leading the country along the path followed by  industrialized nations. There are, of course, differences in  speed and rate, but not of the goal.    It should be noticed, however, that the assistant secretary  of state for Latin American affairs and the under secretary of  commerce for international affairs [titles as published] -- as  well as other people in the U.S. Government or outside it -- did  not realize the changes that occurred in Brazil thanks to the  country's presence at multilateral forums. An essential factor  for them to realize that something positive was happening here  was the resolution and settlement of matters dealing with  bilateral conflicts that, because of today's interdependence,  have affected relations between Brazil and other countries that  share some of the principles upheld by the United States. In  this way, the tension in Brazilian-U.S. relations dropped  considerably after the Brazilian Congress approved the  quadripartite nuclear safeguard agreement, an action that also  permitted our relations with Germany to reach -- or return to --  a higher level. Likewise, the annoying question of the foreign  debt was not blessed by the multilateral IMF; instead, the  agreement with creditor banks moved forward thanks to the U.S.  Treasury's support.    Brazil has good reasons to seek the protection of  international organizations. A big country, yet unwilling to  project its own power far beyond its borders, those in charge of  Brazilian diplomacy prefer the legal protection granted by  multilateral forums. This formula yielded results for some time,  and it is still yielding good results in specific conditions.  The problem is that Brazilian interests are becoming excessively  complex to be handled exclusively with the consensus method of  international bodies. For a country demanding rapid and original  solutions, such organizations can delay the answers too long,  and, since their answers are based on consensus, they will not  fully take national interests into account. From this viewpoint,  multilateral organizations entail "compulsory support," with  which it is better to do away. Therefore, many multilateral  organizations administer justice in business and politics  because those organizations will always give mankind a basis for  moving toward utopia. But many efforts also concentrate on the  fast resolution of problems that affect our everyday life and  that can be resolved only through direct dialogue between two  sides.    Itamaraty has properly given priority to the new action  aiming at promoting economic and political cooperation and  integration in South America. New actions should preferably  concentrate on our neighboring areas. It is important, however,  that the search for new courses not erase old trails. Brazil's  future will certainly depend on South American integration. But  it is also true that the present is the platform of the future,  and the present is linked to the United States and other  industrialized nations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Munich PRO 7 Television Network in  German at 2130 GMT on 18 January in its "Reporter" program  carries a seven-minute report by Rainer Laux on Russian Liberal  Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. During the  segment, Zhirinovskiy reacts to German media reports about him,  including a report on his alleged contacts with a prostitute in  Vienna published by the German daily Hamburg BILD.    Laux opens the report by saying that he showed Zhirinovskiy  recent copies of German newspapers and "confronted him with our  fear of a return to the Cold War." When he was shown a copy of  DER SPIEGEL depicting his face in the foreground and Hitler's in  the background, Zhirinovskiy's said: "It is very nice to see my  picture on the front cover of DER SPIEGEL. However, if I am  depicted once more along with Hitler, and if you compare me with  Hitler again, then the future for DER SPIEGEL will be tough, and  then I could see the end of DER SPIEGEL before long. Our party  has never had a relationship with your underexposed [referring  to the cover photo] fuehrer. You must never forget that your  mad Hitler shot and annihilated more than 26 million Russian  citizens. You and your fuehrer, who was nothing but an  uneducated painter. He was a mad fanatic who was later  condemned by the entire world. Pass that immediately on to our  lawyers. We will sue DER SPIEGEL for 100 million marks."    The journalist stresses that Zhirinovskiy's strong language  appeals to people and that he always knows how to place himself  at the center of attention. Laux notes that although  Zhirinovskiy's popularity is increasing, he is "far from  supported by all Russians." One unidentified man in the street  states that Zhirinovskiy is "a dangerous man, who might start  World War III." A woman who is asked about Zhirinovskiy only  says that "he is mad."    Laux then describes Zhirinovskiy's rhetorical talent: "He  terrifies his audience with spraying spittle, he evokes the huge  disappearing empire, reaching his climax by showering abuse on  the corrupt reformers, communist liars, and obtrusive  foreigners."    Rainer Laux then notes that these slogans are "particularly  appealing to the young Nazis in Russia," who are still meeting  "secretly," while "their great idol" appeared at a Congress of  the German People's Union [DVU] in Passau last October. Laux  adds that the DVU has "booked" Zhirinovskiy again for its  "right-wing radical spectacle" this coming September.    However, Laux argues that Zhirinovskiy "is flexible, and  cultivates profitable contacts with the left, too. The millions  of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED] are welcome."  Quoting from a German newspaper, Zhirinovskiy says: "My dear  deputies. Here I can read that the communists in eastern Germany  -- the SED, although they call themselves differently now -- say  that they paid us DM8 million. Please tell them that we would  be happy if only they had given us DM8. All the money for us,  immediately."    Laux emphasizes that the military, in particular, feel  attracted by "the dangerous dreams of a megalomaniac demagogue."  Zhirinovskiy: "Germany is not an independent country, because  it is occupied. More than 300,000 Russian soldiers remain  stationed in Germany. As the security power, Russia can  determine your country's fate. We have the right to say whether  the soldiers remain there or are withdrawn. Instead of  withdrawing them we might as well send another 700,000 soldiers  there. Then 1 million Russian soldiers would stand on German  soil."    Zhirinovskiy then goes on to say: "BILD claims I had sex  with a girl. Am I not allowed to do that? What do the Germans  think? Don't the Germans have contact with women, or do they do  it with animals? What do the Germans do? What is the problem?  That one here? I have to put on my glasses. This girl is a  snake. I do not want one like her. Let me meet 10 other girls.  Sasha, look, they say that I did it with that girl in Austria.  It would have been a pleasure for me to have had something with  20 Austrians, but not with that one. You can dump that one off  on Schmidt and Kohl, but not on me."    Laux says that apart from his threats to occupy Germany,  Zhirinovskiy also "hypocritically expressed his sarcastic  concern about our country."    Zhirinovskiy: "One day Germany will cease to exist, because  more and more people are getting divorced there, people do not  have children any more, everybody is gay. This is why Germany  will soon be populated only by foreigners! Do you understand  that?"    Laux ends the report with a quote from Zhirinovskiy's  address  to the DVU Congress in Passau last October. Zhirinovskiy:  "Long live the great Germany, long live the great Russia.  Russian and Germans -- friends forever."</p>

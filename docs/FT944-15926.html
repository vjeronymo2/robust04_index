			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Yields stay high - Pibs Following the successful merger of the Northern Rock building society, the UK's 11th largest, and the North of England, its smaller neighbour, Pibs (permanent interest-bearing shares) issued by North of England are now in Northern Rock's name, writes Scheherazade Daneshkhu. The table shows that gross yields at present are between 10.36 and 11.81 per cent - higher than a year ago when they stood at 8.62 to 10.22 per cent. Peter Capel, director of Hoare Govett Corporate Finance, says: 'Sentiment in the gilt market has improved markedly since the start of the new quarter. Indeed, this week's retail price inflation data is reducing investors' worst interest-rate expectations. 'Investment flows have been increasing as investors move to lock-in the excellent real returns now offered by sterling bond markets. Fixed-rate Pibs have not as yet felt the full benefit of this change in sentiment, and currently offer an improved buying opportunity when compared with gilts.' But the yields on Pibs are also an indication of the higher risk of buying paper issued by a building society compared with that from the government. Pibs have no maturity date, so the investor's capital cannot be guaranteed. The only way to get capital back is to sell the Pibs into the open market. Interest is paid net of basic-rate tax and gains are exempt from capital gains tax unless the Pibs are held within a unit trust. In theory, they pay a fixed rate of interest indefinitely, but missed interest payments do not mount up for payment at a later date. Those holding Pibs are last in line for repayment in the event of a wind-up, and are not covered by a compensation scheme.  --------------------------------------------------------- PERMANENT INTEREST-BEARING SHARES  --------------------------------------------------------- Stock                      Coupon     Minimum   Issue date                         (gross, %)    (Pounds)  --------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires         9.38       1,000     16/12/93 Bradford &amp; Bingley          13.00      10,000      30/9/91 Bradford &amp; Bingley          11.63      10,000      29/6/92 Bristol &amp; West              13.38       1,000     11/12/91 Bristol &amp; West              13.38       1,000     31/10/91 Britannia (1st)             13.00       1,000      13/1/92 Britannia (2nd)             13.00       1,000      8/10/92 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs         11.75      50,000     21/10/92 Coventry                    12.13       1,000      28/5/92 First National              11.75      10,000       4/5/93 Halifax                     12.00      50,000      23/1/92 Halifax                      8.75      50,000       7/9/93 Leeds Permanent             13.63      50,000       3/6/91 Leeds &amp; Holbeck             13.38       1,000      31/3/92 Newcastle                   12.63       1,000       8/9/92 Newcastle                   10.75       1,000      15/6/93 Northern Rock               12.63       1,000      23/6/92 Skipton                     12.88       1,000      27/2/92  --------------------------------------------------------- Stock                 Issue price       Price*      Yield*                            (pence)     (pence)  (gross, %)  --------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires       100.17       86.75        10.87 Bradford &amp; Bingley         100.20      122.25        10.70 Bradford &amp; Bingley         100.13      111.00        10.54 Bristol &amp; West             101.79      123.50        10.90 Bristol &amp; West             100.34      123.50        10.90 Britannia (1st)            100.42      120.00        10.90 Britannia (2nd)            107.13      120.00        10.90 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs        100.96      113.25        10.44 Coventry                   100.75      112.50        10.84 First National             100.25      100.25        11.81 Halifax                    100.28      115.00        10.50 Halifax                    100.62       85.00        10.36 Leeds Permanent            100.00      129.00        10.62 Leeds &amp; Holbeck            100.23      122.25        11.01 Newcastle                   12.63      115.50        11.00 Newcastle                  100.32       98.13        11.00 Northern Rock              100.14      116.75        10.88 Skipton                    100.48      117.75        11.00  --------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett.  --------------------------------------------------------- *Purchase price as at opening October 13; excludes accrued interest  ---------------------------------------------------------</p>

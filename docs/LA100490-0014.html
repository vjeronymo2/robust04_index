			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> IGHNER TAKES THE SLOW LANE  </P> <P> Benard Ighner, one of the most misspelled names on the vocal scene, is also one  of the most misguided singers ever to waste a splendid talent. The evidence was  clear Tuesday at the Vine St. Bar &amp; Grill.  </P> <P> Opening with the Miles Davis waltz "All Blues" -- hardly a blockbuster, but a  fair-enough vehicle for his deep, resonant baritone -- he slowed things further  with "The Look of Love," using a somewhat stiff trio backing, then hit pop  bottom with "People." How can a composer capable of writing "Everything Must  Change" waste himself on these banal lyrics at this dreary tempo?  </P> <P> After his own "Little Dreamer," which at least had a beat of sorts, he slowed  it down yet again for an almost soporific "Dindi," then accompanied himself at  the piano for "Everything Must Change."  </P> <P> Ighner then brought on his sister Sandra, a most attractive woman with a warm,  appealing voice, but did she change the tempo, or offer one of her brother's  songs? Au contraire -- she offered those brand-new items "My Funny Valentine"  and, on her own, "Lover Man" -- at the same largo tempo.  </P> <P> Not until 55 minutes into the show, as his closer, did Ighner offer the kind of  song he should have been using occasionally all along: he woke us all up with  "Stormy Monday," which had a good feel. The trio swung; the room came alive.  </P> <P> Ighner is one of those people who need people -- to advise him on how to put  together an act. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

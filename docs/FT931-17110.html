			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Letter: Palestinians exiled not deported Sir, I would like to point out your erroneous word usage in relation to the exile of 400 Palestinians. In most articles you use 'deport', 'deportee', and 'deportation' ('Court rejects appeal to reverse Israeli expulsion of Palestinians', December 23). According to my dictionary, deportation is the 'banishment of an undesirable alien to his native country'. 'Deportation' would imply the Palestinians are 'aliens', 'undesirable' and that this practice by the Israeli government is lawful and within the right of any country. The correct terminology should be either 'exile' or 'banishment'. The term 'expulsion' is preferable to 'deportation'. J P de Rooy, 20 Copenhagen Gardens, Southfield Road, Chiswick, London W4 5NN</p>

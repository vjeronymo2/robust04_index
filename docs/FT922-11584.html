			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27): Poor relations await the right moment to perform - Capital shares / But if you believe that the UK economy is on the verge of recovery, they could help you profit from it ONE OF the most basic rules of investment is to buy at the bottom, and then hope to sell at the top. Some would argue that this applies to capital shares, which, over the past year, have come to look like the poor relations of the investment trust world. They cannot offer any income, and they do not have the fixed growth so useful for financial planning which comes with zeros (see page 25). Instead, they offer a more risky version of an investment trust share aiming for capital growth - they will only be repaid after the claims of other shares on the assets of the trust have been met. They are not, therefore, shares to invest in during times of uncertainty. As Christopher Whittingslow, of Exeter Fund Managers, puts it: 'They are a bull market play.' A bear market will severely affect their repayment values. This may explain why they have suffered severe neglect over the past few years, as markets have failed to mount a prolonged rally, and political uncertainty has intensified. There are more technical reasons for capital shares' under-performance. The recent enthusiasm for personal equity plans has placed emphasis on the tax advantages of income shares. The zeros have attracted those seeking to use up their capital gains tax allowances. Capital shares have been neglected in the rush. With private investor enthusiasm low, lack of liquidity has caused capital share prices to fall sharply. As Lewis Aaron, of Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), put it: 'When the turnover dried up, the marketmakers just didn't want to hold any stock.' He continues to point out that a second reason for their unpopularity, in recent weeks, has been political risk. Nervous investors have not felt like buying highly geared investments. Finally, split-capital investment trusts tend to invest heavily in 'high-yielding' stocks in order to pay the dividends required by the income shareholders. As Mr Aaron puts it: 'High-income shares have been the worst-performing shares in the market for the last year, and they've been underperforming by a huge margin. Obviously the performance of capital shares has been bad as well.' So it is not surprising that the BZW Capital Share Index, shows a drop of 25 per cent in the year to March 23 (a period which avoids the sharp fluctuations caused by the Gulf war), while the total return on the FT-A All Share index rose by 5 per cent. Could this be one of those fabled opportunities to buy at the bottom of the market? Many analysts seem to believe that it is - particularly now the air of political uncertainty has been dispelled. However, you need to choose carefully, because share performance can be affected by technical factors, rather than underlying investment performance. For example, the level of discount assumes more importance as a trust nears expiry. Thus, if a trust is a matter of months away from closing and showing a percentage discount to its asset value in double figures (at the time of writing, this applied to both City &amp; Commercial and Yeoman), the opportunities for short-term profit are obvious, and tempting. Exeter's Capital Growth unit trust, which invests exclusively in investment trust capital shares, aims to do precisely this, and had heavy holdings in both these trusts. However, Mr Aaron points out that this is not an easy game for the private investor - there is an opportunity cost involved in locking into these short-term gains, while for ease of management it is simpler to lock into one of the longer-term established trusts, such as River &amp; Mercantile. Certainly, discounts might seem to offer some very good bargains on longer-term stock - for example, M&amp;G Income, one of the most spectacular products of the Pep boom, was standing at a 73.8 per cent discount; while Gartmore Scotland, also launched last year, was on 75.2 per cent. Most stood at between 30 per cent and 50 per cent - considerably greater than the average for ordinary shares, which is around 16 per cent. Of course, this greater discount reflects what is perceived to be a much greater risk. Sometimes, discount figures can appear misleading. Scottish National was so heavily geared in March that the capital shares had a net asset value of zero. This meant that the shares traded at a premium - the only capital shares to do so. Mr Aaron described these shares as being 'almost like a warrant', with a highly geared exposure to stock market movements. In other words, the shares are only suitable for those with strong nerves and a conviction that the market will rise substantially. In short, it is the investment fundamentals, rather than technical features, which might attract investors to buy capital shares. Historically, they have a tendency strongly to outperform in bull markets. If you believe, after all the political argument of the past few weeks, that the UK economy is on the verge of recovery, then capital shares should offer one of the best routes to profit from it.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 15 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, political  adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat, has stated that  there is no substitute for continuing the negotiations with  Israel and expressed his belief that Israel cannot retreat from  this path.    In an interview with the newspaper AL-AHRAM on 15 April, he  said: We are now completing the first stage, which will not end  without entering Gaza and Jericho and without the Israeli  forces' withdrawal. He added that the negotiating process opens  the door to the [Israeli] withdrawal, the establishment of a  national Palestinian authority, the entry of the Palestinian  armed force from abroad in the form of police, and the entry of  the Palestinian political leadership.    He said: Since engaging in the peace process I have become  convinced that we will reach this land, that the Israeli  withdrawal is inevitable, and that there is no going back on the  process. The process may be delayed and cost lives but there is  no substitute for continuing the negotiations.    Asked about the current phase of the negotiations, he said  it  represents the last tussle at the negotiating table.    He said: We want to learn the date of the signing of the  agreement so that we can determine the withdrawal date. We have  agreed with the Israelis to complete the entry of all the  Palestinian forces during the first week after the signing and  that the "zero hour" of the Israeli withdrawal will take place  the following week. Thus there will be a dual authority for one  week to avoid a security vacuum. We also supported this. But  the question is: When will this "zero hour" come?</p>

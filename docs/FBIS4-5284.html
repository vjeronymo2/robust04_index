			<p>BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry and the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry [MITI] have taken pains for the  early resumption of the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks that  have been suspended since they were broken off at the February  Japan-U.S. summit talks. The government announced a package of  external economic measures in March, and Foreign Minister Hata  and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor are set to hold  talks in Morocco. Just when the two countries were about to  take steps to resume the framework talks, the prime minister  expressed his intention to step down. A majority of Japanese  officials in Kasumigaseki believe that with the prime minister  announcing his resignation, "clues to the resumption of the  framework talks have disappeared and the prime minister's  resignation is a negative factor in improving Japan-U.S.  relations" (according to a senior MITI official). The  possibility is growing that Japan-U.S. tensions sparked by their  trade friction could be prolonged.    It remains unclear whether Foreign Minister Hata will now  visit Morocco. A senior Foreign Ministry official said, "even  if the foreign minister goes ahead with his planned visit to  Morocco, we do not know how the United States will treat a  foreign minister who is about to resign." A top MITI official  said if a new foreign minister visits Morocco, "he would be hard  pressed to negotiate with Mr. Kantor." In any case, the prime  minister's resignation is inevitably expected to have an adverse  impact on resumption of the framework talks.    The Japanese Government had intended to use the Hata-Kantor  talks as an opportunity to sound out Mr. Kantor, who is in  charge of the framework talks, on the U.S. assessment of the  package of external economic measures; how it plans to resume  the framework talks; and specifically how Japan should move  forward the three priority sectors of insurance, government  procurement, and automobiles-auto parts to satisfy U.S. demands  for resuming the framework talks. The Foreign Ministry takes  the view that if the Hata-Kantor talks are shelved, there will  be no cabinet ministerial contact between the two countries  before "June, when the ministerial talks of the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) are held" (according  to a senior Foreign Ministry official). Hence, momentum for  resuming the framework talks is likely to come a long time after.    The government has planned to map out a package of other  external measures by the end of June, but the future of the  package remains unclear. Continued tax cuts and deregulation  are an issue, the solution of which requires a difficult process  of opinion coordination and political leadership. A Foreign  Ministry official said, "There is growing concern that if the  government is unstable, it will have an adverse impact on  mapping out the package."    The personal relationship between Prime Minister Hosokawa  and  President Clinton was good because they took office on the  platform of "reforms." Although the recent Japan-U.S. summit  talks broke off, it has not hurt their personal relationship of  trust, and the U.S. administration takes the rather firm view  that "Japanese bureaucrats stand in the way of resolving  bilateral issues." There is a possibility, however, that the  United States will step up its criticism of Japanese bureaucrats  after Mr. Hosokawa resigns as prime minister, clouding prospects  for improved Japan-U.S. relations.</p>

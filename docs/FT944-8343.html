			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Islamic fundamentalists force Arafat to remove his kid gloves: Julian Ozanne assesses the Palestinian leader's position after Friday's killings Mr Yassir Arafat's Palestinian self-rule authority is fighting a battle with a resurgent Islamic opposition for the minds and hearts of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip. Although far from over, it is a battle he is so far losing. Mounting confrontation between the authority and the Hamas Islamic Resistance and Islamic Jihad - the two Islamic militant groups opposed to peace with Israel - has strengthened the hand of Mr Arafat's opponents. Exploiting Mr Arafat's apparent weakness and his inability to deliver on promises of Palestinian liberation, the Islamic opposition has openly challenged the Palestinian leader's authority on the streets of Gaza, culminating in last Friday's killing of 13 Palestinians in internal violence. 'There has been a big increase in support for Hamas,' says Mr Raji Sourani, head of the Gaza Rights and Law office. 'But it's important to distinguish support for their actions against support for their long-term goals. Few Palestinians want to see an Islamic state but there is increasing frustration and anger about a lack of progress and the Islamic groups are using it.' Hamas and Jihad have vowed to continue attacks on Israel until the Jewish state is forced to surrender all occupied Arab land from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea. Many Palestinians see Hamas and Jihad attacks as legitimate resistance to Israeli occupation and are increasingly discontented, with Mr Arafat who is locked into a peace process which appears to many Palestinians to be going nowhere. Hamas and Jihad leaders know that attacks against Israel win them support. 'The peace agreement has deprived Palestinians of their rights and it is our right to resist occupation,' says Sheikh Abdullah Shammi, a leader of Islamic Jihad. 'We are going to continue attacks against Jews anywhere and make them feel they can have no security on our land, and we know this is going to make us stronger with the Palestinian people because we are now the only hope for Palestinian rights.' In the aftermath of Friday's killings both Jihad and Hamas have tried to portray themselves as the victims of oppression by Mr Arafat. In a culture steeped in the political and religious values of martyrdom, the deaths are likely to add to the appeal of the Islamic groups. Publicly Hamas and Jihad deny they are seeking confrontation with the Palestinian Authority and are anxious to rule out the threat of civil war. Since Friday Islamic leaders have urged their supporters to step back from violent conflict with Mr Arafat and turn their guns on Israel. 'Nobody can push us to a civil war,' said Sheikh Abdullah Izak of Islamic Jihad. 'There will be more military activities against Israel but we don't want confrontation with the authority. Arafat and the authority are our brothers.' But political observers believe that much of Hamas rhetoric is for internal consumption because they do not want to be perceived by Palestinians as challenging the authority and risking civil war. They are determined to sabotage Mr Arafat's rule and force him into confrontation because they see the authority and the peace agreement as an obstacle to liberating the historical land of Palestine. 'The Islamic movement is greedy for power but it is not sure that they have yet decided to go for power,' says Mr Sourani. 'They don't think like other political groups in terms of ultimate political goals. For them it is quite enough to go along with the struggle, which could take generations. It might involve destroying Arafat and if there is chaos they don't mind so long as they can keep the struggle alive and openly confront Israel.' Furthermore the Islamic movement is diverse and often speaks with different voices. While some leaders have called for dialogue and reconciliation, others have said it is impossible to reach a modus vivendi with the Authority. Since his return to Gaza five months ago Mr Arafat has treated the Islamic opposition with kid gloves against the advice of hardliners such as Gen Nasr Yussuf, overall Palestinian military commander. Like his opponents he has been anxious to avoid the possibility of civil war. But his authority has been so openly flouted that before Friday's confrontation it was beginning to look as if he was not in control of the streets. Senior advisers to Mr Arafat say that unless the Authority cracks down further they will be drawn into a battle which could attract Islamic activists from the region who will see Gaza as a soft target. It is a fear which is shared in neighbouring Egypt. President Hosni Mubarak warned on Friday that 'without giving the Palestinians hope, Gaza could become a base for destabilisation that will affect not only the Middle East. . . It is going to affect Europe. It is very easy to go from here to Europe especially as you have cells of fundamentalists all over Europe now.' Mr Arafat yesterday called for national unity but said he would not allow any force from outside to harm the Palestinian dream. The Authority has repeatedly said since Friday that outside elements provoked the conflict, a tacit reference to extremist groups in Syria and Iranian Islamic fundamentalists. As if to prove the claim, angry Iranian students protested outside the Palestinian mission in Tehran yesterday calling Mr Arafat a tool of Zionism. A leading Iranian cleric said revenge should be taken against Israel and the US but that 'Arafat and his clique come next in line to be punished'. Since Friday there has been a stand-off between the Palestinian authority and the Islamic groups, mediated by Israeli Arabs and independent Palestinians. But Mr Sourani warns: 'Neither side can afford to retreat because one step backward means a loss of control.' Both sides are carefully weighing the risks of further violence.</p>

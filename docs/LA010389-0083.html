			<p><P> January 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FIRMS EXAMINE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL COSTS;  </P> <P> EXECUTIVES SEEK WAYS TO CUT BACK, SURVEY SAYS  </P> <P> Many companies will begin 1989 by trying to streamline and reduce travel and  entertainment costs, one of the largest controllable expenses for many firms.  </P> <P> With airlines making 150,000 fare changes a day, it is no surprise that  corporate travel expenses frequently soar out of control, according to American  Express travel consultant Judith Dettinger-Gardner.  </P> <P> In 1988, American companies spent an estimated $95 billion on travel and  entertainment. By 1990, the amount is expected to reach $115 billion.  </P> <P> According to the American Express 1988 travel management survey, travel and  entertainment expenses are the third-largest controllable expense for most  companies, after salaries and data processing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Seek Out Best Fares  </P> <P> Dettinger-Gardner, who oversees the American Express Survey of Business Travel  Management, said a company can save 30% to 35% on travel expenses by requiring  employees to purchase the lowest logical air fare when they travel on business.  </P> <P> "Companies should establish a good travel policy and distribute it to  everyone," said Dettinger-Gardner. "Then they should find a good travel agency  to help monitor and control expenses."  </P> <P> Even the smallest business can benefit from a good relationship with a  reputable agent who seeks the most economical fares and provides a detailed,  monthly travel report to the company, Dettinger-Gardner said. Too many  companies create a flurry of paper work and confusion by relying on too many  travel agents. In fact, Dettinger-Gardner recently consulted with one Fortune  500 company that was using 273 different travel agencies.  </P> <P> Trying to manage travel and entertainment expenses has become a major concern  for executives, according to the survey. Fifty-five percent of the respondents  from 1,600 companies, government and educational organization said rising  travel and entertainment costs represent one of management's top concerns.  Sixty-two percent of the respondents believed that employee travel is  occasionally abused and must be closely monitored. And 29% of the respondents  have hired a corporate travel manager, up from 16% two years ago.  </P> <P> Internally, a company can do several things to keep a tighter rein on travel  costs. Dettinger-Gardner said it is cheaper in the long run to issue credit  cards to employees who travel frequently, rather than offer large cash  advances, which are frequently misspent. A small cash advance of $10 or $15 a  day to cover tips, tolls and taxis is enough for most trips, she said.  </P> <P> Companies that provide generous meal allowances and do not require receipts for  expenses less than $25 also encourage travel expense abuse, according to  Dettinger-Gardner. She suggests that companies require receipts for any travel  or entertainment expense of more than $10 or $15. And, she recommends that  someone carefully check the receipts to make sure they are legitimate.  </P> <P> "One fellow we encountered visited three major cities but turned in  consecutively numbered tear tab (receipts) that he bought at a stationery  store," said Dettinger-Gardner.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Questioning Traveler  </P> <P> One way to reduce abuse is to do more than just add up the math on travel  expense reports, according to Dettinger-Gardner. She said the person reviewing  expense reports should check to see where and how the airline tickets were  purchased and question the traveler if the tickets were not purchased through  the company's authorized travel agent. Frequent flier programs that reward  travelers with free trips are also "a big problem" for businesses, according to  Dettinger-Gardner.  </P> <P> "They entice travelers to make decisions not based on price," she said, adding  that it is nearly impossible for a company to keep track of frequent flier  mileage or require employees to turn in their free trips.  </P> <P> "One company hired seven people to keep track of the frequent flier miles," she  said. "And even with that, only two out of 200 people turned in their free  trips to the company."  </P> <P> PUTTING THE BRAKES ON TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT COSTS  </P> <P> Nearly 40% of the executives surveyed said travel and entertainment costs  increased by at least 10% between 1986 and 1987.  </P> <P> Increased 10% or more: 38%  </P> <P> Increased less than 10%: 29%  </P> <P> Remained the same: 14%  </P> <P> Decreased: 16%  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fewer than half of those surveyed -- 42% -- said they felt "extremely" or  "very" successful at managing costs.  </P> <P> Somewhat successful: 47%  </P> <P> Very successful: 35%  </P> <P> Slightly successful: 10%  </P> <P> Extremely successful: 7%  </P> <P> Not at all successful: 1%  </P> <P> </P> <P> The following cost-control measures were found to be effective by more than 60%  of survey respondents.  </P> <P> Tighten receipt requirements: 67%  </P> <P> Require travelers to take lowest 'logical' airfare: 66%  </P> <P> Consolidate travel arrangements to fewer travel agencies: 63%  </P> <P> Designate mid-level manager to handle travel: 63%  </P></p>

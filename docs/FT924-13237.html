			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Bonds: UK expected to launch DM5bn Eurobond THE EXPECTATION that the UK is about to launch a DM5bn five-year Eurobond focused renewed attention on the D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market yesterday. A number of banks are vying to win the mandate to arrange the financing, but the timing and details of the issue are still unclear. The Bank of England declined to comment on any financing plans. Last month, the UK announced an Ecu10bn financing package, consisting of an Ecu5bn three-year loan and an Ecu5bn note issuance programme. No paper has yet been issued under the programme. Although a number of European sovereign borrowers - including Norway, Belgium, Finland and Italy, as well as the UK - have been eyeing the burgeoning D-Mark sector of the Eurobond market, the recent heavy supply of paper has increased funding costs for foreign borrowers, by eroding swap opportunities. Higher funding costs could deter some potential issuers. If the UK were to launch a deal priced to yield five basis points more than the comparable German bund, as some dealers suggest, that would translate into funding costs of 15 basis points below the London interbank offered rate, if the proceeds were swapped, dealers said. Most borrowers will find it impossible to achieve sub-Libor funding in the sector. However, the sector is one of the few still open for large offerings, and sovereign borrowers with urgent needs to replenish foreign exchange reserves, for example, may decide to press ahead. Despite recent supply, investor interest in the sector remains buoyant. Sweden's DM2.5bn five-year deal launched earlier this week showed that large benchmark offerings can attract a broad range of institutional investors to the sector. Yesterday, a DM200m issue by Finnish Export Credit added further supply to the sector. The three-year issue, via Merrill Lynch Bank, was launched under FEK's medium-term note programme. The paper was considered fairly priced at a spread of 50 basis points above the comparable German bond yield, but dealers said concerns about Finland's creditworthiness deterred some investors. Elsewhere, the financing arm of Transportacion Maritima Mexicano launched a Dollars 75m five-year deal with a step-up coupon, and UBS Finance issued Dollars 150m of floating-rate notes due 2002.</p>

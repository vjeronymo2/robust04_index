			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Keating unlikely to testify before inquiry into newspaper ownership Australia's prime minister Paul Keating yesterday indicated he was unlikely to give evidence to a Senate committee which would look into foreign ownership of Australian newspapers. Approval for the new committee is expected later this week, after its terms of reference were tabled in parliament yesterday. Under these, the committee would look into 'the origin and basis for decisions in 1991 and 1993 to increase the permissible percentage of foreign ownership of newspapers' and 'whether those decisions were influenced by considerations relating to the content of newspapers including the requirement for 'balanced' coverage'. It would also consider the effectiveness of Foreign Investment Review Board rules. The committee would be made up of four senators from the ruling Labor party, four from the opposition, and one nominated by the minority Australian Democrats. It could request that people appear before it, but could not demand they give evidence. The committee's formation has been spurred by disclosures that Mr Keating demanded more balanced coverage from the John Fairfax newspapers, including the Sydney Morning Herald, Melbourne Age and Australian Financial Review, as a precondition to any increase in the stake held by Mr Conrad Black, the Canadian media tycoon. The conversation between Mr Keating and Mr Black took place before the federal election. After the March election, the cabinet approved an increase from 15 to 25 per cent in Mr Black's interest. But the prime minister, under attack over the Fairfax decision during parliamentary question time yesterday, told the opposition: 'Listen, brother. . . I know my place in the world. I do not slum it before senate committees.' Mr Keating defended the government's handling of the Fairfax issue, denying any impropriety had occurred, and accused Mr John Hewson, the opposition leader, of promising Mr Black a much larger stake. Chances of passage this year of the government's contentious land rights legislation, to set up a system for dealing with native title claims, dwindled yesterday when the two Green party senators gave conditional support to a Senate inquiry into the package. The government lacks a majority in the Senate, and minority parties hold the balance of power.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 30 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Monday [30 May] the yen could appreciate further against  the dollar if Japan does not open its markets further and relax  more government regulations.    Hata made the comment during a meeting with Shoichiro  Toyoda,  chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations  (Keidanren), at his official residence, a Keidanren official  said.    Toyoda urged Hata to finish work on the long-overdue fiscal  1994 budget and carry out political reforms by redrafting the  electoral map for single-seat districts.    Acknowledging deregulation is the Hata cabinet's priority,  Toyoda pointed to the need to establish a system to monitor  progress in relaxing government controls.    Hata replied that market opening and deregulation is a task  Japan can accomplish on its own, but not one which can be done  purely at the behest of foreign governments.    In other remarks, Hata reiterated that if snap elections are  called, they should be held under the new system of single-seat  districts.    Opposition parties are pressing Hata to resign or call snap  elections as soon after the state budget goes through the Diet.  They have threatened to submit a no-confidence motion against  the minority Hata administration once the budget is passed.</p>

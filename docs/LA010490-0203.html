			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NORIEGA DEFIES COURT;  </P> <P> HE SPURNS U.S. JUSTICE BUT JUDGE ENTERS INNOCENT PLEA;  </P> <P> PANAMANIAN DICTATOR UNDER TIGHT SECURITY  </P> <P> Fallen Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega refused today to recognize the  jurisdiction of a U.S. court and a judge entered a plea of not guilty on  charges that he took $4.6 million to turn his nation into a way station for the  cocaine trade.  </P> <P> Noriega surrendered Wednesday night to U.S. troops outside Panama City's  Vatican Embassy 10 days after he took refuge there, and was flown into  Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami under cover of night.  </P> <P> U.S. marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area continuously from atop  the federal courthouse and patrolled halls in plain clothes, but otherwise kept  a low profile in what U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said was an  effort to treat Noriega like any other defendant.  </P> <P> His attorneys, however, argued that he is anything but a normal drug suspect.  </P> <P> "We cannot submit to the jurisdiction of this court. Gen. Noriega will stand  mute at the arraignment," defense attorney Frank Rubino said as he and  co-counsel Steven Kollin waited to see their client for the first time since  his surrender.  </P> <P> Exactly a year ago, Hoeveler had ruled that the United States has jurisdiction  over Noriega, rejecting defense claims of immunity for a head of state. The  judge said the State Department never recognized Noriega's political  legitimacy.  </P> <P> Kollin has noted other potential legal pitfalls in the case, including extreme  pretrial publicity and Noriega's links with U.S. intelligence agencies, but  U.S. Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh said he was confident the case was solid.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush and other White  House officials will be careful about what they say lest they prejudice the  trial.  </P> <P> Noriega's surrender was met with joyous celebrations in the streets of Panama  City and Miami that continued today.  </P> <P> The general -- who had ruled for six years, thumbed his nose at two U.S.  Presidents and annulled a 1989 election he apparently was losing -- gave up,  still wearing his military uniform, after realizing even his supporters had  turned against him, the archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath, said today.  </P> <P> "The people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is leaving our  land," said Panamanian President Guillermo Endara, frequently a target of  Noriega's thugs.  </P> <P> An indictment accuses Noriega, who is in his 50s, of accepting $4.6 million in  bribes from Colombian drug cartels to aid and protect their smuggling and  processing -- charges that carry 145 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines.  </P> <P> Noriega is not covered by the new U.S. law allowing execution of drug kingpins,  an assurance he reportedly demanded before turning himself in. He also faces  drug charges in Tampa.  </P> <P> The indictment names 15 other people, including the reputed head of the  Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo Escobar Gaviria, who is being hunted by  Colombian authorities.  </P> <P> One of Noriega's right-hand men, Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, surrendered to U.S.  troops after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama and has pleaded innocent.  Prosecutors have refused to say if he will testify against his former boss.  </P> <P> U.S. troops who seized Noriega's military headquarters in Panama City  reportedly found documents and files supporting the prosecution case.  </P> <P> That, along with the arrests of Del Cid and other minor figures, has made the  case stronger than when the indictment was issued two years ago, said Richard  Gregorie, who headed the investigation until he left the U.S. attorney's office  a year ago.  </P> <P> U.S. officials said today that Noriega was handcuffed and advised of his legal  rights as an accused drug trafficker as he flew back to the United States under  jet fighter escort.  </P> <P> The Pentagon said Noriega traded his general's uniform for a one-piece flight  suit and took off in an Air Force C-130 for Miami only 43 minutes after he  surrendered to U.S. troops at the Vatican Embassy in Panama City Wednesday  night.  </P> <P> The troops took Noriega from the embassy to Howard Air Base in a helicopter and  turned him over to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials before he was  put aboard the C-130, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.  </P> <P> "On board the plane, two U.S. military doctors examined him and pronounced him  fit to fly," Williams said, adding that Noriega was made to trade his brown  slacks and tan shirt with military emblems for a zippered Air Force flight  suit.  </P> <P> White House spokesman Fitzwater told reporters that Noriega was handcuffed at  one point, although he could not say how long the handcuffs were kept on.  </P> <P> Justice Department spokesman David Runkel told reporters a DEA agent read  Noriega his constitutional rights in Spanish aboard the plane after it took  off, taking Noriega to Florida to face drug-trafficking charges.  </P> <P> Runkel was unable to say whether the agent questioned Noriega after telling him  he had the right to remain silent or to have an attorney present during  questioning.  </P> <P> PANAMANIANS CELEBRATE ARREST OF NORIEGA: P12  </P></p>

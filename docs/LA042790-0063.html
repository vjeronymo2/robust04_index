			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW;  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA CUCINA REVIVES THE ORDINARY  </P> <P> No matter how fresh the food products, it still takes care and skill, if not  talent, to make them into appealing dishes.  </P> <P> So, when a restaurant such as California Cucina, located in a new shopping  strip in Toluca Lake, offers freshness and vitality of flavor, I pay attention.  </P> <P> Although it's not consistently excellent, California Cucina's successes are  notable. For one thing, it made me reconsider dishes that are so consistently  poorly made that I had stopped taking them seriously.  </P> <P> One of the greatest offenders in this category is ratatouille -- I've come to  call it the gray vegetable. Many other restaurants serve it as an almost always  cold, overcooked vegetable stew whose original flavors have been leached out  and replaced with mysterious seasonings.  </P> <P> But the hot ratatouille at California Cucina serves as a base for grilled  Italian sausage. You get whole, flavorsome tomato concasse with smaller  quantities of full-textured diced eggplant and sliced zucchini shot through  with sprigs of fresh rosemary. It is as alive, vital and colorful as if it were  being served in Provence.  </P> <P> Angel hair pasta with a similar sauce (basil is the predominant herb here) is  equally impressive, although the scallops served when I ate there were somewhat  overdone.  </P> <P> Another surprise, or even shock -- the fried mozzarella. Testing the  restaurant's culinary limits, I ordered the dish, which is probably the most  butchered of all Italian-inspired dishes. But here, the cheese was thinly  sliced so that it was warmed through and through, the fried coating was  delicate, and the vibrant tomato concasse and basil were underneath, where they  belong. Now this dish has re-entered my active mental menu.  </P> <P> I also enjoyed the cream-sauce dishes. Linguine with a walnut-Gorgonzola cream  sauce was very rich, but the flavors were well-balanced. So was a rib-eye steak  in a green peppercorn sauce. Salads also were appealing, though there wasn't  much "Caesar" to the Caesar.  </P> <P> California Cucina serves a number of dishes that are far superior to what you'd  expect to get in a shopping strip or most anywhere, for that matter. Not only  is the cooking a surprise, so are the portions and the prices: the former  generous, the latter reasonable. However, the service, though speedy, could use  some polish.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: fried mozzarella with tomato basil sauce, $5.25; angel hair  pasta with tomato, garlic and basil, $6; linguine with walnut-Gorgonzola cream  sauce, $6.50; Italian sausage with ratatouille, $6.50.  </P> <P>  California Cucina, 10658 Riverside Drive, Toluca Lake.

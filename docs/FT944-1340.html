			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Danes back shipyard complaint The Danish government is to back a complaint to the European Court by Danish shipbuilders against German government subsidies to four shipyards in the former East Germany. The Danish shipyards claim the German government and the EU Commission have exceeded their authority when awarding subsidies to the shipyards. Bonn was authorised by the EU's seventh shipbuilding directive to pay re-structuring subsidies of DM6.2bn (Pounds 2.5bn) on condition that the yards' capacity was reduced. The Danes say the shipyards' capacity will be substantially increased.</p>

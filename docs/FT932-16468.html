			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / Tax burden 'set to hit four-year high' TAXATION as a proportion of national income is set to rise this year to the highest level for four years, according to the Adam Smith Institute, the free market think tank. It says the proportion will rise this year to 41.68 per cent from 39.43 per cent last year and 42.18 per cent in 1989. The institute says the change is 'deeply disturbing', adding that after the early 1980s, when taxation as a proportion of national income fell back, Britain 'is once more becoming a high tax economy, less attractive for foreign investors and less friendly to home grown entrepreneurs'. Some of the increase is due to the recession which has pushed up social security spending while income has fallen, the institute says.

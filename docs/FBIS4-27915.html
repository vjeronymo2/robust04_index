			<p>CSO     [Text] In a news conference held on 26 May, President Kazuo  Fujimori of electric-power company-affiliated regional telephone  company Tokyo Tsushin Network (TTNet) stated, "We have asked the  Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications [MOPT] to consider as  an issue for research," the partial interconnection of circuits  among Type I telecommunications operators that own and offer  communication services. In the past, the MOPT had rejected the  idea because it could have a major impact on long-distance  communications operators such as DDI and that the change "was  unnecessary." The informal U.S. request for deregulation of the  communications industry may serve as a trigger for a change in  MOPT policy concerning interconnections.    In reference to the linking of communications networks owned  by the nine electric-power company-affiliated regional telephone  companies, TTNet President Fujimori comments, "We have asked the  MOPT to consider the linking of adjacent telephone companies as  a matter for research. However, because of the existence of  three new long-distance telephone companies, it will be  difficult to link all regional telephone companies."    There is a strongly rooted view that the linkage of regional  telephone companies is an idea that should be developed to  provide competition for Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT),  which monopolizes urban telecommunications networks. However,  the decontrol programs that went into effect in 1985 provided  for a division of operating areas designed to ensure a specified  revenue and profit base for long-distance and regional telephone  companies and did not authorize direct links among regional  telephone companies.    On the other hand, at the regular press conference on 24  May,  MOPT Administrative Vice Minister Futoshi Shirai referred to the  U.S. request for deregulation and expressed caution, saying, "We  have not received a formal request, but there is a need to study  the proposal for consistency with basic concepts of the past."    After the press conference, Vice Minister Shirai said, "I  have heard that there is hardly any need for such linkage,"  reinforcing the past position of the MOPT.</p>

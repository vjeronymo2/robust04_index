			<p><P> December 30, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE NO-SHOW BOWL  </P> <P> Three times in the five previous Freedom Bowls, at least a quarter of those who  bought tickets have failed to show up for the game. On at least one occasion  weather may have accounted for those who shelled out and then didn't attend --  it was raining at game time the first time the bell rang for a Freedom Bowl, in  1984. The fewest no-shows, 10%, occurred in 1986 -- perhaps because UCLA was  appearing in the game.  </P> <P> </P> <P> FREEDOM BOWL TICKETS SOLD, ATTENDANCE  </P> <P> 1986:  </P> <P> Tickets Sold: 56,910  </P> <P> Attendance: 51,422  </P> <P> 1988:  </P> <P> Tickets Sold: 49,694  </P> <P> Attendance: 35,941  </P> <P> Source: Freedom Bowl Inc.  </P></p>

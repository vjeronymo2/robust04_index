			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Ministers 'kept in dark' on supergun MINISTERS were kept in the dark about a large contract to supply explosive propellant for the Iraqi supergun, a senior civil servant admitted yesterday. Mr Nicholas Bevan, an under-secretary at the Ministry of Defence, told MPs at the Commons trade and industry committee investigating the supergun affair that Foreign Office officials made overtures to the Belgian government about the order without any ministerial approval or knowledge. The MoD was told about the order by Astra, the UK munitions company, which had discovered the propellants deal on the order books of PRB, a newly acquired subsidiary, in the autumn of 1989, six months before British customs officials seized barrel parts for the supergun after an intelligence tip-off. Mr Bevan said the Astra information was passed on to the Foreign Office but no ministers were told about it. 'I saw no reason why ministers should know,' he said. He added: 'Ministers were not informed. The Foreign Office decided it was not necessary to inform ministers before approaching the Belgian government'. Mr Alan Clark, defence procurement minister, sitting next to Mr Bevan in the committee, said he only found out about the supergun the following April at the time of the seizure. Asked by Mr Jim Cousins, Labour MP for Newcastle upon Tyne Central, if he was content that such a sensitive matter should be handled exclusively by officials, Mr Clark replied: 'Not entirely.' Mr Cousins pointed out to Mr Bevan that at the time a Belgian aircraft had already dispatched propellant bound for Iraq. He said: 'You were happy to leave the matter in the hands of a government that you knew had already used its own aircraft to ship the propellant on to Iraq?' Mr Bevan said there had been nothing else that British officials could do since the export from Belgian did not contravene British law. He said the decision to make the approach without informing ministers had been taken by Mr Roger Harding, who at the time was director-general of marketing at the MoD. Mr Gerald James, the former chairman of Astra, told the committee at an earlier session that when the company first acquired PRB and before he made any approach to government officials, he had been warned by Mr Harding to disclose any suspicious orders on the PRB books to the MoD.</p>

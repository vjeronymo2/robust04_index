			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Leading Article: Competition on line IT IS something of an achievement that the European Commission has agreed on any plan to liberalise the Community's telecommunications market in the face of determined lobbying by many phone companies to protect their monopoly positions. But the particular approach agreed this week is distinctly unambitious and will saddle the European economy with an uncompetitive telecommunications sector for much longer than is necessary. There is also a risk that the plan could be further diluted, as it must receive the blessing of the Council of Ministers before it becomes law. The Commission's plan involves the abolition from 1998 of the phone companies' monopolies to provide basic voice services, which account for about 90 per cent of the Ecu 100bn (Pounds 78.7bn) a year market. (Data communications and specialised voice services are already largely liberalised.) The five-year delay is designed to appease the monopoly phone companies and their governments, which in most cases still own them and act as spokesmen for their interests. Pressures from producer interests also explain the dilution of proposals originally drawn up by the Commission's competition directorate. These would have allowed competition in the provision of cross-border phone services several years earlier and would have permitted infrastructure competition for those services where monopoly rights have been abolished. The latter idea would have appealed to groups such as cable television, railway and electricity companies which already have telecommunications networks of their own. Public interest The problem - as too often - is that producer interests have dominated and the wider public interest has been marginalised. The decision on telecommunications does not set an encouraging precedent, given that there are other monopolies - particularly gas, electricity and post services - to which the Commission should be turning its attention. European businesses suffer a competitive disadvantage by comparison with their US and Japanese counterparts, which enjoy competitive telecommunications markets. Cross-border calls in Europe are between three and six times as expensive as calls over a similar distance in the US, while private circuit charges can be 10 or more times the price. Domestic consumers Nor has the monopoly served domestic customers well. In some countries, consumers can wait six months to be connected to the network and, in regions such as eastern Germany, the wait can be even longer. Unfortunately, the Commission has bought the argument that the more backward a region or country, the longer it should have to adjust to competition. The truth is that the more backward a region the more desperately it needs competition so that its infrastructure can be modernised more quickly. It is not even clear that the system is good for the monopolists, as some - the most recent convert appears to be France Telecom - realise. The absence of competition explains why the European market is shrivelled by comparison with America's. There are 20 per cent fewer phone lines per head of population and each line is used only a third as much. Innovations - such as freephone services, voice messaging, call-waiting and call-forwarding - are also much more common on the other side of the Atlantic. That is despite the fact that the Community has been pouring cash into research projects such as Race which are designed to encourage the development of an advanced communications infrastructure for Europe. Europe cannot afford to continue like this. Telecoms companies obviously need time to adjust to a new competitive regime. But that is no excuse for endless delay. The companies should recognise that competitive markets are in their long-run interests. If they fail to, consumers will have to speak with louder voices. And politicians will have to liberate themselves from the grip of their monopoly lobbies and articulate the wider public interest.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Mikhail Shevtsov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 26 TASS -- The Chechen leadership reacted  negatively to the possible expansion of the zone under state of  emergency in some parts of the Sunzha and Malgabek districts in  Ingushetia.    According to the CHECHENPRESS news agency, Chechnya has put  its troops on alert, the cabinet of ministers will be working in  accordance with a "military" schedule for one week. Members of  the cabinet came to a today's meeting in a military uniform.    The spreading of the zone under state of emergency to a part  of the Sunzha and Malgabek districts in Ingushetia is regarded  by the official Groznyy as an "act of open armed aggression",  the Chechen department of press and information told ITAR-TASS.    Political observers in Groznyy believe that the initiative  of  the temporary administration on the expansion of the zone under  state of emergency in Ingushetia may disrupt a planned meeting  between Dzhokhar Dudayev and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.    CHECHENPRESS reports that the official authorities of Nazran  believe that an attempt to impose state of emergency in the  Malgabek and Sunzha districts in Ingushetia may destabilise the  situation in north Caucasus.    At the same time the draft decree on the prolongation of  state of emergency for another term was agreed with Ingush  President Ruslan Aushev, head of the temporary administration in  Moscow Vladimir Lozovoy told ITAR-TASS.    This decree really envisages the need to ensure normal work  conditions for the forces attached to the temporary  administration in some populated localities in the Sunzha and  Malgabek districts of Ingushetia. This measure became necessary  because a number of provocations took place exactly in those  areas, and the presence of the Chechen police was reported there.    Vladimir Lozovoy has no information about an official  reaction of the Chechen leadership to the draft decree. The  decree has not yet been adopted and therefore it is not worth  commenting on this decree before it is issued, the head of the  temporary administration pointed out.</p>

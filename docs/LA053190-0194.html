			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL PLANETARIUMS PUT THE STARS ALMOST WITHIN REACH  </P> <P> Planetariums offer Southern Californians the opportunity to explore the moon,  the sun, the stars and other celestial landmarks.  </P> <P> "The planetarium is like a zoo, showing you things that don't exist in your  neighborhood any longer," said John Mosley, program supervisor at Griffith  Observatory in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A planetarium, he said, lets whoever is operating it "manipulate" the sky.  </P> <P> "From your own back yard, it's pretty static. But in a planetarium, we can  accelerate time, we can watch the motions of a planet through months and see  eclipses happen," Mosley said.  </P> <P> Regularly scheduled public programs and special shows are offered at the  following Southland planetariums:  </P> <P> * Griffith Observatory, Planetarium and Hall of Science in Los Angeles: The  large telescope on the roof is open for free viewing on clear nights (except  Mondays) from dark until 9:45 p.m.  </P> <P> The Hall of Science, which features exhibits on astronomy and the physical  sciences, opens at 2 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays and 12:30 p.m. Saturdays and  Sundays and closes at 10 p.m. Closed Mondays.  </P> <P> Admission to planetarium shows is $3 for adults, $2 for seniors 65 and older,  $1.50 for ages 5-12. Children under 5 are admitted only to special 1:30 p.m.  shows. Laserium shows require separate admission. Call (818) 997-3624.  </P> <P> The observatory is located at 2800 E.

Fleet Space Theater and Science Center in San Diego: Before every  main Omnimax film feature is a 10-minute planetarium show related to the film.  </P> <P> Daily show times are 2:30, 5:30 and 8 p.m., with an 11:30 a.m. show Saturdays  and Sundays. Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for juniors ages 5-15, $3.50 for  seniors 60 and over. Children under 5 are free.  </P> <P> Beginning July 17 (and thereafter on the first Tuesday of each month), the 7  p.m. program will be a full-length planetarium show designed to familiarize  visitors with the night sky. These programs, led by an astronomer, will precede  stargazing with telescopes.  </P> <P> The Science Center, which has hands-on exhibits for all ages, is open 9:15 a.m.  to 9:30 p.m., Sundays-Thursdays, and until 10:30 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.

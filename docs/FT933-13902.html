			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Weyerhauser profits almost double WEYERHAUSER, the forest products group based in the Pacific Northwest, yesterday reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 181.5m, almost double the Dollars 92.9m the company earned in the same quarter of 1992. Quarterly income, however, was boosted by a one-time Dollars 36m gain from the sale of its subsidiary, GNA Corp. Although profits were higher than a year ago, they were lower than the first quarter of this year, when the company earned Dollars 229m, which included a Dollars 44m extraordinary gain from the sale of Weyerhauser's nappy business. Overall, the favourable pricing environment continues to provide a foundation for strong earnings at Weyerhauser. Environmental constraints on logging in the Pacific Northwest, designed to help preserve endangered species of owl, have pushed prices for logs, lumber and plywood sharply higher this year. The company said it had also benefited from cost and productivity improvements. Weyerhauser's timberlands and wood products business earned Dollars 241.8m in the quarter, and its pulp and paper business Dollars 44.4m. The real estate and financial services units brought in Dollars 12.2m. Yesterday's earnings news failed to impress investors, who sold Weyerhauser's stock down Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. Boise Cascade, the Idaho-based paper, office and building products company, yesterday reported a reduced loss for the second quarter of 1993 of Dollars 17.1m, down sharply from the Dollars 45.4m shortfall recorded in the same three months of 1992. The latest loss, however, was slightly larger than the Dollars 12.1m incurred in the first quarter of this year. This was primarily a reflection of a modest slowdown in sales during the past three months and a sharp drop in lumber and plywood prices, which hit Boise Cascade's building products division. Overall, sales totalled Dollars 974m between April and June, compared with Dollars 984m in the previous quarter. Losses from the company's paper business were significantly lower than a year ago and three months ago, thanks to flat-to-higher pulp and paper prices, and a reduction in unit manufacturing costs. However, Mr John Fery, chairman of Boise Cascade, said market conditions in the paper business remained difficult, although he expected paper prices to rise further in the third quarter. The office products division enjoyed a good quarter, with dollar sales volume rising 7.5 per cent from the year-ago period. Income from the building products unit was also higher than a year ago, but was down significantly from the first quarter due to lower lumber and plywood prices. Boise Cascade shares were little changed on the New York Stock Exchange, down just Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 22 1/2 .</p>

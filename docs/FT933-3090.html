			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa futures climb to fresh highs THE LONDON cocoa market continued its recent upward trend yesterday as bullish sentiment was fuelled by rumours of defaults on Indonesian shipments. For while it looked as though an assault would be mounted on the psychological barrier at Pounds 900 a tonne for the December futures position; but the rise faltered at Pounds 890 and by the close the December contract had eased back to Pounds 880 a tonne, up Pounds 13 on the day and the highest second position close for 38-months. Dealers were undaunted, however, and most thought further gains were on the way. 'We had been forecasting that the December price would reach 1,000 by the end of the year,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles, commodities analyst at GNI, the London trade house. 'Now it looks as though it could make that by the end of the month.' To achieve that level, he noted, further technical hurdles would have to be cleared at Pounds 958 a tonne, the life-of-contract high for the December position, and at Pounds 967, the long-time high for the second position (reached on May 24, 1990). The main inspiration behind the latest upsurge, which lifted the December quotation by Pounds 30 last week and has added another Pounds 24 so far this week, has been the growing conviction that the level of world stocks is set to fall heavily. Mr Eagles explained that the settlement of disposal arrangements for the 230,000 tonnes in the International Cocoa Organisation buffer stock, under which regular monthly releases will be made, meant that the buffer stock effectively became a supplier and that its beans could be deleted from overall stocks. Together with an expected world production shortfall of between 200,000 and 300,000 tonnes in the coming season, that meant that the world cocoa stock, about 1.2m tonnes at present, would shrink by between 430,000 and 530,000 tonnes. Further upward pressure has been provided of late, Mr Eagles said, by the lifting of 'short hedges' (market insurances against price falls) as operators became more confident about the outlook for prices. In addition, he said, speculators who had gambled on a substantial 'correction' being made to the recent price rise were cutting their losses and making covering purchases.</p>

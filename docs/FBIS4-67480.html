			<p>BFN     [Text] Bandar Seri Begawan -- ASEAN senior officials  yesterday completed the draft of the Bandar Seri Begawan  Resolution as a guideline for closer cooperation on the  environment among member countries. The resolution will be  proposed to environment ministers of Asean during the sixth  ministerial meeting on the environment in Brunei's capital  tomorrow.    Representing Thailand will be Deputy Minister of Science,  Technology and Environment Pricha Musikun.    On the agenda are:    -- The Asean plan of action on the environment;    -- The launching of Asean Environment Year 1995;    -- The quality standards for air and river water; and    -- Regional cooperation for the management and control of  transboundary movements of hazardous wastes into and within the  region.    It was initially agreed that some significant framework and  guidelines be established under the Asean strategic plan of  action, the officials said.    "The member countries are working to develop a common stand  on some international forums like the biodiversity and Basel  conventions," a Thai delegate said.    The strategy encompasses such issues as the implementation  of  the so-called Agenda 21, the development of policy directions  and the extension of operational and technical cooperation on  the environment. At the same time, there will be a study on the  implementation of the Asean Free Trade Area on the environment.    Senior officials endorsed the Asean Environment Year --  Asean  Green and Clean -- at the meeting.    Asean Environment Year, which is the initiative of Thailand,  aims to promote public awareness of environmental protection,  according to a Thai delegate. He said the year would be  officially inaugurated on January 1, with a wide range of  regional and national activities in each member country.  Promotion campaigns, however, will start this year.    He said most regional activities would be held in the form  of  seminars or workshops while national activities depended on  arrangements of individual countries. There will probably be a  study camp for young people or a trade fair and an exhibition on  green products. It was agreed member countries must achieve set  air and river water quality standards by 2010.    The standard for air in urban and industrialised areas must  be lower than 200 on the Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), one  official said.    The quality standards for river water, were set as follows:  6.0-8.5 for pH, two milligrammes per litre of dissolved oxygen  or more, 10 milligrammes per litre of biochemical oxygen demand  (BOD) or less, and 200 milligrammes per litre of total suspended  solids (TSS) or less.    The officials also discussed a proposal of the Philippine  delegates that Asean adopt its own version of the Basel  Convention which regulates the management and control of  transboundary movement of hazardous wastes.    However, many delegates voiced disagreement with the idea.    "Asean should adhere to the existing convention. Adopting a  new one is time consuming," they said.    One official said he thought the Basel Convention was  comprehensive enough in controlling the export of toxic wastes  from developed to developing countries. "I don't think we need  another version." He said the issue would be further discussed  at a meeting of the working group on the transboundary movement  of hazardous wastes which will be held in Bangkok next year.    Each country, he said, would work out its measures to deal  with the issue before next year's meeting. "In fact, whether  the toxic wastes will be a problem depends on each country's  management and control system. The convention is just a broad  outline," he said.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Hebron Mayor Mustafa al-Natshah by </F> Jack Katzenell; place not given -- live]    [Text] [Katzenell] Let, me ask you this: In view of the  basic and fundamental conclusions of the Shamgar commission that  Goldstein acted alone, they have recommended that new  arrangements for prayers be introduced at the Cave of the  Patriarchs, and no more weapons are to be carried in the area by  soldiers as well, is there any reason why you should not accept  this report?    [Al-Natshah] I said that the report must contain more vital  things, that it did not show that the presence of the settlers  during the past has created the atmosphere which helped  Goldstein to commit the crime. The harassment of the settlers  to the Muslim prayers, and the complaints of a lot of the people  to the police, was not treated in the proper way and was  neglected. The Shamgar did not say about this.    [Katzenell] Mr. al-Natshah, surely this is not the mandate  of the Shamgar commission? It was set up in order to  investigate the massacre of Muslim worshipers in the cave. This  may be true what you are saying about the background to the  tension, but it was not required, this is not what it was asked  to do.    [Al-Natshah] Excuse me, but who committed the crime? It is  not the soldiers, it is the settlers, so you must look at the  atmosphere which was created in the mosque, that this settler  has committed a crime.    [Katzenell] Mr. al-Natshah, then basically, you do not  accept the conclusion that Barukh Goldstein acted alone?    [Al-Natshah] No, I accept that he did it alone, but I said  that the atmosphere which was created by his colleagues, the  settlers, has helped in that he committed the crime.    [Katzenell] And you do not believe that his action was in  fact detached from the atmosphere?    [Al-Natshah] The function was alone, that is okay, but the  atmosphere which was created by the other settlers, I mean the  harassment which occurred days before, has helped him in  committing his crime.</p>

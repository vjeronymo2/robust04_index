The Church also warned that the current presidential system  "sometimes leads" to an uncontrollable growth of the powers of  the head of state in a nine-page document issued by the Synod of  Bishops on the government's plan to reform the nation's  Constitution.    The religious leaders said that "other branches of  government  should be strengthened to obtain a balance and a real division  of powers in the state."    "It is not our intention to propose a reform draft; our  objective was to point out issues that cannot be absent in the  new Constitution," they explained.    The Church confirmed that it had doubts about the way in  which President Carlos Menem and Radical Party Chairman Raul  Alfonsin had agreed on a reform plan through the Olivos Pact.    The bishops group also accepted the dropping of the  Constitution's current requirement that the president be a Roman  Catholic.    However, it underlined that "the cultural identity of the  Argentine nation has unquestionable Roman Catholic roots."    The document specifies that the definition of God included  in  the Constitution as the "source of all reason and justice"  should be maintained in the new charter.    In addition, the Church said that the new law of the land  should include an article similar to the one included in the  Cordoba Constitution stating that "the dignity and moral and  physical integrity of human life from its conception cannot be  violated."

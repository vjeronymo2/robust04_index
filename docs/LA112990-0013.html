			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EQUALITY WATCH;  </P> <P> FOUL PLAY  </P> <P> It was more than mere unsportsmanlike conduct by some clownish football  players. Much worse. And so the most famous football incident of the season so  far has occurred off the field -- in the locker room of the New England  Patriots.  </P> <P> And now NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue has had his say. With his ruling  Tuesday, he put all players, staff, coaches and owners on notice: Women  sportswriters have every right to cover these teams -- and without sexual  harassment.  </P> <P> Tagliabue fined the New England Patriots and three players after an independent  investigation substantiated allegations made by Lisa Olson, a reporter for The  Boston Herald. She was interviewing a player in the locker room when several  teammates sexually harassed her with offensive words and repulsive actions.  Tagliabue levied $25,000 fines against the owner, Victor Kiam, and the team.  </P> <P> He also fined the most active and insulting player, Zeke Mowatt, $12,500. Two  verbal accomplices were each charged $5,000. Those fines -- small change to  athletes who earn an average of $400,000 -- should be a warning of even  stronger penalties for any such future violation.  </P> <P> The commissioner also criticized Kiam and his management for their abysmal  handling of the matter. Kiam initially belittled the incident, dismissing the  allegation of sexual harassment.  </P> <P> All too often that's management's initial reaction when one of the guys  harasses a female colleague. In too many cases, including that football locker  room, nobody tries to stop it.  </P></p>

			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / International Company News: Elkem seeks delay on NKr270m repayment ELKEM, the troubled Norwegian light metals producer, is seeking permission from the industry ministry to delay repayment of a NKr270m (Dollars 46.8m) state loan which is due mid-1993. The loan financed Elkem's acquisition two years ago of a stake in former state-owned Norsk Jern Holding, which controls steel production and distribution companies. The company said yesterday that the request was not prompted by the deepening crisis for Norway's short-term commercial paper market. Elkem's A shares closed 16.7 per cent down at NKr30 and free shares plunged 20 per cent to NKr30 on the news. The company's other loans are being serviced in accordance with stated agreements. Norway's NKr16.5bn short-term commercial paper loan market, called certificates domestically, is suffering from a liquidity squeeze after UNI Storebrand, the country's biggest insurer, last week collapsed into the hands of state administrators when its holding company could not repay an estimated NKr3.6bn in short-term debt. This week, Investa A/S, a Bergen-based investment company, won court protection from creditors after failing to remit on certificate loans of an estimated NKr2.8bn. The certificate market is jittery over NKr4.3bn worth of debt due for payment this month. The central bank yesterday reiterated that it would provide liquidity to loans to companies in situations where their funding deteriorates for reasons not connected directly to them. 'Elkem is not dependent on the certificate market, but has the main bulk of its financing through the bond market, banks and syndicated loan facilities,' it said. The company added that it was not affected by the conditions that caused problems for UNI Storebrand and Investa. State administrators of Uni said yesterday that it was investigating whether NKr358m in short-term loans were illegally secured by the company based on information of its financial situation the week before it collapsed. Elkem said that it had total net interest-bearing debt of an estimated NKr3.9bn. Elkem added that it was seeking to delay repayment of the loan because Norsk Jern had not performed up to expectations. The company is planning further staff reductions at domestic aluminium and ferrosilicon plants, to be announced at the end of this month. Elkem today will also announce plans to reduce domestic ferrosilicon production by 10,000 tonnes out of annual capacity of more than 200,000 tonnes.</p>

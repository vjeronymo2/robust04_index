			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Hong Kong (8): Pressures mount over 1997 - Alain Cass on attitudes among the Hong Kong Chinese HONG KONG is schizoid about 1997. This is hardly surprising. For 150 years it has lived life in the fast lane, conditioned to thinking short-term. Identifying with neither Britain nor China, life for Hong Kong Chinese revolved around the family, the clan and money which they accumulated as if there was no tomorrow. In a sense, there wasn't. If they didn't make it, they just moved on. All that is changing. Hong Kong is now having to come to terms with a future which, for the first time, promises certainty: tomorrow is life as part of the People's Republic of China and people are having to make up their mind where they stand. A recent survey of attitudes to the takeover underlined the paradox of Hong Kong's situation. Most people were deeply gloomy about the future in general. They foresaw a loss of freedom and a fall in their living standards. But asked how they and their families would fare personally they were much more cheerful. Their children would have more opportunities because the elite were leaving in their thousands, thus creating room at the top. South China was taking off economically which meant jobs and business opportunities. Prof. Wong Siulin, who teaches social sciences at Hong Kong University, expresses a different side of this split vision - 'I have always been deeply ambivelant about China,' he says.' On the one hand, I am very suspicious of its leadership. I was shocked by what happened at Tienanmen Square. But it also matters a lot to me to be Chinese. The sense of unity is deeply ingrained, not so much because China is a great power, although that is part of it. It's far more a sense of history, a sense of family.' He still remembers how, during Mao's Great Leap Forward which devastated China, he would go, with his mother, to his local post office in Hong Kong to send food parcels and cooking oil to relatives trapped in Guandong province after the communist take-over. One of his uncles has since built a house - for the two daughters he left behind - for Pounds 6,000, 'out of a sense of guilt I think, as much as anything else.' For Hong and China, read East and West Germany. The dilemma for Hong Kong's Chinese community now is how to reconcile China's emotional pull with the urge to develop a distinct local identity to preserve its cherished freedoms. The events of June 4, 1989 when the communist leadership ruthlessly snuffed out the student revolt in Peking, provided a horrifying glimpse of a possible future. A million people poured on to the streets to protest. Political parties won a big boost as people began to think seriously, many for the first time, about what they stood for and whether they had a future in Hong Kong after 1997. Many concluded they did not - and voted with their feet. The haemorrhage has been running at the rate of 60,000 a year. Mr Chris Patten's arrival has provided a new rallying point. Politics has become more focussed and more vociferous, but the absolute numbers who are actively involved have not grown. Students, if anything, are becoming less political. Student unions are having trouble filling posts. At an individual level, young people have reverted to doing what comes naturally - bettering themselves. Faced with the choice of the ideal and the practical, Hong Kong man will almost invariably choose the latter. Even ardent Patten supporters are inwardly divided. Their heart applauds his eleventh-hour poker game, but their head tells them that, in the long run, it may not make much difference. 'If we don't stand up to them now,' said the chairman of a big local business over dinner,' they'll get away with murder when they take take over  -maybe literally . . . but ultimately,' he concedes, 'Hong Kong cannot confront China. We have to work with them.' Like many others, he and his children have a 'parachute' - a British passport and an overseas bank account. At a deeper level there are few signs of social dislocation, given the uncertainty which the territory faces. Hong Kong society appears remarkably stable. It has a low suicide rate, an enviably low and falling crime rate and a divorce rate which, while rising, remains lower than that in comparable societies. Drugs is not a serious problem in schools, although the Triads, Hong Kong's 'mafia,' are everywhere. Whether it stays that way is largely up to China. If, post-1997, Peking is heavy-handed, or if it tries to dilute Hong Kong's local identity by flooding the place with northerners, as it has done elsewhere on the mainland to secure its grip, then there could be serious social tensions. But if it adopts a cooler approach then an infinitely flexible Hong Kong will merely adapt and learn to work a different system.</p>

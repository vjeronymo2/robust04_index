			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACIAL GAP: LINGERING PROBLEM FOR BLACKS IN AMERICAN SOCIETY  </P> <P> Two articles caught my eye on Jan. 15. One was "Security Guards Seal Off  Anti-Apartheid Students" (Metro). "Thirty high school and junior high school  students spent the second day of a sit-in Saturday at the South African  Consulate in Beverly Hills protesting anti-apartheid policies." One student  stated, "All of us feel strongly that what's going on in South Africa is  unacceptable by any human standards."  </P> <P> Another article on the front page, "Jim Crow's Ghost Lurks in New South,"  stated Atlanta is split almost in half racially. The city's public schools,  with a 92% black student enrollment, are among the most segregated in the  nation. Also economic discrimination is one of the most persistent forms of  anti-black prejudice in the South.  </P> <P> Many other forms of racial discrimination were covered in this excellent  article. I respectfully submit: Let's clean up our own racial discrimination  mess in the U.S. first. After we clean up our own back yard, let us turn out  attention to South Africa's problems.  </P> <P> BYRON DILLON  </P> <P> Downey  </P></p>

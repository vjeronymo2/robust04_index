How is this contradiction to be alleviated? The  Enterprise Management Institute of the Capital Research and  Development Corporation, the Members' Work Department of the  China Enterprise Management Association, and the Capital  Entrepreneurs' Club on the day before yesterday jointly held a  symposium at which this "hot point" issue was explored.    Figures from economic circles attending the symposium said  that the current widespread shortage of funds in state-owned  large and medium-sized enterprises had caused a reappearance of  triangular debts exceeding the scale and rate of those in 1989,  and that the amount of bank savings by enterprises had fallen;  it is now difficult for the enterprises to maintain normal  production and operation. The production and earnings of some  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises that, in the  first half of the year, had been at a moderate rate and had had  fairly good gains, had rapidly fallen back. For example, in the  especially large enterprise Capital Iron and Steel Complex,  which has abundant strength, the corporate debt funds are more  than double what they were in the peak period of 1989. Since the  beginning of this year, banks have given Capital Iron and Steel  Complex 10 million yuan in working capital loans and at the same  time have taken away 77 million yuan; in addition, the market  changes make it impossible to obtain loans paid in advance, and  a serious funds shortage has appeared.    It was widely held by those at the symposium that, from an  analysis of the macroeconomic economy, the fundamental reason  for the current funds shortage was that investment in fixed  assets has increased too sharply and has taken up too many  funds. Last year and this year work was completed on more than  100 billion yuan worth of fixed assets investment projects, and  they required the disposition of auxiliary working capital in a  1:03 ratio, which squeezed the the enterprises' existing working  capital. In addition, the rising prices of the means of  production and raw materials has added to the demand for  enterprise working capital; in the first nine months of this  year, the amount of increase in loans for enterprise working  capital was reduced compared with that in the same period of  last year, and in the August the amount was reduced 10.39  million yuan. The enterprises' nonstandard channels for raising  funds have also been reduced.    Some of those attending the symposium pointed out that the  finance and land management sectors have been overwhelmed by the  "land craze" and the "exploitation craze." This has become a  direct motive force for encouraging an over-rapid momentum for  the increase of investment. For many projects the share system  has been adopted, and the funds paid into them are not taken  back. With these funds not being taken back, the funds that are  taken back are funds that should not be taken out. Thus, in the  state's reorganization of the money market, to a certain extent  contradictions have been shifted to the production domain and  the enterprises.    Speaking of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises  themselves, everybody held that a crucial problem is that  mechanisms to replenish these enterprises' working capital have  not yet been formed. The low rate of growth and the too-heavy  tax burden in several years in succession have caused, on  average, the profits retained by the people in enterprises to be  less than half those retained in 1988, and the capability to  replenish working capital from retained profits to become weaker  and weaker. In line with the stipulation that 1 percent of the  sales income be used to replenish the working capital, the "two  sides" in finance -- pursuing and liquidating -- will deepen the  enterprises' dependence on banks.    With regard to the question of how to alleviate the funds  shortage, the people attending the symposium unanimously  maintained that the fundamental way to do this lies in deepening  reform so as to enhance the vitality of state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises and, at the same time, strengthen the  comprehensiveness of the five major reforms and improve the  enterprises' external environment. Yang Peixin [2799 1014 2450],  a researcher at the Development Research Center of the State  Council, said that, to practically handle the invigoration of  state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises as a central link  in the reform of the entire economic system, the tug-of-war  struggle -- releasing rights-receiving rights-releasing rights  -- is to be avoided. At present there are many ways, with regard  to the funds problem, to handle the release of rights in a  better way, invigorate the enterprises, and cause the  enterprises to reap good returns. Zhu Renxue [2612 0088 1331],  vice chairman of the China Enterprise Management Association,  after giving a briefing on what he saw and heard during an  investigation and study of enterprises over the recent several  months, said that, in strengthening macroeconomic regulation and  control, there remain 20-30 percent of the state-owned large-  and medium-sized enterprises that are maintaining a growth in  production and returns and that they do not feel that their  funds are in very short supply. The operating mechanisms and  management mechanisms of these enterprises are worthy of close  attention and study.    Guo Zhishan [6753 1807 1472], deputy director of the  Enterprise Department in the All-China Federation of Industry  and Commerce, proposed four countermeasures to alleviate the  funds shortage: 1) Concentrate the necessary working capital so  that at any time the difficulties of state-owned large- and  medium-sized enterprises are resolved. Checking the growth of  triangular debts must be made an important objective of macro  regulation and control. 2) Enterprises that have a debt larger  than the average debt of enterprises as a whole must be closed  down, i.e., their production stopped, they are merged, they are  transferred, or they are declared bankrupt. Lawless elements  who, in the name of triangular debts, intentionally erode the  property of state-owned enterprises must be punished. 3) Regular  channels that replenish the enterprises' working capital must be  formed. 4) The growth of investment in fixed assets must be  better controlled, emphasizing that investment in fixed assets  and working capital must form a complete set.    Yang Kaisheng [2799 0418 3932], deputy director of the  Planning Information Department in the Industrial and Commercial  Bank of China, said that, as of the end of September, working  capital loans had increased 63.3 billion yuan compared to their  amount at the beginning of the year, an increase of 4 billion  yuan compared to that of the same period last year. That the  enterprises are not affected by this is mainly because of the  time difference: in July and August bank funds were  comparatively tight, in September the situation changed, and in  September and October there was a fairly big increase in working  capital loans; before long the enterprises will feel the effect  of this. He maintained that not to depend on deepening reform  and adjusting the structure to change the situation in which  enterprise get low returns, and to only increase loans, would be  like "digging up earth to fill a well." Currently the  production and marketing rate is falling, and some of the newly  added working capital loans have become "overstocked goods,"  which shows that we must get a tight grip on the industrial  structure and the product mix. He advocated that short-term  objectives and long-term plans for reform be formulated. Under  the circumstances in which the financial supervision and control  system is not sufficiently perfected, the legal system is not  sound enough, and people do not have a strong enough  understanding of financial risk, in comprehensively blending  funds, direct finance capital should be made primary, but,  speaking of adapting to the market economy's long-term  objectives, we should create conditions for gradually opening up  indirect finance capital.</p>

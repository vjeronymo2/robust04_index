			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Central bank support for yen helps to lift Nikkei INVESTMENT trust buying and Bank of Japan intervention to support the yen lifted the Nikkei average in light pre-holiday trading yesterday, writes Neil Weinberg in Tokyo. The 225-issue index ended 76.88 up at 17,527.40 after a day's low of 17,379.16 and high of 17,606.78. The Topix index of all first section shares rose 6.15 to 1,319.00 and advances outnumbered declines by 564 to 379, with 192 issues unchanged. Volume picked up to 250m shares from Monday's meagre 200m. Tokyo is closed today for a public holiday. In London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index firmed 1.56 to 1,075.59. The market improved late in the session on the central bank's moves to strengthen the yen after the weekend meeting of Group of Seven nations ended with calls for a stronger Japanese currency. Investment trusts set up this week to funnel corporate funds back into the stock market also offered some support, although the amounts collected came in well below target. The trusts are among Finance Ministry measures to bolster the market and could lead to a lifting of the ban on corporate share repurchases. Mr Jason Fames of James Capel Pacific said there was talk of a two-tier market emerging, in which leading electricals and other manufacturing issues continued to do well while bank shares languished. 'The question is whether industrial stocks can go up faster than others fall,' he added. 'Right now the market is at a balancing point, waiting for the economy to recover or the Bank of Japan to ease interest rates, but I do not think that is about to happen.' Speculative and incentive-backed issues fared well, with Morinaga Milk, the market volume leader, gaining Y20 to Y791 and Teac Y10 to Y1,030. NTT moved up Y8,000 to Y636,000 amid local reports that the minimum trading unit of Tokyo's most expensive issue might be reduced. The yen's strength prompted investors to buy into blue chip issues, which have fared well in recent sessions. Sony put on Y20 to Y4,330 and Toyota Motor Y10 to Y1,460. The department stores sector continued to decline on weak earnings and sales prospects. Mitsukoshi fell Y19 to register a year's low of Y801. Bank issues traded mixed amid further evidence that their recent rally had ended. Dai-Ichi Kangyo rose Y60 to Y1,380 while Mitsubishi Bank was off Y30 to Y1,770. Most other financials were lower, with Nikko Securities down Y21 at Y623 and Tokio Fire and Marine off Y3 at Y995. Signs of continued weakness in the Japanese economy appeared after the market's close with the release of March industrial production figures. They showed a 2.8 per cent fall from February, compared to a forecast of a 0.9 per cent decline. Roundup THE PACIFIC Rim was mixed yesterday, with the spotlight remaining on Hong Kong. It has risen 11 per cent over the last eight sessions. HONG KONG advanced strongly after news that Lloyds Bank, of the UK, was considering a bid against HSBC's agreed takeover of Midland Bank. HSBC climbed HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 42.75. The Hang Seng index gained a net 51.62 at 5,423.39 after earlier attaining an all-time high of 5,442.90. Turnover reached HKDollars 3.67bn, against HKDollars 3.16bn. SINGAPORE rose on bargain hunting. The Straits Times Industrial index finished 13.53 ahead at 1,426.64 in turnover of SDollars 85.7m. SEOUL retreated on profit-taking. The composite index closed 10.82 off at 597.24 in turnover of Won394.8bn. Manufacturing, securities, bank and construction stocks posted the biggest losses. AUSTRALIA closed slightly higher before today's CPI figures for March. The All Ordinaries index rose 2.9 to 1,605.8 in turnover of ADollars 179.2m. Forecasts for annual inflation range between 1.9 to 2.3 per cent and analysts expect a cut in interest rates later this week. NEW ZEALAND lost ground, the NZSE-40 index slipping 6.82 to 1,447.15. BOMBAY plummeted on speculative selling as trading resumed after a week-long boycott by traders. The BSE index lost 570.42, or 12.8 per cent, to 3,896.90. TAIWAN advanced in active trade, the weighted index adding 37.50 at 4,523.95 in turnover of TDollars 24.3bn. MANILA moved ahead, led by a strong performance by Philippine Long Distance Telephone. The composite index rose 20.61 to 1,211.48 in combined turnover of 190.29m pesos. PLDT climbed 25 pesos to 930 pesos. KUALA LUMPUR was featureless. The composite index regained 2.60 to 583.62 in turnover of MDollars 62.9m. BANGKOK's SET index fell 6.41 to 768.11.</p>

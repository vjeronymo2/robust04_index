			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Yeltsin heads for showdown with congress THE first shots in the post-referendum confrontation between the president and parliament in Russia were fired yesterday as President Boris Yeltsin's closest aides and ministers demanded immediate action on a new constitution and economic reforms. At the same time parliament cancelled a presidential decree keeping in office a pro-Yeltsin republican leader who had been fired by his conservative parliament. The parliament voted to annul the decree signed this month by Mr Yeltsin which restored in office Mr Vasily Guslyannikov, the president of the small autonomous republic of Mordovia who had been removed by an order of his Supreme Soviet. The deputies voted under article 109 of the constitution, recently introduced by them, which enable them to abolish all presidential decrees pending an appeal to the Constitutional Court. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, the deputy prime minister and a key aide to Mr Yeltsin during his referendum campaign, said that Mr Boris Yeltsin should take the following steps in the days and weeks ahead: Consult with leaders of the regions and the republics on a draft constitution and a law on elections: on agreement, he would present them to the parliament and invite approval. Following a likely refusal, decree a new constitution which would replace the current Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies with a bicameral parliament, and further decree elections to these in the autumn. Mr Shakhrai said Mr Yeltsin would meet regional and republican leaders tomorrow. Mr Yeltsin's tactic, according to Mr Shakhrai, would be to proceed swiftly but without 'major blunders' to fulfil the mandate given by the voters in bringing in constitutional and economic reform. Mr Shakhrai, introducing the draft constitution, said that it laid the basis for a 'presidential republic ..with some of the values of a parliamentary system.' Mr Sergei Alexeyev, an expert on constitutional law who has helped prepare the constitution, said it was the blueprint for a truly federal state which would forestall the tendencies towards disintegration. One such tendency showed itself yesterday with the announcement that citizens of St Petersburg, Russia's second city, had voted to turn their city into an autonomous republic.</p>

Consistently advocating the creation  of a common economic zone, the governments believe that the  implementation of agreements reached within the framework of the  CIS -- providing for the strengthening of direct ties between  economic entities on the basis of the free movement of goods,  services, capital, and labor as well as coordinated financial,  monetary- credit, price, convertible currency, and customs  policies -- can be accelerated by expanding bilateral  cooperation.    The Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation have  similar economic systems, common borders, and historically  similar national fates. Reflecting the drive for economic  integration voiced by the citizens of their states, the  governments have taken a number of measures aimed at further  expanding this cooperation without damaging national sovereignty.    The implementation of the agreement on unifying the monetary  systems of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian Federation  will become the decisive factor for strengthening economic ties  between Belarus and Russia. The agreement stipulates conducting  coordinated monetary-credit, budget, convertible currency,  taxation, and social policies, as well as the creation of a  common customs zone with a common system of prices.    The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Belarus point out that coordinated measures were carried out  between September and December 1993, in accordance with the  agreement on the unification of the monetary systems, and it was  concluded that these systems have been brought to a high state  of readiness.    The leaders of the Russian Federation and the Republic of  Belarus declare that preparations for the final unification of  the monetary systems has been completed.    The governments have charged appropriate ministries and  departments with drafting agreements determining the mechanism  for the functioning of the Belarusian monetary system after the  unification of the systems, as well as a common mechanism for  managing the budgets of the two states and documents determining  foreign economic, trade, and customs policies. Technical  aspects necessary for the functioning of the unified system  should also be discussed, so as to sign the documents on forming  a bilateral economic union within the framework of the CIS in  Minsk in January 1994.    The Governments of the Republic of Belarus and the Russian  Federation believe that the unification of the two states'  monetary systems will serve the cause of safeguarding the two  nations' economic progress and improving mechanisms for  cooperation within the framework of the CIS.

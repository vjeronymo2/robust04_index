			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Greek Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias and </F> Lord David Owen following talks in the Greek Foreign Ministry in  Athens -- live]    [Text] [Papoulias] First, our talks have not concluded. We  will continue with a working dinner, and will probably remain in  contact with you to brief you on what will be discussed over  dinner.    At the invitation of the Greek Presidency of the European  Union, we welcome Lord Owen and Thorvald Stoltenberg to Athens.  We also welcome Ambassador (Marsais) and Messrs. (Landlow),  (Ramsarand), (Sabenoir) and (Dan) from the European Commission.  The subject of our talks is known; it is the crisis in  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We exchanged views, we briefed each other  on the latest developments and the ongoing effort by the  cochairmen [of the Geneva conference on the former Yugoslavia]  and the Greek Presidency of the European Union. You know things  are difficult. We are trying to do something better than has  been done. We always hope. We hope the Geneva talks will be  positive. The Greek Presidency will make every effort to  achieve a positive outcome in Geneva, doing as much as it can to  influence things with the interested parties. You also know  that today we begin what is the first chapter in the efforts of  the Greek Presidency toward achieving an immediate cease-fire in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and promoting the Franco-German plan we have  accepted in the European Union, enforced as I said with the  thoughts and views of the Greek Presidency, especially as Greece  is a Balkan country. Thank you very much, now I turn the podium  over to Lord Owen.    [Owen, in English followed by Greek translation at the end  of  his remarks] Mr. Foreign Minister, first of all, Mr. Stoltenberg  and I thank you very much indeed for your hospitality. As you  say, the meeting will continue but it is very important at this  early stage in the Greek Presidency that both of us should  exchange views with you. As you say, as a Balkan state, you  contribute to the European Union from the depth of knowledge and  of your proximity to this tragic situation. There is no doubt  that the neighbors to the former Yugoslavia are paying a very  heavy price, not just financially but in many other respects for  the continued fight and the destruction that this is causing in  the region. Therefore, we must profoundly hope that we can make  a comprehensive peace settlement and we certainly approach the  talks in Geneva with that intent, that one has to say that if  the public statements of the parties are to be believed, then  the prospects are not very good. But let us hope that those are  statements for the morale of the fighting forces and that when  it comes to the actual negotiations, the parties will seek the  difficult compromises which can alone achieve a peace settlement.</p>

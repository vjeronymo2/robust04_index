			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo American tops exploration league RTZ CORPORATION of the UK may claim to be the world's biggest mining group but its exploration expenditure last year fell below that of its main rival, the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. According to a survey by the Metals Economics Group of Canada, RTZ expected to spend USDollars 100m on grassroots exploration in 1991 whereas Anglo budgeted Dollars 102m. When associated companies are taken into account, the RTZ group budget was Dollars 200m compared with Anglo's Dollars 221m. The Anglo spending includes Dollars 60m by its De Beers diamond associate, Dollars 22m by Minorco, its overseas investment arm, and Dollars 12m by Gold Fields of South Africa, which MEG includes because of Anglo's 25.9 per cent shareholding in GFSA. Nine companies are listed in the RTZ group, including CRA of Australia, which budgeted Dollars 86m exploration spending for last year. Other big exploration spenders last year included Canada's Noranda, with a budgeted Falconbridge) and the 11 companies knit into the combine comprised of MIM, Asarco, Cominco, Teck and Metallgesellschaft,which between them expected to spend Dollars 125m. Placer Dome budgeted to spend Dollars 60m, as did the Anglovaal group. BHP was scheduled to spend Dollars 54m on non-ferrous metals exploration, Newmont Mining Dollars 50m and Western Mining Dollars 44m. MEG says the Hanson conglomerate's US gold subsidiary, Gold Fields Mining Corporation, expected to maintain its exploration budget at Dollars 17m. The survey covered 153 mining companies with annual exploration budgets of more than Dollars 1m. MEG estimates these accounted for 80 per cent of all worldwide spending on non-ferrous metals exploration (the survey excludes iron ore, bauxite, coal or oil and gas exploration). It says there was an 8 per cent fall in expenditure by the companies surveyed compared with 1990. Of the Dollars 1.8bn total, Dollars 430m was directed to projects in Canada, Dollars 353m to Australia and Dollars 341m to the US. MEG points out that, although it is still attracting most spending, Canada's exploration level has fallen sharply from 1987 and 1988 when favourable tax treatment for investors boosted spending to more than Dollars 1bn in each year. US expenditures have remained relatively stable but Australian spending has fallen steadily since 1987. Rough estimates put spending in South Africa at Dollars 245m, in South America at Dollars 200m, the south Pacific region at Dollars 125m, Europe at Dollars 80m and Africa outside South Africa at Dollars 70m. Gold exploration attracted more than Dollars 1bn or 56 per cent of total spending while base metals exploration, having recovered from the depressed levels of the mid-1980s, accounted for 31 per cent. MEG says: 'Many of the major companies have kept up a relatively constant base metals exploration effort from year to year, but smaller companies are now joining in as the low gold price continues to dampen investor interest in gold.

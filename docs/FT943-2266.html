			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / International Capital Markets: Pension schemes in UK 'set to cut equities holdings' UK pension schemes are likely to reduce their very significant holdings in equities in coming years, while European pension schemes, typically large bond investors, are likely to increase theirs, panelists at a pension fund investment seminar concluded. The debate about equity investment by UK pension schemes has been heightened by proposed new minimum solvency rules which actuaries warn will force them to shift some of their assets into fixed-interest. Also, many large schemes now have more current and deferred pensioners than they do contributing members, a condition which actuaries say requires them to switch into bonds in order to ensure they have sufficient cash flow to meet payments as they fall due. Meanwhile, pension investment experts are warning Continental pension schemes that unless they increase equity investment, corporations will have to increase pension scheme contributions in order to pay promised benefits. Speaking at a National Association of Pension Funds conference in London last Friday, Mr Jean Frijns, board director responsible for investment at Dutch pension scheme ABP, said that the national peculiarities which have led European pension schemes to favour bonds heavily are likely to disappear as markets become internationalised. 'The internationalisation and integration of capital markets challenges national common wisdom and enables pension funds to operate on larger and more liquid markets,' he said. The factor of peer group behaviour, which often discourages European fund managers from increasing their equity weightings, should become less important as trustees begin to measure each manager's performance against a wider group. Meanwhile, Mr Tim Gardener, partner at consulting actuaries William M. Mercer, predicted that due to new pension scheme rules and an ageing membership roster, 'UK pension scheme equity rations will converge towards the European average'. In three years time, he said, the current 85 per cent average weighting in equities will be 75 per cent and falling. 'I see perhaps Pounds 40bn going into bonds. Hopefully, the Europeans will be converging towards us and be buying those equities,' he said. ABP, the Netherlands' largest pension scheme and a big institutional investor in the Dutch market, has been fighting to ease government restrictions on its asset allocation for years. From January 1996 no restrictions will apply and Mr Frijns said the scheme will seek to increase its holdings of equities. In explaining the propensity of European fund managers to invest in bonds, Mr Frijns cites different attitudes towards risk, differences in the institutional environment and differences in 'the collective learning curve'. The habit of UK actuaries to use a so-called actuarial valuation for equities, which smoothes fluctuations in market value, added to the comfort level afforded fund managers investing in them. By contrast, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany all use market value as the valuation basis.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Communist Party of the Philippines [CPP] has  put out an arrest order for breakaway leader Felimon Lagman and  has fielded an armed unit of the New People's Army [NPA] to take  him into custody.    But Lagman, in a telephone interview with the INQUIRER, said  his men are ready to kill believed CPP head Jose Ma. Sison in  Utrecht, The Netherlands, if the party pushes through with its  arrest order against him.    "Come and get me," Lagman said. "Our answer to that is tit  for tat. Once they formalize the decision to arrest or execute  me, automatically we will hit Sison in Utrecht.    "We will not retaliate against any of Sison's men in the  Philippines. We will hit the head itself in The Netherlands."    In a press statement, the provisional executive committee of  the Manila-Rizal branch of the CPP said the party has decided to  place Lagman on trial for various crimes against "the working  class, the people, and the revolution."    The statement described Lagman as a "traitor to the  revolution."    A source in the committee said a team of armed partisans is  now hunting Lagman, who broke off from Sison's leadership last  year.    Lagman has blamed Sison's leadership for the setbacks  suffered by the communist movement, including its failure to  seize the chance to grab power during the EDSA [Epifanio of the  Saints Avenue] uprising of 1986.    "The revolutionary proletariat rejoices at the decision of  the party to put to trial the traitors to the revolution,  particularly Felimon Lagman who was responsible for the  near-fatal annihilation of the labor movement in Metro Manila,"  said the statement.    It was signed by one Nova Salvacion, presumably a pseudonym.    Salvacion said once arrested, Lagman will be immediately  tried by a people's court where evidence of his alleged crimes  will be presented.    "Metro Manila-Rizal proletarian revolutionaries shall  furnish  the people's court the litany of crimes committed by Lagman and  his clique, and the evidence on hand proving the guilt of those  heinous offenses," the statement said.    "(These) revolutionaries shall be eagerly waiting for the  outcome of their trial," it added.    The CPP's arrest order for Lagman came weeks after the  killing of Leopoldo "Ka [Comrade] Hector" Mabilangan, one of the  former leaders of the NPA's Banahaw Command operating in  Southern Tagalog.    Mabilangan had earlier surrendered to the government and  received a P5 [Philippine pesos] million loan for a cooperative  he was starting in Sto. [Santo -- Holy] Tomas, Batangas, his  hometown.    The command, through its spokesperson Rogelio "Ka Roger"  Rosal, has claimed responsibility for the killing of Mabilangan  in a churchyard in Sto. Tomas.    In a statement read over radio station DZRH, Rosal said  Mabilangan had been executed for various crimes against the  party and the revolutionary underground, including the abduction  and killing of fellow rebels.    The killing of Mabilangan deepened the rift between opposing  factions in the CPP.    During Labor Day rallies yesterday, the rift was highlighted  by the holding of separate rallies by groups loyal to Sison and  those who have broken off from his leadership.    The pro-Sison group held its rally at the Liwasang Bonifacio  while members of the breakaway group, which had allied with the  Trade Union Congress of the Philippines, converged at the Luneta  Grandstand.    Sison, in an earlier telephone interview with station DZMM  from his base in Utrecht, said Lagman, former NPA leader Romulo  Kintanar, former CPP-Visayas leader Arturo Tabara, and several  other breakaway rebel leaders had been plotting to assassinate  him in collaboration with the military.    Lt. Gen. Arturo Enrile, AFP [Armed Forces of the  Philippines]  chief, as well as Lagman and Tabara, has denied Sison's charge.    Sison's allies in The Netherlands have asked their local  comrades to investigate the alleged assassination plot against  him.</p>

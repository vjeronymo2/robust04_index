			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Row brews over spoils in Community chest THE EC Council of Ministers meets today to decide how to spend the Ecu141.5bn (Pounds 109.4bn) structural aid programme agreed at last December's Edinburgh summit, with clear signs of a row brewing over how to divide up the pie among the 12. The bulk of the money, available for 1994-99, is aimed at the four poorest countries - Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece - which also get Ecu15.5bn through the Cohesion Fund. But the European Commission has sought to target as much as possible of the so-called Structural Funds on declining and high unemployment industrial areas, raising the stakes for the richer member states as well. Of the 12 as a whole, only tiny, and very rich Luxembourg is happy with the way the spending plans are shaping up. The job of today's, probably lengthy meeting, attended by a mix of foreign, industry, and regional affairs ministers, is to approve a framework regulation for the spending, and the enabling rules for each division of the Structural Funds. Already several countries are baulking at giving their assent before knowing how much they are going to get. Although approval is needed by the end of this month in order to start the programme in 1994, there are already 53 declarations from member states attached to the Commission's plans. The total Ecu157bn regional development package replaces the Ecu63bn spending for 1989-93. The four 'Cohesion' countries essentially won their battle last year, getting a doubling of their funding for the six-year period, against the previous five-year period. Apart from the Cohesion Fund, they get Ecu70bn of the Ecu96.3bn devoted to so-called Objective 1, or backward areas. But Ireland says it will block agreement unless it gets undertakings it will preserve the share of Objective 1 funding it got in the previous round. This gave the Irish two to two-and-a-half times more funds per head than the other Cohesion countries. Mr Albert Reynolds, Irish prime minister, fought last year's Maastricht referendum on a pledge to get IPounds 8bn (Pounds 8bn) from the package, which he said he secured at Edinburgh. One senior Commission official says 'there is no way they are going to get what Reynolds said,' which officials from other member states say was an irresponsible claim. The Netherlands, a relatively small recipient, wants up to three times more to reflect a relative decline in national wealth and growing unemployment. Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, told Commission president Jacques Delors on Tuesday that Holland would only back an agreement if it got a guarantee, Commission and Dutch officials say. Though other countries have been less aggressive, they all have shopping lists: the UK wants, and will probably get, Merseyside and the Scottish Highlands and Islands made Objective 1 areas. But it flatly opposes changes in the Social Fund - hitherto for training the long-term and young unemployed - to pay for retraining workers in companies facing restructuring, which one British official described as 'a closet industrial policy.' Belgium will probably get the declining southern industrial area of Hainaut eligible for Objective 1 funding. France objects that neighbouring Nord-Pas de Calais suffers identical problems. But Paris will probably desist, to protect Corsica, whose rise in income above the eligibility level is what lets Hainaut and Merseyside into Objective 1. Germany is after at least DM13bn (Pounds 5.1bn) for its eastern Lander. In addition, the Germans, British and French, want the right to designate Objective 2, or industrially declining regions, a right Mr Delors refuses to cede. THE European Commission has broadly welcomed the application of Malta and Cyprus to join the EC, but delayed a firm commitment on the timing of entry, writes Lionel Barber. The Commission's response may disappoint Malta, but it reflects concern that further EC enlargement requires tackling the sensitive issue of how to streamline the operations of the EC while safeguarding the position of smaller states. The cause of Cyprus remains clouded by the failure to reach a political settlement between the Greeks and Turks. But the Commission says it may reconsider its views in January 1995 even if part of the island remains under Turkish occupation. Until now, the EC has insisted that a full political settlement in Cyprus, including reunification, is a pre-condition for the start of accession negotiations. This week's statement appears aimed at pressuring the parties to support a UN-brokered settlement. Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible for enlargement, said last Wednesday that the Commission was ready to help preparations toward entry. But the timing would depend on decisions on institutional reform to be considered at the inter-governmental conference to review the Maastricht treaty in 1996. Malta and Cyprus applied for EC membership in 1990. The Commission's opinion on the application says their aspirations are justified and there no serious obstacles. However, it calls on Malta to carry out an overhaul of economic regulations as the best preparation for membership.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> NEW JERSEY;  </P> <P> WATERWAY REOPENED FOLLOWING OIL SPILL  </P> <P> The Coast Guard reopened the Kill Van Kull waterway between Bayonne, N. J., and  Staten Island, N. Y. Coast Guard spokesman Jim McGranachan said ships using the  waterway have been ordered to keep their speeds low enough to avoid creating  wakes that would interfere with crews bagging more than 260,000 gallons of the  gooey No. 6 heating oil dumped when the British tanker BT Nautilus ran aground  last week. The cleanup is expected to last at least eight more weeks.  </P></p>

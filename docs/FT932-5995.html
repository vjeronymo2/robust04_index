			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Retail sales set to confirm 'brittle' upturn RETAIL SALES figures for May are likely to show a rise and 'there is no doubt that a recovery is under way', according to a survey of purchasing intentions published today. But economic recovery is still 'brittle and gradual', says the report by Verdict Research, the economic research group. The Verdict report for April accurately anticipated the slump shown by the that month's retail spending figures. That was the first month-on-month decline this year, exposing the fragility of the recovery. However, Verdict says in the past year 'there is a reasonably clear trend' of improvement in spending plans, which have 'picked up markedly in the past three months'. The monthly survey of 2,000 consumers' spending plans for the next six months shows that more intend to buy a car, electrical appliances and men's clothes than was the case in April. However, it warns that 'consumers' attitudes to buying cars have tended to be a little volatile'. Plans for house buying have been steady for four months, it says. The increases in spending intentions were particularly marked in the north and south of the country, but spending plans in the Midlands were reined back. Almost all of last month's increase came from 35-to-54-year-olds. The official May retail sales figures will be released within the next three weeks. Looking further ahead, a separate report by Staniland Hall Associates, the economic forecasters, warns that consumer spending will rise by less in 1994 than in 1993. It saysthe rise in constant prices will be about 2 per cent this year but only 1.3 per cent next year. The report supports the Verdict survey's findings that consumer confidence rose in May, and that householders' intentions to move are broadly steady. But the intensifying squeeze on pay, the prospect of a rise in inflation and the tax increases that will take effect in 1994 will cause spending to flatten out in the second half of this year, the Staniland Hall survey says.</p>

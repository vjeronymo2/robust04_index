			<p>940707 FT  07 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Finnish money supply rises Improved liquidity among companies was an important factor behind the rapid rise in Finland's M1 and M3 money aggregates, a central bank official said yesterday. This reflected better profitability and a return to profit by many companies last year. On the other hand, bank deposits in the household sector had grown much less. M1 rose 11.8 per cent year-on-year in May after a rise of 11 per cent in April, while M3 rose 10.1 per cent after rising 8.9 per cent in April. State debt rose to FM289.1bn (Pounds 35.3bn) in June, up FM13.3bn from May. The cost of living in Poland has grown by 12.5 per cent since the beginning of the year, more slowly than in the first half last year when prices rose 16 per cent. Average prices in June were up by 32.5 per cent on the same month in 1993.</p>

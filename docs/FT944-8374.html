			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / (CORRECTED) International Company News: Pioneer slips into red at halftime Correction (published 29th November 1994) appended to this article. Declining revenue from sales of karaoke equipment is calling the tune at Pioneer, the Japanese manufacturer of specialist audio-visual electronics. The company made a net loss in the six months to September, and indicated that some 1,300 jobs may have to go during the next five years. A strong yen and falling prices in the consumer electronics market, and lower demand for karaoke equipment, combined to help push Pioneer to a consolidated net loss of Y761m (Dollars 7.8m) in the first half, compared with a profit of Y7.7bn at the same stage a year ago. Revenues slipped to Y129.2bn from Y130.9bn previously. Recurring profits - before extraordinary items and tax - fell to Y3.7bn from Y7.9bn, although last year's figure included an exceptional gain. It plans to focus on car navigation and audio systems which are expected to be more promising than karaoke and laser disc systems. Japan Tobacco, the Japanese cigarette monopoly, posted a rise in interim earnings thanks to declines in raw material costs, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The company, listed on the country's leading stock exchanges last month, said recurring profits for the first six months to September rose 7.7 per cent to Y66.9bn as a result of a fall in tobacco leaf costs due to the higher yen. The company increased the amount of imported tobacco leaves since the domestic product costs three times as much. Sales fell 0.5 per cent to Y1,372.4bn. The company lost 1.6 points of its share in the domestic market to foreign cigarette makers while the overall market only grew 0.6 per cent. After-tax profits rose 3.1 per cent to Y41.4bn. CORRECTION In a recent report of Pioneer's interim results it was incorrectly stated that the company's consolidated sales were down to Y129bn from Y130.9bn. This should have read down to Y245.6bn from Y255.5bn.</p>

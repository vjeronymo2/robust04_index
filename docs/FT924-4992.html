			<p>921128 FT  28 NOV 92 / Christmas Food and Drink: Burgundy, good but not great - Edmund Penning-Rowsell assesses the merits of an early vintage and finds that prices are falling AFTER AN early vine flowering and a warm summer, including a very hot August, Burgundy this year had the most successful vintage of any French wine region. The vintage began in mid-September, a fortnight earlier than usual, and before that in the Maconnais. A heavy day's rain on the 22nd caused little dilution of grapes that were very ripe. Alcoholic degrees were high and the red wines have very good colour and plenty of fruit. They and the whites are rather low in acidity and probably will develop fairly quickly - or that was the view of the oenologist of the Hospices de Beaune wines. In the Cote d'Or, the crop was at least a good average, but it was large in Chablis - indeed, it was described as outstanding. To generalise early on about the quality of a vintage in the Cote d'Or and Chalonnaise is very difficult because of the way the vineyards are parcelled up and the deep divisions in ownership. In the Cote d'Or this year a good deal depended on the growers' and merchants' views on the necessity or otherwise of summer pruning: a recent practice in Burgundy, imported largely from Bordeaux. Robert Drouhin, head of one of the most distinguished Beaune negociant houses, which also owns or manages vineyards, said that quality this year depends on grape thinning, as did Louis Latour - although Claude Bouchard, chief of Bouchard Pere et Fils, the biggest vineyard owners in the Cote, declared it unnecessary. Louis Latour's company thinned vigorously this year, but nevertheless made a third more Corton Charlemagne than usual, compared with a normal 150 casks. Thinning is an expensive, expert operation and another view is that it is better to prune more severely earlier in the year before the budding. It is generally agreed that 1992 will be accepted as a good vintage - good, but not outstanding such as 1989 and 1990. Marginally the whites may be superior to the reds; but it all depends how both were made. Those who restricted their yields certainly produced the best wine. The market has not yet opened; the recession and excessive unsold stocks in growers' and merchants' cellar mean that it may not do so until at least the spring, so it is premature to quote prices. However, if results of the recent Hospices de Beaune's auction of sales of its new wines are any guide, they will certainly be down. From their 1989 peak, the Hospices' prices fell for the third year running at auction. The average price of the 567 casks of the red cuvees was Ffr17,243 (Pounds 2,113); that of the 96 casks of white was Ffr21,625. Prices would certainly have been lower still but for the frequent intervention of Andre Boisseau of Patriarche Pere et Fils, who maintained his traditional support by buying 250 casks of the 663 sold: nearly 40 per cent of the total. Prices were also influenced by the threatened Gatt trade war. The US normally takes 25 per cent of all white burgundies exported but, significantly, there was not one US purchase at the auction. It was a Japanese company that bought the first lot - 10 casks of Pommard Cuvee Raymond Cyrot - for Ffr60,000 a cask, though the second lot went for only Ffr15,000. Although 110 more casks were auctioned this year the sale total of Ffr11,853m compared with Ffr12,852m last year: the lowest since the small crop of 1981. Such steep falls will not be reflected in the Burgundy trade, which is active at the regional and lesser appellations level. But in the Grand Crus (Chambertin, Musigny, Montrachet, etc) and Premiers Crus (leading Nuits-St Georges, Pommards and Volnays), business is very difficult, and for these a drop of 10 to 15 per cent may be expected on the 1991 prices, though the 1992s are finer. At the end of the campaign year in August, growers' unsold red and wine stocks were at record levels. They face not only cash-shortage problems: with their 1991s largely unsold they have no room for two crops. Unless the economic difficulties deepen, the first 1992s - mostly whites - are unlikely to be on Burgundy shippers' lists until next autumn, and on growers' until they have bottled their wines in 1994. Meanwhile, until the more attractive of the variable 1991s can be selected by those merchants in the UK that specialise in burgundy, the best buys for the consumer are the 1990s, in both colours.</p>

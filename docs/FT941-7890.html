			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Japan pulled 'by economic tug of war' Japan's economy is locked in a 'tug of war' between forces of growth and decline, Mr Yasushi Mieno, governor of the central bank, said yesterday. Positive factors, such as record low interest rates and the government's latest economic pump-priming package, were finely balanced against the constraints of continuing job reductions, the restructuring of banks' balance sheets and the recent 'excessive' strength of the yen, he said. But a gloomy report from the government's Economic Planning Agency yesterday is likely to increase pressure on the Bank of Japan for another cut in its official discount rate, from 1.75 per cent, at which it has stood for six months. The EPA's index of leading indicators, a pointer to business conditions in the next few months, fell to 36.4 per cent in December, the eighth month running for which this index has stood below the 50 per cent dividing line between growth and decline, compared with 41.7 per cent recorded in November. The index's components show conflicting trends, illustrating Mr Mieno's economic tug of war. Construction starts continued a three-month rising trend, as did business confidence among small and medium companies. New job offers rose in December for the second month running, while commodity prices picked up for the first time in 10 months. On the negative side, money supply was weak, sales of consumer durables fell for the third month running, and department store sales continued a 22-month decline. The EPA's coincident index, a barometer of present conditions, fell to 25 per cent in December, the third month in which it stood below 50 per cent. If the Bank of Japan continues to follow its usual caution on interest changes, it is likely to defer any decision until after the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting next weekend and after the publication of its own Tankan quarterly survey of business confidence, Japan's most authoritative indicator of the short-term outlook, early next month. Separately, Japan's car makers continued to trim production in line with weak demand last month, when vehicle output fell 13.5 per cent from January 1993, the 16th consecutive monthly fall, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Association said.</p>

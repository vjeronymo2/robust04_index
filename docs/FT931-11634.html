			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / BT presses EC on competition BRITISH Telecommunications is urging the European Commission to open the European telecoms market to free competition, arguing that monopolies are a dangerous anachronism in modern markets. It wants the commission to issue a directive that would force liberalisation on EC members by January 1 1995. The consent of national governments would not be necessary. BT's views appear in a submission made as part of a commission review of telecommunications policy.</p>

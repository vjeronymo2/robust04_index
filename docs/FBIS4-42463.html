			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Italy, Germany To Serve Two Years </F> on Security Council"]    [Text] (ANSA) New York, June 1 -- Italy and Germany have  been put forward by the Western nations to take over, January 1,  from New Zealand and Spain for a two-year stint among the UN  Security Council's 10 nonpermanent members, an Italian spokesman  confirmed here this morning. The candidacy was made after the  withdrawal of Ireland, Greece, and Sweden, which said it will be  seeking the job for 1997-98.    The appointment is expected to be approved by the UN General  Assembly in October.    The Security Council has five permanent members -- the  United  States, Russia, China, Britain and France -- and 10 nonpermanent  members rotating every two years.    Italy and Germany are among the countries which have  repeatedly requested an enlargement of the Council.</p>

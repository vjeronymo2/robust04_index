In his speech during the session of the  Dniester Supreme Soviet, Smirnov said that Moldova owed Tiraspol  30 billion rubles for electricity supplied from Dniester. At  the same time, the fees for licenses for external economic  activity of the Dniester enterprises are transferred into  Moldova's budget. The Dniester authorities intend to compel the  enterprises in the Dniester Republic to register again. Now all  taxes for licenses and other payments will be transferred in the  budget of the self- proclaimed republic. According to Smirnov,  the Dniester enterprises have transferred in Moldova's budget  for the obtained licenses 85 billion rubles. Igor Smirnov also  established by a decree customs duty for transiting goods on  Dniester territory. According to that decree, for every truck  with a cargo a $30 transit tax will be paid. The decree does not  refer to transport means belonging to Russia, Ukraine, and  Belarus.</p>

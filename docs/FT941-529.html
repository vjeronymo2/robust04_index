			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Romania approves tax on land The Romanian parliament yesterday approved a law introducing a tax on land ownership, which the Propact farmers' union said would create social unrest. Although most agricultural land is now worked by private farmers, only 15 per cent of the 5.1m private landowners have received full titles to property returned under a 1991 act. This has prevented them from using their land as collateral to raise capital for seeds and equipment. Opposition MPs, who boycotted the vote on the law, said the tax was illegal and that they intended to appeal to the constitutional court. They said tax could be levied on production but not on estimates of production from a piece of land, as provided in the law. The tax was a way of discriminating against private individual landowners, they said. Agriculture companies, such as state farms, will continue to pay tax on profits rather than the new tax. Passage of the law clears the way for presentation of the much-delayed 1994 budget and for International Monetary Fund approval of a Dollars 700m loan package.</p>

			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Stronger dollar seen ECONOMISTS and foreign exchange dealers are expecting the US dollar to confirm its recent strength if key economic data due on Thursday comes in as forecast, writes Peter John. US data has been slightly more positive for the economy following the recent disappointing non-farm payroll figures and many hope that the figures for third quarter US gross domestic product will consolidate that improvement. Mr Jonathan Hoffman, economist with Credit Suisse First Boston said the figure would be skewed by the impact of the heavy floods around the Mississippi so the headline figure should be adjusted up to get a true picture. The market is looking for a rise over the past quarter of 2.7 per cent. 'The dollar is on a bull run at the moment and if we get an good underlying figure per cent we could go through DM1.70 this week,' says Mr Hoffman. A rise in the US currency is likely to be particularly noticeable against the German currency as the foreign exchange community scents further interest rate reductions by the Bundesbank following last Thursday's cuts in the discount and Lombard rates. Additional impetus for lower lending levels, at least for the repo rate, could come from the German CPI data due this week. A shift below 4 per cent in the annual rate to between 3.8 per cent and 3.7 per cent, may well show the way to a another cut. In the UK, market pressure for a one-point cut in base rates could continue as a spate of reductions in continental Europe at the end of last week suggested that the current UK level might be unnecessarily solid. Economists will be looking at the CBI's survey of industrial trends tomorrow for any clues to easier monetary policy.</p>

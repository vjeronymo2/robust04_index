			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  instructed Thursday [7 April] a Unification and Security Policy  Coordination Council be formed comprising National Unification  Board [NUB], foreign, and defense ministers, National Security  Planning agency director, chief presidential secretary, and  senior secretary for foreign and national security affairs to  effectively and consistently cope with the North Korean nuclear  issue.    The deputy prime minister, concurrently the NUB minister,  should head the coordination council for a meeting more than  once a week and the meeting should be immediately held at a  request from any member of the council, Kim ordered in a  security-related cabinet meeting on Thursday morning.    The coordination meeting will ensure more cooperative and  ready response to security issues, presidential spokesman Chu  Ton-sik said afterward.    At Kim's instruction, Deputy Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok is  expected to detail out operations of the council.    Because the soon-to-be-formed coordination meetings will be  held regularly at least more than once a week unlike the  existing high-level strategic meetings headed by the president  or prime minister that opens when necessary, they will prove  more productive and practical, Chu said.    Depending on the significance of the agenda, President Kim  will personally chair the meetings, he said.    Developments in North Korea and other major countries were  discussed in Thursday's breakfast discussion, Chu said.    It was concluded at the meeting that there was no solid  evidence that North Korea owns nuclear weapons at present, he  said.    Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported that there was no  conspicuous military movement in North Korea.</p>

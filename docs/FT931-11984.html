			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: ISA extends its European network IN A move to extend further its European distribution of branded consumables for information processing equipment, ISA International is to acquire CTS Svenska, which distributes in Sweden, for up to Pounds 6m. An initial Pounds 2.5m in shares is payable on completion. A further Pounds 3.5m in cash may be payable after an audit by ISA. Mr Andrew Heap, deputy chairman, said he wanted ISA to become truly pan-European - it would have 'greater purchasing muscle' and would not have to rely on the economy of any one country. At the same time, in its first fund-raising since coming to the market in 1987, ISA is conditionally placing, with clawback, 6.47m ordinary shares with institutional investors at 85p per share. The proceeds will be Pounds 5.5m, before expenses of Pounds 600,000. Mr Heap said the placing and offer would serve three functions. It would pay the deferred consideration; increase the working capital for the enlarged group; and improve the marketability of the shares. ISA's combined board holding will be diluted from about 25 per cent to 19 per cent. Since flotation, turnover has grown from Pounds 17m to an estimated Pounds 120m in 1992. The group is forecasting profits this year of 'not less than Pounds 3m', up 41 per cent on 1991.</p>

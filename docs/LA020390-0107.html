			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CAR FIRE DEATH IS CALLED MURDER;  </P> <P> CRIME: A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED NEAR THE VICTIM'S LAGUNA HILLS HOME AS HE TRIES TO  HITCH A RIDE OUT OF THE AREA. INVESTIGATORS SEEK A MOTIVE IN THE DEATH.  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies arrested a man on suspicion of murdering a young woman  outside her home Friday by deliberately ramming his car into her car, which  moments later burst into flames.  </P> <P> Ghaffari Hossein, 34, who told deputies he was from Canada, was arrested about  four hours after the collision when deputies found him trying to hitch a ride  at an intersection near the victim's Laguna Hills home.  </P> <P> Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Richard J. Olson said there was a "strong  odor" of a flammable substance inside the victim's vehicle. He added that the  car's fuel tank was intact, but he would not confirm whether Hossein is  suspected of igniting the vehicle.  </P> <P> Olson also would not release the victim's name or age. Friends of the victim  would identify her only as "Manija," and said she was in her mid-20s.  </P> <P> Investigators were trying to determine a motive. The incident occurred about 9  a.m. as the victim was leaving for work.  </P> <P> Olson alleged that Hossein parked his 1978 Toyota in a lot across from the  woman's home in the 25000 block of Via Lomas and waited for her to get in her  car, which was parked on the two-lane street.  </P> <P> "Then he accelerated at a high speed and hit her vehicle, knocking it over the  curb onto the lawn in front of a residence," Olson said.  </P> <P> At the scene, a quiet condominium complex, dozens of sheriff's deputies spent  hours sorting through a mass of burned wires in the woman's Honda sedan and  through the mangled yellow car driven by her assailant.  </P> <P> Witnesses interviewed at the scene said the woman's brother, unable to rescue  her from the burning car, tried frantically to douse the flames with a garden  hose.  </P> <P> "He was just crying (while) trying to put the fire out," said Rick Amato, who  spotted the car engulfed in flames as he drove down Alicia Parkway.  </P> <P> "There were a lot of people standing around the car, and they could have saved  her, but everyone was afraid that the car would blow up," Amato said, adding  that neighbors could not understand the brother's cries for help because he was  speaking in a foreign language.  </P> <P> Neighbors said the victim and her family were Iranian immigrants who spoke  little English and who had lived in the home for about a year.  </P> <P> Deputies were tipped off to Hossein's whereabouts, near the corner of Alicia  Parkway and Paseo De Valencia, by witnesses who said they saw a bleeding man  fleeing on foot from the scene.  </P> <P> "He was running up the middle of Alicia Parkway, trying to wipe the blood off  his face with a towel," Amato said.  </P> <P> Investigators found a bloodied jacket on the lawn in front of the woman's home  and bloody fingerprints on the entry gate, as well as a bloodied towel,  witnesses said.  </P> <P> Hossein is being held in the jail ward at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana for  treatment of minor injuries, Olson said. An autopsy on the victim is scheduled  today.  </P> <P> Throughout Friday, more than a dozen friends and relatives of the victim  gathered outside the family home to console one another. Most declined comment.  </P> <P> Another of the victim's brothers, who arrived late Friday afternoon from the  central California coastal community of Santa Maria, burst into tears when  friends described the events that killed his sister. "I can't talk right now,"  he said, wiping his eyes.  </P> <P> "We don't know anything except that she was on her way to work," said family  friend Tom Bulgari.  </P></p>

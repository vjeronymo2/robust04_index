As of the end of November, they have cracked 22  major cases of smuggling in Shandong, Guangxi, Jiangsu,  Liaoning, Zhejiang, Hainan, Fujian and other provinces,  confiscating 1,557 smuggled vehicles, 29,000 cases of  cigarettes, 23,800 tons of scrap metal, as well as air  conditioners, color television sets, cameras and other items  worth some 260 million yuan. On the evening of 24 July this  year, the Huanqiu, a freighter of Honduran registry belonging to  the Hong Kong Maritime Shipping Company Limited, entered Yantai  harbor carrying 8,000 cartons of contraband cigarettes bound for  the Fugang [Fujian-Hong Kong] Fuxing Aquatic Products Company  Limited of Yantai city in Shandong Province. The Yantai Coastal  Defense units in close cooperation with the customs departments,  worked on the case from four different angles. On the following  day when the Huanqiu off-loaded the contraband at Bajiao Port in  Fushan and prepared to depart, all of the smugglers were  apprehended on the scene. The Qinzhou Prefecture Economic  Development General Corporation in Guangxi and the Dongxing  South-Central Economic Development Corporation and the Qinzhou  Prefecture Materials Trade Corporation smuggled in 25 vehicles  and 100 copy machines. When the Guangxi Qinzhou Prefecture  Anti-smuggling Office received reports of this from the public,  they acted immediately and nabbed all of the smugglers. At  present, the public security organs in Shandong, Guangxi,  Jiangsu, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Hainan and Fujian, acting under the  instructions of the party center and State Council to vigorously  prosecute all crimes of smuggling, are actively investigating  other cases under the guidance of the Public Security Bureau and  are striving for even greater achievements.</p>

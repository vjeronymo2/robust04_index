			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Technology: Letting the wind take the strain - Worth Watching Rain, wind and blizzards frequently occur in the highlands of Scotland. But ScotRail is turning the extreme weather conditions to its advantage. At the remote station of Corrour travellers used to wander in the dark if their trains arrived after dusk because the station had no electricity. The station now has an automatic lighting system which uses wind to power it. Developed by Proven Engineering Products, of Kilmarnock, the turbine on its 6.5-metre mast charges a bank of batteries which powers the lights. A sensor determines when artificial light is needed, while a timer illuminates the station half an hour before each evening train is due. Proven Engineering: UK, 0563 43020.</p>

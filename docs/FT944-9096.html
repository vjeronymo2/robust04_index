			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Bankrupt debts up 50% in Japan The strains of recession continue to take their toll of corporate Japan, even into the beginning of the economic upturn, as shown by a sharp rise in bankruptcy debts last month. Debts left by corporate collapses rose by nearly half from September to Y845bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in October, just over double the level the same time last year, according to Teikoku Databank, a private credit research agency. The figures are always volatile, distorted in this case by the Y518.5bn bankruptcy of Nippon Mortgage, the third largest business collapse of post-war years. They nevertheless highlight the continuing weakness of corporate balance sheets. However, there was good news in the number of company collapses, down by 2.5 per cent from a year earlier, for the fourth month in a row. Nearly two thirds blamed their failure on the recession, while a mere 10 out of the total of 1,226 October bankruptcies cited the yen's strength as the reason for their collapse.</p>

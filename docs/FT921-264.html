			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Election 1992: No contest - Ballot Box Nothing new out of Northern Ireland. The Irish bookmakers, Eastwoods, are forecasting that all 17 Ulster MPs will keep their seats. That includes Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, who continues to fight Belfast West, but declines to sit in Westminster. Adams had a majority of only 2,221 over the mainly Catholic SDLP at the last election. Ian Paisley, by contrast, had a majority of more than 23,000 in Antrim North, but says he is fighting as if he is in danger of losing his deposit. The odds against this are unquotable.</p>

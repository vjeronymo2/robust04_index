			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Leading Article: Risks facing Russian reform THINGS ARE rotten in the state of Russian reform. Worse, the west's tardy assistance makes it appear as much a part of the problem as of the solution. If things continue to slide as they have in recent weeks, the question will soon be asked: who lost Russia? The answer would be that western small-mindedness played a substantial part. The fundamental error of the west has been to view reform in the former Soviet Union, particularly in Russia, as just another of those problems of impoverishment that beset it. This attitude explains why assistance was offered too late and was probably too little. That is also why the inward-looking and overstretched Bretton Woods institutions have carried so much of the burden. The west's stand-point shows a weak grasp of strategic imperatives. It is wrong because the collapse of a heavily armed superpower creates risks and opportunities on a much greater scale than, for example, Brazil. Reforming Russia is the most important economic challenge since the reconstruction of postwar western Europe. The west's stand-point also shows a weak grasp of the economic requirements. Russia needs more moral support, more material aid and vastly more technical assistance than most other economies in difficulty. Without such support this round of reform will collapse in hyperinflation, possibly quite soon. The growing influence of industrialists whose skill lies in producing goods that nobody wants and the return of a central banker whose skill lies in printing money may not be surprising. But the consequences are predictable. Optimists may argue that a Weimar-style collapse could be the harbinger of real reform. But it could also mark the return of something far darker. Grudgingly approved It is already clear that the Russians are unlikely to receive further balance of payments or budgetary support this year on top of the paltry Dollars 1bn 'first tranche' credit that the IMF has grudgingly approved. In addition, the absence of a medium-term debt service reduction agreement is hampering the Russian ability to plan reform at all. Meanwhile, western technical assistance is largely of the 'fly in, lecture and fly out' variety. Yet Russia needs access to a wide range of western competence to solve the huge technical problems it faces; and it needs it on tap. The west - probably under the purposive US leadership that has been so signally lacking - should have reached the following conclusions: first, macroeconomic stabilisation cannot be made a condition for assistance, but should be viewed as its hoped-for consequence; second, givers of technical assistance must work alongside the Russian government; and third, structural reform - the introduction of a market economy - is as important as stabilisation, quite possibly more so. Required assistance Moreover, it is far from clear that the IMF and the World Bank are the right institutions to deliver the required assistance. They were not thought the right institutions for postwar Europe. It may already be too late to reverse the loss of momentum. But the effort should be made. Given the depreciation of the rouble, quite modest sums - as little as Dollars 5bn-Dollars 8bn - should enable Russia to balance its budget. The fiction that a few months from now Russia will service its debts must also be abandoned. It will not. A few years from now might be another matter. Furthermore, the group of seven industrial countries should ensure an adequate flow of technical assistance. Assistance should not be given without conditions. But an austere target for this year's budget deficit is a misconceived precondition. The purpose of the assistance is to help close the deficit. Above all, assistance should not be delayed until there is little risk of failure. Any assistance to Russia involves risk. But rarely can what is being risked have been so small - just a few billions of dollars - against the potential gain. By waiting until the Russian government demonstrates it is likely to succeed, the west greatly increases the likelihood of its failure. Western governments must act decisively and involve themselves more fully, before it is too late.</p>

			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / London Stock Exchange: FT-SE at 18-month low in poor trade WEAKNESS in other European markets, triggered by a sharp fall in Japan's Nikkei Average to within a few points of the important 15,000 benchmark, gave a further blow yesterday to UK equities already reeling from recent evidence of recessionary pressures on British companies. The first session of the new equity account saw the FT-SE index shed a further 25 points to trade at levels not seen since the end of the Gulf war 18 months ago. The stock market opened sharply lower and was nearly 30 points off at mid-session. However, turnover remained poor in the London market and nearly one third of the Footsie's loss reflected technical reductions in a handful of blue chip stocks to allow for dividend payments. At the close, the FT-SE index was 24.4 points down at 2,325.7; the index closed at 2,322.2 on February 26 1991 when the Gulf war was moving to its end, jumping to 2,348 the next day as UK base rates were cut to 13 per cent. The market's gloom on Friday night, as the Footsie approached the sensitive 2,350 mark, deepened over the weekend on press reports of a highly bearish survey of prospects for the UK housing market from Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank. The collapse of the domestic housing market, with its implications for the construction and property industries as well as for banks and mortgage companies, is regarded as a significant restraint on recovery in both the UK economy and stock market. The problem of low consumer confidence found further expression in the June consumer credit statistics, which disclosed a net repayment of Pounds 55m debt by UK consumers evidently still nervous of spending in the high street stores. Bank shares, still perturbed by last week's negative trading statement from Barclays Bank, gave ground again and store shares were mostly easier. But the composite insurers, which announce trading profits this week under the lead of General Accident, managed to put on a brighter face yesterday. The UK market was not helped by a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, which was 6.48 Dow points off in London hours. However, British Petroleum picked itself up off the floor after the heavy fall which followed the board's decision last week to cut the quarterly dividend. The institutions showed no inclination to take up new positions as the account got under way. Traders commented that most of the session was featured by a trickle of small selling orders. Seaq volume of 331m was low, even by recent standards, and compared with 480.3m shares on Friday. Retail, or customer, business increased to just over Pounds 1bn on Friday when both institutional and private investors continued to grapple with the implications of the week's flow of alarming company news. The mood in the market yesterday was one of apathy rather than of alarm. Equity traders believe that, with the FT-SE 2,350 mark now apparently lost, the market is searching for a new support level.</p>

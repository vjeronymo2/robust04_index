			<p>Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities in Argentina monitored through 6  January.    The Argentine Government has privatized Hidroelectrica  Norpatagonica Inc. with the sale of the Piedra de Aguila  hydroelectric plant to the Hidroneuquen investor group. The  company made up of Chilean, U.S., and Canadian capital purchased  59 percent of the shares. (Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish 29  Dec 93 Economic Section p 1)    The trade deficit increased $400 million in October and "the  upward trend will increase in the last two months of the year."  Government figures show a trade deficit of $2.327 billion by the  end of October and total exports until then were $10.9 billion  while total imports were $13.2 billion.    The economic team says it is not concerned because most of  the imports are capital goods and the projected deficit amounts  to $2.8 billion for the year.

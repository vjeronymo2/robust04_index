			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> A mother jailed for more than two years in a bitter child custody dispute said  her daughter is fine. Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who was released from the District  of Columbia Jail on Monday, said on WUSA-TV: "Two years ago, (my daughter) was  a terrified, traumatized victim of incest. Today she is a proud, happy girl who  knows she is worth protecting, and I am very proud of her." Morgan was jailed  in August, 1987, after she failed to produce Hilary, now 7, for a supervised  court-ordered visit with her father, Dr. Eric Foretich. Morgan claims Foretich  sexually abused the child; Foretich has denied the allegation. Morgan's release  was the result of a law passed by Congress and signed by President Bush last  week limiting civil contempt jail terms in the District of Columbia to 12  months. Foretich, appearing on ABC's "Good Morning America," said: "I would  have been in support of that bill if the bill had a provision mandating a  government agency such as the FBI be required to find my daughter."  </P></p>

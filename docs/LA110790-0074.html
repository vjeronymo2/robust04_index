			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO PURSUE SUIT FOR HALF OF FRYMAN  </P> <P> Taking a get-tough tack after unsuccessful attempts to reach an agreement on a  sales price with the owner of Fryman Canyon in Studio City, the Santa Monica  Mountains Conservancy has decided to press on with a lawsuit for title to half  the land.  </P> <P> Conservancy officials confirmed Tuesday that the parks agency has directed its  attorneys to proceed with a lawsuit to obtain 31 acres of the canyon for  parkland.  </P> <P> The canyon has been the subject of a lengthy, intense battle between the owner,  Fred Sahadi, who wants to build a 26-home development there, and  environmentalists and neighbors who oppose the project, allied with state and  city agencies that want to buy the land for park purposes.  </P> <P> The conservancy, a state parks agency, and Sahadi remain $2.15 million apart on  a purchase price, the conservancy valuing the land at $8.75 million and Sahadi  asking for $10.9 million.  </P> <P> "In no way, shape or form are we going to let them keep our 31 acres. Those are  rightfully ours, for open space," said Carole Stevens, conservancy chairwoman.  </P> <P> The conservancy lawsuit, filed Aug. 31, alleges that the city erred several  years ago by not enforcing its own requirement that Sahadi donate the 31 acres  to the conservancy before receiving city building permission.  </P> <P> The action by the conservancy took place late Monday during an executive  session. The lawsuit was filed by the state attorney general's office, which  represents the conservancy in litigation.  </P> <P> Stevens said the lawsuit -- if it succeeds -- might affect the profitability of  Sahadi's proposed project. The 31 acres, which the state claims, separate two  portions of the planned project, and the developer intends to build a temporary  road across the area over which dirt will be hauled to build construction pads  for the homes.  </P> <P> If the conservancy owned the 31 acres, it could block construction of the  temporary road and force the developer to seek a much more expensive  dirt-hauling route on city streets that would require new City Hall permits.  </P> <P> Coupled with the new "green-light" directive to the attorneys was a board  action, also discussed at length during Monday's executive session, to adopt a  plan to offer Sahadi $8.75 million for his property, located just north of  Mulholland Drive.  </P> <P> Sahadi's attorney, Neil Papiano, told the conservancy board Monday that its  $8.75 million offer was too low.  </P> <P> Sahadi previously said he was willing to accept a $10.9-million buyout plan  unveiled Sept. 8 by Mayor Tom Bradley and Los Angeles City Councilman Michael  Woo.  </P> <P> The Bradley-Woo plan envisioned the conservancy contributing $8.7 million of  its money toward the $10.9-million price, the city kicking in $1.96 million and  private donors contributing $240,000.  </P> <P> But the conservancy at its Monday meeting received a new state-sanctioned  appraisal that set the value of the property at $8.75 million. The board  subsequently adopted a buyout plan that set a $6.7-million lid on the amount  the conservancy would contribute.  </P></p>

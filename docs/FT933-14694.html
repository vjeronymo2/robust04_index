			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Ellis &amp; Everard declines 3% and warns of price pressure ELLIS &amp; Everard, the chemicals distributor, yesterday warned of continuing pressure on prices as it announced a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to April 30. Mr Peter Wood, chief executive, said: 'There is a lot of pressure on pricing which is in the hands of the manufacturers.' Profits fell from Pounds 12.6m - before exceptional losses of Pounds 9.6m - to Pounds 12.2m after reduction and rationalisation costs of Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 1m). Group sales rose to Pounds 394.6m (Pounds 383.4m). The departure of the former chairman Mr Michael Marshall accounted for Pounds 350,000 of the costs; the rest was divided between redundancy payments - 300 jobs were shed - and rationalisation expenses. Turnover in the UK increased to Pounds 145.2m (Pounds 133.1m) and operating profit was up 1 per cent to Pounds 9.6m. In the US, sales rose from Dollars 339.7m to Dollars 352.4m (Pounds 235m) and operating profit increased by 13 per cent to Dollars 9.9m as the number of operating sites was cut by seven to 30. European sales fell to Pounds 33.3m (Pounds 40.3m) showing breakeven at the operating level. The pool division, which makes and supplies accessories and chemicals for swimming pools, was still in loss. The Spanish operation also recorded a loss and was merged with Cat, a Spanish distributor. Borrowing remain static at Pounds 9.1m, representing 13 per cent of shareholders' funds. Earnings per share fell to 10.3p (11.5p adjusted for the exceptional items). The final dividend is maintained at 4.8p, making an unchanged 7.05p. COMMENT The price recovery longed for by Ellis &amp; Everard is unlikely to materialise in the short term. US chemical prices, which fell by a further 5 per cent over the last year, show no signs of improvement. As a distributor the company can only look on as the manufacturers battle it out. At least volume gains suggest that customers and suppliers are making increasing use of distributors. By facing up to a number of problems nearer to home, such as the loss-making pool side and the Spanish operation, it will be in a stronger position to produce better figures next year. Analysts expect full year pre-tax profits of Pounds 14.5m, which put the shares - down 2p to 209p  -on a prospective multiple of 17.4. That still looks too demanding against the market sector average of 14.5.</p>

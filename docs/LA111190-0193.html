			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERMANS GIVE GORBACHEV ROUSING SEND-OFF, THANKS;  </P> <P> EUROPE: KOHL CITES THE SOVIET LEADER'S ROLE IN UNIFICATION. CROWDS CHEER HIM ON  THE STREET.  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev concluded a two-day trip to Germany on  Saturday, a visit that symbolized the new, post-unification relationship  between the two countries.  </P> <P> Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, left Germany for Moscow on Saturday evening. The  Soviet delegation, which also included Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze,  was seen off at the Frankfurt airport by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich  Genscher.  </P> <P> Before they left, thousands of people chanting, "Gorby, Gorby," and waving  Soviet flags, thronged the streets as Gorbachev toured several central German  towns with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, crediting him with a major role in the  process that led to German reunification Oct. 3.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's arrival in Bonn on Friday coincided with the first anniversary of  the Nov. 9, 1989, opening of the Berlin Wall while East Germany's Stalinist  system was crumbling.  </P> <P> "Many of these changes would not have been possible without your personal  participation and your support -- this is also the case for German unification,  and I would like to thank you warmly for this," Kohl told Gorbachev after the  two talked privately Saturday evening at the chancellor's Oggersheim residence.  </P> <P> Standing outside the villa in the central German state of Rhineland-Palatinate  as he prepared to leave for home, Gorbachev told the Bonn leader that "It was a  long and difficult path . . . to reach today's stage and today's historic  agreements."  </P> <P> Following extensive talks in Bonn, the two leaders Friday signed a cooperation  treaty that formalizes the new bilateral relations, while their aides signed an  economic treaty and a bilateral social agreement.  </P> <P> Although Gorbachev apparently did not make specific requests for German  credits, the leaders talked at length about the Soviet economic reforms and a  German role in them.  </P> <P> "We hope that your reform policy will be successful, and we will assist within  our possibilities," Kohl told his Soviet guest.  </P> <P> Before traveling to the Rhineland-Palatinate, Gorbachev met in Bonn on Saturday  morning with liberal and opposition Social Democratic politicians.  </P></p>

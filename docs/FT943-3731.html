			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Czech-German rail move Czech Railways and Deutsche Bahn, its German equivalent, are to begin transporting freight trucks on roll on-roll off trains across the Czech/German border from September 25 in an attempt to speed up journey times and lower costs, writes Vincent Boland in Prague. The service will run on the 110km rail link between Dresden and the Czech town of Lovosice, 65km north of Prague. It will initially carry 25 trucks daily but is expected to be able to transport a quarter of the estimated 2,000 freight vehicles that cross the border each day. The journey time will be 2 1/2 hours, with continuous customs facilities, at a cost of DM85 (Dollars 54) per journey.</p>

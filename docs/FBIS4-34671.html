			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Alonso Urrutia] </F>   [Text] Yesterday, Ernesto Zedillo, PRI [Institutional  Revolutionary Party] Mexican presidential candidate, said that  to end the Chiapas conflict, the government of the Republic  should "establish, as soon as possible, a board with political  and social representation, and authority to engage in a  dialogue, in a definite negotiation," with the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN].    The candidate who headed the installation ceremony of the  Consulting Board of the Mexican Foundation Cambio 21, Luis  Donaldo Colosio, said that a political solution to the  continuing conflict is the only answer. "The only road to peace  is the political process." No progress, no true solution will  be possible through violence. [quotation marks as published]    Before approximately 50 councilmen assembled at the Museum  of  Mexico City, Zedillo said the political process is "the  pluralistic, participative, and legitimate forum" to implement  changes and to solve differences.    Zedillo assured that democracy is the supreme value of the  political process and that it is indispensable for Mexico's  progress. "All economic progress, all social improvement can  only last within a democratic framework."    Zedillo noted that in the past years, electoral reforms have  been fostered and that these reforms have allowed adaptation of  legislation to society's requirements. He talked about the  Senate's new configuration, the elimination of the clause of  governalibilty in the Deputies Chamber, the "decisive presence"  of citizens in the Federal Electoral Institute, as well as the  establishment of ceilings for campaign spending.    Nevertheless, he recognized that it is necessary to improve  the system. "Democracy cannot be imposed by the government, by a  political party, by an ideological current, or by a group.  Above all, democracy cannot be imposed nor perfected by the use  of violence or by appealing to measures outside the law or  institutions."    Zedillo emphasized that Mexico is a pluralistic society,  expressed through a regime of parties with diverse visions, but,  he added it is also a nation of laws and institutions.  "Democracy is based on the enforcement of our state of law."    The candidate added that Mexican democracy is strengthened  by  greater participation and the presence of its community and its  organizations. "One of the challenges our party faces is to  recognize and foster citizen participation, including those who  say they are not active in any political party."    "Political parties should encourage citizens and  organizations to participate, however, citizens in turn should  respect the multiparty activists and the functions the  Constitution grants them as entities of public interest."    Zedillo said it is necessary to progress toward the  perfection of democracy through the internal strengthening of  political organizations "to invigorate our electoral processes  and to overcome abstentionism and skepticism." An important  factor for democracy is dialogue."    The conflict that emerged in Chiapas is a signal to the  nation's conscience, Zedillo added. In Chiapas, we share in the  responsibility to undertake serious social reforms to assure  each family, each community, adequate living conditions and  genuine opportunities for the well being of everyone."    "It is our obligation to find a true and speedy resolution  of  economic and regional problems. We share in the desire for  peace in Chiapas to be obtained quickly and with justice, based  on a dialogue, understanding, and the best intentions of the  parties involved in the conflict."    "No true resolution will be possible through violence. A  resolution will only be possible in a climate of peace, respect  for the law, and constructive dialogue. This is why we reject  the use of force. This is why we appeal that resolution to this  conflict be sought through the political process, that the  resolution to the Chiapas conflict be found through dialogue."</p>

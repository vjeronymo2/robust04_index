			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: China group cuts Giordano stake China Resources, one of China's leading trading companies in Hong Kong, has sold virtually all its stake in Giordano, the Hong Kong retailer controlled by Mr Jimmy Lai who recently offended Beijing by publishing a passionate denunciation of the Chinese Communist party. The move by China Resources - which has reduced its 10.13 per cent interest in Giordano to 0.35 per cent - was seen as further evidence of the disfavour in which Giordano is held in Beijing. The transaction took place at HKDollars 4.70 a share, and the stock was placed with European and Asian institutions. Mr Lai, who also publishes the highly successful Next magazine in the colony, accused the Communist party in August of having ruined Chinese culture. He also launched a personal attack on Mr Li Peng, the Chinese prime minister, in part claiming that his behaviour on a visit to Germany, where he dodged human rights activists, had humiliated the Chinese people. Soon after the publication of the article, China's ministry of foreign economic trade and co-operation (Moftec) withdrew permission for Giordano to run a store in Beijing's Wangfujing Street. This was immediately followed by Mr Lai's resignation from the chairmanship of Giordano in an attempt to protect his company from further discrimination. China Resources, which is owned by Moftec, was a foundation shareholder of Giordano when it was listed in 1991. Along with the sale of its stake in the company, Mr Wang Xin Wen, its representative on the board, resigned. Giordano bounced back in the first six months of this year posting profits of HKDollars 85.3m (USDollars 11m), up more than 58 per cent on the previous corresponding period.</p>

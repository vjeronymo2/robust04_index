			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RACE TO DEVELOP HIGH-DEFINITION TV INTENSIFIES  </P> <P> The competition to develop high-definition television revved up on Thursday  with the announcement that the U.S. divisions of two European electronics  giants have joined NBC-TV to research advanced TV systems.  </P> <P> Philips Consumer Electronics Co. said it will join an existing research venture  of Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc. and NBC. Philips is part of NV Philips of  the Netherlands, while Thomson is the U.S. division of Thomson SA of France.  </P> <P> The venture faces stiff competition from research efforts under way in Japan  and Europe into high-definition television, which promises picture quality as  crisp as photographs and crystal-clear sound.  </P> <P> In addition, Zenith Electronics Corp., the last major TV manufacturer in the  United States, has joined American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to develop an  HDTV system.  </P> <P> The new three-way alliance of Philips, Thomson and NBC drew praise from several  industry observers.  </P> <P> "I think it's a fairly wise, competitive decision," said Pat Hill Hubbard, a  vice president of the American Electronics Assn. "Research is very costly in  this field."  </P> <P> Laura J. Lederman, an analyst with the Chicago investment firm Duff &amp;  Phelps Inc., said the combination of manufacturers and broadcasters was  critical. "If you have companies that build a set but you don't have  broadcasters, you're missing some of the pieces," she said.  </P> <P> Together, Philips and Thomson control almost 40% of the U.S. television-set  market. Philips makes the Magnavox, Sylvania, Philco and Philips brands, while  Thomson owns the former General Electric and RCA lines.  </P> <P> NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., has been cooperating with Thomson  for several years at the David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., to  develop advanced television systems.  </P> <P> NBC and Thomson are working on a system called Advanced Compatible TV, which  would provide an improved picture on new wide-screen TV sets while allowing  continued use of conventional sets.  </P> <P> Advanced Compatible TV would require only minor, low-cost adjustments to  equipment at local TV stations, Thomson and NBC said.  </P></p>

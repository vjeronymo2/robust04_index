			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: KIDNAP VICTIM FREED; 3 SUSPECTS ARRESTED  </P> <P> Police freed a kidnaping victim Wednesday and arrested three suspects after a  high-speed chase through the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Rubell S. Shumahine, 33, of Los Angeles was rescued, shaken but unharmed, from  a car that was pulled over by police in Granada Hills shortly after 1 a.m., Los  Angeles Police Department Lt. Ron Lewis said.  </P> <P> Salvador Feliciano, 28, and Lisa Parry, 23, both of Van Nuys, and Eugene Cumba,  39, of Los Angeles were arrested on suspicion of kidnaping for ransom.  </P> <P> Lewis said the motive for the abduction appeared to be rooted in a business  dispute between Shumahine and an acquaintance of the suspects. Shumahine owns  an auto-body repair shop in the Mid-Wilshire District that is facing financial  difficulties, Lewis said.  </P> <P> "The suspects believed he owed money" to an individual whom police did not  identify and "they were going to get it for him," Lewis said. Shumahine's  girlfriend had received calls from his captors demanding $60,000 ransom, police  said.  </P></p>

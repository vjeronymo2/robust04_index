			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Whinney Mackay stays in loss THE DIFFICULT trading conditions experienced in the second half of last year by Whinney Mackay-Lewis, the USM-quoted architectural practice, continued in the opening half of the 1992/93 year. As a result the company finished the six months to end-October Pounds 353,000 in loss at the pre-tax level compared with previous profits of Pounds 119,000. For the 1991/92 year as a whole Whinney incurred a loss of Pounds 435,000, after an exceptional provision of Pounds 163,000. First half turnover tumbled from Pounds 3.29m to Pounds 1.97m and led to an operating deficit of Pounds 109,000, against a profit of Pounds 375,000. Mr Jeremy Mackay-Lewis, chairman, said it had not been possible 'to keep pace with the decline in turnover for London-based operations', in spite of continued cost cutting in line with falling new commissions and 'tight fee margins'. London developers were reluctant to go ahead with projects which were not pre-let. However, the refurbishment market was improving and the group recently received a number of valuable contracts. In central London the group won planning approval for Basinghall House, for Wates City of London Properties, and Wellington House, for Trafalgar House. Hoggett Lock-Necrews, the subsidiary, was busy with food retailing superstores and a food distribution centre near the Severn Bridge. The group's Welsh and international operations secured new business but margins were under pressure. Losses per share were 3.7p (earnings 0.7p).</p>

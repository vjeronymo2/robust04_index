			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From ASAHI SHIMBUN 11 April Evening Edition] </F>   [Text] On the afternoon of 11 April, Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa severely criticized a meeting of top leaders  of three parties -- the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ],  the Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], and Sakigake [Harbinger]  -- and a floor group held earlier in the day.    At the Prime Minister's Office, Hosokawa told reporters: "I  think the meeting is wrong. Since coalition parties have agreed  to pick (the next prime minister) at the party representatives  meeting [attended by party secretaries general], the meeting of  party heads should be held after that. The coalition will not  be able to reach an accord if the top-level meeting comes first."</p>

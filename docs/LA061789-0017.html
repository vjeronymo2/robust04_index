			<p><P> June 17, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. OPEN;  </P> <P> A 64 GIVES STRANGE A CHANCE TO REPEAT;  </P> <P> KITE TRAILS BY ONE SHOT AFTER 36 HOLES  </P> <P> There is pressure enough while playing in a U.S. Open, but now Curtis Strange  has the added burden of being in position to become the first player to win  consecutive titles since Ben Hogan in 1950 and '51.  </P> <P> Strange moved quickly to the top of the leader board Friday by shooting a 64,  six under par, for a 36-hole total of 135 at Oak Hill Country Club.  </P> <P> The PGA player of the year in 1988 with earnings of more than $1 million,  Strange held a one-stroke lead over Tom Kite, who had a 69 to go with the 67 he  shot Thursday.  </P> <P> Scott Simpson, the former USC star who won the Open in 1987, also remained in  contention. He shot a par 70 for a two-day total of 137 and was tied with Jay  Don Blake, who shot a 71.  </P> <P> Sixteen players were within five shots of the lead.  </P> <P> Strange made two birdies and an eagle on the first five holes to pick up  momentum early on a day when a brief rainstorm postponed play for 14 minutes  late in the afternoon.  </P> <P> When someone asked Strange if he'd had a notion that he was in the lead after  holing a 115-yard wedge shot for an eagle on the par-five, 570-yard fourth  hole, he responded dryly:  </P> <P> "When that thing went in, I knew I wasn't far from it. I told myself I didn't  want to back off now."  </P> <P> Strange was, of course, gratified by his round, which included five birdies and  an eagle. He had only one bogey, at the par-four, 458-yard 17th hole.  </P> <P> "I played really good and kept my thoughts where they should be," he said. "But  it's only Friday, and we have a long ways to go. Tomorrow is the important  round, the one in which you want to stay close."  </P> <P> Johnny Miller set the U.S. Open record for one round with a 63 in 1973.  </P> <P> Strange said he didn't give it a thought when he was on the course with its  tight fairways and penalizing rough.  </P> <P> "I couldn't care less because 64 isn't bad," he added.  </P> <P> And when someone told him that he had tied the course record set by Hogan in  1942 and equaled by Jeff Sluman in 1987, Strange said: "You don't give a darn  what you shoot. You just block it out and think about your game."  </P> <P> Strange wasn't being disrespectful of records, but winning the Open is a much  higher priority.  </P> <P> Reporters were continually reminding Strange of the pressure of trying to  emulate Hogan.  </P> <P> Strange smiled and said, "I was going along having a good time here and I was  surprised how calm I was. I won't be as calm now."  </P> <P> Strange, 34, doesn't have to be reminded about chasing the ghost of Hogan's  accomplishment. He has been told enough about it all year.  </P> <P> "The Open gets your blood flowing," he said. "You want to do well because  you're the defending champion."  </P> <P> Strange hasn't won on the PGA Tour this year and he said he just hasn't played  consistently.  </P> <P> But he was obviously proud of his 64 on a demanding course.  </P> <P> "It was better than any round that I shot last year at Brookline (Mass.), he  said, referring to the 1988 Open.  </P> <P> Strange said he maintains an outwardly calm demeanor on the course but admitted  that he's more nervous than he might appear to be.  </P> <P> "Now it begins," he said. "Jack Nicklaus once told me that you can't win the  Open on Thursday and Friday, but you can lose it."  </P> <P> Kite, 39, is recognized as, perhaps, the best active player who hasn't won a  major event -- the U.S. Open, Masters, British Open and PGA Championship. He's  in position now.  </P> <P> "I didn't have as easy a day today as I had Thursday when I shot 67," Kite  said. "But it was more of a satisfying round because I wasn't driving that  well. I just hung in there when I could have knocked myself out."  </P> <P> Kite had three birdies and two bogeys in his round of 69.  </P> <P> Asked about the pressure on Strange as the defending champion, Kite said: "I  don't think a one-shot lead at this point makes much difference. There are guys  who are seven or eight shots back who still have a chance to win."  </P> <P> Strange beat Kite last November in a playoff at the rich Nabisco Championships  in Pebble Beach. Kite had won at least one tournament for seven consecutive  years, but he was shut out in 1988.  </P> <P> Kite, who is paired with Strange today, said they were going to have as much  fun as the competition will allow.  </P> <P> "We're good friends," Kite said, adding, "I haven't had much fun in the Open."  </P> <P> Kite's best finish in 17 previous Opens was a tie for eighth. He has missed the  cut six times.  </P> <P> Some prominent players missed the cut Friday, namely Ben Crenshaw, Sandy Lyle,  Bob Tway, Fuzzy Zoeller and Lee Trevino.  </P> <P> Simpson said he wasn't hitting the ball especially well, but his chipping saved  him in his round of 70. He had four birdies that were offset by four bogeys.  </P> <P> When asked how he felt while trying to defend his Open championship last year,  Simpson said, "I was pretty relaxed. People said a defending champion couldn't  win and that helped me to relax."  </P> <P> Simpson gave it a good try, though, leading after two rounds and only one shot  behind after 54 holes.  </P> <P> "I don't think the pressure will bother Curtis," Simpson said. "He's a great  player, a real good iron player. He has a chance to do it."  </P> <P> Simpson, 33, is confident, too, about his own game.  </P> <P> "I'm just thankful I'm playing good," he said. "Winning in Atlanta (three weeks  ago) helped my confidence a lot. And it's a lot of fun to play well in the  Open."  </P> <P> Now the question is, how much longer will the fun last for Simpson, Kite -- and  Strange.  </P> <P> Golf Notes  </P> <P> Jack Nicklaus, who was one stroke off the lead with his 67 Thursday, soared to  a 74 Friday for a 36-hole total of 141. . . . Jay Don Blake, Payne Stewart and  Bernhard Langer were the co-leaders Thursday, each shooting a 66. Blake slipped  two shots behind Curtis Strange. Langer had a miserable round of 78 (144  total), while Stewart shot a 75 (141). . . . The cut was at 145. . . . Tom  Pernice, the former UCLA player, had a 75 after shooting a 67 Thursday. . . .  Nick Faldo, the Masters champion, is at 140 after shooting a 72. . . . There  were 21 sub-par rounds Thursday, breaking the first-round Open record of 19 set  in 1980. . . . There were 17 sub-par rounds Friday.  </P></p>

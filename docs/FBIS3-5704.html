			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lao </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by National Assembly Chairman Saman Vi-gnaket at the </F> opening ceremony of the third ordinary session of the Third  National Assembly in Vientiane on 9 March -- recorded]    [Text] Today, the third ordinary session of our Third  National Assembly is convened to discuss and endorse a number of  important, urgent issues. The session is being held after the  date stipulated in the National Assembly law, because there were  certain urgent, significant tasks that we had to settle during  the period that the session was expected to be convened. Our  session is now being held in an atmosphere in which the  international and regional situations have continued to develop  in the manner which is both favorable and unfavorable to the  implementation of the two strategic tasks and the restructuring  line of our party and state.    As the situations have developed, various hostile powers  have  not abandoned their intentions of effecting change through  peaceful means and interfering in the internal affairs of  various countries with a view to turning the entire world into  their orbit. The tension and conflicts between peoples of  different nationalities, origins, and religions in certain  countries and regions have continued. Various nations,  particularly developing and underdeveloped ones, have made great  efforts in struggling to safeguard political independence while  developing their economies and societies to raise their standard  of living. In Southeast Asia, the trend of peace, stability,  and cooperation among various countries has become ever more  evident, thus creating favorable conditions for the development  of our country.    Our ordinary session on this occasion is also being held in  a  joyous atmosphere in which our entire party, army, and people  have been striving and won initial satisfactory achievements in  realizing the sixth and seventh resolutions of the fifth Central  Committee, the socioeconomic development plan, and the state  budget plan for 1993-94 as endorsed by the Third National  Assembly in its second ordinary session. Our National Assembly  has also promoted and expanded its role, which are thus  beneficial to the implementation of the constitution and various  laws. Members of the National Assembly in each constituency  also have promoted and expanded their roles. They have visited  the people of all strata in each region regularly to encourage  them and to inspect, follow up, and boost implementation of the  socioeconomic development plan, state budget, and various  regulations and laws at the local level.    They have also given attention to the petitions, views, and  problems presented by the people and brought them to the  attention of local party and administrative committees for joint  discussion and settlement. Through the National Assembly  members, the people have come to clearly understand the roles  and duties of the deputies who represent the people and have  worked for their interests and rights to mastery. In each area  the people have felt comfortable in earning their living and  been confident in their future and our popular democratic system.    Along with these favorable conditions and achievements won  by  our people, we should frankly accept the fact that our nation  and people still face many difficulties and complicated problems  in carrying out socioeconomic development work and improving  their living conditions. It is, therefore, required that we  take appropriate measures to settle those difficulties and  problems step by step. To meet the requirements of state and  social management, the Third National Assembly has endorsed the  Constitution and a number of laws. Following the enforcement of  the Constitution and laws, the state and society have been  managed more effectively. Steps have been taken to manage the  state and society through the implementation of the laws.    Our country's socioeconomic foundation has developed and  prospered. The requirements of national development have  increased daily. Economic relations and cooperation with  foreign countries have been also enhanced. It is, therefore,  required that we reconsider, improve, and perfect certain laws  which have been already enacted in order to make them conform to  today's practical conditions. At the same time, it is necessary  to continue to study and implement more laws to perfect our  state and social management apparatuses.    Based on the said requirements, in this session, we will  discuss and endorse the amendment of the labor law and the law  on the promotion and management of foreign investments in the  Lao People's Democratic Republic [LPDR]. The reason why we must  urgently improve the two said laws is that the law on the  promotion and management of foreign investments in the LPDR was  put into effect before the enforcement of the constitution. As  for the labor law, it is consisted of certain provisions which  run counter to the constitution. It, therefore, needs to be  readjusted so as to be in conformity with the constitution as  well as the practical conditions on the socioeconomic  development. The amendment of the aforesaid two laws is part of  the amendment of various laws that will be done in the  subsequent sessions.    After having the laws, the important point is organizing  their implementation. Their implementation is considered to be  a factor in determining the success and the efficiency of the  enforced laws. In the past, we are of the view that law  enforcement has also done its best in performing its duties.  But, as the socioeconomic foundation has been increasingly  expanded and the number of state and social management  apparatuses has increased, the political quality of various law  enforcement organizations must be raised in order to guarantee  an ever more effective implementation of the laws. In addition,  the tenure of these organizations as stipulated in the  constitution has come to an end. In this session, it is,  therefore, imperative for us to elect the chairman of the  Supreme People's Court and the chief public prosecutor. We will  also have to discuss the internal regulations of the National  Assembly in order to make the organizational system of the  National Assembly to become ever firmer and stronger so as to  enable it to continue to efficiently implement its normal roles.  We will also review experiences scored by our National Assembly  in carrying out activities since the second ordinary session.    Distinguished assembly members, our ordinary session on this  occasion is very significant, because contents of the issues  that we will discuss and endorse in this session are related to  the implementation of our party's restructuring line. They are  also related to the raising the quality of this National  Assembly. For this reason, it is required that all National  Assembly members heighten their political responsibility. As  representatives who have worked for the interests and rights to  mastery of the people, we should comprehensively, profoundly,  and thoroughly look at the problems and then contribute views to  the session in a straightforward manner to successfully fulfill  the objectives and expectations in making decisions on and  endorsing the various significant issues that will be brought to  the session for consideration. In this arousing and joyous  atmosphere, as chairman of the session, I now would like to  announce the third ordinary session of the Third National  Assembly be officially opened. Thank you.

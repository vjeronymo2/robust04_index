			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(mst)"-signed report: "Grave Reservations About Jezek's </F> Resignation"]    [Text] Prague -- Yesterday, the National Property Fund  (FNM) Supervisory Board adopted a resolution in which it called  upon the FNM Presidium to state the reasons for the resignation  of the Fund's former chairman, Tomas Jezek, and the recall of  his two deputies -- Jan Prince and Jindrich Kapoun.    Supervisory Board Chairman Pavel Safarik told reporters that  his body does not see sufficient justification for the  appointment of Roman Ceska as the new chairman of the FNM  Executive Council. The argument that, due to the appointment of  the deputy privatization minister as the Fund's chairman, there  will be better interlinking between the Privatization Ministry  and the FNM, seems inadequate to them. In the opinion of the  Supervisory Board, these two institutions were already in close  contact prior to the recall of T. Jezek.    "The conflict of interests that led officially to Tomas  Jezek's resignation also relates to Roman Ceska," states the  resolution. The Supervisory Board also stated that the course of  action adopted by the Fund's Presidium in the recall of Tomas  Jezek and his two deputies damaged relations between the  privatization bodies and, as a consequence, may even endanger  the entire course of privatization.    Jan Klak, a member of the Supervisory Board, declared that  the Supervisory Board will demand that the Fund's Presidium,  which is chaired by Privatization Minister Jiri Skalicky, airs  its views immediately on the board's resolution. If its  response is inadequate, the Supervisory Board is prepared to  turn the matter over to parliament and the government.  Speculation that parliament could recall the Fund's Presidium  was described as premature by Safarik.    In reply to a question on what he thinks of the Supervisory  Board's resolution, FNM Chairman R. Ceska said that he had not  been informed of the contents of the board's meeting and refused  to comment. He said that he was not directly involved in the  recall of T. Jezek and that it would vex him if this were to  lead to a tense situation between him and the Supervisory Board.  He said that on Friday [17 June] morning he had asked the  Supervisory Board to help him resolve the situation in the FNM  in a calm manner. In reply to a question from LIDOVE NOVINY  regarding the state of the FNM when he took over from T. Jezek,  R. Ceska said: "There are certain problems of a more serious  nature here and they will not be resolved by waving a magic  wand."    [The same newspaper on the same date on page 3, under the  headline "Skalicky Is Standing Behind Ceska," carries a 300-word  CTK and "(il)"-signed report on Privatization Minister Jiri  Skalicky's reaction to the resolution adopted by the FNM  Supervisory Board. According to the report, Skalicky "does not  understand the formulation" according to which the board "does  not see sufficient justification for the appointment of Roman  Ceska as the new chairman of the FNM Executive Council." He  said that "he is prepared to inform the Supervisory Board in  detail of the reasons for this step" and added that the FNM  Presidium had tried "to ensure that the necessary changes in the  FNM's management were not made in an atmosphere of emotion and  mutual recrimination. Therefore, the Presidium's members did  not inform the public of the circumstances of Tomas Jezek's  resignation."]</p>

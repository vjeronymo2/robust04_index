			<p><P> April 23, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VINYL'S LAST STAND;  </P> <P> AT 'ALTERNATIVE' RECORD STORES, LPS' DAYS OF EXTENDED PLAY ARE SAFE FROM TIME  AND TECHNOLOGY  </P> <P> The announcement came last month: 14 Music Plus stores in Southern California  were pulling the records from their racks. A number of Wherehouse record stores  revealed that they planned to follow suit.  </P> <P> Vinyl LPs simply aren't selling enough, they said. Records are wasting space  that could be stocked with more popular cassette tapes and compact discs. The  public, they said, has spoken.  </P> <P> "The consumer, in a general way, has told us that he or she is interested in  having their audio experience either on cassette or CD format," a Music Plus  official said.  </P> <P> But such words amount to blasphemy in certain circles. Dozens of small record  shops across the city are refusing to submit to technological progress, digging  themselves in as the last bastion of the LP.  </P> <P> These places tend to be out-of-the-way storefronts where the guy behind the  counter is the owner. There usually isn't much neon light or interior  decoration, just wooden bins filled with used and hard-to-find records. An old  Connie Francis album might cost a dime and a rare Elvis Presley single might  fetch $1,500.  </P> <P> Vinyl ranks as gold in these quarters. Some of the shops don't even sell  cassettes or CDs.  </P> <P> Such "alternative" record stores have spent years eking out a living. Now, with  the imminent decline of the LP, they are hoping for a windfall.  </P> <P> "People are going into chain stores looking for records and can't find them,"  said Ronn Jackson of Penny Lane in Venice. "Panic is being spread."  </P> <P> "It's a good time to be in this business," said Kip Brown, who recently opened  Ear Candy in Van Nuys. "People come in here and say, 'Thank God you still sell  records.' "  </P> <P> It may be too early for record stores to count their profits, industry  observers say. The Recording Industry Assn. of America reports that LPs  represented only 15% of all 1987 music sales. At Music Plus' 59 stores, vinyl  accounts for 4% of sales.  </P> <P> Yet no one is ready to dismiss LPs outright, and hopes for big business among  small shops are not unrealistic, said a National Assn. of Recording  Merchandisers official. If nothing else, records should continue to sell for  economic reasons.  </P> <P> "The CDs cost $15. It's too expensive," said Len Kundstadt, publisher of Record  Research Magazine, a bimonthly New York publication. "Kids can go out and buy  two or three LPs for the price of one CD."  </P> <P> In the bargain bins at alternative shops -- where records go for 49 cents to $2  -- they can buy even more music for the dollar. Or, at a place like Ear Candy,  they can spend $15 on a rare Partridge Family album.  </P> <P> "People laugh when the see that stuff," Brown said. "But the Partridge Family  sells well."  </P> <P> Ear Candy, like most alternative shops, specializes in pop and rock. It is a  bright, airy room where the stereo plays loud and house plants sit atop the  record bins. The store's more eccentric albums are displayed along the walls  with accompanying notes of interest:  </P> <P> "The Best of Michael Jackson" has a $100 price tag because of some scribbles  across the jacket. "Autographed (pre nose-change)," the note says. "Try getting  his autograph now."  </P> <P> Billy Joel's "Cold Spring Harbor" sells for $30. The note reads: "Billy says  about this album, 'Slow down your turntable because when I went from tape to  acetate the machine that does that was screwed up, so it came out a quarter  note higher than I recorded it.' And he's right, y'know. Sounds funny."  </P> <P> Jimmy Gordon's "Hog Fat," priced at $15, comes with this explanation: "This guy  was in Derek &amp; the Dominos. He's now in jail for murdering his mom! Looks  like the type, doesn't he?"  </P> <P> Across town at the Record Collector in Hollywood, the atmosphere is musty and  quiet -- no music playing. Fourteen-foot-tall bookcases line the walls in  several rooms. Classical, opera, jazz and sound tracks are stored with only the  spine of the record showing.  </P> <P> Owner Sandy Chase says his shop "is like an old, rare bookstore where the owner  knows every line ever written."  </P> <P> "When you need to find a needle in the haystack," he said, "we can find that  needle."  </P> <P> The shop, like others of its kind, survives on a cadre of loyal customers. Only  a few of Los Angeles' alternative record shops -- Rhino Records in Westwood,  Aron's in Hollywood, Moby Disc in Sherman Oaks and Canoga Park -- are as  well-known as the chain stores.  </P> <P> The rest rely on word-of-mouth advertising.  </P> <P> "If you have the good music, they find out about you," said Dan Alvino, who has  owned Music &amp; Memories in Sherman Oaks for 10 years.  </P> <P> Located in a strip mall above a 7-Eleven, Music &amp; Memories specializes in  sound tracks and bygone crooners. On a recent day, a teen-ager walked in, took  one look at the place -- Sinatra movie posters on the walls, pictures of  Marilyn and Bogart as well -- and left.  </P> <P> "I don't get many kids in here," Alvino said. "I don't carry Bruce  Springsteen."  </P> <P> But he does offer a full complement of Steve and Eydie, "tons of" Judy Garland  and a Sinatra section packed with 300 different albums.  </P> <P> "I had Mel Torme come into the store. He looked under his own section and said,  'You've got more of my records than I have,' " Alvino said. "He bought a  couple."  </P> <P> Alvino tests each record he buys, and he won't sell albums that are heavily  worn or scratched. Some alternative stores will, usually in the bargain bins.  Most let the customer listen to the record in the shop before buying it.  </P> <P> Maintaining an inventory of exotic, or simply old, albums isn't easy. The work  is best suited for avid music enthusiasts. Shop owners scour garage sales, swap  meets, thrift shops and record conventions in search of merchandise.  </P> <P> "You have to be constantly on the go, trying to beat the other guy to records,"  said Ernie Leal, who owns Sweet &amp; Lowe Music in North Hollywood. "You  always see people from other shops and you always say, 'Oh shoot, he beat me to  it.' "  </P> <P> During the 1967 Detroit riots, Bob Plotnik and a friend bought armfuls of rare  jazz records that he feared would be lost in the fires and looting.  </P> <P> "There we were, two white guys running around the neighborhood trying to save  the records," said Plotnik, who recently opened a Melrose Avenue version of his  Greenwich Village-based Bleecker Bob's Golden Oldies Record Shop. "When people  asked us what we were doing, we told them, 'We're trying to save the sounds.' "  </P> <P> The business is replete with such stories, and tales of fantastic finds. Alvino  found a single of Frank Sinatra singing "High Hopes" with special lyrics  written for John F. Kennedy's inauguration. He paid $1 for the record and sold  it for $300. Brown, at Ear Candy, bought a 1963 RCA sampler for 25 cents and,  upon returning to his shop, discovered that it included a rare Elvis Presley  cut that was worth $800.  </P> <P> "When you come across stuff like that," Brown said, "it makes it all  worthwhile."  </P> <P> Shopping at alternative record stores can be just as arduous, or at least more  difficult than dropping by a Sam Goody outlet to pick up Tiffany's latest.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I'll spend a couple hours looking to find what I want," said John  Hydo, 22, a record collector who was browsing through Ear Candy. "It's kind of  like a treasure hunt. I was at a store the other day and picked up the Beatles'  first album on the original label for only 94 cents."  </P> <P> The shop owner who sold that Beatles album must not have known that it was  worth more, Hydo said. Such is the lure of alternative stores -- the promise of  a bargain. Short of that, shoppers know they can find a wide selection.  </P> <P> "I don't think I've ever come in here without buying something," said John  Rowan of Huntington Beach, who is a regular at the Record Collector in Los  Angeles.  </P> <P> And the other day at Music &amp; Memories, Alvino pointed to a customer named  Chuck who was browsing through the bins.  </P> <P> "He collects Sinatra . . . everything," Alvino said. "If Sinatra hums, he wants  it."  </P> <P> Chuck looked up and smiled.  </P> <P> "Absolutely."  </P></p>

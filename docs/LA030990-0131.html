			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: GAY PICKETERS PROTEST ARREST OF BAR OWNER  </P> <P> More than 40 representatives of homosexual rights organizations picketed the  Van Nuys Courthouse on Thursday to protest what they claim was the  discriminatory arrest and prosecution of the owner of a Van Nuys gay bar.  </P> <P> The demonstration was on behalf of Frank J. Roedel, owner of the In Touch bar  at 5248 Van Nuys Blvd.  </P> <P> Roedel was arrested along with seven customers and three male exotic dancers in  a raid on the bar by Los Angeles vice officers Dec. 11, said Marty Vranicar,  head of the Van Nuys branch of the city attorney's office.  </P> <P> Police observed lewd conduct by the dancers and customers, Vranicar said. The  city attorney's office decided not to charge the customers and dancers, partly  because appellate courts have consistently held that exotic dancing is  protected by the First Amendment, Vranicar said.  </P> <P> But Roedel was charged with violating a section of the state Business and  Professions Code that prohibits running a disorderly establishment where liquor  is served, Vranicar said.  </P> <P> Wearing pink armbands, the demonstrators quietly watched as Commissioner  Rebecca Omens-Rochman postponed Roedel's trial until April 23 to allow him time  to change attorneys. The demonstrators contended that the bar is being singled  out because of its homosexual clientele.  </P> <P> If convicted, Roedel could be sentenced to a maximum of six months in jail and  a $1,000 fine, Vranicar said.  </P></p>

			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Resignation threatens Rabin peace drive: Minister quits over long-running corruption scandal THE Middle East peace drive by Israel's coalition government was threatened last night when Mr Arye Deri, the interior minister, resigned as a long-simmering corruption scandal came to a head. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, said the resignation of Mr Deri, who leads the ultra-orthodox Shas party, could harm the chance for peace. The threat to the Labour-led coalition came as the prime minister sent a message of encouragement to Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, who last night began a crucial meeting with his executive committee in Tunis to vote on the peace agreement and mutual recognition with Israel. According to a Palestinian source PLO and Israeli negotiators last night agreed on the wording of statements of mutual recognition, seen as one of the remaining obstacles to the deal. Mr Rabin said: 'We are ready to recognise them (the PLO) under certain conditions' - the first public confirmation by the prime minister that Israel would recognise its former enemy. The PLO wants to exchange statements on recognition before signing the peace agreement on Palestinian self-rule. Mr Deri's resignation came after a panel of high court judges ordered Mr Rabin to sack him, along with Mr Rafael Pinhasi, a fellow Shas politician who is deputy minister for religious affairs. Shas has six seats in the Knesset (parliament) and has been a vital centre-right coalition partner. Shas has not spelled out how it would respond to the resignation of Mr Deri, who is facing charges of fraud, misallocation of public funds, breach of public trust and diversion of Interior Ministry money to institutions run by his religious movement. The party could either replace the ministers or could quit government. If it left, Mr Rabin would be forced to reconstitute his coalition with other right-wing religious parties as he has pledged not to strike a peace deal at the head of a government relying solely on left-wing and Arab support. Other parties could demand concessions in domestic policy and in further peace negotiations. Political analysts say it is unlikely Shas would quit the government and surrender the benefits they can deliver to the ultra-orthodox Jewish community they represent. If they did leave the coalition they would probably support the peace agreement from the back benches. Once an agreement with the PLO is signed, Mr Rabin is expected to submit it to a free Knesset vote where, even without Shas, he has a 61-59 majority. With Shas and more votes from defectors the agreement is expected to win a substantial majority. Israel and Jordan have agreed tentatively on the framework for a peace treaty to settle borders and establish joint water, energy and environmental projects but progress in talks with Syria has slowed, Agencies report from Washington. Jordanian Ambassador Fayez Tarawneh said yesterday he hoped the deal could be finalised and announced after Israel and the PLO conclude their accord. 'It doesn't need any signature or any ceremonies,' he said. Visions of a grand Middle East signing ceremony, including an Israeli pact with Syria seemed to fade yesterday when a US official said simultaneous deals could be difficult and Syrian and Israeli negotiators gave gloomy reports of their talks, each blaming the other.</p>

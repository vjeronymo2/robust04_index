			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Arts: Socialism, and other old jokes - Television BBC2's new Thursday night series Pandora's Box has, according to its billing, a fascinating purpose: 'To explore the cultural impact of 20th century science' using 'archive clips from feature films, cartoons, and home movies'. Furthermore, the opening programme was fascinating in some ways, yet also deeply irritating because although it kept claiming to be about science and the failure of science, it was actually about socialism and the failure of socialism (or sometimes sociology and the failure of sociology). The trap which the programme dug for itself was clear from the start when we were told 'To those who began the revolution in Russia 75 years ago, science was a grand liberating force. They believed Karl Marx had discovered the scientific laws of society which they would now use to unlock the gates to a new world where everyone would be equal and free'. In that one paragraph science and politics have already been clumsily conflated, and semantically matters went downhill from there. The cynical might say that this seemed like the last gasp of the fellow traveller, desperately seeking to blame the dramatic failure of communism on poor old science: because Soviet engineers and technocrats were involved in the The Plan, and The Plan failed, science was blamed for the failure when it was actually state centralisation which was to blame. Even if you reject the cynical reaction you are left with the depressing willingness of this programme to make common cause with the current frightening movement towards anti-rationalism. It is one thing for Californian hippies and teenage greenies to raise a cacophony of eco-babble and 'new age' superstition, seeking to substitute astrology and aromatherapy for science (which, after all, simply means a rational approach to the unknown) but we expect something more level headed from BBC2 documentaries. * * * Among the '3,000 selections, old and new' in Everybody's Book Of Jokes on the shelf in my bathroom is this one: 'I've read so much about the evils of drinking that I've decided to give up reading'. That joke was told in the first edition of a new series of The Comedians on ITV on Tuesday last week. The cover of my edition of Everybody's Book Of Jokes says 'Retorts, Bulls, Jests, Rhymes, Conundrums, Anecdotes, &amp; Puns, London, Saxon &amp; Co, Cloth 6d, Leather 1s, 120th Thousand'. It was printed in 1890. * * * Those straws in the wind, identified here last week as the harbingers of the new, rougher age of market-driven competition in British television, keep on coming. This week we hear that Channel 4, the network for minorities, is to re-launch its breakfast show. And how will it fulfil that famous statutory requirement to 'be different'?  Will it differ from TV-am and BBC1 by concentrating on non-metropolitan material? No. Given television's current obsession with 'yoof', will it offer a service for the big and largely ignored growth area, the middle aged and elderly who have most of the disposable income that advertisers love? No. What then? The producer will be Charlie Parsons, late of that archetypal yoof series The Word, and the star presenters will be teen idol Bob Geldof and trendy yoof presenter Paula Yates, one-time Penthouse model and, of course, Geldof's wife. * * * Before that arrives some time in September, we shall be seeing the BBC's new soap opera, Eldorado. Though intended for the autumn season, this has been pulled forward to the first week in July in the hope, it is said, of avoiding it being swamped by all the other new autumn material. Not so long ago the BBC considered itself superior to the sort of broadcaster that used soap to pull down the big ratings.  Then, in 1985, came the twice weekly EastEnders, to be joined in 1988 by Neighbours, imported from Australia and shown twice every weekday.  Now here comes Eldorado, with its famous Pounds 10m price tag, shot in a purpose-built hamlet in Spain and due for transmission on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. This will take BBC1's soap output to 17 units a week and, if Eldorado is repeated, as seems likely, 20. Haystacks indeed. * * * Not all the conclusions in last week's column were borne out this week, however. C4's new topical comment series A Stab In The Dark (don't say satire or mention TW3 ) was considerably better second time round. David Baddiel even had a go at the tedium of feminist comedy, with its endless repetition of 'I just find male genitalia funny'.  After all the years of 'little willie' gags from this lot perhaps Baddiel could start a few about the vast capaciousness of feminist comics. * * * Time was when television drama meant either the single play or a good meaty serial running for 13 weeks or so. Now every broadcaster is said to want mini-series, so almost everything you see lasts for three or four hours. BBC1's Natural Lies, which ran across the last three Sunday evenings, lasted only 2 hours 45 minutes, but no doubt foreign broadcasters will strip it across the week in six half-hour slots, or over the weekend in two 90-minute slots. It was one of those 'Everyone's in league against me' stories with Bob Peck playing the man who, even with police, government departments, and old friends all conspiring, is determined to get to the bottom of things. 'Things' on this occasion were . . . well, very meaty actually: BSE got into the human food chain, and a man died. Before transmission there were protests from those with vested interests, but given the slight uncertainty about BSE developments in the long term it seemed a reasonable enough scare story; sometimes it is right to be scared. Not that it will stop me eating steak, though I might be put off if I had to see that glassy-eyed stare of agony from Peck again this year. * * * ITV's four-hour drama The Guilty was shown on successive nights, wrapped around News At 10. I find this system with its half-hour compulsory news break annoying even though I would usually watch the news. I prefer my drama uninterrupted. On such occasions the question is whether it is really worth setting up the VCR to record all four bits, given that, however careful you may be, some clown of a scheduler will ensure that one part, containing a crucial clue, will start early or end late and miss your tape. This time the story was of a boozy barrister (Michael Kitchen, world weary and excellent as ever) who rapes a new young secretary just before being created the youngest judge in the country; like so much recent television drama it left a sour taste in the mouth. However, Colin Gregg's direction showed the sort of flair for urban nightscapes that we have come to associate with modern French cinema thrillers. * * * What a wonderfully enjoyable South Bank Show this week on the making of the Beatles' 'Sgt Pepper' album. For some reason nothing in the world feels quite so nostalgically ancient as the music of your own youth, but the chief attraction of this programme was the extraordinarily detailed guided tour through the original master tapes by producer George Martin. This was an outstanding example of just how successful television can be at illustrating and analysing popular contemporary culture.</p>

			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> In watching the debut of KNBC's show, "Memories, Then and Now" (Sept. 15), I  found it biased in its portrayal of the segment showing teen idols of the past  and present. They did capture the prominent teen entertainers of the last three  decades, but they seem to have forgotten a significant group of the '70s, The  Jackson Five.  </P> <P> Lisa M.

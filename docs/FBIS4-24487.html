			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Cai Hong: "Qinghai Seeks Full Use of Local Resources"] </F>   [Text] Xining, Qinghai Province--Through international  cooperation, this land-locked province in northwest China is  determined to step up developing the rich resources hidden in  its snow-and-grass covered plateau.    As a first step, Qinghai will begin 28 projects exploiting  natural resources this year, according to Governor Tian  Chengping.    One of them is the second expansion stage of Qinghai Potash  Fertilizer Corporation, a key state project. It is expected to  get technical help from Israel.    The inland province has been trying hard to lure outside  investment. Although the efforts have been deterred by the  province's arid weather and craggy terrain, Qinghai had acquired  $430 million from 14 countries and regions by the end of 1993.  Funding has come from the United States, Japan, Australia, and  Hong Kong.    The local authorities expect that foreign investments and  overseas preferential loans to the province will total $200  million this year.    The provincial government plans to build hydropower stations  on the upper reaches of the Yellow River, opening up oil fields  and developing its abundant salt reserves.    The province has cooperated extensively with other parts of  the nation.    In building the huge Lijiaxia Hydropower Station, for  example, the province and its neighbours--Shaanxi, Gansu, and  Ningxia--are working together. They are sharing 20 percent of  the total investment of 3 billion yuan ($348 million) in the  station, which is expected to go into operation in 1996.    From 1988 through 1993, the province had signed 1,137  cooperative contracts with other parts of the nation, absorbing  384 million yuan ($45 million).    The province has also established 384 factories or offices  in  other parts of China. Qinghai, a province almost as large as  France and Britain combined, is lightly populated with 4.6  million people. But it contains 119 minerals of which 48,  including salt, oil, gold and nonferrous metals, are among the  nation's top 10 reserves.    The province is the source of the country's great rivers:  The Yangtze [Chiang Jiang], the Yellow, and the Lancang  (Mekong), and has abundant hydropower.</p>

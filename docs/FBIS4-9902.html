			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Adolfo Miranda Saenz] </F>   [Text] No one got an absolute majority in the Atlantic  Coast elections, but given the conditions, regardless of the  number of votes garnered by each candidate, the percentages  indicate that the big winner was the Constitutionalist Liberal  Party (PLC), and the big loser was the Sandinist National  Liberation Front (FSLN).    The Sandinists, having accumulated vast resources during the  years when they were in power, were unable to put in a strong  showing against the PLC, which was transformed from a small  party to a big adversary. It joined the fray on its own and  bravely fought to win a decent percentage, which is an  undeniable victory.    The FSLN may try to minimize the failure it suffered,  winning  such a small percentage in spite of all its power and resources.  But the fact remains that in comparison to the votes it  garnered, the PLC's percentage--won without joining the parties  that make up the National Opposition Union (UNO) or any other  liberal parties--suggests that if the liberals were to lead a  democratic alliance, they could defeat the FSLN in 1996.    The FSLN has been unable to recover from its electoral  defeat  of 25 February 1990 because it has been unable to correct its  mistakes. Its two main factions have said that they recognize  their errors, but no faction has come out and identified by name  those who committed abuses under Laws 85, 86, and 88. Nor is  there any talk of returning the ill-gotten gains, expelling  corrupt members, or fixing the blame for the government's  leading us into a chaos from which we have not yet emerged.    In other words, they have limited themselves to expressing  repentance, but only in words...while the fact is that they left  our country in ruins, with 50,000 dead, widows, orphans, blind  people, amputees, etc., plus the tragic fact that we have  regressed three decades in history, becoming the most backward  and impoverished country in the Americas.    On the Atlantic Coast, in contrast, people know that in  Managua a man accused of being a fascist, ultrarightist,  radical, mean, corrupt, and the embodiment of Somozism, as mayor  has carried out more development projects and accomplished more  for the people than the Sandinists and the current government  combined.    That is to say that everything the Sandinists and the  officials of the current government have said against Arnoldo  Aleman is nothing but words, in contrast to a man who has  responded with deeds. This situation leads me to the conclusion  that since Arnoldo Aleman poses a real political threat to them,  they have tried to push him out of the race by portraying him as  the most terrible thing on earth in order to discredit him.    But that tactic has not yielded any results, although I  confess that I, like others, believed them for a while. The  tactic of tarring a candidate as a Somozist to oust him from the  political arena did not work in 1990, but they did not learn  their lesson. The percentages obtained by the PLC in the  Atlantic Coast elections show that our people are not swayed by  mere words; they know how to evaluate deeds.    A mayor who can show visible accomplishments that cannot be  hidden or denied deserves respect. He has been able to  revitalize liberalism in a country where, not too long ago,  admitting to being a liberal was tantamount to pleading guilty  to a crime before the accusing finger of the "immaculate"  Sandinists, who have been very good at accusing and maligning  others, but incapable of being honestly and clearly critical of  their own corruption, beyond superficial and ambiguous words.    That is why the people held them accountable in the 1990  elections, and have just done so again in the 1994 elections on  the Atlantic Coast, even though they are celebrating their  "triumph" (?). The votes won by the PLC, added to those cast for  other non-Sandinist political groups, confirm that the FSLN is a  losing party whose image of failure will be difficult to shed  between now and 1996.    We liberals--all liberals--must acknowledge this triumph by  Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and the PLC, and must close ranks to form a  unified movement. This great effort by the PLC deserves our  support. Those Nicaraguans who do not want a return to Somozism  or the continuation of Sandinism in power should close ranks and  not fall into the trap of diluting our strength or discrediting  the mayor of Managua, blindly accepting the accusation that he  is a "Somozist," a well-worn ruse often employed by the  Sandinists.    The results of the Atlantic Coast elections, with the  undeniable liberal triumph of the PLC, should cause us to stop  and reflect and rethink our political strategy. The FSLN's  emphatic denunciation of Arnoldo Aleman should not prevent us  from supporting the PLC and the mayor of Managua. The FSLN has  Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and the PLC in its sights because it knows  that this force can defeat it at the head of a democratic  alliance.    Those of us who, without being Sandinist militants, at one  time supported the FSLN, without asking or getting anything in  return because we were doing it for Nicaragua's sake, have the  most right to demand redress for the harm they did and the  deception they perpetrated. We also have the right to demand  that they drop their aggressive and derogatory remarks about  other politicians whom they accuse of corruption, because those  "corrupt" people have shown by their deeds--not their  words--that they are better than the Sandinists. As the old  saying goes, people who live in glass houses should not throw  stones.</p>

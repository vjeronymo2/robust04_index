			<p><P> February 28, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE GETS GOOD MILEAGE FROM LONG DRIVES, 7-6  </P> <P> Were it not for the bright red jersey with his name and number printed on the  back, Jody Garcia could have been mistaken for a statue.  </P> <P> Garcia, the left fielder for the Chapman College baseball team, spent much of  Tuesday's game against Cal State Northridge with his hands frozen upon his  knees -- movement being unnecessary as four Matador home runs sailed over his  head, and the fence, at Hart Park in Orange.  </P> <P> Scott Sharts provided two of the blasts and Mike Solar and Denny Vigo added one  each as the Matadors powered past Chapman, 7-6.  </P> <P> Northridge improved to 9-6 overall, 4-1 in California Collegiate Athletic Assn.  play. Chapman is 8-7, 1-2.  </P> <P> "I feel like I did back in high school," said Sharts, who set a Southern  Section record with 32 homers at Simi Valley. "It's going my way and I like  it."  </P> <P> Sharts' first home run came in the fourth inning. The solo shot off starter  Dave Paveloff was his eighth home run of season and gave the Matadors a 1-0  lead.  </P> <P> Northridge was behind, 4-3, in the eighth when Sharts blasted a three-run shot  off Paveloff (3-3).  </P> <P> "I thought they were going to bring a new guy in or do something like put me  on," Sharts said. "I really didn't expect to get anything in the zone, but he  hung a slider."  </P> <P> Vigo, the next batter, chased Paveloff with another homer, his sixth. It proved  to be the game-winner because Chapman rallied for two runs.  </P> <P> Sophomore right-hander Craig Clayton allowed four runs and 10 hits in seven  innings to earn the victory and improve his record to 4-1. Clayton also struck  out seven and walked only one.  </P> <P> Vale Lopez stalled a two-run Chapman rally in the ninth to earn his first save.  </P> <P> After Sharts' first homer, Chapman tied the score in the home half of the  fourth on a single by Doug Yates that scored Tom Allison from third.  </P> <P> Northridge went ahead, 3-1, on Solar's first home run, a two-run shot in the  fifth that drove in Kyle Washington.  </P> <P> Chapman regained the lead with a three-run seventh that was keyed by Garcia's  two-run triple to the right-field corner.  </P> <P> That set the stage for the Matadors' rally in the eighth.  </P> <P> Eric Johnson started it with one-out double, Clayton kept it going by reaching  first on an error and Sharts and Vigo finished it with their back-to-back  homers.  </P> <P> Chapman added two runs in the ninth on a run-scoring double by Allison and a  wild pitch by Lopez.  </P></p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Management: Why Shakespeare was wrong about names William Shakespeare was only half right when he wrote Juliet's famous declaration of love for Romeo: 'What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.' He was right in that people's names seldom matter much - although one wonders if a well-bred modern Juliet would fall as easily for a Wayne. But in most other senses he was wrong. The names of most objects - including flowers - have distinct meanings, or develop them over time. Would Juliet have felt as enraptured by an equally sweet-smelling blossom called, say, stinkwort? Shakespeare's half-bloomer has come to mind repeatedly over the past few weeks as I have inspected a steady flow of readers' replies to my appeal for a more stylish name for that fashionable but misleading concept, the 'horizontal organisation'. For those who missed the column which sparked the correspondence (Nov 5), a short word of explanation is required. My complaint was partly that the idea of horizontal, hierarchy-less organisations has been extolled for years by academics and consultants, without anyone being precise about what it means. I also inveighed against the misleading - or, at least, over-optimistic - way in which some people are now starting to slap the term onto actual companies, such as Motorola, Texas Instruments and AT&amp;T. It is true that, through process re-engineering and other measures, various units within these organisations are being redesigned with relatively flat hierarchies. This changes, to some extent, their lines of responsibility and communication. Traditionally, these were vertical: they ran up and down particular departments, or 'functions', as they are often known in management-speak. Instead, to a considerable degree - but not entirely - they now run laterally across former departmental boundaries. But this does not make such organisations horizontal, in the complete sense of the word, any more than Wayne is identical with Romeo, or stinkwort with rose. Almost all of them retain some degree of hierarchy and functional structure. It would be accurate to describe them as 'mixed', 'hybrid', 'differentiated' or perhaps 'process-managed'. Accurate, but both vague and awful. Hence my appeal for sensible but stylish improvements. Some of my correspondents had a field day. One humorous fellow was too smart by half: he suggested 'legless', on the grounds that it conveyed not only the sense of 'elimbinated' (sic) organisational legs (departments), but also the horizontal state of consultants who have no leg to stand on. Get it? He also suggested 'disvertical'. Does he call that stylish? He did rather better with 'the Barnet organisation', as in the English soccer team of that name. As he said, 'there's no flatter team in the Football League than Barnet FC' Soccer metaphors also arrived aplenty from the Belgian city of Liege, in the form of 'football team', 'free-flowing' and 'wave-effect' organisations. Good tries, but hardly precise or inspiring. Then there was the partner of one of the world's leading accounting firms, who proposed 'para-functional', meaning beyond functional. I have news for him: the term is neither stylish nor clear. In my dictionaries, 'para' is used to mean 'beside' (as in paramedic) far more often than 'beyond' (as in paranormal). A sceptic about the viability of anything resembling a horizontal organisation came up with 'managerially disadvantaged'. That is certainly stylish, but not necessarily accurate. Leaving aside a number of other contributions, the most thoughtful letters came from a professor of auditing, a management researcher, and a consultant. The professor got closest to the mark with his suggestion of 'team-driven'. He argued that 'process-managed' or any other term including the word 'managed', is suggestive of hierarchy, whereas the key characteristic of any degree of horizontalism is teamwork. But 'team-driven' does not convey the full sense required. For one thing, not all teams operate across departments, which is one of the key characteristics of a horizontal organisation. The researcher's contribution was a very thoughtful essay on the dangers to western managers of wavering between opposites: not just horizontal vs vertical, but also group vs individual, authority vs autonomy, competition vs collaboration, and so on. What makes Japanese companies special, he suggested, is their ability to embrace, even integrate, these opposites, so that elements of them can be applied as needed. As a frequent exponent of the principle of ambiguity and paradox in management, I agree with him. As he argued, it would be folly to advocate that all organisations be either completely vertical or horizontal: many should be mixed. But, as he also said, this does not mean that terms such as 'hybrid' are adequate. Apart from their awkwardness, they are abstract: they beg the question of what 'hybrid' actually consists of. He ended up in the same camp as the consultant, who argued rightly that different types of organisation are needed for different purposes: 'horizontal' and flexibly project-based for architects and custom ship-builders; vertical and highly structured for companies which churn out thousands of standard jam jars. The consultant's conclusion was that 'it doesn't matter what it's called - it's what it does that's important'. That, although a trifle less poetic, was exactly Shakespeare's misguided point. As a firm believer in the motivating, often inspirational, power of language, I still beg to differ with him. I shall continue my name-hunt, even if it renders me horizontal in the process.</p>

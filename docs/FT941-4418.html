			<p>940311 FT  11 MAR 94 / 700,000 school places face axe Mr John Patten yesterday stepped into a fierce row over the extent of excess capacity in schools by saying that up to 700,000 surplus places could be eliminated 'very quickly' at a saving of more than Pounds 200m. The education secretary's claim - which comes as local elections loom - was dismissed by the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities. Mr Patten's figures were meaningless, it said, and seven councils that had presented the Department for Education with plans to rationalise and remove surplus places had been thwarted by delays in decisions. Mr Graham Lane, the AMA's education spokesman, said Mr Patten had 'made a lot of noise about the need to remove surplus places', but added: 'The evidence shows that our members are doing their best whilst his own department is dragging its feet.' Mr Patten said that from next month, when the new Funding Agency for Schools starts to operate, he would urge local authorities in England and Wales to 'squeeze surplus school places out of the system'. Any that failed to respond would find the job done for them by the new agency. Questioned at a Westminster press conference, Mr Patten said money being spent on 'roofs for half-used buildings' should be earmarked instead for teachers, the national curriculum and for books. The government's aim was to 'concentrate management and teaching effort on the children, not on the buildings'. He said that 'an awful lot of places' could be removed by withdrawing parts of buildings from use. But Mr Patten offered no assurance that the money saved would remain in the education service and would not be clawed back by the Treasury. His remarks prompted a call from Labour for surplus places to be used to 'make a start on providing universal nursery education'. Mrs Ann Taylor, shadow education secretary, said: 'Taking powers to produce a hit-list of schools which are to face closure is not the most productive way forward.' The Audit Commission, which monitors local government spending, said it was concerned by surplus places, but could not provide an authoritative figure. It told councils to consider amalgamating schools' sixth forms into sixth-form colleges. However, Mr Patten is now encouraging schools that teach pupils aged 11 to 16 to open their own sixth forms.</p>

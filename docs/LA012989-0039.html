			<p><P> January 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOTEBOOK: SHAIN'S DOESN'T LIKE THE SOUND OF SHANE'S -- AND SUES  </P> <P> Gerard Izard and Michael Kurland thought they'd found the perfect name for  their Beverly Glen hilltop restaurant. "We named it Shane, after the famous  Alan Ladd movie," Izard said, "partly because we were going to do Southwestern  food and partly as kind of a joke, because at the end of the movie, the boy  calls, 'Come back, come back' -- and we thought, well, maybe people will come  back here."  </P> <P> What they say they didn't know at the time was that there was already another  Shain's, albeit with a different spelling, not far away in Sherman Oaks. If you  were to walk into the two restaurants, you could see right away that the two  are not related: The Bel-Air Shane's, designed by Barbara Lazaroff of Spago and  Chinois on Main fame, serves Southwestern specialties with an Italian accent  (or maybe vice versa), and has quickly become famous for its high-powered  Spago-style celebrity clientele. On the other hand, Shain's in Sherman Oaks,  run by restaurateur Don Shain, is a Continental restaurant that has been in  operation for eight years.  </P> <P> These differences in both spelling and concept haven't stopped Don Shain from  worrying that people in the area are mixed up about the two restaurants. He has  filed suit against the owners of Shane. (The full name is Shane Hidden on the  Glen.) According to Jane Harman of Freeman &amp; Sutton, the public relations  agency that represents Shain's, the suit "claims that Shane chose the  same-sounding name with the intent and result of creating confusion among the  Ventura Boulevard restaurant's customers and potential customers as to a  possible connection between the two eateries." Don Shain, Harman continued,  "seeks not only an injunction against the continued use of the name Shane, but  substantial monetary damages as well."  </P> <P> "We were very surprised to hear about the suit," Izard responded. "At the time  (we named the restaurant), we didn't even know that this other place existed."  Izard said that he plans to fight the suit, "because we think we're right."  </P> <P> "Besides," Izard added, "we don't even have the same area code."  </P> <P> SERPENTS WITH A SMILE: By the Chinese way of reckoning, Monday, Feb. 6 is New  Year's Day -- the beginning of the year 4687, or the Year of the Serpent.  Previous serpent years this century have been 1905, 1917, 1929, 1941, 1953 and  1965; famous recent Snake people have included Greta Garbo, Princess Grace and  both John F. Kennedy and Jacqueline Onassis. As usual, a number of local  Chinese restaurants plan special banquets to celebrate the holiday. Among  these, Tse Yang in Los Angeles serves a lavish $45 per-person prix-fixe dinner  Feb. 6-9. . . . King Dragon in Beverly Hills asks $35 a head for its New Year's  feast served Feb. 5-6 (and with six you get roast suckling pig). . . . Hoy Toy  in Sherman Oaks starts early and continues late, offering its own New Year's  banquet, priced at $25 per couple, Feb 3-14. . . . And Madame Wu in Santa  Monica offers a traditional Peking Snake, er, Duck dinner for $29.95 per person  Feb. 6-8.  </P> <P> WINING AND DINING: Gilliland's in Santa Monica matches Italian food with the  wines of Flora Springs at a special dinner at 6 tonight for $55 per person. . .  . Cafe Pierre in Manhattan Beach features wines from Trefethen and a  five-course menu tomorrow, at $45 a head. . . . If you want to make it three in  a row, Floreale in the Ramada Renaissance Hotel in Long Beach pours McDowell  Valley wines with a six-course dinner on Tuesday. Tariff is $55.  </P></p>

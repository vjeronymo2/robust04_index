			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Arts: Merce Cunningham Dance Company When Merce Cunningham, in the 1950s, began using chance procedures such as dice-rolling and coin-tossing to structure his dances, he was trying to return to the essence of dancing, movement itself. In his view, the conventional ways of structuring a dance - making it tell a story, making it illustrate a musical score - obscured the dancing by bending it to the service of something foreign. As long as the sweep of an arm was dictated by some other necessity, it was less a sweep, less an arm. Hence Cunningham's conversion to chance. If, in deciding how many dancers to put on the stage or where a given section of the dancing should fall, he rolled the dice and let the dice decide, he could short-circuit the mind's sentimentalities and, he hoped, produce something like Pure dance, with all its bright edges. He has had his wish. Cunningham has now been choreographing for 50 years, and the most striking characteristic of his work, aside from its formal beauty, is its objectivity. No dancing on the American stage today is freer of sentimental pretension. Cunningham's dancers move like animals: straightforward, unselfconscious. And, by a familiar paradox, this objectivity gives them a huge subjective force. Just as landscape painting can sometimes turn up human truths, so Cunningham's dancers, darting about like birds or fish, evoke states of the soul. Actually, Cunningham's dances often seem like landscapes. They have that mood - contemplative. A beautiful example is Loosestrife, one of the three new dances presented during the Cunningham company's recent season at New York's City Center. Named after a species of wildflower, Loosestrife is a quiet piece in which the dancers seem to communicate in a special, hidden language. One dancer (the lovely, coltish Larissa McGoldrick) does a long solo, and five others sit and watch. Two dancers perform a duet while another (the superb Victoria Finlayson) encircles them with a string of dainty little leaps, like a golden chain. In most Cunningham works entrances are very important, but never more so than in Loosestrife. Again and again one dancer will leave and another enter as several remain dancing on the stage. When this happens, the very air seems altered by the new person's arrival. In fact, the person may have entered quite unobtrusively, but this is Cunningham's gift - to magnify movement, to turn his stage into a world and then make the whole world seem to change when someone walks in. The two other new works, Change of Address and Beach Birds, were both marked by a rather strange mix of greater literalism and greater obscurity than one is used to seeing in Cunningham. In Beach Birds, danced to a score by John Cage, the dancers seemed actually to represent birds. They balanced on one leg like storks; they spread their arms like wings. Later in the dance, however, the bird metaphor was unceremoniously abandoned. The dancers began making thick, twisted moves and laying black-gloved hands on one another's white legs in a manner that was distinctly at odds with the sunrise-over-the-archipelago mood of the opening. All three new pieces, furthermore, were heavily loaded with what seemed gratuitously awkward movements. Many people have noted that Cunningham's work has become more freighted with emotion in the last decade. In 1990 Cunningham started using a computer as an aid in composing his dances. These two opposing developments may account for the oddly literal and oddly counterliteral quality of the new works. Thesis, antithesis. One looks forward to the synthesis.

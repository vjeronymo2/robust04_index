			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: URINATION 'SPELL' CONJURES UP LIFE BANS FOR 4 SOCCER PLAYERS  </P> <P> Soccer officials in Zimbabwe banned four members of the army's first division  Tongogara side for life after they urinated in front of several thousand  spectators at a stadium in eastern Zimbabwe Sunday.  </P> <P> Nelson Chirwa of the Zimbabwe Football Assn. said the players were practicing  tribal witchcraft in an attempt to change their side's fortunes. It was losing,  1-0.  </P> <P> "I would like to advise all football teams that next time they should go to a  better witch doctor," Chirwa said.  </P> <P> The Tongogara players probably agree. Their spell failed, 2-0.  </P> <P> Trivia time: What jockey won the first three runnings of the Hollywood Gold  Cup?  </P> <P> Marching on their stomachs: San Francisco running back Roger Craig was on the  bench in the fourth quarter of the 49ers' 45-3 victory over the Atlanta Falcons  after having rushed for nearly 100 yards. The 49er offensive linemen asked  Coach George Seifert to put Craig back in the game; Craig has a deal with his  linemen that if he gains more than 100 yards, he will buy them dinner. Craig  finished with 109 yards.  </P> <P> Trivia answer: George Woolf, aboard Seabiscuit in 1938, Kayak II in 1939 and  Challedon in 1940.  </P> <P> Rematch is off: Steve McCarthy has withdrawn from his rematch with Steve Wilson  scheduled for tonight in Reading, England. McCarthy, who has the flu, was to  have fought Tony Wilson in a rematch of their light-heavyweight fight in  September that was halted when Wilson's mother, Minna, climbed into the ring  and hit McCarthy with a high-heeled shoe.  </P> <P> Quotebook: Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka, on the crowd-inciting antics of  Green Bay Packers linebacker Tim Harris: "Sometimes, God gives you physical  talent and takes away the brain."

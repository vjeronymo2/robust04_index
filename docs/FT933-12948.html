			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Major in last plea to Maastricht rebels: Speaker tells courts not to interfere with rights of Commons over treaty MR JOHN MAJOR will today stake his political authority on a last-ditch plea to Conservative Eurosceptics to end the party's year-long civil war over Maastricht by voting against the treaty's social chapter. But last night the outcome of today's crucial House of Commons debate on the treaty remained uncertain, with both sides claiming enough votes to ensure victory when MPs troop into the Commons lobbies at 10pm. The tortuous ratification process also took another extraordinary twist when Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House of Commons, delivered a sharp warning to the courts not to interfere in the proceedings of the House. In a statement in response to representations from Labour MP Mr Tony Benn about the court action against Maastricht ratification launched by Lord Rees-Mogg, she strongly defended the sovereignty of parliament. Citing the 1689 Glorious Revolution's Bill of Rights, she said she took 'with great seriousness' any questioning in the courts of proceedings in the Commons. Her comments strengthened expectations at Westminster that the courts are likely to throw out the challenge which begins in the High Court next week. As party managers counted pledges, the bald arithmetic appeared still to point to a government defeat in the Commons vote. Underlining the expected closeness of the vote, Mr Major last night met potential Tory rebels individually to persuade them to fall into line. About a dozen Tory Eurosceptics said they were committed to join the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties in voting for an opposition amendment which would prevent ratification unless and until the government accepted the social chapter. Up to a dozen more said they planned to abstain rather than support the government in the hope that a Labour victory would derail the ratification process. Those figures suggested that unless he makes a deal to win the support of the nine Ulster Unionists before tonight's vote, Mr Major's majority of 18 will be wiped out. But speculation that the government would do such a deal intensified last night when Mr Major raised the possibility of negotiating a successor to the Anglo-Irish agreement. Senior ministers also took comfort from a handful of defections from the Eurosceptic camp, suggesting that, as on a previous occasion last autumn, the rebellion might crumble in the final hours before the vote. The best that more dispassionate Westminster insiders could offer was a 'hunch' that Mr Major would scrape through, drawing a line under the most bitter battle in modern parliamentary history. That impression was reinforced by a public display of studied calm among Tory party managers and ministers, suggesting that they are confident of victory. But ministers warned that the government would press ahead with ratification even if defeated. Mr Major will open today's debate with a warning that the imposition in Britain of the social chapter would wreck hopes of an economic recovery. He will follow that with a plea for loyalty at a private meeting of the backbench 1922 committee just hours before the Commons vote.

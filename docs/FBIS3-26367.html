The conference  relayed the important instructions issued by the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau Standing Committee on strengthening  judicial and public security work and the important speeches  given by Comrades Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Ren Jianxin at the  national public security and judicial conference. Cao Hongming,  deputy secretary of the provincial party committee and secretary  of the provincial Commission on Politics and Law, delivered a  work report. Yu Xingde, vice governor and deputy secretary of  the provincial commission, chaired the conference.    Cao Hongming began his report by analyzing the current  situation on the province's judicial and public security front.  He pointed out: At present, the province enjoys political and  social stability, which has served as an important guarantee for  the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and economic  construction. However, closer attention must still be paid to  problems in public order. A total of 69,846 criminal cases  occurred in the province last year, an increase of 6.7 percent  over the previous year. Of the total number, 22,257 involved  major crimes. As new structures replace the old and as the  volumes of personnel, monetary, and property exchanges expand,  factors contributing to violations of law and crimes have also  notably increased. In the current new situation of reform,  opening up, and accelerated economic construction, we must bring  into full play the role of judicial and public security work in  safeguarding and serving our cause. Judicial and public  security work must be strengthened; it must not be weakened.    Cao Hongming pointed out: Our major public security and  judicial tasks in 1994 are: Using Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and  the "Decision" of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee as guide, and taking into consideration the  requirements for building a socialist market economic structure,  we shall earnestly strengthen and reform judicial and public  security work; augment the functions of the people's democratic  dictatorship; resolutely crack down on the sabotage activities  of hostile forces and elements as well as on serious criminal  and economic offenses; implement measures for comprehensively  tackling problems of public order in an all-around way; and  strengthen the building of the public security and judicial  ranks to effectively safeguard and serve, through the use of  law, the construction and perfection of our socialist market  economy and create a favorable social environment for the  sustained, rapid, and healthy development of Jiangsu's economy.    Cao Hongming stressed: We must continue to maintain the  strong momentum of the struggle launched in various localities  to sternly and expeditiously punish serious criminal elements in  accordance with the law. We must direct the primary spearhead  of the struggle at major criminals who have a very bad influence  on society, such as murderers, robbers, hooligans, rapists,  kidnappers who cruelly harm their hostages, and burglars; and at  violent and organized crimes, particularly those committed by  underworld figures, gangs, and local criminal forces, which pose  serious threats to public security. We must resolve every  prominent problem of public order as soon as it appears; we must  not allow it to become uncontrollable. We must deepen the  struggle against corruption by concentrating on major,  high-profile cases. We must investigate all corruption cases  through to the end, regardless of the persons involved. We must  correctly deal with contradictions within the ranks of people in  the new situation, deepen investigation and research, and carry  out ideological-political work with a clear objective in mind.    Cao Hongming pointed out: We must further mobilize all  social forces, strengthen grass-roots work, and implement  measures for comprehensively tackling problems of public order  in an all-around way. We must strengthen population management  with a clear objective in mind, intensify management and control  of the social aspects of urban and rural activities, further  improve crime prevention and control by the masses, strengthen  traffic and fire prevention management, establish and perfect a  leadership responsibility system to comprehensively tackle  problems of public order, and earnestly implement the policy  under which a leader is responsible for maintaining public order  in areas under his jurisdiction.    Cao Hongming urged principal responsible comrades of the  party and government at various levels in the province to devote  more energy to judicial and public security work. He said:  Responsible leaders should attend to specific work to  strengthen guidance and inspection. Other leading comrades in  different work posts should also concern themselves with  judicial and public security work. Vigorous efforts should be  made to improve the overall standards and fighting capacity of  our public security and judicial ranks. A general drive to  educate public security and judicial cadres and police in the  goal of serving the people and building a clean government, and  in the legal system should be launched to truly raise their  ideological-political standards.    Dai Guangzhen, deputy director of the provincial party  committee's Organization Department, gave a speech on  implementing the leadership responsibility system to  comprehensively tackle problems of public order.    More than 200 people attended the conference, including  members of the provincial party committee's Commission on  Politics and Law and Committee for Comprehensive Management of  Public Security; responsible comrades of city and county party  committees in charge of judicial and public security work; and  responsible comrades of other relevant provincial and city  departments.</p>

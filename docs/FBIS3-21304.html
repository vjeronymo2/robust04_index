He added, in a statement to AL-HAYAH, that Libya would take  steps to attract this liquidity (partly savings) into the  channels of the banking system to prevent a drop in the exchange  rate of the Libyan dinar, and to provide the liquidity needed to  support projects the authorities have decided to undertake.    He views a rise in the interest rate as a major means of  attracting these savings, saying that the new interest rate  would exceed the 9 percent currently payable on savings deposits.    The Libyan official revealed that his country had resorted  to  an "open exchange policy" (without the security of financial  backing) following the 24 percent decline in its revenues during  1993, compared to the previous year, in which foreign currency  revenues were nearly LD2.4 billion.    He said that allocations for the various sectors had  decreased and that the open exchange rate had not exceeded 3  percent of total revenues. He explained that there were great  risks in this policy for the exchange rate of the Libyan  currency and the economic situation.    Zulaytini believes that the reform of the economic system in  Libya could occur through the implementation of policies to hold  the budget deficit to the lowest possible level. He said that  this could happen through a high-interest public bond issue, the  allocation of a budget item to service the public debt, and the  avoidance of borrowing except for productive projects.  <H5>  Checks and Cash </H5>   He called on the Libyan people not to deal in cash, but to  deposit it in the banking system, so that the use of checks  might take the place of cash, with the aim of reducing supply.  He confirmed the need to collect Libya's foreign debts,  estimated at nearly $2.1 billion and 22 million French francs.  He emphasized the settlement of these debts in cash or in kind,  and cautioned that his country would resort to legal means to  get its money back from abroad should the debtor countries  procrastinate.    He said that halting the smuggling of Libyan dinars abroad  was the responsibility of security and customs at the various  frontier points. He called for the strengthening of monitoring  of currency flight, and of abiding by a law criminalizing it.    He added that the Libyan Central Bank's investment revenues  in foreign commercial banks in 1992 amounted to nearly LD4  million, and explained that the Central Bank was going to review  domestic housing loans, which are about 15,000 dinars [each].    He spoke of Libyans who postponed marriage due to the  scarcity of gold in their country, as the result of the  UN-imposed sanctions.    He alluded to the drop in his country's gold imports, to  between $17-$20 million, in the framework of limiting foreign  expenditures.</p>

			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PREVIN-FLEISCHMANN CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Bernheimer is at his brilliant best when he asks the basic question: Who should  be the director of the Philharmonic -- a world-famous  conductor-composer-performer or an autocrat who doesn't even hold an MBA degree  ("Previn Wanted to Run the Philharmonic -- So Does Fleischmann," April 26)? If  anyone is to go, it should be Fleischmann.  </P> <P> CHARLOTTE GEORGI  </P> <P> Culver City  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The European Commission began another antidumping  procedure against importers from the Czech Republic. This time  the procedure concerns foundry pig iron.    Relevant bodies of the Czech Foreign Ministry have not yet  received any official notification about the procedure. The  Czech Republic's permanent mission at the European Union  immediately protested against the Commission's one-sided  approach, asked for information necessary to discuss specific  trade instances, and said that the aim was to find a solution  acceptable to both sides.    This is only the third instance of anti-dumping procedure  against Czech importers since 1991. However, over the last  two-months period this is the second instance following  accusations levelled against Czech exporters of cement.</p>

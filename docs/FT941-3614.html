			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee surges on cut in Brazilian crop estimate Coffee futures prices surged through the Dollars 1,300-a-tonne level in London yesterday after the US Department of Agriculture revised its forecast of Brazil's 1994-95 crop downwards by nearly 1m bags. The second position robusta futures contract reached its highest closing level since last September, ending at Dollars 1,305, up Dollars 30 on the day and just Dollars 2 below the day's high. Technical buying in London was accompanied by interest from investment funds and the market remained buoyant after a strong start in New York. 'It's gone from strength to strength and hasn't looked back,' said one trader. In early afternoon trading in New York the second position arabica futures contract was up 2.45 at 81.25 cents a pound. The boost to an already bullish market came from the USDA's downward revision of the Brazilian crop from 24.3m bags (60kg each) to 23.5m bags. GNI, the London broker, said the USDA's figures were usually about 4m bags higher than Brazilian estimates because it used a much higher figure for local demand. 'However, this should mean that the local consensus will fall and a crop of 19m to 20m bags should be expected,' it said in its daily commodity report. One analyst said the USDA figures provided further encouragement to a market buoyed by signs of smaller crops in Colombia and across Central America, as illustrated by lower shipments in the four months since the start of the crop year last October. 'Everyone's pleased,' he said. 'It adds a bit more support to the coffee world, which has been through so many rough periods.' The other positive fundamental factor has been the relatively smooth running of the export retention scheme which came into operation in October in most coffee-producing countries in an attempt to shore up prices.</p>

			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Observer: Showtime Brazil's diplomats are facing increasing difficulty matching their beleaguered President Fernando Collor's appetite for foreign travel - 18 foreign trips in 2 1/2 years - with countries still keen to receive him. However, Observer hears that Collor is insisting on putting in an appearance at the UN general assembly in three weeks time. By tradition Brazil provides the first speaker in the general debate and while Collor could have sent his foreign minister, his absence from the international stage would not have looked good back home. In the event the UN's diplomatic gossips cannot help noting that the first speech at the general assembly will be given by a president facing impeachment, while the second speech will be given by a US president facing defeat.</p>

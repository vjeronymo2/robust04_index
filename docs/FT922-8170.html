			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Brussels approves energy tax to fight global warming THE European Commission yesterday approved its controversial draft directive to tax energy to combat global warming. EC figures indicate that the tax would have its biggest impact on industry and power station operators. It would result in a rise in the price of petrol and diesel fuel by the year 2000 of 6 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner, hailed yesterday's action as 'a historical turning point'. But the Commission made the introduction of the tax conditional on the US and Japan adopting similar measures to curb carbon dioxide emissions. This prompted claims by environmentalists that Brussels had all but shelved the measure. However, Mr di Meana warned that if the US rejected consideration of a similar strategy at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in three weeks' time, the EC might press ahead with a modified version of the tax. Mr Ripa di Meana said the Commission proposal was revolutionary: 'This is the first time price and market instruments have been incorporated for the defence of the environment in such an extensive manner.' If approved and applied by the 12, the tax would start at Dollars 3 a barrel of oil equivalent in 1993, rising Dollars 1 a year to reach Dollars 10 a barrel in 2000, by when the EC is committed to stabilising CO emissions at 1990 levels. The levy would fall half on the fuel content of all non-renewable energy and half on its carbon content, and would be balanced by tax reductions in other areas. Brussels reckons that economic growth would be affected only marginally, dropping by between 0.04 and 0.2 per cent a year under the full tax, with additional price rises of between 0.3 and 0.5 per cent a year. The draft directive seeks to protect the competitive position of European industry if the EC's partners fail to introduce similar measures. These include exemptions for energy-intensive industries such as chemicals, steel, cement and paper. In addition, member states in particular economic difficulties could reduce the tax level, and/or get EC funding to help them implement it. The safeguards were intended by Mr Ripa di Meana to enable the EC to go ahead unilaterally. Now, however, the decision to await the response of a US administration which has ruled out fiscal means to fight the build-up of greenhouse gases, appears to have handed Washington the power to veto the EC going ahead. The tax as framed should now get endorsement in principle from the 12 at the council of environment ministers on May 26.

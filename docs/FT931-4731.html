			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell pensions to be paid from Cuckney fund THE charitable trust chaired by Sir John Cuckney will step in to meet payments to the Maxwell pensioners once the government's Pounds 2.5m 'drip-feed' emergency fund runs out. It is expected to run out next month. The Cuckney fund, collected from businesses that had dealings with the Maxwell companies, is to step in because trustees for the Mirror Group Pension scheme are blocking a proposal that would allow Maxwell pensioners to start drawing monthly payments on the Pounds 188m Common Investment Fund which holds the assets of all four schemes. The trustees for the four Maxwell schemes have to agree on the basis of distribution from the fund before any scheme can receive money. While MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners welcome the intervention by the Pounds 6m Cuckney fund, they are becoming increasingly impatient with the delay in reaching an agreement which would allow initial payments to be made from the Common Investment Fund. 'It is good news for the pensioners that Sir John Cuckney has raised this money, but appalling news that there have still not been allocations from the Common Investment Fund,' Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead and chairman of the cross-party Commons social security committee, said yesterday. The trustees of the pension schemes have been summoned to answer questions from the committee, and are likely to appear late next month. MPs fear that using the Cuckney fund to make payments before the CIF is allocated will mean that there is less available for the schemes which get little or nothing from the final allocation. The Maxwell pensioners also expressed concern. Mr Kenneth Trench of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action Group said: 'This move simply shows an uncaring government turning its back on its moral responsibility to help the pensioners. It means that Pounds 6m-worth of charitable funds meant to relieve hardship are to be used unfairly.'</p>

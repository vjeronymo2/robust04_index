			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Truck sales up 50% this year Recovery in the UK truck market is proving stronger than expected with demand running at an annual rate 50 per cent higher than at the end of last year, according to industry estimates. Sales and orders are running at an annualised 50,000 for trucks over 3.5 tonnes, compared with 33,000 this time last year, according to truck market leader Iveco-Ford and second-placed Leyland DAF Trucks. Their estimates are supported by statistics from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders which show strong rises last month in light commercial vehicle as well as truck registrations. Coupled with SMMT figures published earlier this week showing another rise in business car purchases, the statistics provide evidence of increasing economic activity - while leaving the motor industry to seek other explanations for a slump in new car purchases by private motor-ists. According to SMMT statistics new registrations of trucks over 3.5 tonnes jumped 43.7 per cent in November, to 4,905 compared with 3,414 in the same month a year ago. They lifted registrations for this year's first 11 months to 41,473, representing a year-on-year rise of 23 per cent, and put the industry on course for total sales this year of about 45,000 units. This compares with 36,3507 last year and 31,398 in 1992. Both Iveco-Ford and Leyland DAF indicated that truck sales could reach 50,000 next year. At 19,824, total registrations of all types of commercial vehicle last month were 17.1 per cent higher than in the previous November.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "Short and Clear" rubric] </F>   [Text] In its May Day address to the workers of the  republic, the Labor Party of Azerbaijan called on all political  parties, trade unions, and youth organizations to consolidate  within the framework of the left-center bloc. The address  emphasizes that today "a society is being built where money and  only money is the law, arbitrariness substitutes for legality,  and lies--for morality... In doing this, the champions of the  bright capitalist future never bothered to ask ordinary people  whether they want this kind of life." The Labor Party's  Provisional Executive Committee believes that the "political and  social rights of the people can be defended only by combining  efforts."</p>

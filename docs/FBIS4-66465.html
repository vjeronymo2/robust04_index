			<p>CSO     [Text] A MITI-backed project to promote the free  international exchange of manufacturing technology may be  finally getting off the ground with plans to step up research  and funding.    The idea of making more effective and efficient use of  elementary manufacturing technology by sharing it as a global  asset was first put forward in 1989 by Professor Hiroyuki  Yoshikawa, president of the University of Tokyo.    When the Ministry of International Trade and Industry threw  its weight behind the idea, however, other countries were  skeptical. Industrial know-how has long been Japan's powerbase.  With the country's economy looking unstoppable at the time,  other countries suspected Japan would have the most to gain from  the pooling of manufacturing secrets into an international data  base.  <H5>  Changing Attitudes </H5>   Recently, however, the project, known as Intelligent  Manufacturing System (IMS) Plan, is winning more acceptance, its  supporters say. The ending of the Cold War has made the  international community more open to ideas such as  ``technoglobalism.''    Intensified competition in the business world is also  working  to promote the exchange of production know-how. Rival  corporations are increasingly forming transnational alliances,  sometimes manufacturing products under their competitor's brand  name.    In January, the International Steering Committee, a  private-sector body which governs the project, urged all  participating companies and research institutes from member  countries to step up their studies on ways to implement IMS. It  has set a 10-year goal to have the system up and running.    Participating in the project are private corporations and  institutes from Japan, the U.S., Europe, Canada and Australia.  MITI has earmarked more than &yen;1.25 billion ($11.9 million)  in 1994 budget for research fees connected with IMS.  <H5>  Time, Money Saver </H5>   Under the plan, it is envisioned that product designers  could  access a data base to find necessary elementary manufacturing  technologies. This would allow them to build effective  applications in a shorter amount of time.    The scheme would also give product designers access to  information obtained from point-of-sales surveys by other  manufacturers.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-020L-71A>      FIGURE </FIG>     The prime benefit of the plan is that it would save money  wasted by companies on reinventing technologies that already  exist. Furthermore, the establishment of IMS would make it  easier to implement environment maintenance systems such as  recycling as part of manufacturing technologies.    For the past two years, participants in the project have  carried out preliminary research on topics including  systematization of knowledge, environmentally friendly  processing industries and concurrent engineering for  international production.    Fully 142 facilities, comprised of 87 corporations and 55  universities from participating countries, have played a part in  the research. Japan took the lead in researching the  systemization of knowledge with 19 corporations, nine  universities and national research organizations taking part.    Because IMS would create international cooperative research  on an unprecedented scale, one of the main topics of the  preliminary research was how to deal with intellectual property  rights, including patents generated from IMS projects.    The studies so far have suggested creating three types of  regulations to protect the integrity of the system. Some  regulations would be compulsory throughout the entire system,  other regulations would be recommended for implementing in  cooperative agreements and still other regulations would be  permissible depending on the desires of the participants.    Preliminary agreements have determined that a partner could  share research results with a third party without gaining  permission from the other partner. Furthermore, a partner in  cooperative research will be able to use research results in  commercial applications without compensating the other partner.    However, a company can agree to pay fees to non-profit  research facilities when using results in commercial  applications. An agreement was also reached to draw a  distinction between academic use and commercial use of patents  held by individual researchers and only charge royalties on  commercial uses.</p>

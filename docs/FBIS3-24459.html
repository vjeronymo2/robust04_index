			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report from Gazprom Information-Advertising Center: </F> "Gazprom Knows the Sense in Missiles"]    [Text] A delegation from the Russian Joint Stock Company  [RAO] Gazprom headed by chairman of the board R. Vyakhirev  visited the Perm design and production joint stock companies  Aviyadvigatel and Permskiye Motory, the Iskra  scientific-production association and one of the city's  machinebuilding enterprises. Until recently these converted  enterprises worked on orders from the defense and aviation  industries, producing engines for military and civilian  designation as well as missile equipment.    Last year RAO Gazprom and the Perm enterprises concluded a  three-year agreement on the development and experimental  production, on the basis of aviation engines, of gas pumping  units with a 12MVt capacity and a coefficient of useful service  life of more than 34 percent.    Beginning in the 70s the gas industry used aviation engines  as drive pumps at gas compressor stations of the main gas  pipelines. However, at that time Gazprom used old equipment  which had already exhausted its flight resources and which had  low technical-economic indicators. During its visit to Perm the  Gazprom delegation reviewed the experimental gas pumping unit  models working at one of the gas pumping statons under Perm and  discussed the course of further work on developing and  implementing production of these units with the leadership of  the Perm enterprises and design bureaus.    Production of this equipment ordered by Gazprom at Perm  enterprises will allow for carrying out reconstruction at the  currently existing compressor stations. As a result, the  productivity of the mainline gas pipelines will increase 15-20  percent, waste of gas will drop and expenses for repair work  will decrease.    In addition, the orders from RAO Gazprom will allow the Perm  enterprises to maintain their scientific and technical  potential. Purchases of imported equipment will decrease as a  whole for each sector.</p>

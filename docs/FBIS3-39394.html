This is shown by the latest poll that Sifo  [Swedish Institute for Opinion Research] has carried out for  GOTEBORGSPOSTEN.    But opposition has only increased marginally, and the yes  side has held on to most of the marked advance it achieved in  the previous poll.    The latest poll was carried out from 7 to 10 February, at  the  same time as the Swedish negotiations in Brussels were running  into difficulties. Nevertheless, the new yes sayers did not  flock to the opposition side, the newspaper notes.    In January the percentage of those saying yes rose from 26  to  34 percent. In February the yes side had 32 percent, a decrease  that lies within the margin of statistical error.    The no side is still leading by a relatively comfortable  margin. It also increased a little, from 39 to 40 percent.    But many people have still not made up their minds. The  percentage of those who are undecided rose from 27 to 28 percent.    Young people are no longer markedly more negative to the EU  than the population as a whole, the poll shows. And young  people under 30 have made up their minds to a greater extent  than others -- only 23 percent of the 1,000 interviewed are  doubtful.    Divided up according to party sympathies, the latest poll  shows no statistically firm changes.    However, the number of those saying yes among nonsocialist  voters has decreased from 60 to 54 percent.    Among Social Democrats, the trend for the percentage of  those  who are undecided to increase at the expense of those saying no  continues.    Uncertain Social Democrats now number 32 percent, 47 percent  are against, and 21 percent for.</p>

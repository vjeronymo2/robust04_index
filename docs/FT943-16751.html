			<p>940702 FT  02 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: UK equities The FT-SE 100 index seems to have found a footing above 2,900 this week, but it would be rash to assume that its troubles are over. First there is the hurdle of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting next week. Then there is the industrial summit at the weekend. With the dollar looking weak again last night, the chances remain that US interest rates could be raised. Indeed, the currency could fall quite sharply if the summit passes without such action. Either way the markets look vulnerable to upset all over again. On a historic multiple of around 15, equities look reasonable value in theory and could attract some cash now that the new quarter has started. But the yield premium over index-linked gilts remains very tight at only around 10 basis points. Equities thus have very little room to outperform. Thanks in part to some generous payouts by electricity companies, dividends are growing at around 10 per cent. At a stretch the prospect of real dividend growth could offer some compensation for equities' narrow premium over index-linked gilts. The trouble is that high real dividend growth depends on rising earnings which in turn requires continued robust recovery. If that happens rising real interest rates in the gilt-edged market could still hold equities back.</p>

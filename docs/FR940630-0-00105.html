			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the definition of metropolitan area is too geographically broad and will impede the effectiveness of section 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``metropolitan area'' is the standard definition for this term used in all, or if not all, the majority of Federal regulations. The statute recognized that ``metropolitan area'' covers a broad geographical area, which is why the statute directs recipients to first give preferences to low- and very low-income residents and businesses within smaller geographical areas. For HAs, these smaller geographical areas are housing developments; and for other recipients, these smaller geographical areas are the service area or neighborhood in which the section 3 covered project is located.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four commenters objected to the inclusion of ``soft costs'' in the definition of ``project cost.'' Soft costs are costs associated with the financing and development of the project and relocation costs and land acquisition costs. The commenters stated that these costs which refer to costs such as accounting, architectural, and engineering are ``unrealistic.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The definition of ``project cost'' is no longer in the regulation. By ``unrealistic,'' the Department assumes that the commenters mean that recipients or contractors will be unable to identify section 3 residents or section 3 business concerns that have skills in the areas of accounting, architecture, engineering, and related professions (professional opportunities that may be covered by section 3 depending upon the project or activity for which section 3 covered assistance is expended). The recent closing of military bases, and factories, and major industry plants have left many skilled professionals unemployed. Therefore, it is not totally unrealistic that low- or very low-income persons may have skills in the professions identified above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Four commenters stated that the definition of ``service area'' covered too broad a geographical area, and should be limited.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rule defined ``service area'' to mean the geographical area in which the persons benefitting from the section 3 covered project reside, but which shall not extend beyond the unit of general local government in which the section 3 covered assistance is expended. The Department recognizes that this definition allows recipients to define the service area narrowly or broadly. The Department prefers to give recipients the flexibility to define the applicable service area, and declines at this stage to impose further limitations on recipients' assessment of the applicable service area. The Department anticipates that recipients will make a good faith effort to determine a realistic service area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 3 Clause  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters submitted comments on the section 3 clause. One commenter requested that the clause be eliminated. Another commenter requested that the clause be used as model or advisory language, but not made mandatory for all section 3 covered contracts. A few commenters stated that the clause should include the penalties to be imposed for violation of the part 135 regulations, or it should list the minimum efforts to be undertaken by contractors. Other commenters offered a number of editorial suggestions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department declines to eliminate the clause or to make it only advisory. The Department has made a number of editorial changes, but the clause is substantially the same as that set forth in the October 8, 1993 proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Apprenticeship Programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A few commenters expressed concern about language in the proposed rule that stated that participation in an approved apprenticeship program does not, in and of itself, demonstrate compliance with the regulations of part 135. The commenters stated that such language may discourage HAs from investing the time necessary to set up apprenticeship programs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department's intent was not to discourage participation by HAs in establishing apprenticeship programs, but to advise that participation in training programs in which the extent of an HA's participation is limited to referral of residents to the training program does not constitute compliance with section 3. The HA's participation must be more active, and provide for training and employment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Nine commenters stated that the rule does not address Davis-Bacon wage rate requirements or how to obtain exemptions from these requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The interim rule addresses the Davis-Bacon wage rate requirements, but not exemptions from these requirements. Section 3 does not provide a legal basis for exemption from Davis-Bacon requirements where they are otherwise applicable to section 3 covered projects.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employment Opportunities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Two commenters asked whether residents that are already in the employ of the HA may participate in decisions on the employment of, or award of contracts to, other residents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This decision is one that rests with the housing authority. The housing authority, however, should take measures to ensure that there is no conflict of interest in hiring decisions and in the award of contracts involving other residents. For example, a resident employed by the PHA and that has a financial interest in a resident-owned business should not be involved in the HA's decisions awarding contracts to resident-owned businesses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comment. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter asked how an HA, in employing a public housing resident, will deal with issues such as workers' compensation insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department expects an HA to address this issue as it would in employing anyone, whether the individual is a public housing resident or not. Most individuals do not seek employment with workers' compensation already in place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> July 2, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESTAURANT REVIEW: THEY KNOW THEIR DUCK AT ECCENTRIC LES PYRENEES  </P> <P> "What's French food?" asked the young woman intently.  </P> <P>  What's French food! How could I tell her?  </P> <P>  Twenty or even 15 years ago, French food might have been a battery of  techniques and a repertoire of classic dishes. But it was far more: a unique  window on food as an art form, almost a privileged state of being. Americans  went starry-eyed over French wine and passed around actual French cheese like a  sacrament. For restaurants, being French was something to aspire to.  </P> <P> Then we heard rumblings of what was being called nouvelle cuisine, and it  turned out a lot of hot young chefs in France were actually tired of the  classic dishes. They wanted to enrich the French tradition with Italian and  Japanese elements. Once we got over the shock of thinking French tradition  could be enriched, the idea made perfect sense -- we are, after all, a land of  immigrants. Furthermore, in California, we had a lot more cuisines at our  doorstep than just Italian and Japanese, so we started inventing dishes like  mad, though still mostly using French techniques.  </P> <P> And after a while, French restaurants as such seemed to fade from sight. I  couldn't even think of the last French restaurant I'd been in, and now I was at  Les Pyrenees, which is precisely what we thought of as a French restaurant in  Los Angeles not so long ago. It's a light, dainty room with lots of mirrors,  presided over by a maitre d' who tickles every table of diners in turn with  Gallic wit and charm. He'd be at our table any minute, and I had to explain  French food to the intent young woman and her friends pretty fast.  </P> <P> "Well," I began, "French food is what they eat in France. Let's see: snails,  frog's legs. . . ."  </P> <P> "Eeoo."  </P> <P> "How about if I just order for us?"  </P> <P> Onion soup was no problem; she knew onion soup, though she'd have preferred  more cheese on it. In fact, it was excellent, and I was glad it wasn't a  floating cheese pizza. The soup of the day was a simple, old-fashioned lentil  with wine, carrots, onions and bits of ham, also very good, neither too thick  nor too soupy.  </P> <P> The appetizers tend to be extremely old-fashioned, in fact. I'd already tried  the mushroom caps -- plain mushrooms, nothing Japanese -- stuffed with crab,  bread crumbs, garlic and parsley in lots of butter. The salmon mousseline was a  big hit with the intent young woman's neighbor, though I found the light  texture of the salmon fluffs a little floury, and the hay-sweet lobster sauce  the best part of the dish.  </P> <P> The liver pate she found ultra-familiar, and the escargots she tried with an  unconvincing air of martyrdom. There was no doubt, though, about the best of  the appetizers: a special that the charmingly Gallic maitre d' had pushed, of  particularly sweet and tender mussels in cream sauce.  </P> <P> The entrees are the very ones I used to see all the time on California French  menus. New York steak with a simple -- perhaps a little too simple -- red wine  sauce. Boneless double chicken breast with an excellent Madeira sauce, mostly  meat glaze without an overbearing presence of the wine. Tender chunks of  venison in wine sauce with green peppercorns (well, maybe not that  old-fashioned: a dish of the late '70s maybe). At lunch I'd had a thin-sliced  pork loin in a thin cream sauce full of whole-seed mustard.  </P> <P> Les Pyrenees does have two eccentricities: a habit of serving two silver  dollar-sized pancakes with every entree, and a monomania for duck. You can get  duck with the classic orange or cherry sauces (a bit on the sweet side, as  California French restaurants learned  </P> <P> Americans like it), and also with raspberry (also sweet, but not at all crazy),  honey (rather sweet and medieval-tasting), blueberry (too sweet) and green  peppercorn (not sweet at all). They know their duck here; the skin is  adequately crisp and the meat not dry.  </P> <P> Nobody was puzzled by the soft raspberry cheesecake, the mocha genoise cake  with coffee butter-cream filling and dark chocolate on top, or the brownie-like  flourless chocolate cake. The marzipan tart was a lot better than it sounds,  the marzipan less dry than you might fear and neatly counterpointed with bits  of apricot. The best of the desserts was a lemon meringue tart with an  elegantly thin filling and handsomely shaped curls of meringue on top.  </P> <P> Throughout the meal, my young guests studied everything as an exoticism, but at  the end they seemed to conclude that French food wasn't that exotic after all.  In effect, they'd had bits and pieces of this meal as California cuisine.  </P> <P> Ah, but not all in the same place, right? And without the Gallic wit and charm,  right? That's the difference; that's what French food is. These days, anyway.  </P> <P> Recommended dishes: onion soup, $5.50; duck with raspberry sauce, $16.75; lemon  meringue tart, $5.  </P> <P>  Les Pyrenees, 2455 Santa Monica Blvd., Santa Monica. (213) 828-7503. Open for  lunch 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday through Friday, dinner 5:30 to 10 p.m.  Tuesday through Sunday. Full bar. Street parking. American Express, MasterCard  and Visa accepted.

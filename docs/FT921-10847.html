			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Disputes break out as print group slims BPCC, Britain's biggest printing group, has suffered a rash of industrial disputes in response to the company's attempts to reduce over-capacity. Mr George Jerome, a national official of the Graphical, Paper and Media Union, said it was in dispute in nearly a dozen of BPCC's 44 plants over issues including equal pay, casualisation, training and redundancy selection. The most serious disputes are at Pulmans in Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, and Cromo in Nottingham, where BPCC has reverted to normal five-day-a-week, three-shift work, having been on a six-day, four-shift system. Both plants voted yesterday for industrial action in response to what Mr Jerome described as a 'unilateral breach of national agreements signed in 1990'. Pulmans has about 200 union members and Cromo about 300. Mr John Holloran, chief executive of BPCC, said that because of the recession and overcapacity in the industry, six-day working was no longer needed. The recession has squeezed margins but the company, which was bought from Mr Robert Maxwell for Pounds 235m in 1989, is still expected to make a profit this year.</p>

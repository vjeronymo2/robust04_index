			<p>910415 FT  15 APR 91 / Experts tackle oil threat POLLUTION experts were last night working to avert a possible ecological disaster in the Mediterranean after the sinking of an oil tanker off the Italian coast at the weekend. One slick is already threatening a 10-mile stretch of Italy's most popular holiday coastline and the government has declared a national state of emergency. The Haven, the 109,000-deadweight-ton tanker which sank yesterday in the Bay of Genoa after catching fire on Thursday, is a sister ship of the Amoco Cadiz. The Amoco caused one of the world's worst oil pollution incidents when it ran aground off France in 1978, spilling 1.6m barrels of oil on to the Brittany coast. A task force comprising the Italian Navy, merchant marine and environmental officials was examining the feasibility of containing what appeared earlier at the weekend to be an escalating catastrophe. However, Mr Tosh Miller, of the International Tanker Owners' Pollution Federation, was optimistic last night that damage could be limited. Flights over the spillages indicated yesterday morning that less than 5,000 tonnes of oil had escaped, he said. Greenpeace, the environmental group, had suggested that some 25,000 to 30,000 tonnes of oil might have leaked from the vessel. Ms Luisa Pierantonelli, a director of the Rome command centre set up by the Italian environment ministry to handle the crisis, estimated that 434,000 barrels of oil were still on board. She speculated that as much as 90 per cent could have burned off. Other environment ministry officials said the thick consistency of Iranian heavy crude would help limit the damage. Two large explosions, one on Saturday and one early yesterday, had rocked the listing Haven, which caught fire four days ago after an explosion in which two crewmen died and three remain missing. The Italian Navy towed the ship 11 miles into shallow water where it sank to a depth of 68 metres about a mile offshore, leading to hopes that some of its 1,035,000 barrels of Continued on Page 16 Iranian crude - nearly four times the oil that spilt from the Exxon Valdez off Alaska in March 1989 - could be pre-vented from discharging. The ship has 56 compartments, and it is not clear how many have been ruptured. Italian officials said oil was no longer leaking after the sinking. Troodos Shipping and Trading, the London agent acting for the Haven's Cypriot owners, said the Smit Rotterdam salvage tug had been chartered to assist in an effort to pump the remaining oil out of the submerged tanker. Most of the pollution control work is centred on a seven-mile long and two-mile wide slick which was yesterday about four miles off the Italian Riviera, between Savona and Varraze. Locals fear the consequences of a break in the weather which has been settled for the past three days. Some small oil deposits have been washed up on the beach at Varraze but most of the slick has been contained by booms, many of which were installed by specialists from the Oil Spill Service Centre in Southampton who flew out last week. The centre, run by the large oil companies, is also equipped for mechanical skimmers used to scoop floating oil from the surface. French local authorities in Cannes, Nice and St. Tropez were on a state of alert over the weekend, while ecologists warned that the current could carry traces of oil to the French shore from Wednesday. The 17-year-old Haven, formerly called the Amoco Milford Haven, is one of five sister ships, four of which are now understood to have sunk. It had just undergone a two-year refit at the Keppel shipyard in Singapore.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Paris, March 3 (AFP) -- Conservative Prime  Minister Edouard Balladur on Thursday [3 March] told trade  unionists he was determined to go ahead with plans to cut  France's minimum legal wage, provoking a walk-out by the  secretary general of the powerful communist-led CGT union, Louis  Viannet.    At a stormy meeting Balladur defended his plan against  strong  opposition from trade unions, students and left-wing parties and  in spite of an opinion poll in the daily Info-Matin that showed  55 percent of the French opposed the plan while 36 percent  supported it.    Balladur was speaking at a roundtable with trade unionists  and employers' representatives that had originally been  scheduled to debate employment prospects, but the meeting was  dominated by the plan to allow firms to recruit young workers  and pay them less than the take-home minimum of 880 dollars a  month.    Students and trade unions planned protest marches later on  Thursday to fight the plan.    Viannet said new proposals on the wage cut plan made by  Balladur on Thursday were "mere window-dressing." He said all  the trade unions had been unanimous in condemning the plan.    Viannet said Balladur had proposed introducing a distinction  between holders of university degrees and diplomas and  unqualified youths.    Labour Minister Michel Giraud was attending the meeting.

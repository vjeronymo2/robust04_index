			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (13): Fortress mentality is a fiction - Regional blocks / Economists are right to be concerned, but they are worrying about the wrong threat ONE OF the mightier fictions of the 1990s has been that the world is dividing into trade blocks. Proponents point to the North American Free Trade Agreement, which looks likely to come into being at the end of 1994, and the supposed emergence of a 'yen block' focused on the Japanese economy, to underpin their claim. They point to the parlous state of Uruguay round negotiations aimed at multilateral liberalisation of world trade, and argue that if the talks fail, or reach 'second-best' solutions to problems in international trade, then leaders will seek regional deals instead. The warning is that trade barriers would then be raised between 'Fortress Europe', 'Fortress North America' and 'Fortress Asia', forcing companies to retreat behind the fortress walls. The risk of trade conflict between regions would then be high, with many of the gains of trade liberalisation over the past 40 years in jeopardy. But the facts do not support so neat and dramatic a trend. Asking specifically whether trade blocks were emerging in Europe, North America, and East Asia, Mr Jeff Schott, at Washington's Institute for International Economics, comments: 'The short answer is: yes, maybe, and no. 'A European trade block is clearly in existence, and developing further; a North American block is evolving, although with a distinct outward orientation; and an East Asian block remains a remote prospect.' The world's only true trade bloc at present is the European Community. Internal trade for member states accounts on average for two thirds of total trade. Countries such as Ireland and Portugal rely on the EC market for almost three quarters of total trade. The EC's tentacles reach into the Efta countries on its borders, and have begun to move into east and central Europe. Mr Schott identifies four basic characteristics for a trade block: similar levels of per capita gross national product, geographic proximity, similar or compatible trading regimes, and political commitment to regional organisation. The EC alone appears to match all four of these. The EC also illustrates the best and the worst aspects of trade blocks, which are allowed under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on condition that they result in removal of barriers to substantially all trade within the block, and as long as they do not result in barriers being raised to third countries. As the creation of the single European market in January this year illustrates, the EC has moved far in removal of barriers to trade among member states. But its trade with third countries is riddled with the worst kinds of discrimination. As Martin Wolf, a former leading trade economist and now a colleague on the Financial Times, wrote in a recent paper: 'Only in discrimination can the EC claim to be a world leader. It is not only itself a huge trading block: it spreads discrimination worldwide. It finds trade tolerable, except where its producers find imports uncomfortably cheap.' He notes how in 1991, 40 per cent of all EC imports entered the market under preferential arrangements: 22.4 per cent under agreements with Efta countries; 7.1 per cent on preferences given to Mediterranean countries; 3.9 per cent under the Lome convention with developing countries mainly the Pacific and the Caribbean, and 6.2 per cent under general system of preferences (GSP) agreements. In net terms, this means that four fifths of cross-border commerce for EC member states is either subject to single market rules, or to preferential import arrangements. At the very least, therefore, the EC's growth has had a trade diverting effect: many companies that might otherwise have exported to Europe have invested locally, and have chosen to supply the EC market from within. There is also evidence that consumers in the EC, and companies sourcing components from within the EC, have paid a high price for the creation of 'Fortress Europe', and the discrimination embodied in Brussels' policies. Peter Sutherland, the new director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), pointed out in a recent study that transfers to EC farmers under the common agriculture policy cost consumers about Dollars 156bn - or Dollars 450 a year for every man, woman and child in the community. 'It is high time that governments made clear to consumers just how much they pay - in the shops and as tax payers - for decisions to protect domestic industries from import competition,' Mr Sutherland commented. These high costs have damaged the export competitiveness of European manufacturers, forcing on them a vicious circle in which they have no option but to seek protection in their domestic markets against imports from less-encumbered manufacturers in Asia and the US. It was such a vicious circle that eventually brought the trade block of all trade blocks - Comecon - to its knees. The US has nevertheless begun to flirt seriously with the idea, partly out of pique over the glacial progress of the Uruguay round negotiations. First, its free trade agreement with Canada in 1989, and now its plans to create a North American Free Trade Agreement embracing Mexico, provide the fruits of that flirtation. In certain respects, Nafta is no more than a description of economic reality: the US provides the end market for three quarters of all exports from Canada and Mexico. It is not ambitious as the EC has been in trying to create a single integrated market. But at the same time, it seems unlikely to discriminate so powerfully against outside markets: the US relies on outside markets for almost 75 per cent of its exports. It is also home to the majority of the world's globally integrated companies, none of which would welcome fresh barriers to its intra-company trade. All three countries maintain large trade deficits with the rest of the world, and thus need to improve exports to outside markets if they are to reduce the imbalance. This could not be done by withdrawing inside a Fortress North America. Mexico has sought membership of Nafta as a means of cementing a wide range of policies aimed at economic liberalisation, and has no desire to see the Nafta rules reverse these. Neither Canada nor Mexico have any desire to have their economies any further dominated by the US. They continue to call for a strong and rule-based multinational trading system - in short a strong Gatt, and a successful Uruguay round outcome - if they are to achieve any sort of equilibrium in their relations with the US. As Mr Schott notes in a recent book on the Nafta: 'The trade effects of the Nafta on third countries depend on the extent of liberalisation achieved in the Nafta itself, and on trade reforms negotiated in the Uruguay round . . . Trade diversion is likely to be greatest if the Nafta reforms proceed in the absence of a successful Gatt round.' If Uruguay round negotiations do indeed flounder in this critical final quarter of 1993, then the US is likely to explore carefully the prospects for cementing closer economic relations across the Pacific region. A ministerial meeting in Seattle in October of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation grouping is likely to assume great importance. In the recent past the Apec group has come to be seen by some economists as an Asian trade block in embryo. They see strong flows of Japanese investment across Asia, and rising levels of intra-regional trade, as evidence supporting their view. It is nevertheless mistaken. Japanese investment across parts of east Asia has indeed been strong, at least up to the recent bursting of the 'bubble economy'. But Japanese investment flows to the US, and to Europe have been equally strong. According to Mr Gorota Kume, secretary-general of the Japan Institute for Overseas Investment, Japanese foreign investment rose sixfold between 1985 and 1989, peaking at Dollars 67.5bn in 1989. But less than 15 per cent of this went to Asia. Looking at individual east Asian countries, Malaysia attracted 25 per cent of its inward investment from Japan between 1988 and 1990, according to the UN's World Investment Report. But other countries in the east Asia region accounted for 42 per cent, while investment from North America or Europe accounted for 33 per cent. In Thailand and Korea, Japan accounted for 45 per cent and 49 per cent of investment respectively, but in Singapore it accounted for just 35 per cent, in Indonesia 18 per cent, and in China a mere 12 per cent. Intra-regional trade has grown strongly - from 19 per cent of total trade in 1970, to almost 30 per cent today. But this growth says more about increasing wealth in the region, and its growing importance as an end market for consumer goods than it does about any tendency towards a trade block. Preconditions for a trade block barely exist: markets are geographically far apart; they range from poor, to extremely prosperous; they maintain divergent trade regimes; and they have shown no powerful political commitment to economic integration. They have direct experience of the gains to be reaped from maintaining liberal trading regimes. As Mr Wolf notes: 'As the world's most successful economies, those of east Asia are unlikely to follow the path of discrimination soon.' If in the wake of a collapse in Uruguay round negotiations the US recoils, and turns to the Asia-Pacific region, the consequence is unlikely to be a fragmentation of the world into three blocks. Rather, it could result in two  -the greater European region, focused on the EC and looking inward; and the rest of the world, increasingly interdependent and looking outward. The threat is thus not of the emergence of trade blocks, but of European withdrawal from international trade, and the consequent erosion of the Gatt's multilateral trade rules. Economists are right to be concerned, but they are worrying about the wrong threat.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          EMERGING TRADING BLOCKS?  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1980            1986            1989                           Dollars     %    Dollars    %   Dollars      %                             bn                bn             bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC-12 Total imports              826.5    100     781.4   100   1,165.8    100  of which:     Intra-regional trade   399.5     48    44.5.4    57     677.2     57     Imports from ROW*      427.0     52     336.0    43     498.6     43     from East Asia          49.0      6      63.9     8     104.5      9     from North America      85.8     10      66.0     8     104.2      9 NORTH AMERICA** Total imports              335.7    100     481.9   100     635.9    100  of which:     Intra-regional trade   107.5     32     150.5    31     210.4     33     Imports from ROW       228.2     68     331.4    69     425.5     67     from East Asia          64.2     19     159.4    33     202.0     32     from EC-12              50.1     15      90.6    19     105.8     17 EAST ASIA Total imports              294.5    100     308.7   100     558.2    100  of which:     Intra-regional trade    92.8     32     117.9    38     224.5     40     Imports from ROW       201.7     68     190.8    62     333.7     60     from North America      59.6     20      69.9    23     123.8     22     from EC-12              29.2     10      40.4    13      77.0     14  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Rest of the world. ** US, Canada and Mexico  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: IMF, Direction of Trade Statistics Yearbook  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

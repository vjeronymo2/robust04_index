			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Bundesbank chief prescribes more belt-tightening Painful changes in German pay and public spending policies must continue for some years if economic growth is to be sustained, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank president, said yesterday. 'Cyclical recovery alone is not sufficient. The necessary corrections must be achieved in the medium term no matter how much they hurt,' he said in a speech in Hamburg. Speaking as wage negotiations started in Stuttgart on behalf of 3.5m public sector employees, he stressed it was not the task of monetary policy to 'correct the mistakes and failings of others'. Pay negotiators and politicians had made a start, but they would have to do more, he said. The oTV public sector union yesterday formally tabled a claim for a 4 per cent award, offering to accept less in return for limits on job losses. The employers, represented by federal and regional ministers, have for months warned that they want a 'zero' settlement in the light of the spending restraint demanded by the Bundesbank. Indications from other settlements suggested that the result would depend on the negotiators' definition of 'zero'. Any award of less than 3 per cent - the expected inflation rate this year - would result in a real loss of earnings. A recent deal in the chemicals industry, worth a nominal 1.5 per cent, was mirrored earlier this week in a similar settlement for paper workers. Analysts said anything more for public servants, many of whom are guaranteed jobs for life by their civil servant status, was unlikely. While industrial union claims so far have focused as usual on percentage increases, employers have concentrated on trying to change working practices. The chemical union's acceptance of working times adjustable according to demand, and of below-basic pay for new hirings, has raised hopes of similar flexibility in other sectors. At banking sector talks, which entered the second round yesterday, employers demanded more flexible working times and freedom for individuals to elect to work part-time. Engineering employers want to adapt the incoming standard 35-hour week to allow employees to work between 30 and 40 hours according to market conditions. Although the powerful IG Metall engineering union this week threatened national warning strikes if employers continued to avoid discussing its claim for up to 6 per cent, industrial leaders were unmoved. They appeared determined to exploit fears of unemployment caused by the lingering recession to press through change, despite signs that the low point has been passed. As Mr Tietmeyer noted yesterday, export demand in October and November last year was 7.5 per cent higher than a year earlier.</p>

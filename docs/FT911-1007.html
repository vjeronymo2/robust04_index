			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Parliament and Politics: Row over 'shopkeeper' statement - Monmouth MR Roger Evans, the Tory candidate in the Monmouth by-election, yesterday fuelled the continuing row over two local hospitals possibly opting out to become self-governing trusts, when he compared not balloting patients about whether hospitals should opt out with a shopkeeper not balloting his customers to find out what they wanted to buy, Alison Smith writes. Asked whether he was saying the NHS was like Tesco supermarkets, he said he was simply suggesting that the organisation was used by a changing class of person 'which are patients, in exactly the same way that Tesco has a different group of people using it each day.' Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, representing Mr Huw Edwards, the Labour candidate, at a candidates' meeting in Chepstow, said government plans were turning the NHS into a 'health supermarket'. But the other parties criticised Mr Edwards' failure to attend the meeting. Letters, Page 19</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Belgrade, March 9 (XINHUA) -- Bosnian Muslim leader  Alija Izetbegovic said today that the Washington agreement  reached between Croats and Bosnian Muslims is not aimed at any  third party, including Serbs.    The agreement is the result of the interests of the Muslim  and Croatian nationalities, Izetbegovic said over Croatian  television.    This was the first explicit comment made by the Muslim  leader  on the preliminary accord signed in Washington on March 1, under  which Bosnian Muslims and Croats will found a federation to be  turned later into a confederation with Croatia.    But Izetbegovic stressed the integrity of Bosnia and ruled  out the possibility of allowing Bosnian Serbs to take away part  of the land to Serbia.    The federation accord obviously means the recapture of lost  territory, he said.    The Muslim leader described the agreement as a major step  toward peace and said that what is at issue now is how Serbs  will act accordingly.    He reiterated his expectation that peace may come in late  autumn.</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Lloyd Thompson hemmed in to Pounds 18.2m Difficult trading conditions in the London insurance market hemmed in profit growth at Lloyd Thompson Group last year, pre-tax profits rising 5 per cent to Pounds 18.2m for the 12 months ended 30 June, 1994. The result was in line with market expectations following a profits warning in June and the shares slipped 1p to 169p. The company also announced it is to purchase the remaining 80 per cent it does not own in MIU, an associated company, for about Pounds 12.8m, which will be satisfied by the issue of some 7.6m shares or 9.75 per cent of the issued share capital. Lloyd Thompson has had 80 per cent management control of MIU, which handles the insurance group's non-marine and non-US business, since 1989. Group turnover edged up 3 per cent to Pounds 42.41m (Pounds 41.14m) in the year, while investment income declined 29 per cent to Pounds 4.23m (Pounds 5.96m). Earnings per share fell from 14.8p to 14.36p, but the dividend was increased by 16 per cent to 7.8p (6.7p), with a 5.4p final. Mr Ken Carter, chief executive, said that while trading conditions remained tough, the group had achieved operating profits growth of 22 per cent to Pounds 14m (Pounds 11.5m). He added that the company would be attempting to widen its geographic spread, looking to win more business in Latin America, Australia and South Africa. 'We have reduced expenditure as much as we can and have got to expand through our brokerage business,' he said. Turnover from the marine insurance business increased 5 per cent to Pounds 18.27m (Pounds 17.35m), while the marine side grew 7 per cent to Pounds 12.56m (Pounds 11.75m). However, reinsurance turnover slipped 4 per cent to Pounds 11.57m (Pounds 12.04m).</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY BORN TO SHOOTING VICTIM RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL  </P> <P> Keniesha Pope Harden, born earlier this month just minutes before her mother  died from gunshot wounds suffered in a drive-by shooting, has been released  from a local hospital.  </P> <P> "Everything's just fine," said Deirdre Pope, the baby's aunt.  </P> <P> "We will all help" rear the infant, she said.  </P> <P> Keniesha's mother, Kentzie Pope, died on the operating table at St. Mary  Medical Center early Aug. 2, just 20 minutes after giving birth to her.  </P> <P> Pope, 30, was the victim of a drive-by shooting that occurred late Aug. 1 in  front of her apartment building on Elm Avenue. Police said they think that she  was accidentally shot by gang members aiming at someone else.  </P> <P> Pope -- who was eight months' pregnant -- was kept alive by what a hospital  administrator called "aggressive resuscitation" while an emergency Cesarean was  performed.  </P> <P> The baby, in critical condition because of the premature birth, was taken to  the hospital's neonatal intensive-care unit. She remained there until Wednesday  afternoon, when she was released in good condition to her aunt.  </P> <P> Carolyn Cohen, a hospital spokeswoman, said Keniesha weighed 4 pounds, 6 ounces  upon release.  </P> <P> "We're just happy that we could get some good out of what was essentially a  tragic situation," Cohen said. "We wish we could have saved both lives."  </P> <P> Family members said the infant will live in the Elm Avenue apartment with her  aunt, grandmother, two sisters, ages 5 and 10, and an 11-year-old cousin.  </P> <P> "If it hadn't been for our faith, we wouldn't be as strong as we are," Deirdre  Pope said. "I've had lots of nieces and nephews, so this is nothing new. We're  doing OK."  </P> <P> No arrests have been made in the shooting.  </P></p>

			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: NHL losses cut to Pounds 37m after lower provisions National Home Loans Holdings, the mortgage lender, announced a sharp fall in pre-tax losses from Pounds 159.4m to Pounds 36.6m in the year to September 30, after a marked drop in provisions against bad and doubtful debts. Provisions were halved at Pounds 82.1m (Pounds 163.9m) because of stabilising house prices, falling arrears, and improvements in the amount of cash received as a percentage of monthly payments due. Mr Jonathan Perry, chairman, said that the number of accounts more than three months in arrears had fallen to 1,762 from the group's total of 45,000 accounts, compared with 6,130 at the end of September 1992. He added that the company was now trading profitably. The company said the improvement was shown by the cash received from borrowers in arrears increasing from 81 per cent of normal monthly payments in September 1992 to 98 per cent in September this year. Total operating income for the period was Pounds 83.4m (Pounds 51.8m). Losses per share were 43.1p (156.4p). Mr Perry said that the next stage of the group's strategy was to rebuild its capital base. The group managed Pounds 2bn of mortgage assets at the end of September, down by 23 per cent over the past year. NHL's mortgage lending business was badly hit in the fall-out from the late 1980s housing boom. Rapid growth at that time meant that its portfolio was not strong enough to survive the subsequent collapse. It intends to start lending new mortgages from mid-1994, offering products to new borrowers. Existing borrowers, who have been paying rates above the market average, yesterday benefited from the passing on of the 0.5 per cent pre-Budget cut in interest rates. Mr Perry said that there were preference dividend arrears of Pounds 16m, and negative distributable reserves of Pounds 153m. During the year the group brought on to its balance sheet the special purpose vehicle companies which make up most of its mortgage securitisations. It said that the effect on the 1993 trading performance was neutral.</p>

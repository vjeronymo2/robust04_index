			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 6 May (TANJUG) -- The Muslim Government  has cancelled the meeting between the commander of the 2d  (Tuzla) Corps of the Muslim forces and the commander of the  eastern Bosnian corps of the republic of Srpska army, scheduled  for tomorrow -- the information service of the main headquarters  of the republic of Srpska army announced this evening.  According to a statement by the information service, Colonel  Engelen, the chief of staff of the UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces] command for the northeast, who mediated in the  organization of the meeting, today sent the following letter to  Major General Novica Simic, the commander of the eastern Bosnian  corps of the republic of Srpska army:    ``1. Although General Hazim Sadic, commander of the 2d Corps  of the Bosnian Army, wants to meet you as soon as possible, his  government has ordered him to cancel his earlier acceptance of  the meeting. This will be dealt with at the highest level.    "2. This is why we suggest that the meeting scheduled for  1300 on 7 May be postponed until further notice."    The information service statement, also forwarded to TANJUG,  says that "this latest refusal to negotiate on the part of the  extremist Muslim leaders in Sarajevo clearly shows that they are  in favor of the war option, that they want to procrastinate with  the negotiations as long as possible, and that they will not  give up on the planned and prepared offensive against the town  of Brcko and Serbian Posavina."    As Gen. Simic told TANJUG today, the talks were to focus on  a  cease-fire on the Brcko battlefield, exchange of prisoners, the  unhindered passage of civilians, and the establishment of the  so-called hot line.</p>

			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Poor outlook for E Germany THE business outlook for east German enterprises has continued to deteriorate in 1992, and production is expected to be stagnant in the second half of the year, according to a new survey of the former Communist economy. The Institute for Economic Research in Halle reported yesterday that a questionnaire of 300 companies showed that their positive expectations in the first part of the year had not been fulfilled. It cited in particular newly-privatised enterprises reporting a sharp fall in business prospects, and a general deterioration in external conditions - reflecting in particular the collapse in trade with eastern Europe. The only sectors showing an upturn were construction and service industries, according to the institute. With the turnover of manufacturing industry expected to be stagnant in the second half of the year, overall turnover for 1992 would be significantly lower than in 1991. The gloomy report coincided with a new flurry of debate in Bonn about how to finance the cost of public transfers to the east German economy. There were heated denials from the Chancellor's Office, and from members of the ruling government coalition, of a report in the mass-circulation Bild Zeitung that a compulsory loan scheme was once again under debate. The newspaper said the plan involved a 7.5 per cent surcharge on income tax, payable for 10 years, which would be repaid without any interest rate. The plan was flatly rejected by Mr Otto Lambsdorff, leader of the Free Democrats in the ruling coalition. What was required was rigorous savings from the government budget, and only if that failed to reduce the budget deficit should tax increases be contemplated, he said. The issue of raising more money to reduce the deficit and finance spending in the east is a key question on the agenda of talks for a 'solidarity pact' between German industry, trade unions, the government and opposition. Trade union leaders have made it clear they will not agree to any restraint on wages unless it is matched by sacrifices by the business sector and high-income groups. Editorial comment, Page 24</p>

			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Arts: Private means for public view - Contemporary Art Society Last winter the Contemporary Art Society celebrated its 80th anniversary by filling the Hayward Gallery with a survey of its activities and achievements over the years. The show concentrated, naturally enough, on the many plums the Society had produced for the public cake. To those unfamiliar with the Society's work, the scope of its engagement would have been surprise enough, but the true revelation was the sheer quality of what it had bought. Founded long before public funds were ever granted to public museums and galleries to buy directly for their collections, the intervention of such bodies as the CAS and the National Art Collections Fund was of critical and determining importance. Regular visitors to any of the modern collections held in our public galleries, not just in London but throughout Britain, Australia and Canada, are never surprised to read below established favourite and stimulating new acquisition alike: 'presented by the Contemporary Art Society'. That retrospective exercise of last winter is now complemented by this practical demonstration of the Society's current business, its true raison d'etre. Leaving aside its latter-day diversifications - the corporate buying, the tours and visits, the autumn market - its animating principle has always been to entrust the funds it has raised by private subscription to the hands of its chosen buyers, drawn in turn from the ranks of its executive committee. To them it gives an absolute discretion to buy what they like or consider appropriate, within the budget. Some choose to set themselves a policy, to plug a particular gap or to buy only work of a certain kind or within a set price. Some might look only to young artists, or artists hitherto unpatronised or long neglected. Some again might simply buy ad hoc, responding directly to what the chances of the art world put their way. In recent years the Society has made it its policy to include Fine Craft within its scope. One buyer a year is given this particular responsibility, and at Camden the room of craft purchases is both reproach and encouragement to those institutions yet to take the point. Given the comparative prices, the only wonder is that the demand has not long ago outstripped supply. When its store-rooms are full, the Society arranges a distribution to its subscribing galleries and museums. Anxious curators swarm in to make their lists and put in their bids. The great virtue of the system lies in its arbitrariness and unpredictability, at once its responsiveness and immunity to current fad and critical orthodoxy. The range of work is extraordinary in its catholicity, fair and generous and always unexpected, and it puts curators on the spot in a most salutary way. For here, on the one hand, are works by the rising stars, such luminaries of the Turner Prize and pets of the Patrons of New Art as Fiona Rae and Ian Davenport, that otherwise would be quite beyond the reach of a straitened but serious provincial collection. And on the other are works far below the priorities and current preoccupations of so august an institution as the Tate, shall we say, yet still something it would quietly wish to have - a Dennis Creffield Madonna, an Anthony Eyton figure, a Harry Holland shadow or a John Hubbard garden. What is pointed up above all else by this, as by every CAS distribution, argued tacitly yet so vehemently in the demonstration, is that serious, significant contemporary art is no narrow orthodoxy, the creature only of the most refined and critically acute hierophants of the avant-garde. That is not to argue that what comes out of Goldsmiths' at the moment, for example, or goes into the Lisson Gallery, is necessarily innocent of talent, but only that the sun rises on other places besides New Cross and Bell Street. For, fair or not, one does still sense in the official policies not only of the Tate but also of the British and the Arts Councils, that by now it is only the age and reputation of a Freud or an Auerbach, or for that matter a Albert Irvin or a John Bellany, that secures any interest in them, rather than what they still produce: they are, or were, good artists, but the world has moved on. That heresy must be nailed, and the simple truth proclaimed, that a painting of a cornfield may have at least as much to say of current reality and the human condition as any shark in a tank of formaldehyde. It is the Society's great strength that it has never forgotten this truth, nor that fashion is a fickle beast. Alongside the flavour of the moment, the Davenport, the Lisa Milroy, the Le Brun, Jackowski or Kapoor, it still finds room for the neglected or the temporarily unfashionable. These last are represented here by such distinguished examples as the oddly hedonistic minimalism of Peter Joseph, the symbolic expressionism of Martin Naylor, still-lifes by Len McComb or Stephen McKenna, a constructivist relief by Keith Milow. The list is endless, the show unfortunately little longer than a concert. See it.

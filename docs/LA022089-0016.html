			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> S. KOREA FOCUSES ON DISSIDENT'S TALE OF TORTURE;  </P> <P> PROSECUTION OF KIM KEUN TAE'S CASE MAY SIGNAL SEOUL'S HUMAN RIGHTS COURSE  </P> <P> Conversations with Kim Keun Tae lead invariably to the subject of torture.  </P> <P> Kim, one of South Korea's most prominent dissidents, endured three weeks of  beating, electric shock and water torture at the hands of the anti-Communist  bureau of the national police in 1985, according to international human rights  advocates and Kim's own account.  </P> <P> Now there is a chance that his tormentors will be brought to justice -- if the  government abides by a court order requiring a thorough investigation of the  allegations. Authorities say they have interrogated four police suspects and  begun a nationwide hunt for a fugitive police captain accused of directing  Kim's chamber of horrors.  </P> <P> The case has taken on symbolic importance ever since the country began its  tumultuous journey toward democracy two years ago. In some ways, one man's  defiance tells the story of an entire generation of political dissidents in  South Korea. And how the case is resolved in the courts may provide a signpost  for the course of human rights here.  </P> <P> The situation in South Korea is improving, the U.S. State Department said in a  report on human rights around the world, issued earlier this month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Few Major Cases  </P> <P> Although the number of political prisoners remained high, "no major cases of  torture or politically related killing came to light" in 1988, the report said.  (Human rights advocates estimate that 270 "prisoners of conscience" remain in  detention.)  </P> <P> But in the recent past, allegations of police brutality and torture-induced  confessions were frequent. The torture death of a student activist in January,  1987, sparked massive anti-government protests. Kim warns of the lingering  potential for renewed abuse, especially if the feared National Security Law,  under which he was arrested for anti-state activities, remains on the books.  </P> <P> President Roh Tae Woo's ruling Democratic Justice Party has said it is  considering modifying the law and changing its name. In its current form, the  law prohibits such acts as making statements that might be interpreted in such  a way as to advance the cause of Communist North Korea -- one of the charges of  which Kim was convicted.  </P> <P> "They can resume torture whenever they want," Kim said. "They want to keep the  law for emergencies."  </P> <P> Kim, 42, who, with his wife, activist In Jae Keun, shared the Robert F. Kennedy  Memorial human rights award for 1987, was released from prison under a  political amnesty last June. He has since returned to the work that made him a  government target.  </P> <P> Kim began quietly organizing, helping to unite bickering dissident groups into  a broad coalition dedicated to "mass struggle" -- dissident parlance for the  kind of spontaneous street protests that hastened democratic reform and  eventually drove former President Chun Doo Hwan into humiliating rural exile.  </P> <P> Kim is a wild card on the South Korean political scene, which settled down only  recently after two years of dramatic upheaval.  </P> <P> "He played a pivotal role in bringing dissidents together," said Lee Hae Chan,  an opposition lawmaker. "He has always set an example . . . a rational figure  whose affection for his fellows has been deepened by his hardships."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Recognize His Face  </P> <P> Almost all South Koreans have heard of Kim Keun Tae and have learned to  recognize his distinctively melancholy, oval-shaped face. But no one claims to  know exactly who he is, what he stands for or how much power he may one day  wield.  </P> <P> "I think of him as a fighter for social justice," said Lim Kyung Moon, 26, a  former riot police officer who recently returned to his studies in electrical  engineering at Korea University. "He's one of our martyrs, but I don't know  much about him."  </P> <P> A similar opaqueness of purpose shrouds the dissident movement as a whole,  which increasingly is adopting a tone of righteous anti-American scorn. Radical  students and many older activists accuse the United States of propping up Chun  and Roh in defiance of popular will.  </P> <P> Kim, one of three leaders who last month formed the dissident coalition  Chonminyon, or National People's Democratic Movement League, is evasive about  his vision for political and social change in South Korea.  </P> <P> Yet he insists that mainstream politicians -- even the opposition parties --  cannot be trusted with the task of steering the nation toward democracy.  </P> <P> "We want to set the course right," Kim said in a series of recent interviews.  "The government only responds with democratic concessions when they face mass  struggle."  </P> <P> The situation is not expected to explode any time soon, though it could heat up  later in the year, when students return to campuses and the National Assembly  goes back into session. Kim's coalition is likely to face its first test of  effectiveness during the spring labor offensive, analysts say.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, calls are mounting for dissidents like Kim to drop their  anti-establishment line and try working within the system. The polarization of  society is destabilizing, some observers say.  </P> <P> "They should seek ways to cooperate with democratic forces within the political  establishment," said Lee Shin Bum, himself a former dissident who has joined  the opposition Reunification Democratic Party. "It's wrong to dismiss  established forces as strictly conservative."  </P> <P> The government paints Kim as a seditious troublemaker, although it toned down  its denunciations after an international campaign, spurred by the Kennedy  award, sought his release from prison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Defection Report  </P> <P> One ranking government official, who declined to be identified by name,  described Kim as a hard-core Communist who advocates "proletarian revolution."  He cited a police report that was circulated at the time of Kim's arrest in  1985 that alleged that his three older brothers defected to the Communist north  during the 1950-53 Korean War.  </P> <P> Although Kim would have been about 5 years old at the time, this family  background somehow influenced his political outlook, the official said.  </P> <P> Kim tells a different story. Two of his brothers were killed and a third was  reported missing and presumed dead in the Korean War. He remembers his brothers  as "patriots," sympathetic with the resistance movement against Japanese  colonizers during World War II and opposed to the division of the peninsula.  </P> <P> But he denies being a Communist or a supporter of North Korea. He dismisses the  concept of a socialist class struggle as "befitting the teen-age, utopian  dreams" of university students.  </P> <P> "We activists in our middle age must be more responsible and work out a more  practical answer," Kim said. "But to the government, anyone who advocates true  democracy is a Communist. That's one of their tools of repression."  </P> <P> Kim comes from a middle-class background. His father was vice principal of an  elementary school in Suwon, a provincial capital south of Seoul. Kim turned to  radical politics while majoring in economics at Seoul National University,  South Korea's most prestigious educational institution, in the late 1960s.  </P> <P> After graduation, Kim chose to forgo the rewards of his elite education; he  went underground as a labor organizer.  </P> <P> His quiet, methodical approach to building alliances in the youth and labor  movements apparently threatened the government, which at the time adopted a  policy of crushing labor activism. But it also earned him the grudging respect  of some conservative analysts.  </P> <P> "It was not for the good, in my opinion, but his performance was brilliant when  he was a student leader," said Rhee Sang Woo, a security specialist and dean of  Sogang University's graduate school of public policy. "He is quite a man of  integrity, and he demonstrated great skills in organizing people."  </P> <P> Indeed, an aura of Confucian dignity emanates from the radical leader, who was  chairman of the National Youth Alliance for Democracy at the time of his  arrest.  </P> <P> Kim ceremoniously offered a bowl of persimmon punch to a visitor on a recent  winter afternoon, saying political talk should come only after sharing this  traditional drink of the lunar New Year.  </P> <P> Sitting cross-legged on the floor of his modest flat in northeastern Seoul, Kim  said he observed his first New Year's holiday out of prison in four years in  the old Korean way. He had his two children, ages 7 and 10, kowtow respectfully  before him, as is the custom; he in turn bowed toward the graves of his  parents.  </P> <P> Kim's articulate account of his torture experience has given him a cachet of  moral authority among activists. He has related his incredulity over how his  torturers discussed, with compassion, their family affairs at the same time  they attached electrical wires between his toes. Yet he is not happy with his  martyr image.  </P> <P> "Torture is something you can never build a resistance to," he said. "But I  don't want to be made into a sentimental figure, or to be remembered only as a  torture victim. I haven't overcome the experience, but I wasn't destroyed by  it."  </P></p>

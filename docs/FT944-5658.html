			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Leading Article: Insuring the uninsurable The safety net which insurance hangs under the risks of running a business is looking pretty ragged across much of the world. As insurance and reinsurance for next year are negotiated, many businesses are finding that the cost of securing cover is rising steeply. The upwards pressure on rates has been restrained by competition; reinsurance markets are currently flush with funds, partly because there have been relatively few natural disasters in the past two years. Nonetheless, some categories of risk are beginning to seem uninsurable, even where cover is a legal requirement. In others, only partial cover is obtainable. The areas proving most troublesome to price are those where the costs are potentially huge, even if the probability of the event is low. Such cases crop up most frequently under legislation for environmental protection, and health and safety. Yesterday UK government officials and insurers met to discuss the industry's plans to limit the coverage they will offer companies against the risk of death or injury to employees, even though this could put companies in breach of employment laws. These issues are not new. But they have grown more pressing, partly because of the size and unpredictability of damages awarded by the courts against companies. The problem is particularly acute in the US, where punitive damages are frequently awarded, and where the size of those damages can be determined by juries. In September a federal jury awarded Dollars 5bn in punitive damages against Exxon, the US oil group, for the sinking of its tanker off Alaska in 1989, even though Exxon had already spent Dollars 3bn cleaning up the coast. Contaminated land The spectacle of such awards has itself inflamed the trend towards litigiousness, in the US and beyond. Meanwhile, proposals for new regulation  -such as the UK's plans for allocating responsibility for contaminated land, which could greatly increase companies' liabilities - have further stirred the anxiety of insurers. The industry may well be guilty of exaggerating its grounds for concern. In particular, international reinsurers have tended to project their fears about US risk on to business in other countries, while some insurers have used the unproven theory of global warming to justify higher rates for storm cover. Whether or not the insurers are guilty of exaggeration, these trends mean that an increasing amount of business activity could end up uninsured. One consequence is that companies which have huge damages awarded against them will more frequently go bankrupt. Another is that some businesses may be abandoned altogether. Uncertain solution What can be done to stitch up the holes in the insurance net? The likely liabilities may become more predictable and insurance easier to price, as courts establish a longer record of precedents. But that is a lengthy and uncertain solution. An alternative route would be for courts or legislators to limit potential punitive damages, and restrict any charges to the costs of repairing or compensating for the harm done. Even then, some liabilities may be uninsurable - accidents involving nuclear reactors, for example. Equally, companies may find themselves unable to secure adequate insurance against certain risks - terrorism being an obvious case. The UK government picked up the difference between insurance cover and the cost of damage inflicted by terrorist bombs on City of London skyscrapers. It did so, albeit reluctantly, because of concern for the City's future. In this way, governments may be obliged to accept the role of co-insurer where the insurance industry will not accept the full risk. The most practical conclusion, however, is that governments should give more thought to the costs of compliance when they draft legislation. US environmental and asbestos claims have, for example, already wiped out many syndicates at Lloyd's of London. If the Superfund legislation of the US on contaminated land were fully enforced, many companies, insurers and possibly even banks would shut down. The safety net provided by the world's insurance industry cannot be expanded without limit if it is not to tear.</p>

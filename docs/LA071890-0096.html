			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Broad Bonds Classified as Nonperforming: The reclassification of $92 million in  bonds in its investment portfolio in second quarter 1990 showed up in a report  filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> It marked the first time the Los Angeles financial services company has had to  make such a classification. Jana Greer, a spokeswoman, said Broad had set aside  $22 million to cover permanent losses. She added that the company expected the  bonds to recover the $70 million in value not covered by the reserve fund and  that the temporary loss would not have a material impact on Broad's  $7.1-billion investment portfolio.  </P></p>

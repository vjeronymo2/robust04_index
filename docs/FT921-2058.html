			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major and Kinnock outline straight choices A STRAIGHT choice between a party with policies to build a lasting economic recovery and a Conservative administration offering a repeat of the old boom-slump cycle was last night set by Mr Neil Kinnock at the heart of Labour's campaign. But as the two main party leaders brandished their rival agendas at set-piece rallies, Mr John Major put Mr Kinnock's leadership alongside Labour's tax policies as the issues at the heart of the election. In a strong speech to his first rally of the campaign, in Manchester, he joined a growing Conservative attack on Mr Kinnock's fitness to govern. Without mentioning the Labour leader by name he said bluntly: 'We can't afford to be led by people who don't know what their policy on foreign affairs and defence is from one day to the next.' As Labour sought to keep the focus of the campaign on the recession and unemployment, Mr Kinnock, speaking to a rally in Birmingham, rounded on the government's record and pledged that Labour would 'ignite' an early economic recovery. He said that, although the government, which had brought rising unemployment and the fear of unemployment, would not even recognise its existence, the British people did. 'That is why it is essential that the unemployment party is defeated. The Tory government of recession must be replaced by a Labour government for recovery.' Mr Kinnock said Labour's Budget proposals would bring immediate assistance for the economy. 'With each step we take, more orders will be won, more work will be created, and more people will be employed.' Responding to a day of intense Conservative attacks, he said it was not surprising that the Tories did not want to fight on their record. 'Is it any wonder they are spending millions on telling lies about us, instead of telling the truth about themselves?' Mr Major reserved his fiercest words for Labour's plans to abolish the present ceiling on National Insurance contributions. He said that Labour's shadow Budget would 'kick-start not the economy, but the society of class and the philosophy of envy'. Echoing remarks made by Mr Kinnock during the 1983 election, when the Labour leader warned people not to grow old or fall ill if the Conservatives won, Mr Major told his audience that if there were a Labour government: 'I warn you not to be ambitious. I warn you not to be qualified. I warn you not to be self-employed.' He emphasised the harm he said Labour's policies would do to all on lower incomes. Everyone would suffer because the housing market would collapse, with knock-on effects for businesses such as builders, electricians, do-it-yourself shops and garden centres. The rally in Manchester was the first outing for the Pounds 500,000 set devised by Imagination, a theatre set-design company for which Mr Andrew Lloyd Webber was a creative consultant. Party officials, describing the set as spectacular, said that it reflected Mr Major's personality.</p>

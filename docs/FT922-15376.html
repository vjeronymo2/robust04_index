			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Japan cuts discount rate by 0.75 points to 3.75% THE BANK of Japan, the country's central bank, early today cut the official discount rate by 0.75 points to 3.75 per cent in response to the rapid weakening of the Japanese economy. The cut came a day after the Tokyo stock market plunged to its lowest level in five years as investors showed disappointment with a government economic package aimed at stimulating the economy. Share prices fell further in initial trading this morning, with the Nikkei average down nearly 300 points shortly after opening. The rate cut is the biggest since the central bank began to ease monetary policy last summer, when the ODR stood at 6 per cent. It indicates growing concern in the bank over the rapid decline in economic indicators over the past two months. The bank last cut the interest rate in late December, but the reduction has had no appreciable impact on the economy, with industrial output declining and monetary growth at an historic low. News that the cut was coming was leaked to the Japanese press yesterday but stock market investors failed to respond positively. After a slight rise initially, the Nikkei average on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped yesterday by 323.36 on the day to close at 19,345.95 'Sentiment is so poor that I don't think the market would be happy with anything now,' said Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The market is standing more than 50 per cent below the highs reached more than two years ago. The 0.75 point rate cut, compared with earlier cuts of half a point, is likely to be the last reduction for some time. Economists have argued that potential borrowers needed to believe that rates have hit bottom before they will take on fresh debt and increase spending. A cut of this size signals that the Bank of Japan's overriding concern of recent years to control inflation has been replaced by worries about the health of the economy. The government yesterday said its emergency economic measures would boost demand by at least Y4,000bn (Pounds 17bn) in the first half of the fiscal year (which begins today) compared with the same period a year ago. But private economists said increased spending over current budgets in the first half of the year would be much smaller and the actual impact of the package difficult to detect.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 17 (XINHUA) -- The Chinese Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunications is to issue, on April 21, a set  of four stamps featuring desert afforestation.    Designs and denomination of these stamps are: "the vast  expanse of desert", 15 fen; "flowers in the desert", 20 fen;  "forest of diversiform-leaved poplar", 40 fen; and "oasis in the  desert", 50 fen.    Desertification is a serious environmental problem  challenging the whole globe. China has vast areas of desert and  is seriously affected by desertification. At present deserts  constitute 15.9 percent of China's land area.    In recent years China has achieved notable results in  harnessing desertification, with drought-enduring shrubs and  trees, such as the diversiform-leaved poplar, planted to shelter  farmland and stop moving dunes.    So far, some 6.7 million hectares of the country's deserts  have been afforested, and 10 percent of the desertified land has  been effectively harnessed.    The designer of the stamps is Meng Sihui from the Palace  Museum.</p>

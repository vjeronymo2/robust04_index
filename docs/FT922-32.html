			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / TWA in talks with other airlines: Discussions with USAir could involve British Airways BANKRUPT US airline Trans World Airlines (TWA) has held talks recently with another ailing US carrier, USAir, 'and others', according to Mr Carl Icahn, the owner of TWA. However, Mr Icahn described the potential sale of TWA assets to USAir as 'premature', saying that there was no firm offer on the table. He made no specific reference to British Airways, which is rumoured to be a possible investor in the enlarged USAir. Both British Airways and USAir declined to comment. Other sources in the US suggested that talks between the carriers had been underway for several months. 'We are aware that talks have been going on among all three at the same time,' said one party close to the TWA bankruptcy. 'We heard that BA was interested. Something seems to be hotting up.' The TWA branch of the Airline Pilots Association also confirmed that it had some limited, but 'constructive' discussions with representatives from BA and USAir, as well as extensive discussions with TWA's management over the matter. The rumoured deal would involve USAir, which has made heavy losses in recent years, acquiring many of TWA's assets. BA would then recapitalise the expanded USAir business, taking a large minority stake in return. USAir has previously acknowledged merger or acquisition talks with a variety of other carriers, including TWA. In turn, TWA is known to have talked to other possible buyers or partners, such as Continental Airlines. Mr Icahn added that 'alternatives' to the talks with 'USAir and others' were being evaluated. However, there was scepticism yesterday over how quickly or easily such a three-way transaction might be arranged. BA has been scouting the US for some time for a partnership to increase its US market penetration. But the company has indicated it was in no hurry and was also looking for partners in Asia and Europe. Earlier this year, BA and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines unsuccessfully attempted to merge in a deal which might also have involved Northwest Airlines of the US. KLM holds a stake in Northwest. KLM is still regarded as BA's most plausible partner and contacts between the two are expected to be renewed later this year. Lex, Page 18</p>

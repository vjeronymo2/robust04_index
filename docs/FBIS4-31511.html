			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [First part of Ion Cristoiu editorial: "What Has Got Into </F> Mr. Corneliu Coposu"]    [Text] At the recent news conference of the PNTCD  [National Peasant Christian Democratic Party], Corneliu Coposu  said that if his party comes to power, it will modify the  Constitution to be able to bring King Mihai back to the helm of  the country. According to Coposu, the reestablishment of the  monarchy is the only way to save the country from the deep  crisis it is currently facing. The leader of the peasant party  made no secret of his faith in King Mihai. He has affirmed on  several occasions that he sees the king as the only person able  to change the situation in Romania. However, never before has  this belief been expressed so strongly and clearly, and mainly,  it has never been accompanied by explanations about the way in  which the king will be brought back to the throne. Politicians  often use their analytical knowledge on various issues. The  salvation of the country is one of the themes on which they can  fully show their willingness to express an opinion. In the case  of Coposu, we are by no means dealing with an idea that sprang  from the need of the PNTCD leader to be original. No doubt,  here we are witnessing the proclamation of an electoral program.  This is also proved by the fact that after he had revealed it  also at the Paris symposium devoted to exile issues, Coposu  returned to his ideas regarding the monarchy with the same  intensity during the news conference held at home.    The attitude of the opposition parties toward King Mihai so  far has been marked by visible ambiguity. Even Coposu's PNTCD  avoided publicly broaching the issue of King Mihai's return to  Romania as monarch. The explanation for this prudence can be  found in an electoral calculation. All opinion polls so far  have shown the vast majority of the population to be  incontestably republicans. The monarchist part of the  population, even if not too large, showed an electoral  determination that cannot be contradicted by a party without  risk of losing votes. To please both the republican and the  monarchist sides, the opposition parties left the issue of the  position toward King Mihai in suspension. They did not clearly  declare themselves monarchist for fear of losing the votes of  the republican majority. However, they did not declare the act  of bringing the king to Romania as impossible, in order to make  the monarchists believe that, nonetheless, they support his  majesty.    Within this context, Coposu's clear statements struck our  entire political scene with amazement. They surprised both the  right as well as the left. The right was reduced to barely  understandable stammering. ROMANIA LIBERA, the newspaper that  expresses the state of mind of the Romanian right wing but also  of the monarchist part of the population, yesterday [2 June]  published a slightly distraught commentary. With all necessary  precautions, Coposu's position is considered ultimately as being  maybe even dangerous for the political capital of the CDR  [Democratic Convention of Romania]. On the left of our  political spectrum, the stupefaction regarding such a  unambiguous position of the PNTCD leader was equally immense.    On the parties in the government coalition, King Mihai has  the effect of a hot iron rod thrust directly in the ribs. It is  enough for them to hear his name and they start frantic  gesticulations. This time, the leaders of the respective parties  were simply paralyzed. The only reaction from the left was from  Adrian Nastase [leader of the Social Democracy Party of Romania  -- PDSR]. His position makes the echo provoked by Coposu among  the members of the left-wing even more enigmatic. Nastase was  content to consider the declaration as "extremely grave and  serious." The laconic nature of this viewpoint can be explained  certainly through the elements that are strictly connected with  Nastase's personality: a certain elegance in the political  dispute and concern about not being too tough with Corneliu  Coposu, the only right-wing leader who publicly expressed his  sympathy with the PDSR leader. However, at the same time it is  clear that Nastase's laconicism also expresses the preoccupation  not to start making statements on an issue on which the PDSR has  not yet expresses its position.    Thus, the reactions to Corneliu Coposu's statement betray a  profound state of bewilderment. Something along the line: What  has got into Mr. Coposu? Our answer to this question can be  found in the next issue of our newspaper.</p>

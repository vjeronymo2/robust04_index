			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: UAP chief confirms UK plans Mr Jacques Friedmann, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris, France's largest insurance group, yesterday confirmed his interest in acquiring a UK non-life insurance operation. He said he hoped to reach a decision by the end of the year. 'We are looking, but we are only interested in buying a good company which doesn't need restructuring,' said Mr Friedmann. He said the investment would not be on the scale of UAP's previous European acquisitions, and ruled out a hostile bid for a UK company. Over the past 10 years, UAP has undergone substantial expansion in Europe, bringing Royal Belge, Sun Life of the UK and Colonia of Germany under its control. The UK non-life sector is now 'the only hole in our network', according to Mr Friedmann. He expressed concern about the possible impact of depressed French and international share and bond markets on this year's earnings. However, he stuck to his forecast of a significant increase in net profits, compared with the FFr1.42bn (Dollars 263.9m) posted in 1993. The UAP chairman said the group was well-placed to benefit from the introduction of the single European insurance market: it is already offering two new products - Pan Euro Life and Pan Euro Risk - across Europe. In the French market, Mr Friedmann said the introduction of a system of private pension funds would create an important, if competitive, new market.</p>

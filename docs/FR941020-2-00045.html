Evaluation of ASHI as an Accreditation Organization Under CLIA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ASHI has formally applied for approval as an accreditation organization under CLIA. We have evaluated the ASHI application to determine equivalency with our implementing and enforcement regulations, and the deeming/exemption requirements of the CLIA rules. We also verified the organization's assurance that it requires the laboratories it accredits to be, and that the organization is, in compliance with the following subparts of 42 CFR part 493 as explained below: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart E_Accreditation by a Private, Nonprofit Accreditation Organization or Exemption Under an Approved State Laboratory Program <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ASHI has submitted, for the specialty of histocompatibility, a comparison of individual accreditation and condition level requirements, a description of its inspection process, PT monitoring process, and its data management and analysis system, a listing of the size, composition, education and experience of its inspection teams, its investigative and complaint response procedures, its notification agreements with HCFA, its removal or withdrawal of laboratory accreditation procedures, its current list of accredited laboratories, and its announced and unannounced inspection process. We have determined that ASHI has complied with the general requirements under &sect;493.501, the applicable parts of &sect;493.506, and the CLIA requirements for approval as an accreditation organization under various subparts of part 493. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart H_Participation in Proficiency Testing for Laboratories Performing Tests of Moderate or High Complexity, or Both <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ASHI's requirements for PT are more stringent than those of CLIA. All of ASHI's accredited laboratories are required to participate in a cell exchange or PT program for all tests. CLIA, however, does not require laboratories that perform histocompatibility testing to participate in an HHS-approved PT program. We have determined that ASHI currently imposes, and will continue to impose, action upon its accredited laboratories that are unsuccessful in a cell exchange or PT performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

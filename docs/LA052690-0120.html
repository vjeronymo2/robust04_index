			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE ALLEGES NEGLIGENCE BY DOCTOR  </P> <P> The Medical Board of California has accused a Santa Ana doctor, Rajendra Desai,  of gross negligence for allegedly prescribing the wrong drugs, overprescribing  drugs and general incompetence, especially when caring for seriously ill cancer  patients.  </P> <P> Deputy Atty. Gen. Heidi R. Weisbaum, who is seeking to revoke or suspend his  medical license, said Friday that some of Desai's patients were given "too much  chemotherapy," leaving them more depleted than before Desai's care began.  </P> <P> The 67-year-old Desai, who recently retired from a 38-year practice in oncology  and hematology, was said to be traveling and could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Weisbaum noted that Desai had formally contested the Medical Board's  accusation. She said the case will probably be heard in September in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> A board official said the investigation began two years ago after the medical  executive committee at Coastal Communities Hospital in Santa Ana revoked  Desai's staff privileges.  </P> <P> The board official said Coastal's action came after "it was determined that  Desai's medical management contributed to the patients' death" in seven of 11  cases that were reviewed.  </P> <P> In compliance with state law, Coastal Communities forwarded a copy of its  disciplinary action to the Medical Board, and its civil case began.  </P> <P> The board was also notified, the official said, when Desai was disciplined in  1982 and again in 1984 by Fountain Valley Hospital, which required that his  admissions be monitored by another doctor.  </P> <P> In its seven-page accusation, the board described Desai's care of 11 patients  in 1986 and 1987. Two suffered "extremely serious" brain tumors. Others  suffered breast or other forms of cancer, and several had blood disorders.  </P> <P> In the case of a patient identified as Fred K., a 47-year-old man with  renal-cell carcinoma, the board charged that Desai administered 6 million units  of the anti-cancer drug Interferon at the same time as three other powerful  drugs. The drugs were supposed to be administered sequentially, the board said.  </P> <P> After receiving his medical degree from Bombay University in India in 1949,  Desai worked at New England Center Hospital in Boston, where he was a Fulbright  Scholar in hematology and oncology from 1952-1955.  </P> <P> He told the medical board that he served as a Stanford University research  fellow in hematology from 1957 to 1962. And he came to Orange County in 1965 to  serve as chairman of hematology/oncology at Orange County Medical Center, the  county hospital later sold to UC Irvine. A member of the Orange County Medical  Assn., Desai has been in private practice here since 1969.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Political Talk" column by Shih Chun-yu (2457 0689 3768): </F> "Manmade Tension on Korean Peninsula"]    [Text] Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa arrived in  Beijing yesterday on another shuttle-diplomacy visit concerning  the Korean issue. Several days ago, high-ranking officials of  Japan, South Korea, the DPRK, and the United States visited each  other's countries to discuss the question of nuclear inspections.  <H5>  The United States and Japan Dispute Sanctions </H5>   The day before yesterday, foreign ministry officials of the  United States, Japan, and South Korea held talks in Seoul to  discuss the imposition of economic sanctions on the DPRK. Their  conclusion was that sanctions should be imposed gradually. This  is different from the U.S. earlier strong position. According  to Japanese papers, Japan has disputed the question with the  United States and favors the immediate adoption of such harsh  measures as cutting off remittances sent from Koreans in Japan.    In the coming weeks, the United States reportedly is to seek  UN Security Council approval of "moderate" sanctions, including  the suspension of scientific, technological, and cultural  exchanges, as well as of UN aid. All this generally will mean  nothing to the DPRK, which has met with U.S. sanctions ever  since the Korean War. Moreover, coupled with its foreign policy,  the DPRK is comparatively isolated diplomatically and is  accustomed to self-reliance and maintaining a closed door. It  will not take such insignificant sanctions seriously at all.  <H5>  U.S. Visitor's Message </H5>   After returning from Pyongyang, Harrison, a Korean-issue  expert of the U.S. Carnegie Organization, had this impression:  Korean leaders take the sanctions very lightly. Judging from  past experience, international sanctions have not played a very  large role in Third World countries, examples being Iraq,  Serbia, and Haiti. The sanctions will be even less effective  for the DPRK.    Another noteworthy message Harrison brought back is that Kim  Il-song is reported to have told him that he is willing to  freeze the DPRK's nuclear program in exchange for U.S.  diplomatic recognition. This does not sound unreliable.    The DPRK has shown signs of opening its door in recent  years.  Although the door gap is not large, air from the outside has  kept coming in. Pyongyang repeatedly has expressed to the  United States its wish to bury the hatchet and establish ties.  This is a great trend in the wake of the Cold War. The United  States, fettered by old concepts and thinking that the DPRK is  one of the few remaining communist countries, wants to exert  pressure to make it collapse. Thus it has made an unsolvable  question out of an otherwise insignificant matter. It even does  not hesitate to adopt a brink-of-war policy.  <H5>  Both Seoul and Pyongyang Are Calm </H5>   One phenomenon should be enlightening: While the United  States is exaggerating the matter as being so serious that a  Korean war might break out at any minute, both Seoul and  Pyongyang are calm. A BBC correspondent reported from Seoul  that residents had not the slightest fear and that there was no  panic purchase in supermarkets, which are the "barometer of  fear." Harrison and another British reporter said that life in  Pyongyang is normal. Residents in Japan are even less affected.  The tension is manmade.    U.S. President Clinton's Asia policy has been criticized  extensively for wishing, on the one hand, to improve relations  with this region, with its speedily developing economies, while  on the other hand, acting as a bully in an overbearing manner or  "acting as an international housekeeper, if not a bully"  (Assistant Secretary of State Lord's words). Now that the  United States has changed its policy on the granting of MFN  status to China, its attitude toward Japan, India, and Singapore  has changed too. Some media have maintained that one day, U.S.  policy for Asia will change and become pragmatic. Whether or  not this is true remains subject to further observation.</p>

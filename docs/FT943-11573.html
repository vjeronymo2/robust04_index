			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / Observer: Iri comes again No one was more surprised than Michele Tedeschi himself when he was chosen to chair Iri, Italy's giant state holding company. He hadn't been gone long. It was only last year that the 54-year-old lawyer was pushed sideways from the chief executive slot at Iri and sent to manage Stet, the telecoms utility. At that time, the Ciampi government had hauled back Prof Romano Prodi, the Bologna economist, to act as chairman of Iri and accelerate privatisation. There is a bit of a pattern here, because Prodi was also a repeat performance, having been in charge of Iri between 1982 and 1989. First time around he felt his political masters had obstructed plans for proper reform. At his next shot, he only had 12 months before the Berlusconi government took office, whereupon he left, expressing his fears that the new rightwing coalition would allow him insufficient rein. In being recalled, this time as overall boss, Tedeschi sees himself as a technocrat who has spent more than 25 years working in-house at Iri. But his is also a political appointment and his fate is likely to be tied to that of the government.</p>

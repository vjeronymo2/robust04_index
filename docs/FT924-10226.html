			<p>921102 FT  02 NOV 92 / International Company News: Critchley listing with Pounds 25m value CRITCHLEY GROUP, which makes products that help identify wires and cables used in industrial applications, is set to join the trickle of companies seeking a stock market listing. Later this month, the company will seek a placing likely to raise up to Pounds 15m, valuing the Stroud-based concern at about Pounds 25m and raising Pounds 3m of new money for development. Critchley's makes small plastic collar sleeves printed with numbers and letters which assemblers use to identify the spaghetti of wires that go into industrial control systems. But what is interesting is the range of projects it is involved in, Mr Ian McCallum, the managing director, says. 'The strength of the business is the range of industries that we serve - energy, aerospace, industrial controls and utilities. We supply the haberdashery items of the electrical industry.' Products appear on the new Rolls-Royce Trent engine for Boeing and Airbus; it is on Elf Enterprise Consortium's Piper B platform; and it is used on control control systems at BNF's Sellafield plant. Critchley made its first cable marker 40 years ago and sales are still growing. Last year it produced profits of Pounds 2.26m from sales of Pounds 19.24m and trading has continued strongly in the first half of this year. The most interesting development is a heat shrinkable identification label. It fulfils a similar task as the plastic sleeves but is targetted at the most sophisticated end of the electrical market. These HSI label now account for more than 40 per cent of all sales of identification business. Critchley also has an array of products that fix, bind and manage wires. A less interesting part of the business is Critchley Wound Components in Nottingham, which makes small transformers for the communications and data communications industries and which accounts for about 15 per cent of sales. The business is mature, 'a job shop' adding value by selling labour, says Mr Christopher Humphrey, finance director. Although the business depresses group operating profits it will be supported as it is profitable and cash generative About 38 per cent of group sales are abroad, either sourced from the UK or from plant that has been built or bought abroad. The group is likely to focus expansion and the small 'war chest' it is building with the placing on the cable identification part of the business. 'Identification is the most exciting area of growth,' says Mr McCallum. 'Everything in industry has to be labelled and there is a de-skilling on the factory floor.' Critchley started life over 100 years ago. In response to a hostile approach from then independent M K Electric in 1984, Mr McCallum led a consortium of institutions, including MAM and Midland Montagu, which supplied 60 per cent of the capital in a Pounds 4.5m buy-out. The management will share about Pounds 1.5m of the proceeds of the placement and will be left with 11 per cent of the company. Critchley estimates the institutions will sell about 50% of their holdings. Impact day is expected to be in late November.</p>

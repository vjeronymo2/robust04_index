			<p><P> December 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MENTAL-HEALTH RIGHTS MOVEMENT  </P> <P> Isaac blames the catastrophe of homelessness among mentally ill people on the  counterculture and the New Left of the '60s. She is furious that mentally ill  people have some rights, such as the right to due process before being  subjected to hospitalization or forced to take very strong and potentially  dangerous drugs.  </P> <P> The evidence is overwhelming that when mentally ill people are offered  intensive, comprehensive but voluntary programs that allow them some dignity as  people, the vast majority participate.  </P> <P> Homelessness is tragic for a mentally ill person. But we will be deluding  ourselves if we follow Isaac's advice and believe we can solve the problem not  by providing housing, support and treatment but by taking away people's rights.  </P> <P> LEONARD S. RUBENSTEIN  </P> <P> Washington  </P></p>

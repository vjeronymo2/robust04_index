			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Arts: Elton John/Eric Clapton - Pop Eric and Elton held a party last weekend and 200,000 friends turned up. You could tell they were friends because they did not mind that it was all a bit cosy, slightly sedate, and not much of a rave. Elton John is much more sombre figure these days. OK, so not many 45-year-olds wear canary yellow jackets and diamante waistcoats, but for a man who used to appear in public dressed like the sugar plum fairy it was the soul of restrained elegance. His set was also stripped bare - just black keyboards behind which Elton seemed as restrained as a bank clerk. Once this functional machine did spiral upwards like a demented cinema Wurlitzer, but in the main Elton was not the clown of old. The sad songs, which littered his repertoire, were almost painfully apt. Elton was also hampered by a sound system more suited to Guns 'N' Roses than to one of the most lyrical giants of pop. Some of the faster numbers were loud to the point of incomprehension. But there were still shivery moments, especially 'Sorry seems to be the hardest word' and 'Rocket man', and for once the songs off the new album, especially 'The One', held their own. Just when it seemed Elton was warming to his work there was a blistering 'Saturday night's alright for fighting' and he was gone. Before the end he had been joined by Eric Clapton for one of the most costly duets of all time in their joint country rocker, 'Runaway Train'. Soemhow the sight of these two multi millionaires still working their way was re-assuring: pop stars can grow old gracefully. On Friday, the first of three nights, Clapton had the easier option of closing the show. He has never majored on personality - his guitar virtuosity shouts his presence loudly enough. He touched the memory chords of his audience in a dreamy kind of way and, with matchless precision, called down dusk on cue with 'Wonderful Tonight'. Eric and Elton did not lay on the most exciting party but it was certainly extremely agreeable.</p>

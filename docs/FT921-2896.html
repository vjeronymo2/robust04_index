			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Economists Give Their Ratings UBS PHILLIPS &amp; DREW Score: 1 out of 10 THE spending measures are strangely focused for a party which seeks to use fiscal policy to boost the economy's long-term growth rate. What role do higher child benefit or extra pensions play in that? The abolition of the national insurance contributions ceiling is in itself a useful taxation measure but the implications of the top rate of income tax and national insurance contributions will probably undermine the work efforts of the higher-paid and to that extent undermine the supply potential of the economy. Industrial measures were too small-scale. PETER SPENCER - SHEARSON LEHMAN Score 7 out of 10 I GIVE it two cheers. It is a prudent Budget remaining within the limits set by the government's own Budget proposals. It maintains the safety net of the ERM and as such there is little in this to worry the financial markets. In terms of income distribution the Budget casts Mr Smith in the guise of a latter day Robin Hood - taking from the rich, and not so very rich, to give to the not so poor. You have to have a taxable income to benefit from this - the very poor don't do so well. Its main failing is that it does very little to help boost confidence and promote economic recovery. DAVID KERN - NATWEST BANK Score 5 out of 10 BASICALLY an unsurprising shadow Budget which confirms the perception of John Smith as a competent and fundamentally prudent potential chancellor. This is underlined by the net tax increase of Pounds 1.8bn. However, the statement leaves some big question marks. It is not at all clear what assumption Labour is making about privatisation receipts, and although there was a commitment to staying in the ERM, the statement did not address the widespread anxieties in the City that Labour might devalue. KEVIN GARDINER - SG WARBURG SECURITIES Score 5 out of 10 ONE point higher than Lamont but only just. There is as much consumption going on but it is different people doing the consuming. It is a redistributional Budget with a macro framework, not much different from last week's Budget. The overall tone should be reassuring to the markets. It is quite encouraging to have an opposition party quantify its proposals in a reasonably systematic way. Also welcome is the restatement of the commitment to the ERM, and that there are no plans to borrow more than the present government.</p>

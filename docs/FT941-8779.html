			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Hariri urges Assad to rein in Hizbollah Mr Rafik Hariri, Lebanon's prime minister, held talks in Damascus yesterday in an effort to persuade Syria's President Hafez al-Assad to prevail upon Hizbollah fighters to curb intensified violence in south Lebanon which has raised the threat of a punitive Israeli military operation. Mr Hariri's trip followed the Lebanese government's receipt of a letter from Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, in which he warned that the renewed violence in the south was 'very dangerous' and risked 'torpedoing' the resumed peace talks between Israel, Syria and Lebanon in Washington. Syria exerts considerable influence, if not control, over the pro-Iranian Hizbollah, which Mr Assad considers a valuable card in his peace negotiations with Israel. Syria, under intense US and Israeli pressure, last July agreed to curb Hizbollah activity after a series of rocket attacks into north Israel prompted a massive week-long bombardment of dozens of villages in south Lebanon. Skirmishes continued at a lower level inside Israel's self-declared 'security zone' in south Lebanon, but then escalated significantly earlier this month when Hizbollah fighters killed four Israeli soldiers in an ambush. Israel retaliated with three air raids into south Lebanon. On Wednesday Hizbollah fired a Katyusha rocket into northern Israel for the first time since the pro-Iranian group reached its 'gentleman's agreement' last July to restrict all attacks against Israel and its proxies to within the 'security zone'. The rocket damaged a factory, but no-one was reported injured. Israel has called on the Lebanese government to disarm Hizbollah. Mr Hariri and his government have repeatedly said they cannot and will not do so while Israeli forces continue to occupy parts of south Lebanon.</p>

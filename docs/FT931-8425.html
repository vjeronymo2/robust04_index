			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith and Ashdown round on Major LABOUR and Liberal Democrat MPs mounted a sustained onslaught against Mr John Major, the prime minister, in the Commons yesterday, accusing him of personal responsibility for allowing unemployment in Britain to exceed 3m again, Ivor Owen writes. During furious exchanges Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, charged the prime minister with standing 'idly by' as the numbers out of work increased during each month of his tenancy of 10 Downing Street. Renewed assurances that the government was determined to bring down unemployment were brushed aside by Mr Smith, who called in vain for Mr Major to repudiate the 'heartless' comment by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that unemployment was a price 'well worth paying' for bringing inflation down. To government cheers, Mr Major insisted that there was no purpose in Labour MPs expressing concern about unemployment when they were committed to policies that would put more people out of work. Before lecturing the government, he said, they should drop their support for the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, the introduction of a minimum wage and a 'windfall tax' on the profits of the privatised utilities. But Mr Smith said it was 'economic madness as well as a social tragedy' that unemployment had again exceeded 3m. He attacked the prime minister for seeking to evade his responsibility. Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, joined in the assault on the prime minister and demanded: 'Why is it that you always use your time telling us what the opposition say instead of what you are going to do?'</p>

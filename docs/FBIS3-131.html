The remains of the completed forms, with photographs and  fingerprints, were found in the yard of a Home Affairs office in  Lenasia, near Johannesburg. They have been seen and  photographed by the MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN. The ID applications are  largely those of African domestic workers and the residents of  three squatter camps in the Lenasia area. The ANC [African  National Congress] says they are likely to be ANC supporters.  "This has very serious implications. It can suppress our  capacity to muster votes," said Issu Chiba, chairman of the  local ANC branch.    The IEC confirmed that the documents were authentic and not  "innocent refuse". The IEC is now investigating whether Home  Affairs officials are sabotaging the process or guilty of  "inefficiency and negligence". A Home Affairs representative  said if the allegations were proven to be true, the department  would take "the strongest possible steps" against the staff  responsible. The find follows a SUNDAY NATION expose last  August of Home Affairs officials in Barberton, Eastern  Transvaal, who had burnt a pile of ID books. ANC  secretary-general Cyril Ramaphosa called this "gross sabotage of  the elections process".    This week the ANC called for independent monitoring of the  issuing of IDs and temporary voter cards in the run-up to the  elections. The latest find took place when Lenasia ANC branch  member Batista Mokwena investigated complaints from applicants  who had waited months for their IDs and found the application  forms and other documents in a bin at the Home Affairs offices.    The torn-up application forms had been filled out,  fingerprinted, stamped and signed by clerks before being thrown  away. Other documents of applicants, including original birth  certificates and photographs, were also discarded. Mokwena had  been posted outside the Home Affairs office to assist droves of  people plying ANC branch offices with requests for help in  applying for IDs. He discovered the discarded forms after  investigating the large number of applicants who had been told  there was no record of their applications.    Most of the destroyed applications were made in January and  February this year and appear to belong primarily to domestic  workers and squatter residents from three squatter camps in the  area. Both the Department of Home Affairs and the IEC have sent  investigating teams to Lenasia and much of the evidence has  already been handed over to the commission. Complaints about  the Home Affairs staffers in Lenasia surfaced early this year.  Shan Balton, of the local ANC branch, met Home Affairs  officials in January to complain that most of the Lenasia clerks  did not speak a vernacular language and that free photographs  were not being provided.    "The problems did not stop and we decided to put a volunteer  in the Home Affairs office to assist with forms," said Balton.  "If this is happening in Lenasia, what's happening in small  rural towns?" He added: "There is a problem with the absolute  control that Home Affairs has over the issuing of IDs and  temporary voter cards. They need independent people in the  offices."</p>

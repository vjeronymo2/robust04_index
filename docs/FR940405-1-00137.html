			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule (58 FR 28194 at 28248 to 28250), the agency tentatively suggested that a testing method similar to the one described by Lowe et al. (Ref. 2) could be used to demonstrate that a sunscreen drug product provides protection against UVA radiation. This method uses 48- and 72-hour erythema reactions and 12- to 14-day melanogenesis in skin sensitized with 8-methoxsalen (8&hyph;MOP). However, because the agency did not have enough information or data to propose a method for determining UVA protection in the proposed rule, the agency stated that a method should be developed and validated in the same manner as was the sunscreen testing procedure for protection against ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation (i.e., sunscreen protection factor (SPF) testing). Furthermore, the agency requested comments and data regarding an appropriate testing methodology for OTC sunscreen drug products that afford UVA protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency received a substantial amount of comments, data, and information regarding UVA ingredients, claims, and testing procedures. After evaluating the submitted material, the agency finds that there are two basic interrelated questions regarding testing procedures for determining UVA protection that must be addressed before the agency can complete its assessment of appropriate UVA ingredients and claims. These questions are:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) What action spectrum best describes the biological risk of UVA radiation (i.e., which ultraviolet radiation wavelengths are most likely to cause biological damage), and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Which testing procedure best defines the UVA protection provided by a sunscreen drug product?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> I. Action Spectra for UVA-Related Skin Damage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several comments discussed the appropriate action spectrum for biological risk associated with UVA radiation. One comment stated that, in developing a consensus regarding an acceptable assay for determining the UVA protection provided by a sunscreen drug product, the specific UVA effect that is to be blocked must be considered. These effects include UVA erythema, UVA-induced drug photosensitivity, immediate pigment darkening, delayed tanning, or other effects of photodamage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that several action spectra describing different aspects of solar-induced skin damage have been determined in a number of different species and cell types. The comment described these aspects as photocarcinogenesis, DNA damage, photoaging, mutagenicity, and immunosuppression. The comment maintained that each action spectrum for UV-induced damage closely tracks the human erythemal action spectrum. The comment stated that the best summary of the biological risk of UV light has been published by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) (Ref. 3). The CIE Hazard Spectrum embodies the comprehensive, yet normal, risks to human skin due to full-spectrum UV exposure and reflects the findings of the action spectra biological responses to UV described above. The CIE Hazard Spectrum shows that the damage risk for UVB at 290 nm is 100 times higher than that at 320 nm. The damage risk at 320 nm is 100 times higher than that at 400 nm. The damage risk at 320 nm is at least 10 times greater than the damage risk at 340 nm. This spectrum shows that the most damage potential is in the UVB wavelengths (290 to 320 nm), followed by the shorter UVA wavelengths (320 to 340 nm). The comment cited numerous scientific articles and submitted action spectra to support its statements (Ref. 4).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another comment stated that although protection against UVA is important, it is not as important as protection against UVB. The comment argued that, based on the CIE Hazard Spectrum, the UVB wavelengths contribute 80 to 85 percent of the damage risk in sunlight, while UVA contributes 15 to 20 percent of the damage risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One comment stated that some known effects on humans caused by UVA radiation include: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Photoaging of the skin, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) UVA-induced hypersensitivities, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Augmentation of skin cancers, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Erythema. However, the comment noted that there is no single known action spectrum to describe which parts of the UVA spectrum are most active in causing these effects. Therefore, the comment maintained that it is not appropriate to use the UVA-erythema action spectrum for testing purposes. The comment stated that UVA protection should be assessed in relation to UVB protection and that the assumption should be made that all wavelengths are equally important.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931006 FT  06 OCT 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans lose interest in sowing cotton - The decline of the famed sea island fibre A COMBINATION of apathetic farmers, rows among investors and legal disputes over trademarks has denied four eastern Caribbean islands of the benefits of increasing demand for a unique and costly type of cotton that they once produced in substantial quantities. Despite the efforts of some governments and farmers' organisations, there appears little prospect that the islands will again produce the famed sea island cotton in quantities that will satisfy the demand in the world's fashion centres, where ties, shirts and suits made from the product are commanding higher and higher prices. 'There has been a general decline in the production of sea island cotton in the Caribbean, although there is continuing high demand for the product, particularly in Japan,' says Mr John Spence, an agronomist who specialises in sea island cotton production in the eastern Caribbean. 'The decline is linked with the fact that in the Caribbean today, agriculture is not a happy pursuit. Any real expansion of production will take some time.' The government of Barbados, the leading producer of the four producing islands - Barbados, Antigua, St Kitts and Montserrat - has been attempting to raise the interest of farmers in the production of sea island cotton as part of wider efforts to diversify agriculture on the island, which is based mainly on the production of sugar cane. 'There is now a different problem as, while prices are up, farmers are uncertain about stepping into another form of agriculture,' says Mr Spence. He explains that cotton is less hardy than cane, and demands greater attention and care from farmers. Many farmers consider this higher degree of husbandry as not being worth the effort. 'With cotton one needs to establish the proper infrastructure, and much of this has been missing. The plant is easily affected by pests, a closed season is needed for the crop and the entire industry needs to be regulated.' In the 1950s there were more than 5,000 hectares under sea island cotton in the four islands; this year the crop is growing on only about 200ha. The problems troubling the potentially lucrative industry are illustrated by the failure of one plan to raise production. Eight years ago the government of Guyana, located on the north-eastern shoulder of South America, offered to provide 40,000ha for a joint venture with the four islands to produce sea island cotton. But the project was aborted when it was revealed that, legally, the term 'sea island cotton' could be applied only to the product grown in specified islands in the eastern Caribbean. 'Sea island cotton is different from all others in that it has the longest and finest fibre in the world,' explains Mr Spence. 'It can be spun into the world's finest yarns to make the best fabrics. There have been one or two cases in which there have been attempts to equate cotton from other parts of the world with sea island cotton. Some Egyptian and some Indian cotton have some of the qualities of sea island cotton. But the only pure sea island cotton is grown in the West Indian islands.' There has been foreign interest in kick-starting production of the prized fibre in significant quantities. Japanese investors have offered to buy 500,000lb of the product each year from Caribbean producers, but farmers could not guarantee consistent delivery in such quantities. The four islands established a company, in which Scothalls of Canada was a major investor, with a plan to spin cotton and produce fabric and garments in the region. Faltering production and disagreements among the partners over management practices left the venture unable to meet its targets. The small quantities being produced in the eastern Caribbean are being sold to Japanese trading houses. All spinning and weaving of sea island cotton is done in Japan. The faltering industry has also been adversely affected by legal arguments over the use of the sea island cotton trademark. Producers have alleged that US companies have attempted to pass off high quality Egyptian cotton as the sea island product. 'Because demand is high and production is low, there will always be an opportunity for some people to claim that what they have is the genuine product,' says a former Barbadian cotton farmer. 'There is a good market for the product but farmers have long memories and the earlier problems do not encourage many to jump into cotton production.'</p>

			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Nato to study boosting UN mission in Bosnia Britain reacted coolly yesterday to French proposals for reinforcing the UN mission in Bosnia, saying military experts would have to decide what was feasible. However, military commanders from the nine Nato members which contribute troops to Bosnia, plus the US and Italy, will meet in the Netherlands next week to consider ways of strengthening the UN's hard-pressed humanitarian and peacekeeping mission. The French suggestions - which include securing Sarajevo airport and creating a secure route from the Bosnian capital to the Adriatic - would serve the twin purpose of reinforcing the UN while it remains in Bosnia and making a withdrawal easier. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said he could not comment on the practicability of the French ideas until they had been examined by military experts. He stressed that there could be no question of altering the UN's mandate. Yesterday's meeting of Nato defence ministers grouped the US, Canada and 13 of its European allies but not France, which has opted out of the alliance's military wing. The meeting focused strongly on refining contingency plans for a possible UN withdrawal from Bosnia, although diplomats stressed a pullout was not desirable or imminent. As sketched out in a blueprint drawn up by Nato military planners, a withdrawal of UN forces from Bosnia would be much the most ambitious military operation in which the alliance has been involved. Planners estimate that up to 45,000 troops would be required, of which 25,000 would be earmarked for combat roles, plus 70 combat aircraft, 80 tanks and 180 helicopters. Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, yesterday reaffirmed Washington would provide up to half the combat troops, with conditions: command of any withdrawal operations would have to be transferred unconditionally from the UN to Nato; the total force would have to be large enough to intimidate any hostile party; and the US Congress would have to approve. US officials said they hoped a new UN posture would be worked out and approved by the end of next week.</p>

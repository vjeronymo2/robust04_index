			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Learmonth &amp; Burchett in the black with Pounds 0.3m LEARMONTH &amp; Burchett Management Systems (LBMS), a computing services company quoted on the USM and specialising in computer aided systems engineering (CASE), returned to profit for the year ended April 30 1992 after a disastrous 1990-91. It made pre-tax profits of Pounds 303,000 compared with losses of Pounds 1.7m the year before. Turnover was up 10 per cent at Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 19.5m) and earnings per share worked out at 0.7p, compared with 10.5p losses. No dividend is being recommended. Mr Rainer Burchett, LBMS chairman, said that the company still had Pounds 1.8m of borrowings and that it was premature to talk of paying a dividend in 1992 although it could be possible next year. LBMS, established in 1977, is one of the oldest companies in the CASE area. CASE involves methods and software technologies which make it simpler and more efficient to write computer programmes. LBMS had a sound business record until two years ago when a combination of heavy spending on research and development, acquisitions that proved difficult to digest, increased competition and the recession resulted in a sharp decline into loss. Mr Burchett said that the investment in research and development had resulted in new CASE software which had been well received in the market place. In addition cost cutting and restructuring coupled with improved sales and marketing had resulted in a substantial improvement. The company has a blue chip list of clients and has expanded into the US and Australia.</p>

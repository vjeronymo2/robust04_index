			<p><P> August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AGENCY TRIES TO MAKE 2 TESTIFY ON NEIL BUSH;  </P> <P> S&amp;LS: REGULATORS WANT THE EX-THRIFT OFFICIALS TO RELATE THEIR DISCUSSIONS  WITH THE PRESIDENT'S SON ABOUT POSSIBLE CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.  </P> <P> Federal regulators are seeking subpoenas to compel testimony about Neil Bush by  two former top executives of the failed Denver thrift where the President's son  served as a director, according to documents issued Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bush has been charged in an administrative proceeding with violating  conflict-of-interest rules for failing to disclose his business ties with two  Denver developers, Bill L. Walters and Kenneth M. Good, who were major  customers at Silverado Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Assn. The two men defaulted  on $130 million in loans from Silverado, contributing to the eventual  insolvency of the S&amp;L and its takeover by the government.  </P> <P> Federal regulators want Michael Wise, former Silverado chairman and chief  executive, and Russell M. Murray, former executive vice president, to testify  under oath about their discussions with Bush concerning possible  conflict-of-interest issues.  </P> <P> Wise said he will invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against  self-incrimination and refuse to answer any questions about the President's  son, according to documents issued Tuesday by the federal Office of Thrift  Supervision.  </P> <P> There is a contradiction between a letter that Wise signed and testimony from  Bush. Wise prepared a letter in 1985 to preferred shareholders and directors,  saying that Bush "has agreed to abstain from any board consideration regarding  Silverado's relationship with Mr. Walters or Mr. Good . . ." The letter was  written just before Bush joined the Silverado board.  </P> <P> Bush insists that he never made such a promise. "I did not agree with Wise to  abstain from any board considerations regarding Silverado's relations with  Walters or Good . . . ," he said in written testimony released Tuesday.  </P> <P> Wise told Congress that he could not recall sending the letter.  </P> <P> Also made public was testimony from two men who served on Silverado's board  with Bush. They stated that they did not know the extent of Bush's dealings  with Walters, links that the OTS charges amounted to conflicts of interest  because Bush voted on transactions involving Walters.  </P> <P> "I do not recall knowing that Mr. Walters was a partner in Mr. Bush's oil and  gas exploration company," said Richard J. Bunchman, a Breckenridge, Colo., real  estate operator. He said he also did not know that Cherry Creek National Bank,  whose majority shareholder was Walters, had extended more than $1 million in  credit to Bush's firm or that Bush's company owed Walter's company -- and later  Walters personally -- $100,000.  </P> <P> Richard F. Vitkus, a West Hartford, Conn., lawyer, also said that he did not  recall Bush disclosing to the Silverado board those ties to Walters.  </P> <P> In his testimony, submitted Monday, Bush said he had not disclosed to Silverado  directors Walters Petroleum's 6.25% interest in his oil exploration firm. He  also did not disclose his firm's subsequent indebtedness to Walters Petroleum  or to Cherry Creek National Bank, or his personal guarantee of part of the  firm's debt to the bank.  </P> <P> "I never considered these facts material to the board's consideration," Bush  wrote.  </P> <P> The government wants Murray, the former Silverado executive, subpoenaed to  relate his discussions with Bush about a proposed $900,000 line of credit at  Silverado. Bush sought the money on behalf of Good International, a firm  controlled by Kenneth Good. Bush's oil exploration firm, JNB, was affiliated  with Good International in a plan to do business in Argentina.  </P></p>

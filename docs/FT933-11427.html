			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / International Company News: Chrysler lifted by surge in sales CHRYSLER, the US car manufacturer, yesterday announced a near quadrupling of second-quarter net earnings, driven by surging sales of new products in the North American market. The company, which two years ago was financially strained, underscored its return to financial health with net earnings of Dollars 685m, or Dollars 1.86 a share, compared with Dollars 178m, or 54 cents, in the same period of last year. Sales rose to Dollars 11.03bn from Dollars 9.31bn. The latest quarter included post-tax gains of Dollars 71m from the sale of stock in Mitsubishi Motors, the Japanese car company, and Dollars 39m from the sale of its Acustar Plastics operation. The company said that excluding these items its pre-tax profits totalled Dollars 951m, its highest quarterly total. Mr Robert Eaton, the chairman, said Chrysler had an extremely strong quarter marked by 'tremendous market acceptance for our new products'. Retail sales of mini-vans, trucks and Jeep vehicles remained strong and growing demand for the company's new LH range of cars - the Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision and Chrysler Concorde - had added to profits and market share. The company had continued to focus on better quality, waste elimination and continuous improvement in all areas of the business. Chrysler's combined North American retail car and truck market share was up 2.1 points over the same quarter of 1992. The group's financial services subsidiary reported net earnings of Dollars 44m, down from Dollars 49m last year. For the six months, Chrysler reported a net loss of Dollars 3.47bn, or Dollars 10.38 a share, against earnings of Dollars 165m, or 46 cents, due to a one-time non-cash charge of Dollars 4.68bn for a change in accounting for retiree healthcare.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> c. Organics_Wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i. The Universal Treatment Standards Promulgated in Today's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The set of wastewater UTS proposed in September 1993 was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> virtually identical to the F039 wastewater standards promulgated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Third Third Rule. Applying UTS to F- and K- listed wastes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes organic constituent wastewater standards in a handful of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> codes (F024, K001, K011/13/14, K015, K040, K038, K036, K037,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> K060, K099, K103/104, and U051). Commenters raised specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns with three of the organic wastewater treatment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, and EPA is revising the proposed standards for two of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the three constituents: the wastewater standard proposed for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carbon disulfide will change from 0.014 mg/l to 3.8 mg/l, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed wastewater universal treatment standard for 1,4-dioxane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has been withdrawn. Changes to the treatment standards for these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two constituents is explained in the following section. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third constituent was acetonitrile. Monsanto, Dupont, Cytec and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other acrylonitrile producers, together with the Chemical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufacturing Association's Acrylonitrile Group, objected to EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> extending the UTS to acrylonitrile production wastes K011, K013  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and K014. Their comments stated that the acetonitrile wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> UTS was unachievably low in acrylonitrile wastes. The Agency is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgating an acetonitrile UTS of 5.6 based on steam stripping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performance data. This level also appears achievable by WAO (wet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air oxidation) followed by PACT@ (a combination of powdered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activated carbon treatment and activated sludge).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> ii. Treatment Standard Modification Made in Response to Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Carbon Disulfide.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to data submitted by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical Manufacturer's Association's Carbon Disulfide Task  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Force, EPA is promulgating a treatment standard of 3.8 mg/l based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on data submitted by several facilities which generate high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of carbon disulfide in wastewaters. The proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment standard (0.014 mg/l) was based on one data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point for biological treatment. After receiving substantially  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more treatment data representative of more significant influent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations, EPA is promulgating a carbon disulfide wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of 3.8 mg/l, based on the performance of activated sludge  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at one of the facilities generating carbon disulfide.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1,4-Dioxane.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Eastman Chemical reported that serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical problems, namely wide variation in detection limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> precluded reliable and accurate quantification of 1,4-dioxane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After reviewing detection limit data, EPA decided to withdraw the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment standard for 1,4-dioxane pending technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resolution in a later rule. This decision changes the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment standard for U108 (1,4-dioxane) wastewaters. Formerly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the wastewater treatment standard was 0.12 mg/l; today's rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> promulgates a method of treatment as a standard for U108  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters, namely wet air oxidation or chemical oxidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed by carbon adsorption or incineration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

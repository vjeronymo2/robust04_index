			<p>BFN     [Text] London, 24 May (PL) -- It was reported today in this  capital that Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government, visited Westminster Palace, home of  the British Parliament, and toured the historic building. This  was Alarcon's first event on the official visit he began here  yesterday at the invitation of the British group in the  Parliamentary Union.    Sources close to the visiting mission have reported that Sir  Tom Arnold, a conservative deputy and treasurer of the  British-Cuban group in the House of Commons, one of two houses  in the British Parliament, hosted the leader of the Cuban  legislative branch.    The Cuban delegation received a detailed explanation of the  procedures in the House of Commons and then attended a lunch  hosted by legislator William Rogers, a foreign policy spokesman  for the Labor Party. The Cuban delegation also visited the  famous Tate Gallery, where visitors were able to see valuable  paintings by British artists.    Alarcon also spoke with Sir Michael Marshall, president of  the British Interparliamentary Council, and later he and the  rest of his delegation went to a dinner hosted by John Ward,  president of the British group at the Parliamentary Union.    According to sources of the Cuban Embassy in London, this  first day of activities by the Cuban delegation was a clear  indication of the hosts' satisfaction with the visit, especially  their interest in knowing about the organization and procedures  of the Cuban Parliament.    Alarcon arrived in London on Sunday in the company of Dr.  Osvaldo Martinez, president of the Economic Commission of the  Cuban National Assembly, and Dr. Lidia Tablada, director of the  National Agricultural and Livestock Health Center. The  delegation also includes Dr. Ramon Crespo, secretary general of  the Cuban Health Union, and Juan Alberto Gonzalez, Alarcon's  assistant.    This visit will strengthen relations of friendship and  exchange between the two parliaments and help develop the  already prosperous relations between Havana and London, Cuban  sources said.</p>

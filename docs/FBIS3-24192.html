			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Oleg Zhirnov: "Rossel Persists"] </F>   [Text] The all but buried and long-forgotten plan for  the Ural Republic has risen like a phoenix from the ashes.    Last week former Governor Eduard Rossel, now a senator from  Sverdlovsk Oblast, officially submitted a package of documents  to the Federation Council in an attempt to legalize the Ural  Republic. Copies of the documents were forwarded to the State  Duma. According to plan, the State Duma should pass a law to  change the status of the federation member, and the Federation  Council should ratify it.    Both will require the support of a two-thirds majority.  Eduard Rossel and his fellow countrymen in the Duma have  launched an intense lobbying campaign. The former governor, who  was removed from office by the RF president precisely for his  declaration of the Ural Republic, asserts that he is finding  support in the higher chamber. Furthermore, he is winning the  support of not only senators from krays and oblasts, but also  senators from republics who were previously against this idea.  In the lower house, parliamentary hearings on the Ural  initiative have already been scheduled for 18 April.    On his next trip to Moscow, the ex-governor hopes to talk to  the leaders of political parties and parliamentary factions:  Zhirinovskiy, Zyuganov, and Gaydar. He has special hopes for his  meeting with Vladimir Volfovich, who is "always talking about  the equality of federation members." Sergey Shakhray, the leader  of the PRES and the minister for federation affairs who is  willing to support the idea of a Ural Republic extending to at  least two oblasts, but who objects to a republic confined within  the boundaries of only Sverdlovsk Oblast, was given a copy of  the constitution of the Ural Republic, autographed by Rossel: "A  keepsake, an example of the construction of a strong Russian  state."    "This will be a colossal breakthrough," Eduard Ergartovich  told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA correspondent. "We are the flagship.  If we break through the lines, all oblasts can have the same  status in the future."    In the words of the ex-governor, "after the blow we were  dealt, none of the oblasts is claiming the right to republic  status and its own constitution." The new Russian Basic Law,  however, gave each oblast the right of legislative initiative  and the right to approve its own charter. This started a run on  the Sverdlovsk Oblast legislative drafts. According to Rossel,  all krays and oblasts, without exception, quickly analyzed the  text of the Ural constitution and copied it in their own  charters. There was no need to rack their brains: All they had  to do was preface the text with their own title: "Charter of X  Oblast."    In view of the fact that the new Russian Constitution  proclaimed the equality of federation members, can the  duplication of the Ural constitution in the kray and oblast  charters serve as a practical method of realizing this desired  equality? Can this give new life, "a second wind," to Rossel's  own initiative, which seemed to have been stifled completely by  the president's stern decision?    The Ural constitution does not grant the federation member  the kind of privileges that were granted to Kazan, for example,  in the treaty with Moscow. There is one article, however, which  Rossel calls a "major breakthrough": The declaration that  anything within the boundaries of Sverdlovsk Oblast "belongs to  the Ural Republic." On this basis, local economic laws can be  published and local economic programs can be launched. There  would be no need for the dozens of economic agreements Kazan  concluded with Moscow. Everything would be defined by local  laws. The Ural Republic is being used as a model in several  oblasts, such as Ulyanovsk Oblast, for example, where bicameral  representative bodies of government will be empowered to make  laws.    "We see the Ural Republic as the prototype of the  territorial  division of the Russian Federation," Chairman Vasiliy Tarasenko  of the Senate Committee on Federation Affairs, the Federation  Treaty, and Regional Policy told the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  correspondent after he had read the package of Ural documents.  He warns that they still need careful examination. "If, however,  they do make references to regional or territorial legislation,  I would welcome this. All krays and oblasts need good basic  legislation today."    Rossel has less chance of success in the Duma. The Duma  Committee on Federation Affairs and Regional Policy insists that  the general principles of the federal process must be  consolidated before specific forms of this process can be  regulated. Chairman Vladimir Lysenko of the Subcommittee on the  Development of Federal Relations believes that Rossel's idea is  less relevant now that the new Russian constitution has granted  federation members equal rights. "As soon as this equality was  declared, the other oblasts seem to have calmed down and stopped  making demands. Precedents can be quite dangerous in Russia,  however, and if the Ural Republic wins approval, the others will  begin demanding the same treatment, and this process will be  impossible to stop."    The next "breakthrough" in the federal process could be  accomplished in different ways: either by elevating the status  of a particular RF member or by concluding a separate treaty  with one of them. The "breakthrough" could occur far from the  Urals (Kaliningrad Oblast was the first claimant) and could have  completely different consequences, especially in view of the  fact that Chechnya and Tatarstan--and not the Urals or  Kaliningrad--are still the main source of headaches for central  government officials.</p>

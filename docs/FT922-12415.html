			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / How to Spend It: Sitting pretty LAST TIME I reported on the activities of Julian Chichester and Richard Forwood activities it was to photograph the beautiful antique beds that they were bringing in to the UK from Burma. Supplies of antique Burmese beds having run out the pair have now moved on to Vietnam, where they make some sturdily English-looking garden furniture. They make sure they buy all their teak from plantations where it is replenished as it is used - no primeval forests have been chopped up for this range; Vietnam has been making great attempts at reforestation and in the late 1980s planted some 500m trees on a shoestring budget. The designs are based on 18th and 19th century pattern books and designs by Chippendale, Hepplewhite, Sheraton and JP White (who designed in the Lutyens/Gertrude Jekyll mode). Prices range from Pounds 149 for a dining chair and go up to Pounds 540 for the most complicated bench. The bench photographed right is called The Leighton and sells for Pounds 465. For a free catalogue write to Julian Chichester Designs, 202 Dawes Road, London SW6 7RQ. For an appointment to see the designs in the warehouse ring 071-381-0243.</p>

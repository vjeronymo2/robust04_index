			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / RPI statistics go private The first private-sector contract for the collection of official government statistics was awarded yesterday. Research International, the UK's fourth-largest market research group, has won a five-year contract to collect data for the retail prices index, the Central Statistical Office announced. The collection, processing and validation of about 140,000 prices a month in 180 areas throughout the country was previously performed by the Department of Employment. The CSO will continue to put the data together for government and public use. The CSO said yesterday: 'More rigorous statistical sampling techniques will be used to make the selection of both retail outlets and items more representative of how the public spend their money.' More random regional sampling would be incorporated into the series, along with a broader range of shops, the CSO said. Data collectors would use hand-held computers to collect the data, in place of the traditional clip-boards. If trials prove satisfactory, Research International's first data will be for February next year. Earlier this year the contract for the publication and marketing of government statistics was awarded to the private-sector market research group Taylor Nelson AG.</p>

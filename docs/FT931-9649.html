			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television 'When you read a brilliantly elegant and ironic novel by Jane Austen, do you think of colonial slavery?'. Quite a question. If you don't, then it is time you thought a little more deeply, according to Edward Said. In Arena (BBC 2, 9.30), the ubiquitous Palestinian writer and academic presents the thesis of his recent book about the complex overlap of Europe's culture and imperialism. Robert McBride (C4, 8.00) is an ANC guerrilla who was sentenced to death for bombing a Durban bar and killing three people. He was released last year under the terms of the general amnesty. In this interview he talks about his motives. The irritations of Gardens without Borders (C4, 9.00), are so great that the series comes close to being a wasted opportunity. Who on earth cares that next week the party of Britons touring around gardens in France is going to be joined by an Olympic show jumper? Why not a manufacturer of pork pies? However, tonight's episode does offer a lure in the form of a visit to the garden of Anita Pereire, queen of French gardening.</p>

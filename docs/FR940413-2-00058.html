			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Section 411 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section provided that PCAs and FLBAs sharing substantially the same territory were required to vote on whether to merge. These mergers led to five ACAs with nonexclusive charters in areas where the parties merging did not have identical territories. The FCA Board also provided any association that no longer had exclusive territory as a result of such mergers an opportunity to become an ACA. Several of the associations affected by these ``411 mergers'' subsequently became ACAs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (2) Section 413 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section required a merger vote by the 13 banks for cooperatives (BCs). Eleven of the 13 banks voted to merge, resulting in the creation of three BCs with the same territory.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Section 433 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section authorized certain associations to change their affiliation from one Farm Credit Bank (FCB) to another. The district FCB from which the association shifted retained its chartered authority to continue to serve the area through other existing or newly created associations. However, competitive charters cannot be issued in these areas unless the affected parties give their consent. So far, no competitive association charters have resulted from this provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these statutory authorities, there are certain restraints on the FCA's authority to issue competitive charters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, following passage of the 1987 Act, the FCA Board granted charters to institutions serving the same territory in those situations arising from mergers that were specifically required to be voted on by the 1987 Act or as necessary to provide for a level playing field as a result of those mergers. However, because of concerns surrounding the potential for competitive situations arising from the 1987 Act, the FCA Board determined it would not issue competitive charters, other than as required by statute, until it had thoroughly reviewed the issue.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Second, the law specifies certain circumstances in which the FCA may only grant competitive charters if all of the institutions affected by the proposed charter grant their approval. Those circumstances involve:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The territories where associations changed their affiliation from one FCB to another in accordance with section 433 of the 1987 Act; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The States of Mississippi, Alabama, and all of Louisiana except the territory served by the Northwest Louisiana PCA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of those situations discussed above where an institution must obtain the consent of another institution, the law does not prohibit institutions from requesting ``competitive charters.'' Indeed, the 1971 Act does not directly address the issue of competition among System institutions. Instead, the Act concerns itself with the purposes, operating objectives, and authorities of the System and its regulator. When the agency receives these requests it must act on them, based on an analysis of all relevant facts, and arrive at a reasonable conclusion that is consistent with the purposes of the Act. In the first few years after passage of the 1987 Act, most of the FCA's decisions involving competitive issues were associated with the merger of unlike associations to become ACAs. In the last few years, the competitive issues coming before the FCA have involved banks as well as associations. In addition to matters involving charters, competition issues have arisen in the context of out-of-territory authorities provided for by regulations. By this policy statement, the FCA Board now expresses its views on how the agency will approach decisions that may involve competition among System institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Recent Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1990, the FCA contracted with consultants to review the issue of competition within the System and provide the FCA Board with options to consider. In 1991, as a part of its legislative initiative, the FCA Board recommended to Congress that the 1971 Act be amended to require that ACA charters contain exclusive territory. In 1992, the FCA Chairman appointed FCA Board Member Gary C. Byrne to lead an internal work group focusing on the issue. This work group analyzed competition from several perspectives and developed a set of recommendations for agency action in the absence of legislative changes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

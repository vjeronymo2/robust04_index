			<p>920713 FT  13 JUL 92 / Syndicated Loans: RHM looks set to refinance complex multi-option loan RANKS Hovis McDougall, the food processing group, looks likely to become the latest in a string of UK companies to refinance a complex loan facility arranged in the late 1980s with a simpler, relationship transaction. The company is replacing a Pounds 250m multi-option facility arranged in 1988 with a revolving loan syndicated among a smaller group of relationship banks led by Barclays. The earlier five-year transaction provided RHM with funding at an interest margin just 12.5 basis points over the London interbank offered rate. Last week, banks were tight-lipped about the terms under which the new facility is being offered. Bankers estimate that interest margins have at least doubled - and in some cases trebled - since the late 1980s. However, companies feel they can achieve better terms by dealing with a smaller number of banks. Last year, for example, Grand Metropolitan arranged a Dollars 2.5bn four-year loan to refinance an expiring three-year facility. The number of banks involved in the deal was cut from over 60 to 34. At 37.5 basis points over Libor, the interest margin was considered tight. In 1988, GrandMet paid 25 basis points over Libor for three-year money. However, commitment fees of up to 27.5 basis points made the new facility attractive to potential lenders and the deal was oversubscribed. Elsewhere, Woolwich Building Society increased from Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m its five-year revolving credit facility arranged by JP Morgan. The 11 banks participating in the transaction include Abbey National, the former building society and residential mortgage lender. Abbey National is a rare participant in the syndicated credits market although it is large lender to the building society sector as a buyer of floating-rate and mortgage-backed securities. Yorkshire Building Society is arranging a club loan from a small group of banks led by Fuji Bank. The deal was originally Pounds 50m but is likely to be increased to Pounds 75m this week. Citibank and Banco Santander will lead a syndicate of banks to finance the Dollars 1.25bn acquisition by Cemex, the Mexican cement company, of its Spanish rival Compania Valenciana de Cementos Portland. The initial financing consists of a Dollars 750m guarantee to back the tender offer and a Dollars 800m bridge loan, which will be replaced by longer-dated funding.</p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> A FIRST FOR LOCAL ANESTHETIC  </P> <P> University of Maryland surgeons say they have performed what they believe is  the nation's first gallbladder surgery using only a local anesthetic.  </P> <P> The patient, a 32-year-old opera singer who did not want a general anesthetic  for fear of damage to her vocal cords, had gallbladder surgery recently by an  incision through her navel.  </P> <P> University surgeons have had success with the operation, performing about 100  of the procedures since October, but had never before completed the operation  with only local anesthesia.  </P> <P> Doctors said most patients with problems such as gallstones could have the  surgery in an ambulatory setting and be discharged the same day. Surgeons use a  laparascope, a tube with a tiny lens on one end and a miniature video camera at  the other end, to puncture the abdomen and reach the gallbladder.  </P></p>

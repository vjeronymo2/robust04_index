			<p>910423 FT  23 APR 91 / Observer: Wrong signal There is an awful lot of humbug talked about top executives' pay. Even so the news that Sir Ian MacLaurin, Tesco's retailing superstar, is taking home Pounds 1.5m is bound to raise eyebrows. He is not in the same league as Sir Ralph Halpern, Burton's ex-chief executive, and he has made a lot of money for Tesco shareholders. But the problem with such seemingly massive pay increases today is twofold. They send the wrong sort of signal to a workforce under pressure to squeeze costs. Second, tying management incentive schemes so closely to earnings-per-share growth - perhaps at the expense of balance sheet prudence - can be dangerous. It is time companies spelt out the terms of their executive incentive schemes in the annual report right from the start. Then bonanzas like MacLaurin's would not be such a surprise.</p>

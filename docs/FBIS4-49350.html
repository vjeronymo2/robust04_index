			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report on Anhui CPC Secretary Lu Rongjing's </F> anticorruption speech to the provincial disciplinary inspection  committee meeting on 21 March]    [Text] On the afternoon of 21 March, Lu Rongjing, secretary  of the Anhui provincial CPC committee, delivered an important  speech at the plenary session of the ninth provincial  disciplinary inspection committee. He pointed out that as the  anticorruption struggle is a long-term and arduous task, leaders  at various levels of party committees and governments must take  the overall situation into consideration; correctly handle the  relationship between reform, development, and stability; be  fully aware that economic construction is the central task;  persist in carrying out the policy of promoting the reform and  opening up drive with one hand and cracking down on severe  crimes with the other, equally stressing both; integrate well  the anticorruption struggle with the efforts to deepen reform  measures, to open the province wider to the outside world, to  promote development, and to maintain stability, so that the  anticorruption struggle will be carried out in an in-depth,  lasting, and more effective manner.    At the beginning of the speech, Lu Rongjing gave a positive  appraisal to the results which Anhui has achieved in the earlier  stage of the anticorruption drive. He said last year was a year  in which the province witnessed a rapid progress in reform,  opening up, and in economic construction as well as a year in  which the province achieved great progress in the anticorruption  drive. Particularly since the convening of the plenary session  of the second meeting of the Central Commission for Discipline  Inspection, various levels of discipline inspection committees  in the province, following the unified arrangement made by the  CPC Central Committee and the provincial CPC committee, further  enhanced anticorruption measures; applied greater energy on  anticorruption work with special efforts concentrating on  leading comrades' checking on their own honest performing of  their official duties, on investigating and handling major and  important cases, and on rectifying unhealthy tendencies among  various trades and professions. The drive had been  unprecedented in terms of propaganda drive, scale, and effect.  The province's anticorruption momentum is excellent as a whole  and its development is healthy. The province has scored  results, though in varying degrees, in the three anticorruption  tasks proposed by the CPC Central Committee; blunted the  momentum of the spread of negative and corrupt phenomena;  reduced the number of corruption cases that has long incurred  the wrath of the masses; and further enhanced the enthusiasm and  increased the confidence of the broad mass of cadres and the  masses to take part in the anticorruption struggle.    Lu Rongjing pointed out the need for affirming the results  scored in the earlier stage of the anticorruption drive from a  spirit of seeking truth from facts. However, he cautioned  against making an overestimation of the results. He said all  must be aware of the fact that the province has only achieved  initial anticorruption results and that the province might have  solved some superficial corruption issues in the earlier stage  of the anticorruption drive. However, some hidden and  deep-seated problems have yet to be solved or even left  untouched. Seen from the entire province's situation, the  anticorruption work has also been uneven. Therefore, the  anticorruption struggle's situation is still grim and the task  ahead is still arduous. Leading comrades at various levels of  party committees and governments and comrades at various levels  of discipline inspection and supervision organs must remain  sober- headed; must never become complacent and overly  optimistic because of the initial results in the anticorruption  drive; must not dismiss the existing problems as insignificant;  and must not lower our guard.    Lu Rongjing added: To a great extend, whether the  anticorruption struggle can proceed smoothly and successfully  depends on the awareness of the people, especially the awareness  of leading cadres at all levels. Only when we have a consensus  of view can we have the initiative, the willingness, and the  determination to fight corruption, otherwise we will approach  the problem negatively and passively. The vast number of party  member cadres, especially those in leading positions, must study  the instructions of the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council on fighting corruption and promoting work ethics, as  well as the guidelines laid down by the second and third plenary  sessions of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and  Comrade Jiang Zemin's talks so that we can achieve greater  consensus of view, clear up misunderstandings, do away with  misgivings, and act even more positively, consciously, and  earnestly while launching the anticorruption struggle -- and not  do so negatively, positively, or perfunctorily -- so that we can  seize victories at every stage, promote political and social  stability throughout Anhui, and expedite the healthy development  of reform, opening up, and economic construction.    On what will be done next in fighting corruption, Lu  Rongjing  said: In real life, many phenomena of corruption have generated  from going against the objective of serving the people  wholeheartedly, or from failing to take the interests of the  masses into account. Thus, the guideline for our fight against  corruption is quite clear, namely we must take the masses'  interests into account and consider forging stronger ties with  the masses as an important job in fighting corruption. Leading  cadres at all levels must start by dealing with problems to  which the masses have responded strongly; earnestly deal with  problems in their respective regions, departments, and units;  and deal with major problems themselves. We must set examples  in fighting corruption and promoting work ethics by taking the  lead in carrying out the Central Committee's requirements for  fighting corruption. We must be more aware of the need to take  the masses interests into account, be concerned with the masses  plight, and always bear in mind the masses' problems. Only by  doing so can we have the trust of the people, enable the masses  to see our determination to fight corruption and solve our own  problems, mobilize the masses' initiative, and forge closer ties  between the party and the people.    Lu Rongjing stressed: Whether or not the fight against  corruption can proceed successfully rests primarily with  leadership. Party committees and governments at all levels must  consider the fight against corruption as one of their most  important tasks, one that should be placed high on their agenda.  We must earnestly assume leadership, act personally to deal  with major issues, and mobilize all social quarters to fight  corruption. Each and every party member must take part in the  endeavor, and all party and government organizations must exert  efforts together. Organizations of one level, after dealing  with their own problems, must make sure that the work of  organizations of the next level is properly accomplished. In  addition to following through with the regulations set by the  CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central  Discipline Inspection Commission for fighting corruption and  promoting work ethics, all regions, departments, and units must  proceed from their actual situations and come up with their own  priorities; and then they must take stronger measures, set more  effective rules, and establish more effective operating  mechanisms to make sure that the fight against corruption can  proceed with clear objectives and that there are requirements to  fulfill and measures to take for attaining these objectives.  Leading bodies of party and government organizations must  regard improvement of party conduct and work ethics as well as  fight against corruption as responsibilities to fulfill during  their terms of office. Responsibilities governing leading party  members' conduct and work ethics must be established and  improved, and rules should be set to divide the responsibilities  to make sure that all measures are implemented and all  objectives attained.    Lu Rongjing continued: Under the new situation, the fight  against corruption faces many new situations and new problems.  This being the case, leading cadres at all levels must intensify  their investigation and study so as to find ways to deal with  problems and accumulate the needed experiences for expediting  the fight against corruption. Owing to our imperfect laws and  nonstandardized rules for government conduct and enterprises'  market conduct at a time when the planned economy is being  replaced by a market economy, our enterprises now face many  formidable problems of various descriptions. In particular,  leaders at all levels must intensify their investigation and  study of enterprises, attach importance to resolving their  existing problems, and firmly and strictly punish those who have  seriously violated laws and discipline. If the mistakes made by  persons in charge of enterprises have nothing to do with abusing  authority for personal gains and have not violated the law, we  need not demand them to be perfect, but should protect them and  encourage them to explore and proceed with their reforms bravely  after sincerely pointing out and criticizing their mistakes as  well as helping and educating them so that they can make new  contributions to the development of their enterprises.    Lu Rongjing pointed out: Because of the protracted nature  and formidability of the fight against corruption, we must,  during the fight against corruption, deal with the root causes  and the symptoms and outstanding and routine problems at the  same time. On the one hand, we must firmly punish all corrupt  elements who have abused their authority for personal gains,  bent the law, and accepted and given bribes. By no means should  we be lenient to these elements and by no means should we let  these corrupt elements do whatever they want and remain at  large. On the other hand, while we fight against corruption, we  should make corrections and proceed to build or improve  mechanisms that can effectively restrain the generation and  spreading of the corruption phenomena. To make sure that all  measures for fighting corruption and promoting work ethics are  followed through, we must continue to intensify our efforts in  supervising the performance of leading cadres in examining  themselves, in correcting their own mistakes, and in dealing  with cases about irregularities. We must attach importance to  supporting the operations of specialized organs so that  discipline inspection, procuratorial, and supervisory organs can  give full scope to their important roles in fighting corruption.    Lu Rongjing concluded: Ever since the party Central  Committee issued the order to fight corruption and promote work  ethics, the new outlook in many areas as well as the vivid facts  about censuring corruption have increased the masses' confidence  and enabled them to see a hopeful future. The macroclimate for  fighting corruption and promoting work ethics has now appeared,  specific assignments have been set, and measures have been drawn  up. As long as we make genuine efforts to fight corruption and  follow through with all measures, we certainly can succeed at  various stages in deepening the fight against corruption.    Attending the meeting on the afternoon of 21 March were  leading comrades of the provincial party committee standing  committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee,  and the provincial committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference, as well as various provincial  departments, committees, and bureaus.</p>

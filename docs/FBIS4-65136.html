			<p>BFN     [Text] Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas now says that a  federal solution in Cyprus is not possible because of the  difference in views between the Greek Cypriots and Turkish  Cypriots. Denktas, who is on a private visit to Turkey, called  on the Turkish National Assembly to declare the union between  the occupied areas [northern Cyprus] and Turkey on the same day  the announcement is made that Cyprus has joined the European  Union. Denktas asked the Turkish leadership not to confine  itself to the military occupation, but to support the  pseudostate financially. With financial support, he said, the  pseudostate could become a showcase for Turkey, which will rid  it of the image of an occupation force.    Alternate government spokesman Spiros Arotis stressed  Denktas' inconsistency and recalled that the high level  agreements [of 1977 and 1979] providing for a federal solution  in Cyprus bear his signature. The spokesman said Denktas has  proven in practice that what he seeks and hopes for eventually  is the recognition of his pseudostate.</p>

			<p>930112 FT  12 JAN 93 / Big pension law changes unlikely THE government's pension law review committee is unlikely to recommend sweeping changes that might deter employers from making pension provision, the committee's chairman signalled yesterday. Professor Roy Goode also said he hoped to mitigate the effects of tougher pension regulation by recommending simplification of the many, often conflicting, regulations that govern occupational pensions. 'The consensus expressed across the whole range of respondents to our consultative paper was a desire to see to it that the baby is not thrown out with the bath water,' Prof Goode said in an interview with the Financial Times. Pension scheme members as well as sponsors had expressed that view, he said. The committee was unlikely to recommend, however, that the current regime remains unchanged. As a result of responses to its initial paper, issued last autumn, he added, the committee had expanded its review to include ways to simplify the administrative burden for employers. The pensions industry has long complained about the tax treatment for schemes which contract out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme. The committee is unlikely to take the line urged by employers' groups which would give employers unequivocal use of pension fund surpluses. Prof Goode said the panel might take the view that surpluses belonged neither to employers nor scheme members but served to guarantee payment of promised benefits. The committee is also examining ways to guarantee the enforceability of trust law which currently governs pension fund administration. Thorny questions for pension group, Page 8</p>

			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Finnish bank plans FM1bn equity issue KANSALLIS-Osake-Pankki, Finland's leading commercial bank, is preparing an international share issue worth up to FM1bn (Dollars 173m) as part of plans to raise almost FM3bn in new capital. The bank has already raised FM1.25bn from share and bond issues this year, but says more funds are needed to withstand expected losses in 1993 and 1994. The aim is to have a capital adequacy ratio of around 10 or 11 per cent, well above the 8 per cent international minimum, by 1995, when the bank expects to return to the black. In February it said it was looking to raise FM3bn through share and bond issues to avoid having to call on direct state support. It now wants to launch an additional share issue. Interest from international investors is said to be strong following evidence of improving fortunes in the entire Finnish banking sector. During the past 12 months, KOP's share price has doubled to FM16.50. The aim is to launch the international share issue in the autumn, while making preference capital and perpetual debt issues worth up to FM1.8bn over the next 18 months. The capital note and bond offers, which will primarily be targetted at the US market, will be backed by a state guarantee. KOP's loss before provisions and taxes deepened to FM626m from FM527m in the first four months. However, it still hopes to halve its FM3.7bn 1992 loss over the full year. Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment maker, said yesterday first-half pre-tax profits rose 25 per cent, to SKr495m (Dollars 62.18m) from SKr396m a year earlier. Although sales climbed 42 per cent to SKr4.33bn from SKr3.05bn, the rise would only have been 10 per cent without the effect of acquisitions and the depreciation of the krona. The group said it expected its earnings trend to remain favourable over the rest of the year. Last year's pre-tax income amounted to SKr753m.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONVICTION OF JOHN POINDEXTER  </P> <P> Reading Bruce Fein's "A Verdict With Harm to Spare" (Op-Ed Page, April 9) I  waited for the two standard defenses for the criminal actions of John M.  Poindexter, former national security adviser. That he was only doing it for  patriotic reasons and the security of the United States of America.  </P> <P> What these patriots don't seem to realize is that every time they claim  national security as a reason to cloak unpopular operations from U.S. citizens  (does anyone believe the Soviets had no idea what the CIA was doing) they lose  the trust of the people.  </P> <P> It doesn't seem to bother Fein that the tactics used by Poindexter and his  operatives appear more like those we accuse the Soviets and Cubans of using.  Instead he tries to call the whole thing politically motivated, ignoring the  fact that Ronald Reagan's own attorney general started the investigation into  possible violations of the law.  </P> <P> Instead of admitting that there was no general support in the American public  for a dirty war in Nicaragua, he blames Congress for doing its lawful job, that  of allocating funds and authority to spend those funds. He seems to think that  the executive branch has the right to raise funds on its own authority when  Congress doesn't approve.  </P> <P> EDWARD BRUCE  </P> <P> Spring Valley  </P></p>

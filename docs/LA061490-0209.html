			<p><P> June 14, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MOST OF THE ELDERLY WHO LIVE ALONE IN POVERTY ARE WOMEN  </P> <P> In a tiny apartment in a run-down Philadelphia neighborhood, Daisy Thomas lived  alone. Pictures crowded the walls of her living room, a memorial to a past  life. A copy of the Lord's Prayer hung above the door. Artificial flowers,  faded with age, decorated the coffee table.  </P> <P> A few hundred miles from Daisy's place, down the coast in Columbia, S.C.,  69-year-old Mattie Collins lived in a tired old house on the edge of town. She  moved there after being evicted from her apartment 3 months before. Health  problems, a son-in-law who stole from her and a string of bad luck drove her  into poverty.  </P> <P> Daisy and Mattie represent just two of the 8.3 million older Americans who live  alone. More than 40% live at or near the poverty line. Most of the elderly poor  receive only enough help from social workers and volunteers to survive --  occasional visits from social workers or home health aides, a meal a day from  Meals on Wheels or a few dollars' worth of food stamps.  </P> <P> Elderly women make up 80% of those who live alone. While Social Security and  Medicare have helped to halve the poverty rate among senior citizens over the  past 25 years, millions remain destitute.  </P> <P> Daisy Thomas and Mattie Collins recently gave a visitor a glimpse into this  world.  </P> <P> Daisy's hands shook and her voice wavered as she spoke about growing old and  living alone in a city that she once loved. Her neighborhood, where children  once played in the streets, is now home to drugs, poverty and violence.  </P> <P> "Sure, I'm afraid of being robbed. I got my Social Security check stolen right  out from under me one day," she said, her eyes filled with fear, as if the  incident had just happened. "I had just cashed my check and that boy grabbed  most of it and I never saw him again. Getting old is not for everyone."  </P> <P> After the robbery -- which took place nearly a year ago -- she kept the  dead-bolts on her front door locked tight.  </P> <P> "When you get robbed, that's it. Nobody is there to return it to you. You just  have to get by on what's left."  </P> <P> To her visitor, it seemed hot in her cramped living room, but to Daisy, it  still felt cold. Her eyes wandered nervously around the room, reflecting the  discomfort she felt having someone there. She didn't want people to know how  poor she really was.  </P> <P> "I hate to ask people for money, but if you get hungry enough, you'll ask," she  said.  </P> <P> Two days after that conversation, Daisy died, alone in her final moments just  as she had been in the final years of her life.  </P> <P> Daisy, who suffered from diabetes, high blood pressure and chronic heart  failure, survived on a Social Security check and some food stamps. Not much was  left after she paid her rent and utility bills.  </P> <P> And she received little outside help. Underfinanced and short-staffed, the  nearby office on aging could only afford to send someone by once every 8 weeks  to tell her she was still on the waiting list for a home-care program.  </P> <P> In a deteriorating neighborhood in Columbia, Mattie slowly ate the meal  delivered once a day by the local office on aging, pretending not to notice the  cockroaches crawling on her TV tray and couch.  </P> <P> "I don't want to sound like a preacher," she said quietly, "but people  shouldn't be treated like this. You work hard all your life and then you get to  the point where you can't do it anymore."  </P> <P> From a wheelchair in her cold, empty living room, she told of being evicted by  her last landlord without even a chance to move her belongings.  </P> <P> "They threw away all of my things," she said. "My baby pictures, clothes,  washing machine. Everything went out on the trash pile. What wasn't stolen got  ruined in the rain."  </P> <P> Worse, the grandson that she loved and cared for was recently taken away by the  social services department. Just barely able to take care of herself, she could  not take care of the child. Noting that her daughter was too poor to care for  him herself, Mattie said, "That boy has been my life."  </P> <P> Mattie has been hit hard with health problems in recent years. Two strokes,  four heart attacks, arthritis, kidney disease and respiratory problems have  left her nearly helpless. Dentures are not covered by Medicare, so she does  without.  </P> <P> Her sole support comes from a monthly Social Security check and food stamps.  With that, she manages to give some money to her daughter, who lives nearby. A  social worker stops by occasionally to update her file.  </P> <P> Asked how she gets by, Mattie smiled and said, "It takes a lot of strength."  </P></p>

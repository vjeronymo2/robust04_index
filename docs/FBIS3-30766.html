			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lord David Owen, cochairman of the </F> conference on former Yugoslavia, by Zoran Jevdjovic after talks  with Serbian President Milosevic in Belgrade on 7 February; in  English with superimposed translation into Serbo-Croatian --  recorded]    [Text] [Owen] We really must be very quick because I must  arrive in Brussels to attend the meeting of the European Union  foreign ministers.    We had very useful and important talks with the president  [Milosevic]. We discussed regional issues, as well as the issue  of peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the ways to avoid tragedies  like the one that occurred in Sarajevo.    [Jevdjovic] It has been reported that Butrus-Ghali had  sought authorization for the use of air strikes. Are we any  closer to these air strikes now?    [Owen] I hope that through the negotiations we will be able  to avoid tragedies like the one that had happened in Sarajevo.  Last night in Zvornik, Mr. Stoltenberg and I received Dr.  Karadzic's consent that he would negotiate with the UN  administration on the demilitarization of Sarajevo. Therefore,  we can make progress. Mr. Akashi and the UN generals will try  to find an agreement on military steps that are necessary to  ensure a true cease-fire and demilitarization in phases. We are  negotiating, and we hope that this can be accomplished.    Only an idiot wants the air strikes. On the other hand, only  idiots can further tolerate the situation in which many people  are losing their lives, as in Sarajevo on Saturday. This is a  question of a sensible solution. The way I understood the  letter from the UN secretary general, he is seeking the  authorization of the NATO Council. Let us recall that NATO is  supposed to follow UN policy. The United Nations does not want  to be a warring side but wants to remain objective. However, it  must protect the UN Protection Force [UNPROFOR] and the UNPROFOR  mandate. Namely, UNPROFOR has a mandate in relations to  Sarajevo, which is to stop the shelling of Sarajevo and the  infantry attacks and clashes on the lines of contact.    The Bosnian Government Army and the army of the Bosnian  Serbs  should sign an agreement that would deal with both problems, the  situation regarding the infantry, the situation on the field,  and the situation regarding heavy arms around Sarajevo.    [Jevdjovic] Did Mr. Karadzic agree to the project of  Sarajevo's demilitarization?    [Owen] Yes, he is willing to negotiate with the UN  administration. We hope that this will be discussed in detail  with the United Nations on a daily basis. This should have  happened yesterday. It could appear on the agenda of the  meeting dedicated to the measures of trust, which is scheduled  to take place in Geneva on Thursday [10 February]. The Thursday  meeting in Geneva is not a meeting on a global peace solution.  If something like this happens and it is discussed, then fine,  but it is a meeting dedicated to the measures of trust.</p>

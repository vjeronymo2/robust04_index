The letter reads:    "We wish to thank you for the great appreciation of the  efforts Russia is making to alleviate the humanitarian situation  in the FRY. I understand the difficulties that the people of  your country are experiencing. We believe that an urgent  political solution and the reaching of an acceptable  comprehensive agreement between the three sides in  Bosnia-Herzegovina will bring about the lifting of sanctions  against Yugoslavia.    ``The Russian side made energetic efforts during 1993 to try  to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the FRY, primarily in terms  of supplying it with energy. Unfortunately, our repeated  appeals to the UN Security Council sanctions committee,  including the latest one of 10 December 1993, have so far not  met with the necessary understanding. However, Russia intends  to continue to insist on obtaining permits that would enable it  to satisfy the humanitarian needs of the FRY. In so doing, the  recommendations by the president of the UN Security Council  sanctions committee, of which we have informed you through the  Russian Embassy in Belgrade, will be taken into consideration.    "For our part, we confirm our readiness to begin  humanitarian  deliveries of gas once the necessary permit has been obtained."</p>

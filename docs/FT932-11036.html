			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Technology: Boost for epilepsy market Wellcome, the UK drugs group, this week stressed the importance of its epilepsy treatment, Lamictal, the first new medicine for the disease in 10 years. The company believes it could significantly expand the Pounds 750m-a-year epilepsy market, which, according to Lehman Brothers, the US brokers, is growing at about 20 per cent a year. Trevor Jones, research and development director, said the drug was a truly outstanding advance in the treatment of epilepsy. Trials suggested that more than half of patients adding Lamictal to their existing medication experienced a 50 per cent reduction in seizures. In 56 per cent of these patients, they were able to stop taking their original anti-epileptic. Jones said those suffering from an 'absence' effect associated with certain types of epilepsy experienced a fall in momentary losses of concentration when using Lamictal. From a base-line of 140 incidents a month, events fell to less than 20. In addition, the duration of events dropped from about 450 seconds to less than 50 seconds. The clinical trials also suggested the drug improved quality of life and overall well-being. Lamictal had a low incidence of central nervous systems side effects, claimed Jones. The existing therapies such as Ciba-Geigy's Tegretol, Abbott and Sanofi's Depakote and Epilim, and Warner-Lambert's Dilantin, have problems with gastrointestinal side-effects. Jones hoped the drug, presently licensed in 10 countries, would be approved imminently in Germany, Italy, Spain and the US. In the UK, where it was launched, it already has 13.5 per cent of the market. Wellcome hopes to submit a new drug application for Lamictal to be used on its own either next year or in 1995. A dossier for paediatric use should be deposited over the next two years. The company is also looking at using Lamictal and a more potent successor compound called 524C79 for the treatment of acute and chronic pain.</p>

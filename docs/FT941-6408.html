			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / MPs call for survey of civil service morale A committee of MPs has called on the government to ask civil servants to see if changes in the civil service have damaged morale or weakened the public-service ethos. The Treasury and civil service committee has asked the Cabinet Office to conduct the survey as part of its probe of the role of the civil service. Mr William Waldegrave, the public service minister, is believed to be sympathetic to the idea. In the light of evidence in the arms-for-Iraq inquiry the committee is considering whether a statutory code of ethics is needed to protect civil servants who are asked by ministers to behave unethically or mislead parliament. The First Division Association, the union for top civil servants, yesterday presented a draft code of ethics to the committee. The association called for an independent appeal body for civil servants faced with ethical dilemmas. The new civil service ethics tribunal would be able to examine such dilemmas confidentially. Consisting of three privy councillors, senior politicians drawn from across the political spectrum, it would also have the power to force instructions to be withdrawn if they were ruled unethical. Ms Elizabeth Symons, the association's general secretary, told the committee that the code should defend three fundamental principles: The accountability of civil servants to parliament - in most cases through ministers. The impartiality and political neutrality of the civil service. The appointment of civil servants through free and open competition rather than political patronage. Ms Symons said the arms-for-Iraq inquiry had revealed confusion over the relationship between ministers, civil servants and parliament. She said: 'The code would inform ministers, civil servants, members of parliament and the public about what that relationship should be.' At present civil servants have a duty to report financial irregularities to their superiors, she said. A similar duty should be imposed for unethical instructions.</p>

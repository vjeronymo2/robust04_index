			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-REPORTER TELLS OF RADICAL IDEAS;  </P> <P> A 'CLOSET SOCIALIST' STIRS FUROR OVER NEWS STORIES  </P> <P> In December, 1971, having told his editor at the Wall Street Journal that he  was leaving the paper after a decade as a reporter there, A. Kent MacDougall  sent this message to all Journal bureaus over the newspaper's internal wire  network:  </P> <P> "On January 7, after ten years and three months of . . . peonage, I will be  free at last, free at last, great gawd almighty, free at last. . . . "  </P> <P> Journal editors were furious with MacDougall over that message, but they're  even angrier at him now for writing another, much longer and more controversial  message, this one published in a small socialist magazine.  </P> <P> In a two-part article for Monthly Review, MacDougall, 57 -- who also worked for  the Los Angeles Times for 10 years and is now on sabbatical from his job as a  professor of journalism at UC Berkeley -- says he has long been a "closet  socialist" who used the news pages of "the bourgeois press" to "popularize  radical ideas."  </P> <P> He also says he wrote more than 30 "major articles" under different pseudonyms  for various radical publications while at the Passaic, N.J., Herald-News and  during his first six months at the Journal.  </P> <P> MacDougall's 9,000-word Monthly Review story has sparked a contretemps in the  mainstream journalistic community -- which prides itself on not letting  ideology color its news coverage -- and has been seized upon by some  conservatives as proof that the press has a liberal bias.  </P> <P> Journal officials were so upset by MacDougall's comments that they issued a  statement saying they were "offended and outraged," and editors at both the  Journal and The Times said MacDougall greatly "exaggerated" and "romanticized"  his attempts to subvert their publications.  </P> <P> MacDougall's former editors say his stories for The Times and the Journal met  both papers' professional standards of accuracy and fairness. Their judgment is  largely confirmed by a careful, independent reading of all the stories  MacDougall cited in Monthly Review.  </P> <P> MacDougall himself now concedes that "99% of what I wrote (for the Journal and  The Times) had absolutely no ideological content at all." When he did write  stories in which ideology could have played a role, MacDougall now says, he  wrote them according to proper journalistic standards.  </P> <P> "I regret that the somewhat brash language and the tone of the opening of the  piece was misconstrued as my bragging about having been a media mole with a  secret mission to push Marxist propaganda past my editors, on to unsuspecting  readers," he said. "That was in no way my intent."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Viewed as Proof  </P> <P> But conservatives who have long complained that "news presentation by the media  elite is heavily biased in favor of liberal views and attitudes," as William  Rusher, former publisher of National Review, argued in a book last year, have  welcomed MacDougall's Monthly Review article as proof of their charges.  </P> <P> "With MacDougall's revelations, it will be harder . . . to dismiss evidence of  news bias at the Journal and other publications," Cliff Kincaid, director of  media analysis for Accuracy in Media, wrote in the Dec. 24 issue of Human  Events.  </P> <P> Accuracy in Media is a conservative watchdog of the media, and Human Events --  like National Review -- is a conservative magazine. Monthly Review (circulation  7,000) bills itself as "an independent socialist magazine." MacDougall -- who  says in the Monthly Review that "Karl Marx (may be) my all-time favorite  journalist" -- is clearly upset that he has given journalistic aid and  political comfort to those he perceives as the enemy.  </P> <P> He regrets, he said in an interview, that he has embarrassed his Journal and  Times editors and that he has "provided some ammunition to humorless right-wing  media monitors to try to make the case that the Establishment press is allowing  left-leaning reporters to run off on anti-Establishment tirades."  </P> <P> MacDougall worked for the Journal from 1961 to 1972 -- spending much of his  time writing about the press. He was a business reporter for The Times from  1977 to 1987. Before that, he worked for five years at the Passaic Herald-News.  </P> <P> Gaining academic tenure gave him "the luxury of coming out of the ideological  closet at last," MacDougall said, but he insisted that his Monthly Review story  (titled "Boring From Within the Bourgeois Press") had been "misconstrued." He  said he had been "a journalist first and a radical second throughout my career.  . . . I stuck to accepted standards of newsworthiness, accuracy and fairness  (in my stories)."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adhered to Standards  </P> <P> Editors at both The Times and the Journal were quick to agree that MacDougall  had, indeed, adhered to their professional standards.  </P> <P> "We have reviewed articles he wrote while at the Journal and we believe our  editing process succeeded in making sure that what appeared in print under his  byline met Journal standards of accuracy, newsworthiness and fairness," the  Journal said in its official statement.  </P> <P> Michael Gartner, who edited and rewrote many of MacDougall's articles for the  Journal, said: "I always assumed his politics were quite liberal, but I don't  think it affected his reporting one bit.  </P> <P> "I judge journalists by one thing -- whether they are fair, thorough and  accurate," said Gartner, former Page 1 editor of the Journal and now president  of NBC News. By those standards, Gartner said, MacDougall was an "A+ reporter .  . . an outstanding reporter."  </P> <P> MacDougall's editors at The Times offered similar appraisals and assurances.  </P> <P> "Anybody who talked to him knew he was on the left side of the spectrum," said  William F. Thomas, editor of The Times from 1971 until retiring Jan. 1.  "Nevertheless, he met every journalistic standard. . . . He was a  professional."  </P> <P> MacDougall, who won several journalism awards and whose work was several times  entered for a Pulitzer Prize, writes in the Monthly Review that "reconciling  radicalism and reporting for the mass media came naturally" to him as the son  of Curtis D. MacDougall, a journalist and political activist who ran as the  Progressive Party candidate for U.S. senator from Illinois in 1948. The elder  MacDougall was also a longtime professor of journalism at Northwestern  University, where he taught Thomas, among many others.  </P> <P> Thomas lived with the MacDougall family for six months as an undergraduate but  he said he didn't realize that Kent MacDougall was his former professor's son  until after MacDougall came to work at The Times. He was hired at Thomas'  urging because Thomas had been impressed with his "remarkably sensible and  professional voice" in stories for the Journal and elsewhere.  </P> <P> Thomas said MacDougall is now "romanticizing his role . . . hallucinating a  little bit" about having tricked his editors into publishing Marxist  propaganda.  </P> <P> Paul Steiger, deputy managing editor of the Journal and former business editor  of The Times, said MacDougall is "much more a secret agent in his own mind than  he was in reality.  </P> <P> "It's wrong for someone . . . in our profession (to) have as a motive the  intent to subvert the process," Steiger said, "but if you look at what appeared  (under MacDougall's byline) in either paper, for the most part, it was pretty  straightforward journalism."  </P> <P> MacDougall said he "deeply respects" The Times and the Journal and wrote his  Monthly Review stories in part "to disabuse radicals of the notion that press  lords get together in some hotel room and conspire to keep information  embarrassing to the Establishment out of the Establishment press.  </P> <P> "I wanted to demonstrate that a good reporter, who got his facts right and who  worked for good papers, could get . . . a lot more stuff into print than  radicals would suppose," he said.  </P> <P> MacDougall now says that in his "over-exuberance at bursting out of the  ideological closet" and "to grab the attention of radicals who didn't know who  I was . . . I got kind of carried away," using an unintentionally "boastful . .  . tone" and some "infelicitously worded" phrases.  </P> <P> He says he realizes he was "naive" to have thought his stories in the Monthly  Review would be read only by "old lefties."  </P> <P> In the Monthly Review, MacDougall wrote that as a reporter for The Times and  the Journal, he had:  </P> <P>  -- "Helped popularize radical ideas with lengthy, sympathetic profiles of  Marxist economists.  </P> <P>  -- "Exposed the simplistic, jingoistic editorial policies of such leading  retrogressive periodicals as the New York Daily News, Time magazine and the  Reader's Digest."  </P> <P>  -- "Made sure to seek out experts whose opinions I knew in advance would  support my thesis."  </P> <P>  -- "Sought out mainstream authorities to confer recognition and respectability  on radical views I sought to popularize."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Called 'Bizarre'  </P> <P> In its statement, the Journal said it was "bizarre and troubling that any man  who brags of having sought to push a personal political agenda on unsuspecting  editors and readers should be teaching journalism at a respected university."  </P> <P> But Tom Goldstein, dean of the graduate school of journalism at UC Berkeley and  himself a former reporter for the Wall Street Journal, praised MacDougall as a  "fine reporter" and a "splendid teacher."  </P> <P> "We have no ideological litmus test at this school," Goldstein said. "Kent  MacDougall's personal beliefs are his, not ours, and he scrupulously keeps  ideology out of the classroom." MacDougall also insisted he doesn't proselytize  his students.  </P> <P> Interviews with a half-dozen students who have taken classes from MacDougall at  UC Berkeley tended to confirm this. All praised him as a good, demanding  teacher and "tough editor," and most said his ideology, though apparent, wasn't  forced on them and did not appear to intrude on his teaching.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Strong Opinions'  </P> <P> One student, Brian Doherty, said: "It's clear that he had strong opinions about  certain things in society, but he never tried to drill into our minds that this  was . . . the only way to look at things. He was always a great promoter of  diversity in thought."  </P> <P> Editors for whom MacDougall worked at The Times and the Journal also invoked  the word "diversity" in explaining his value to their newspapers. A newspaper  is supposed to be a marketplace of competing and conflicting ideas, they said,  and the more diversity a newspaper staff has, the better it can serve a diverse  society.  </P> <P> Frederick Taylor, managing editor of the Journal during MacDougall's last two  years there, said he was "delighted" to publish MacDougall's stories on radical  economists and historians because they were stories that "Journal readers  certainly ought to see and know about."  </P> <P> MacDougall undoubtedly chose to write about some subjects and not others  because of his socialist views, but other, more conservative reporters chose  other, more conservative subjects for similar reasons, his editors said. As  long as all stories pass the same standards of accuracy, fairness and reader  interest, the editors said, the public benefits.  </P> <P> Thus, while MacDougall wrote a profile of journalist I. F. Stone on the left,  other reporters have profiled George Will and William F. Buckley on the right.  </P> <P> Moreover, editors -- not reporters -- put stories in the newspaper, and at the  Wall Street Journal, in particular, stories are heavily edited. When MacDougall  was at the Journal, most Page 1 stories -- including many of MacDougall's --  were thoroughly rewritten by a special Page 1 staff, and editors say that any  bias would have been eliminated in this process.  </P> <P> MacDougall has always been a much better reporter than writer, and even he  admits that one major problem with his Monthly Review article was that "no one  edited it."  </P> <P> When MacDougall was at The Times, his editor was generally John Lawrence, then  the paper's assistant managing editor for economic affairs and now a  contributing editor at Fortune magazine. Lawrence says he knew of MacDougall's  political views and "looked at his stories accordingly."  </P> <P> Lawrence says he wouldn't have permitted MacDougall to write about a Marxist  economist "if I'd known that he was . . . as strong a proponent . . . as he now  claims to have been," but Lawrence also says ideological bias "was not a major  problem" in MacDougall's stories. When "hints of bias" did appear, he says,  they were "edited out."  </P> <P> </P> <P> More Balanced Stories  </P> <P> In fact, in the Monthly Review, MacDougall cited several examples of Times  editors eliminating ideologically loaded phrases from his stories, and he also  cited instances in which Times editors forced him to present a more balanced  story than he had originally written.  </P> <P> When he wrote a series for The Times in 1984 on the widening gap between the  rich and the poor, MacDougall said in the Monthly Review, he had a "difficult"  time with his editor. He was told to eliminate and change many passages and  even after he had "balanced and sanitized the . . . series to what I thought  would be my editor's satisfaction, he still found passages not fit for print."  </P> <P> In his Monthly Review account of the occasional stories on radical subjects  that he wrote for the Journal and The Times, MacDougall neglected to point out  that even those stories were not propagandistic.  </P> <P> Although MacDougall boasted in Monthly Review of having "introduced Journal  readers to the ideas of . . . the left-wing journalist I. F. Stone," he didn't  point out that his story on Stone also said that some "respected people" in  Washington, liberals and conservatives, said Stone is "simply wrong on most  counts," that he has no impact and that he is the victim of a "manic obsession  against the use of power. . . . "  </P> <P> MacDougall has written a shorter version of his Monthly Review story for a  forthcoming issue of the Columbia Journalism Review, and in that version, he  says, "some of the flamboyant language (of the original) is toned down," and "I  make it clear that I didn't try to get propaganda past my editors."  </P> <P> But MacDougall does not recant either his radical views or his conviction that  being a radical, "rather than interfering with the professional performance of  my job . . . actually helped make me a better reporter."  </P> <P> MacDougall says he has never been a member of any radical, socialist or  communist organization and that his "radical perspective" made him a "true  outsider and a skeptic," a reporter able and willing to "question who benefits  from any government policy (or) practice . . . who controls things."  </P> <P> "I think capitalist newspapers could do themselves -- and capitalism -- a favor  by actively recruiting radical reporters and putting them to work examining the  structural causes of poverty, racism, sexism, environmental degradation and  other ills," he wrote in the Monthly Review.  </P> <P> MacDougall's radical political views probably wouldn't arouse much controversy  were he a journalist or a professor in Europe or in several other areas of the  world where there is a long and legitimate tradition of intellectual Marxist  criticism and where even the mainstream press is more ideological. But most of  the mainstream American press, at least for the past generation or so, have  prided themselves on being non-ideological, and the political spectrum in this  country has always been far narrower than in many other countries.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Arouses Suspicion  </P> <P> The Left, as it is known in Europe and elsewhere, barely exists in the United  States, and since the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s in particular,  anything that even smacks of Marxism arouses suspicion and hostility in many  quarters here.  </P> <P> Although MacDougall's editors at The Times and the Journal scoff at his claims  to have subverted their publications, they are less sanguine about his having  written pseudonymously for socialist and radical publications while working for  the Journal.  </P> <P> "That's dishonest as hell, terribly unethical," says Taylor, the former Journal  managing editor.  </P> <P> Taylor, who retired from the Journal in 1986 and now publishes a monthly  newspaper in Oregon, says that if he had known about the pseudonymous articles  at the time, MacDougall would have been fired.  </P> <P> Ironically, MacDougall writes in his Monthly Review series, he stopped writing  for leftist publications within six months of joining the Journal, because he  did not have time to do the "original reporting" for them that he deemed  necessary once he had "internalized the standards and methodology of the most  meticulous member of the capitalist press."  </P> <P> Having been exposed to the Journal's "fastidiousness about facts," MacDougall  wrote, he was no longer willing to "do less than my best possible work for the  socialist press."  </P> <P> Taylor, among others, seemed amused by that admission.  </P> <P> "You could make an argument -- I won't make it -- but you could make an  argument that the Journal made an honest man of him," Taylor said.  </P></p>

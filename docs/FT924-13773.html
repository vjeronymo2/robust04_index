			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / Philippines to start IMF talks next month THE Philippines expects to start negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) next month on a medium-term financing programme to support the new government's economic development plan, writes Jose Galang in Manila. Mr Ramon del Rosario, the finance secretary, said yesterday the proposed three-year financing plan would replace the current 18-month standby arrangement that expires next March. Without disclosing the amount to be sought, Mr del Rosario said the new programme would be 'growth oriented', as opposed to the austerity and stabilisation themes of the series of short-term standby arrangements that Manila had concluded with the IMF since the local financial crisis in 1983. The IMF's extended fund facility (EFF) will be tapped for the new programme. According to other monetary officials, the Philippines may seek up to Dollars 1bn (Pounds 587m) for its 'growth-oriented' economic scheme. Funds releases for the final stage of the present standby facility were approved late last week by the IMF executive board in Washington, after a favourable report on Philippine economic performance.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Roberto Orozco R.] </F>   [Text] Quilali -- The demobilization of the last 3-80  Northern Front [FN 3-80] contingent in Quilali yesterday marked  the beginning of the most difficult phase of the northern  region's peace process. All sectors agreed, however, that this  phase is part of the fulfillment of the peace agreement.    Sergio Caramagna, director of the OAS International  Commission of Support and Verification [CIAV-OAS], spoke to LA  PRENSA about specific points of the agreement and said that  "this is where the hard part begins."    The Catholic Church, leaders of the FN 3-80, and even the  government agree with that assessment. Government Minister  Alfredo Mendieta addressed the FN 3-80 troops and said that "if  it was hard to achieve peace, it will be even harder to maintain  it."    Some 300 FN 3-80 fighters surrendered their weapons to the  government at 1700 at the city's baseball stadium, located about  287 km northeast of Managua, in an effort to end the conflict  that has killed no less than 600 people.    The main points of the agreement between the government and  the FN 3-80, which is now entering politics, call for security,  land, and financial aid to begin production. They also call for  the creation of a development region where the government has  agreed to make specific investments.    According to Byron Alegria, deputy chief of the Nicaraguan  Agrarian Reform Institute, the government has kept its part of  the land bargain.    "We have granted all kinds of facilities for the demobilized  rebels to acquire lands that were mortgaged to government  banks," Byron explained. He added that "there are about 4,000  manzanas that can be used for cattle ranching or for growing  coffee and grain."    Land has already been selected for coffee production, and  according to Alegria, some 300 people will begin work tomorrow.  The farm will have its own electricity plant and three  separator machines. Another 100 people will join the work in  May, and there will be work for about 800 people during the  harvest.    Next Monday the Education Ministry will appoint 22 teachers  to work at the new schools in Quilali and nearby towns, a  measure that is also part of the peace agreements.    About 600 demobilized FN 3-80 fighters are expected. Some  100 rebels surrendered their weapons during the first phase of  the disarmament process on 2 March.    Another 150 rebels surrendered their weapons on 8 April  during the second disarmament phase, and on 15 April, El Chacal  and another 300 militants finally ended the FN 3-80  demobilization process. Only 50 militants remain armed to  provide security for the demobilized rebels.    The government has concluded the police instruction program  offered to 74 FN 3-80 members at the Police Academy. These  future policemen eventually will be responsible for providing  security for the demobilized rebels.    The Sandinist People's Army reportedly will withdraw its  soldiers from Quilali. Several trucks reportedly arrived in  Quilali to remove the soldiers of the First Northern Military  Command, which operated in that area.    El Chacal surrendered two Redeye missiles and a Sam-7  missile  to the government at the demobilization ceremony.    Two U.S. Embassy officials who attended the disarmament  ceremony asked for the immediate destruction of the missiles,  but the Special Disarmament Brigade was not prepared to blow  them up.    The FN 3-80 weapons were destroyed in a hole dug for that  purpose.</p>

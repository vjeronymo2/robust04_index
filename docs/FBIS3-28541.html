The weight of the North Korean nuclear problem was felt  again  in recent weeks as the escalating tension prompted the Foreign  Ministry to hastily announce that Han is pushing up his Canada,  U.S. and Mexico tour schedule. Instead of leaving on Sunday  for Canada, he takes off on Wednesday first for Washington for a  two-day visit.    The announcement came amid a spreading mood of resignation  here that patience has hit the wall in trying to talk out the  nuclear problem with North Korea.    Han will likely discuss sanctions against North Korea in his  talks with U.N. Secretary-general Butrus Butrus-Ghali and top  U.S. policy-makers.    Seoul first proposed the itinerary change to squeeze in the  two extra days.    "Day-to-day developments are critical at the moment," said  Chang Chai-ryong, director-general of American affairs, in  explaining the reason for the change.    The trip takes Han to meetings with the White House national  security team including top Advisor Anthony Lake, foreign  policy-makers including Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and military officials such as Defense Secretary William Perry.    The talks fall at a delicate time. When Han was planning the  Washington trip last month, he was thinking about how the two  countries should prepare for the next round of high-level North  Korea-U.S. talks that would have dealt with symbolic  improvement of relations.    Instead, North Korea is now threatening to break off  negotiations with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  on nuclear inspections. American Congressmen are calling for  action, not dialogue, to resolve the problem. Press reports  focus on possible military scenarios in case of war on the  Korean peninsula.    Han will be in or near the United States as the nuclear  problem reaches the Feb. 21 "deadline," the day the IAEA Board  of Governors opens its meeting.    This week's Washington visit is a dip in the water,  discussing various scenarios from sanctions to a shift whenever  necessary. But Han, while talking about sanctions, will still  pin his hopes on a last-minute backdown by Pyongyang and urge  diplomatic dialogue to that end.    Seoul, after all, is the last party wishing to see a clash  with Pyongyang.    The following week is when the two countries take the  plunge,  having to decide whether to really impose sanctions. Once the  IAEA decides that its nuclear safeguards activities in North  Korea are irreparably compromised, the Security Council will  take over and naturally move on to U.N. sanctions.    The time in between will be spent on mustering the support  of  China, the North's staunchest ally, and Japan whose severance of  secretive money flowing into Pyongyang is critical in case of  economic sanctions.    Han's decision to spend more time with U.S. officials  reflects Seoul's feeling that it's time to establish concrete  plans. South Korea and the United States will have to determine  when to turn these plans into action.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with SPD Federal Manager Guenter Verheugen by </F> Ulrich Rosenbaum in Bonn; date not given: "This Was an  Artificial Good Mood"]    [Text] [Rosenbaum] How do you assess the course of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU] congress?    [Verheugen] The CDU has provided another piece of evidence  of its helplessness. It analyzes and criticizes matters, but it  does not take the appropriate steps and, furthermore, it keeps  silent about the fact that it is responsible for these matters.  The people know very well who has ruled in Bonn for the past 11  years.    [Rosenbaum] However, there is no doubt that Helmut Kohl was  able to convey the mood for a new start....    [Verheugen] This was an artificial good mood and nothing  else but auto-suggestion. This party congress will not have any  long-term effect.    [Rosenbaum] Are you underestimating Kohl's qualities as a  fighter?    [Verheugen] We have known from the very start that he can  and will fight. However, over the next few months the problems  will catch up with him. Unemployment will rise. And the debts  are assuming uncontrollable dimensions. Kohl's room for  maneuver is increasingly narrowing. Therefore, it is no wonder  that he tries to escape into topics of yesterday and the day  before yesterday.    [Rosenbaum] How do you assess the CDU's basic program?    [Verheugen] We will analyze it with the appropriate  attention. In general, I consider it a step backwards, because  it does not look to the future but is just the imitation of  failed government policy. I would called it moderate  Thatcherism. And when I see how the working people have been  pushed back, I am seriously worried about the CDU's character as  a people's party.    [Rosenbaum] Are you overlooking that new statements -- for  example, on the ecological market economy -- are indeed looking  to the future?    [Verheugen] I would like to believe it, if one could hope  that this will have any effects on practical policy. We will  not spare the CDU this test. Government policy so far has  contradicted that.    [Rosenbaum] The idea of family-splitting does not seem to be  far away from the ideas of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] to change spouses' splitting [for taxation  purposes].    [Verheugen] The SPD has repeatedly called for a fair  equalization of families' burdens. It must be recognized that  now the CDU, too, thinks that something has to be done in this  respect. We want the abolition of tax allowances for children  and a limitation of the advantages derived from splitting.  Instead, child allowance should be paid for each child; we are  thinking in terms of about 250 German marks. At the moment we  are working on a procedure that could save a lot of  administrative work: Child allowance would be directly deducted  from payable tax. Nontax payers or those who pay very little  tax would get the sum directly.</p>

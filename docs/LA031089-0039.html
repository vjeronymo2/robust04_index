			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> AT CSUN, THE VERY MODEL OF A MAN OF GENIUS -- DA VINCI  </P> <P> The inventions sketched by Leonardo da Vinci in more than 8,000 pages of  personal notes testify to the brilliance of the 15th-Century painter, who  envisioned such possibilities as helicopters, automobiles, hydraulics and  robots.  </P> <P> But wind up, crank, push or pump one of the working models that go on exhibit  Monday at Cal State Northridge and the true genius of the Renaissance man comes  to life.  </P> <P> "At first you see them as inert, immobile objects," said Donald Strong, a  professor of art history at CSUN. "But when his machines are working, they are,  in fact, living machines."  </P> <P> Twenty-four replicas of the devices, including a paddle-wheel ship, odometer,  drill press, pile driver and parachute, will be at CSUN's Fine Arts Gallery  through April 14. The models, on loan from a collection begun in 1951 by IBM,  are all "hands-on" exhibits, made from wood and brass, standing several feet  tall.  </P> <P> Grab the crank of a scaling ladder and spin the large, toothed gear until all  the sections are extended. Da Vinci was thinking in terms of scaling the wall  of an enemy fortress, but the device clearly predates modern firefighting  equipment.  </P> <P> Turn the handle on one of his many gear systems -- machines more theoretical  than practical in his day -- and see how da Vinci used several cogs to simulate  what today might be called a variable-speed transmission.  </P> <P> And don't forget to spin the wheels on the military tank, an armored capsule  intended for carrying heavy firepower and to be driven from within by men with  cranks.  </P> <P> "This is all movement with a purpose," said Strong, who will lecture about the  devices at 10 a.m. March 27 in the Fine Arts Gallery. "He believed he had the  power to design something that had a living presence because it obeyed the same  laws of operation as anything created by nature itself. In Leonardo's mind, man  created on a par with nature."  </P> <P> Of course, da Vinci was not the only man of his day weighing the heady ideas  that made the 15th Century one of the most colorful, vital periods in history.  But what made da Vinci unique, say scholars, was his extraordinary gift for  synthesis, visualizing the relationships between art, medicine, music,  engineering and the forces of nature.  </P> <P> Born in 1452 near Florence, Italy, da Vinci was the illegitimate son of a  notary and, as such, was not permitted to attend the local university. Instead,  he studied painting and gained the artistic perspective that allowed him to  record with such precision the wonders of the world he lived in.  </P> <P> He dissected corpses to learn human anatomy, observed birds to design flying  machines, studied architecture to make maps, and mastered optics and color so  that his paintings, such as the "Mona Lisa," radiate with warmth and intensity.  </P> <P> "For him, art and science were the same, and their purpose was to lead to  truth, to an understanding of the secrets of man and of the universe," writes  Richard McLanathan in the IBM catalogue that accompanies the exhibit.  </P> <P> Perhaps no better example of that quest can be found than in da Vinci's  notebooks, which by the time he died in 1519 were filled with inventions  ranging from the practical to the fantastic, from the gruesome to the sublime.  </P> <P> The modern models are the work of Roberto Guatelli, an engineer from Milan who  was commissioned in the late 1930s by Benito Mussolini to replicate 156 of the  devices. All of them were destroyed in bombing raids during World War II.  </P> <P> But after the war, Guatelli came to the United States, where he built another  56 models for a show that opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in  1950. The following year, IBM hired Guatelli to continue making the models, and  for the last four decades they have been on almost continual tour in this  country and around the world.  </P> <P> "I feel like he is my dead grandfather," Guatelli once said of da Vinci. "If he  were here, he would chase me around the block yelling, 'What are you doing to  my work?' "  </P> <P> "Leonardo da Vinci: The Inventions" will be on display Monday through April 14  at the Fine Arts Gallery at Cal State Northridge, 18111 Nordhoff St. Gallery  hours are noon to 4 p.m. Mondays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesdays through Fridays,  10 a.m. to 4 p.m. March 18 and April 1 and 8, and noon to 4 p.m. April 9.  Admission is free.  </P></p>

			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / City's share settlement system starting to show results The Bank of England's determination to deliver a faster, paperless share settlement system to the City of London is showing some real results. While the London Stock Exchange dithered for nearly seven years over its failed Taurus system, the Bank has been able to lay the foundation for a far simpler and cheaper system aimed at delivering the same thing. But for all its efforts, the Bank faces some very real hurdles in the months ahead. Yesterday it conceded that its timetable for a continuous system of share settlement - when buyers obtain title to shares and sellers obtain payment - five days after a deal has been struck may have been too ambitious. Privately, market participants yesterday heaved a sigh of relief. 'There is a concern that we may have over-committed to January 1995 as a firm date for T plus Five (settlement five days after trade date),' said an official at one London merchant bank. The London Investment Banking Association, the Institutional Fund Managers Association and the Association of Private Client Stockbrokers and Investment Managers have all urged the Bank of England to delay the date for five-day rolling settlements. Their concerns have focused on whether those who have promised to deliver stock to customers will really be able to do so within the five-day period. The Bank's research found that about 30 per cent of all deals struck within six days of a settlement date failed to settle. Even more worrying is that the majority of these are for small, private clients, the portion of the securities industry whose interests the Bank of England needs to protect most. The only way for stockbrokers to ensure that they can deliver stock is to improve the facilities available for borrowing stock from other shareholders and that, they say, is both a legal and technological minefield. Mr Michael Robarts, a director at Robert Fleming Asset Management, said that one big problem is that current practice requires stock lenders - usually pension funds or life insurers - to accept collateral in the form of Talisman certificates. These are certificates showing the value of the borrower's securities still lodged in the exchange's Talisman settlements system. 'We believe - and we are convinced that most fund managers believe - that it is inappropriate to lend pension trustees' stocks against equity-based certificates,' Mr Robarts said. The true value of these certificates and the lender's ownership position is uncertain. If the borrower of the stock suddenly became insolvent, it is not clear how the lender could recover the value of his securities. Moreover, only marketmakers in a particular stock are allowed to borrow it directly. That means that all others market participants, such as agency stockbrokers, may still be unable to deliver shares on time. 'Already there are a significant number of 'fails' in the Talisman system with 14-day account settlement,' said one private client stockbroker. On July 18, the stock exchange's Talisman system will change from the current two-week account settlement period in which all bargains struck in that time settle on the same date. It aims to move to a five-day rolling settlement in which shares settle on the fifth day after any deal is struck. By the end of the year, the Bank should have a better idea of the difficulties associated with faster settlement and will be able to set a realistic date for T plus five, according to Mr Pen Kent, associate director of the Bank of England. Meanwhile, the Bank's ambitious drive to have its 'Crest' project wholly owned by its users appears to have fallen somewhat short of its goal. The Bank said yesterday that only 50 City institutions had signed up to be shareholders in Crest. They will have to make a cash contribution ranging from Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 750,000 by October.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] New Delhi, April 8 (YONHAP) -- A North Korean  ambassador warned Friday that his country will go nuclear,  accusing Japan of posing an atomic threat to the Korean  peninsula.    The threat of Japanese nuclear weapons development is being  actualized, North Korean envoy to India Cha Pong-chu said in a  keynote speech to the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia  and the Pacific (ESCAP).    Tokyo currently possesses enough plutonium to make 6,500  nuclear weapons, Cha claimed, demanding that the Japanese  Government announce to the world it will not go nuclear.    If Japan did choose the nuclear option, the inter-Korean  agreement on denuclearization would become meaningless, he said,  reasoning that North Korea would then have to pursue its own  nuclear program.    Cha, a former vice foreign minister, said in an earlier  interview with YONHAP News Agency that Pyongyang would decide  whether to produce nuclear weapons after considering all  external threats.</p>

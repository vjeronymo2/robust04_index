			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Commuter train becomes TV star JAPANESE commuter trains are infamous for their overcrowding. Even though 'salary men' on Tokyo's Yamanote line may be too squashed to read their newspapers, they are now able to watch television. JR East Japan has installed 24 liquid crystal display television sets, each with 8.6in screens, above the windows on the walls of its carriages. More than 1,000 carriages on the line have been fitted with the Sharp mini-screens. Sharp: Japan, 06 621 1221.</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNCIL HIT OVER REFINERY PLAN  </P> <P> Neighborhood leaders from southwest Carson accused City Council members Tuesday  of subjecting residents to "environmental abuse" by not opposing a  controversial project at the Fletcher Oil refinery.  </P> <P> Barbara Post, spokeswoman for project opponents, charged that council members  are too close to industry and fail to heed neighborhood concerns.  </P> <P> Fletcher is building a $16-million vacuum distillation unit that will allow  production of asphalt at the refinery, located between Figueroa and Main  streets near the Harbor Freeway.  </P> <P> Post said Fletcher's conditional use permit, approved by the city in 1978, has  expired and the project cannot proceed until an environmental impact report is  updated.  </P> <P> "It certainly appears that someone really screwed this one up," Post said. "If  you have any integrity, fix this one and fix it fairly."  </P> <P> She warned council members: "We can put you in office, and we can take you  out."  </P> <P> Another resident, Shaaron MacLeod, said the project will subject homeowners to  "environmental abuse" by increasing pollution and noise. "We are saying no more  in our back yard."  </P> <P> In response, Councilwoman Vera Robles DeWitt volunteered to attend a South  Coast Air Quality Management District meeting on May 31 to read a letter from  the council questioning issuance of air quality permits for the project.  </P> <P> City Atty. Glenn Watson also softened his previous position that the city had  no basis for requiring Fletcher to do an updated environmental impact report.  </P> <P> "Fletcher may have not used the permit within the time required by law," Watson  said. "If it lapsed, then I would have to re-examine the question."  </P></p>

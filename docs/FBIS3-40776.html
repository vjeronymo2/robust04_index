			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Jammu, December 25--Leaders of seven Kashmiri Pandit  organisations demanded that the term "migrant," used for them,  should be changed to "displaced" to entitle Pandits, uprooted  from the Valley, to a "displacement allowance."    The leaders told reporters here on Thursday that 6,000  houses  in the Valley belonging to the Pandits had been burnt down by  militants. They said that it was the government's responsibility  to protect the remaining 80,000 houses as also the Hindu shrines  and demanded adequate compensation for any loss or damage to  their property.    They said 1,200 Kashmiri Pandits had been killed in the  Valley in militancy-related incidents but the government had not  been able to provide adequate compensation to the affected  families.    Their other demands included pucca accomodation, better  education facilities and job opportunities.    The leaders said that the talk of a homeland for them was  premature. They said conditions had to be created first for  their return to the Valley.    They said the only policy the Centre had on the Kashmiris  since 1947 was one of "appeasement" of Kashmiri Muslims. They  said that Pakistan had almost succeeded in making the Valley  "Hinduless." No political process in the Valley would be deemed  as complete without the involvement of representatives of Jammu,  Ladakh and "migrant" Pandit community, they said.</p>

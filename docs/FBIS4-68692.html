			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with G. Troitskiy, Armavir administration chief, </F> by Irina Goryunova, Armavir-Moscow: "G. Troitskiy: There Must Be  Just One Authority: Responsibly Executive"]    [Text] Georgiy Konstantinovich Troitskiy is in love  with his work and with his city. This is obvious immediately,  after one hour's acquaintance. The Armavir administration chief,  chairman of the Association of Administration Chiefs of East  Kuban, champion of Russia, and captain of the Russian combined  team for all-round sports loves to walk, is an excellent dancer,  and can talk very interestingly about former Politburo members  with whom he worked and about someone else from his hometown,  the former USSR President... But today the thing that excites  him more than anything else in the world is life in Armavir,  this particle of Kuban, particle of the Caucasus, and particle  of our common Homeland, a city that is ethnically diverse,  filled with springtime beauty, and rich in good people and  fertile land.    [Goryunova] Georgiy Konstantinovich, your biography, your  ties with our country's prominent figures, your successes in the  management field, and a number of high positions have not  prevented from returning once again to the city where your  career began. Why?    [Troitskiy] The bulk of my activity has been linked with  Armavir. I began here. For about five years I was the deputy  chairman of an executive committee. Here in Armavir I became a  deputy to the city and kray soviet. For nine years I worked as  the chairman of the city soviet. That experience and that  baggage have been extremely helpful for me in my current work.  In addition, experience that proved to be beneficial for me was  my work in Stavropol Kray, and later in Rostov, where I worked  closely with Mingasprom [Ministry of the Gas Industry], which  was administered by Chernomyrdin, who was the customer for my  main administration. So more than two years ago I decided to  return to my city.    [Goryunova] For many years you worked in the system of an  authority that is now called an administrative-fiat system.  Although you were always closely linked with the economy, the  gas industry, and construction. Today you are working in the  system of another authority. Do you make comparisons frequently,  and to whose advantage are those comparisons?    [Troitskiy] Every authority has its negative and positive  sides. Practically every authority is not to people's liking  sometimes. And a person who is on his wa to power must take that  into consideration in his practice. During the days before  perestroyka things were easier on the job. For many reasons.  Including the fact that there was discipline. It used to be  possible to resolve many questions more quickly. But the  negative aspects of party leadership, and in particular the  equalization policy and the lack of talent among many leaders,  immediately manifested themselves in the collapse of the CPSU.  The system of allocations by fiat precluded not only creativity,  but also taught people how to live with ready-make decisions.  The individual's sense of being a property owner was completely  destroyed. For example, I repeatedly asked the party agencies  the question: why, while protecting merchants' homes as  monuments of urban construction, did you categorically ban the  construction even of buildings with one and a half stories? The  city was filled with sheds and hovels. Today we are having to  live with much of our past inheritance.    I am alarmed by the lack of a mechanism for  interrelationships between the authority and the enterprises.  The executive authority today senses this problem in an  especially acute way. A number of laws also are not particularly  gratifying. For example, the law that has already been enacted  by the old Supreme Soviet, to the effect that only the first  person has the right to apply his signature. This not only puts  an additional workload on me, but also deprives my deputies of  their responsibility and initiative.    [Goryunova] Armavir is an ethnically diverse city. Under the  conditions of the current aggravation of the ethnic conflicts  and taking into consideration the especially complicated  situation in the Caucasus, how are you coping with the problems  that arise?    [Troitskiy] People of 79 nationalities live in our city. Of  them, 15 percent are Armenians, more than half of whom are old  indigenous residents. The general directedness in their life and  the language that they use are Russian. The segment of the  Armenian population that is in conflict and that emigrated to  our area from Abkhazia, Azerbaijan, and Nagornyy Karabakh, is  actually creating the difficulties. Although, for the time  being, the situation is being regulated. The Krasnodar Kray  leadership is taking strict measures and is monitoring the  registration process strictly.    I grew up in the Caucasus. I have worked in Armenia,  Georgia,  and Azerbaijan. I survived the Armenian earthquake and  participated in the restoration of the republic. I know this  region very well. And I also know that there are no poor  nationalities. There are only poor people. That has always been  my position.    [Goryunova] What is the political role of the Cossack  population in your region?    [Troitskiy] The Labinskiy section was created in Armavir as  long ago as the tsarist days. It includes representatives of the  Cossack population from six or seven areas, including Stavropol  and Karachayevo-Cherkessia. So one can say that we have a  Cossack center. The Cossacks have sufficient authority. When  they operate within the confines of legislation, the  administration helps and supports them. But it also happens that  they operate from a position of strength and attempt to force  their decisions and ideas on people. Inasmuch as the Cossacks  are an emotional people, disputes occur, and they are not simple  ones. Their program openly proclaims a fight for power: within a  two-year period, the changing over to ataman rule.    [Goryunova] As the administration chief, are you opposed to  this?    [Troitskiy] If this is done by election, in the legislative,  parliamentary way, they have my blessing. But they are  attempting to operate from a position of strength. And that is a  violation of legislation.    [Goryunova] Can you give any examples?    [Troitskiy] One does not have to go far. A sovkhoz hires  workers of various nationalities. The people are working on a  long-term basis, and working conscientiously. A Cossack raid is  carried out, and they are driven out. This is interference in  the economic activity of the sovkhoz, the inflicting of  psychological, economic, and political damage. I have repeatedly  said that you cannot establish power with a lash. Everyone does  not like a lash. It is possible to seize power. Power is not a  joy. So making life better for people, while being in power, is  a task that is a bit more complicated.    [Goryunova] Judged on the basis of economic importance, your  city is the second one in Krasnodar Kray. Everyone realizes that  the recession throughout the country has also affected you. How  are you combatting this situation?    [Troitskiy] We are all tied up into the same bundle. In my  opinion, nobody won from the destruction of the Union. And that  includes our city. Nevertheless, whereas in 1992 the recession  for Russia as a whole and for Krasnodar Kray was approximately  20 percent, in our city it was 4-5 percent lower, and the same  situation prevailed in 1993. This is linked with the fact that  Armavir is surrounded by large-scale agricultural areas. The  peasants spend less time at rallies. They do not have time for  them. The cow wants something to eat, and the land needs care.  Therefore the peasants still work the way they used to. We have  a considerable branch for processing agricultural produce. We  have one of the largest meat-packing plants in Russia, and a  large oil and fats combine. These branches were practically  untouched by the recession. But the metal-processing industry  really was hit badly. Such large-scale associations as  Tochmashpribor and Elektrotekhnicheskiy Zavod today have a  production slump of more than 50 percent.    Of course, the thing that largely saves us is the fact that  Armavir is one of a few cities in Russia that have their own  land totaling more than 200,000 hectares.    [Goryunova] Is the privatization of the land in progress?    [Troitskiy] We are not speeding up this process. It is a  pity  that even today, as used to be the case in previous times, much  is being done by the fiat method. Including privatization. In a  few places people want to be privatized, and in a few places  they do not want to be. Certain people want to work the way that  they used to. So the sovkhozes have been practically preserved.  It is simply that now they are called associations. Nevertheless  we already have 47 individually owned farms. Every city dweller  has either a vegetable garden, or a plot where he lives, and  some people have two or three each. Approximately 10-12  hundredths per resident. For purposes of comparison: in the  Netherlands, it is 3 hundredths per capita. Moreover, half is  for export. That is the low effectiveness of land use that we  have.    [Goryunova] You have worked in various branches of authority  --representative and executive. What is your attitude toward the  present system of authority? What do you think is hindering its  normal functioning?    [Troitskiy] I am absolutely convinced that there should be  no  representative authority. What we need is a legislative agency.  My entire vast experience proves this. The authority must be  responsibly executive. But we do not have a single monitoring  agency that is responsible for anything. Therefore the process  of the struggle between the two branches is endless. The  representative agencies want to direct the executive authority  and want to shift the errors and responsibility to it. The  authority, I repeat, must be just one. It must bear the  legislative responsibility. But in our area the court does not  operate! So the representative authority assumes the  allocational and monitoring functions. So long as that exists,  we shall not live any better.    If one speaks about today's Government, I would begin with  the major consideration. Until it turns its head toward the  commodity producer, and as long as the banks enrich themselves  at the expense of the producer, the strained economic and  political atmosphere will be preserved. And, secondly: the  executive, economic authority must not engage in politics. But  our Government, by delving into politics, is ignoring economic  matters. It is necessary immediately to begin thinking about the  producer, and to remove those stifling taxes -- the strangle  holds of the banking system. Then the people will begin to  breathe again, I assure you, and the rallies will end. Thirdly:  it is necessary urgently to reduce the apparatus. It is  expensive and uncontrollable.    [Goryunova] Today there is a holiday in your city. The  home-museum of your hometown writer Savva Dangulov is being  opened, with an exhibition of his second collection "The Artist  and the Muse"...    [Troitskiy] Savva Artemyevich was a remarkable person who  ardently loved our city. We were friends. I helped to implement  his idea and dream of creating an art gallery in the downtown  children's library. The home-museum is finally opening, and I  hope that it will become the cultural center of Armavir. The  creative intellectuals will gather here. I am absolutely  convinced that, without the development of culture or is  preservation, it is impossible to build anything. Today the lack  of culture is pulling us toward the West. It is necessary for  culture to be the property of everyone, not just a matter for  the intellectuals.</p>

			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Private investors urged to buy gilts THE Bank of England is taking steps to encourage private-investor purchases in gilts as the government battles to fund its growing budget deficit, Philip Coggan writes. For the forthcoming auction of 7 1/4 per cent Treasury stock 1998, the Bank will be publishing for the first time shortened application forms in the national press. These are designed specially for private investors making so-called non-competitive bids - where the price is set by the market. The Bank said falling inflation and interest rates had increased private-investor enthusiasm for gilts. It did not want to mount an aggressive mass-marketing campaign for gilts but it could provide information and easy dealing facilities. To meet the first objective the Bank published a free booklet earlier this month to explain the intricacies of gilts to the small investor. About 60,000 people have requested the guide, and some 300,000 booklets have been placed in post offices. To improve dealing facilities, the Treasury recently increased to Pounds 25,000 the amount of stock which could be bought via the cheap dealing service at post offices. Investing in gilts - a guide for the small investor. Available from post offices or by phoning 0800 616814.</p>

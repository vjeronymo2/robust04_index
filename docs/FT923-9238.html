			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Observer: Bankers balked Sharp-eyed readers of Banking World may have noticed a slight change in the recent full-page colour advertisements for prints of Classic Yachts of the World. The late Robert Maxwell's floating gin palace, Lady Ghislaine, features in them both. However, the latest version no longer highlights the bankers' special discount on a Lady Ghislaine print signed by Maxwell's skipper, Gus Rankin. It appears that some office wallah inside Banking World, the official journal of The Chartered Institute of Bankers, felt his masters might not be too pleased by yet another reminder of how much money has been sunk into the Maxwell empire. Motto of the above tale: don't make fun of bankers, even when you are paying them.</p>

			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Phased Ecu launch a necessity Sir, As a proponent of free trade between the North American Free Trade Area and the EU - if anything, to counter the Japanese challenge more effectively  -I am disheartened by opposition, especially in the UK, to proposals by Germany and France to launch the Ecu in phases, the so-called multi-speed approach. The EU will probably have some 16 to 20 members by the end of this decade - the target date for monetary union - and it is unrealistic to expect consensus by all involved, given wide disparities in social and economic development. Put another way, it is highly doubtful that all members will have met the stringent fiscal and budgetary discipline required by Maastricht. Decision-making in such an unwieldy assortment of nations needs to be revised anyway, to make it a functioning and effective union. So the idea of getting the Ecu off the ground by those countries which are fully committed to it and could qualify now under Maastricht strikes me as necessary, and the only way to move Europe towards a single currency. It is critical if the EU is to remain internationally competitive (not to speak of its psychological impact). That Europe needs to rid itself of (now) 12 currencies in the space of 2.35m sq km (the size of Zaire or Sudan or Algeria) is self-evident. Such a number of currencies promotes inefficiencies for business and individuals alike. It is hopelessly ponderous and, in these days of fast trains crossing countries in mere hours, it does not make sense any more. The yen and dollar now rule the world. A union with 450m people, soon to exceed half a billion, can no longer be left behind. The 'inner core' initiative, probably encompassing France, Germany and the Benelux, should be applauded by the rest of the EU members. They are taking the risks. While the Ecu will not replace national currencies at this stage, and would amount to alternative tender, the whole initiative could fail. But it is a beginning that needs to be tried, lest the Maastricht ideals fall apart. Andrew Van Husten, Van Husten International Co, 1847 Acacia Hill Drive, Diamond Bar, California 91765, US</p>

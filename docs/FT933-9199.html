			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Docklands body wins legal aid ruling THE LONDON Docklands Development Corporation made legal history yesterday when it became the first defendant to be given leave by the High Court to challenge the granting of legal aid to people suing it for damages. The corporation can now seek judicial review of the Legal Aid Board's decision to grant aid to 800 residents claiming compensation for noise and dust pollution and interference with television reception arising from the docklands redevelopment. Legal aid was granted to the residents in November 1991 and extended in January this year to allow writs to be issued against the corporation, the Docklands Light Railway, and Olympia &amp; York, the developers of Canary Wharf. The residents claim the unprecedented level of construction work resulted in a reduction in the quality of life and loss of enjoyment of both homes and community. Ms Sally Moore, a partner of Leigh Day &amp; Co, the London solicitors representing the residents, said: 'This is an unprecedented step for a defendant to take when faced with the prospect of being sued by a legally aided party.' The corporation made an unsuccessful attempt in 1991 to persuade the Legal Aid Board not to grant aid to the residents. Now it says the board's decision should be set aside because it did not look at each case individually. If the High Court agrees, all the cases would have to be reconsidered by the board. The corporation's action would delay the hearing of the residents' case, Ms Moore said. She also said a decision in the corporation's favour could have profound consequences for other legal aid cases.</p>

Alcatel China and the ministry would have equal shares in  the  companies set up to work on equipment for transmission by  Hertzian wave and by cable.    The first of these, called Alcatel of Beijing Transmission  Systems, would produce and distribute Hertzian transmission  equipment and portable equipment of the same type for the  Chinese market.    The second, Alcatel of Chengdu Communication Systems, would  produce and distribute cable transmission equipment for the  Chinese market.    The Chinese market in these sectors is believed to be worth  one billion dollars during the next five years, Alcatel said.    The Chinese telecommunications infrastructure grew by 40  percent between 1992 and 1993, the company said.    Alcatel is a leader on the Chinese market for digital  transmission equipment, holding 50 percent of the market.    France and China put their relations on a normal footing on  January 12 following a period of tension which ended with a  decision by France to cease selling weaponry to Taiwan.</p>

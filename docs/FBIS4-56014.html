			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] In the Journalists' House in Bratislava this  morning the chairmen of the Party of the Democratic Left, the  Social Democratic Party of Slovakia, the Slovak Green Party, and  the Farmers' Movement signed a coalition agreement on election  and postelection cooperation. The leaders of these political  entities said that the signing of the coalition agreement is the  first decision of this kind taken on the Slovak political scene  and that it is the first step toward shaping the Slovak  political scene in line with a normal West European model.    Democratic Left [PDL] Party Chairman Peter Weiss answered  questions concerning the future of the bloc of left-wing parties  put to him by editor Ivan Samel:    [Begin recording] [Samel] Mr. Chairman, are you not afraid  that this bloc might encounter a fate similar to that  encountered by the Democratic Party when the rightwing parties  tried to merge? [Words indistinct]    [Weiss] We are neither merging nor uniting. What we want is  cooperation. Our considerations are based on the fact that  today's signing of the coalition agreement between these four  political parties is an important event on the Slovak political  scene which is still lacking its final shape and the evolution  of which is still in the making. [passage omitted]    We are optimists. We intend to turn this coalition into an  instrument of election victory.    [Samel] Do you contemplate a possibility of a further  enlargement of the campaign bloc?    [Weiss] All the four partners proposed that the Association  of Workers of Slovakia should join an open coalition. Although  the proposal was not accepted, our offer on post-election  cooperation is still on the table. It is up to the Association  of Workers of Slovakia to decide.    [Samel] On more than one occasion you have expressed a  willingness to cooperate with the present coalition partners in  the government even after the elections. After concluding the  coalition, do you regard that option as being still open or  topical?    [Weiss] It is a likely option, but one naturally cannot jump  the result of the elections. We would like to emerge from the  elections in a situation which would allow us to say who will be  our coalition partners. Of course, much will depend on how the  present government coalition performs. So far, we have been  able to overcome all natural differences of views that exist  among the left, the center, and the rightwing coalition  partners, by holding rational and civilized discussions.

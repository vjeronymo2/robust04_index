			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Radio-link residential telephone service licensed ONE MILLION British homes could have telephone aerials on their roofs by early next century if a service licensed by the government yesterday is as successful as its promoters claim. Ionica, a new enterprise set up by telecommunications industry executives, has developed a technology based on radio links which it believes will provide a low-cost alternative to the telephone service currently provided by BT. It will be targeted at residential and small-business customers. Since last year's government review of telecommunications policy, most parts of the market have been open to competition. The market for providing phone lines to residential customers is still almost a total BT monopoly, although cable television companies have recently been making inroads. Mr Nigel Playford, managing director of Ionica and founder of paging company Cognito, said: 'We intend to undercut BT on price across the board.' He said that the service would be available to half the population within two years of its launch and that his Cambridge-based company planned to win at least five per cent of the residential market in its first 10 years. The Ionica system uses a radio link from the exchange to a six-inch aerial on the customer's roof. The use of radio rather than a cable would cut costs and allow rapid installation of the service, Mr Playford said. He added that the technology would allow a higher quality of service than that provided by the cellular system, which is also based on radio links. Ionica is backed by a group of private investors and advised by Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. It refused to say how much money it would need to launch its service or how it would be financed. Mr John Redwood, corporate affairs minister, said Ionica's approach 'offers the chance to receive the full benefits of a telephone service without the need for wires to be installed either above or below ground.' Ionica is to be allocated part of the radio spectrum near the 3GHz frequency band now used by the armed forces. Ionica may have to share the waveband, although there is apparently no danger of the calls being mixed up. There is bound to be some scepticism over whether Ionica's plans are viable following the failure of telepoint, a radio-based telephone service licensed by the government in the late 1980s.</p>

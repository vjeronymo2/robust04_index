			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV AND VIDEO  </P> <P> "I Love Lucy" Pilot Discovered: The original pilot for "I Love Lucy," which has  been missing for 40 years, has been found under a bed where it had been  forgotten for 39 years. Joanne Perez, the widow of vaudeville performer Pepito  the Spanish clown, discovered a copy of the pilot -- a gift to her husband from  Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.  </P> <P> Pepito had coached Ball in some of her stage routines, and guest-starred on the  pilot. Although Perez knew she had one of the show's episodes in her  possession, she didn't realize which one or the value of it until a recent  conversation with B. Donald (Bud) Grant, who will coordinate an hour-long  special to air in May on CBS which will include the 34-minute pilot as well as  tributes to the show and cast. The 34-minute print is apparently the only one  in existence.GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Aleksey Filatov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 10 TASS -- Russian Vice-Premier Aleksandr  Zaveryukha is sharply opposed to the reported "plans to  decollectivize" the Russian agriculture which, in his opinion,  may produce "unpredictable social consequences".    Interviewed by ITAR-TASS, Zaveryukha described these  proposals as a "rash" and blamed the radical democratic circles  for them.    "Radicalism is unacceptable in agriculture. The land reform  will yield fruit only if it develops in an evolutionary way,"  Zaveryukha said, adding that "some radical democrats dislike  it". The vice- premier did not explain whom he meant.    Plans to decollectivize agriculture before the spring sowing  campaign could be advanced only by "a man, who is poorly versed  in agricultural production in our country, and who has no idea  about developments in other countries," the vice-premier  stressed.    Moreover, Zaveryukha noted that the overwhelming majority of  Russian collective and state farms had already changed their  form of property. He said that more than 90 per cent of such  husbandries have already been turned into joint-stock societies.    "They are no longer collective and state farms, but  associations of free commodity producers with their own land  plots and shares. They are already owners. And nobody has any  right to tell them how to work and what form of management to  choose," Zaveryukha stressed.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: PNG accuses CRA mining group Kevin Brown in Sydney PAPUA NEW GUINEA (PNG) yesterday accused CRA, the Australian mining group, of acting provocatively by withdrawing staff from its Mount Kare alluvial gold mine in the isolated highlands area. CRA, a 49 per cent subsidiary of RTZ of the UK, evacuated its 15 remaining staff from the mine on Sunday, claiming that threats of violence had been made by armed local landowners. Operations were suspended last month for the third time since production began in 1990. CRA says the mine has been attacked three times by landowners, some armed with rifles and shotguns. However, Mr Masket Iangalio, mining minister, said the withdrawal followed a dispute over an outstanding debt between CRA and the receiver manager of the landowners' company, Kare-Puga Development Corporation (KDC). 'I have been advised that no landowners have entered the (mine) campsite and no property has been damaged, and that law and order is being maintained,' Mr Iangalio said in a statement released in Port Moresby.</p>

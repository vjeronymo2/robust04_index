			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / International Company News: Unidanmark back in the black UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second-largest bank group, moved back into profit of DKr483m (Dollars 69.77m) in the first half compared with a loss of DKr1.47bn in the same period last year and a loss of DKr4.54bn in the whole of 1992. The bank said the result was in line with the budget and with the recovery strategy drawn up last autumn. Costs were down by 6.2 per cent to DKr3.05bn from last year, with a reduction of 9.4 per cent in staffing to 11,453 compared with June 30 last year. But the bank's forecast for the full year was cautious, promising 'a substantially improved net result than last year,' but leaving open the possibility of a loss. The bank's loss provisions remained high at DKr2.34bn compared with DKr2.44bn in the first half of last year and DKr6.28bn in the whole of 1992. Provisions this year, the bank forecast, will be reduced. The group's London subsidiary, Unidanmark Holding, cut a DKr506m loss in the first half last year to DKr168m. The London bank suffered from heavy losses in the property market. A big improvement in the value adjustment for the securities portfolio was the main factor behind the group's move back into profit.</p>

The Hungarian deputies told their German hosts that although  the Partnership for Peace scheme was less than what East Central  Europe wanted, it was more than this region had ever got before.  The scheme does not draw new dividing lines in Europe but  promotes the region's rapproachement to NATO, at the same time  not making Russia feel that NATO is forging an alliance against  it.    Hungarian deputies asked Germany to help fill the Hungary-EC  association agreement with genuine content, and promote  Hungary's integration into the common European foreign and  security policy.    German negotiators said that admitting European Free Trade  Association [EFTA] countries was now on the agenda in the  European Union, a process that should end by January 1995. Then  a Union conference will review experiences of new members,  admissions, and the association agreements. Talks with the  Visegrad countries on full membership will not start before  1997, Kovacs quoted his German partners as saying.</p>

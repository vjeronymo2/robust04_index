			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus by Roman </F> Krasnicky in Prague; date not given: "The Free Trade Zone Is a  Test of Cooperation"]    [Text] [Krasnicky] Czech-U.S. talks will be held next week.  What do you want to say to Bill Clinton?    [Klaus] The security issue will be a dominant feature of  these talks. Nevertheless, the Czech side would like to point  out the inseparability of security and other issues and to  emphasize the connections between security policy and general  economic and social policy. We would also like to discuss how  the Czech Republic views its future and cooperation with the  United States.    [Krasnicky] People in Hungary and Poland are reproaching you  for preferring bilateral talks with U.S. officials at the Prague  meeting and not a joint course of action by the Visegrad Four  states....    [Klaus] These opinions reflect certain disappointment that  the Americans chose Prague as the place to hold their meetings  with these four countries.    I would not look for anything more profound in this. As far  as cooperation among these four countries is concerned, we have  said thousands of times that we favor cooperation in all spheres  where it is suitable. We are placing extraordinary emphasis on  the greatest test of cooperation. This test is not summits and  meetings between presidents and prime ministers but the free  trade zone. Here the Czech Republic is in the lead, while some  other countries that would be glad to have highest-level summits  are, compared with us, applying the brakes in intensifying the  free trade zone. At the same time, this cooperation is in our  most vital interest.    [Krasnicky] Our neighbors are interested in joining NATO.  Their motive is obvious. Are you also concerned about Russian  neoimperialism?    [Klaus] First, I would like to say that it was  Czechoslovakia  that told a somewhat surprised Poland and Hungary that we want  to join NATO. This is a historically proven fact, and nothing in  our conceptual decision has changed, except that in the Czech  Republic today we are making less pointed statements. Second, we  respect Partnership for Peace as an intermediary step, and our  task is to make maximum use of this concept for partnership. The  U.S. plan envisages the conclusion of individual treaties  between NATO and the individual countries. These treaties will  not be formulated unequivocally and will be able to  differentiate more between the individual participants. There  will be sufficient scope here for the Czech Republic to use this  institute if, of course, it is adopted by NATO on 11 January.    [Krasnicky] What about the Russian threat?    [Klaus] Let us in no way underestimate it. However, I would  not separate this threat from the whole issue. The Russian  threat is not a military one. It is the threat of mastering--or  of not mastering--the early postcommunist phase. This threat has  social, economic, political, and, only at a certain point,  military dimensions. At the same time, I concede that the Czech  Republic is a little further toward the West than, for instance,  Poland. This issue is more sensitive for the Poles than it is  for the Austrians, for example. In this issue, I would place us  more alongside Austria than Poland.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ray Hartley and Edyth Bulbring] </F>   [Text] President de Klerk yesterday dismissed suggestions  that he had lost the support of large sections of the SADF  [South African Defense Force], and vowed strong government  action to put down any right-wing rebellion.    Defence Minister Kobie Coetsee added that the SADF had made  contingency plans to deal with any possible violence from this  quarter.    Their strong warnings follow the announcement by the  Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front] on Thursday [10 February]  that it would not participate in the forthcoming elections.    CP [Conservative Party] leader Ferdi Hartzenberg said that,  while the Afrikaner Volksfront still wanted to attain its  volkstaat [homeland] through peaceful means, the right-wing  front would be putting "pressure on the election in various  ways."    Briefing journalists in Bloemfontein, Mr. de Klerk said: "I  have no doubt about the basic loyalty of the security forces  that, should any plans to disrupt the election come to fruition,  contingency plans are ready.    "We will not and cannot allow minorities in South Africa to  undermine the election process and to disrupt or derail that  which clearly has the support of the majority of South Africans."    Mr. de Klerk warned that violent actions aimed at derailing  the election would be countered with strong government action.    "If staying out means becoming involved in violence, we will  act firmly within the framework of the law," he said.    Right-wing suggestions that a large section of the security  forces would support a rebellion against the election were  inaccurate.    "I believe the security forces have a proud track record of  being loyal to the state ... of being non-partisan. I really  don't think in any way there is a serious threat within the  security forces," Mr. de Klerk said.    Elaborating on contingency plans, Mr. Coetsee said that the  SADF had repossessed a large number of weapons issued to private  citizens.    "Any weapons which have been issued for official use and  which have been abused will summarily be withdrawn -- as a  matter of fact we have already withdrawn a large number," he  said.    Disciplinary steps would be taken against any member of the  defence force who abused his position for political ends.    "The defence force has tightened up measures concerning the  security of its bases and installations and to safeguard its  armaments," Mr. Coetsee said.    "The defence force has launched a special communications  plan  to keep its members abreast of developments in the security and  military field."    Subversion of the principle that the defence force serves  the  elected government of the day could lead to chaos and anarchy,  he added.    Police spokesman Major Louis le Roux has confirmed special  measures to secure police stations against political threat,  reports Dirk van Heerden.    He declined to give details, but said a strategy had to be  planned by station commanders and regional police chiefs.    The SAP [South African Police] was confident it could  control  any campaign against police stations. Task forces would be made  available to stations under threat.    Major le Roux said the SAP was also confident it could  control dissident policemen.</p>

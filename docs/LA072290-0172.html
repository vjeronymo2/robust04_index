			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LAGUNA NIGUEL BAN WAS THE RIGHT MOVE;  </P> <P> BUILDING MUST HALT UNTIL PARKLAND TRANSFER IS SOLVED  </P> <P> The novice Laguna Niguel City Council showed that it could make a tough  decision last week when it voted to impose a moratorium on further construction  of homes on a disputed portion of the Marina Hills development.  </P> <P> A moratorium is essential to preserve the status quo until it is clear how 96  acres of land intended for open space ended up in the hands of a developer,  Taylor Woodrow Homes California Ltd. Nothing can be done about the 100 homes  that have been built on the land, but the dozens more that are planned  shouldn't be constructed unless all questions have been answered regarding this  transfer.  </P> <P> Besides the moratorium, the council decided to file suit for possible damages  against Taylor Woodrow -- a signal likely to reassure residents that it takes  this troubling matter seriously. It is proper that the district attorney is  conducting a criminal investigation of the mysterious transfer.  </P> <P> This much we know: The land in question, which borders on Salt Creek Corridor  Regional Park and is estimated to be worth $40 million to $70 million, was  transferred to Taylor Woodrow in 1988, two years before the city's  incorporation. James F. Krembas -- now a Laguna Niguel city councilman --  quitclaimed the acreage to Taylor Woodrow. Krembas was acting as a member of  the county's Laguna Niguel Community Services District, which was set up  pending cityhood.  </P> <P> Krembas has denied impropriety, saying he was deceived by Taylor Woodrow into  thinking he was authorizing another agreement entirely. His credibility has not  been helped, however, by the fact that his wife was hired by Taylor Woodrow  three months after the land swap took place. Krembas last week wisely abstained  from the council's decisions, which included a request for an investigation of  the actions of two other board officials -- James S. Okazaki, then the district  board's attorney, and James S. Mocalis, the chief executive of that board --  who were involved in the deed transfer.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow says Krembas was merely completing a land transfer that  previously had been approved by the county in return for a park and ball fields  in another part of what was then unincorporated county land. There certainly  appears to have been some fumbling on the part of the county planning staff  that was charged with overseeing the area, pending cityhood.  </P> <P> What can be said at this point is that many people dropped the ball. That even  may include Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, whose district includes the Marina  Hills development and who should have been looking carefully at any large land  transfers as Laguna Niguel approached cityhood.  </P> <P> It may turn out, as Krembas has said, that the transfer was an unfortunate  mistake. But no more development must take place until all legal proceedings  have been completed. To do otherwise would be to risk compounding the error.  </P> <P> The City Council, in deciding to file suit against Taylor Woodrow, said it is  not interested in calling into question the property rights of those who have  purchased homes that are already in place. But the undeveloped home sites are  another matter.  </P> <P> Taylor Woodrow President Gordon Tippell, appearing before the City Council last  week, called a Marina Hills moratorium and lawsuit "drastic" measures and  pleaded with the council to hold off.  </P> <P> To its credit, the members correctly moved decisively instead to attempt to  find out how valuable open space was forfeited to a private developer and to  seek amends for area residents.  </P></p>

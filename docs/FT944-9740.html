			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (3): Cloud hovers over insurers - A business sector that is still in the doldrums As other sectors of French business begin to climb out of recession, a continuing dark cloud hovers over many of the country's insurance companies  -highlighted by their most recent gloomy results. 'The first half results were quite disappointing,' says Ms Clotilde Basselier, an analyst with Societe Generale in Paris. 'The real estate crisis had a strong effect and caused the insurers to make huge provisions.' A large part of these property losses have nothing to do with direct investment as part of the insurers' portfolios, however. They reflect instead a historical legacy, with companies such as GAN, UAP and AGF controlling banks which, in turn, have heavy outstanding mortgage commitments. One vivid example was GAN. The group reported losses of FFr840m in the six months to June 30. Yet this was primarily result of provisions against Union Industrielle de Credit, which reported losses of FFr925m alongside agreeing a restructuring which included ring-fencing its FFr18.9bn property portfolio. 'The insurance companies were till very recently state-owned and many of the businesses they acquired were as a result of state pressure and were not part of their core strategies,' says one analyst. Divestment from this approach may prove one of the most significant challenges for the sector. However, while this process of empire building in domestic activities has perhaps already begun to fade with the privatisation of groups such as UAP, international ambitions remain at the forefront of many of the companies. Take Mr Jacques Friedman, head of UAP, who goes to China at the end of this month to prepare the way for a representative office in Beijing for his company. 'I'm convinced that within the next three to 15 years - no-one can say when - that there will be a very important increase in insurance in Asia,' he says. Mr Claude Bebear, head of Axa, says: 'Business is becoming more global and the market more concentrated. I need to be a big business myself to compete.' For him too, China and India represent vital markets for the next century. Axa is just one of several companies which is equally busy scrutinising markets more close to home. It just announced a Dollars 10m joint venture in Turkey and - like UAP - has an eye on increasing its non-life business in the UK. However, Mr Tim Dawson, an insurance analyst with Lehman Brothers in London, says: 'I have yet to see much evidence of European insurance companies becoming serious profit- and shareholder-oriented organisations. They dilute their intrinsic worth with acquisitions outside the home market. I would like to see them not thinking about being number one in Europe but aiming instead for a 15 per cent return on equity.' Another highly significant structural problem for the French insurance industry to resolve relates to its distribution network. For many years, insurance sales have been dominated by a network of tied sales agents protected by law. These are now increasingly becoming a burden. 'People always talked about agents as a barrier to entry to the market,' says Mr Dawson. 'Paradoxically, they have also become a barrier to exit.' Agents can act as a powerful lobby to prevent any commercially-justifiable increase in premiums that may lose them business to their competitors, for example. The cost and obstructiveness of the agents helped explain why a number of mutuals - with their own sales staff with low, fixed costs and an ability to screen potential clients effectively - have been able to do so well in the market. The effect was painful, with GAN, for example, cutting premiums heavily to gain market share - but more recently reaping the costs. 'There has been crazy competition because of the mutuals,' says Mr Claude Tendil, director general of Axa. Now there are now new challenges as well. The first is bancassurance, with many of the banks now dominating the market for the sale of individual life assurance. 'There has been very hard competition with the banks on life assurance for individuals,' says UAP's Mr Friedman. He adds that more complex non-life products require more experience of claims records and remain more the preserve of insurers. Equally, there is the growth of telephone insurance operations. Compared to other parts of Europe - notably the UK with its widely-copied Direct Line innovator - France remains underdeveloped. Thus AGF now has a highly successful direct car insurance arm in Spain but no equivalent in France. Axa has begun experimenting with a service in France, but only under a different name, and an attempt to keep it low profile to avoid tensions with its agents. On the other hand, insurers also have great opportunities. Life assurance sales continue to boom, which analysts put down to the demand for long-term savings products in the absence of a developed private pensions industry. It is this which is likely to prove one of the most important battlegrounds in the coming years as the industry develops and insurers fight over it with banks and other financial institutions. The risk, according to Mr Dawson, is that the government may play off pensions reform against other revenue generators. There have periodically been discussions about removing the existing tax exemption for investment income on policies more than eight years old, for example. Over the next few months, observers of the insurance scene also have two other important events to track: the scheduled privatisations of both CNP and AGF. Mention of CNP in particular causes many rivals to grind their teeth. It has a virtual monopoly of life assurance sales through post offices, tax offices and state deposit bureaux. But current discussions in the run-up to the share sales could remove this network, leaving the company with next to no goodwill. Meanwhile, Ms Basselier argues that insurers may have to get used to fundamental changes such as a drop in capital gains. But she remains relatively optimistic. 'We are expecting 1996 and 1997 results to reach more normal levels,' she says.</p>

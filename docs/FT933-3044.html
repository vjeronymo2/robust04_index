			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / Italy losing resolve on plant closures THE FATE of 333 surplus workers at an ageing state-owned phosphorus plant in southern Italy has become a test case of the government's resolve to rationalise loss-making industries at a time of rising unemployment. The workers' plight at Crotone on the Ionian coast of Calabria has also become a symbol of southern Italy's desperation with unemployment rates of 23 per cent. From President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro downwards, everyone in authority has sympathised with the workers and the government has followed the line of least resistance. As a result, the compromise solution now being hammered out looks set to disregard the government's brave talk of allowing state industries to be run as commercial operations. It also encourages the numerous other worker protests in progress, which have yet to receive full publicity, to take the law into their own hands. The 70-year-old phosphorus plant is part of a petrochemical complex owned by Enichem, the chemicals arm of Eni, the state oil concern. On September 7 the plant was occupied and vandalised in protest over plans to lay-off 333 of the 500 workers. Throughout this period the Crotone railway station has been blocked to all traffic by protesters sitting on the tracks, while drums of chemicals have obstructed the main coastal road. The authorities have made no efforts to unblock these essential communications for fear of provoking further violence involving toxic chemicals. Behind the protest lies a sorry history of disinvestment in Crotone - the oldest industrial zone in Calabria - coupled with the politically motivated planning of petrochemicals ventures in southern Italy and the change in management at Eni following its transformation in August 1992 into a joint stock company. Eni inherited the plant from Montedison through their ill-fated chemicals venture, Enimont. Although it is the sole phosphorus producer in Italy, losses have been accumulating. Last November, after 12-month losses of L24bn (Pounds 10m), it was shut down and the 333 workers were left idle on full pay. Of these, more than 100 had been reabsorbed under a court order following the failure of an Enichem project to produce tennis rackets on the site. The trigger for the protest was Enichem invoking the mechanism to lay them off - a process whereby they lose approximately 20 per cent of their pay. The workers feared this was the first step towards ultimate unemployment, and were determined to force Eni and the government to come up with alternate plans to create long-term jobs. After tortuous negotiations Eni has agreed temporarily to maintain full pay; but has tried to make the point that, as a public company, its loss-making operations have to be rationalised. No longer can it fulfil a role in the south of providing padded state employment. After three days of talks in the prime minister's office, the compromise centres on the government declaring Crotone a zone of economic emergency. This enables special state funds to be made available from the budget as well funds from the EC. These monies will aid an as yet undefined industrial project involving the Eni group and regional financial institutions. In return Eni, will take back only a small number of the 333 workers due to be laid off. This solution suggests Enichem will be subject to similar pressures when it seeks to cut some 800 of its 2,900 workforce in economically depressed Sicily. Finally the Crotone affair has played into the hands of the populist Lombard League. Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, claimed this week the south was being protected at the expense of the north where the recession is keenly felt but without such protests.</p>

The brewer, which is 59 per cent family-controlled, also announced it had conditionally agreed to acquire UK D, a wholesale distributor of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks for an initial Pounds 2.33m in loan notes and shares. Depending on profits in the year to April 3 1993, there is additional consideration of up to Pounds 540,000 in shares. BIL's bid values its target at about Pounds 11m. In the statement issued today, Gibbs Mew said that the board and other members of the family controlling 55.5 per cent of the share capital intended to reject the offer. BIL replied that the Gibbs family had attempted to present a fait accompli and had not waited for independent shareholders' views.</p>

			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE REDUCTION in interest rates in two European countries fuelled speculation of a similar move in the UK, leading to an advance in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. On its first full day as market leader, the September contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,896, well below Friday's strong finish. However, hopes of a cut in UK base rates attracted buyers to the contract, sending it sharply ahead. It not only established a strong premium to the cash market but was one of the main factors in pulling equity prices higher. While non-EC trade figures released later were greeted favourably, it was the announcement shortly after midday of a reduction in interest rates in France and later Portugal that led to further active buying. The day's high of 2,933 for the September futures contract was recorded just after lunchtime. Leading securities houses used the opportunity to arbitrage between the cash and futures markets, a factor which contributed to the day's high volume. September closed at 2,927, some 14 points above the fair value premium to cash, which now stands at 11 points. Volume was a healthy 10,125 lots. Turnover in traded options remained uninspiring, at 24,573. British Steel, which reported figures yesterday, was the most active stock option.</p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Markets Report: Lira takes knock from Berlusconi investigation The Italian lira dropped to a record low against the D-Mark after magistrates formally warned Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, that he is under investigation, writes Philip Coggan. The lira fell to L1,033/DM at the London close, from L1,025 on Monday. According to Mr Robert Thomas, head of research at NatWest Capital Markets: 'The weaker that Berlusconi becomes, the less likely it is that the budget deficit will be sorted out in the near term. The lira is suffering from the lack of firm government.' Mr David Cocker, currency analyst at Chemical Bank, thinks that while the latest political crisis may have been discounted by the market, the lira could still fall to L1,045/1,048 to the D-Mark. While Mr Berlusconi said he was 'absolutely sure' he had not committed any offence and would not resign, the news also hit Italian bond and equity markets. The Mibtel stock market index fell 2.8 per cent on the day. The US dollar weakened in London trading against both the D-Mark and the yen. Chemical Bank's Mr Cocker said profit-taking had made the dollar weaker. 'Basically, it was a market which had got a little bit long of dollars,' he added. Mr Thomas said the dollar had recently hit a technical resistance point around DM1.56 and had backtracked. On the fundamentals, he added: 'People are also beginning to realise that December might be a bit early for the Fed to raise rates again.' Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, said the 75 basis-point rise in US interest rates was 'not enough to convince the bond market that the Fed was ahead of the inflation game'. He also pointed to the recent weakness on Wall Street - the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down 200 points since October - as one factor behind the dollar's difficulties. 'The currency market thinks the Fed will find it hard to raise interest rates with Wall Street going down,' he said. 'The dilemma for the Fed is that if they do not raise rates, long bonds will suffer, and if they do raise rates, Wall Street will come under pressure.' However, the Citibank economist is cautiously optimistic about the dollar's prospects in 1995. Citibank's research shows there is increasing interest in the dollar among medium and long term fund managers and this, according to Mr MacKinnon, should give the currency some support. The D-Mark also received support from Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer. He was quoted as saying that German monetary policy will reflect the central bank's interest in a strong D-Mark. Mr Tietmeyer also appeared to rule out a move to a variable rate repo when the decision-making central council meets tomorrow. The dollar fell to DM1.5536 by the London close, from Monday's DM1.5594, and against the yen it slipped to Y98.075 from Y98.375. Trading continued to be fairly quiet, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. The New York session ended with the dollar at DM1.5534 and Y98.305. Sterling had a fairly quiet day on the currency markets, with attention focused elsewhere. However, expectations of an early interest rate rise appeared to subside. The markets have apparently decided that Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor, will attempt to shift the focus in next week's Budget to the tightening of fiscal policy and away from monetary policy. The March short sterling futures contract recovered half of Monday's loss, gaining 3 basis points at 92.98. But that still implies base rates of 7 per cent, compared with the current level of 5.75 per cent. Against the D-Mark, the pound declined to DM2.4402 from Monday's close of DM2.4452. It firmed slightly against the weaker dollar to finish at Dollars 1.5707, from Dollars 1.5681. Trade-weighted, it slipped to 79.8, from 79.9 on Monday. The Australian dollar had another good day, edging up to 76.3 cents against the US dollar, from just under 76.2 cents on Monday. The Australian currency continues to benefit from rising commodity prices and high real interest rates. In the UK money markets, the Bank of England gave help of Pounds 400m at established rates to alleviate a Pounds 500m forecast shortage. Overnight rates moved between 5.5 per cent and 4 per cent.</p>

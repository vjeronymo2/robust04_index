			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The United Mine Workers agreed to federal mediation in an effort to resolve its  strike in Virginia against the Pittston Coal Group. Virginia Lt. Gov. Douglas  Wilder said UMW President Richard L. Trumka agreed to accept a representative  of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service at the bargaining table. The  Pittston Co., the parent company of the coal mining firm, has already agreed to  mediation. Trumka also sought a seven-day cooling off period in the 27-day-old  strike, including a halt to Pittston operations, and immediate negotiations.  Meanwhile, state police arrested 140 miners trying to keep coal trucks from  leaving Pittston's Moss No. 3 preparation plant in Russell County and reported  seven miners hurt when struck by a truck leading a convoy.  </P></p>

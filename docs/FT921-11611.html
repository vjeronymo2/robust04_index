			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Occidental Petroleum back in black OCCIDENTAL Petroleum, the energy group which has undergone a significant restructuring over the past year, yesterday reported fourth-quarter net income of Dollars 6m, or 2 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 2bn, or Dollars 6.76 a share, a year ago when it took a Dollars 2.05bn charge to cover the shake-up, writes Martin Dickson. However, Occidental's oil and gas divisional earnings were only Dollars 54m, against Dollars 124m before charges in 1990, due to lower oil prices. Natural gas transmission earnings were unchanged at Dollars 86m and chemical divis -ion earnings dipped from Dollars 126m, before charges, to Dollars 38m.</p>

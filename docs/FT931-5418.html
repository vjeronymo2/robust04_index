			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays in record trading ALTHOUGH widely rumoured in the stock market from as far back as early October, the halved final dividend and appalling preliminary figures from Barclays saw the bank's shares plummet in exceptionally heavy trading. Turnover of 53m shares yesterday was by far the biggest single day's business in the stock since activity levels were first recorded at the time of Big Bang, in 1986. Marketmakers chopped opening levels for Barclays from an overnight 433p to 405p as the dividend news was flashed up on the trading screens. The mark-down, however, failed to stem a very heavy flow of selling orders, mostly from the City's important and influential income funds. At worst the shares dropped to 381p before settling 41, or almost 10 per cent, down at 392p. Other bank shares failed to participate in Barclays' discomfort, with many of the income funds moving quickly to shift their holdings out of Barclays and into other bank stocks regarded as having secure dividends. While many banking specialists continued to view Barclays as a strong recovery play, others remain unconvinced. Mr Martin Hughes, banks analyst at Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL) and who first forecast the dividend cut in early October, said: 'They are not out of the woods; the next area of bad news will come from Europe, where big losses will offset any UK recovery.' The CLL analyst reduced his current-year profits estimate to Pounds 367m and expects the dividend payout to be held to the same level as for 1992. 'The shares are high risk and should be sold,' he added, recommending a switch into Lloyds, 7 higher at 547p, Royal Bank of Scotland, 6 up at 318p, TSB, 4 better at 175p, and Abbey National.</p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> KING ASKS OPPOSITION LEADER TO BE INTERIM NEPAL PRIME MINISTER  </P> <P> King Birendra today bowed to a groundswell for further democratic reform and  asked a veteran opposition leader to be prime minister of an interim  government, the opposition party announced.  </P> <P> Earlier today, Birendra announced the resignation of Prime Minister Lokendra  Bahadur Chand and the dissolution of the no-party legislature.  </P> <P> The developments ended a week of political deadlock that ensued after the king  yielded on April 8 to demands that a 29-year-old ban on political parties be  lifted.  </P> <P> Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, the prime minister-designate and acting president of  the long-banned Nepali Congress Party, said he will present a Cabinet on  Tuesday.  </P> <P> Bhattarai also said King Birendra indicated during a meeting today with  opposition leaders that he will look favorably upon the idea of becoming a  constitutional monarch, foresaking the near-absolute power he has wielded for  his 18 years on the throne.  </P> <P> Also today, a youth gang set fire to a movie theater ticket office and stoned  another empty cinema, prompting the capital's four other theaters to close. It  is not known why the gang targeted the movie theaters, located 500 yards from  the royal palace.  </P></p>

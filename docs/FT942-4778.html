			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Arts: Danger of overkill - Television Television's habit of overdoing things is now chronic. Whether it is World Cup football or the 50th anniversary of D-Day, the rule is to supply more material than the most fanatical enthusiast could possibly want. The reason is surely clear: television executives may insist they are thinking of the viewers but, consciously or sub-consciously, they are actually thinking of their bosses and their competitors. The big question becomes 'What will they do that I'm not doing, and how can I outdo them?' Of all the D-Day material I saw, the two best programmes were among the most conventional. D-Day: Turning The Tide on BBC1, was produced by Mark Fielder and presented by Charles Wheeler. It used the simple device of getting some of those who participated, and survived, to describe their experiences to camera, with an inlaid photograph (printed in sepia even though sepia went out of fashion round about 1920; for today's young programme makers sepia just means 'old') showing how they looked in 1944. It was enthralling and moving because of the detail: the Para commander who found his troop-carrying glider was too heavy, called for a volunteer to stay behind, failed to get one, and jettisoned some gear instead; the marine raised in awe of naval officers who saw a captain standing, though the marine did not realise it, on the deck of a midget submarine at periscope level, leading the landing craft in to the beach, who whispered 'Jesus, they really do walk on water'; and the Normandy woman who witnessed the start of the huge Allied naval bombardment and raced back to her family saying 'The sea is firing. I come to die with you'. Given the dreadful lack of original programmes on satellite television, it is good to be able to report that the other memorable documentary was Normandy: The Great Crusade produced by the Discovery channel. The style here was even more conventional, but the programme had two strengths: it was made almost entirely from archive film, and it presented evidence as readily from French and German survivors as from the invaders. Much of television's D-Day material was remarkably jingoistic, but this was an admirably academic piece of work. The frequency with which television now launches new series about 'idiosyncratic' detectives is absurd. Two weeks ago it was Derek Jacobi's new-age mediaeval monk, Cadfael. Last week, on BBC1, it was Glaswegian Charlie King, The Negotiator who (you will not believe this) is hard boiled, streetwise, a loner, hates desk work, fights his own bosses as well as the bad guys, and commands the respect of the villains. Can you believe that anybody could be so unoriginal? Brian Cox takes the title role. The last time he played such a character was when he took the title role in Grushko . . . last month. Political correctness seems to have a frightening hold over more and more BBC journalism. Traditionally one of the key functions of the journalist has been to stand aside and say, as it were, 'I know you people and the church and the king and all those scientists insist that the earth is flat, but where is your evidence?' and to go on asking even if - particularly if - told that the truth is obvious to anyone with eyes in their head. Instead of feeding us the politically correct Bel Mooney line on roads ('There are now enough by-passes for me so nobody else should be allowed to have one') Public Eye on BBC2 would have been better employed doing a proper social audit on road building. However, the worst example last week was not just politically correct but a striking example of the sort of sanctimonious tabloid journalism which is now moving out of the small square newspapers and onto the small square screen. Inside Story on BBC1 pursued a man whom it accused of sexually abusing teenage boys. It did not set out to report on sexual relations between adults and children generally; had it done so, it might have begun with the fact that the ancient Greeks, to many the cynosure of civilisation, saw love between man and boy as the real thing and adult heterosexual intercourse as a dutiful necessity for the continuation of the race. Today, in the age of feminism, you are nothing if not a self proclaimed victim, so the Greek ideal is reversed, as in this programme, and becomes 'paedophilia'. No attempt was made to establish whether, as fashion now dictates, making love with children really is the most damaging crime of all. It is politically correct to assume that and so the programme used every cheap trick in the book - from mood music to repetitive shots of sad children's faces in big closeup - to purvey emotion rather than analysis. The first time ITV's rugby commentator in Pretoria used the expression on Saturday I could scarcely believe it. 'And there goes Charlie Farnsbarns, b*llocking forward]' he exclaimed. When he said it again I realised that the word was 'bullocking', and that it was being used to mean charging straight into the opposition (on the crash ball, as Bill McLaren says). It would seem advisable to avoid this new minted verb in future. First it sounds exactly like the much more familiar but far ruder word and, second, bullocks seem more given to skipping around like spring lambs than charging like bulls. On the subject of sports commentators, it is time that somebody - the exemplary Richie Benaud, perhaps - told Geoffrey Boycott that the art of commentary does not consist in repeating the same grumpy insults over and over again, and that if you have nothing fresh to say it might be best to keep quiet for a bit. When New Zealand began their second innings at Trent Bridge on Sunday, Boycott, speaking for Grandstand on BBC1, made very clear his chagrin when Devon Malcolm failed to take a wicket in the first few overs. Then he made it clear again. Then again. Boycott is not enough of a linguistic wizard to make such repetition interesting.</p>

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / Arts: Sinfonietta celebrates With its penchant for celebrating anniversaries, the London Sinfonietta is spending this season feting its own twenty-fifth. Self-congratulatory, of course, but pardonable: most of the music in this series was, indeed, commissioned or co-commissioned by the Sinfonietta and its fraternal Voices, and on average the quality has been bracingly high. Still, claiming 'to have defined the course of contemporary music over these past 25 years' is a bit strong. Since the end of the 1970s, the course of 'contemporary music' has branched into rivulets; the Sinfonietta has managed to dip a cautious toe into many of them, unlike more doctrinaire ensembles, but mostly it is loyal to its own favourites. Saturday's programme at the Queen Elizabeth Hall started with Oliver Knussen conducting his own Coursing (1979), potent and thrilling as ever - first a wild unison tootling by everybody, gradually overlaid and underpinned by slower strands which at last make a towering wall of sound. All that in just six minutes] The evening concluded with Elliott Carter's 1981 song-cycle In Sleep, in Thunder, which even in a superlative performance like this (the intrepid soloist was Jon Garrison) strikes me as one of his toughest pieces to digest. Six Robert Lowell poems are set to angular, high-flying vocal lines, no less vehement than the ensemble with its minatory trumpet. The idea must be to make the dramatic implications of the verse explicit - dark, troubled, bitter; as word-setting, however, it seems a long way off Lowell's quietly tense style. In between we had Robin Holloway's gentle Evening with Angels (1972), and a characteristic idyll by Takemitsu. His 1988 Tree Line evinces all the qualities which have kept him laden with commissions from people wanting listener-friendly 'new' music: tranquil and pretty, with its delicate sound-palette, in an idiom just a step beyond early Impressionist Roussel or Florent Schmitt. A new piece by the emigre Dmitri Smirnov, The River of Life sounded equally sincere and out-of-its-time. Here, though, the harking-back was to Skryabin: not to his exacerbated harmony, but to his tremulous ecstasies. As the vision developed, a soulful trumpet sealed the resemblance. Skryabin himself, however, might have stopped short of putting harp, celesta and glockenspiel in unison to make his celestial effects.</p>

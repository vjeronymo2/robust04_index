Lobo] </F>   [Excerpts] President Ramos granted amnesty yesterday to  1,080 rebel returnees on recommendation of the National  Reconciliation and Development Council (NRDC) to enable the  former rebels to rejoin society and lead normal lives.    Interior and Local Government Secretary Rafael Alunan III,  also NRDC chairman, said that the 1,080 rebel returnees were the  first of 4,000 applicants to be given presidential amnesty.  [passage omitted]    The grant of amnesty to the rebel returnees was made  pursuant  to Proclamation 10 and 10A which allow amnesty to those whose  applications were filed, processed or were undergoing processing  before 31 December 1992. [passage omitted]    In his regular press conference yesterday, Ramos also said  that concerned agencies have been alerted on the threat of the  Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB) to punish some government, police,  and military officials and persons whom they tagged as involved  in illegal drugs, illegal gambling, prostitution, and graft and  corruption.    In a press conference last week, a spokesman of the Alex  Boncayao Brigade released a list of 345 persons, including  police and military generals and businessmen, whom they accused  of various criminal and immoral activities and were asked to  "reform." [passage omitted]    "We alerted the PNP [Philippine National Police], DILG  [Department of Interior and Local Government], and the DOJ  [Department of Justice] to look into this," Ramos said.    Ramos added that the threats may have "some intended  propaganda effects but just the same, we are looking at it very  seriously."    At the same time, the president said that the government  will  continue to run after criminal elements in the country. [passage  omitted]</p>

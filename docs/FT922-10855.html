			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / UK Company News: SmithKline Beecham expands in Germany SMITHKLINE Beecham has bought a former East German vaccine company from Treuhandanstalt, the German privatisation agency, in a move which takes the UK-based pharmaceutical group into the manufacture of influenza vaccines for the first time and strengthens its position in central Europe. The purchase of Sachsisches Serumwerke (SSW) by SmithKline Beecham Biologicals gives it control over the largest producer of influenza vaccines in Germany with 1991 sales of about Dm30m (Pounds 10.2m). It takes over a workforce of 200 at the company's Dresden factory and has guaranteed to invest about Dm10m over the next five years to develop the site into a manufacturing site with full European regulatory approvals. Robert Fleming, the merchant bank which advised Treuhandanstalt on the sale, said the acquisition marked the first foreign purchase of an East German pharmaceutical company. Only some 350 of the more than 5,000 former East German companies privatised by Treuhand have been sold to foreign concerns. In this case the UK-based company outbid Behring Werke, a subsidiary of Hoechst of Germany, and Ivax, an associate of the North American Vaccine Company. Purchase of the German company offered SB both a new product line and manufacturing and marketing access to the German and central European markets. Mr Jan Leschly, chairman of Worldwide Pharmaceuticals at SB said 'SmithKline Beecham Biologicals is one of the few worldwide vaccine producers which has no existing flu manufacturing facilities. 'This investment in SSW therefore represents excellent commercial logic and an important addition to our portfolio of vaccine products in Europe.'</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "ACIR Radio News" newscast] </F>   [Text] [Announcer] Today's most important political news  comes to us from the venue for a meeting of the Democratic  Revolutionary Party's [PRD] National Executive Committee.  Developments in the past few days, in which National Executive  Committee members have questioned the actions of PRD President  Porfirio Munoz Ledo and accused him of violating party statutes,  prompted the urgent meeting. It was called on such short notice  that Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, PRD presidential candidate, had to  interrupt his political campaign to meet with the PRD's National  Executive Committee in an attempt to reach an agreement. The  PRD parliamentary subcoordinator has acknowledged that formulas  and mechanisms for PRD unity are urgently needed.    Maria Elena Martinez de la Vega is staying abreast of  developments. Maria Elena, good afternoon. How are you? We  have heard that because they were being hounded by newsmen, the  PRD's National Executive Committee decided to change the venue  for its meeting, which is being held behind closed doors. How  are you?    [Martinez] Fine. In fact, the meeting has been quite  closely held, Pepe. The PRD's National Executive Committee is  meeting at the home of Efigenia Martinez. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,  Porfirio Munoz Ledo, Mario Salcedo, Lucas de la Garza, Jesus  Ortega, and Ramon Sosa Montes have arrived -- in short, all the  members of the PRD's National Executive Committee. They began  arriving at approximately 1700 this afternoon. We do not know  how long the meeting will last. Gilberto Rincon Gallardo told us  they will try to smooth out the differences between various  currents within the PRD so as to restore the party's  institutionality. Thus far, no PRD member who has arrived at  Efigenia's home has made a statement. We hope that when they do  come out, they will have overcome their differences and we may  be able to speak to a member of the PRD.    [Announcer] Maria Elena, this afternoon you gave us an  advance report on what was happening within the PRD. You spoke  to the PRD's parliamentary subcoordinator. He acknowledged it  was urgent that PRD members find formulas and mechanisms for  achieving badly-needed unity, especially at this difficult time  in the electoral process.    [Martinez] Yes, those were the words of Gilberto Rincon  Gallardo, who as you noted is the PRD's parliamentary  subcoordinator. He said the various currents within the PRD  must realize that formulas and mechanisms for achieving PRD  unity and ending internal party conflicts must be urgently  sought. We interviewed him today at PRD national headquarters.  We were there since 1100 this morning, awaiting the outcome of  the National Executive Committee meeting. Rincon Gallardo said  the various party currents must unite and restore the party's  institutionality. He also said they can reach this agreement and  that it is urgent that this process get under way.    Pepe, as soon as any member of the PRD emerges, we will talk  to him and report back to you.    [Announcer] Yes, of course, we will stay in touch with you  on  this topic of so much interest. Thank you, Maria Elena.</p>

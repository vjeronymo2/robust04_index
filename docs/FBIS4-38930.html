			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Privatization Also Envisages the </F> Conversion of Large Enterprises to Joint-Stock Operation"]    [Text] "It is expected that about 5 billion manat will  enter the republic budget during the course of 1994 following  adoption of the law on privatization and its implementation in  the sphere of trade and consumer facilities and incomplete  construction projects," stated Fikret Yusifov, acting minister  of finance of Azerbaijan, in an interview with a correspondent  of the KHABAR-SERVIS agency. Yusifov noted that the program in  question provided for the conversion to joint-stock operation of  large industrial facilities as well. The Ministry of Finance  chief emphasized that he considers it necessary to privatize any  unprofitable enterprise in any sector of industry, with the  exception of those the state must control. To the question as  to whether or not the major oil refineries of Baku were on the  list of enterprises subject to privatization, F. Yusifov  responded negatively, but added that it was entirely possible to  do so. He also explained that the future law would permit  changing the production structure of facilities converted to  joint-stock operation, and that no obstacles to this were  envisaged.</p>

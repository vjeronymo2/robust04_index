			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Letter (1): Diesel not least polluting Sir, The balance that John Griffiths strikes ('Technology: diesel cleans up its act' January 21) between diesel and petrol on their 'cleanness' is slightly misleading. Diesel is cleaner in some respects than present petrol-driven engines, but much of this advantage disappears from the end of this year, when all new petrol-driven cars will be fitted with 3-way catalysts, reducing exhaust emissions by more than 90 per cent. Diesels emit 'particulates' - a fine dust, mostly carbon, which can sometimes be seen as a smoke. This happens even when the engine is well-tuned. Diesels also produce a high level of nitrous oxides. The technology to handle these diesel emissions is progressing but so far is not nearly as well developed as that for petrol exhausts. Conventional wisdom on diesels is that they emit much less carbon dioxide than petrol engines because they are more fuel-efficient and give better mileage. But diesel contains more carbon per litre than petrol does, and so produces more carbon dioxide when it is burned in a car's engine. This offsets much of the reduction in carbon dioxide arising from the better mileage. David Parker, director general, UK Petroleum Industry Association, 9 Kingsway, London WC2</p>

Mr. Zvili emphasized the Israeli authorities are  doing everything to prevent an exacerbation of the situation,  and that the only way to break out of the circle of violence is  to concentrate all efforts in order to facilitate the peace  process.    Our party affairs correspondent Shmu'el Tal reports  opposition leaders will convene this evening to consolidate  positions in view of the possibility that the government will  take advantage of the situation in order to facilitate the peace  process.</p>

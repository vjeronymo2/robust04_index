			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Gulf Canada quits CDollars 5bn oil deal GULF Canada Resources, controlled by property group Olympia &amp; York Developments, is pulling out of a consortium developing the Hibernia oil and gas field off the coast of Newfoundland. Gulf said the initiative to withdraw from the CDollars 5.2bn (USDollars 4.48bn) project came from the company's management and not from O&amp;Y, whose own resources have recently been strained by the slump in the international property market. O&amp;Y, owned by Toronto's Reichmann family, has indicated, however, that its highest priority for the moment is its real estate business. It has been reducing its exposure to the resource sector. Gulf has a 25 per cent interest in the Hibernia project, which is due to come on stream in 1996 with an initial production of 110,000 barrels of oil a day. The company said it was reluctant to commit a large chunk of its resources to a single project which would not contribute any cash flow for at least the next six years. It said it has failed to find a buyer for its stake, and there was no mechanism for a partial withdrawal. The decision will result in an after-tax charge of between CDollars 90m and CDollars 300m. The Canadian and Newfoundland governments, as well as the three other members of the consortium, have insisted that the Hibernia venture will still go ahead. The two governments are providing generous financial incentives for the project, on which Newfoundland is pinning much of its hopes of economic growth in the 1990s. The other members of the consortium are Mobil Oil Canada, Chevron Canada Resources and Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada has also indicated that it would like to reduce its commitment.</p>

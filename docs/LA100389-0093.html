			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOCKHEED FACES $35-MILLION LOSS IN THIRD QUARTER;  </P> <P> FIRM TO WRITE OFF SEVERAL OF ITS MAJOR FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS  </P> <P> Lockheed disclosed Monday that it will take a $165-million writeoff against  several major defense programs, resulting in a $35-million net loss in its  third quarter and depressing further its already weak earnings this year.  </P> <P> The charge could increase the volatility of the situation involving Dallas  investor Harold C. Simmons, who has acquired 10.4% of Lockheed shares over the  past year. Simmons has said he may decide to seek control of the aerospace  firm, though he has disclosed no plans to do so.  </P> <P> It appeared that Lockheed had decided to take the writeoffs against many of its  ailing fixed-price contracts at once, following an internal review that was  completed recently.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Programs Involved  </P> <P> Lockheed is just the latest aerospace firm to be hit by multimillion-dollar  writeoffs on controversial contracts in which a company agrees to design and  develop a weapon for a fixed amount of money, rather than receiving funding  that covers all of its costs. Although the Pentagon has attempted to phase out  fixed-price contracts, dozens remain in the contracting pipeline and have  saddled the industry with hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.  </P> <P> "Lockheed does not intend to pursue any future fixed-priced development  contracts," Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep said in a statement. He said the  $165-million writeoff is the result of problems on programs including building  the wings for the C-17 Air Force cargo jet and modifications to the Navy EP-3E  aircraft.  </P> <P> The Calabasas-based aerospace firm also referred to an undisclosed number of  other programs on which the company took writeoffs, some of which are  classified, a spokesman said. However, the bulk of the $165-million total  applied to the C-17 and EP-3E programs.  </P> <P> "This is a big writeoff," Paine Webber defense industry analyst Joseph Campbell  said. "It adds more fuel to what Simmons is doing."  </P> <P> Campbell noted that even without the writeoff, Lockheed earnings would have  been below Wall Street's expectations. According to Campbell's analysis, the  company would have earned $1.21 a share in the third quarter without the  writeoff, while analysts had been expecting $1.35 a share.  </P> <P> Moreover, the magnitude of the writeoff increases the difficulty that many  investors are having in evaluating aerospace stocks, Campbell said. Lockheed  shares have gained 20.6% this year, outpacing those of most aerospace  companies.  </P> <P> The appreciation has resulted from Simmons' buying activities. "People suspect  that Harold Simmons knows something we don't know," Campbell said.  </P> <P> Lockheed won a fixed-price subcontract in May, 1987, to produce the wings for  the C-17 jet, an award worth an estimated $1.3 billion. The work is being done  at Lockheed's Georgia aircraft facility.  </P> <P> A Lockheed statement blamed the C-17 cost overruns, as well as those on the  Navy EP-3E aircraft, on "hundreds of design changes because of continued  development activity by the customers."  </P> <P> McDonnell Douglas is prime contractor for the C-17 and has been attempting to  reduce the weight of the aircraft to meet contract specifications. The  weight-trimming activities, which have also caused major writeoffs at McDonnell  Douglas, have resulted in a large number of engineering change-orders to  subcontractors.  </P> <P> Lockheed said it will "continue to pursue its claims for equitable pricing  adjustments under these contracts," implying that it is seeking to recover a  major portion of the writeoff from McDonnell Douglas through an administrative  procedure.  </P> <P> Lockheed spokesman Robert Slayman added, "We would seriously consider  litigation if we do not reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the claims."  </P> <P> Slayman confirmed that both the C-17 and EP-3E programs are losing money. The  EP-3E is a program to modify a dozen existing Navy P-3 patrol aircraft. The  original contract value was $59.8 million.  </P> <P> Lockheed said it expects to announce third-quarter financial results late next  week.  </P> <P> Tellep said the third-quarter charges take into account all of the firm's major  fixed-price development programs, except the Navy P-7A aircraft program. That  program is so early in its development that the firm is reporting it on a  break-even basis.  </P> <P> In the third quarter of 1988, Lockheed said it earned $123 million, or $2.07  per share, from continuing operations on sales of $2.3 billion.  </P></p>

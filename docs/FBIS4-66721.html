			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Bangalore, March 8. The Department of Space and  Arianespace have signed an agreement for launching the INSAT-2C  and INSAT-2D multipurpose communication satellites being built  by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the second  half of 1995 and 1996.    The agreement was signed by the ISRO Chairman, Prof. U.R.  Rao, and Arianespace Chairman, Mr. Bigot, in Paris on March 4,  according to an ISRO press release issued here this evening.    Arianespace was selected to launch the satellites after a  thorough evaluation of request for proposals received from  various leading commercial launch services in the international  market.    The second generation INSAT satellites were being built by  ISRO. INSAT-2A and INSAT-2B, launched on July 10, 1992, and July  23, 1993, by Arianespace, were working `very satisfactorily' and  providing various services.    The INSAT-2C and INSAT-2D, weighing around 2,100 kg each,  would add to the capacity available for communications. They  would carry 3 KU-band transponders in addition to the C-band,  S-band and extended C-band transponders. The C-transponders will  have increased power levels that will enhance TV coverage  capabilities and business and remote area communication services.    For the first time in the INSAT system, mobile satellite  communication services will also be introduced. Using this  facility, vehicles fitted with suitable equipment could  communicate with their offices or other vehicles while on the  move.    INSAT-2C and 2D will not carry meteorological instruments  and  will have double-sided solar panels providing about 1,600 watts  of electric power to operate the equipment on board the  satellite.</p>

			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Low &amp; Bonar jumps to Pounds 32m - Near-fourfold advance helped by restructuring and new subsidiaries Low &amp; Bonar yesterday announced a near fourfold increase in profits as the packaging and plastics group reaped the benefits of a wide-ranging restructuring and contributions from new subsidiaries. Britain's self-proclaimed market leader in food packaging saw pre-tax profits climb from Pounds 8.1m to Pounds 31.6m in the 12 months to November 30 last year. Although the 1992 figures were distorted by heavy reorganisation costs in North America and the closure of its UK non-wovens business, profits before exceptionals showed a 43 per cent improvement. Mr Jim Leng, chief executive, said the group - which wraps products as diversified as soap and silage - was now in a dominant position as manufacturers consolidated orders with a few key suppliers. 'We've got rid of the bits and pieces which were not central and we now want to grow in our main businesses, particularly in North America and Europe,' he added. Of the group's three core areas, packaging showed the sharpest improvement with a 55.4 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 20m. The division, representing more than half of group profit, was boosted by contributions of Pounds 5.3m from its latest acquisitions: Cereal Packaging, purchased from Kellogg for Pounds 33.5m, and designer CMB Carton Systems, the packaging equipment company acquired for Pounds 17.4m. The acquisitions - funded by a Pounds 50.2m rights issue last April - contributed Pounds 36m to group turnover of Pounds 368.9m (Pounds 307.3m). Sales of specialist materials improved by 15 per cent to Pounds 82.8m, with profits ahead 35 per cent at Pounds 13m (Pounds 9.6m). The input, however, of the plastics division was more modest. Turnover increased 6.5 per cent to Pounds 52.8m, while profits rose 4.5 per cent to Pounds 4.84m. Mr Norman McLeod, finance director, said the division had failed to keep pace with the other sectors because of the recession in continental Europe, where profits fell to Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 3.8m). 'Nevertheless, we still managed to generate Pounds 25m in cash during the year and brought gearing down to 8 per cent from 30 per cent,' he added. Earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 21.77p, compared with 16.56p before exceptionals in 1992. A proposed final dividend of 7.1p lifts the total to 10p, a 10 per cent increase. COMMENT Low &amp; Bonar has begun to make its assets sweat. Having introduced new management and completed disposals in the UK and North America, it has improved productivity sharply and cut borrowing. A five-year contract with Kellogg has also insulated it from the worst effects of supermarket price cuts. With orders stabilising in Europe and only a 25 per cent exposure to the consumer packaging business, profits are expected to exceed Pounds 39m this year on a forward earnings multiple of 16. The shares, up 7p at 407p yesterday, appear inexpensive.</p>

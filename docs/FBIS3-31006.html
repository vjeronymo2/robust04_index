			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic by an </F> unidentified reporter; place and date not given: "Just Like  Before the Gulf War"]    [Text] [DER SPIEGEL] Does the NATO threat against the  Serbs give the Muslims new courage?    [Ganic] If the Serbs have not withdrawn their artillery by  21 February, NATO must bomb them. Otherwise, there will no  longer be any NATO. The decision is clear: The ultimatum will  not be extended, the only alternatives are withdrawal or attack.    [DER SPIEGEL] The order to the planes to attack must still  be given by UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali.    [Ganic] NATO has imposed the ultimatum so as to act and not  to wriggle out of its responsibility again with administrative  excuses. Formally, Butrus-Ghali decides on the operation -- in  reality, Clinton and Mitterrand give the orders.    [DER SPIEGEL] Are the attacks designed to give the  inhabitants of Sarajevo some breathing space, or is the  intention to end the war in Bosnia, if necessary by militarily  defeating the Serbs?    [Ganic] A soon as Sarajevo is liberated, the Serbs will  immediately show readiness for compromise. The psychological  effect will be thorough.    [DER SPIEGEL] However, the Serbs could give up Sarajevo and,  in retaliation, destroy Tuzla, Gorazde, or other Bosnian towns.    [Ganic] They will do this only if NATO hesitates and once  again demonstrates leniency. So far, throughout this war, the  West has not yet done anything specific. However, the Serbs  cannot be impressed with appeals and resolutions.    [DER SPIEGEL] Serbian leader Karadzic does not seem to be  very intimidated. He is threatening retaliatory strikes.    [Ganic] This is simply ridiculous. The Serbs are only a  small regional power, but before any potential intervention  there are Western critics who conjure up the danger of a world  war -- this is the same situation as before the Gulf war against  Iraq. The UN blue helmets in Bosnia spend 90 percent of their  time barricading and entrenching themselves, even though the  Serbs are cowards, are strong only with artillery. There is no  reason to fear them.    [DER SPIEGEL] Can Serbian superiority be broken without the  use of ground forces?    [Ganic] I guarantee that Milosevic will not wage war against  NATO. He will never risk the bombing of Serbia. He will also  call his puppets in Bosnia, such as Karadzic, back in time.    [DER SPIEGEL] Does a NATO intervention bring peace closer,  or does it just lengthen the war? Hoping for Western help, your  President Izetbegovic has so far rejected any compromise at the  negotiating table in Geneva.    [Ganic] Why should we share our house with thieves? We do  not have the authority to relinquish any land to the Serbs. It  is the property of our people, who have been driven away. Are  our fellow-citizens supposed to vegetate as refugees in Germany  or Austria instead of returning to their homes? According to  the ethnic map, 45 percent of Bosnia belongs to the Muslim  population.    [DER SPIEGEL] In Geneva you are offered about one-third of  the state territory. Are you not succumbing to an illusion if  you hope to receive more?    [Ganic] Germany has been united, Israel is negotiating with  the Palestinians about the return of the occupied territories.  Peace without clearing out of conquered territories is  inconceivable. If the Serbs do not withdraw, there will be  chaos in Bosnia for a long time. Europe is constantly calling  on us to end the war and does not understand that our giving in  would just end the first stage of the war. If Bosnia is divided  into three parts, the Serbian Republic will continue to attack  the Bosnian Republic.    [DER SPIEGEL] Can you actually survive as a nation in the  Serbian-Croatian embrace? What kind of Bosnia do you want to  push through at the Geneva negotiations?    [Ganic] A sovereign state, which may be structured in  autonomous areas, but with a central parliament and a central  government.    [DER SPIEGEL] Your government had already agreed on the  principle of a tripartite division....    [Ganic] ...the temptation to resign oneself to a small piece  of land, if this could ensure that one never had to see Chetniks  again, naturally existed. However, now we have to strengthen  our resistance so as to decisively weaken the Serbs.    [DER SPIEGEL] What happens if the ultimatum passes and the  Serbs only pretend to give in just to attack with all the more  force a few weeks later?    [Ganic] If NATO gambles away its opportunity, the war will  spread. We will begin a guerrilla war and stake everything on  one card. Perhaps the Turkish Army will then help us. The  Islamic countries have frequently offered us their support.</p>

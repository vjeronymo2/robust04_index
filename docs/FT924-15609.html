			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Gibs look rocky THE RATES on offer for guaranteed income bonds (Gibs) show just how confused people have been, writes John Authers. On September 16 - Black Wednesday - one company, American Life, even assumed that base rates were going to stay at 12 per cent and raised rates. This led to the strange pattern shown in the accompanying graph for September, compiled by Baronworth Investment Services. The actuaries who control the rates on offer from Gibs took a while to get over their confusion. The graph shows only the best rates on offer. Some firms offered much less. At the beginning of this week it was possible to get 7 per cent, guaranteed over one year, but the worst rate was only 5.1. Over five years, the gap is from 8 to 6.8 per cent. On Black Wednesday, one-year rates varied from 9.3 to 6.15 per cent. So, perhaps the most important lesson from the past fortnight is that if you want to buy a Gib, you should do so only through an independent adviser who can pick the best rate. The reliance of Gibs on short-dated bond yields is such, however, that an adviser should probably not sell you one at all. Most are based on low-risk corporate bonds or fixed term building society bonds, with sizeable holdings in short-dated gilts. They are encouragingly simple products which guarantee you either an annual income, with capital returned at the end of the period, or a guaranteed annual level of growth. Basic-rate tax is paid by the fund; you will be liable to pay more if you are a top-rate taxpayer. This level of security is very attractive. But the rates on offer, particularly with many marketeers predicting that inflation will return, are not good enough. The best rates over one year are 6 per cent for Pounds 1,000 and 7 per cent for Pounds 50,000. Over five years, these rise to 7.5 and 8 per cent. National Savings' index-linked certificates still guarantee to beat inflation by 4.5 per cent over five years. That means they will beat Gibs if inflation over the next five years averages more than 3.5 per cent. And long bond yields show that marketeers expect inflation to be worse than this. James Higgins, of Chamberlain De Broe, says: 'Before anyone buys the five-year Gibs, they should make sure that they hold the full allowance of 5th issue index-linked certificates.'</p>

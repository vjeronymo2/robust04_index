			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ashraf al-Faqiyy: "Libya: The United States </F> Will Not Succeed in Imposing Oil Sanctions"]    [Text] Cairo -- In a statement to AL-HAYAH in Cairo, a  Libyan official criticized the "U.S. Administration's threat to  escalate the sanctions against his country to include oil  exports." He ruled out "the possibility of a Security Council  resolution to that effect because the interests of several  Security Council member states are linked to Libyan oil."    He pointed out that "the U.S. insistence on esclation could  shut the door in the face of the attempts to resolve the  Lockerbie crisis." He stressed that closing the door to a  solution "would never change Libya's position or make it forfeit  its sovereignty and break its laws." He said that "the Libyan  people can live without the oil."    'Izz-al-Din al-Hinshiri, Libyan secretary of the General  People's Committee for Communications (communications minister),  left Cairo yesterday for his country via Tunisia after a visit  to Egypt lasting several days.    Early in the week, he survived a road accident on his way  from Libya to Cairo in the al-Dab'ah area near al-'Alamayn.</p>

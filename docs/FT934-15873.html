			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Israel will free most Intifada prisoners ISRAEL is ready to free almost all of the more than 10,000 Palestinian detainees it is holding for Intifada related offences, as a confidence building measure in the run-up to the start of Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and Jericho next spring, writes David Horovitz in Jerusalem. A plan for the release of the detainees was presented yesterday to Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime minister, by army chiefs. Final details of the prisoner release are to be hammered out at talks between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators beginning next Wednesday. Mr Rabin confirmed on television last night that 'prisoners will be freed' but he declined to give details. However, a source close to him said the plan provided for the freeing of most Intifada offenders, but the transfer of several hundred top security prisoners - 'those with blood on their hands' - from West Bank and Gaza jails to prisons inside sovereign Israel. The army also detailed its proposals for ensuring the safety of Jewish settlers, for co-operation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces, and for the construction of various bypass roads to ensure secure travel for Jews in the territories.</p>

			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EDUCATION;  </P> <P> FULBRIGHTS ON SINO-U.S. AGENDA  </P> <P> China and the United States said today they have opened talks on resuming the  Fulbright scholar exchange program, a victim of the chill in relations after  China's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.  </P> <P> China's State Education Commission and the U.S. Embassy said their  representatives met for the first time last week -- just days after U.S.  National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft's fence-mending visit to Beijing.  </P> <P> Neither side linked the talks to Scowcroft's visit, but embassy spokesman Ed  Loo acknowledged, "There wasn't much going on before."  </P> <P> He said the United States had been seeking a renewal of the  government-sponsored Fulbright program "for some time."  </P> <P> China announced this fall that it was halting the program for a year.  </P></p>

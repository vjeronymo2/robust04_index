Bogdanov, deputy commander for </F> Rear, chief of Fleet Rear of Black Sea Fleet, under rubric "Army  and Navy Rear": "A Special Fleet in a Special Period"]    [Text] The Black Sea Fleet performs missions in its  operational zone as a component part of the Russian Federation  Navy. The missions are responsible and important and are aimed  at achieving peace, tranquility and stability of the political  situation in the given region.    Keeping Fleet forces in constant readiness and success of  performing combat missions largely depend on the status of  logistic and technical support systems, i.e., they are  determined by the capacities and capability of these systems to  bring permanent readiness forces up to full allowances of arms,  ammunition, fuel and other supplies in a short time and carry  out mobilization and deployment of Fleet forces in the logistic  sense.    What are the features of functioning of the Black Sea Fleet  logistic support system today? Above all it is the Black Sea  Fleet's simultaneous operational subordination to two  Presidents--of Russia and Ukraine. Fleet rear units and  establishments are on the territory of two sovereign states,  experiencing the painful process of reorganization of the  economic base of CIS states and all complexities of the  transition of their economy to market relations and of the break  in economic ties. Financial resources for military expenditures  have been reduced considerably and centralized deliveries of  supplies have stopped. Regional conflicts (Georgia, Moldova,  Abkhazia) have affected us directly.    Despite all difficulties and problems, the alignment,  composition and manning of the Fleet rear, the availability of  supplies and their echelonment as a whole for 1992-1993  permitted supporting Fleet forces with everything necessary and  getting prescribed standards of allowances to each seaman,  warrant officer and officer. Along with performing missions  inherent to it, the Fleet rear has performed much work to  fulfill Russian government assignments. An operation was carried  out to evacuate servicemen's families and the civilian  population from Abkhazia, Poti and Batumi. A total of around  50,000 persons were evacuated. Tens of thousands of tonnes of  stockpiles were evacuated from the territory of Georgia and a  peacemaking mission of Black Sea Fleet ships and naval infantry  to the city of Poti was successfully supported to protect lines  of transportation.    The operation of all rear elements was and is continuing to  be carried out in an extremely unstable political and economic  situation in the Crimea and Ukraine. The absence of a precise  legal status of the Black Sea Fleet and of course of a  legislative and legal base both for the Fleet as a whole as well  as for the personnel and for servicemen's families is having an  especially negative effect on the activity of rear entities.  Together with Ukraine's discriminatory laws and with the  constant ideological pressure on Fleet personnel and their  families, the inaction of Russian Federation laws "On Defense,"  On the Status of Servicemen," "On Military Obligation and  Military Service" and "On Pension Support to Persons Who Have  Performed Military Service...," especially with respect to  provisions on social protection and benefits and against the  background of old social problems which remained, engenders a  feeling of uncertainty about tomorrow and apathy in many.    And the duality of Black Sea Fleet operational subordination  is causing serious problems and difficulties in timely, complete  support of Fleet ships and units with supplies. The chief  problem is that the procedure for financing and supplying the  Fleet has not been worked out or defined up to the present time.  The Yalta agreements between Ukraine and Russia are being  violated unilaterally by Ukraine and are leading to disruption  of centralized deliveries of supplies coming from Russia.    Thus, new Ukrainian customs rules placed in force as of 1  April 1993 provide for a 0.15 percent customs duty on military  cargoes; financial resources have not been allocated for these  needs. Ukraine is taking enormous funds from the Fleet in the  form of a tax on land (13 billion karbovantsy for 1993), which  is leading to actual disruption of Black Sea Fleet financing.  Officers and warrant officers arriving from Russia for duty in  the Black Sea Fleet pay 300,000 karbovantsy each, i.e., almost  one month's pay, for customs inspection of containers of  household goods. Ten dollars, or this amount in karbovantsy at  the bank rate of exchange, is collected for each flight of  aircraft from the territory of Russia to the Black Sea Fleet.  Five dollars is collected for each customs worker arriving to  inspect the aircraft, and it is based on double rates if this  occurs on days off or holidays.    Pay for Fleet servicemen in karbovantsy is much below the  financial support to Russian Armed Forces servicemen in real  buying power. Compare. The pay of a Black Sea Fleet officer is  $15-20 according to the local rate of exchange. Benefits  envisaged for a serviceman by Russian laws are not being applied  in the Black Sea Fleet up to the present time. The Fleet has a  colossal debt for fuel, food, electrical energy and water. Power  and water supply agencies disconnect garrisons and housing areas  where thousands of people live for systematic nonpayment of  accounts. All the above leads to a strained social situation in  the Fleet.    The established 50-percent support of the Fleet in equal  proportions by Russia and Ukraine is not being upheld. The main  reserves of supplies come basically from Russia. Thus, while 81  percent of fuel oil, 88 percent of diesel fuel, 75 percent of  aviation kerosene, and 67 percent of clothing and related gear  were supplied from Russia in 1992, 100 percent of fuel oil,  diesel fuel, clothing and related gear, and equipment came from  Russia in 1993. In August of last year Ukraine unilaterally  stopped all financial support of the Black Sea Fleet. The Fleet  rear is supported only by Russia, which once again confirms that  only an economically highly developed state is capable of  maintaining and supporting the Navy and keeping its combat  readiness at a sufficient level.    The reduction in the Armed Forces, reorganization of the  country's economic base, and the need for increasing the  effectiveness of work by rear units and establishments in the  course of military reform dictate the advisability of  accelerating a transition to a system of supporting Black Sea  Fleet forces on a territorial principle. The main content of  this principle must be an increase in responsibility and  effectiveness of using rear units and establishments existing in  peacetime for autonomous, reliable support of Fleet forces by  making fixed bases, depots, and transportation, repair and other  rear establishments into primary ones and investing them with  additional rights and obligations.    The essence of the territorial principle of logistic support  of Fleet forces is that a rear grouping deployed in a designated  basing area supports all ships, units and formations performing  missions in or near the given area, i.e., they are assigned to  the corresponding rear grouping for support. The territorial  (zonal) support system permits concentrating all Fleet forces  and assets and all resources, maneuvering them flexibly and  using them effectively in full accordance with the  operational-rear situation.    Fleet rear departments, on whose basis we propose to  establish Fleet logistic and technical support areas without  increasing the numerical strength of the management apparatus,  are the basis of the territorial system of Black Sea Fleet  logistic support. In peacetime this will permit reducing the  time periods for delivering supplies to consumers, organizing  centralized supply, simplifying the system of records and  accounts, increasing effectiveness of control over support to  Fleet forces, and also using the local economic base most  advisably. Most important, the alignment of the peacetime rear  will correspond to the operational alignment of Fleet forces in  the initial period of war.    And in wartime this will enable distributing and sheltering  supplies promptly, increasing the survivability and autonomy of  the system of logistic support to Fleet forces, improving the  effectiveness of command and control of the rear and, of course,  ensuring stability of the system of logistic support to Fleet  forces because of the fixed base.    Subordinating the management entities performing logistic,  technical, transportation, medical and basing support functions  to one official must be the basic principle of operational  development of the Navy rear. It is necessary to observe the  unity of administrative and functional subordination. With  consideration of this principle, in my view it is necessary to  concentrate forces and assets in the makeup of rear management  entities in fleets, naval bases and formations to perform tasks  of providing all kinds of supplies; repairing ships, weapons,  arms and equipment; providing basing and medical and other kinds  of logistic support; and providing means of transportation for  military movements and delivery of supplies.    The history of Navy development shows that the rear was  centralized and unified for a lengthy period of many centuries.  History itself moves us to conclude the presence of a stable  trend, tested by war experience and peacetime combat training,  toward development and perfection of a centralized, unified rear  in the center and in the fleets, and a unified fleet logistic  and technical support system.    Wherein does the positiveness of a unified fleet rear  structure lie? First of all, under a unified command element the  rear accomplishes a mutually coordinated, comprehensive, and  complete integrated support of fleet forces in all zones and  areas of support, which contributes to more effective and  precise use of forces and assets.    Secondly, it meets requirements for centralized delivery of  supplies, permitting performance of assigned missions with a  lesser detail of forces and assets.    Thirdly, it permits increasing, in a logistic sense, the  autonomy of combat force groupings by creating integrated,  autonomous support subsystems in individual areas and on  specific axes, which creates favorable conditions for  performance of support missions by available peacetime forces  and assets with the sudden beginning of combat operations.    The division of the rear which occurred in 1989 and the  removal from its makeup of organs of technical and engineer  support, medical service, military transportation service and  armored service created difficulties in planning and  accomplishing logistic support to forces, especially with the  establishment of rear groupings for integrated support. Alas,  planning and implementation of these plans were under the  purview of two entities subordinate to each other. In essence,  the unified system of integrated logistic and technical support  was disrupted. The division of the rear occurred only at the  fleet level; the organizational structure of formations and  units did not undergo changes. As a result, the principle of  identity of organizational structure at all levels of the fleet  rear was violated.    The breakup of the rear complicated command and control of  logistic support forces and assets in peacetime (especially with  a transfer to a wartime footing). Therefore we propose to  establish a Fleet rear organizational structure in the Black Sea  Fleet that unites logistic, technical and engineer support  forces and assets under a unified command of the Fleet chief of  rear.    Successful functioning of the Fleet logistic support system  is impossible without means of transportation.    The low strength level of basic types of vessels negatively  affects the possibilities of support to Fleet forces in ocean  and forward logistic support zones, at mobile basing facilities,  at supply facilities, and at permanent station facilities of the  Black Sea Fleet main logistic support zone. The auxiliary fleet  has a special need for universal artillery ammunition carriers,  marine dry-cargo carriers, technical tankers, seagoing harbor  tugs, and water carriers. And in the future the construction of  comprehensive and special support ships (vessels) with a fleet  speed of 20-24 knots, of air-cushion transport vehicles (boats)  with a speed of 80-100 knots and hydrofoils with a speed of  50-60 knots is needed. This will allow increasing the  operational use factor of vessels and lowering the need for them  by 1.5-2 times, i.e., reducing the need for vessels and  realizing the principle of preferential use of the floating rear  in supporting ship groupings by increasing quality parameters.    An extremely serious situation has taken shape with  auxiliary  fleet ship repair. Today vessels are being operated with expired  periods between repairs and periods between drydockings. The  actual percentage of ship repair support in 1992 was 30. Because  of the absence of financing, the question of accommodating  vessels for repair has not been resolved up to the present time.    With the present nature of warfare, the effectiveness of all  kinds of operations and combat operations of naval forces  depends to an even greater degree on reliability of their  logistic support. An analysis shows that the volume of logistic  support in modern operations is growing by approximately 10-15  times compared with the Great Patriotic War period. In  conducting combat operations it is necessary to replenish  supplies, above all of weapons and fuel.    The existing system of storing supplies in the Fleet shows  that norms in force for dispersal and echelonment of unit-level  operational supplies are not being sustained.    A high concentration of supplies in categorized cities with  a  low degree of their shelter in protected structures can lead to  great losses in the very first days of war, since dispersing  considerable volumes of weapons and supplies in short time  periods is a very complicated task. The basic cause of the  unfavorable state of affairs with dispersal and shelter of  supplies is the poor state of Fleet support with depot spaces  and fuel tanks. This means the status of the material-technical  base for storing supplies in the Fleet does not conform to rates  of development of Fleet needs, which in turn is determined by  the absence of necessary funds for construction materials and  poor capabilities of Fleet construction organizations.    A serious situation has formed with echelonment of supplies  in the first echelon--on ships and in units and formations. The  lowering of reserves in the troop rear due to a shortage or  absence of depot spaces not only affects the combat readiness of  unit and formations, but also in the final account leads to a  disruption of the entire system of echeloning supplies in the  Fleet and to an overloading of Fleet depots and fuel bases with  unit-level supplies to the detriment of their containing  operational-level supplies.    The lag of the material-technical base behind the  quantitative and qualitative development of Fleet combat forces  is a stable trend in the Black Sea Fleet, which is showing up  especially at the present time. While in their development based  on the newest achievements of science and technology, combat  forces are at the level of the 1990's for many qualitative  parameters, the material-technical base is at the level (yes,  yes!) of the 1960's and 1970's. This relates above all to the  basing system, to the ship and vessel repair and drydocking  base, and to the presence and status of storage areas and tanks  for keeping weapons, ammunition, equipment, fuel, provisions and  other supplies. As a result of the insufficient capacity of the  material-technical base, ship and vessel repair and drydocking  time periods increase. The incomplete state of support involving  storage areas and tanks does not permit keeping stockpiles in  necessary amounts and leads to their losses and to a decrease in  survivability of reserves.    The principal direction for solving this problem is the  elimination of disproportions between the development of Fleet  combat forces and development of the material-technical base.  Development of the rear should be constantly balanced with  consideration of quantitative and qualitative changes in the  order of battle of Fleet forces and in its combat assets, arms  and equipment. These changes should occur simultaneously and  even with a certain lead time for entry into the Fleet of rear  equipment needed for supporting new ships and for preparing and  delivering weapons and other supplies. Realization of this  direction can be achieved only by increasing the funds for  development of the material base at the expense of a  quantitative and qualitative reduction in the construction of  new ships and by excluding obsolete ones from the Fleet makeup.    In my view, it is advisable to bring the material-technical  base into line with needs for supporting forces along the  following directions:     -  ensuring a proportional ratio between combat forces and  their supporting forces (assets). Under conditions of a  reduction in numerical strength of the Armed Forces, this ratio  should be changed in the interests of the rear already in  peacetime. In developing a long-range program for Navy  development it is advisable to develop and provide for a ratio  of 1.0-0.8 between combat forces and the rear;    -  achieving an outstripping development of rear equipment and  armament, i.e., it is advisable to apply the principle that new  rear equipment should be created and enter the Fleet before new  ships and aircraft are included in the order of battle;    -  a balanced development of the shore (fixed and mobile),  floating (surface, underwater and amphibious) and airmobile  rear;    -  creating technical equipment on ships (vessels, transports)  that supports mass, rapid transfer of cargoes from vessels  (transports) to ships, and also the loading and unloading of  vessels off an austere beach.        An improvement in the rear management system is impossible  without accelerated establishment of an automated system for  managing the Navy rear; without modelling logistic support  processes using modern operations research methods permitting  choice of the optimum option based on an evaluation of  alternative options of decisions and logistic support plans; and  without introducing methods of military and economic  substantiation and forecasting of the directions of rear  development and methods of a military and economic evaluation of  rear operational and combat training measures. Realization of  the main directions for development of the Fleet rear in  peacetime will help attain stable logistic support of Fleet  forces.    The Fleet rear has considerable plans. Would that energy,  knowledge and persistence were enough. We must create a highly  developed territorial system of support for the Black Sea Fleet  meeting the defensive nature of military doctrine and the  adopted structure of the national economy, ensuring effective  satisfaction with everything necessary for life, everyday  routine and combat training in peacetime and contributing to the  buildup of the rear's forces and assets in a short time when it  is mobilized and placed in full combat readiness.

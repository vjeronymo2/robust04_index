A Karenni spokesman who requested anonymity said four  battalions of the Burmese Army -- the 421th, 250th, 261st light  infantry battalions, and 102nd ordinary battalion -- launched a  lightning attack against about 100 Karenni fighters around  midnight on 26 January near Danai Khong San village, which is  about 10 miles north of Loikaw, the capital of the Karenni state.    Four Burmese troops were killed and three others wounded;  the  Karenni lost arms and ammunition during the one-night assault,  but suffered no casualties, he said.    The spokesman expected the ruling State Law and Order  Restoration Council (Slorc) would continue its offensive and  said fighting could last until the onset of the wet season in  April or May.    He said the attack on the Karenni took place 10 days after  the second round of bilateral talks failed to make any progress.    Karenni and Slorc representatives met on 12 and 16 January  about 40 miles from Loikaw. Deputy Army Chief Major Aung Mya  led the three-member Karenni team, which also included Karenni  officials Paulu and Shan Reh, to meet the four-person Burmese  delegation led by Colonel Kyaw Win, deputy director of the  Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence (DDSI), and  Lieutenant Colonel Kyaw Thein, a DDSI officer in charge of peace  negotiations and drugs suppression.    The Karenni spokesman said Slorc rejected their four-point  proposal, while the Karenni could not accept Rangoon's demand  that they drop political claims for independence. The Karenni  proposal calls for Slorc to withdraw its troops from the eastern  side of the Salween River, allowing Karenni forces to move  freely in Karenni State, an end to collecting taxes and  conscripting civilians as porters, and to stop using Karenni  territory as a base to attack other armed ethnic forces.    Despite the breakdown of the talks, the Slorc delegation  told  the meeting that they would meet again in the future, according  to the Karenni spokesman. No date had been fixed.</p>

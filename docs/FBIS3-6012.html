			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 14 KYODO -- Vice Postal Minister  Futoshi Shirai denied Monday U.S. allegations that the Japanese  Government has guaranteed a numerical target in solving a  dispute with the United States over the opening of its cellular  telephone market.    The agreement reached between Nippon Idou Tsushin Corp.  (IDO)  and Motorola Inc. last week called for the Japanese firm to  build 159 new base stations for the U.S. competitor by the fall  of next year.    Shirai said IDO is expected to implement the agreement  without fail. He added, however, that it would be wrong to  construe that the government has guaranteed the numerical target  accepted by IDO.    The government will do whatever it can to see to it that the  agreement is carried out smoothly.    Vice Foreign Minister Kunihiko Saito also told reporters the  Japanese Government will watch implementation of the agreement  within its power. If there is any difference between Japan and  the U.S. in the interpretation of the agreement, it is because  the U.S. Government apparently misunderstood the accord, he said.    He said the government is in no position to intervene in  private-sector affairs though it will keep a watch on the  implementation of the accord.</p>

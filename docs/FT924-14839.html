			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / El Al 'black box' under scrutiny ACCIDENT investigators yesterday recovered the 'black box' flight recorder from the El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet which crashed into two Amsterdam housing blocks on Sunday, killing at least 250 people. Dutch officials at first warned that the flight recorder, which has been flown to the Farnborough Accident Investigation Centre in the UK for decoding, was badly damaged but later Mr Henk Wolleswinkel, the chief crash investigator, said it looked in better shape than initial reports had led him to believe. He said: 'We're really crossing our fingers that we can get some useful information out of it.' He noted, however, that the flight recorder had been battered and exposed to extreme heat. Piecing together the cause of the crash is proving difficult. Search teams have so far not found the separate cockpit voice recorder, which could reveal the last conversations between the pilots. Adding to the investigators' difficulties, only one of the engines has been found in a lake nine miles from the crash site. This has raised the possibility that earlier reports that both starboard engines had broken loose were incorrect. Officials say the two pieces of engine found so far now appear to be two halves of the same Pratt &amp; Whitney engine. There was also no trace of fire.</p>

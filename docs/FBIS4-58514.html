			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Headlines" column by Fahd al-Fanik: "Israeli-Palestinian </F> Customs Union"]    [Text] The economic agreement between Israel and the PLO  signed in Paris on 29 April falls short of the minimum  requirements of the economic cooperation accord between Jordan  and the PLO. The PLO-Israeli agreement amounts to a unilateral  abrogation of the one concluded between Jordan and the PLO.    We may have to await the publication of the full texts and  annexes of the Paris agreement, which are said to be lengthy and  detailed. The salient points as reported by AFP, however, are  sufficient to understand the drift of the agreement.    For some reason or other, the Jordanian Government wants to  assess the agreement in a different light. It may be that it  does not want to strain relations with the PLO or the sponsors  of the agreement. Or it may be that the Jordanian Government  does not want to disrupt the peace process or interfere in the  Palestinian decisionmaking process, even if it is at the expense  of Jordanian interests.    The Jordanian-Palestinian economic cooperation agreement  signed in Amman on 7 January 1994 provides for the Jordanian  dinar to be in circulation in the West Bank and Gaza, along with  other Arab and foreign currencies. The Paris agreement  expressly states the shekel will be legal tender, among other  currencies.    The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement grants Jordan's Central  Bank the right to oversee the banking and monetary systems in  the West Bank and Gaza during the transition period. The  Israeli-Palestinian agreement sanctions the institution of a  local monetary agency to fulfill that role. However, the  proposed Palestinian monetary agency will be controlled by the  Israeli monetary agency.    The Jordanian-Palestinian agreement envisages increased  trade  between Jordan and Palestine. Under the Paris agreement, there  will be a joint customs authority on the West Bank's border with  Jordan and Gaza's border with Egypt, meaning a customs union  administered by Israel and incorporating the West Bank and Gaza.  As a consequence, the Palestinian market will continue to be  captive to Israeli products, and the Palestinian consumers and  investors will continue to be exploited by Israel as they are  now under occupation. The only difference will be that, instead  of the exploitation taking place under the coercion of  occupation, it will now take place with the blessing of the  Palestinian side.    As for some Jordanian products being allowed onto the  Palestinian market, this will be conditional on prior Israeli  approval. Furthermore, only a limited number, with a maximum of  $15 million worth, of unimportant Jordanian goods that Israel  does not produce will be allowed in annually.    In a nutshell, the Paris economic agreement sacrifices  Jordanian and Palestinian interests and confirms the West Bank  and Gaza as adjuncts to the Israeli economy, thus detaching the  Palestinian economy from the Jordanian economy. It is a  unilaterally submissive agreement.</p>

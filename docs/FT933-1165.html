			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Yeltsin calls in troops as deputies face ultimatum: Defiant parliament told to disarm and quit building PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday ordered troops and riot police to circle the Russian parliament in an attempt to break the resolve of deputies who have continued to defy his declaration of presidential rule. Hours after an elite corps of interior ministry troops surrounded the White House, the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies appeared to be cracking under the pressure of an ultimatum of 5am local time today (1am GMT) to hand over weapons and evacuate the building, adjourning its session at about 9pm. However, in an apparent act of continuing defiance, the deputies were scheduled to reconvene today at 10am local time. Within the White House last night the guards who had earlier carried machine guns and automatic pistols were all without weapons. Later Moscow city authorities loyal to Mr Yeltsin cut off electricity to the building. Witnesses said vice-president Alexander Rutskoi, Mr Yeltsin's rival in the power struggle, could be seen stalking the corridors with a candle. Partial power supply was later restored with a reserve generator. Nearby one person was injured when troops in full riot gear used batons to clear anti-government demonstrators obstructing interior ministry trucks. Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a close aide of Mr Yeltsin and first deputy prime minister, said the proceedings in the White House were a 'tragi-comedy . . . it is possible to say that the president has won'. Despite the troop deployment, Mr Yeltsin, speaking at a meeting in Moscow of leaders of the Commonwealth of Independent States, promised there would be no attack on the White House, a pledge echoed by Mr Viktor Yerin, interior minister, whose troops were surrounding it. In a possible indication of Mr Yeltsin's strategy, Mr Shumeiko said deputies would be allowed to leave parliament but not to return. The parliamentary session ended with squabbling over the leadership of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker. Mr Veniamin Sokolov, head of the Council of the Republic, said Mr Khasbulatov's 'potential was exhausted'  -but Gen Rutskoi, named by parliament as acting vice-president, saved him from defeat by saying that 'changing horses in midstream' would make the deputies 'the laughing stock of the world'. As the stand-off between the two power groups continued, attention shifted to the regions where a number of councils have protested against Mr Yeltsin's decree banning the federal parliament and threatened continuing opposition. Mr Aman Tuleyev, leader of the Kuzbass council, claimed that 24 of the 68 councils had defied Mr Yeltsin and would halt oil and gas exports and refuse to pay taxes. Echoing Gen Rutskoi and other parliamentary leaders, Mr Tuleyev called for simultaneous elections of parliament and president on December 11 and 12 - the date set by Mr Yeltsin for elections for the lower house of a new parliament. Mr Yeltsin has insisted on parliamentary elections first, followed by presidential elections next June to avoid a vacuum of power, and also to control the parliamentary process in its early stages. Presidential aides said last night that regions that defied the president's decree to hold elections would be forced to have local elections and would have presidential rule imposed.

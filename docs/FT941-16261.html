			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Management deal secures independence of Epicure Epicure, the 100-year-old grocery brand, will remain part of an independent company following a Pounds 10.5m deal announced yesterday, writes Nigel Clark Petty Wood, the family-owned food distributor which owns the brand, is being bought by its management. Mr Jonathan Russell of 3i, which is backing the deal, said: 'This is a classic case of resolving a succession issue within an old established family business by uniting ownership with management. The company was founded in 1816 and the shares have passed through several generations. In 1989 a new management team came in, since when there has been little family involvement in the day-to-day activities. Finance for the deal, which includes working capital, is provided by a syndicate led by 3i and including Lloyds Development Capital and NatWest Ventures. Mr Peter Hopkins, managing director, said the buy-out would enable the company's expansion programme to continue. 'The sense of family unity has been a great asset to the company in the past but it is now time to move Petty Wood forward.' Over the last three years the company, based in Andover, Hampshire, has expanded to bring in other leading brands as well as Epicure. These include Melitta Coffee, Jordans cereals and Baxters of Speyside. It supplies prestige outlets such as Fortnum &amp; Mason and Harrods as well as independent retailers. Turnover for 1993 is expected to be more than Pounds 20m.</p>

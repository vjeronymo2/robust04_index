			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, April 2 (AFP) -- A first group of around  1,500 Palestinian policemen will be deployed on Thursday [7  April] in Gaza and Jericho where self-rule is to be launched,  the PLO said here Saturday.    The office of Faysal al-Husayni, the PLO mainstream group  Fatah's chief in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said three  battalions of the Palestine Liberation Army (PLA) would "start  their mission immediately" on arrival.    One thousand former PLA fighters drafted in the police force  will arrive in the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border post with  Egypt. The other 500 will arrive in the West Bank town of  Jericho over the Allenby bridge from Jordan.    The office added that a first group of Palestinian exiles  would start to return on Tuesday, signaling "the start of the  return of all the Palestinians expelled since 1967," when Israel  seized the territories.    Israel and the PLO are close to agreeing on the deployment  of  up to 10,000 Palestinian policemen in Gaza and Jericho, chief  PLO negotiator Nabil Sha'th said Saturday.    "An accord on the number of policemen should be concluded  during meetings of the PLO and Israeli security committee" which  begin in Cairo on Sunday, Sha'th said in the Egyptian capital.    The talks would also focus on "preparations for the  deployment" of the police and security arrangements for Jericho  and Gaza.    "I don't think there is currently a problem on the number of  policemen, which will be around 10,000," Sha'th said.    Under a security accord signed in Cairo on Thursday, Israel  and the PLO agreed that 160 foreign observers would be deployed  in the mosque massacre town of Hebron and a first contingent of  Palestinian police would be sent this week.</p>

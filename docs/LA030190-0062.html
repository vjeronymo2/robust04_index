			<p><P> March 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> NUTRITIONALLY SPEAKING: LITTLE TRICKS CAN EASILY HELP MUFFINS MIX IN WITH A  HEALTHY BREAKFAST  </P> <P> As a healthful breakfast item, the muffin has received its share of criticism.  That they are loaded with sugar or are high in saturated fat -- from butter and  oil -- are two such grievances.  </P> <P> But depending upon the recipe, an average muffin made from wholesome  ingredients can contain 200 calories and five grams of fat or less. Combine  this with fresh fruit and a serving of nonfat or low-fat milk and breakfast  rounds out at fewer than 500 calories -- less than one-third of the day's  allotment for a person on an 1,800 calorie per day diet.  </P> <P> Ingredients such as nonfat milk, buttermilk and nonfat or low-fat yogurt can  replace the whole dairy products usually called for in muffin recipes without  ruining the texture of the final product. Whole grain cereal, such as oats, or  wheat and oat brans can stand in nicely for some of the flour called for. Or,  sprinkle wheat germ over the batter or substitute whole-wheat flour for half of  the flour in the recipe. Tricks such as these improve the fiber content of  muffins and up the total fiber for the day.  </P> <P> The saturated fat and cholesterol contributed by eggs can be omitted with  little notice by substituting two egg whites for each whole egg a recipe  requires. This shaves off as much as 200 milligrams of cholesterol and six  grams total fat from the day.  </P> <P> Relying upon the natural sweetness of dried or fresh fruits is a suggestion for  limiting the amount of sugar in muffins. And keeping an eye on cheese, meat and  nuts in savory recipes will also spare calories and fat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DYNAMITE YOGURT MUFFINS  </P> <P> 1 cup rolled oats  </P> <P> 1/3 cup oat bran  </P> <P> 1 cup boiling water  </P> <P> 1 cup sugar  </P> <P> 1/3 cup oil  </P> <P> 2 eggs  </P> <P> 2 cups nonfat or low-fat yogurt  </P> <P> 1 cup all purpose flour  </P> <P> 1 cup whole-wheat flour  </P> <P> 3 teaspoons baking soda  </P> <P> 2 cups bran flakes  </P> <P> Combine oats, oat bran and water.

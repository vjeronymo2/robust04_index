			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities steadier but remain nervous ATTEMPTS by the London stock market to recover yesterday from its post-Budget gloom were restrained by disappointing statistics on unemployment, wages and unit wage costs, and by mixed signals from the public opinion polls. The brightest feature was the improvement in stock index futures, where the March contract on the FT-SE Index closed at a premium to cash for the first time for several sessions. At the opening, the stock market decided to respond to the latest Gallup poll, indicating a two-point lead for the governing Conservative party, rather than to an NOP poll showing a four-point lead for Labour. Shares opened higher but the gain was increased to some 13 points on the Footsie only after the stock index futures made a firm start. The rise was as swiftly reversed when the March futures contract temporarily shed its premium against the underlying cash market, where the Footsie fell to a net loss of 9.8, bringing it to within five points of the 2,450 mark. Both markets were undermined by news of a further rise in UK unemployment last month, a factor seen as further damaging the government's re-election chances and thus increasing the danger of a 'hung' parliament. However, the market later rallied, and was helped by a firm start on Wall Street, where the Dow gained 9.61 in early trading. The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,467.6 for an improvement on the day of 2.9 points. Trading volume remained disappointing and the City of London was still very nervous regarding the progress of the government's re-election campaign. Today brings the close of the Budget trading account in equities, and leaves the market facing a loss of around 130 Footsie points over the period. UK securities markets have shown disappointment with the size of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement disclosed in the chancellor's Budget speech and have also been hurt by the dwindling hopes for a cut in base rates. Seaq volume edged higher to 484.3m shares from the previous day's 454.3m; but Wednesday's retail, or customer, value was low at Pounds 867.2m, indicating once again that the big insti-tutions are staying on the sidelines until the political outlook clears. The FT-SE Index finally provided little guide to the market's mood, because it was distorted by movements in a handful of leading shares. Cable and Wireless fell heavily, taking an effective two points off the Footsie, after confirming a re-organisation plan. On the other side of the scale, Midland Bank continued to advance, although some selling was seen at the day's high point; the market hopes for further developments in the merger situation but traders were also taking profits. Shares in the other UK clearing banks also continued to attract interest as the market wondered what else is in store. Indications that at least one other UK bank had shown interest in acquiring Midland appear to open the door to further reshaping of the industry. The Midland move also refuelled bid speculation across the range of the market, with some building shares moving higher as investors tried to identify likely targets in a sector badly shaken by the effect of high domestic interest rates on the construction industry.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Property: Charm in a little corner of Chelsea THE FINEST surviving house in London by Charles Robert Ashbee (1863-1942), the influential architect, designer and romantic socialist, has come on to the market. It is 38 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, a tall, narrow, red-brick building with high, thin windows and a steep, white-painted gable, in the middle of which is a large rose window. Built in 1898-99 for an artist, Miss CL Christian, it stood originally between two other Ashbee houses, only one of which survives. Ashbee's first house was at 37 Cheyne Walk, on the corner of Oakley Street; it was built in 1893-94 for his mother, with an office and studio for himself. Known as the Magpie &amp; Stump, after an inn that used to stand on the site, it was demolished in 1968 to make way for a block of luxury flats. When No. 38 was built, Ashbee erected the adjoining house, 39 Cheyne Walk, at the same time, as a speculation. It survives, although altered internally. (A perspective of both was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1900.) For all his socialist ideals, Ashbee was quite an important contractor and developer in his own right, and he made this little corner of Chelsea his own. Between 1893 and 1913 he designed no fewer than 30 houses in Cheyne Walk. Not all were built; but those that were (at 71-75), and those he repaired and altered for clients (at 118-119), were destroyed by German bombs in 1941. That leaves No. 38: listed Grade II for its architectural interest. 'We tried to take the house back to what it was in the beginning,' says Ninky Phipps, who bought it with her husband 10 years ago and restored it carefully. They used a Scottish architect, Alastair Gourley, who has captured the spirit of Ashbee and laced it with a touch of Charles Rennie Mackintosh. He re-designed the kitchen, bathrooms and cloakrooms and installed fitted cupboards in the bedrooms and display shelves on the stairs. The Phipps also have used the house as an art gallery, and it would make an ideal home for an art collector because its drawing room on the first floor was the main studio: 39 ft long with a ceiling 17 ft high, and steps to a gallery running along one side. There was another studio 32 ft long and 15 ft high, on the third floor, and a third studio on the top floor, 20 feet long, with an exposed timber ceiling, lit by the circular rose window facing south over the Thames. These former studios are now used as bedrooms, and there are two other bedrooms and three bathrooms. The dining room, kitchen and breakfast room are on the ground floor, which is reached through ornamental gates and railings topped with golden balls, designed by Ashbee and made by his Guild of Handicraft. At the back of the house is a secluded walled garden, part of it with Tudor brickwork thought to date from 1519, when the site was part of Shrewsbury House. Offers of Pounds 1.65m for the freehold are being sought by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (tel: 071-824-8171), which is acting jointly with Russell Simpson (071-225-0277). Freeholds are unusual in Chelsea, as most of the properties are held on lease from one or other of the traditional landowners such as Smith's Charity, Sloane-Stanley or the Cadogan estate. But there is another freehold on the market at 3 Cheyne Walk, another Grade II-listed Georgian house. Offers of Pounds 1.95m are being invited by Strutt &amp; Parker (071-235-9959).</p>

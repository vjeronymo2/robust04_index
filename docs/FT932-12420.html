			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / International Company News: Gencor lifts income 6% despite weak markets A SOUND operating performance against a background of depressed commodity markets saw attributable income at Gencor, South Africa's second-largest mining house, increase by 6 per cent to R593m (Dollars 188.7m) in the six months to February. Mr Brian Gilbertson, executive chairman, said he believed Gencor's operational performance compared favourably with other resource companies. He said the board had yet to decide whether it was in favour of the break-up of the group's non-mining interests. He said that a decision would be taken by the end of June at the latest, if not much sooner. Although the larger number of shares in issue saw earnings per share decline by 10 per cent to 43.1 cents, the dividend is being maintained at 16 cents a share. Mr Gilbertson said Gencor was unlikely to maintain the level of earnings reported during the current six months. He said commodity prices remained very weak, with few signs of an upturn. Despite the poor outlook, he said that on very conservative forward assumptions, Gencor would have no financial problems in funding the large capital projects - Alusaf, Columbus, the Engen refinery upgrade and the expansion of Sappi's Saiccor plant - it is committed to. Mr Gilbertson expressed regret that the group had not made more progress in establishing an offshore presence. He said tighter Reserve Bank restrictions on offshore deals made such ventures difficult to achieve. Lower capital expenditure and a much improved performance from Western Areas helped the Johannesburg Consolidated Investment group post a 45 per cent increase in profit after tax and capital expenditure in the March quarter to R36.5m, against R25.2m. This increase was achieved despite further operational setbacks at the Joel mine, where continued poor grades saw gold production fall by 14 per cent. After-tax profit slid to R1.7m from R5.2m.</p>

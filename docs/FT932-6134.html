			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Labour leader faces defeat on one member one vote plan MR JOHN Smith, the Labour leader, faces the prospect of defeat at the autumn party conference over his plan to introduce one member one vote for the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates after another normally moderate union rejected the proposal yesterday. The Union of Communication Workers' conference voted to oppose any plans to weaken or remove the union's voting strength in selecting Labour candidates and electing the party leader and deputy leader. Before the last election unions accounted for 40 per cent of the vote in the selection process. Mr Smith has turned one member one vote into a test of his own political credibility but the only big union so far prepared to back him over the issue is the AEEU engineering union. Seven of the top eight unions affiliated to the Labour party are opposed to his plan. Efforts may have to be made to compromise on the issue but any climbdown by Mr Smith would deal a severe blow to his position at a time when he needs to reassert his authority in the party. Early last week delegates at the conference of MSF - the professional and technicians union - also rejected the advice of their leaders and voted to oppose one member one vote despite a strong speech from Mr Smith. The Labour leader had hoped to win wider support inside the unions by his recent suggestion that union political levy payers should be entitled to cut-price membership of the party to participate in candidate selections. But his idea has so far failed to impress union leaders who want to uphold union organisational links with Labour at local level. Over the past few weeks Mr Smith has made it clear that he wants to maintain close ties with the trade unions, which he believes are valuable in keeping Labour in touch with industrial realities. But at the same time he believes it is in the interest of unions that they do not play a dominant role in selection. In a speech on Thursday, Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, rejected one member one vote but proposed instead the unions should ballot among their 4m political levy-paying members on selecting Labour candidates. 'Local union members, living in the constituency and paying the political levy , could cast individual votes amounting to no more than a third of the total', explained Mr Edmonds. 'This system would significantly broaden the electoral base of selected candidates'. Supporters of one member one vote point out that Mr Smith does not need to win a majority of union votes at conference to secure that objective.</p>

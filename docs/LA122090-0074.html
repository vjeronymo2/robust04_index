			<p><P> December 20, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIEWS CLARIFIED  </P> <P> Your Dec. 6 article entitled "City Again Considers Staging a Comeback for  Historic Theater" misrepresented the position of The Glendale Historical  Society (TGHS).  </P> <P> TGHS leaders were not "miffed" by the mayor's formation of a task force. There  is general agreement in the city that a task force should be formed to work  with a professional consultant to design, develop and implement the Alex  project. The Alex Theatre Revitalization Project, a TGHS committee, was ready  to form the task force, but would have done so only with the cooperation of the  city. When the mayor decided to form the task force, TGHS was pleased and  viewed the action as a positive sign that the city was ready to move forward on  the Alex project. TGHS wholeheartedly supports the city task force and has  enthusiastically accepted an invitation to serve on it.  </P> <P> Regarding the makeup of the task force, TGHS and the city do not disagree. Had  the Alex Theatre Revitalization Project formed the task force, it would have  been a community-based group including representatives from City Council,  Glendale Redevelopment Agency staff, Historic Preservation Commission, TGHS,  Glendale business groups, performing arts professionals, local arts groups and  at-large business and community leadership -- the very groups the mayor has  suggested. The fact that the Alex Theatre Revitalization Project believes some  representatives from these groups should have expertise related to the  performing arts and/or theater restoration is not in conflict with the mayor's  plan.  </P> <P> The Alex Extravaganza, presented by The Glendale Historical Society's Alex  Theatre Revitalization Project, demonstrated wide community support for the  preservation of the Alex Theatre. We urge all interested citizens,  organizations and the press to focus on the community's common goal of  preserving the Alex. Perceiving differences of opinion about how this goal  should be accomplished as "an undercurrent of controversy" works against our  common goal and the ultimate success of the project.  </P> <P> ANDREA HUMBERGER  </P> <P> Humberger is president of the Glendale Historical Society  </P></p>

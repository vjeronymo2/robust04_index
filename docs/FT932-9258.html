			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Daimler-Benz predicts upturn after 96% plunge in quarter DAIMLER-BENZ, Germany's largest industrial group, yesterday reported a dramatic decline in net profits to only DM20m (Pounds 8.1m) for the first quarter of 1993, down from the DM480m achieved in the same period last year. Daimler described the result as 'exceptionally unsatisfactory', chiefly blaming weak demand in the German car and commercial vehicle market which hit Mercedes-Benz, the car manufacturer which generates two-thirds of the group's sales. Blighted by what Daimler called 'extremely difficult conditions' in world car markets, car production at Mercedes dropped by 39 per cent in the quarter to 94,500 units, down from 153,738 last year when conditions were still what Daimler called 'highly favourable'. The number of commercial vehicles produced fell by 27 per cent to 55,900. The results were not noticeably out of line with analysts' expectations after an accelerated drop in profits over the past two quarters of last year. Daimler indicated last month that profits would be 'considerably down' in the first quarter. But the results served to intensify analysts' scepticism about Daimler's ability to make the DM1bn profit for the whole of 1993 which it forecast last month after announcing 1992 profits down 25 per cent to DM1.45bn. Daimler yesterday predicted a 'significant upturn' later this year as a result of the scheduled introduction in June of the new C-class Mercedes, the replacement for the 10-year-old 190 series, the company's smaller executive car. For the Daimler-Benz group as a whole, total sales dropped 19 per cent to DM18.4bn for the quarter. First quarter sales at Mercedes dropped by 24 per cent to DM12.5bn. Daimler said that the trend in group results was distorted by comparison with a 'highly favourable' first quarter of last year. 'Business conditions deteriorated markedly only in the second half of last year,' Daimler said. At AEG, the electrical engineering unit which made operating losses of DM200m last year, sales dropped 7 per cent to DM2.2bn in the three months. At Deutsche Aerospace, sales were down 10 per cent to DM2.85bn, partially because of invoicing factors. Daimler-Benz InterServices, the services subsidiary, posted sales of DM2.1bn against DM1.74bn. Mercedes sales were hit especially hard by conditions in the domestic market  -where total car registrations dropped by a fifth in the quarter - and in other European countries and Japan. Sales were 'gratifyingly higher' in other south-east Asian markets and in eastern Europe.</p>

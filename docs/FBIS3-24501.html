			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. R. Grigoryev, S. P. Naumov; UDC 681.325] </F>   [Abstract] A structural circuit of a neural network  employing an algorithm for sorting a sequence of n-numbers is  examined. The structural circuit takes into account the  limitations concerning engineering implementation of the  proposed circuits on an optical neural chip. The examined  structural circuit was modeled as a package of computer  programs. The circuit consists of an adaptive neural network,  whose weight coefficients are adjusted depending on the input  data. Modeling of the neural network for n=256 with a program  package allowed to experimentally test the convergence of the  proposed neural algorithm and to verify the obtained analytical  time estimates of its performance. With the contemporary  technology of VLSIC, it is possible to develop neural chips  capable of sorting 512 numbers during a single cycle. Figures 9,  references 18.</p>

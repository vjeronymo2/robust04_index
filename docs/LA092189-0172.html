			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG ORPHANS;  </P> <P> PARENTS WHO CAN'T SAY 'NO' ARE CREATING A GENERATION OF MISERY  </P> <P> Before he witnessed the final proof, the boy found the circumstantial evidence.  There was the blowtorch under the bed and the fire-blackened "king-size" spoon  he had seen around the motel room -- both essentials in preparing illegal drugs  for injection.  </P> <P> But the clincher, he says, was the day he discovered his mother actually  sticking a needle into her arm.  </P> <P> "I knew what was going on," the 17-year-old recalls. "But until I caught her  red-handed shooting it, I thought she was just rocking it," he adds, referring  to his mother's use of rock or crack cocaine, which is usually smoked but can  be injected.  </P> <P> In the argument that followed, his mother told him of her drug use, "If you  don't like it, get the (blank) out."  </P> <P> He did.  </P> <P> "She was my mother," he says, describing the finality of the break three years  ago.  </P> <P> Another 17-year-old whose life centers around the Los Angeles Youth Network in  Hollywood also left home three years ago. His story is less dramatic but the  break seems equally permanent. His mother was a cocaine user, he says, and she  began selling household appliances, including a television she had given him as  a present, to buy drugs.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the unpaid bills, the lack of food and the general chaos of home  became too much.  </P> <P> "To tell you the truth when I left I didn't even know I was running away," he  says. "I thought I was just gone for a couple of days." After a pause, he adds,  "But after I got up here I found I could make a life for myself."  </P> <P> In the latest furor over drugs in American society, the lives of these two  juveniles are exercises in irony. Because their mothers could not say no to  drugs, both high school dropouts -- whose peer group is typically the focus of  anti-drug campaigns -- are homeless.  </P> <P> They aren't alone. Social service agencies, hospitals and child care facilities  in Los Angeles and around the country report that children -- ranging from  infants to adolescents -- are being forced into the homes of grandparents and  other relatives, foster care, psychiatric wards, even the streets by their  parents' drug use.  </P> <P> Locally, these drug orphans encompass a broad spectrum of misery, ranging from  the two 17-year-olds, whose outlook is relatively hopeful, to a 1-year-old girl  -- apparently blinded and suffering other brain damage from abuse she received  in the home of a drug-using parent. For the past three months the girl has  lived in a house operated by the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a private,  nonprofit group. She and the five other infants and children in the home  require 24-hour-care and most have physical and mental problems linked to  parental drug abuse. The blind girl, for instance, only recently emerged from a  nearly constant cocoon of sleep or semi-consciousness to make her first  attempts at crawling and walking, according to the bureau's Pat Darroch.  </P> <P> Care of the blind girl and the others in the home costs $4,200 to $4,500 a  month with about half subsidized by Los Angeles County, Darroch says. Children  generally stay at the house six to nine months -- until they are ready to be  reunited with their parents, who must be drug free and submit to random  testing, or to a foster home, she adds.  </P> <P> The children's bureau home is an extreme example of the care required by drug  children. By far the greatest number are placed with foster parents, who may  care for these children for years, even decades.  </P> <P> But despite such intervention, often at very early ages, those who work with  drug orphans often fear they are doing too little, too late. Although their  perspective may be skewed by close association with the children, there is a  striking unanimity of opinion that the next generation will be a troubled one.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sounding a Warning  </P> <P> Darroch's comment is typical. "The school system is going to be flooded with  these kids in a couple of years," she says, sounding a warning that already has  become a reality in many school districts, including Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Avon Dawdy, president of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Foster Parents  Assn. and a foster parent for more than 25 years, has concerns that are more  far-reaching. "If we don't do something to curb the drug use of these people  who are having babies, we're going to have an entire generation that can't take  care of themselves," she declares.  </P> <P> Will Devers, who specializes in "high-risk" drug-child cases at the Los Angeles  Department of Children's Services, says that an infant turned over to the care  of his department often has siblings who also must be found and cared for. His  current case load totals 48 drug babies, he says, all but two with  cocaine-using parents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Drug Horror Stories  </P> <P> Social workers seem to have an inexhaustible fund of horror stories about the  children of drug-abusing parents. Darroch, Devers and others tell tales of  parents living in cars with their children because they could not both pay the  rent and buy drugs, of squalor that repels hardened policemen and refrigerators  so empty "there wasn't even a cockroach that had died of starvation."  </P> <P> Children born in such circumstances start life with biological as well as  environmental handicaps. Research by Dr. Ira Chasnoff, a pediatrician at  Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, and others indicates that babies  born of addicted mothers are more likely to have lower birth weights and  smaller brains, indications that later on they may have learning disabilities  as well as behavioral abnormalities.  </P> <P> Chasnoff, who is president of a perinatal research group involved in long-term  study of cocaine-addicted infants, cautions, however, that researchers are only  beginning to track the children of cocaine users so that the long-term impact,  while potentially enormous, is unknown. "We've never had a drug like cocaine  before that has affected such a large number of families," he says, noting that  heroin, alcohol and other addictive drugs don't seem to have the "chaotic"  impact of cocaine on the family.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Unknown Scope  </P> <P> Despite these emerging concerns, the overall dimensions of the problem --  nationally and regionally -- are unclear, largely because no single agency or  group tracks all such cases. There are indicators of its scope, though, ranging  from figures supplied by local agencies to the anecdotal testimony of social  workers, foster parents and doctors.  </P> <P> Most widely publicized are the so-called "crack babies," infants born with  their mother's addiction to that cheap, highly addictive and easily obtainable  form of cocaine.  </P> <P> And there are new, startling bits of evidence that this earliest form of child  abuse may cut across economic and racial lines. A study released over the  weekend by Chasnoff and other researchers found no significant difference in  the rate of drug use during pregnancy by middle- and upper-income women  compared with indigent women who most often have been blamed for the surge in  addicted babies.  </P> <P> "People have always assumed that it (drug abuse during pregnancy) is only a  problem in urban minority populations," said Chasnoff.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Testing Positive  </P> <P> The study of 715 pregnant women in Pinellas County, Fla., during the first six  months of this year found that 15.4% of white patients tested positive for  drugs while 14.1% of black patients tested positive. But it also found that  minority women who use drugs or alcohol during pregnancy are almost 10 times  more likely to be reported to child-abuse authorities than white woman who do  so, because many attend public clinics that are required by law to report  suspected perinatal substance abuse.  </P> <P> Nationwide, it is estimated that as many as 375,000 children are born annually  with some form of drug addiction. Estimates for cocaine-addicted babies run as  high as 200,000 per year -- with the rate doubling each year in major cities.  </P> <P> Locally, the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services reports that  2,284 infants suffering from some form of maternal drug abuse -- usually  cocaine -- were referred to the department from August, 1988 to July, 1989.  That's an average of 190 infants per month.  </P> <P> "Nearly all of our babies that are coming into the (foster care) system are  drug babies," says foster parent Dawdy. Like others, Dawdy cares for infants  and children referred by the county's children's services department. Another  foster parent, Jeanette Lohnes says, "I get at least five calls a day (to care)  for drug babies. That's all we're getting these days is drug babies." Dawdy,  Lohnes and others agree that a dramatic rise in drug-afflicted infants began  three to four years ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Difficult Count  </P> <P> Beyond infancy the counting of drug orphans becomes more difficult.  </P> <P> At the Los Angeles Youth Network's drop-in center in Hollywood, social worker  Charles Hoeker estimates that roughly half of the 20 to 30 homeless teen-agers  who stop by daily left home partly because of parental drug and alcohol abuse.  Dr. Thomas Hicklin, psychiatrist in charge of the 15-bed children's ward at Los  Angeles County Medical Center, says that perhaps a quarter of his patients have  problems related to drug abuse by parents. It's not a large number, he says,  but then the ward is the end-of-the-line for many children from drug-abuse  homes. "The ones that we see can't make it in foster homes," he explains.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, a study by the National Committee on the Prevention of Child Abuse  found that last year in the Washington, D.C. area -- one of the few areas where  such figures are available -- 90 percent of "caretakers" reported for child  abuse were active substance abusers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Requests for Care  </P> <P> In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, requests for foster care increased  71% from 1985 to 1987, according to a regional government study. Though dated,  the latter finding supports the widely held opinion among social workers and  foster parents that they are being deluged with infants and children whose  lives have been deformed by drug abuse in the womb and in life.  </P> <P> "If there's physical abuse or sexual abuse, it's probably related to drug  abuse," says Darroch of the children's bureau. ". . . I guess I haven't had the  experience of having a stone sober person who sexually abused their child."  </P> <P> By current standards, then, older drug orphans such as the two 17-year-olds may  be lucky. The first, for instance, recounts only one example of attempted abuse  by his mother and one severe beating by assailants on the street. Although he  admits to using cocaine heavily himself, he maintains that he has largely  stayed away from drugs for the past two years. "I despise drugs now," he says  with apparent conviction. Moreover, social worker Hoeker credits him with a  quick mind, honesty and a willingness to try to get off the streets, currently  by trying to join the Navy.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, during a conversation it becomes clear that his mother's use of  drugs has marked him for life in sad and peculiar ways.  </P> <P> "I was told I was born in Hawaii. I've been told I was born in L.A.," he says.  " . . . I don't even know where I was born."  </P></p>

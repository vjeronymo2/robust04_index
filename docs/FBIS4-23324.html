			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Text] First to Malawi. Question: Can the new men in power  in Malawi get their act together? They are in the news this  morning and it seems the answer to that question is not yet.  The United Democratic Front, the UDF, won the presidency  outright in the recent elections, but not the parliamentary  elections. So, they started talking to one of the smaller  parties, Aford, the Alliance for Democracy, about the  possibility of working together. Well, Aford's terms were that  there should be a coalition government and that its party  leader, Mr. Chakufwa Chihana, should become a vice president.  The talks have been going on since last week, but the news this  morning is not good. The meeting has been called off, there is  no agreement. On the line to Blantyre, David Stein asked the  defense minister of the UDF government, Cassim Chilumpha, why  the talks have broken down.    [Begin recording] [Chilumpha] We don't think that really we  should be talking about a coalition government. What we should  be talking about is Aford joining the government, just like the  two other parties have. During those discussions we offered  them three ministerial posts and we also said that we couldn't  accept that Mr. Chakufwa Chihana should be vice president  because constitutionally there can only be one vice president in  the country and you can't have two vice presidents. That vice  president has already been sworn-in anyway, so there is no post  of vice president that Mr. Chihana can take up. So, we said, if  that is the case, we didn't see the reason for continuing the  talks, because we felt that there was no need for us to form a  coalition government. All we could do was offer ministerial  posts to Aford.    [Stein] As far as you are concerned then, have these talks  effectively collapsed?    [Chilumpha] We didn't set another date for, you know,  continuation of the talks, you know, as we see it, the door is  still open for Aford to come and join us in government and that  is where I understand we left off.    [Stein] Will you approach them again or will they have to  come to you?    [Chilumpha] Well, that is a matter which, you know, we will  have to examine as we go along, but as of now, our position is  that really the ball is in the court of Aford. We have told  them exactly what we can offer and we think that if they are  serious in working with us, they should take us up on that offer.    [Stein] Are you prepared to compromise at all? I mean, after  all, let us look at the role of Mr. Chihana, a very experienced  politician who, some would say, would be an asset to your  cabinet, and they say that they want him to be vice president.  Would you consider offering him another key position?    [Chilumpha] I think that UDF made it very clear that if he  wanted a ministerial post that could be given.    [Stein] But so far the posts you have offered are those of  forestry and physical planning, and I don't think Mr. Chihana  will probably think those were high profile enough.    [Chilumpha] Well, again, that is where the problem really  lies. I think that if we are going to, you know, make headway in  these, you know, talks, and in building a new Malawi, we should  not come with preconceived ideas and conditions that demand. I  think we should just come, you know, over to talk, you know.  UDF has been all along saying that let us, you know, talk, it  was Aford who snapped at us in December to say they couldn't  work with us, because they called us all sorts of names --  rapists, murderers, and so on. All along, you know, we have kept  the door open to them, saying that we should come and work  together. We did work together during the referendum, but we  have been snapped at all along and all we are doing now is to  extend the same arm of friendship and cooperation to them and we  think that it is high time that they should come over and join  us. [end recording]    Well, let us hear from the other side now, Aford, the  Alliance for Democracy. Their secretary general is (Meke  Mtewa). On the line, David Stein asked Mr. (Mtewa) if his party  would be prepared to continue negotiating with the ruling UDF.    [Begin recording] [(Mtewa)] Actually, I don't think it is us  who have been approaching the party of the United Democratic  Front. They have had the privilege and pleasure of approaching  us in the past. If it is their intention to continue to talk  about anything material including, of course, the maintenance of  national unity, I am afraid, my party, the Alliance for  Democracy, is interested in both issues, and would continue to  talk with them for the duration and tenure of the government.    [Stein] Let's talk about the specific things that you are  trying to achieve from these particular talks, which is, one, an  indication that this government could be a coalition government  and two, a key role for Mr. Chihana as vice president. They  have said that neither of those are acceptable. Would you  consider any kind of alliance with them on another basis?    [(Mtewa)] We have understood them not to prefer a coalition  with us. They are only inviting us in a limited partnership and  that is of a participatory nature.    [Stein] So, would you accept that limited partnership at  all?    [(Mtewa)] That is for them to offer and for us to understand  exactly in what scope, by that, of course a limited partnership  would mean, if indeed that is the understanding and ours, that  we will not be delivering to them our legislative and  parliamentary group of members in parliament, except, of course  to the extent, only to help and to aid them in administering  those ministries which they feel we ought to be able to share in  that limited sense.    [Stein] If we take Mr. Chihana, for example, they have  already said that he can't be vice president because there is  already a vice president. Now, why doesn't Mr. Chihana just  accept the offer of one of those other cabinet positions?    [(Mtewa)] Mr. Chihana, of course, as president of the  Alliance for Democracy has more pressing and binding  responsibilities to lead the party, also the parliament, and to  make sure that he organizes best and strengthens the foundations  of this party for the next elections, including those of  district and town council, and such other municipal elections  forthcoming in this country. I cannot see him accepting any  such role in the United Democratic Front government at this  stage.    [Stein] Is it true that Aford has been holding meetings with  the MCP [Malawi Congress Party] about the possibility of working  together?    [(Mtetwa)] Purely as partners in the maintenance of this  fragile democracy. Both the Malawi Congress Party and the  Alliance for Democracy have, in the interest the maintenance and  the safeguard and preservation of this [word indistinct] balance  called the Malawi Democratic [word indistinct].    [Stein] But, would you seriously consider working with the  Malawi Congress Party against the UDF in parliament?    [(Mtetwa)] Not against the UDF in parliament. We will be  working together in preservation of our democratic tradition as  it is just beginning. [end recording]</p>

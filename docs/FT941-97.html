			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Cornhill Ins rises tenfold to Pounds 31.5m Cornhill Insurance, the UK offshoot of Allianz Group, yesterday reported a tenfold increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 31.5m for 1993. The increase, which the company said was driven by motor and personal insurance, came after profits of Pounds 3.1m last year and a loss of Pounds 39.5m in 1991. Overall premium income rose marginally to Pounds 709m, compared with Pounds 706.8m. Of the total Pounds 605.2m (Pounds 619.9m including discontinued operations) from general business and Pounds 103.8m (Pounds 86.9m) from life business. From continuing operations, there were profits of Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 15.9m losses) from general business and profits of Pounds 300,000 (Pounds 2.9m) from life business, offset by a charge of Pounds 800,000 to a profit sharing scheme. The company said that commercial insurance improved but remained in loss, partly as a result of the property claims following the IRA bombing of Bishopsgate in London last year.</p>

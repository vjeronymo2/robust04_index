			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aydyn Mekhtiyev under the rubric "Geopolitics": </F> "Ankara Wants To Restrict the Passage of Tankers Through Its  Straits. Moscow Will Most Likely Not Support This Action"]    [Text] An accident involving a supertanker carrying fuel  that occurred in the Turkish Strait of Bosphorus last Sunday has  made topical the issue of ensuring safety in the Straits of  Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. Previously, the Ministry of  Foreign Affairs of Turkey made a statement that an increase in  the intensiveness of transportation in the straits will pose a  real threat to Istanbul and its 10 million residents.    A NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent has learned from sources  in the Turkish Government that a document strictly regulating  procedures for the passage of ships through the straits will  take effect 1 July of this year. In keeping with this document,  which consists of 59 points, all tankers passing through the  Bosphorus and the Dardanelles will have to notify the Turkish  authorities about entering the straits in advance and have to  pay duties, the volume of which will depend on the size of the  tanker.    It is envisioned that in the event that the length of the  tanker exceeds 150 meters, all traffic in the straits will be  stopped for four to five hours. This will unavoidably result in  a disruption of shipping and the forced layover of dozens of  vessels. Naturally, the company-owner of the supertanker will  have to defray all material costs entailed by this.    It is believed in Ankara that firm restrictions of this  nature are a forced step in order to contain the intensiveness  of shipping, which has recently increased sharply. Moreover, as  soon as a few years after the beginning of the development of  the Caspian Sea and Kazakhstan fields, about 30-40 million  tonnes of oil will be carried through the straits annually,  which will sharply increase the scale of ecological catastrophe  should yet another accident occur.    The document prepared in the Turkish Government should be,  in  a way, a warning signal to neighboring countries that are  considering the possibility of transporting oil through the  Turkish straits. This concerns, in particular, three  countries--Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan. The Russian side  is trying to convince Baku and Alma-Ata [Almaty] of the need to  deliver the produced oil to the port of Novorossiysk, from which  oil supertankers will transport it to the Mediterranean,  naturally, through the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles.  In turn, Ankara proposes to consider the possibility of building  an oil pipeline which would run through Turkish territory.    Azerbaijan verbally supports the Turkish plan. However, the  apprehension in Ankara is that Geydar Aliyev will not be able to  withstand pressure from Moscow on this issue. Several days ago,  Vakhid Alekperov, president of the Russian oil company Lukoyl,  visited Baku; in the course of negotiations with the Azerbaijani  company Sokar he stressed that materialization of the Russian  project promises considerable economic advantage. It appears  that Kazakhstan has already made its choice in favor of the  Russian project. Besides, according to information from  confidential sources in Ankara, Moscow has already secured  support from the U.S. Administration with regard to its oil  transportation project. Restrictions on the movement of tankers  in the straits to be introduced by Ankara directly affect the  interests of a consortium of Western oil companies that will  soon begin the production of oil in the region. It is easy to  foresee that Western companies, which are interested in the  lowest outlays on transporting oil to Europe, will hardly want  to pay duty for supertankers to enter the Turkish straits.    So far Moscow has been silent about the intention of the  Turkish Government to restrict the movement of tankers in the  straits. Apparently, at Smolenskaya Square they have so far been  analyzing the results of the recently completed visit to Ankara  of a technical group of the Russian Federation Ministry of  Foreign Affairs headed by Yakov Ostrovskiy. A source in the  Russian Federation Ministry of Foreign Affairs has informed a  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA correspondent that in defining its position,  Moscow will proceed from the Convention on Banning Restrictions  on Shipping in the Straits of Bosphorus and the Dardanelles,  which was signed in 1936 in Montreux. The Russian side may  accuse Turkey of violating this international document. Ankara  will respond to this accusation as follows: "Yes indeed, the  Montreux convention establishes a free navigation regimen in the  straits. However, the whole issue is that in 1936, when this  document was signed, the large-size tankers we have now did not  exist. Besides, the notion of using the straits to ship millions  of tonnes of oil a year was not contemplated at that time."    Therefore, the dispute may become protracted; with regard to  this issue, a lot will depend on which side the West and the  United States support.</p>

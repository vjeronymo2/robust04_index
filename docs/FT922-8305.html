			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Survey of World Electricity (12): North Sea bubble - Doubts on the UK dash for gas WHEN Roosecote power station opened in Barrow-in-Furness last October, it was hailed as the first in a new generation of gas-fired power plant that would provide new competition for the privatised UK electricity industry. Referring to the 20 'significant' private power projects that are in the pipeline, Mr John Wakeham, the then energy secretary, said: 'I am convinced that independent projects are poised to play an increasingly important role in the future of the electricity generating market.' But the proliferation of these projects has not been welcomed by all of Mr Wakeham's fellow politicians. The House of Commons select committee on energy has issued repeated warnings that the construction of many new gas-fired stations could be a case of 'competition for its own sake'. National Grid, the company which owns and operates the electricity transmission system, cautioned last month that if all of the current power projects came on stream, they would contribute to 60 per cent over-capacity in the market by 1997. The company said it had 28 applications from new independent projects to join the national grid, amounting to 22,370 MegaWatts of new capacity by 1997. This implies that around 10 older, coal-fired stations would have to close in order to achieve a more reasonable margin of 30 per cent excess capacity. It highlights a fear in the industry that the days are numbered for many efficient coal-fired plants. In addition, the economic case for many of the new gas stations has not been proven. Critics argue that, for many of the projects, high gas prices will lead to an electricity price higher than that of the coal-fired plant. Since many of the regional electricity companies are partners in a number of the gas-fired generation projects, the critics claim that higher electricity prices will be passed on to the captive domestic consumer. Gas-fired power stations are undoubtedly cleaner than coal stations and many advocates of the new wave of generating plant point to their environmental benefits. But British Coal has estimated that, if coal plant is fitted with scrubbers which reduce emissions, the price of the electricity produced would still be slightly lower than the cost of power from a gas-fired plant. Mr David Porter, chief executive of the Association of Independent Electricity Producers, justifies the dash for gas: 'Britain should enjoy the benefits of diversity in power generation and that includes a role for coal, but the electricity industry cannot sustain itself by pricing its product on the output of fully depreciated coal-fired power stations.' The great wave of interest in new generating plant came with the blessing of the government when the electricity industry was privatised just over two years ago. Mr John Wakeham, energy secretary (the position has now been axed), was keen to see the development of competitors to National Power and PowerGen, the privatised generators of England and Wales carved from the old Central Electricity Generating Board. Overseas energy companies rushed to link up with regional electricity suppliers in a bid to build new plant. Simultaneously, the two generators themselves announced plans for an ambitious construction programme of gas-fired power stations. At the time, gas prices were reasonable and supplies were plentiful. But as British Gas became inundated with a flow of enquiries for gas contracts, it realised it would not have enough gas supply to fill them all. By March last year, the company moved to push up gas prices and cut off demand, in the process rendering many of the proposed power projects uneconomic. British Gas was eventually forced by its regulator to reduce its price increase although it has limited the availability of gas. Since the new price under the so-called LTI3 schedule is still higher than the pre-increase price, many of the projects teeter on the brink of viability. So far, nine projects have signed contracts for gas supply with British Gas, several others are pursuing deals with other producers and four additional projects are confident of securing supply. In addition, 10 projects have received planning permission. As well as the cost of gas supply, the location of the project and the efficiency of the plant will also influence its economics. But it is probably true to assume that not all of the 28 projects which have applied to the National Grid for a connection to the transmission system, will eventually be built. Consultants and industry observers estimate that between 14 and 20 projects are viable.</p>

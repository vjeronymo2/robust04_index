			<p>930726 FT  26 JUL 93 / International Capital Markets: SG Warburg - Correction SG Warburg was last week wrongly described as the architect of a new money purchase service with a guaranteed fund. In fact, Mercury Asset Management (MAM) is offering the product through its Mercury Life Assurance Company subsidiary. Munich Reinsurance has agreed to provide reinsurance on the potential liabilities of Mercury Life in connection with the guaranteed fund. MAM is 75 per cent owned by the SG Warburg group.</p>

			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / International Company News: Foreign side boosts Deutsche Bank Deutsche Bank's expanding foreign business and sharp growth in returns from trading on its own account were the main contributors to its 23 per cent increase in net earnings last year, according to Mr Hilmar Kopper, chairman. Forecasting a similar result of DM2.2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) after tax for the current financial year, he said foreign profits rose 63 per cent in 1993. Deutsche Bank AG, the parent company, had 'quite a bad year' in its domestic operations, where net earnings were virtually unchanged at DM1.4bn. Operating profits for the first two months, excluding risk provisions, were about level with the same period last year, Mr Kopper said at a press conference. 'The group made good progress in its efforts to offset risk through regional and sectoral diversification,' he said in a review of last year. The chairman, repeating earlier warnings that the banking system was typically worst affected at the end of a recession and well into the upturn, said provisions against bad debts had increased 72 per cent to DM3.3bn. Almost the entire amount had been set aside against risks in Germany. However, sprightly economic recovery abroad and growing business in currencies and securities compensated for some of the domestic difficulties. The Morgan Grenfell group generated DM439m in earnings, and the Banca d'America e d'Italia made DM314m, Mr Kopper said. As reported earlier, DB Luxembourg generated DM633m pre-tax partly from a heavy flow of funds out of Germany prompted by the introduction of a withholding tax last year. Profits from own account trading rose 76 per cent to DM2bn, including a DM400m contribution from derivatives, which Mr Kopper stoutly defended against recent international criticism. The debate about derivatives had obscured their main purpose as a hedge against risks. 'A bank that fails to exploit the full range of opportunities is not doing its job,' he said. Net commission income rose 26 per cent to DM5.8bn, while net interest earnings rose 7.4 per cent to DM11.7bn. The group's net interest margin narrowed further from 2.30 per cent to 2.21 per cent, and from 2.57 per cent to 2.49 per cent at the parent company. This proved that charges that the bank was not passing on rate reductions were unfounded, Mr Kopper said. He also pointed out that the group had invested DM4bn in eastern Germany, and had yet to make any profits there, but it was not complaining. By rule-of-thumb reckoning, earnings from the former GDR might start flowing in two or three years, he added. Summarising last year's results, Mr Kopper confirmed group operating profits rose 16 per cent to DM5.3bn after risk provisions, while operating expenses increased 12.6 per cent to DM11.7bn. Excluding first-time consolidations, the rise was 6.5 per cent, he said. Deutsche announced this week a DM1.50 dividend increase to DM16.50 per share. Including tax credits the pay-out will give domestic shareholders DM23.57, compared with DM23.44 last time. Lex, Page 13</p>

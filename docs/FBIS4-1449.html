			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by IEC Chairman Johann Kriegler in </F> Johannesburg with correspondents at IEC headquarters at the  Gallagher Estate, Midrand; conference moderated by the IEC's  Pieter Cronje--live, broadcast in progress]    [Text] [Kriegler]... the Cape, the [Orange] Free State,  North West -- I am proud and pleased to say in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] everything is under  control, voting ID going well, we are reasonably satisfied that  all prospective voters will be able to cast their votes in those  areas, if not by seven o'clock tonight, within the extended  hours that will be allowed by the presiding officers at any  voting stations where there are still people waiting. With  regard to the Eastern Transvaal, overall the picture is good; in  KwaMahlangu there was a problem that has been resolved and we  are satisfied that there also the prospective voters will be  able to exercise their franchise by close of business tonight.  With regard to the Northern Transvaal, the Eastern Cape, and  KwaZulu/Natal, there are distinct problems in the erstwhile  homeland or self-governing or independent territories namely  Venda, Gazankulu and Lebowa in Northern Transvaal, in the  KwaZulu part of KwaZulu/Natal and in the Transkei/Ciskei  components of the Eastern Cape Province.    The IEC is satisfied that because of its difficulties in  provisioning those areas, the voters there have not had a fair  and free opportunity to express their view. It is therefore The  IEC's view that extension of voting for those areas for tomorrow  should be instituted. It is not within the power of the IEC to  do so, and a recommendation to that effect has been made to the  Transitional Executive Council, and via that body to the state  president. I'm confident in the light of the strong evidence of  substantial inadequacy of voting, that the citizens of those  areas will be granted the opportunity. But I reiterate it's not  within my power, nor that of the commission.    [Cronje] May we take the questions singly? Would you please  introduce yourself, no supplementary at this stage until we've  had a first round of questions.    [Correspondent John Baptist] Judge, I would like to ask, Mr.  Mandela made an allegation earlier today that there had been  massive sabotage at the polls. Could you comment on this please?    [Kriegler] I dealt yesterday with sabotage as one of the  possible inferences to be drawn from the gross undersupply in  various parts of the country of IEC material. I will not at  this stage be prepared to express a preference form anyone of  the inferences. It is certainly one of them.    [Correspondent Desmond Howell] Judge, when will counting  start in those areas where voting ends today, and when will you  start announcing those results?    [Kriegler] Counting will not start until voting has closed  so  that there can be no influencing of voters still voting, by  possible leakage of count figures from counting stations. But I  should say counting is a much more complex exercise than most  people realize, there are many hours of reconciliation of  returns from voting stations, from districts, from areas to be  done, allocations to be done, and ballot boxes according to the  particular voting district. In addition a possible volkstaat  [homeland] concept, consideration of the debate in that respect  necessitates a special subdivision of voting stations and there  are many hours of work to be done long before awe get around to  actual counting. To answer your question firmly and  unequivocally, counting will not start, that is counting proper  will not start until Saturday morning.    [Crone] Reg Nkondo, REUTERS.    [Nkondo] I'm Reg Nkondo from REUTERS. I just want to find  out whether in the areas where people will be allowed to vote  tomorrow, is there going to be a holiday or is it going to a be  a normal working day.    [Kriegler] Decidedly not a holiday, maybe a happy day  because  it is a voting day, but not a holiday.    [Crone] Karin Brynard. Karin?    [Correspondent Karin Brynard] I am Karin Brynard, RAPPORT.  The areas you referred to as the areas that had problems. What  is the extent of the problems?    [Kriegler] It is clear that voters were not given a  reasonable opportunity to cast their votes. In some areas for  instance in the Northern Transvaal as many as 120 voting  stations did not open at all until three o'clock this afternoon.    [Cronje] Kaiser with THE STAR, please.    [Correspondent Kaiser Motsumi] Mr. Justice Kriegler, Kaiser  Motsumi from THE STAR. The fact that voting will be taking place  in some parts of the country, are you in a position to tell us  whether the voting will be going on for the whole day until 7  P.M. again, of if it will be closing a little earlier tomorrow?    [Kriegler] The recommendation will be 7 o'clock so as not to  confuse voters. Those have been the voting hours and it's as  well that it remain like that.    [Cronje] Over there, please.    [Correspondent Gregory Katz] Justice Kriegler, Gregory Katz  from the DALLAS MORNING NEWS. What will be the status of  ballots in which there was no IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party]  sticker and presiding officers were told to hand write IFP and  to sign the ballot themselves, and to hand write a square? Will  those ballots be allowed or are those spoiled ballots?    [Kriegler] I have dealt with this a couple of times and I  think I will have to deal with it a couple of times more. That  is not a regular ballot, it is an irregular ballot. It does not  comply with the letter of the law. However, it is a ballot  which expresses unequivocally the wish of the voter. Therefore,  although an irregular ballot, it may well be taken into account  as an adequate expression of the voter's choice of party. Could  I... Pieter, Pieter?    [Cronje] Yes, I am here, judge.    [Kriegler] I am terribly sorry to be rude to the media  there.  I simply have to -- I've got to go back to this meeting and go  and get this extension finalized one way or another.    [Cronje] Can I limit it to three more questions? Will you  take them?    [Kriegler] Can we take two and call it a day, please?    [Cronje] Fine. I have the gentleman over here and then the  gentleman over here.    [Correspondent Sonny Raboch] I am Sonny Raboch, Radio  Nigeria. Judge, the situation, well, we are getting clearer  pictures now, but what I would like to find out -- in the event  that there is an act for an act of Parliament, since you've said  that IEC cannot take a decision of this nature except by an act  of Parliament, are we expecting that the voting may be forced to  continue as far as midnight tomorrow?    [Kriegler] No, no! No, if the Transitional Executive Council  and the state president accept the IEC's recommendation, it is  (?down more or less) to proclaim, formally to proclaim the  amendment of the Electoral Act as a matter of detail.    [Correspondent Paolo Banard] Paolo Banard from [name  indistinct] in Italy. Judge, to what extent did you liaise with  the chief minister, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, in the past 24 hours  to come to the recommendation that in these areas the elections  should be extended?    [Kriegler] The Inkatha Freedom Party's representatives and I  have been in contact this morning, as I have been in contact  with the leaders of many other parties. Dr. Mzimela, cabinet  minister of the former KwaZulu government and an IFP Central  Committee member is sitting in the meeting to which I will ask  your permission now to return.    [Cronje] Judge, thank you very much. Go well. Thank you  ladies and gentlemen.    [Kriegler] Thank you.</p>

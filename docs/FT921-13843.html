			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Eight-year low for US trade deficit as imports fall THE US trade deficit tumbled to its lowest level for more than eight years in November as recessionary forces curbed US demand for imports, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The merchandise trade deficit fell to Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2bn), far below analysts' expectations of a shortfall of about Dollars 6bn. The 40 per cent drop from October's deficit of Dollars 6.3bn mainly reflected a 5.5 per cent decline in imports. In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said industrial production fell 0.2 per cent in December to register its third consecutive monthly decline since the economy began to turn down in the autumn. For 1991 as a whole industrial production fell 1.9 per cent, the first annual decline since 1982. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment was also reported to have fallen to 67.1 per cent in early January after 68.2 per cent in December, a sign that consumers remain in low spirits. The decline in the trade deficit reflected a Dollars 2.4bn decline in imports to Dollars 41.0bn and a Dollars 0.3bn increase in exports to Dollars 37.5bn, a record in cash terms. The deficit was running at a seasonally-adjusted annual rate of Dollars 64.7bn in the first 11 months of last year, a sharp improvement from the annual shortfall of Dollars 101.7bn in 1990. However, many economists expect the deficit to begin rising again later this year if the economy stages its expected recovery from recession. Officals said the fall in industrial production last month partly reflected lower output from utilities because of warmer than usual weather. The total was also depressed by a 1 per cent decline in the production of motor vehicles and parts. Overall manufacturing output, however, rose by a marginal 0.1 per cent, reflecting an increase in output of non-durable goods. The operating rate of factories, mines and utilities fell 0.3 percentage points to 79.0 per cent, the lowest level since April and only fractionally above the trough reached last winter.</p>

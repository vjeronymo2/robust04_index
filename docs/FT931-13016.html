			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / World Trade News: Benetton to open in Cuba CUBA, one of the last bastions of hard-line communism, has opened its doors to capitalist retailing with a joint venture with Italy's Benetton clothing group. Benetton, with a network of 7,047 stores, plans eight shops in Cuba this year. The network may be extended depending on their success. The retailing venture is confined to popular tourist locations and sales will be in hard currencies only. It represents the first fruits of a 1991 Cuban law allowing equal participation joint ventures between state companies and outside partners. Although there has already been some foreign investment in Cuba, notably by Spanish groups in the hotels sector, the new venture is the first of its kind in retailing. The Benetton stores will be run by a newly-formed company set up between Cubanacan, the main government-owned tourism and commercial concern, and Connoly, a Bahamas-based company owned by Mr Enrico Garzaroli, an Italian businessman.</p>

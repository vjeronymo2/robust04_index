			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, March 31, IRNA -- The Persian daily ABRAR in  a commentary Thursday raised the likelihood of Moscow's  involvement in the downing of the Iranian passenger plane near  Stepanakert in Armenian controlled Karabakh on March 17.    It said that previously when other passenger planes happened  to fly over the area Moscow would immediately inform the  commander of Armenian forces of the scheduled flight over the  airspace of Armenia to make sure that the plane would not be  shot down, but that in the case of the Iranian plane none of the  navigation systems in the region operated as responsibly as they  should have. The commentary also noted that immediately after  the news of the downing of the plane broke out on the media  Moscow suggested that the Iranian passenger plane had been  flying over the region for reconnaissance purposes.    "The Russians having been traditionally slow in their  responses to current developments, their unwonted haste in  publicizing that suggestion makes their purpose all too  transparent," it added.    The C-130 bound for Tehran from Moscow with families of  Iranian diplomats in Russia on board, exploded in mid air and  crashed in Karabakh moments after it contacted Yerevan airport  control tower at 19:10 hours GMT. There were no survivors among  the 32 passengers and crew including 17 women on board. After  due investigations by an expert sent to the site of the crash by  Iran, the Foreign Ministry has confirmed that the plane was  missiled down by Armenian troops.    The commentary in ABRAR said "whether the downing of the  Iranian plane was the result merely of negligence on the part of  the systems in Armenia or it was imposed on that country as a  plot, Armenia would do itself good to evaluate the mishap  independent of the insinuations of the outsiders and assume  responsibility for it, and do something by way of appeasing her  neighbor Iran."    "Or else," the paper warned, "the incident will remain for  ever a thorny issue in the relations between Armenia and her  neighbor Iran."</p>

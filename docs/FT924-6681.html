			<p>921120 FT  20 NOV 92 / Germany slows fall in Europe's new car sales NEW car sales in west Europe were boosted last month by an increase of around 5 per cent in registrations in Germany, the biggest single market in Europe. The rise in Germany helped to compensate for falls in many of the small and medium-sized European markets and left sales in October virtually unchanged from the same month a year ago at 1.068m, an increase of 0.1 per cent. According to industry estimates new car sales in west Europe in the first 10 months of the year totalled 11.56m, a decline of 1.4 per cent from the corresponding period a year ago. New car registrations in Germany in the last couple of months have not yet begun to reflect the steep decline in new orders experienced by car makers since the summer. The most recent industry forecasts suggest that new car sales in Germany could fall by around 11 per cent in 1993. In the first 10 months of this year German new car sales are estimated to have fallen by 8 per cent to 3.36m from the record level reached in 1991 in the wake of reunification. Current forecasts suggest that west European new car sales could fall by around 3.5 per cent next year, chiefly under the impact of falling demand in Germany and in Italy. The weakening trend is already clear in Italy where sales in October fell by 2.9 per cent year-on-year, the third consecutive monthly fall. In the first 10 months of the year new car sales in Italy were still 3.3 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales have also been weakening in Spain, where new car demand in October fell by 9.1 per cent. In the first 10 months new car sales in Spain were still 10.9 per cent higher than a year ago. Sales in France in October were unchanged. In the UK, new car sales rose year-on-year by 8.2 per cent last month, but almost all of the boost came from the fleet sector. In the first 10 months sales were still 1.9 per cent below last year's already very depressed level.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                   WEST EUROPEAN NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS                           January-October 1992  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       Volume      Volume     Share (%)    Share (%)                       (Units)    Change(%)   Jan-Oct 92    Jan-Oct 91  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET          11,563,000     -1.4        100.0         100.0 MANUFACTURERS: Volkswagen*(incl.      2,014,000     +5.9         17.4          16.2 Audi,SEAT&amp;Skoda) General Motors         1,433,000     +0.3         12.4          12.2 (Opel/Vauxhall, US??? &amp; Saab)  -Opel/Vauxhall        1,371,000     +0.8         11.9          11.6  -Saab**                  44,000     -1.1          0.4           0.4 Peugeot (incl.         1,399,000     +0.9         12.1          11.8 Citroen) Fiat (incl.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By XINHUA reporter Zhang Dongbo (1728 2639 3134) and </F> JIEFANGJUN BAO reporter Zhou Tao (0719 3447)]    [Text] Beijing, 17 Jun (XINHUA) -- An all-Army forum on  consolidating and reforming productive and management activities  was held in Beijing 13-17 June. Zhang Zhen, Central Military  Commission [CMC] vice chairman, addressed the forum, stressing  the need to follow the instructions of CMC chaiman Jiang Zemin,  as well as other relevant CMC instructions and decisions in  bringing into play the Army's fine traditions of serving the  people wholeheartedly and of consciously subordinating itself to  the overall interests, and in further promoting healthy  development of the Army's productive and management activities.  Fu Quanyou, CMC member and director of the General Logistics  Department, attended and spoke at the forum. CMC members Chi  Haotian and Yu Yongbo attended the meeting.    According to a briefing, the Army has scored notable results  in consolidating and reforming productive and management  activities: In the light of realities, all major units have  formulated concrete plans to actively and steadily implement the  CMC's guidelines on centralized management of enterprises; the  CMC's regulation banning combat troops from engaging in  productive and management activities has been gradually  enforced; Army-run coal mines in Shanxi have been transferred to  local authorities to the satisfaction of the state, the Army,  the local governments, and the masses of people; and all units  have persisted in promoting consolidation and reform on the one  hand, while stabilizing and developing production to avoid  drastic decreases in production efficiency on the other, thereby  giving a strong impetus to agricultural and sideline production  in all Army units.    In his speech, Zhang Zhen said: Consolidating and reforming  the Army's productive and management activities is a major  policy decision made by CMC in accordance with Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's concept of Army building in the new period. Chairman  Jiang Zemin made a series of important instructions regarding  the work. We must earnestly understand and unify our thinking,  based on the spirit of important instructions and the policy  decision, so as to more consciously and steadfastly implement  the CMC policy decision.    He emphasized: As the consolidation and reform of productive  and management activities involves major readjustments in  interest relationships, we must emphasize, in particular, the  sense of discipline. We should strengthen supervision and  inspection by bringing into play the role of discipline  inspection and auditing departments. He pointed out: To  successfully consolidate and reform productive and management  activities is a real test of high-level leading organs; it is  also an important aspect of the task of improving office and  leadership work style. In the next phase of consolidation and  reform work, the headquarters and all major units should pay  close attention to the consolidation and reform of their  productive and management activities, assigning principal  leaders to personally take charge of the work to ensure  consolidation and reform in each and every department. Office  and department leaders must take overall interests into account  and ensure the completion of consolidation and reform work  quantitatively and qualitatively.    In his speech, Fu Quanyou summarized the consolidation and  reform work in the productive and management activities of all  Army units in the early phase, and set forth specific tasks for  the next phase. He said: In the next phase, we should focus  attention on work in the following five areas: 1) conducting an  immediate inventory of the "dismantling, screening, suspending,  and standardizing" productive and management activities of Army  units stationed in some localities; 2) earnestly ensuring  readjustment of the organizational structure of all Army-run  enterprises; 3) further screening and consolidating productive  and management projects and setting a deadline by which all  those violating the regulation must correct themselves; 4)  striving to fulfill this year's productive tasks; and 5)  strictly conducting inspections and acceptance tests.    Leaders of the three general departments and responsible  comrades of all major units and the Army police headquarters  attended the forum.</p>

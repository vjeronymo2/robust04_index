			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Japanese banks bar cash for Pyongyang Some Japanese banks have stopped transferring dollars to North Korea, a move that highlights the growing sensitivity towards charges that money flowing from Japan is helping to support North Korea's nuclear programme. The finance ministry said yesterday it had been informed of the move by several banks, but emphasised that the action was purely voluntary. Japan has faced charges in the US and at home that money remitted to North Korea by Korean residents of Japan may be helping to fund the nuclear programme. The US has said, and Japan has acknowledged, that if the United Nations votes to impose economic sanctions on North Korea, the flow of funds from Japan would have to be dealt with. 'If there were problems with North Korea, or if there were to be sanctions, then we would look at remittances (of funds from Japan), the US embassy in Tokyo said yesterday. The finance ministry said it had not asked the banks to stop transferring funds to North Korea but that 'if the UN decided to impose sanctions, the government's policy is to take responsible action and that would have applied to money remittances, too.' Under current Japanese rules, however, there are no restrictions on sending money to North Korea and about 20 Japanese banks have arrangements with that country allowing them to transfer funds. The exact amount of money involved is not known. The Japanese authorities have refrained from taking any overt action to curb money transfers for fear of alienating Koreans in Japan with ties in the North. There is a 700,000-strong Korean community in Japan as a result of Japan's invasion earlier this century. Ashikaga Bank, which has been transferring funds to North Korea for its customers for at least 20 years, said it had stopped transferring dollars from other banks since the beginning of this year. The bank, located north of Tokyo, continues to transfer funds for its customers, as a service to them, it said. It was a 'business decision' to stop transferring funds from other banks.</p>

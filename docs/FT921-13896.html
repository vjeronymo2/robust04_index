			<p>920118 FT  18 JAN 92 / Travel: The peak of skiing perfection - There are few resorts anywhere that Arnold Wilson has not cruised, sped or fallen through. So we asked him to pick his ten favourites. This is his selection WHAT MAKES a ski resort special? Some would say spectacular, steep and challenging runs; others would go for exhilarating cruising runs or delightful nursery slopes. Others would insist on a picturesque village half-buried in a blanket of snow beneath a star-spangled sky - the quintessential Austrian hamlet, for example. Sensual apres ski - tribal gyrations in a frenetic, overtly sexual disco atmosphere - would be top of some holidaymakers' lists. In theory, a top resort should meet all these criteria. Few do, although some US resorts like Sun Valley, Vail, Taos and Jackson Hole have tried to establish a European-American melange with some success. The French resort of Val d'Isere, with its huge network of lifts, superb selection of blue and black runs, excellent off-piste powderfields, gullies and couloirs is, by common consent among good skiers, one of the greatest ski resorts in the world - many would say the best. And the nightlife throbs. But pretty it is not. Nor, to be fair, is it particularly ugly, but it is linked with Tignes, which is. On the other hand, there are several Austrian villages (Alpbach is a prime example) which epitomise Austrian charm and gemutlichkeit and have pleasant nursery skiing, although very little for experts. St Anton, however, has spectacular skiing and scenery, if nowhere near as much charm, unless you count its idyllic little satellite, St Christoph, cocooned in deep snow like a dish of profiteroles with too much cream. By contrast, Kitzbuhel has enormous charm when the atmosphere is not being shattered by rowdy and sometimes inebriated Scandinavians. This most attractive of towns has walled and cobbled streets, clustered gabled houses and colour-washed facades and arches. But it also has something of a snow problem. Built at a mere 800 metres, it is fortunate to get as much snow as it does (it is in a 'snow hole'). St Moritz may be a predictable selection, but it has an enormous choice of skiing with six distinct areas encompassing almost every kind of skiing terrain, from the warm, fairly gentle slopes of Corviglia to sterner stuff at Lagalb, Diavolezza and Corvatch, where steep runs and exotic scenery combine to produce the much sought-after skiing cocktail of physical and visual stimulation. The atmosphere in the town itself is also stimulating, but surprisingly unstuffy and friendly for a resort so steeped in the history of winter sports and so heavily infiltrated by generations of glitterati. You can study the affluent residents and guests quite cheaply from any number of tea-rooms, but you must sample at least one dinner at the Palace and another at the more reserved and more elderly Kulm with its countless glass cases packed with trophies from the celebrated Cresta run, which descends partly through the hotel grounds. Zermatt, with the Matterhorn, is another Swiss resort that cannot be excluded. There is hardly a mountain nation that does not seek to syphon off some of the Matterhorn's mystical allure by dubbing one of its own mountains 'our Matterhorn.' With three major ski areas spread about its perimeter, Zermatt has no shortage of excellent slopes, plus more mountain restaurants (about 30 last time I counted) than any ski resort in the Alps. The traffic-free main street lined with superb hotels such as the Mont Cervin, Monte Rosa, Zermatterhoff and Schweizerhof, has charm, elegance and luxury. Aficionados of Argentiere would be speechless if this cult resort were left out, although its appeal - it has beautiful and challenging off-piste skiing, some of it teetering on the very edge of the Argentiere glacier - is almost exclusively orientated towards strong skiers. The famous Pas de Chevre is a giant leap for a goat, never mind a skier. Although there are a few funky bars in the narrow, Wild West-style main street, most of the apres-ski is down the road at neighbouring Chamonix. Courchevel is another classic, with plenty of smart restaurants, shops and hairdressers: almost anything that you might seek in Paris has already been transported there. It also has a more-than-comprehensive network of lifts, beautifully groomed slopes and enough skiing to last a fortnight without even venturing into neighbouring Meribel, Les Menuires and Val Thorens. In North America, Jackson Hole scores heavily on all fronts, particularly scenery (the Teton range is quite startling, especially in contrast to the vast, flat valley floor) and exciting skiing (it does not get much steeper or more rugged in the Rockies). Although discos are out, there is great fun to be had in the town of Jackson, where wooden sidewalks and cowboy bars remind you of a score of Hollywood westerns. (One of the most famous, Shane, was shot locally). In the skiing area at Teton Village, the Mangy Moose is the big attraction. The unfortunate creature after which this establishment was named hangs, forlorn and stuffed, from the rafters, giving revellers an unseemly view of its undercarriage. The skiing at Jackson is outstanding, with wonderful cruising trails that are wide and steep. Fast skiers can beat Jackson's famous tram down from the top of Rendezvous Mountain if they can better 4,000 vertical feet in 12 minutes. There are innumerable chutes and gullys, plus the superb Hobacks - the steep, wide-ranging flanks of the mountain that can keep powder skiers in a frenzy for run after run. Telluride, a remote and atmospheric old town in south- west Colorado, evokes the old mining days like nowhere else in the US. In particular, Main Street, with its smoky Last Dollar Saloon, is un-nervingly unchanged since Butch Cassidy robbed the San Miguel Valley Bank 100 years ago. The skiing is sheer joy for intermediates and experts, with wide-open, steep runs cut through the trees, some outstanding off-piste and beautiful views. Aspen writes its own name in any list of Top Ten resorts. It is unique. The skiing, with some good fast cruising runs and some very tricky chutes, may not be quite the ultimate in the US, but if you add Aspen Highlands' wild ridges and Snowmass's more challenging terrain and long 'motorway' trails, you would be hard-pressed to beat it. Add in Aspen's 100 restaurants and glitzy mix of celebrities, colourful history and inspirational scenery and you have an outstanding resort. Apologies to Vail, but having only been conceived in the early 1960s it does not have Aspen's patina or cachet.</p>

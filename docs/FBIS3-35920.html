This equipment will enable Azerbaijan to switch over to the  communication system within the CSCE framework. This  communication system will provide direct, uninterrupted 24-hour  communication among the capitals of the CSCE-member states.    The UK Embassy states that this communication system makes  possible the exchange of information within the framework of the  Vienna agreement on the Reduction of Conventional Weapons in  Europe. The report also states that in contrast with offers to  the other CIS states, no other state offered assistance to  Azerbaijan in this matter. Taking this fact into consideration,  the UK decided to give this equipment to Azerbaijan.    The British equipment will be delivered to Baku and begin  functioning in the near future.</p>

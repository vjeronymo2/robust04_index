			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Another lean year predicted for base metals producers BASE METALS producers are in for another lean year and aggregate real prices will in 1992 be no more than 5 per cent above 1986 levels, suggests the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services consultancy group in its latest quarterly forecast report. MMRS expects a 'slow and tentative' recovery in economic growth this year so the rise in base metal consumption will be hesitant until the second half, it says. 'We doubt if the aggregate increase will exceed 2 per cent over the year as a whole.' Therefore the onus will be on metals producers to rein back output in order to prevent stock/consumption ratios rising considerably further. In 1991 there were voluntary cuts in production in all the main traded metals except copper, MMRS points out. 'In the coming months cuts will not only have to be maintained but also have to be added to. Even then we do not expect a build-up in stocks to be entirely prevented.' While there might well be a substantial recovery in metals prices, this 'merely reflects present distress.' Year-on-year price increases in 1992 will be 'very modest indeed.' However, only copper is forecast by MMRS to fall further in price this year. Average London Metal Exchange cash prices are forecast to be in the following ranges in 1992: aluminium, 60 cents to 70 cents a lb (60 cents in 1991); copper, 95 to 100 cents a lb (106 cents); lead, 25 to 29 cents (25 cents); nickel, 360 to 380 cents a lb (369 cents); tin, 265 to 276 cents a lb (249 cents); and zinc, 53 to 57 cents a lb (50-51 cents). MMRS says forecasting is particularly difficult at present because of the surge in metal sales from the former eastern bloc countries. This has had a big impact on prices because so much of the material ended up being highly visible in London Metal Exchange warehouses. 'Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that these flows will quickly abate. While the accelerating political break-up of the former Soviet Union makes any forecasting well nigh impossible, most of the same factors which led to the massive exports of the past two years, namely domestic demand collapsing faster than production and the desperate need for foreign exchange, will remain in place,' says MMRS. 'Neither is metal consumption in countries of eastern Europe likely to pick up in the short term. East-west trade flows will therefore almost certainly remain a bearish influence in 1992.' MMRS suggests all three precious metals are set to claw back some of their recent price falls in 1992. But in the absence of the external ingredients for a bull market, investor interest will be slow to be rekindled. Price gains are likely to be modest. It forecasts gold will average between Dollars 350 and Dollars 400 a troy ounce in 1992 (Dollars 360 and Dollars 365 in 1991); platinum will average Dollars 370 to Dollars 410 a troy ounce (Dollars 370-Dollars 380); and silver will average Dollars Dollars 4.25-Dollars 4.75 a troy ounce (Dollars 4.03-4.07).

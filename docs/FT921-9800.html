			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / By-election blow for Japan's Miyazawa Opposition parties joined forces to defeat Japan's ruling party in a closely watched upper house by-election yesterday, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The defeat dealt a heavy blow to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's scandal-plagued government. The by-election, the first national poll since Mr Miyazawa took office in November, was seen as a test of public confidence in the new government ahead of upper house elections due in July. The LDP's defeat came after almost daily disclosures of political scandals involving close aides of Miyazawa.</p>

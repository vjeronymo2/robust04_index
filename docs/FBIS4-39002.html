			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of the decree "On the Sale of State Debtor </F> Enterprises" signed by Russian Federation President Boris  Yeltsin on 2 June; by ITAR-TASS]    [Text] Moscow, 3 Jun  <H5>  On the Sale of State Debtor Enterprises </H5>   With a view to implementing state policy aimed at preventing  the insolvency (bankruptcy) of enterprises and the negative  social consequences connected with the reorganization and  liquidation of insolvent enterprises, should they be declared  insolvent (bankrupt), I decree:    1. State enterprises whose accounts balance have been  declared unsatisfactory and an enterprise that has been declared  insolvent (this is known henceforth as the debtor enterprise),  in accordance with Resolution No. 498 of the Government of the  Russian Federation of 20 May 1994 "On Measures to Implement  Legislative Acts on Insolvency (Bankruptcy)", should be sold in  accordance with this decree.    2. The accompanying provision on the procedure for selling  state debtor enterprises should be approved.    The provision on the procedure for selling state debtor  enterprises should be applied to: state-owned debtor  enterprises for which a privatization plan has not been approved  according to established procedures by the time the decision is  adopted on their accounts balance being unsatisfactory and the  enterprises being insolvent; and, to the packages of the debtor  enterprises' shares that belong to the state.    3. The sale of state debtor enterprises that are declared  bankrupt should be accomplished in the following ways:    --by sale through competitive bidding, on a commercial or  investment basis, of debtor enterprises that will maintain their  status as legal entities;    --by the liquidation of debtor enterprises with the  subsequent sale of their property (assets) at auctions or  through competitive bidding, on a commercial or investment basis;    --by selling at auction the state-owned portions of the  stock  (shares) of debtor enterprises.    4. If insolvency of state-owned enterprises is caused by  circumstances that are not immediately connected with a delayed  payment of a state order from the federal budget or from the  budget of a member of the Russian Federation, the head of the  enterprise who, being considered unfit for his position, should  be deemed responsible for the insolvency of the enterprise.    As soon as an enterprise is declared insolvent and having an  unsatisfactory accounts balance, the rights to sign and cancel  contracts with the head of the debtor enterprise are transferred  to the Federal Department for Insolvency (bankruptcy) under the  State Committee of the Russian Federation for Management of  State Property or to an appropriate executive body of a member  of the Russian Federation.    The question of relieving the head of the debtor enterprise  of his duties, as unfit for his position, will be considered  simultaneously with making the decision to declare a state-owned  enterprise insolvent and as having an unsatisfactory accounts  balance.    In the event that the head of a debtor enterprise is  relieved  from his duties, there will be no new appointment, but the  Federal Department for Insolvency (bankruptcy) under the State  Committee of the Russian Federation for Management of State  Property or an appropriate executive body of a member of the  Russian Federation will conclude an agreement with an individual  (the manager), subcontracting the management of the debtor  enterprise until it has been sold to a new owner.    5. When preparing plans for the privatization of  enterprises, the Russian Federation State Committee for the  Management of State Property and property management committees  in components [subyekty] of the Russian Federation should  analyze the financial condition of enterprises in accordance  with the criteria approved by the Russian Federation Government  for determining an unsatisfactory balance structure.    6. The sale of debtor enterprises around which new towns  have been created should be carried out in accordance with the  special rules set by the Russian Federation Government.    The Russian Federation Government is to approve within two  months a provision on the procedure for classifying enterprises  as enterprises around which new towns have been created and the  special rules for the sale of debtor enterprises around which  new towns have been created.    7. The Russian Federation government should:    --speed up the preparation of a draft law establishing the  criminal and administrative responsibility of the management of  an enterprise for actions causing the enterprise to go bankrupt;    --approve within one month the norms for the distribution of  resources obtained from the sale of debtor enterprises and of  their property (assets) and stock (shares), in accordance with  the ways in which they are used, which have been defined by the  provision on the procedure for the sale of state-owned debtor  enterprises.    8. Local government bodies should be recommended to carry  out the sale of municipally owned debtor enterprises in  accordance with the rules stipulated by the provision on the  procedure for the sale of state-owned debtor enterprises.    The present decree comes into force from the moment of its  publication.    [signed] Boris Yeltsin</p>

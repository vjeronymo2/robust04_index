			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Correspondent Aleksandr Chernykh report: "Poor Little Rich </F> Man -- the Nuclear Version"]    [Text] Tomsk -- This winter rumors spread around Tomsk  that the Siberian chemical combine in Seversk (Tomsk-7) could be  shut down. In particular, that coal reserves had reached a  critical level because of the financial crisis.    At a press conference combine director G. Khandorin did not  rule out the possibility that the enterprise could be shut down.  Although he naturally expressed the hope that the government  would not allow this. Otherwise a social explosion would  follow, because one-fifth of the city's inhabitants are directly  employed at the combine. Counting their families, the number  increases about threefold. The main thing is that over one-half  of the local budget comes from payments and taxes received from  the combine.    The combine's specialists believe that even a brief closure  will have unpredictable consequences, and economic computations  show that ensuring the safety of a closed combine is in no way  cheaper than the cost of operating it.    All these arguments were set out in a letter addressed to  Head of Government V.S. Chernomyrdin. It was signed by atomic  energy first deputy minister Konovalov and oblast administration  head Kress. Tomsk inhabitants are requesting financial support.  Not the one-shot kind but support in the form of regular  credits, and even at the usual rather than a preferential  interest rate.    Someone might protest here: Russia's entire economy is in  crisis and the budget deficit is enormous, yet nuclear power  workers are asking for credit, and regular creditat that. But  the whole paradox is that the Siberian chemical combine is a  profitable enterprise. A fact, strange as it may seem. Even  though in the first quarter the combine received 22 billion  rubles [R] less than it should have. The "Tomskenergo"  joint-stock company failed to pay a debt of around R8 billion.  In turn the combine owed R17.4 billion for fuel for the AES  [nuclear electric power station) and for coal for the TETS  [thermal power station].    Yet the nuclear power workers say confidently that they will  settle up with everybody at the end of the year. The letter to  the government says unequivocally that all credits will be  repaid with guaranteed interest. A profit of R150 billion is  even planned by the end of the year. This can be explained very  simply: The Siberian chemical combine has reliable partners in  distant foreign countries.    "The point is that Western partners pay only in two  instalments," Yu. Samarin, the combine's deputy economics  director, explains. "Once immediately prior to the moment when  a contract starts to be implemented, and the second time when  the final settlement is made. So it turns out that we have a  positive balance for only three to four months a year. But on  the whole we are in credit for the year. Even though money to  acquire fuel and materials is needed every month."    The Siberian chemical combine finds itself in the role of a  poor little rich man. This will continue until the nonpayments  crisis is eradicated and until a mutual settlement system which  operates efficiently has been established. But until these  times of plenty arrive the nuclear power workers need regular  credits. Chernomyrdin responded to the letter positively. It  has been passed to the relevant authorities with an appropriate  resolution. There could still be slip-ups at this stage of  agreements and settlements. The Finance Ministry is quite  capable of making a negative finding. There is no spare money  in the budget. Yet this is a special case. Both nuclear safety  and the interests of an oblast of a million people must be borne  in mind. The main thing is that it is not just another  bottomless pit where credits disappear, never to return. As the  saying goes, the product is guaranteed.</p>

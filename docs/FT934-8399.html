			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Sainsbury considers action against Shell J. SAINSBURY, Britain's largest food retailer, is considering legal action against Shell over advertisements by the oil company which claim that petrol sold by supermarkets can damage car engines. Sainsbury said the advertisements, carried in several national newspapers yesterday, wrongly suggested that petrol sold by supermarkets was inferior. The advertisements quote a recent article in The Times, which said a comparative test had found that supermarket petrol led to a bigger build-up of carbon on engine inlet valves than did Shell's 'Advanced' brand of fuel. Although the article in The Times said the test had been carried out at the newspaper's request by Ricardo Consulting Engineering, an automotive consultancy, Shell conceded yesterday that it had arranged and paid for the test. It did not think it necessary to mention this in the advertisements. Although the advertisements do not name Sainsbury, the retailer said they were unfair because they implied that its petrol did not contain detergents designed to reduce carbon deposits and engine wear. Sainsbury said it had been selling petrol that contained detergents at 80 of its 130 supermarket service stations for the past week, and would soon be doing so at all sites. It had decided to do so after the car industry had told it that detergents could improve engine performance. Sainsbury said it was objecting to Shell and was 'considering its options'. These included legal action and lodging a complaint with the Advertising Standards Authority.</p>

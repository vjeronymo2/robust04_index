			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Ukraine threatens to split CIS in row with Russia THE prospect of a break-up of the Commonwealth of Independent States came closer yesterday after Ukraine stepped up its conflict with Russia over the Crimea. An adviser to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk said Russia would be asked for guarantees that it would not claim Ukrainian territory at the Ukrainian-Russian summit next week. Professor Mykola Mykhalchenko warned that Russian failure to agree to Ukraine's demands - particularly acute because of the Russian parliament's claim to Ukraine's lush Crimean peninsula - could precipitate the break-up of the CIS. Ukraine also hopes to resolve the row over division of the Black Sea fleet and will seek agreement with Russia on deported people which would enable the Crimean Tatars to return home. 'Ukraine cannot be a member of an association together with another state which has claims on its territory,' Professor Mykhalchenko said. Prof Mykhalchenko said it was unlikely Russia would accede to Ukraine's terms, and that Ukraine may try to force Russia out of the CIS on the grounds that it is threatening other member states. Ukraine is unlikely to succeed in this but it has enough allies in the CIS, such as Azerbaijan, to cause a big rift. Prof Mykhalchenko said the meeting at the Russian Black Sea resort of Dagomys was Russia's last chance to acknowledge Ukrainian sovereignty and show that 'we, the Ukrainians, are not the ones who are souring relations.' His comments suggest Ukrainian politicians are proving immune to Russian efforts to apply economic pressure. According to Ukrainian economic experts, last week in Moscow Russian negotiators said that Russia would charge world prices for oil the moment Ukraine introduces a separate currency and leaves the rouble zone. This could be devastating for Ukraine, heavily dependent on Russian subsidised oil, but in Paris this week Mr Kravchuk said Ukraine would introduce a separate currency, the hryvnia, in August or September. At Dagomys Ukraine will seek an agreement on prices and the introduction of the hryvnia and a formula for dividing the former Soviet Union's debts and assets. Prof Mykhalchenko said failure to agree 'could have very negative effects on relations'.</p>

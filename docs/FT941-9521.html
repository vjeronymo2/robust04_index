			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Germany faces a strike nobody wants: Damaging stoppage looms after collapse of pay talks The failure last Friday night of top-level talks between the leaders of Germany's engineering workers and their employers has put the rhetoric of strike - and lock-out - back in the headlines. The two sides now have slightly less than three weeks in which to head off the threat of an all-out strike in one of Germany's main industrial regions  -a strike which nobody wants, and which undoubtedly would be damaging to an industry already in the throes of its steepest recession since the war. Both sides stormed out of the talks in Darmstadt on Friday blaming the other for inflexibility and a refusal to negotiate. Neither side is ready to be first to propose new talks. Both say a strike is increasingly inevitable, and the employers are threatening to match strike action with lock-outs. Yet Germany's cautious labour laws, and the precise framework of the annual wage round, mean that the process is not that easy or quick to put into effect. Moreover, new labour legislation means that a strike could prove considerably more painful, even for a union as wealthy as IG Metall, than it used to be. It is now up to the 14 regional wage negotiating commissions of IG Metall, the 3.2m-strong engineering workers' union, formally to decide that negotiations have failed, and that they want to hold strike ballots. The entire wage negotiating process is decentralised, even though the final agreement is usually the same for all of the regions. That process will take the rest of this week - disrupted already by the celebration of the annual pre-Lent carnival in large centres such as Cologne, Dusseldorf and Mainz. The regional decisions must reach union headquarters in Frankfurt by next Monday, February 21. That is the deadline set by IG Metall's national executive to decide on holding a strike ballot, which in turn will take several days to organise, and at least two days to conduct. Thus it will only be by the first week of March that the union is ready to call full-scale strike action, and even then it will only be in one region: a national strike would rapidly exhaust union strike funds. The region will probably be either North Rhine-Westphalia, the traditional centre of heavy industry where the employers are set to be most militant, or Baden-Wurttemberg, the home of Daimler-Benz and Robert Bosch, among the blue-chip industrial employers. That should give time enough for both sides, in spite of their hardline rhetoric, to have one more attempt at compromise. IG Metall says it is ready to meet for more talks at any time, and at any level. Given the failure of the national leaders to find a solution on Friday, it seems likely they will try at regional level next time round. Mr Klaus Zwickel, the union leader, has also warned his members about the unpleasant consequences of a change in the employment promotion act agreed by parliament last year. In future, union members who are not on strike, but who are put on short-time working, or laid off, as a result of strike action by their own union, will not qualify for any unemployment benefit. Mr Zwickel made it clear last week that IG Metall had not got the resources to pay such workers strike benefits either. It means that the union will have to choose its strategy even more carefully than in previous years, in order to maximise the immediate effects of the action, and minimise its secondary effects. Few doubt the solidarity of the IG Metall membership, if the leadership calls clearly for strike action. But it is also obvious that few members are enthusiastic, either. There is a widespread suspicion that many employers may actually welcome an enforced period of closure, at a time of flagging demand throughout the engineering sector. Moreover, the union lacks an easy wage claim on which to seek strike backing: the current claim, for 5.5 to 6 per cent, has already been abandoned in all but name. The leadership has made clear it will settle for a nominal rise, provided it is not an outright pay freeze. Now the slogan is 'job protection' and 'income protection' with the emphasis on the former. It may prove more difficult to persuade the membership that the best way to protect their jobs is to go on strike. That is the gamble the employers are taking, in pushing the union to the brink of open warfare. Editorial comment, Page 17</p>

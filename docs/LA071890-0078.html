			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CZECH EMBASSY STANDOFF IN HAVANA ENDS BUT OTHER CUBANS SEEK ASYLUM  </P> <P> A fresh group of Cubans sought political asylum at other foreign embassies in  Havana on Tuesday only hours after a weeklong standoff at the Czechoslovak  Embassy ended with the surrender of 12 refugees.  </P> <P> Four young Cubans climbed onto the roof of the Italian ambassador's residence  Tuesday and asked for political asylum, an Italian Embassy spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Earlier, Cuban police seized and dragged away a Cuban who tried to enter the  U.S. Interests Section. The section protested to Cuban authorities about the  incident.  </P> <P> In another development, a family of four Cubans pushed their way into the  consular section of the Spanish Embassy and demanded visas, diplomatic sources  said, but they were persuaded to leave and apply for their visas normally. The  couple and two children already had valid Cuban passports and authorization to  leave the country. Three Cubans are being sheltered at the embassy.  </P> <P> The new incidents came a day after 12 Cuban refugees surrendered  unconditionally and left the Czechoslovak Embassy after fighting among  themselves and holding five Czechoslovak diplomats hostage for more than five  hours.  </P> <P> Five Cubans are occupying the house of a Czechoslovak diplomat but have been  refused diplomatic protection.  </P></p>

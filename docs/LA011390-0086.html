Burton Bathke, 41, was sentenced this week by  Monterey County Superior Court Judge Richard Silver.  </P> <P> A jury had convicted him of 18 felony counts, including kidnaping, rape and  false imprisonment. Bathke claimed that his victim lied about her time with him  from Aug. 26 to Sept. 1, 1988. He said she was left alone at times when she  could have escaped, that she went dining with him at restaurants, went shopping  and did household chores, including feeding his cat. Bathke released her with a  promise of clothes, money and a car if she didn't tell anyone. She went  straight to the police.  </P></p>

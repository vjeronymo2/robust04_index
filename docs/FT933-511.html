			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Poles build centre-left coalition PROSPECTS for a centre-left government in Poland improved yesterday as the leaders of the two parties to emerge with the biggest share of the vote in the September 19 election signed an 'initial' agreement on forming a coalition government. The agreement followed a meeting between Mr Alexander Kwasniewski, head of the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), which has 171 out of 460 seats in the new parliament, and Mr Waldemar Pawlak, the leader of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL), which controls 132 seats. Both groups have their roots in the communist past when the Polish United Workers' Party, the SLD's predecessor, governed the country and the PSL collaborated to survive. A statement issued by the SLD spoke of a PSL-SLD coalition, with the order of the parties suggesting that Mr Pawlak was the likely candidate for the post of prime minister in the next government. Mr Pawlak, 34, won wide respect when he was prime minister for one month in 1992, but failed to put together a coalition. His party still has most of its support in the countryside. However, SLD spokesmen yesterday refused to comment on who would be the leader and said that their party would talk to President Lech Walesa about the issue. The SLD has written to Mr Walesa to ask for a meeting at which it will report on its talks with the PSL. Constitutionally, it is up to the president to ask a representative of one of the parties in the new parliament to form a government. The third prospective partner, the left-leaning Labour Union (UP), with its beginnings in the Solidarity movement and which has 41 seats in the new parliament, announced it would not enter an SLD-led government. The agreement leaves the Democratic Union (UD), a mainstream Solidarity grouping with 74 seats, in opposition. The PSL is interested in having a say over the key economic ministries and not just being relegated to those areas of government which impinge on the rural population. Thus Mr Pawlak has already said that the finance, foreign trade and labour ministries are regarded as the key posts. His party will also be eyeing the industry portfolio, which the PSL wants to merge with the privatisation ministry. Poland has been led by centrist coalition governments since the Solidarity movement swept away communist rule in 1989 and their tough market reforms have started to pull the country out of recession. However, many Poles have become disillusioned with reforms that have sent real wages plummeting and pushed unemployment above 15 per cent. Both the SLD and the PSL support free market reforms but independent economists expect them to advance with reforms more slowly than previous governments.</p>

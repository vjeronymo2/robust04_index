			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ISRAELIS MAY BOOST DEFENSE SPENDING  </P> <P> Finance Minister Shimon Peres asked Israel's Cabinet on Sunday to approve a  $27.2-billion state budget for 1990 that would put more money into battling the  Palestinian uprising.  </P> <P> The Cabinet met for seven hours and will discuss the draft budget again today  before voting on the proposal and sending it to Parliament.  </P> <P> The Finance Ministry proposed defense spending of $5.3 billion, an increase of  $75 million over the current budget and nearly 20% of all spending for the  fiscal year starting April 1, 1990.  </P> <P> The army had sought an extra $200 million, saying this was needed to meet the  costs of fighting the 2-year-old revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied  West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The proposed budget also includes a $250-million provision for settling 40,000  Jews expected to arrive in Israel next year, mostly from the Soviet Union.  Value-added tax will be raised to 16% from 15% to finance the new expenditure,  the Finance Ministry said.  </P> <P> The planned budget deficit will be $1.25 billion, regarded by many experts as  inflationary.  </P> <P> Peres, leader of the Labor Party, engineered a cost-cutting budget last year,  but failed to deliver on a promise to reduce inflation, now running at an  annual rate of 20%.  </P> <P> Sunday, he vowed that in 1990 he will bring the inflation rate down to less  than 10%.  </P></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / People: Morton and Foley aim to build up Baris Bob Morton and John Foley have emerged at the controls of Baris Holdings, the troubled loss-making building materials group which specialises in fire protection and dry lining. Morton, a Midlands financier with a taste for buying into sick companies and nursing them back to health, has become non-executive chairman of the Nottinghamshire group and called in Foley to be chief executive. Foley had been biding his time for a new job since September when he came to an amiable parting of the ways with Triplex Lloyd, the West Midlands engineer. Morton fireproofed Baris's ailing finances by buying into a rights issue, persuading National Westminster Bank to convert debt into equity and, with Foley, trawling round the London institutions to persuade them to support a share placing. Foley's first job is to overcome the Pounds 3.1m pretax loss in the year to last February. His second is expansion. With 300 employees, Baris is down to the core business after unhappy excursions in Germany, Spain and a lengthy dispute with Wimpey about a contract for the Little Britain development in the City of London. 'It was quite a good business,' says Foley. Robert Smith, the former chairman and chief executive, remains on the board as an executive director.</p>

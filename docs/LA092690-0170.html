			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CAPSULE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'IDOMENEO' ACCORDING TO SENDAK AND CORSARO  </P> <P> Here we go again.  </P> <P> The wonders of a great opera are compromised by the gimmickry of a meddlesome  director and designer. The problem becomes especially irksome when the music is  sensitively conducted, exquisitely sung and elegantly played.  </P> <P> Take, for sad example, Mozart's "Idomeneo" as staged by Frank Corsaro,  illustrated by Maurice Sendak and conducted by Roderick Brydon for the Music  Center Opera on Tuesday.  </P> <P> If our records are accurate, Los Angeles had never before seen a major staging  of the lofty opera seria. Los Angeles still hasn't seen a faithful  representation of this stylized exploration of jealousy, devotion, heroism and  renunciation on the island of Crete in the wake of the Trojan War.  </P> <P> Corsaro decided that the idiom needed to be juiced up. Forget classic nobility.  Let's have a psychosexual charade.  </P> <P> Idomeneo, the king of Crete, was really Leopold Mozart, the composer's  overbearing father. That was Corsaro's irrelevant concept. Idamante, the  troubled prince, was really Mozart himself. The opera, we were told, really  concerns the complex love-hate relationship between the paternal despot and the  youthful pretender to his aesthetic throne.  </P> <P> Everyone loves Maurice Sendak. He is a master of dark-edged humor, and his  magical images cast their spell far beyond children's books. With "Idomeneo,"  however, he seems to have strayed into the wrong scenic milieu.  </P> <P> In many ways, this "Idomeneo" is best appreciated with eyes closed. Roderick  Brydon, who has replaced the originally scheduled Christof Perick, conducts  with tender, lyrical, reasonably stylish care. The cast functioned as an  ensemble of virtuosos. Siegfried Jerusalem, the most celebrated Wagnerian tenor  of the day, brought manly dignity, ample agility, dynamic finesse and burnished  tone -- some passing pitch problems notwithstanding -- to the title role. Susan  Quittmeyer complemented him -- and Corsaro's directorial conceit, too -- as an  Idamante of tremendous suavity and sensitivity. She has become a trouser-role  specialist with few peers.  </P> <P> Pamela Coburn looked a bit robust for the sweet-ingenue platitudes of Ilia, but  she sang with limpid, angelic tone. Although her soprano isn't as dark or as  heavy as cliche might have it in this evil role, Christine Weidinger swept all  before her with an Elettra of galvanizing passion and stunning vocal bravura.  </P></p>

			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Rao strengthens stance after Punjab poll wins INDIAN Prime Minister PV Narasimha Rao, has strengthened the position of his Congress minority government after winning 12 of the 13 parliamentary seats in Punjab, taking its tally in parliament to 244 in a house of 544. The party is still in a minority but can count on the votes of 16 allies to takes its support to 260. This leaves it short of a majority by 13 seats but it is supported by some members of the split Janata Dal and others. This will enable Mr Rao to face parliament in its budget session on Monday with more confidence than before the Punjab election. Dr Manmohan Singh, his minister of finance, is expected to present an austere budget on February 29. Mr Rao's economic reforms and liberalisation programme have been severely criticised by his opponents in other parties and from within Congress.</p>

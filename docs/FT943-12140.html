			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Radicals try to shatter Mideast peace process: Israelis see growing threat from Iran and extremist groups It seems no coincidence that yesterday's bomb attack on the Israeli embassy in London - and the blast early today in North Finchley - came soon after Israel and Jordan signed an historic peace accord in Washington. Despite the handshakes and near euphoria of Israeli and Jordanian leaders in Washington, the Middle East remains explosive. The peace process, far from subduing Islamic fundamentalism, has spurred Moslem radicals on - for fear they will become marginalised. They are aware this means striking not only at Israel but also at moderate Arabs such as the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. As a result, the peace process remains fragile and largely dependent on the political survival of such men as Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's King Hussein and PLO chief Yassir Arafat. Israeli officials believe the embassy bombing in London may be linked to bomb attacks earlier this month in Buenos Aires and Panama. In the Argentine city, a car bomb ripped apart a Jewish cultural centre and killed at least 96 people. In Panama, 21 people, mostly Jewish businessmen, died when their small aircraft blew up on a local flight. The Israelis claim the bombings were part of a well planned effort by Iran, and the Islamic groups it supports, to avoid being isolated by an emerging alliance in favour of Middle East peace. Israel has long wanted to see a new alliance emerge in the Middle East to oppose Iran and its export of fundamentalism. The Israelis have pursued peace in the past two years partly because they fear that, by waiting, they could face Islamic regimes less willing to compromise. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, yesterday warned against 'extreme Islamic radical terrorist movements', with infrastructure throughout the world, following the radical teaching of Ayatollah Khomeini, the late Iranian religious leader. Mr Rabin described the threat as 'Khomeinism without Khomeini'. Moderate Arab governments, Israel and western states were all at risk, he claimed. A detailed picture of how such extremist groups operate is lacking. But Israeli security officials believe they draw on a considerable network of contacts and cells abroad. They train at bases in Iran, Pakistan and the south of Lebanon, a stronghold of the Iranian-backed Hizbollah (Party of God), the Israelis claim. A Lebanese group called Ansar Allah, Followers of God, claimed responsibility for the Argentinian blast. Israeli officials also believe that, while many of the groups operate independently, they are bound together by a religious philosophy that opposes western decadence and seeks to establish Islamic republics throughout the Moslem world. The groups are opposed to the Middle East peace process and to moderate secular Arab leaders. They want to see the state of Israel destroyed. They draw support from students and professional groups, attracting young people with the lure of martyrdom. The Hamas Islamic Resistance Movement is one such group operating in the Palestinian self-ruled areas and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israeli officials accuse Syria of continuing to allow extremists to operate from Damascus. They claim President Hafez al-Assad could do much more to halt Hizbollah and other Islamic groups. Israel says Mr Assad is pursuing a two-track policy - using violence to force concessions in peace talks. Israeli officials said the spate of bombings coincided with a renewed wave of anti-Israeli activity by Hizbollah gunmen in south Lebanon. On Monday, Hizbollah mounted a series of attacks on Israeli positions inside Israel's security zone in south Lebanon, killing an Israeli officer and seriously injuring another. 'It's all part of one connection in the struggle against Israel, compounded by the desire to stop the peace process,' said Reserve General Shlomo Gazit, former army intelligence chief. Ten Palestinian groups opposed to the Israeli-PLO peace process are based in Damascus, including Mr Ahmed Jibril's faction, which has threatened to assassinate Mr Arafat. Several of the groups yesterday condemned the Israeli-Jordanian accord as a crime, marking a 'black day of mourning'. While these groups are responsible for some violent attacks, they are divided between secularists and Islamists and their alliance is regarded as short-term. As the Middle East peace efforts continue, a battle against extremism is likely to intensify.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Abarinov report under the "Power" rubric: "The </F> Declaration of Rights of a Self-Respecting State. Russia Is  Intent on Pursuing its Legitimate Interests `Firmly and  Resolutely'"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The foreign policy section of  President Yeltsin's message did not contain any surprises for  specialists. It was but the quintessence of concepts and  formulas that have been road-tested by Russian diplomats at  various international forums for some time now. Such as, for  instance, the European security and partnership concept, which  has just been announced by Andrey Kozyrev in Krakow. Provisions  interpreting regional policy principles have also been basically  well known. In this sense, the section is not "portentous."    What is striking in it in the first place is the absence in  the paragraph devoted to the Balkan crisis of the proposal for a  summit of the Group of Five to be convened, a proposal that the  Russian president put forward as recently as this week.  Presumably, facing an obstructionist stance by its Western  partners, Moscow thought it prudent not to press the issue. The  other day, your SEGODNYA correspondent happened to hear a  conversation between two high-ranking officials from the Foreign  Ministry and the presidential administration. The former told  his interlocutor that representatives of a number of European  countries have been bewildered by the format of the proposed  summit: Russia, after all, wants to join the Group of Seven,  not the Group of Five. The diplomat suggested that the question  of format be left open. So, it cannot be ruled out that the  Russian initiative will be repackaged so that it will boil down  to the discussion of the Bosnian settlement within the framework  of the Group of Seven meeting in Naples.

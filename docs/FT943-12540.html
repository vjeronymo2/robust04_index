			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Transport 'to top pollution league' Transport will overtake power generation as the sector emitting the greatest amount of carbon dioxide by the end of this decade. Yet demand for transport fuel will slow if the government sticks to its target of raising road-fuel duties by 5 per cent in real terms every year. These are the main conclusions of a study of energy and the environment by Cambridge Econometrics, the Cambridge-based consultancy. The study found that while emissions from power generation will decline in the years ahead, those from transport will continue to rise - particularly from road transport which accounts for more than 90 per cent of all transport emissions. But the rate of increase will slow. The study challenges the traditional assumption that motorists readily absorb higher petrol prices. It says new evidence suggests 'a much stronger long-run response to price increases than previously estimated'. One reason is that carmakers are now able to deliver greater efficiency benefits to motorists who want to cut their petrol bills. UK Energy and the Environment.

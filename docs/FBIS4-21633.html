			<p>BFN     [Text] DIPOS [expansion unknown] trustee Benjamin Garcia  Posse has signed an agreement with the National Commission for  Atomic Energy (CNEA) for the construction of a Sewage Waste  Irradiation Plant (PIBA) [Planta de Irradiacion de Barros  Cloacales]. The project will seek to solve the city's waste  recycling problem, guaranteeing its rational, safe, economic,  and harmless return to the environment.    CNEA will provide the funds, engineering, direction,  construction, and installation for the plants, as well as the  radioactive material (Cobalt 60) and the training of the  personnel who will operate the plant. The plant's construction  will be made to coincide with the construction of the Sewage  Disposal Plant in San Felipe.    The contract was signed by Roberto Oscar Marques, CNEA  radioisotopes and radiation area manager, on behalf of the  atomic agency. Engineer Jorge Guillermo Graino also attended.  During the ceremony at DIPOS, CNEA experts and officials  exchanged ideas on the project.    The contract establishes that CNEA will intervene and  supervise the installation's security as well as any operation  involving the movement of radioactive materials inside and  outside of the plant.    Operation periods will not exceed 10 years. In the 11th year  the ownership of PIBA will be transferred to DIPOS.    The treatment consists of forcing the "sludge" around a  cobalt-60 radioactive source carrier installed in an irradiator,  which is a bunker built eight meters underground with concrete  walls 1.4 meters thick acting as armor against radiation.    Once the sludge is pasteurized it will go into a tank for  bacteriological and radiation control. Here routine controls  will check whether the sludge is harmless.</p>

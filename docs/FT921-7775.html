			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Supergun' warnings given before seizure BRITISH intelligence received two separate warnings about the Iraqi 'supergun' project six months before British-made components for the gun were seized, MPs heard yesterday. Mr Stephan Kock, former non-executive director of the British defence group Astra Holdings, told the Commons trade and industry committee that he had notified the security services in September 1989. He learned of contracts to supply propellants for the supergun during a visit to PRB, the Belgian munitions company which Astra had recently acquired. Mr Kock said he informed intelligence contacts by telephone on September 22 and met them in London on October 11. Mr Gerald James, then Astra's chairman, and Mr Christopher Gumbley, chief executive, previously believed to have been the first to raise the alarm about the supergun, were unaware of Mr Kock's actions. They met Ministry of Defence officials, also believed to have links with the security services, on October 26. The MoD has written to the committee rejecting a request for the two officials involved to give evidence, on the grounds that both have 'retired'. A week after steel tubes intended to form part of the supergun were seized at Teesport in April 1990 Mr Nicholas Ridley, then trade and industry secretary, told parliament that the government only 'recently became aware in general terms' of the Iraqi project. Mr Kock was first named last year as a former consultant with Midland Bank's secretive defence equipment financing department in a Financial Times investigation which detailed links between some Midland executives and the intelligence community. While a career in the RAF, the special forces, and military intelligence in Rhodesia had left him with extensive intelligence connections, Mr Kock said yesterday that he had never worked as an MI6 officer. He also denied any link between his work for Midland and his Astra role, and allegations that he had known earlier of the PRB propellants orders and visited Iraq to arrange financing by Midland. He confirmed that he had fired a handgun into the air in an incident in 1990 near his home in Argyll. He denied, however, that his solicitor had said at a subsequent court hearing that Mr Kock's defence work had left him with an acute concern for his personal safety. Earlier, Mr Christopher Gumbley talked publicly for the first time about a meeting on March 22 1990 with Dr Gerald Bull, the Canadian scientist who headed the supergun project, only hours before Dr Bull was shot by an assassin. Mr Gumbley, who had been arrested the previous week by Ministry of Defence police on corruption charges, told MPs Dr Bull said he believed Mr Gumbley was being 'set up' by the British government and PRB's former parent, Societe Generale de Belgique, and offered to fund his defence. 'He said my arrest by the MoD police was an engineered manoeuvre, carried out to discredit me and cause me to have to resign from Astra,' Mr Gumbley said.</p>

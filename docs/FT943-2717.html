			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Banks' fees Are financial advisers fleecing their most vulnerable corporate clients? The question has been raised twice this week. In the first instance, Lasmo revealed it had paid financial advisers Pounds 16m to fend off a hostile Pounds 1.6bn bid from rival oil explorer Enterprise. In the second, Queens Moat Houses, the struggling hotel group, announced that provisions for restructuring its Pounds 1.3bn in debt had been raised to Pounds 42m. Some of that has been earmarked to pay fees for a new borrowing facility. In Queens Moat's case, the scope for exploitation is clear. Its bankers were in a position to dictate terms for the borrowing facility. If Queens Moat did not like them, the banks could have forced it into receivership. The Lasmo case is less clear-cut. Theoretically, it could have shopped around to find a cheaper set of advisers. But in practice, managers on the receiving end of a hostile bid rarely concentrate on negotiating lower fees. Their priority is to beat off the predator. Of course, just because there is scope for exploitation does not mean it has actually occurred in either case. The sums look high, but it is possible advisers have provided value for money by rescuing Lasmo from takeover and Queens Moat from receivership. The only way to know would be if much greater detail was disclosed by companies in such vulnerable situations about their contracts with bankers. Ideally, this should happen in good time for shareholder objections to be aired. Bankers might still seek multi-million pound fees but they would have to justify them in public.</p>

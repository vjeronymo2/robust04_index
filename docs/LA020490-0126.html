			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 4-LANE HIGHWAY WILL CUT INTO DOVER'S WHITE CLIFFS; CONSERVATION GROUPS ANGRY  </P> <P> Fifty years after Adolf Hitler's armies threatened to destroy them, England's  famous White Cliffs of Dover are in danger again -- from a road.  </P> <P> Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson and Environment Secretary Chris Patten  decided a four-lane highway should run along the famous cliffs, at one point  just 200 yards from the edge.  </P> <P> The highway is intended to improve access from Dover to the entrance of the  Channel Tunnel, linking France and Britain, which is due to open in 1993.  </P> <P> The two ministers turned down plans for an alternate route farther inland  because it would have cost an extra $17.6 million.  </P> <P> The chalk-white cliffs on Britain's southern coast can be seen for miles from  the English Channel. The rolling grassy countryside above the cliffs is favored  by hikers.  </P> <P> Conservation groups were angered.  </P> <P> "There are times when the national vision must come before short-term financial  considerations," said Dame Jennifer Jenkins, chairwoman of the National Trust,  which cares for most of Britain's historic sites and monuments.  </P> <P> "We are extremely disappointed. The landscape will be totally destroyed, both  visually and in terms of its tranquility."  </P> <P> Angus Stirling, director general of the trust, said: "It is extremely  disappointing that the government was not prepared to save a landscape of such  great symbolic significance by paying the extra $17.6 million, which would, in  a few years' time, have seemed a trifling sum."  </P> <P> The money would have gone to build a .75-mile-long tunnel beneath Dover's  Western Heights and to widen a road.  </P> <P> The White Cliffs dispute follows several controversies over road building in  Britain. Plans for additional four- and six-lane roads in central London have  sparked debate about spending on roads.  </P></p>

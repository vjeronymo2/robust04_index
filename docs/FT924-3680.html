			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Arts: Frank talk - Radio RELIABLE Radio 1 was sure to mark World AIDS Day, which fell on Tuesday. On that day came bulletins about AIDS and the risks in normal as well as gay sex; and on Wednesday came the first of three documentaries for young people to discuss their sexual experiences. There was little discussion, just short personal accounts of how the callers first made contact, how they discovered what they were really after, how it affected them. Rightly, no advice was given except to call the talkline (not 'helpline') if wanting expert talk. The callers were pretty frank, even the lesbians and gays (who did not seem to consider themselves exceptional). I rather wondered why any of them called the programme at all when so few seemed to have any problems; but it may have helped others to have heard them. This is just how Radio 1 should operate. You would think Pam Gems's Deborah's Daughter, Radio 4's Monday play, was a romance, and so it is, though an unusual one. Deborah Pederson visits an imaginary Arab state, where her late husband made millions from oil, with a gift of Dollars 20m. The party, that includes her mother, Lady Wiggins, and her daughter Stephanie, arrives just as the ambitious Colonel Hassan launches a successful uprising against his King. We hear little of the conflict, and Hassan's social life continues apparently undisturbed. Romance appears when he woos Deborah, in phrases like 'your soul is like a beautiful flower'. She finally falls for him, but only after a plethora of political talk on familiar oil-state lines and a fear that Hassan is after her daughter. No way - Stephanie is already pregnant by boy-friend David, who gets a job in Hassan's government; she barely earns her place in the title. It all seemed superficial, in spite of the committed playing of Prunella Scales as Deborah and Elizabeth Spriggs as her mother. Hassan is played by Raad Rawi; Adam Hussein, his ADC Ali, was also the adviser in Arabic, which Ms Scales manages fluently. Sue Dunderdale directed. Hogarth, who last week painted the pool of Bethesda in Radio 3's Sunday play, surfaced again in this week's, a revival of last year's production of Nick Dear's The Art of Success. As I wrote last time, I don't believe dirty words should be used on radio as much as they are in this play. On the stage you can take them for granted, but on radio they cause a momentary check. Their acceptability is not for me to judge; myself, I accept them willingly. But I feel they might mute the enjoyment of this enchanting play about 18th-century London's artistic low life, even if they didn't for me. Richard Wortley directed; Michael Kitchen was a fine Cockney Hogarth, Linus Roache was Fielding, Pennie Dowling was murderess Sarah Sprackling. Big Bands in the Big Apple doesn't sound like a Radio 2 programme, though it is properly faithful to Humphrey Lyttelton's The Best of Jazz. The Big Bands feature on Saturday was the first of two, an hour each, about the sidemen in the old-time big bands in New York's smart places, great for those who recall jazz players the way young people today immortalise pop-singers. I could fill the column with the names presenter Sheila Tracey brought up on her tour, with their appropriate music. It was addicts' delight. Addicts had George Shearing on Radio 2 on Monday, but 'The BBC Big Band' is not such a magical-sounding name. Thus week's castaway on Desert Island Discs was Lord Tebbit. Eminent castaways bring out the best in Sue Lawley; she never allows respect to dim her attack, and she was just as good as Tebbit - better, really, as she was the one that brought up the subjects. Like the chosen Sinatra, she did it her way.</p>

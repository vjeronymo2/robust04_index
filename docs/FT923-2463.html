			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Hopes mount for River Plate bridge ARGENTINA and Uruguay believe they have come a step closer to fulfilling a 100-year-old dream of building a bridge across the River Plate, which divides them. Officials from both countries are pleased with the results of a two-day conference last week in Buenos Aires where more than 100 bankers, construction companies, consultants and architects discussed the project. The two governments believe the 55km bridge can be built entirely with private money. The bridge would cost between Dollars 800m and Dollars 1bn (Pounds 526m). Investors would recoup their outlay through tolls and services ranging from fast food outlets to bureaux de change and duty free shops. After 30 years the concession would be transferred to the two governments. Economists estimate the bridge could yield rates of return on investment of 14-22 per cent a year. However, one engineer pointed out that a Dollars 1bn investment would require cashflows in excess of Dollars 100,000 a day - an improbable scenario. A banker said the risks of such a large, fixed investment would make some form of state guarantee essential. To be particularly attractive the project would also require a motorway link to southern Brazil. But serious discussions with Braslia over construction of a motorway have hardly begun. The bridge would present few technical difficulties; the only potential problem being the sinking of foundations into the estuary's soft, silty bed. A consultant said that although the project would not have a great environmental impact, heavy traffic flows could alter social life in Uruguay's rural interior. The two governments will spend several weeks considering suggestions made during the conference before drawing up terms of reference for a group of consultants to be hired with World Bank loans. The consultants would report back in 1994. A consortium would then be chosen to finance, build and manage the bridge, with the hope of completion by 1998.</p>

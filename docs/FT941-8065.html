			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Brussels to study Procter acquisition The European Commission is to hold a full investigation into the acquisition by Procter &amp; Gamble, the US consumer products group, of Vereinigte Papierwerke Schickedanz, a subsidiary of the German partnership Gustav und Grete Schickedanz, it was announced in Brussels yesterday. The commission will consider whether the acquisition by Procter &amp; Gamble GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Procter &amp; Gamble, breaches the Commission's competition rules in the European market for female sanitary protection. The Commission inquiry follows a preliminary investigation into the implications of the acquisition for the European markets in diapers and feminine protection. Procter &amp; Gamble has promised to divest VPS's baby diaper business and part of its feminine protection business to comply witb EU competition rules. But the Commission remained concerned the moves still left Procter &amp; Gamble in breach of EU competition rules in the sanitary-towel sector of the feminine protection market, not least because Procter &amp; Gamble would acquire VPS's leading sanitary-towel brand in Germany, the commission said. 'Whether the geographic market concerned is national or EEA-wide, the combined market shares of Procter &amp; Gamble and VPS raise serious doubts as to the operation's compatibility with the Common Market,' the Commission said. It pointed out that factors such as consumer brand loyalty, high promotion costs and the strength of Procter &amp; Gamble in branded consumer products meant there were already significant barriers to market entry. The key task for the commission now would be to define the feminine protection market, especially if it was national or European in nature, Mr Bruno Julien, commission spokesman said. Under EU rules the investigation will take up to four months.</p>

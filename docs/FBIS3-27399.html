Taiwan exports to Spain totaled U.S.$553 million in 1993,  down 32.1 percent from the previous year, while imports from  Spain registered U.S.$291 million, up 52.9 percent, Spanish  customs tallies revealed.    The increase in Spanish imports and drop in Taiwan exports  help cut Spain's trade deficit with Taiwan. Spain's trade  deficit was U.S.$262 million in 1993, down 138 percent from  U.S.$624 million in 1992.</p>

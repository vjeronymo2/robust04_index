			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS  </P> <P> Court Decision: Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall apparently is getting  along well with his new colleague, David H. Souter, despite Marshall's biting  comment about Souter's appointment. Justice Antonin Scalia, speaking to  students at George Washington law school in Washington, D.C., Tuesday, said:  "They're getting along . . . . They're both very likeable people."  </P> <P> Marshall said in July he had never heard of Souter and said of Bush: "I think  somebody's calling his shots."  </P> <P> Fergie's Friends: The duchess of York says she once ran with a fast crowd that  included drug abusers. The former Sarah Ferguson toured a drug rehabilitation  clinic in New York Monday and told the patients that "a lot of my friends have  been alcoholics and drug addicts. It's important that we stand together." The  duchess is wife of Britain's Prince Andrew.  </P> <P> Mind Games: Magician Doug Henning says he and Indian guru Maharishi Mahesh Yogi  will build a $1 billion theme park, practically in Walt Disney World's back  yard, featuring magic and Eastern-style meditation. "Vedaland" will open in  1993 in Orlando, Fla., with attractions on the themes of knowledge,  enlightenment and entertainment and will include a building apparently  suspended above water. Veda is an Eastern term meaning knowledge, Henning said.  </P> <P> No Fig Newtons: For the third year in a row, Rep. Wayne Owens (D-Utah) has held  a "Mrs. Fields Cookie Day" for his colleagues in the House. Debbi and Randy  Fields, creators of the popular cookie franchise, are from back home in Park  City, Utah. Owens had planned to give the chocolate chip treats to all the  members except House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, but at the last minute,  decided that in the hope of getting Congress adjourned, even Gingrich would get  his cookies.  </P></p>

L. 102&hyph;550, approved October 28, 1992) (hereafter section 132). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency and permits the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha in the State of Nebraska (hereafter ``the Housing Authority''). The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the effectiveness of promoting homeownership and providing support services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Expiration date. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This part 907 expires on January 24, 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;907.2&blank;Applicability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This part applies to single-family public housing units administered by the Housing Authority that have been designated by the Housing Authority for eventual homeownership. Before entering into a contract or other obligation to sell a home to a homebuyer under this part, the Housing Authority will give the Department of Housing and Urban Development (hereafter HUD) a written proposed designation that a home is to be sold under this part. The proposed designation shall specify the address of the unit(s) to be sold. HUD shall review the proposed designation to ensure that the designated home is single family public housing, that the Housing Authority has not designated more than twenty percent of the total number of public housing units that it administers and that the location of the homes complies with fair housing requirements. (The twenty percent ceiling on the number of homes that can be designated is 602 homes plus twenty percent of any additional public housing units developed by the Housing Authority through the award of public housing development funds pursuant to section 5 of the 1937 Act subsequent to October 28, 1992 that do not constitute replacement units for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to Section 18 of the 1937 Act or the Section 5(H) or Title III homeownership programs under the 1937 Act.) Consistent with the Housing Authority's affirmative obligation to further fair housing objectives, the Housing Authority shall offer homeownership opportunities in a variety of locations and promote an expanded housing choice for minorities. Homeownership opportunities for minorities shall include locations not located in an area of minority concentration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;907.3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> General authority for sale.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Housing Authority may sell single family homes designated pursuant to &sect;907.2, for purposes of homeownership, according to a homeownership plan approved by HUD under this part. If the home is subject to indebtedness under the ACC, HUD will continue to make any debt service contributions for which it is obligated under the ACC, and the property sold will not be subject to the encumbrance of that indebtedness. (In the case of a home that is part of a development with financing restrictions (such as a bond-financed development), however, sale is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable restrictions.) In reference to housing properties, ``development'' means the same as ``project,'' as defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937 (hereafter the 1937 Act), rather than the statutory definition of ``development.'' Upon sale in accordance with the HUD-approved homeownership plan, HUD will execute a release of the title restrictions prescribed by the ACC. Because the property will no longer be subject to the ACC after sale, it will cease to be eligible for further HUD funding for operating subsidies or modernization under the 1937 Act upon conveyance of title by the PHA. (That does not preclude any other types of post-sale subsidies that may be available, under other Federal, State, or local programs, such as the possibility of available assistance under Section 8 of the 1937 Act, in connection with a plan for cooperative homeownership.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;907.4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Fundamental criteria for HUD approval.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD will approve the Housing Authority's homeownership plan if it meets all three of the following criteria:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) The plan must be practically workable, with sound potential for long-term success. Financial viability, including the capability of purchasers to meet the financial obligations of homeownership, is a critical requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The plan must be consistent with law, including the requirements of this part, any other applicable Federal, State, and local statutes and regulations, and existing contracts. Subject to the other two criteria stated in this section, any provision that is not contrary to those legal requirements may be included in the plan, at the discretion of the Housing Authority, whether or not expressly authorized in this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

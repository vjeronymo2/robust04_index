			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Management (GEC At The Crossroads): Defence of the realm - Part Two, Charles Leadbeater reports on the group's strategy for Marconi Sir Robert Easton was exhausted. He was at the end of five days and nights negotiating with a group of Malaysian admirals to win an order for two frigates. Each day the negotiations ended later than the day before, only to resume promptly at 8.30am. For Sir Robert this was a make-or-break deal. It had taken four years of patient persuasion to get this far. The fate of his Yarrow shipyard on Glasgow's Clydeside hung on the outcome of the talks in a luxury hotel in Kuala Lumpur. A dearth of defence orders had forced the yard, bought by GEC in 1986, into hibernation. The long halls from which boats had been launched since the 19th century were filled only by the echoes of welders fabricating steel for Drax power stations. The business was hanging on by its finger tips. And the drawing office - central to the yard's ability to design as well as build ships - was in an even worse position. The Malaysian order was the only chance of work for the highly-skilled draughtsmen. Sir Robert knew that, in spite of a recent Pounds 400m British government order to build three frigates, the design office did not have enough work to keep it going. He was also aware that if the drawing office shrank there was a risk it could set off an irreversible decline at the yard. The Malaysian admirals gave Yarrow the Pounds 400m order last March. But Mr Murray Easton, the yard's chief executive and Sir Robert's son, recalls how close it had been: 'If we had lost that order the future of the yard would have been in severe jeopardy. There was little prospect of diversification or exports keeping it going. We would have faced some very painful choices.' Even so, the orders only offer Yarrow security until the mid-1990s. The desperate hunt for orders will soon have to start again. With three other warship builders in the UK, the competition will be intense. Indeed Yarrow's fight for survival is just one example of how perilous the defence business has become since the end of the Cold war. Spending on defence is falling. There are fewer large programmes, and those left are becoming more uncertain. Contractors are having to put large sums into development work, even though orders are being cut and delayed. Customers are expecting more sophisticated products and, taking advantage of cut-throat competition, demanding cheaper prices. Thus the contractors' profit margins are being squeezed. Companies are so desperate to keep their factories working, that they are prepared to lodge loss-making bids for business. Once a company has won an order - whether for a frigate, a fighter or a radar system - it will have to spend more of its own money to develop the product than it used to, it will have to wait longer to get paid and an increasing share of the payments will be withheld until the product proves itself in the field. This is an upheaval for defence contracting, which until six years ago worked like a comfortable club. A former senior official at the Ministry of Defence describes how cosy life used to be for the contractors: 'Large defence suppliers thought the purpose of the MoD was to keep them fully occupied. The assumption was that if they were working on a large contract they would get paid Pounds 20m a month no matter what they did.' Those days are no more, and their passing strikes at the heart of Marconi, GEC's defence arm. Marconi is now under siege. As Mr David Fletcher, Marconi's managing director, puts it: 'It is becoming an all-or-nothing business in some areas where there are fewer and fewer big contracts. If you lose one deal then you may have to exit the field altogether.' Marconi is the largest single chunk of GEC's business, with an annual turnover close to Pounds 3bn, and its future is central to that of the group. Most of the other big parts of GEC's business are run jointly with partners - Alsthom in power engineering, Siemens in telecommunications and General Electric of the US in domestic appliances - but in defence GEC's future is entirely in its own hands. In the last few years it has taken a Pounds 1bn gamble to go deeper into the market in spite of the end of the Cold war. Marconi's turnover rose from Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn through the acquisition of large parts of the defence businesses of Plessey and Ferranti. But as yet the results of these takeovers are not flattering. GEC executives admit the Plessey purchase has yet to pay its way. Three years on, the deal is still diluting GEC's earnings. And the Ferranti radar business in Edinburgh, which GEC bought for Pounds 300m two years ago, could also face problems. It was purchased mainly because it is developing the radar for the European Fighter Aircraft. Now the EFA programme is in doubt and if it collapses, senior GEC executives say there would be serious consequences for Ferranti. These problems in mind, it will be difficult enough to consolidate Marconi's position in the defence market, but in addition the company is being asked to provide much of GEC's future growth by attempting what it has never yet achieved: success in consumer electronics markets, competing with the big Japanese groups. If Marconi thrives, it will drive GEC forward. If it fails, GEC's wholly-owned activities could be reduced to a motley rag bag of defence and industrial companies. Senior GEC executives are in no doubt how much is at stake. One non-executive director says: 'We have to exploit Marconi's technology to move into consumer, industrial and medical electronics markets. Unless steps are taken in each of these areas it is difficult to see how the group will achieve growth.' Senior GEC managers are acutely aware that so far Marconi has failed to exploit fully the potential of its technology. Lord Prior, GEC's chairman, admits: 'We have not got that right yet.' The plain speaking Mr Fletcher, who became Marconi's managing director last year, is well aware of the difficulties facing the group. 'If we behave in an old fashioned, insular way, relying on our old defence markets our fate will be gentle decline,' he says. He is attacking Marconi's weaknesses with gusto, forcing through a more aggressive approach to defence markets. By the end of the decade he wants 50 per cent of its sales to come from non-defence areas. In defence itself, Marconi starts from a strong position. It is the dominant defence electronics group in the UK. Its acquisitions in the 1980s have eliminated competitors so, in electronics, it does not face cut-throat competition of the type that Yarrow still faces in warships. Its acquisitions also have an international significance. Through its purchase of Plessey, GEC now has some important US defence interests. Among them is a potential electronic gold mine tucked away in the suburbs of New Jersey, GEC Marconi Electronic Systems. This is likely to supply most of the US Air Force with the system known as JTIDS (Joint Tactical Information Distribution System) that should replace radar as the means by which fighter aircraft identify targets. GEC's dominance in British defence electronics has also strengthened its bargaining position within the European defence industry. An example is the way its relationship with Thomson-CSF, the French defence electronics group, has expanded since the Ferranti and Plessey purchases. But perhaps most importantly, Marconi can draw upon great technological resources. GEC is often accused of undervaluing technology. Marconi, however, is crammed with talented engineers. At its research centres at Caswell near Milton Keynes and Great Baddow near Chelmsford it has a stockpile of technology which is the envy of competitors. It has laser-guided weapons and gyroscopes in Edinburgh and torpedoes and satellites in Portsmouth. When all Marconi's strengths converge the result is a world-class company. One example is the avionics division in an old Short Brothers' hangar at an airfield just outside Rochester, Kent. From this unprepossessing base the avionics group has become the world's largest supplier of head-up displays for fighter aircraft, one of the leading suppliers to the US armed forces outside North America and a leading sub-contractor to Boeing. At Rochester high technology, sound finance and commercial ambition combine. But even at its best Marconi has some nagging weaknesses, which are inextricably linked to the way GEC works. It g with GEC's traditions. Marconi is usually a sub-contractor, supplying components, often very large pieces of equipment, to other companies. It now needs to become a prime contractor - integrating important projects. Prime contracting is how defence companies earn their healthiest profits. Mr Fletcher explains: 'If you are just a supplier of bits and pieces you will get lost. You only keep charge of technological developments if you are a prime contractor. If not you end up being a lackey working within someone else's system.' To prevent Marconi becoming a high technology 'lackey' Mr Fletcher needs to pull together his company's far-flung resources. Marconi is a loose federation of about 40 companies, collected by a string of acquisitions. This federation, however, has a history of sectarianism. It has frequently been prone to border disputes which constantly threatened civil war. There is deep rivalry and sometimes outright hostility between Marconi companies. As a senior GEC executive puts it: 'Marconi companies only used to talk in order to tell one another lies.' Some customers say they used to see a string of Marconi companies. Each would seek to undermine the others and all would distance themselves from GEC. The Eastons of Yarrow saw no merit in highlighting their links with Marconi when the yard was bought by GEC. Mr Murray Easton says: 'In the late 1980s this company did not make a strong play of its links with GEC. There was no great attempt to find synergies.' The tension between Marconi companies was partly created by a policy of divide and rule from on high. GEC encouraged them to compete against one another. The antagonisms ran deep. Staff at the Caswell research centre recently brought together the four Marconi companies which use its gallium arsenide semi-conductors, to discuss joint product development. One executive present recalls: 'The polite description is that there was tough negotiating. The reality is there was almost a punch up.' The warring Marconi baronies only really came under the sway of GEC's Stanhope Gate headquarters in the mid-1980s. Lord Weinstock was far from ruthless with Marconi. 'We took it very slowly because the companies fought with one another,' he says. 'It was very difficult to knock heads together. If we had alienated people we might have lost them without having replacements. We were very gentle with it.' GEC eventually paid for this gentleness with the Nimrod fiasco. One of the biggest cost overruns in British defence history, this became a byword for all that was bad with the cosy world of cost-plus defence contracting. The Nimrod early-warning radar was scrapped in December 1986 after almost Pounds 1bn had been spent on its nine-year development. The project was several years behind schedule and hugely over cost. Many of the problems were of the MoD's own making. It kept changing its mind about what kind of system was needed. But Nimrod also exposed Marconi's weaknesses. A former MoD official closely involved in Nimrod, says: 'One of the problems was that people were not telling Weinstock the truth about the project and he had no way of really checking what was going on in Marconi.' Nimrod was the turning point. The MoD introduced competitive tendering and a long overdue change came to Marconi in the shape of Mr Fletcher, who says: 'Life was easier in the past. That kind of competition between our own companies is a luxury we can no longer afford.' Now Marconi has a younger, more aggressive management with plans to shake up the business by pulling together its resources through greater central direction. The old guard has been overthrown at its headquarters at Stanmore in Middlesex. About three quarters of the managing directors of Marconi companies have been replaced in the last 18 months. Teams are being formed from companies across the group to focus their diverse skills on the same market. The marketing chiefs of all Marconi companies recently gathered at Stanmore to discuss their plans. It was the first time they had met. Lord Weinstock remarks: 'I have seen two generations of management at Marconi. These are the ones we have most given their heads, the least conservative, the most adventurous and the most aggressive.' But for all his drive and confidence Mr Fletcher still has a huge task on his hands apart from the bewildering maze of subsidiaries. The group's initial outings as a prime contractor have not got off to an encouraging start. Its bids for the Merlin helicopter, the Asraam missile and the initial phase of the command system for the future Anglo-French frigate all failed. Mr Fletcher is pulling his subsidiaries together. But they still all report their financial results directly to Lord Weinstock, and to break Marconi's centrifugal culture the group will have to claim more independence from Stanhope Gate - a move which is bound to provoke tension. One senior Marconi executive says: 'We want more freedom and in time we will get it. If Lord Weinstock fell under a bus tomorrow we could carry on as normal. We are the ones running the company.' On top of this the really difficult task will be doubling Marconi's sales in non-defence markets. There are no easy pickings in consumer electronics. Thomson of France, which has spent large sums to build an international television manufacturing business, is making big losses on its consumer activities. And Philips, the leading European consumer electronics group, is up to its knees in red ink in spite of two years of restructuring. This is the lions' den Marconi is about to throw itself into. There have been some successes already. Marconi's expertise in signal processing for military communications has led it into making receivers for satellite television. There are also some exciting products on the way - a video phone which is attracting interest from large US telephone companies and an interactive video system which United Airlines has chosen in preference to a Japanese design for its in-flight entertainment system. Marconi's expertise could spawn a wide range of products in telecommunications, air traffic control, transport and environmental monitoring. Marconi executives are excited at taking their first faltering steps into the bright world of consumer market. But they face big obstacles. What Marconi needs are alternative families of products to replace the defence work. Yet even when companies have excellent technology, it is extremely difficult to turn an idea into a product which could support a business. At Ferranti Defence Systems in Edinburgh, a trawl brought to the surface 530 ideas without any plans to turn them into a product. Thirty ideas had a business plan but lacked people or cash to turn them into a product. Just 20 activities might provide the basis for real businesses. Mr Roy Tait head of Ferranti's civil businesses says: 'It would cost Pounds 1m just to winnow the ideas down into realistic proposals.' Armed with new products, the next hurdle is to achieve commercial viability. Marconi's defence factories will need overhauling to compete in consumer areas. The Broadacre missile plant in Portsmouth has started and the shock of making simple electronic components for satellite television receivers, at a cost of less than Pounds 2 each, has forced the management to revolutionise manufacturing methods. It has slashed stocks, reduced the number of suppliers, and improved the design of products in a drive for efficiency. The plant now makes electronics components as efficiently as commercial competitors. It is also making missiles much more efficiently. In 1990 it took 1,700 hours to produce the key part of an Alarm missile. With just-in-time manufacturing that has come down to 700 hours. But the final obstacle Marconi faces is the biggest - its lack of marketing expertise. At their most introverted, Marconi executives believe they are the industrial arm of the MoD. In the words of a Stanhope Gate executive: 'They are trying to market their video phone as if it were a frigate.' Mr Fletcher plans to offset this marketing weakness by forging alliances with well established consumer electronics groups. But Marconi will require more than that. It is just dawning on executives that they will probably have to make significant acquisitions. Marconi's consumer efforts seem chaotic. A plethora of companies are working on overlapping products. Some GEC executives believe Marconi needs radical surgery. 'There are two world class operations struggling to get out of a rambling, sprawling business,' says one director. 'Marconi is making a lot of money, but it would be making a whole lot more if it were split into a defence electronics company and a consumer electronics company, with separate boards, separate balance sheets, separate factories. It is a mess now.' It will take Marconi at least five years if not 10 to develop any businesses to match the scale of its military activities. Thus GEC is already searching for alternative routes to bolster its civil businesses. Top executives say the company needs to find another non-defence leg to stand on, a division with a turnover of at least Pounds 500m a year. Several companies outside Marconi might provide the source of new growth, but GEC's record in this area is mixed. In 1981 it bought AB Dick, the US photo copier group, as a launch pad into the office equipment market. It now admits that strategy has failed and AB Dick is a prime prospect for disposal. One candidate for growth could be Picker, the US-based medical electronics business with a Pounds 500m-a-year turnover. It makes a variety of high technology scanners and is holding its own with much bigger competitors, such as Siemens of Germany. It can probably afford the investment to stay abreast of the industry leaders, but is unlikely to be able to grow rapidly. Nor is Picker likely to form the core of a larger medical division. The abortive talks which GEC held with Philips in the mid-1980s to merge their medical businesses are unlikely to be rekindled, and Mr Carey Nolan, Picker's managing director, does not want to expand into the health care businesses outside scanners. GEC's other civil activities are too scattered and too small to form the basis for a major business. It has some tidy niche businesses, such as Gilbarco, one of the world's leading manufacturers of petrol pumps based in North Carolina; Videojet, the US specialist printer; Avery, the weighing-machine maker based in Birmingham; and GPLS, the specialist semi-conductor maker in Plymouth. All these - especially Gilbarco and Videojet - are good, well-run businesses. But they are not the stuff from which industrial empires are made. These limitations are recognised by GEC, which is cooking up an alternative plan. It goes something like this: The company could sell the least attractive of the collection of small businesses which it owns - AB Dick and GEC's cable operations would lead the way. Combined with the company's close to Pounds 1bn of cash reserves, the disposals could finance a major acquisition to form a new leg for the business. The problem is to decide what to buy. In the 1980s GEC spent most of its famous cash mountain by expanding into defence. What will it do in the 1990s? A move outside its traditional areas of manufacturing is out of the question. A senior GEC executive explains: 'We do not want to buy something in a business we know very little about. That is how we have got into trouble in the past. It would be better to give the money back to the shareholders than to do that.' An alternative is to expand away from manufacturing into related service areas. For instance Lord Weinstock would like to bring together all the after sales service operations within GEC to create a large business which would service anything from petrol pumps and weighing machines, to computers and washing machines. GEC has also considered a move into telecommunications services, possibly by running a mobile communications network. To GEC's critics, a turn away from manufacturing into services would be the final proof that the company does not have the ambition to build a great industrial combine on the industrial assets it inherited. To the group's senior executives, a move into services which are related to its manufacturing interests, managing electricity grids as well as making switchgear, managing telecommunications networks as well as making switches, could provide the best counterweight to the defence decline. It would be proof of the group's maturity and balance.</p>

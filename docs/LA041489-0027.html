			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA REVISES LAW PROTECTING OAKS  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council has approved an ordinance, more than a year in  the making, to preserve oak trees, long regarded as the symbol of the Santa  Clarita Valley.  </P> <P> The measure refines an emergency oak ordinance passed the day the city  incorporated Dec. 15, 1987. The new ordinance, approved Tuesday night, spells  out how and when residents may trim or remove the trees.  </P> <P> City officials said the new ordinance is more flexible than the emergency  measure, which required residents to obtain $125 permits to trim or remove  trees. Under the new ordinance, a permit will not be needed for routine  maintenance or to remove deadwood under six inches in circumference.  </P> <P> Under the new ordinance, trimming permits will cost $25. Permits to remove oaks  will remain $125. Oak trees may only be removed with city approval.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The 64M DRAM, which mainly employs a stack cell  technology, is not unlike the 16M generation of chips in terms  of cell technology, but it does offer three different types of  cell structures to choose from depending on storage capacity  work. Three companies have adopted the suddenly popular  thick-stack structure with thick memory nodes. It is the  simplest structure, but there is a wide disparity with  peripheral circuits. Changing the array configuration, however,  has made it easier to link with peripheral circuits. Three  companies have adopted a fin-type cell structure, and four  others a round cell structure. Meanwhile, three companies in  selecting a trench cell structure have switched to the substrate  cell plate format. As for wiring, the number of companies using  tungsten in the first wiring layer has increased to four. The  through holes are formed at the same time as the second wiring  layer, so many companies have designed the holes as large as  0.8. The main lithography used was the i-line method.  Companies also mentioned super-resolution and KrF excimer  lithography, but by and large these companies combined those  methods with i-line excimers in order to keep down cost.    The 64M DRAM chips that have just started being shipped  employ, for the most part, the same stack cell technology that  earlier 16M devices used (cf. Figure 1 [figure not reproduced],  and Figure 2). Among the 14 major DRAM  manufacturers,[.sup](1)[/] 11 have selected the stack method.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 2. Structure of Thick Stack. This drawing is a  longitudinal structural view of the thick stack structure  adopted by NEC. The adoption of a secondary/primary word line  configuration and 2.4 line spacing in the aluminum  wiring enabled the circuits to be printed even with a  disparity.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Two of the companies surveyed reported switching wiring  configurations from the two-layer aluminum wiring used in the  16M chips to a single aluminum layer and single tungsten layer,  and one other company is reported to be studying the idea of  switching to that in second generation chips, including the one  company which is the fourth adopting this wiring scheme. In  terms of lithography, which has a lot to do with equipment cost,  most companies opted to continue using i-line lithography, but  there were a few companies who chose to use KrF excimer lasers  or super-resolution lithography to print fine or deep contact  holes.  <H5>  Stack Cell Structure Offers Variety of Structures </H5>   Most manufacturers have not changed the cell structure of  their chips, whether the stack or trench format, since the 16M  generation of chips. Manufacturers have given users the choice,  however, of three different cell structures depending on the way  in which the surface area is worked (cf. Figure 3). The first  cell structure is a "thick stack" in which the surface area is  built up with poly-Si storage nodes. The second structure is the  fin stack in which the opposite side of the storage nodes are  also used, and the third cell structure is the round stack in  which the storage nodes are round-shaped. Initially, most of the  companies surveyed indicated that they wanted to use new  materials such as ferroelectric film or films with a high  dielectric constant in the chips, but one of the process  specialists working in one of the joint developments said that  because the material technologies were behind schedule that the  companies opted to use different cell structures instead.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 3. Changes in Memory Cell Structure. The diagram  shows the changes that have taken place in memory cell  structures since the 256K generation of chips. A lot of  manufacturers have been using the stack method, but there are  still many different options available regarding cell structure. [.sup]*1  [/]  indicates that the company has combined that with  a rough structure in which the capacitor is made with an uneven  surface. [.sup]*2[/] indicates estimates made by Nikkei  Microdevices.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Wanting to form bit lines in flat areas, nine out of 11  companies opted to use a combined shielded bit-line structure in  which the bit-lines are made to run under the cell (cf. Table  1). The fact that this structure enables better noise resistance  kept most companies away from the twisted bit structure which  offsets in-phase noise within the array.       Table 2.

All companies surveyed want to develop a chip with an image-oriented memory and a dedicated logic  circuit, but very few of the companies have any detailed plans as such.   [.sup]*[/]: Estimate made by Nikkei Microdevices; 1G: First-generation product; 2G: Second-generation product      The three companies that had been using the trench cell  switched to a substrate cell plate.  <H5>  Avoiding Process Complexity </H5>   The three companies that have adopted the thick stack are  NEC, Oki Electric, and Matsushita Electric. Mitsubishi is also  studying whether to switch to a thick stack in the first  generation chips. Oki Electric has integrated this with a rough  structure in which the capacitor is given an uneven surface. One  company, Fujitsu, adopted the fin stack. It also appears as if  Hitachi and Texas Instruments (US) have selected this structure  as well. The four companies that have adopted the round stack  include Mitsubishi, Samsung Electronics (S. Korea), Gold Star  Electronics, and Micron Semiconductor. Micron Semiconductor also  combined this with a rough uneven structure.    The biggest advantage of the thick stack, says a NEC  official, is that it expands the surface area without making the  process any more complex. The official went on to say that the  64M chip was made by almost the same process as the 16M chip.    In order to make the most of this, NEC has been trying to  resolve the disparity problem, which is one of the biggest  problems it faces. It has, for example, built the poly-Si up to  0.8 in order to ensure a 25fF storage capacity and  7C[.sub]B[/]/C[.sub]S[/]. This  widened the disparity between the array and peripheral circuits,  and widened the disparity even further between adjoining cells.    As a way of resolving this, NEC changed to an array  structure[.sup](2)[/] and widened the line spacing in the  aluminum layer forming the main word-lines to 2.4. This  essentially gave it a better focal depth and resolved the  disparity problem. The size of the chip is somewhat larger, but  NEC confidently said that this was not a problem because it used  the same processes as the 16M chips.    The companies that opted for the fin and round stacks did so  because they could use the same array configurations as before,  and also because they could even use the same structure in  smaller second generation chips. Mitsubishi, which used the  round stack, and Fujitsu, which used a fin stack, reported that  the processes presented equal levels of difficulty. Both the  round stack used by Mitsubishi that was built up to a height of  0.5-0.6, and the two-layer fin stack used by Fujitsu that  was  built to a height 0.4 were lower than the thick stack. Both  companies admit that the 64M chips are larger than the 16M  chips, but say that they have been able to avoid using any  special complex processes.  <H5>  Still Room for Further Changes </H5>   However, the choice of cell structures is still in flux.  Many  chip manufacturers are thinking about making structural changes  in both the reliability batch of sample chips and in the second  generation chips.    NEC, which relieved cell pitch and changed the word-line  configuration by adopting the thick stack, says in the  second-generation of chips that it wants to use HSG  (hemi-spherical grain) technology, if possible, in which  unevenly formed poly-Si on the surface of the storage nodes is  used to increase the effective capacity of the chip by 1.5  times. HSG is used in conjunction with thick stacks having a  height of about 0.5. This does not change the array  configurations in the first generation of chips. Mitsubishi is  also studying the idea of switching to the HSG method midway  through the first generation of chips as a way to effectively  reduce cost if it can be done with the thick stack cell  structure. Fujitsu, which adopted the fin stack for the 64M  chips, is in the process of studying ways to eliminate one of  the fins in order to ensure the required storage capacity.    As far as film thickness, all companies surveyed are using  an  SiO[.sub]2[/] conversion film applied to a thickness of 5 nm.  Oki Electric confirmed that a 5 nm film thickness presents no  problems even with rough surfaces having uneven storage nodes  (cf. Figure 4).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 4. Excellent Leakage Characteristic in Rough Stack  Having Uneven Poly-Si Surface. A rough stack structure is 2.5  times more effective than an ordinary stack in terms of current  leakage. The only area where leakage has been shown to increase  is where the surface has been enlarged, but even so, the rough  stack structure still meets the  10[.sup]-8[/]A/cm[.sup]2[/] specifications for 64M chips  with 5 nm oxide film when 1.5V, or 1/2  V[.sub]cc[/], is applied to the chip. Data  furnished by Oki Electric.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Both Toshiba and IBM-Siemens, which opted for the trench  format, switched to a substrate cell plate trench. All three of  these companies have been working jointly to develop a 256M  chip, but the reason why both made the switch at the same time  had more to do with the problems that arise when dealing with a  trench structure, and not because they had exchanged  technologies.    In conventional trenches, the trenches need a large area of  separation between them to contain leakage. In the trench  structure which these companies adopted, the charge is stored  within the trench, so that area was reduced. Moreover, since the  cell plates are adjoined to the substrate, it is no longer  necessary to have plates at the surface be in contact with the  capacitors, thus flatness is improved.    The problem with this modification, however, is the fact  that  the storage nodes within the trenches become gates, and a  parasitic MOS is formed between the diffusion layer of the  trench and the cell plate. In order to minimize the parasitic  MOS effect, Toshiba formed oxide film within the trench to a  depth 50-100 nm. Another problem with a trench cell is that the  electrodes protrude from inside the trenches. Both Toshiba and  IBM-Siemens handled this by erecting pillar-shaped electrodes  from the inside. This is because it is much too difficult to  ensure reproduction using a method of contact from the wall  surface of the trench. Toshiba says that this structure produces  less soft error than the stack cell (cf. Figure 5).  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 5. Substrate Cell Plate Helps Reduce Soft Errors.  Soft errors were measured using 4M memory cells. Soft errors  depend on the structure of the cell, so this comparison is  effective only as far as the 64M. Data furnished by Toshiba. The  added acceleration is due to americium. It includes both the bit  line mode and cell mode. Toshiba said that the cell mode is  small, so it will try to improve the bit line mode in the  future.&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  Adopting Tungsten Wiring To Lower Cost </H5>   As for embedding the contact holes, Fujitsu and Oki Electric  adopted the idea of using tungsten for the first wiring, a  process Hitachi had also used in 16M devices, and in doing so,  have eliminated the need for the embedding process itself.  Hitachi also seems to be leaning toward this method in its 64M  chips. The result in each of these cases has been a reduction in  the number of processes. NEC is also studying the idea of using  this technique in its second generation 64M devices. Other  companies are continuing to use the integrated blanket-W  etchback process used in 16M generation chips.    The manufacturers who have opted to use tungsten for the  first wiring layer say performance degradation, i.e. slow access  time, is prevented by the increased wiring delay with materials  having high resistance.    Fujitsu, for example, which adopted tungsten with word-line  backing, prevented degradation by modifying the array  configuration (cf. Figure 6). In order to inhibit word-line  delays, it doubled the number of word-line divisions. By adding  two word-line decoders in central locations along the length of  the chip, it cut the length of word-line backing in half.  Fujitsu went on to say that the enlarged chip area, due to the  increase in word-line divisions, was not a significant problem  at all.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 6. Access Time Not Slowed With Tungsten. Access  time is hardly a problem when tungsten is used for the first  wiring layer. Using tungsten causes a 3-4 ns delay relative to a  40 ns operating time. The (a) calculations were done by Fujitsu  and the (b) calculations by Oki Electric.&lt;/graphic&gt;     Toshiba, which opted to embed poly-Si, reported serious  contact resistance problems. Toshiba did not embed poly-Si  directly, but rather put down a barrier metal of TiN to minimize  contact resistance.    As for through holes, there were some companies who felt  inclined to use an embedding method in the 64M chips, but by and  large most companies surveyed decided to stay with aluminum  wiring. Toshiba, Samsung, and IBM-Siemens were the exceptions.  Toshiba opted for the select W method of embedding through  holes, and Samsung went with the aluminum reflow sputter method,  which it has used since the 4M generation of chips. IBM-Siemens  have started using the CMP (chemical milling and polishing)  method in their jointly developed 64M chips. Other than  IBM-Siemens, all other companies have reverted to 16M  technology. Toshiba, though, is looking into the idea of  changing to a method in which the through holes are joined to  the aluminum wiring directly.    This is because it simplifies the process. Fujitsu and  Mitsubishi have each said that they have widened the diameter of  the holes to 0.8 in order to adopt this process.    Flattening is also a problem as shown in Figure 8 [figure  not  reproduced]. IBM-Siemens and Micron Semiconductor have both  opted for the CMP method. NEC says it is studying the idea for  second generation chips.       Table 2.

These were divided, however, into those who also used  super-resolution methods such as phase-shifting or modified  illumination, and those who used KrF excimer lasers.    Toshiba favored phase-shifting, but did not use that method  in the 64M samples. Toshiba stated that it would like to use the  half-tone method if possible to do the contact areas when the  chips go into mass-production. To do this, it will have to  correct the masks. Oki Electric used the modified illumination  method to do the contacts. Samsung said it would like to use the  ATOM method which it developed on its own.    There is growing recognition that short wavelengths are the  best means to produce the fine line widths required in  present-day lithography. Samsung says that there is a  possibility that the use of KrF excimers will continue to  expand. The use of KrF excimers is limited on account of cost to  critical layers such as gates and contacts, and the remaining  layers are done by i-line excimers.    Micron Semiconductor has adopted KrF excimer lithography in  its first generation chips, and Mitsubishi and Fujitsu are  likely to use it starting in the second generation. There  appears to be some progress made in using chemically amplified  resists for both stabilization and formation as illustrated in  Figure 9 [figure not reproduced]. This technology is too much of  a financial risk in terms of initial start-up and operating  costs. At the present time, it appears to be twice as expensive  as i-line lithography (cf. Figure 10). Mitsubishi tends to favor  the use of KrF excimers for the five-layer second-generation  chips.  &lt;graphic&gt;  &lt;capt&gt; Figure 10. Analysis of Lithography Costs. The analysis (a)  is that of large foreign and domestic LSI manufacturers and  analysis (b) is that of Mitsubishi Electric. Mitsubishi expects  the cost to print wafers using an excimer laser to be 1.2 times  more expensive than by i-line lithography.&lt;/graphic&gt;   <H5>  Addendum A </H5> <H5>  Domestic and Foreign Companies Begin Restudying Al Reflow </H5> Sputter Technology    Top domestic and foreign manufacturers have begun restudying  the use of aluminum reflow technology. In addition to  re-examining the use of tungsten to lower cost, a lot of  interest has been stirred up over the use of aluminum reflow  technology since Samsung Electronics of S. Korea introduced it  in the 4M generation of products. In September at the 54th  meeting of the Japanese Society of Applied Physics, the USLI  Device R&amp;D Lab of NEC and the Basic Process Development  Division  of Fujitsu announced the use of this technology.    Hoping to lower resistance of the 0.6 through-holes,  NEC  compared two films for a barrier metal, namely, one consisting  of a 30 nm Ti layer and the other consisting of a 100 nm TiN  layer and a 10 nm Ti layer, and for the wiring material,  compared AlSiCu with AlCu. Since the resistance with the TiN/Ti  layer was more than 10 times that of the 0.1_O_/[square] Ti  layer, the Ti proved to be more effective. The reason was  because it turned to an alloy when heated to 450-500C  during reflow. The difference due to the change in wiring  material was insignificant.    Fujitsu tried to lower the process temperature in order to  improve the embedding characteristics of 0.4 holes, and to  improve the characteristics of TiN that make it defective at  high temperatures. When the pressure was set at 10[.sup]11[/]  Torr (1 Torr = 133 Pa), it produced embedded through-holes  having 0.4 hole diameter and 2.75 aspect ratio. This was  because lowering the pressure during the sputter to  10[.sup]-8[/] Torr kept the angle of incidence of the  aluminum particles to within 5. The reflow temperature was  further lowered to 250C. This was due to a partial pressure  of 2 x 10[.sup]11[/] Torr being achieved in the residual  oxidized gases such as O[.sub]2[/] and H[.sub]2[/]O which  impede fluidity.  <H5>  Addendum B </H5> <H5>  Keeping Distortion Discrepancy to Less Than </H5> 0.06 by Joint Use of i-Line and KrF Excimer    There are still a lot of problems that remain to be solved  in  terms of increased production cost when it comes to using i-line  and KrF lithography together. These include improving the  etching resistance characteristic to narrow the difference  between i-line distortion and KrF distortion.    Fujitsu, which wants to use both lithographies in its second  generation of 64M chips, calculated the degree of allowable  difference between the two. It reported that the difference  between the two must be kept to 0.06 or less (Matsuno, et  al.: Proceedings of 54th Conference of Japanese Society of  Applied Physics, Monograph No. 27a-SHF-22, Sep 1993).    This study was based on the assumption that KrF lithography  was used only to print contact holes, and that the resists used  were chemically amplified positive type resists. The study  compared i-line lithography to a combination i-line/KrF method  to see which could ensure a deeper focal depth. The distortion  gap between the lens systems appeared as pattern misplacement.    The results of that comparison showed that when the  difference between the two was greater than 0.06, a large  margin of error had to be allowed in alignment when printing  with KrF lithography, and that the holes had to be designed  smaller. The focal depth got shallower even with KrF  lithography. On the other hand, with a discrepancy less than  0.06, the combination of lithographies enabled a deeper  focal  depth.    For example, with 0.35 holes, the focal depth was  0.9  when printed with i-line alone. If i-line was used in  combination with KrF with a distortion gap of 0.25, the  focal  depth was 1.4.  Footnotes    1. The 14 companies referred to here are NEC, Toshiba,  Hitachi, Fujitsu, Mitsubishi, Oki Electric, Matsushita Electric,  Samsung Electronics (S. Korea), Gold Star Electronics (S.  Korea), Hyundai Electronic Industries (S. Korea), Texas  Instruments (US), IBM (US), Micron Semiconductor (US), and  Siemens (Ger). These include two joint ventures, namely, Hitachi  and Texas Instruments, and IBM and Siemens. There is a  possibility that Fujitsu and Hyundai Electronics, which  announced in October a basic agreement to work together on the  manufacture of 4M and 16M chips, may work jointly together in  the future to develop a 64M chip.    2. The main/secondary configuration consists of four  secondary word lines (polycides) connected to a single main word  line (first aluminum wiring layer). The width of a wiring line  itself is equal in thickness to the 2.4 aluminum line  spacing. When printing, the focus of the fine patterns is set to  match the peripheral circuits. As for memory arrays, the  difference in arrays causes a loss of focus, but since the  patterns are fat, NEC has reported no electrical problems.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / The Rail Dispute: More lines to operate today British Rail hopes to run a fuller train service today than on any of the three previous strike-bound Wednesdays as it brings a growing number of signal boxes into service. Railtrack, which operates the track and signalling, said the train companies had been able to increase services because signal staff were being used to greater effect. There was not expected to be any increase in the number of signal staff reporting for work. British Rail said it expected between 1,700 and 1,750 trains to run. Last Wednesday BR ran about 1,600 trains. Train operating companies have made a special effort to keep travellers informed. In London, Victoria and Waterloo stations will be open for the first time. BR's South Eastern division will run trains into Victoria from Ashford and Sevenoaks and from Orpington and Bromley. South West Trains will run a service from Epsom and Chessington via Wimbledon into Waterloo. Regional Railways will run trains between Swansea and Cardiff and the Cardiff Valleys line will run between Penarth, Cardiff and Bute Road. InterCity East Coast will run trains from York via Newcastle to Edinburgh while Regional Railways will operate a York-Newcastle-Berwick service. On most routes a special timetable will operate with trains running every 30 or 60 minutes. Some lines will run more frequent shuttle services. There will be extra parking in London for coaches in Battersea and Victoria Parks and for cars in Hyde Park, Regent's Park and Greenwich Park. Free car parking will be available at Tooting Bec Common, Royal Albert Dock and Greenland Pier in Surrey Quays. Additional services will run on the River Thames between Greenwich, the Tower of London and Charing Cross Pier. A special river service for up to 200 passengers will run from Gravesend and Tilbury to London Bridge and Charing Cross. A single boat will leave Gravesend at 6.45am returning from Charing Cross at 5pm.</p>

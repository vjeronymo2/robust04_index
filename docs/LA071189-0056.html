			<p><P> July 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III testified in New York that his longtime  friend and former lawyer E. Robert Wallach never sought preferential treatment  for the Wedtech Corp. Meese also testified at Wallach's racketeering trial that  Wallach never asked him to intervene in the investigation of the now-defunct  military contractor. Wedtech, once a small machine shop in New York City's  South Bronx, grew into a $100-million government contractor through a Small  Business Administration program that set aside no-bid contracts for  minority-controlled companies. Wallach; W. Franklyn Chinn, 47, a former Wedtech  board member and one-time Meese financial adviser; and an associate of theirs,  R. Kent London, are charged with extracting almost $2 million in illegal  payoffs and payments from Wedtech to influence Meese and other government  officials.  </P></p>

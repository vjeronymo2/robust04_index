			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Han Jianguo (7281 1696 0948): "China's Largest Gold </F> Mine Has Been Discovered in Fuxin, Liaoning Province"]    [Text] The Paishanlou Gold Mine--China's largest gold  mine, has been discovered in the Fuxin Mongolian Nationality  Autonomous County in Liaoning Province.    The mine was surveyed and discovered by the Liaoning  Provincial Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources. Since the  bureau was founded in 1989, it has organized eight geological  teams and has spent three years carrying out geological  prospecting activities in a block section [kuai duan 1040 3008]  of 800 meters. The geological prospecting results show that the  Paishanlou Gold Mine belongs to the tough shear belt metamorphic  hydrothermal type. It is a new type of cold deposit which has  been discovered in China for the first time. It is  characterized by a large scale, a single mineral, a high  percentage of gold, shallow storage, and easy extraction and  selection. The gold reserves total 430 tonnes. This is the  most exceptionally large gold mine ever discovered in China.    The mine is a key development project in the Eighth  Five-Year  Plan. The state will invest 200 million yuan and will build the  mine into China's largest comprehensive modern gold mine,  complete with an extraction, selection, and smelting process.    The feasibility study of the mine and its overall design  have  been completed, and its preliminary work is underway. The mine  is expected to become fully operational in 1995.</p>

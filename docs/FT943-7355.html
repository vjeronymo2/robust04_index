			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Dear Leader's succession may be in trouble The delay in the official appointment of Mr Kim Jong-il to the top leadership positions in North Korea is fuelling speculation in Seoul that his assumption of power may be in trouble following the death of his father, President Kim Il-sung, six weeks ago. A report yesterday by South Korea's state news agency that leaflets denouncing Mr Kim were scattered in the foreign diplomatic section of Pyongyang is the latest in a recent spate of largely unconfirmed stories claiming that the Dear Leader may be facing growing opposition to his rule. The incident coincides with a North Korean radio broadcast that warned that 'acts of betrayal by ambitious persons and conspirators' could undermine the ruling party unless the issue of Mr Kim's succession is solved soon. But there is otherwise little solid evidence to determine if Mr Kim is losing control of the secretive country. Speculation about his status has been fuelled by his failure so far to be named to the three most powerful positions in the country: general-secretary of the ruling Korean Workers' party, national president, and chairman of the party's central military committee. His absence from public view since his father's lavish funeral in mid-July has also caused uncertainty, although Mr Kim is known for being reclusive. The haggard appearance of the 52-year-old Mr Kim at the funeral services prompted rumours he is in poor health. The diplomatic corps in Pyongyang has speculated for years on the issue. Seoul government analysts, who believe that the delay in Mr Kim's takeover may be due to his failing health, have cited as evidence North Korean broadcasts that quote citizens wishing him good health. North Korean diplomats abroad have dismissed talk about a problem in the succession, explaining that the delay in the transfer of power is due to an extended period of mourning for the dead that is traditional in Korea. Some western analysts in Seoul agree with that explanation. 'It might appear unseemly for Kim Jong-il to take charge quickly. It could take several months for the party and parliament formally to convene and nominate him to the leadership posts,' Mr Michael Breen, an analyst for Merit Consultancy in Seoul. But he added that if the transfer of power is not completed by the end of the year, it could signify that Mr Kim is indeed in trouble. Many analysts agree with the recent assessment by Mr Lee Hong-koo, the South Korean deputy prime minister for national unification, that Mr Kim may be delaying his formal assumption of power until he arranges a reshuffle of top officials and promotes a younger generation of technocrats loyal to him. This could be a 'complex and time-consuming process' in a society based on a strong hierarchical structure, Mr Lee declared. The most serious source of opposition to Mr Kim is believed to be from the military-backed old guard who supported his father, but distrust the younger Kim's revolutionary credentials because of his supposed belief in economic reforms and the gradual opening of the isolated country to the outside world. North Korea may now be following a common historical pattern in Korea in which the death of a powerful leader usually triggers a generational shift in leadership. One indication that Mr Kim may be successful in achieving control was the recent return of his step-brother and potential rival, Mr Kim Pyong-il, to Helsinki as North Korean ambassador after spending several months in Pyongyang. If the power transfer is proceeding smoothly, analysts expect Mr Kim will assume formal leadership either on September 9, the anniversary of the establishment of North Korean state in 1948, or October 10, the 49th anniversary of the founding of the ruling party. The US and South Korea will be closely watching for any changes in North Korea's recent framework agreement to open its nuclear facilities to international inspections. A retreat by Pyongyang on this accord could indicate the growing strength of the North Korean military in a possible power struggle. South Korea is reluctant to hold a proposed summit meeting with North Korea, postponed because of the death of President Kim, until the Pyongyang succession is completed.</p>

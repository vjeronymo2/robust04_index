Larsen report: "Iran's Response -- Expels </F> Norwegian Consul"]    [Text] Two days after Norway expelled Iranian Consul  Mohammad Movahed, Iran has retaliated by expelling Arne Lundby,  Norway's consul in Tehran.    "Norwegian Ambassador Birger Bye was yesterday summoned to  the Foreign Ministry in Tehran and was told that Consul Arne  Lundby, the second in command at the Norwegian Embassy, must  leave the country before 4 April," acting Foreign Ministry press  spokesman Arthur Baste Knudsen said.    The Foreign Ministry is as yet undecided whether and how to  respond to the expulsion from Iran. After the expulsion, the  Iranian Embassy in Oslo has five employees with diplomatic  accreditation, while Norway has two employees with the same  status after the expulsion of Lundby.    Lundby has been on vacation in Norway and was expected back  in Tehran in the early hours of Monday morning [28 March].  Birger Bye, Norway's ambassador in Tehran, was not available by  telephone on Sunday.    "We gave a clear reason for our expulsion and do not think  that this reaction from Iran is fitting," Baste Knudsen said.  The Foreign Ministry's official reason for the expulsion was  that the Iranian consul engaged in activities that were  incompatible with his diplomatic status. A high-ranking source  in the Foreign Ministry told DAGBLADET on Saturday that Movahed  had been spying on his fellow countrymen in Norway. Baste  Knudsen was unwilling to confirm this. Four Iranian diplomats  have been expelled from Sweden for the same reason.    According to the NRK/Dagsrevyen program, Iranian radio  announced on Sunday that the Norwegian consul had been expelled  because he had engaged in activities incompatible with his  diplomatic status. According to the Foreign Ministry, no  official explanation has been given for the expulsion of Consul  Lundby. The Foreign Ministry therefore considers that the  expulsion is a retaliation.    Consul Lundby has worked in Iran since last fall. He has  also served as embassy secretary in Canada.</p>

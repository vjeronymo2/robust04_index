			<p>920626 FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Working time directive will affect UK the most THE European Community's working time directive, now limping towards the EC statute book, will have only a marginal effect on working time in most EC countries. But, eventually, it could come to be seen as a watershed in UK industrial relations. Britain, and to a lesser extent Ireland and Denmark, will for the first time have to introduce statutory minimum employment rights covering the working week, annual holidays, night shifts and minimum daily rest periods. The UK government has succeeded in stripping out what it found most objectionable, and UK and European employers' bodies have generally welcomed the outcome for a directive that most of them opposed in principle. Equally, the trade union vision of a net of basic Europe-wide minimum standards at work has edged forward enough for Mr Norman Willis, president of the European Trades Union Congress, to hail the agreement as a 'major step'. The most critical response came from the UK Institute of Directors which said: 'We have conceded to the EC the right to lay down Britain's labour laws. This deal opens the door for the many other social and employment measures which the EC has lined up.' In fact, the EC has already laid down labour laws relating to mobility, health and safety, and written contracts of employment, among other things, and after the exhausting dispute over the working time directive there is unlikely to be a rush into further legislation. Indeed, the working time directive itself has still not been passed. There is an 'understanding' between the 12 employment ministers covering most important aspects of the directive but a dispute between the French and German governments has held up a final deal, probably until December. A further three years then elapse before the directive becomes law. Several categories of worker, such as the self-employed, and some industries, such as transport, are indefinitely exempted. In the UK, most attention has been focused on the proposed 48-hour limit on the working week - averaged over at least three months - and the suggestion that Sunday should 'in principle' be the day of rest. The Sunday proposal has been diluted and the UK has won a special exemption allowing overtime over 48 hours provided it is voluntary. Britain will, however, have to provide legal protection for workers who do not want to work more than 48 hours a week, and employers may have to keep additional working time records. The other 11 countries - where employees will not be allowed to work over 48 hours - will only have to make small changes to present arrangements. As the table shows, most of the 11 already have weekly or daily limits. When overtime, itself restricted, is added, some employees in those countries do currently breach the 48 hour limit by a few hours. The other important proposals in the directive are: minimum three weeks' paid holiday rising to four weeks in 1999; an eight-hour limit on night shifts; an 11-hour minimum daily rest period and 35 hours' consecutive rest once a week. All the above - except for the holiday proposal - are subject to revision if employers and employees agree at local or national level. The holiday legislation will affect Germany which has a minimum of 18 days; Greece, where there is no paid holiday for the first year; Ireland which has three weeks and Italy which has no minimum. But UK employers will be most affected. The Low Pay Unit estimates that 1.3m employees have no paid leave at all and 3m have less than four weeks.

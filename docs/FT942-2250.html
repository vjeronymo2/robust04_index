			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / Survey of Electricity in Europe (7): Poland freshens the tainted air of freedom - The bid to clean up Cracow's power plant From the elegant, cobbled streets in the heart of Cracow, people cannot see the power plant that supplies their electricity. But on an overcast day, they can certainly smell it. After the huge steel works located just outside the town, Cracow's Heat and Power plant is the biggest polluter of the district's air. That is just one of the legacies of the past which the plant's managers are now trying to tackle. However progress so far has been frustratingly slow, stalled by repeated shifts in government policies on foreign finance and privatisation. Mr Krzysztof Ebro-Prokesz, the plant's strategy and implementation manager, stresses that the plant's success in achieving its hopes 'is important for the whole Polish energy sector. This plant is the pilot showing the way to bring in capital to modernise the sector'. It will, though, be a long haul. Demand for electricity is currently running below 1986 levels because of the slump in industrial activity as the economy restructures, although the plant's managers expect it now to climb steadily. While pollution from the plant has improved during the slump, it will rise again as output increases. So too will the costs of the plant's pollution permits. In 1993, it paid 44bn zlotys in fees to local environmental protection agencies for the right to release gases into the air. The plant's main environmental concern, according to Mr Janusz Danko, in charge of environmental protection, is nitrogen oxides, known collectively as 'nox'. The gases can cause breathing difficulties and contribute to acid rain. Poland has agreed with European Union countries that it will reduce nox emissions sharply by 1998. At Cracow, they are keen to install low-nox burners which would cut emissions by up to half. Sulphur emissions - the other big cause of acid rain - are less of a concern, as the plant burns Polish coal which is low in sulphur by European standards. The managers are consequently unwilling to invest in expensive flue-gas desulphurisation equipment, of the kind now being fitted to many power stations in Western Europe. But these improvements - of output and cleanliness - are near-impossible without restructuring and more finance. The plant has already spawned two subsidiaries to look after maintenance and transport, as a first step in reducing its labour force. In 1992, the managers began to explore the possibility of World Bank funding, but the bank wanted the plant itself to make a financial contribution. The plant's original plans for a joint venture with a foreign company were shelved when the government indicated that it preferred to sell a stake in the company, in order to raise funds for the Treasury as well as enabling a capital injection into the company. Instead, the managers turned to possible foreign partners, including Electricite de France (EDF). However, government officials have also suggested that the local government could be a partner. Decisions on the plant's future ownership have now been suspended until after local government elections on June 19. The plant is not short of plans, but until the government's stance on the industry becomes clearer, the finance for modernisation is tantalisingly just out of reach.</p>

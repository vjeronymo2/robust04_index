			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Merck promotes money-back guarantee for prostate drug Merck, the biggest drugs company in the US, is offering satisfaction to users of its prostate drug Proscar or a refund on the cost of the drug. The drug is designed to treat the enlargement of the prostate gland, a condition commonly seen in men over the age of 50. The enlargement causes difficulty in urinating and can in extreme cases lead to kidney failure. Surgery is the treatment of last resort. In the scheme it is testing, Merck will refund the Dollars 275-plus (Pounds 175-plus) cost of a course of Proscar if the drug fails to improve the patient's condition after six months. Money will also be refunded if the patient needs surgery within two years. The scheme has so far proved popular, having been taken up by 30 Veterans Administration hospitals and 11 health management organisations - companies which specialise in buying healthcare services from hospitals and doctors. Merck will not reveal what the refund rate has been. But clinical trials have suggested that 80 per cent of men respond favourably to the drug. The improvement is usually apparent within two weeks of starting the course of treatment. The company concedes, nevertheless, that Proscar, which was launched in 1992, had a difficult start with sales growth slower than expected. It was a new approach to treating enlarged prostates 'and doctors are conservative', Merck said. Mr Vincent Lawson, managing director of the company's UK operation, Merck Sharp and Dohme, said the money-back promotion was 'a real sharing of risk with real effects if promises are not kept'. He acknowledged that the prospect of money-back guarantees might be 'terrifying' for some in the drugs industry. Merck said it could be some time before a similar scheme was introduced outside the US. The US healthcare industry is largely privately owned and fragmented, with individual hospitals able to make commercial decisions. The UK-based Glaxo, Europe's biggest drug company, said it was not using such techniques to sell its drugs.</p>

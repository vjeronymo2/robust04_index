			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Democrat race intensifies as Clinton attacks Brown MR Bill Clinton, stung by defeat in Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary in Connecticut, yesterday gave up trying to ignore Mr Jerry Brown. The front-runner for the party nomination described the policies of his conqueror, a former governor of California, as typical of a 'charter member of the flat earth society'. He told a news conference in New York, scene of the next big primary two weeks from now, that Mr Brown's proposed flat rate of income and value-added taxes would be 'a disaster - a war-on-New York tax'. It would, he said, 'triple taxes on the poor, increase taxes on the middle class by an average Dollars 1,900 a year, and lower taxes on rich Americans'. But Mr Brown immediately flew in the afternoon to Albany, capital of New York state, to meet the state's most powerful politician, Governor Mario Cuomo, who is barely on speaking terms with Mr Clinton after the latter had suggested he might have Mafia connections. The Californian was only given ten minutes with the governor and received no endorsement. Asked if he agreed with Mr Brown that Mr Clinton would be 'the ruin of the Democratic party', Mr Cuomo merely replied he would only say such a thing if he were running himself. But, thickening the plot, a leader of the 'draft Cuomo' movement in New York said that, if Democrats there really wanted their governor to run for president, then a vote for Mr Brown would best serve that end. The tendency of the Democratic party's national leaders yesterday was to rally behind Mr Clinton, largely because Mr Brown is seen as unelectable in November. Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, an earlier candidate for the Democratic nomination, was meeting Mr Clinton last night with a view to an endorsement today. His union backing may help blunt Mr Brown's appeal to organised labour. Mr Ron Brown, party chairman, pointed out that Mr Clinton still had an enormous lead in delegates won. But defeat in New York and in Wisconsin, which also holds its primary on April 7, would encourage the search for an alternative candidate, though it would not necessarily produce one. On Tuesday, Mr Brown narrowly beat Mr Clinton, governor of Arkansas, by 37-36 per cent, with Mr Paul Tsongas, who pulled out of the race last week but remained on the ballot, scoring 20 per cent. Even so, the rules meant that Mr Clinton won more delegates to the party nominating convention in July, with 22 against Mr Brown's 21, and ten for Mr Tsongas. On the Republican side, President George Bush again was embarrassed by a one-third vote against his candidacy, even though he had little formal opposition. Mr Pat Buchanan won 22 per cent, uncommitted delegates took 9 per cent and the Louisiana rightwinger Mr David Duke 2 per cent. Disenchanted Democrats, Page 7</p>

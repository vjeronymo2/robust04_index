			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> ANTIC SHORT STORIES ARE LIGHTER THAN AIR  </P> <P> Men Under Water by Ralph Lombreglia (Doubleday: $17.95: 212 pages).  </P> <P> As with most good short-story writers, Ralph Lombreglia's work cuts to the  bone. In his case, unusually, it is often the funny-bone.  </P> <P> With its careful self-absorption and its circuitry of personal relations so  complex as to regularly short out, modern life is a trap. A Lombreglia  protagonist, generally the narrator, has followed so many subtle instructions  so conscientiously that he has worked himself into passive depression. The way  out is not more subtlety, but outrageousness.  </P> <P> Outrageousness we get a lot of these days, but it tends to be synthetic; a  formulaic excess along the lines of a "War of the Roses." The genuine article  is a rarity. It is not a willed choice. It is logic backed against its will  into a corner so tight that it has no alternative to leaping out into space. In  the best stories in "Men Under Water," the leap is not only instructive but  fun; it is a flying lesson, something learned in the air.  </P> <P> The narrator in "Jungle Video," one of the best of the stories, gets out of his  corner with the help of the three antic spirits he works for. Anita, Dwight and  the Professor make videos in a broken-down house in Boston. The narrator,  aimless and inhibited, lives downstairs as their tenant. Before long, they hire  him as a writer.  </P> <P> He is skillful but conventional; they are moonbeams. A computer company hires  them to do a video to promote its image. They prepare a straightforward  treatment; then they rip it apart in the wild, far-out style they win prizes  for. The company representative is furious; the video doesn't even show his  president. It is a frequent tribal custom, the Professor -- an anthropologist  -- explains loftily, that the chief does not take part in the ceremonies.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, they will redo it. Meanwhile, they clue in the bewildered  narrator. Clients don't know what they want, Dwight explains, but they think  that they do. If you do what they think they want, instead of what you know you  should do, they will be disappointed. Even if they're not, you will be. The  point is not to make videos but to be "brilliant media wizards."  </P> <P> They all go to a video-game arcade and play a game in which an ape has to pick  up a proliferating array of bananas. Of course, Dwight explains, it's not the  ape who does it but the players. "But in seeing it as the ape's situation you  get this peculiar distance on yourself."  </P> <P> "It becomes something apart from you," the narrator ventures.  </P> <P> "You become something apart from you."  </P> <P> "You become the ape."  </P> <P> "Yes," Dwight says.  </P> <P> By the end, the narrator, dressed in a gorilla suit, is cavorting uninhibitedly  as the subject for the trio's even wilder remake of the company video. He has  freed himself; he has also become the ape. Lombreglia's message cuts cheerfully  both ways.  </P> <P> In "Good Year," two lovers, on the verge of a depressive separation, drive out  to visit friends in the country. On the way, their spirits lift momentarily  when they catch sight of the Goodyear blimp floating by, silvery and  improbable. The narrator gets out to watch, and his girlfriend is "tickled by  how much I like it."  </P> <P> The friends, whose exuberance is on the order of the video trio's, drive them  later that day to the field where the blimp is moored. The husband has put on a  kid's space helmet and carries a toy ray-gun; he performs a mock marriage  ceremony for the low-spirited couple.  </P> <P> " 'I have here two sample earthlings,' " he intones to the blimp. " 'They have  not been happy on this planet, and have volunteered to leave. I offer them in  exchange for information about your world. Take us to your leader.' " If blimps  can tug upward, why not people?  </P> <P> Most of the stories have an equivalent moment of breaking free. Two or three  seem a little forced in these moments. "Monarchs," on the other hand, manages  with astonishing success to use a swarm of butterflies as an emblem of  happiness. Another, wickedly funny, tells of Edgar, whose girlfriend has walked  out, leaving all her things behind, and of the trendy museum curator who  persuades him to turn their house and mingled possessions into a "Museum of the  Love Affair."  </P> <P> There will be a "Before Each Other Room" containing his stuff, then a group of  rooms with the things they use together. In the last room, Edgar will sit in a  rocking chair, clutching her negligee. Not only can he make a living at it, the  curator explains, but it will be therapeutic for him.  </P> <P> "Inn Essence," the initial story, is a lovely Lombreglian extravaganza. The  narrator is the sensible but anemic still-center of a comically instructive  whirlwind. He is the salad chef at a country restaurant.  </P> <P> The place features a brilliant but insane pastry chef and five Thai students  whom the owner, an enthusiast of Eastern culture, has hired as waiters. It also  features the owner's long-suffering mistress, Ethel, whom he never quite  marries.  </P> <P> Victor, the pastry chef, attempts to stab one of the Thai students; they clamor  for justice. The owner's version of justice is to reward everybody. He proposes  to give both sides enormous raises. "Money is love," he explains. It is no use.  Victor denounces the Thais to the authorities, and two immigration inspectors  arrive.  </P> <P> At this point, Ethel rouses from her gloom and brings about an extravagant  salvation. When the inspectors get there, the waiters have disappeared and so  has Victor. The narrator finds them all in the pastry cooler. Victor is tied  up; Ethel and the Thais are bombarding him with cream puffs and stuffing his  mouth with pastry cream.  </P> <P> "Five young men from a distant land are looking at me with questioning eyes,  the sweet pastries of revenge in their hands," the narrator says. "They're  waiting for me to confirm that whatever we are doing is indeed the way justice  is done in my country."  </P> <P> It is the last of many deflections in a story as light and flaky as one of the  pastries, built upon a lacework of misunderstandings and ricochets, and lifting  off with the buoyancy of the Goodyear blimp.  </P> <P> Friday: Elaine Kendall reviews "A Slight Lapse" by Robert Chibka, (W.W.  Norton).  </P></p>

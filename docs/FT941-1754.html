			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / White House urged to act over Haiti President Bill Clinton's policy towards Haiti yesterday came under fierce attack from some of his most reliable supporters. The Congressional Black Caucus, representing 40 African-American members of Congress, urged Mr Clinton in a letter to scrap his Haitian policy and take a tougher approach to the task of restoring ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. The caucus urged Mr Clinton to cut air links with Haiti, deny visas to the Haitian military and impose sanctions on any country violating the United Nations embargo on trade with the Caribbean nation. Many of the caucus's members - including Congressman Kweisi Mfume, its chairman, and such senior congressmen as Mr Bill Clay of Missouri and Mr Louis Stokes of Ohio - also signed an open letter published yesterday in the New York Times accusing the administration of racism in its policy towards Haitian refugees. The letter, signed by mayors, actors, singers and civic leaders, complains the US has 'effectively sealed Haitian political refugees into the death chamber of their own island,' while offering safe haven to refugees from countries like Vietnam, and Cuba. 'In no other case, against no other people has our nation employed measures of automatic repatriation. Why just the Haitians? One is left to reasonably conclude that our policy is driven by considerations of race,' the letter says.</p>

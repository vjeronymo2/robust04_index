			<p><P> April 21, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADDING NEW TOWNS TO MAP -- SOLUTIONS OR NEW WOES?  </P> <P> Don't bother running to a map of California.  </P> <P> Lakeborough doesn't exist yet, except in the minds of some developers who hope  next year to begin building a town from scratch for 28,000 residents on what is  now 4,300 acres of arid Central Valley farmland.  </P> <P> Like a handful of other new communities on the drawing boards in California --  with colorful names such as Mountain House and Rancho San Benito -- Lakeborough  is designed to help ease the Bay Area housing crunch.  </P> <P> Bay Area residents increasingly are flocking to ever-distant suburbs in quest  of affordable homes, despite often staggering commutes on clogged highways to  offices in the East Bay or factories in Silicon Valley.  </P> <P> And in the next decade, hundreds of thousands more people are expected to pour  into California, further straining the housing supply.  </P> <P> With new towns, proponents say, carefully planned houses, roads, jobs,  firehouses, police stations, town halls, schools and recreational facilities  could be created in a self-contained spot, making it easier for residents to  live and play where they work and thereby avoiding the pitfalls of sprawling  subdivisions.  </P> <P> But opponents fear that new towns will simply devour prized farmland and end up  as isolated burgs, adding to the criss-cross congestion they propose to ease.  Some skeptics denounce the explosion of new town proposals as simply a  glorified marketing ploy by developers.  </P> <P> "There's a lot to be said for the notion of designing new towns," said Thomas  Cook, director of housing and land-use for the Bay Area Council, a San  Francisco-based group that promotes regional thinking. "But it's not clear to  me that some of the optimistic projections of developers for a balance of jobs  and housing will be realized."  </P> <P> The rash of proposals has set up a classic confrontation between developers on  one side, who see the potential for hefty profits, and advocates of slow growth  and farmland preservation on the other.  </P> <P> Consider Trimark Communities, the Tracy-based developer of Mountain House, a  town for 30,000 residents proposed for the dry, windy foothills of southwestern  San Joaquin County between Livermore and Tracy off Interstate 580. Trimark just  submitted a formal application after spending three years and millions of  dollars on environmental, engineering and other studies.  </P> <P> During that time, it prepared 15 versions of its plan in response to ecological  and other concerns. It cut the project in half after Alameda County, site of  half the original acreage, opposed development of its agricultural land.  </P> <P> But the project is still two to five years from winning the needed approvals  and breaking ground, and the first phase would not be completed until 2010 or  so, according to Kitty Walker, senior planner for San Joaquin County.  </P> <P> "It's not a development for the faint of heart," acknowledged Timothy A. Tosta,  a San Francisco attorney advising Trimark. "It requires enormous patience,  enormous vision and very deep pockets."  </P> <P> The idea of making towns out of whole cloth is scarcely new. About 1900, a  British city planner named Ebenezer Howard, seeking to stem the flow of  job-hungry rural residents into already crowded cities, proposed the creation  of self-sufficient "garden cities" that would offer urban amenities but would  be surrounded by farmland.  </P> <P> Two such towns arose in England in Howard's lifetime; they served as models for  towns organized by the government after World War II. (Howard was knighted in  1927.)  </P> <P> In the United States, Reston, Va., and Columbia, Md., both built in the 1960s,  top planning experts' lists of successful new towns.  </P> <P> Roger E. Simon Jr. was the force behind Reston, although start-up costs forced  him to sell out to the real estate subsidiary of a giant oil company. Today the  town has more than 40,000 residents.  </P> <P> Columbia, founded by James W. Rouse's Rouse Co. in 1967, has more than 70,000  people and expects to have 100,000 at full development. Promotional material  crows that "each year, Columbia is becoming more and more the thriving, vibrant  community envisioned in the midst of rural Howard County just a few short years  ago."  </P> <P> With those notable exceptions, new town development in this country has largely  flopped. There was a flurry of government interest in the 1960s, when the  Department of Housing and Urban Development supported a dozen proposals with  loan guarantees.  </P> <P> Most of those projects defaulted because of poor locations, economic downturns,  high land costs, environmental challenges or the inability to attract jobs.  </P> <P> When the synthetic fuels industry collapsed in the early 1980s in Colorado, for  example, Exxon Corp. scaled back plans for a proposed town called Battlement  Mesa on the Colorado River and began peddling it as a retirement community.  </P> <P> Irvine Co.'s "master planned community" of Irvine in Orange County occasionally  makes a list of successful new towns. But critics have maintained that its  tight design controls and upscale nature have made it sterile and that it lacks  the "sense of place" of a true new town.  </P> <P> Frequently mentioned as a model town is Seaside, a tiny Florida locale designed  by Miami-based architect Andres Duany, who happened to be attorney Tosta's  roommate at Princeton. Widely praised as bringing back such 19th-Century  touches as strolling, front porches and picket fences, it has primarily  succeeded as a resort.  </P> <P> In advocating new towns for California, developers point to the uncontrolled  spillover that has afflicted urban areas and spawned anti-growth movements.  They say that by paying attention to such issues as long-term livability and  town governance they can improve on traditional subdivisions and create  socially beneficial environments.  </P> <P> "People are becoming dissatisfied with some of the present patterns of  development," said Bruce W. Liedstrand, former city manager of Mountain View,  Calif., and now head of Liedstrand Associates, a San Francisco-based firm that  devised the Mountain House concept, which features a series of neighborhoods  each centered on a village hall.  </P> <P> To qualify as a true new town, a development must have four basic ingredients,  according to Reid Ewing, a senior planner with an Orlando, Fla., design firm  that is working on several new town projects throughout the country. Ewing is  author of "New Community Development Guide," which the Urban Land Institute in  Washington expects to publish soon.  </P> <P> A new town must have at least 2,000 acres and 20,000 people upon completion; it  must have a balanced mix of land-uses, with jobs, recreation and services  within easy reach of housing, thereby promoting walking instead of driving; it  must have been master-planned before any construction was begun, and all land  must be owned and controlled initially by a single property owner.  </P> <P> New towns are "like a blank tablet," Ewing said, with the developer ensuring  that all uses are "consistent with the vision."  </P> <P> But one harsh opponent dismisses the concept as "bogus."  </P> <P> "It's usually an excuse to look for cheap land and put up a subdivision," said  Larry Orman, executive director of the Greenbelt Alliance, a 30-year-old  nonprofit group dedicated to preserving open space. "The amount of housing  they'll build is trivial compared to the overall need."  </P> <P> Clearly, something has to give if California is to handle its frenzied growth.  </P> <P> Planners point to once-sleepy farm towns such as Modesto and Stockton that have  erected countless subdivisions and become bedroom communities for the Bay Area.  </P> <P> Even unlikely places such as Patterson (population 6,700), an agricultural  outpost in Stanislaus County that is the self-proclaimed "apricot capital of  the world," is growing like Topsy, with asphalt and houses sprouting on the  rich farmland.  </P> <P> "Everybody's sliding over from the Bay Area; housing is going nuts," said Marty  Pupka, who with his wife, Gail, recently bought the Pizza Plus restaurant in  Patterson and moved from Fresno.  </P> <P> In many cases, Pupka said, houses have been shoddily built in developers' zeal  to quickly capitalize on the trend.  </P> <P> The prices of some newer homes in Patterson, residents say, have doubled or  tripled in the last two years, to nearly $200,000, hefty by Patterson's  standards but still well below the prices in San Francisco or San Jose.  </P> <P> "It's much easier to have a developer come in than to replant the orchards,"  Pupka said. "It's sad, but that's life."  </P> <P> About five miles south of Patterson is the hilly farmland that two Stanislaus  County families plan to sell to developer O'Brien &amp; Hicks for the new town  of Lakeborough.  </P> <P> Spotting an opportunity to create housing and jobs in an orderly way -- and to  profitably rid themselves of difficult-to-farm land -- the owners of Beltran  Farms and Sunflower Ranch pooled their properties in 1987 and asked the county  to designate the land for urban development for a town they proposed to call  Dos Ranchos. They were rebuffed.  </P> <P> Three years later, their project is apparently closest to breaking ground of  those being planned in California. If the necessary approvals come through,  construction of roads and sewer lines could begin as early as next year.  </P> <P> The breakthrough occurred largely because of Frank A. Borges, whose Santa Rosa  firm specializes in securing land-use permits. He hired a gaggle of consultants  to analyze the site in terms of air quality, traffic congestion, biological  concerns, water availability and even archeology, all in an attempt to head off  future problems.  </P> <P> He also found a good match in O'Brien &amp; Hicks, a San Mateo development firm  that shared the ranchers' concern that a new town be intelligently conceived  and executed.  </P> <P> Borges said his work entailed involving all potential adversaries in the  planning process. The development team met with a raft of grass-roots groups  and agencies, including the California Department of Fish and Game, the Army  Corps of Engineers, various water control boards, federal highway officials and  the U.S. Navy, which operates an auxiliary air station nearby.  </P> <P> Plans were devised to add two highway interchanges, at a cost of at least $10  million each.  </P> <P> All told, the firm expects to build 10,000 units of housing on 2,100 acres,  from low-density housing with five units to the acre to high-density  condominiums with 20 units per acre. Prices are expected to range from $89,000  to $300,000, although those could be driven higher if the developer must pick  up greater-than-expected infrastructure costs.  </P> <P> No employers have yet agreed to put offices there, but the town expects  ultimately to provide 15,000 jobs. Stanislaus County will require that the  developer devise a transportation plan, including car pools and staggered work  shifts, to limit vehicle use.  </P> <P> One of the first things O'Brien &amp; Hicks did was to change the project's  name to Lakeborough, to "evoke that water image," Reed said. He added that the  developer has obtained rights to water from both the California Aqueduct and  the Delta Mendota federal canal and that it is proposing the use of reclaimed  water for all irrigation.  </P> <P> Water will be a strong selling point in the parched Central Valley, which has  an average summer temperature of 94 degrees and average annual rainfall of just  12 inches. A century ago, before engineers brought irrigation water to the  valley, the land was suitable only for dry farming and grazing. (In winter, the  valley is chilled by dense tule fog, a boon for the orchards but a bane of  drivers.)  </P> <P> The difficulty of irrigating crops prompted the ranchers to consider selling  the properties, on which they grow walnuts, tomatoes, almonds, melons,  tangeloes and lima beans.  </P> <P> "We have to pay more to pump the water uphill," said Fred E. Beltran, whose  father in the 1940s farmed the sandy soil on which Los Angeles International  Airport now sits. "Our view is there's a lot of other ground that's easier and  better to farm on the valley floor. And affordable housing is something we  desperately need." The Beltran family plans to use its proceeds to buy other  farmland in Stanislaus County.  </P> <P> Of the 4,300 acres, about 1,000 is designated prime agricultural land, and  therein lies a potential hurdle.  </P> <P> The Stanislaus County Farm Bureau last year adopted a policy stating that  "under no circumstances should new towns be allowed on prime farmland or lands  of statewide importance." The bureau also opposes new town proposals that would  divert water from agricultural uses.  </P> <P> Jan Ennenga, executive manager of the Stanislaus County Farm Bureau, said the  agency has not yet taken a stance on the Lakeborough proposal. But in general  she fears that the loss of prime lands could ultimately cripple agriculture,  California's No. 1 industry.  </P> <P> Briggs Nisbet, a spokeswoman with the American Farmland Trust in San Francisco,  noted that prime land is being lost at the rate of nearly 20,000 acres a year  in the Central Valley.  </P> <P> "It would definitely be better if any new development went into less viable  soils," she said.  </P> <P> Cash-starved counties, however, are unlikely to resist the lure of such  development. Developers sell the idea that the communities will be  unincorporated and that businesses and residents therefore will contribute to  county coffers.  </P> <P> But "one of these days the yuppies and yuppie puppies will say we need a city  council, and then the fun starts," said Victor Holanda, planning director for  Stanislaus County.  </P> <P> Despite that, Holanda sees new towns as one way to grapple with growth  pressures. "Growth throughout the state is inevitable," he said. "By  accommodating the growth but deflecting it to non-prime (agricultural) land,  there is a dual benefit. The real challenge is to try to come up with the  jobs-housing balance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Planned 'New Town'  </P> <P> On 4,300 acres of Central Valley farmland, the development firm of O'Brien  &amp; Hicks is proposing to build a town from scratch called Lakeborough. If  all goes as planned, the town eventually will have 15,000 jobs and be home to  28,000 residents.  </P> <P> Commercial Office-Industrial:  </P> <P> Employers in office parks just off Interstate 5 are expected to range from  financial institutions to engineering firms to high-tech manufactures.  </P> <P> Low Density Residential:  </P> <P> About 5,000 single-family homes will be built on lots ranging from 3,500 square  feet to 12,000 square feet, with an average of eight houses per acre.  </P> <P> Medium Density Residential:  </P> <P> Condominiums and townhomes, as well as smaller, detached, single-family houses,  will be included in 2,000 housing units built 14 to the acre.  </P> <P> Med-High Density Residential:  </P> <P> These 3,000 units will include primarily rental apartments and townhomes, with  25 per acre.  </P></p>

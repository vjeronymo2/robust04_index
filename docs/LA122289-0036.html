			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMBAT IN PANAMA;  </P> <P> U.S. TROOPS NOW FACING UNCERTAIN PHASE OF MISSION;  </P> <P> MILITARY: AMERICANS MUST CONTEND WITH ELUSIVE REMNANTS OF NORIEGA'S  BEST-TRAINED TROOPS AND ROAMING BANDS OF YOUTHS.  </P> <P> A day after subduing most organized resistance mounted by the Panama Defense  Forces against their invasion, U.S. soldiers confronted one of the most shadowy  and uncertain phases of their mission Thursday.  </P> <P> As the American troops moved to restore order to a Panama City turned lawless,  they faced the elusive remnants of some of ex-strongman Manuel A. Noriega's  best-trained troops, as well as some of his most unpredictable, who are  shooting from rooftops, entering houses and roaming the streets in disorganized  bands.  </P> <P> Members of Noriega's special operations forces, many wearing black masks, are  sniping from rooftop perches, Pentagon officials said. Meanwhile, a rabble from  the so-called Dignity Battalion, some armed with AK-47 rifles and  rocket-propelled grenade launchers, threaten U.S. troops from the cover of  buildings. The Dignity Battalion consists of young, paramilitary Noriega  loyalists recruited from poor neighborhoods.  </P> <P> "We wanted to take down the PDF; we've pretty effectively done that," said Army  Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, director of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff. "We  wanted to restore law and order. We're doing that today (Thursday)."  </P> <P> However, Pentagon planners admitted that they still fear that such pro-Noriega  forces as Battalion 2000, which Wednesday fled its base north of Panama City,  might have retreated into Panama's dense jungles to regroup.  </P> <P> "We carry them as a possible future problem," said Kelly of the force.  Battalion 2000, which has 500 to 800 men, was established by Noriega in 1983 to  protect the Panama Canal when, under the terms of the Panama Canal Treaties  with the United States, the waterway is turned over to Panama in the year 2000.  The battalion was helpful to Noriega during the October coup attempt against  him, but Kelly said Thursday that it is not clear whether it remains intact.  </P> <P> Units from the 7th Infantry Division, based in Ft. Ord, Calif., and a brigade  of more than 300 military police from Ft. Bragg, N.C., arrived in Panama on  Thursday and joined Army Rangers and paratroopers who already had begun to  patrol Panama City's streets. The additions brought the total U.S. force to  22,500.  </P> <P> Kelly said that the 16th Military Police Brigade will allow local commanders to  establish communications that will permit the U.S. forces to perform "some  police functions in Panama City insofar as rounding people up and disarming  them are concerned."  </P> <P> Infantryman from the 82nd Airborne, riding in high-tech trucks called  "Hummers," rushed past rooftop snipers at the Marriott Hotel, where 29 American  and 35 foreign nationals were pinned down, and evacuated the civilians Thursday  morning. U.S. soldiers combed a second hotel for possible hostages.  </P> <P> At the same time, the Americans salvaged what Kelly described as "a large  cache" of PDF documents from the burned-out remains of Noriega's headquarters.  The documents were to be combed by military intelligence analysts and whisked  to Justice Department officials for use as evidence in the prosecution of  Noriega on drug-trafficking charges.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, other Army Rangers, as well as special operations forces, scoured  the countryside to bring in Noriega -- a task that Kelly called "one of our top  priorities."  </P> <P> Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, in an interview, said that the task of  mopping up "would be a little easier if Noriega wasn't dashing around the  country."  </P> <P> Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, the Joint Staff's intelligence chief, said Pentagon  intelligence analysts believe that Noriega remains in Panama. But he added that  there have been "innumerable reports" of sightings, including some that place  him in Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Colombia.  </P> <P> Fearing that Noriega might try to flee to Nicaragua or Cuba, U.S. soldiers kept  well-armed surveillance on those nations' embassies in Panama City, Pentagon  officials said. They denied reports that the embassies were surrounded by  tanks.  </P> <P> In preparation for an intensified manhunt, Pentagon officials said that the  operation's next step would be the deployment of some troops close to Panama's  northern border with Costa Rica. That section of Panama is a traditional  stronghold for the deposed dictator.  </P> <P> While many of the PDF's 7,300-man regular force appears to have disappeared  into Panama's civilian population or into the jungles, American forces by  Thursday morning had rounded up 1,500 prisoners, Pentagon officials said.  </P> <P> They estimated that by Thursday morning, 59 Panamanian soldiers had been killed  in the fighting and 66 wounded. They said they had no estimates of civilian  casualties, although Panamanian hospital officials estimated that hundreds of  civilians were treated for wounds.  </P> <P> By Thursday night, 21 U.S. servicemen had died in Panama and 208 were wounded.  Another four were missing.  </P> <P> As U.S. forces began the task of interrogating prisoners, Noriega's  brother-in-law, an officer in the PDF, contacted U.S. forces and offered to  surrender along with 15 fellow soldiers, according to Kelly.  </P> <P> U.S. soldiers also faced the delicate task of distinguishing Panamanian  civilians from straggling Panamanian troops intent on ambush.  </P> <P> Along with night-time parachute operations, which the 82nd Airborne conducted  early Wednesday morning, urban warfare "is one of the most difficult and  dangerous forms of maneuver there is," said Lt. Col. Bob Killebrew, a Pentagon  official who until two months ago commanded the 1st Battalion of the 82nd  Airborne's 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, now in Panama.  </P></p>

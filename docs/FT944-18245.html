			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (12): Rude shock dealt to the forecasters - The UK: after August's boom failed to materialise, the confidence seen earlier this year has disappeared The UK motor trade and industry has entered this year's final quarter in a state of unease and uncertainty. In the first seven months of the year confidence was riding high. The UK new car market was leading Europe out of recession faster than anyone had predicted. After their precipitate fall from the record 2.3m market that was achieved in 1989 to 1.59m by 1992, registrations had recovered to 1.78m last year and were up a further 14 per cent in this year's first half. With the approach of August, the 'boom' sales month unique to the UK because of its annual introduction of a new registration letter prefix, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders predicted August registrations could reach 0.5m, matching a level that has no been seen since 1989. To the industry's dismay, the boom did not materialise. August finished only 2.8 per cent ahead of last year at a mere 445,000 units. It also became apparent that the increase had been fuelled entirely by the company car sector making long-overdue replacements of its fleets. The SMMT's own statistics showed that there were substantially fewer private buyers in the market than in the previous year. Manufacturers and importers have therefore found themselves approaching the final quarter with unexpectedly high stocks, a renewed question mark over the underlying strength of the UK economic recovery and a rude shock to the already fragile consumer confidence that came in the form of the first rise in UK interest rates for five years. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, has warned that more rises are in store if inflation continues to edge upwards. To add to the last-quarter uncertainty, there are no indications that this year's Budget, due in late November, might contribute to the 'feelgood' factor so necessary for private motorists to commit themselves to a new car purchase. Against this background, the trade and industry has been retreating from earlier forecasts that this year could see the UK return to a 2m-plus market for the first time since 1990. Vauxhall, describing the recent interest rate rise as 'unhelpful', has scaled back its own forecast to 1.92m. Richard Ide, chief executive of Volkswagen/Audi's wholly-owned UK importer, maintains, however, that his company 'never subscribed to the notion of a half-a-million August'. It expects a 1.9m market this year, rising only slightly to 1.95m in 1995 and points out that the 60,000 cars built for buyers who did not materialise in August are going to leave market conditions extremely competitive for the foreseeable future. The German company, along with some other 'traditional' continental importers such as Peugeot Citroen and Fiat, has substantially outperformed the market this year, achieving unit sales gains of 23 per cent for Audi and 27 per cent - in large part a reflection of the greater freedom of choice being given to company car drivers. 'The executive/luxury sector is holding up well but it's almost all company money,' says Mr Ide. There appears to be little sign of company car drivers handing back their keys in a favour of a cash alternative - something which was widely predicted in some quarters following several years of company car benefit tax increases well above the rate of inflation and the adoption of a new tax regime this year based on a simple percentage of new cars' list prices. But where the new tax regime is having an effect is on the type of cars for which company car drivers are opting. Many are settling for simpler cars with fewer expensive options in order to reduce their personal taxation burden. Manufacturers insist, however, that there are few examples of drivers who have been entitled to an executive-level car opting for a much smaller and cheaper one, plus top-up cash. Meanwhile, most of the UK motor trade and industry is uniting to seek the abolition of the August registration letter prefix system. Conceived in the early 1960s, its declared aim was to help make the yearly sales pattern more even, by reducing what was then an unwieldy sales peak at the start of each calendar year. A useful proportion of buyers, the industry felt, would prefer the perceived one-upmanship of having the latest number plate letter in August. The undeclared hope was that the 'keeping up with the Joneses' element of the yearly letter would also sell more cars. For many years, the system appeared to achieve both goals. Yet by the mid-1980s the August sales bulge was already getting out of hand; far eclipsing the January sales peak and coming to account for almost one quarter of a full year's sales. It meant that by as early as May of each year, the 'let's wait for the new letter' syndrome was affecting sales. July, typically, now accounts for little more than 2 per cent of the yearly total. Thus dealers' cash flow has been dwindling at the very time that they need to acquire large stocks for the August 'boom', drawing manufacturers as well into ever more complex and costly stocking finance schemes. Not least, dealer workshops have tended to be crammed with new cars being prepared for delivery at the peak of the season - a factor hardly likely to be in the interest of customers, either. Finally, when August is over, the dealers face the problem of what to do with the mountain of trade-ins. In a recent poll commissioned by Automotive Management, more than 200 dealers voted six-to-one for the system to be scrapped. Most now appear to believe that whatever extra sales may have been generated in the past, they are no longer worth the market distortions caused. According to Sewells International, the marketing monitoring group, replacing the existing system with one spreading sales more evenly through the year could save the industry almost Pounds 1.5bn in stocking and related costs. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has set up a working party to investigate alternative systems and to try and reach agreement within the trade and industry on which one should finally be put forward to the government. It hopes to reach conclusions before the end of the year. More frequent letter changes, the issue of a 'personal' registration plate to the driver, and resurrecting a regional system are all coming under consideration. The outcome of the debate will be watched with particular interest by overseas car makers. The August prefix system is unique to the UK. Without it, continental Europeans in summer are interested in vacations, not buying new cars and demand in continental Europe slumps accordingly. For Fiat, Peugeot, Volkswagen and others, therefore, producing right-hand-drive cars for Britain's August 'boom' is a valued way of keeping assembly lines flowing. The UK car industry, however, is no longer an easy target for ambitious importers. On the contrary, car production this year might well reach a 21-year high as the result of prolonged, steady improvement since the early 1980s - when annual output dipped briefly below 900,000. Last year the UK industry produced 1.375m cars, a 6.4 per cent rise over a year earlier. The rise in the first half of this year is much smaller, only slightly more than 1 per cent (to 751,717). However, this was largely a reflection of production for export being affected by recession in the opening months of the year in continental Europe's markets. With most of these markets now growing again, the upward trend should shortly resume. Most industry analysts suggest that production will break through the 2m mark well before the end of the decade. However, this performance would have been achieved by the motor industry in Britain, not a British-owned industry. With the sale by British Aerospace of Rover Group to BMW of Germany this year, only a handful of small specialist companies such as Rolls-Royce and the Blackpool-based sports car manufacturer, TVR, are UK-owned. And most of the production expansion is being accounted for not by old-established companies such as Ford (still UK market leader) and General Motors' Vauxhall subsidiary, but the much more recent Japanese 'transplant' factories. Toyota started production of the Carine E (for Europe) upper-medium car range at the beginning of last year. By year-end it had built 37,000. Output jumped to 43,000 in this year's first half and industry analysts DRI McGraw-Hill project nearly 91,000 this year, rising to 200,000 by 1997 - by when, DRI predicts, Toyota will have introduced a second model, the smaller Corolla, to the Burnaston lines. Toyota has yet to confirm this; nor has it publicly given DRI any reason to predict that Toyota's output will reach nearly 300,000 before the end of the decade - well above the 200,000 capacity Toyota has so far indicated for the plant. However Honda, whose Swindon plant began producing the Accord upper-medium saloon at the end of 1992, and which is also about to start producing the smaller Civic, has already announced a Pounds 330m programme to expand Swindon's output to 150,000 cars a year by the end of the decade, from the 100,000 expected in 1995. Nissan, which made its decision to manufacture in the UK almost exactly 10 years ago, has also hinted that its current 200,000 capacity may be doubled by the end of the decade. It is unlikely that a similar announcement from Toyota will be very long delayed. Total Japanese output in the UK last year was 316,000 cars, 23 per cent of the total. Of these 237,000 were exported - some 45 per cent of the UK total. However, while the output of Ford and Vauxhall has fallen back, Rover's drive upmarket is continuing to pay it dividends. Expansion of its Land Rover four-wheel-drive activities is proceeding apace, thanks to soaring world-wide demand for its Discovery model, while a rash of new products in the next 18 months will include Rover's version of the new Honda Civic, the 400; a new 200 hatchback, an MG sports car and a Metro replacement. DRI, for one, believes that the various product programmes will see Rover producing more than 500,000 cars a year by 1997, compared with 407,000 last year.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK NEW CAR REGISTRATIONS JANUARY-AUGUST 1994  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Volume      Volume     Share (%)     Share (%)                        (Units)   Change(%)    Jan-Aug 94    Jan-Aug 93  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL MARKET         1,443,318        +9.8         100.0         100.0 UK produced            612,320        +4.7          42.4          44.5 Imports                830,998       +13.8          57.6          55.5 Japanese makes         171,570        +3.6          11.9          12.6 MANUFACTURERS: Ford group             321,975        +9.7          22.3          22.4  -Ford                 317,328        +9.9          22.0          22.0  -Jaguar                 4,647        -3.7           0.3           0.4 General Motors         242,028        +7.5          16.8          17.1  -Vauxhall             234,470        +7.4          16.3          16.6  -Saab*                  7,558        +8.9           0.5           0.5 BMW group              210,810        +4.3          14.6          15.3  -Rover**              176,370        +2.9          12.2          13.0  -BMW                   34,440       +12.6           2.4           2.3 Peugeot group          182,396        +8.5          12.6          12.8  -Peugeot              114,147        +8.1           7.9           8.0  -Citroen               68,249        +9.3           4.7           4.8 Volkswagen group        96,602       +27.8           6.7           5.8  -Volkswagen            58,653       +21.3           4.1           3.7  -Audi                  18,541       +27.5           1.3           1.1  -SEAT                  10,492       +54.3           0.7           0.5  -Skoda***               8,916       +50.5           0.6           0.5 Renault                 86,128       +21.8           6.0           5.4 Nissan                  68,471        +6.5           4.7           4.9 Fiat group****          45,314       +32.9           3.2           2.6  -Fiat                  43,950       +36.7           3.1           2.5  -Alfa Romeo             1,193       -21.6           0.1           0.1 Toyota                  38,294        -4.8           2.7           3.1 Volvo                   30,214        -5.4           2.1           2.4 Honda                   28,658       +35.0           2.0           1.6 Mercedes-Benz           21,801       +52.9           1.5           1.1 Mazda                   12,943        -4.5           0.9           1.0  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    * GM holds 50% of Saab Automobile and has management control.   ** Includes Range Rover and Discovery.  *** VW holds 31% of Skoda and has management control. **** Includes residual Lancia registrations.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

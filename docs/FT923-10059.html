			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / International Company News: Du Pont plans to reshape its electronics division DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group that is embarked upon a series of restructuring projects, yesterday unveiled plans to reorganise its electronics division. Effective from today, Du Pont will transfer its polyester and high performance films businesses from the electronics division to the Du Pont imaging systems and medical products organisation. The films business has annual revenues of about Dollars 550m, which means Du Pont's electronics division - which last year had about Dollars 1.8bn of revenues - will be left with less than Dollars 1.3bn of annual turnover. About 100 voluntary redundancies will be sought as a result of the move; the electronics division at present employs about 8,000. Mr Edgar Woolard, the Du Pont chairman, said that on November 1 management responsibility for the remaining electronic businesses will be transferred from the US to Japan. Mr Chad Holliday, president of Du Pont's Asia Pacific operations, will take over with responsibility for the printed circuit materials, microcircuit materials and semiconductor materials businesses in addition to his present activities. Du Pont will, meanwhile, proceed with the planned divestiture of the electronics division's connectors business, which is expected to take place by the year-end. The connectors business, which employs about 3,000, has annual revenues of about Dollars 450m, meaning that the electronics division Mr Holliday will take over will have total sales of about Dollars 800m. Mr Woolard said the electronics plan was aimed at strengthening the group's position as a materials supplier to the worldwide electronics industry.</p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Trinity back on takeover trail with Woodhead deal TRINITY International, publisher of the Liverpool Daily Post and Echo, has returned to the takeover trail with a Pounds 12.6m recommended cash offer for Joseph Woodhead of Huddersfield. The independent private company publishes and prints the Huddersfield Daily Examiner, a daily with a circulation of some 40,000. It also owns a number of local weekly and monthly titles and a small retail and commercial stationery business in Huddersfield. The acquisition comes less than a month after Chester-based Trinity agreed to buy 26 local newspapers of the Argus Press group in a deal worth Pounds 23m. The Argus deal, which will be examined by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, takes Trinity into the south of England newspaper market for the first time. Trinity, which has been intent on expanding its regional newspaper interests, will fund the Huddersfield acquisition from existing resources. The company owns local and regional newspapers in north-west England, North Wales, Canada and the US. Last year it bought Scottish and Universal Newspapers from Lonrho for Pounds 45m.</p>

The license provides, among other things, that the licensee, is subject to all rules, regulations, and orders of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now or hereafter in effect. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The facility consists of a pressurized water reactor at the licensee's site located in Westchester County, New York. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> By letter dated September 29, 1994, the licensee requested an amendment to the Technical Specifications (TSs) that would allow Residual Heat Removal (RHR) containment isolation valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 Type C local leak rate tests (LLRTs) to be performed during refueling outage (RFO) 9/10, scheduled for spring of 1996. In addition, the licensee's letter requested an exemption from the requirements of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) since 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, requires that licensees perform Type C tests during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years. Type C tests are LLRTs of containment isolation valves. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The licensee commenced operating on 24-month fuel cycles in August 1992, instead of the previous 18-month fuel cycles, starting with fuel cycle 9. The requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix J, Paragraph III.D.3, indicate that Type C LLRTs must be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling at intervals no greater than 2 years (24 months). On January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption that allowed Type C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30 months, thus, permitting operating on a 24-month fuel cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Approximately 6 months after startup from RFO 8/9, IP3 began an extended unplanned nonrefueling outage. In November and December of 1994, RHR containment isolation valves AC&hyph;732, AC&hyph;741, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;743, AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;744, and AC&hyph;MOV&hyph;1870 are due for their Type C LLRT. Currently, the interval for Type C testing of these valves is 30 months. Therefore, the licensee requested a one-time schedular exemption to allow Type C LLRTs of the above listed valves to be deferred until the 9/10 RFO, which is currently scheduled for the spring of 1996. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> By letter dated November 2, 1994, the licensee requested withdrawal of the proposed changes to the TSs and modified the exemption request. Specifically, the licensee requested that the exemption extend until the return to power following the current outage, which is defined as prior to T <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> avg <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  exceeding 350 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir; F. The NRC staff granted the request for withdrawal of the proposed changes to the TSs in a letter dated November 3, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to 10 CFR 50.12, the Commission may, upon application by any interested person or upon its own initiative, grant exemptions from the requirements of 10 CFR part 50 when (1) the exemptions are authorized by law, will not present an undue risk to public health and safety, and are consistent with the common defense and security and (2) when special circumstances are present. According to 10 CFR 50.12(a)(2)(ii), special circumstances are present whenever application of the regulation in the particular circumstances is not necessary to achieve the underlying purpose of the rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The CFR at 10 CFR part 50, Appendix J, Paragraphs III.D.3, states: ``Type C tests shall be performed during each reactor shutdown for refueling but in no case at intervals greater than 2 years *&blank;*&blank;*.'' The underlying purpose of the requirement to perform Type C containment leak rate tests at intervals not to exceed 2 years is to ensure that any potential leakage pathways through the containment boundary are identified within a time span that prevents significant degradation from continuing or being unknown, and long enough to allow the test to be conducted during scheduled refueling outages. The requirements to perform Type C LLRTs at intervals no greater than 2 years presumed the 2-year time interval was adequate to accommodate the 12-month fuel cycles which were common when Appendix J to 10 CFR part 50 was published in 1973. However, IP3, along with several other facilities, are utilizing core designs which allow operation on a 24-month cycle. In January 12, 1993, the NRC staff issued an exemption that allowed Types B and C LLRTs to be performed at intervals up to 30 months, thus, permitting operation on a 24-month fuel cycle. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

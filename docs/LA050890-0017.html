			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> VENTURA ISSUE WHAT'S BEST FOR THE PIER?  </P> <P> The city of Ventura is planning to take over the 118-year-old Ventura Pier from  the state and restore it to its original length. To offset the $140,000 annual  cost of  </P> <P> maintenance, it expects to add some revenue-generating concessions. Some people  say further development of the pier with these commercial enterprises makes  </P> <P> good financial sense. Others have concerns that the pier could lose its  historical appeal and take on a carnival-like flavor.  </P> <P> Russ Smith  </P> <P> Executive director, Ventura Visitors and Convention Bureau  </P> <P>  "The logical way I would look at it as a taxpayer and as if I were in city  government would be to develop enough revenue-generating sources not on the  pier itself, but over the sand adjacent to the  </P> <P> pier. The profits from retail stores, restaurants, etc., would establish a  revolving fund, if you will, for the annual maintenance which is so important  for that pier. If you don't maintain it each year, gradually it gets worse and  worse. Then you have a storm, and you're in the dire straits it's in now. City  governments are increasingly facing a shortfall of funding, and you can't  maintain present levels of existing services if you're not at the same time  generating funds to augment taxpayer dollars. The pier is traditional with  Ventura, it's important to Ventura for its residents and its visitors, so we  should do what we can to make sure it's usable."  </P> <P> Russ Baggerly  </P> <P> Board member, Environmental Coalition of Ventura County  </P> <P>  "The restoration is a very important opportunity to bring the beach back to  our city. Planning should be done with the community in mind, not with the idea  of bringing in people from Santa Monica or  </P> <P> San Francisco. The business uses of the pier should be planned with the people  and the history of Ventura in mind. The pier has a long history. The city  should insist on an element in the contract for restoration that a public  historian should conduct research into the historical uses of the pier and at  the base of the pier. An interpretive element could be incorporated into the  best commercial uses identified from the historical information. This should  not, however, turn out to be a theme park, but an honest attempt to bring back  the flavor of Ventura for Venturans before the freeway cut us in half."  </P> <P> Red Maurer  </P> <P> Fisherman  </P> <P>  "The fishermen would sure like to see the pier restored, and so would I. If we  had a longer pier, it would be a lot better. There's more fish out there at the  end of the pier. You get better-size fish out there.  </P> <P> In the summer you get mackerel, and all kinds of other good fish, halibut and  sea bass out at the end of the pier. Restaurants and concessions won't bother  us at all. It won't hurt us a bit. No way. Even the bait shop down there says  they will get more business if there are more doings down at the pier. Lots of  people like to walk on the pier, just to see the ocean. It's a tourist trap  right now. There is not enough room for all the fishermen at the pier now. It's  too packed. Sometimes you can't find room for your pole. I've seen the pier  repaired about five times over the years. I've seen waves go clear over the  top."  </P> <P> Ed Robings  </P> <P> Executive director, Ventura County Museum of History and Art  </P> <P>  "The pier is important to the city's economy. It's also important  historically. We're part of the hospitality industry in Ventura County. We have  many tour groups that come to the museum. I feel  </P> <P> that we need more tourist attractions and more things to entertain those people  who visit our beaches and visit Ventura County. The best thing about tourists  is they bring money with them and leave it behind when they go. It's important  to stress that improved facilities and amenities at the pier would not only be  used by out-of-towners and tourists, but also by local residents. Restoration  and improvement of the pier is an important thing to do. I don't think of the  pier the same way I do a very old house or the Ventura City Hall. I think of  the pier as being in the ocean and subject to dramatic storms we have."  </P> <P> Grant Phillips  </P> <P> Chairman of the steering committee for Alliance for Ventura's Future  </P> <P> "When I was a youngster, my dad and I went down to the pier frequently for  fishing. It's a place to get away from the hustle and bustle, find some peace  and quiet. It's a good place for families to have  </P> <P> outings. I do have some concerns about the type of development they want to put  on the pier. I would want to see the amount of development limited so it  doesn't end up dominating the pier. This is something that has not been spelled  out, exactly what they intend to do. I would think things oriented toward  supplying fish bait, fishing supplies, a restaurant, things of this nature, are  very compatible. I would not want to see it become a carnival-type thing. I  don't think that's the direction most people want it to go. I do have some  reservations about the city taking over the ownership just by nature of the  cost of the maintenance."  </P></p>

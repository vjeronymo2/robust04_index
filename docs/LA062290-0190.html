			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOS ALAMITOS;  </P> <P> DASH FOR CASH TOPS AFTERNOON RACING CARD  </P> <P> Los Alamitos hosts the first of five afternoon racing programs Sunday with a  13-race card highlighted by the $110,000 Dash For Cash Derby.  </P> <P> Los Al's first afternoon racing program in more than 15 years is dubbed Family  Day.  </P> <P> Children accompanied by an adult will participate in drawings for tickets to  Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm. An outdoor barbecue will be served  accompanied by a strolling Dixieland band. The first 4,000 full-paid admissions  on Sunday receive a free wagering voucher valued between $1 and $100.  </P> <P> The Grade I Dash For Cash Derby goes as the 11th race on Sunday's program,  which gets under way at 1:45 p.m. with the track's gates opening at noon. The  10 finalists in the Derby earned a starting position by stepping off the  fastest times in two time trials June 13 at Los Al.  </P> <P> Here's how they'll line up for the 11th running of the 440-yard Dash For Cash  Derby (from the rail out with riding assignments): Mighty Easy Pass (Juan  Limon, 117), Starlets Secret (Bruce Pilkenton, 117), Life Line (Ralph Seville,  122), Newmont (Jesse Godinez, 122), Rebel Dasher (Eddie Garcia, 122),  Ourautograph (Kip Didericksen, 122), Dashin Dee Dee (Danny Cardoza, 117),  Chasearacer (Steve Treasure, 122), BCR A Blurr ForSure (Roman Figueroa, 117)  and Teller Cash (James Lackey, 117).  </P> <P> Ourautograph is pegged as the 8-5 morning-line favorite to capture the Dash For  Cash Derby. After distinguishing himself among the nation's juveniles last  year, Ourautograph underwent knee surgery late last year and has returned to  the track in top form. The gelding raced wire-to-wire in the Laddie Handicap in  his first start of the year for trainer Bob Baffert and then came back to miss  by a nose in trials for the Dash For Cash Derby two weeks ago.  </P></p>

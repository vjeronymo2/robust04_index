			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bundesbank allows flicker of hope - The Bath meeting may mark beginning of the end of Europe's high interest rates WITH any luck, the meeting last weekend of European Community finance ministers in Bath will mark the beginning of the end of the present protracted period of high interest rates in Europe. Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, who chaired the meeting, altered the nature of interest rate expectations on financial markets by obtaining the Bundesbank's assent to a statement that it 'in present circumstances has no intention to increase rates'. Fears of an increase in the internationally important German Lombard rate from its current 9.75 per cent level have preyed on financial markets ever since the Bundesbank increased its discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 8.75 per cent in mid-July. By putting on record its intention not to increase rates, the Bundesbank should ensure that expectations of future German rate movements in Europe will be downwards. Big question marks still hang over the timing of a relaxation in German monetary policy. And the Bundesbank pledge does not exclude the possibility of other nations having to raise rates in the event of external shocks such as a further downwards spiral of the dollar or a French No vote in the country's September 20 referendum on the Maastricht treaty. But the UK chancellor, underlining it was 'the first time' the Bundesbank had committed itself 'openly and publicly' not to raise rates, said he regarded the promise as 'a significant outcome' of the talks. Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said he detected 'a new spirit' in the talks. 'The outlook is for lower interest rates. The Bundesbank is no longer in a frame of mind to raise rates,' he said. It was an unexpected result won only after some tough talking. The Bath meeting, which opened under the cloud of serious dollar weakness and renewed strains in the European exchange rate mechanism last Friday, was supposed to give the 12 finance ministers and central bank governors a chance to discuss such issues as the future work of the EC economic and finance ministers' council; the state of negotiations in the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, and monetary relations between non-ERM countries and the EC member states in the run-up to European economic and monetary union. These agenda items were scrapped and the talks, which overran their planned duration by more than an hour, concentrated on the state of the European economy and the strains in the ERM. Instead, Germany came under 'colossal pressure' to cut interest rates, according to Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish economy minister. The pressure from the 11 countries was 'far more than I've ever experienced,' he said. The plan for Germany's EC partners to mount a strong campaign to persuade Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, of the need for lower European interest rates at a time of economic slowdown in Europe was hatched by Mr Lamont and UK officials after an informal dinner for the ministers on Friday night. Huddled before an open fire in a secluded back room of Bath's Royal Crescent Hotel, the UK delegation decided to seek the support of France, Spain, Italy, Ireland and Denmark for concerted pressure on Germany. Little wonder Mr Waigel looked uncomfortable on Saturday as he protested he was not going to be 'put in the dock' over Germany's interest rate policy. As usual, Mr Waigel put up a spirited defence. of Germany's position. People should remember how they profited from the boom after German unification, he said. Criticism of Germany's fiscal policy was unwarranted. His budget proposals for 1993 would be the most stringent of any in the EC, he promised. After the meeting there was disappointment Germany had not promised to lower interest rates. But such a pledge was never in the realm of realistic expectation. Setting interest rate policy is the prerogative of the independent Bundesbank's decision-making central council, in which Mr Schlesinger sits only as a primus inter pares. He therefore anticipates its decisions at his peril. The Bundesbank president was able to indicate that German interest rates had peaked because that was one of the conclusions the council reached last Thursday in its regular fortnightly meeting. Although Mr Lamont's statement, which said the Bundesbank would be 'watching closely the further development of the economy' appeared to suggest the German central bank could be poised to cut rates in the event of a serious economic downturn in Germany, Mr Schlesinger was predictably guarded about the interest rate outlook. He insisted that there was no scope for a reduction in German short-term interest rates as long as Germany's money supply continued to grow at its current rapid pace and there was no clear easing in inflationary tensions. But his willingness to agree to the 'no increase' statement marked something of a change of heart at the top of the Bundesbank. Before the July discount rate increase senior Bundesbank officials were complaining that the bank had missed an opportunity to clamp down hard on inflation by not lifting the Lombard rate above 10 per cent during the previous winter. While Mr Schlesinger appeared to stifle hopes of an early German interest rate cut, Mr Waigel was more receptive to the idea. Referring to his budget plans and the need for Germany's wage negotiators to keep pay increases down, the minister said: 'We will do what we can. . . to achieve scope for reducing interest rates as soon as possible.' Although Mr Waigel put on a show of public solidarity with the Bundesbank president at a press conference after the talks, some of his officials gave the impression that the Bonn finance ministry sympathised with other EC countries in wanting German rates to fall sooner rather than later. However, as Mr Lamont pointed out, Mr Waigel has his share of responsibility for Germany's high rates. The policy mix in Germany was 'a matter of some concern and some discussion', Mr Lamont said. Specifically, the chancellor is worried large-scale granting of subsidised credits to eastern Germany is boosting German money supply growth and helping to perpetuate high interest rates. Despite Mr Waigel's protestations of fiscal rectitude, Mr Lamont and other EC finance ministers are also concerned that the government can increase its borrowings through state organisations such as the Treuhand and the German post office without such fund-raising counting as part of the German public sector borrowing requirement. While the Bath meeting offered some hope of lower interest rates, there are many hurdles before that prospect becomes reality. In the meantime, Mr Waigel can expect to find himself 'in the dock' at international meetings. Economic Indicators, Page 6 UK officials hatched a plan as they huddled before an open fire</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HARBOR WINS FIFTH CONSECUTIVE SCAC TITLE WITH 10-2 VICTORY  </P> <P> It was business as usual for Los Angeles Harbor baseball Coach Jim O'Brien on  Thursday.  </P> <P> O'Brien watched L.A. Harbor defeat Mission College, 10-2, and clinch its fifth  consecutive Southern California Athletic Conference championship.  </P> <P> O'Brien has won 11 conference championships in 15 seasons at the school. L.A.  Harbor is 37-5 and 16-0 in the conference. Mission is 22-10-1 and 12-5. Mission  remains in second place in the conference.  </P> <P> "We're just coming along right on schedule," O'Brien said. "This is a very  determined group."  </P> <P> The Seahawks combined strong pitching with potent hitting to remain undefeated  at home this season. Starting pitcher Pat Ahearne allowed only two runs and  three hits in seven innings to improve to 9-1. The sophomore right-hander from  St. Bernard High tied a school record of 20 victories in a career set by Rod  Van Lue in the 1976-77 seasons. John Rodriguez and John Matich combined for two  innings of perfect relief.  </P> <P> L.A. Harbor had 14 hits, including eight doubles, a triple, and a pair of home  runs, both from first baseman Ryan Karp. Shortstop Tony Liebsack had two  doubles and left fielder George Baker had a double and a triple.  </P> <P> Karp, a sophomore, hit a two-run homer in the fourth and a solo homer in the  sixth. He has four homers.  </P> <P> Mission used three pitchers, but L.A. Harbor did most of its damage against  starter Nino Romo (5-2), who surrendered four doubles and a home run in the  fourth inning to give the Seahawks a 4-0 lead. Romo, who didn't give up a hit  in the first three innings, left the game in the sixth with Mission trailing,  7-0.  </P> <P> "This is a good team we played today," said Mission Coach John Klitsner, a  former Sylmar High coach. "And when you have any kind of breakdown against them  you're going to pay for it."  </P> <P> Mission first baseman Eddie Chavez hit a two-run homer in the seventh.  </P></p>

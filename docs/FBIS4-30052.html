			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 23 (YONHAP) -- Trade, Industry and  Energy Minister Kim Chol-su said Thursday he feels a strong  sense of responsibility to run for the post of secretary-general  of the World Trade Organization (WTO).    "It's a great honor that the Korean Government has  recommended me as a candidate for the position, but at the same  time I feel a heavy responsibility to compete for the post at  the world organization which is called the United Nations of the  economy," Kim said in an interview.    He explained that the new WTO secretary-general is entitled  to officially launch the trade body next Jan. 1 or at the  earliest possible date thereafter.    The new secretary-general, he continued, should also push  for  negotiations on the service sector that are still pending after  the Uruguay Round.    In addition, the group's chief must exercise leadership in  solving the myriad world trade problems linked to the  environment, economic policies, labor standards and technology  policies, he noted.</p>

He further announced the posting of a Kenyan ambassador  to Israel will be done in the next few months. The president  made the announcement while addressing a session of the Israeli  parliament this afternoon in Jerusalem.    President Moi said that parliamentary democracy remains the  only form of government in which the two ideals of a democratic  society are protected. The president added that although there  are some fundamental principles in any society such as the right  to freedom, justice, property and protection of life, every  society has its own specific homegrown characteristics and  principles. He explained that it was in a mixture of these  principles that a true democratic society could evolve.    Describing the Israeli parliamentary institution as one of  the most well developed in the world, the president said those  Kenyan members of parliament with him will no doubt learn from  the Israeli practice of parliamentary democracy. President Moi  said that Kenya had benefited immensely from the business  activities of the Jewish people and companies, particularly in  civil engineering and trade. He hoped his visit will consolidate  those ties for the benefit of the peoples of the two countries.    And on the situation in this region, President Moi told the  Israeli parliamentarians that today Kenya hosts the seventh  largest refugee population in the world mainly from Somalia. He  added that apart from being a strain on Kenya's limited  resources there was also serious insecurity in many parts of the  country as some of the refugees carry with them sophisticated  weapons as they flee their country into Kenya.    The Israeli prime minister, Yitzhaq Rabin, said in a speech  read on his behalf by the Israeli minister for foreign affairs,  Mr. Shim'on Peres, that Kenya and Israel shared a common history  of struggle to liberate their peoples from oppression. Mr.  Rabin praised Kenya for the role it had played in support of  Israel in many issues that are of interest to the country. The  Knesset session was also addressed by the leader of the  opposition in parliament who is also the chairman of the Likud  party Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu. [passage omitted]    Other reports say that President Moi this evening held  discussions with the leader of the opposition in Israel, Mr.  Benjamin Netanyahu, at the King David Hotel. And later  President Moi hosted a colorful reception at the same hotel that  was attended by President Ezer Weizman of Israel, senior  government officials, the leader of the opposition and members  of the diplomatic corps.

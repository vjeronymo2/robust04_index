			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Lukashev report in the "Tataria" column: "Repeat </F> Elections Will Be Held in March If a Treaty Between Tataria and  Russia Is Signed"]    [Text] The Russian Central Election Commission has ruled  that repeat elections in Tataria will be held on 13 March.    The republic's citizens are to elect deputies to the State  Duma in five single-seat constituencies and to the Federation  Council in a two-seat constituency. Under the current election  statute, the candidates are to raise the requisite number of  signatures for registration again.    Local observers believe that this time the republic's  leadership has no reason to block the elections: After 12  December, when 12.9 percent of the electorate turned out at the  polling stations, the local authorities had grounds to say that  "the people are with us, not with Moscow." It is even accepted  that someone from among the supreme leadership in the republic  may want to run for the Federation Council, possibly President  Shaymiyev himself.    Furthermore, it is not ruled that the ongoing reformation of  the representative and executive bodies in Tataria will end with  the calling of elections to the local National Assembly, also on  13 March. This option is being discussed in the lobbies of the  republic's Supreme Soviet and it will possibly be submitted to  the deputies at the Supreme Soviet session scheduled for the  second half of January.    As for Mintimer Shaymiyev himself, he attended the  Federation  Council session on its first day as an observer. In an  interview with SEGODNYA the Tatarstan president said that the  repeat elections will be held in the republic provided the  treaty between Russia and Tataria is signed before 13 March.  "Otherwise the people of Tatarstan will simply have no reason  to go to the polls," Mr. Shaymiyev said.</p>

			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / Recruitment: Redundancy reigns in Metroland - Ageist policies and the wasted talents of a generation of executives The unemployed have become stuck with the stereotypical image of the out-of-work northern man. He is either a miner or a docker, wears big boots, a thick brown belt, corduroy trousers and a vest, and thumps the table every time he makes a point. He is as much a part of history as the Jarrow march, yet his image continues to prevail, reinforced by persistent 'death of a community' newspaper reports on the demise of the coal industry. It seems that not until the last lump of coal has been hewn or the last rivet punched into the last ship's hull will the caricature be laid to rest. George Orwell's legacy has been a long time fading, but even though areas of social deprivation still exist, the picture largely belongs to another time. Today the road of social hardship no longer leads to Wigan Pier, but to Swindon, High Wycombe and Welwyn Garden City. The semi-detached home counties suburbia immortalised by John Betjeman in his poems of Metroland has become the focus of 1990s unemployment. Beyond the poplar-lined avenues and mock-Tudor facades and the neatly manicured lawns of open-plan executive housing estates resides a groundswell of resentment. The extent of the anger in these Tory heartlands is crystallised in a sheaf of letters that appeared on my desk this week. The letters were sent to an Oxford-based recruitment magazine in response to its campaign on ageism in the workplace. Almost all were from people in the 40-55 age bracket with many years of experience in their chosen fields. Typically they had a job in middle management paying a good salary, say between Pounds 30,000 to Pounds 40,000, with commitments and a life-style to match. Suddenly they found themselves redundant; too old and too expensive for their organisations' needs. All the letters make well-written, cogent points. One is from a woman, aged over 45, an experienced export sales and marketing manager, fluent in three European languages and caught, as she says, 'in the continuing middle-management pruning'. 'How is it possible that the thousands of currently unemployed executives and managers can be treated in such a manner?' she asks. She belongs to a privately organised executive jobs club in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. It has 120 members, mostly aged over 45. 'The amount of experience, talent and management ability being wasted is absolutely incredible,' she says. She adds: 'Please do not think we do not try; that we do not send out hundreds of finely honed CVs; that we do not know about networking, cold-letters, agencies and all the other methods employed by those out of work.' Job applications, she says, often get no replies or a tactful note indicating that her date of birth is a problem. 'For the first time in my life, I have been forced to become conscious of my age. What employers do not seem to comprehend is that someone who is 45 plus is often more stable, secure, able to take decisions, willing to start early and work late, does not take Mondays off or have small families to cope with, unlike many 25 to 35-year-olds. So why is industry so blinkered?' Another writer who, he says, has committed 'the cardinal sin of getting old', recalls an interview session where on more than one occasion the interviewer used the expression 'getting on a bit'. He and fellow job seekers have become so accustomed to rejection letters that they now 'hold a lottery as to what excuse will be in the standard three paragraphs'. A 47-year-old High Wycombe man, made redundant after a company takeover five years ago, says he has never signed on for unemployment benefit and, after a series of part-time and temporary jobs has become 'resigned to never having a 'proper job' again'. It must be stressed that these are not unqualified people. One of the letters begins: 'I am a chartered accountant, 55 years of age, with an impressive track record of success and achievement in both private and public limited companies as finance director and company secretary.' Since becoming unemployed last March, for the third time and through no fault of his own, he insists, he has written 'countless letters of application without success, in many cases not getting even the courtesy of an acknowledgement'. He also registered with a number of specialist recruitment agencies, but was subsequently told by a company recruiter that 'virtually every recruitment agency will just push to one side any job application and speculative CV if the age of the applicant is 50 or more', unless the job calls for such a person. The accountant writes: 'I truly believe that the majority of agencies and employers think that the over 50s are in wheelchairs or on sticks, are totally bald and toothless, and are too weak and frail even to lift a pen or a key into a computer.' He ends: 'I see little hope of John Major or any of his minions doing anything that will help the mature job seeker. He has most certainly lost my vote - for good.' A letter from an engineer says he 'worked very hard through engineering apprenticeship, engineering studentship and university to achieve Master of Science and Chartered Engineer status and for the last two years I have been jobless like many other people in my situation. I could have pretended I am a self-employed consultant like many professionals do to hide the shame of being unemployed.' Behind many of these letters are cases of real hardship. A 50-year-old man from Bath explains how he was made redundant in 1990 from a job that paid more then Pounds 40,000 a year. His house was repossessed by the building society and sold for less than his mortgage. He has four children and has moved house four times in three years. He has experienced, he says, 'a total inability to find a job paying any salary at all', yet has claimed no assistance from the state 'due to desperate efforts to generate an income by any self-employed means'. He has, he says, sold insurance and encyclopaedias, driven a taxi, written stories, worked as a holding manager in a problem public house, designed promotional schemes for the catering trade, carried out sales training for small businesses and done gardening work. His is a pessimistic note. 'The discrimination is not going to stop or even diminish' because society has fundamentally changed, he argues. Among the changes, he says 'the corporate bodies we once gave our lives to working for no longer have a social conscience, if indeed they ever had one'. How is this man coping? He says: 'I survive. I look forward, not back. I create a new, completely different lifestyle. I rely on my family and a few close friends. I use all my energies chasing opportunities to make money (not as much as before), rather than trying to find a job, although I still do that as well.' These letters reveal the hidden unemployment among the middle classes. They reflect real despair among good, qualified, able, experienced people who feel as if they have been dumped on the scrap-heap through, as one of them put it, no fault of their own. All feel victims of age discrimination. Perhaps this trend is a phenomenon of the 1990s, a combination of recession and the revolution in working practices. Perhaps the pay expectations of the managerial classes have outgrown demand. Whatever the case, these stories reflect an unacceptable waste of talent, experience and enthusiasm. Usually this column is devoted to ideas and trends in the recruitment market, writing about how jobs are changing, different forms of work, outplacement, pay, share options, boardroom compositions, a mixture of the concrete and theory. Sometimes, however, before you can consider solutions it helps to be aware of the problem.</p>

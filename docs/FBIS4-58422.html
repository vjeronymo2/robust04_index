			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres at the signing </F> ceremony of the Israeli-Palestinian Self-Rule Agreement at the  International Convention Center in Cairo -- live, in English]    [Text] Ladies and gentlemen: Nowadays you can watch how  birth is being given on the television. Now you have had the  occasion to watch it. What really happened is that we finished  our negotiations by 0230 in the morning, and apparently we were  short of five minutes. We apologize for taking these five  minutes from you. [applause]    We had a dream before we had a map. Now we have a map and a  dream together. Thank you. [applause]    Your Excellency, the President of Egypt Husni Mubarak  [applause]: Happy birthday! Blessed may be your way from being  a pilot in the defense of your country and becoming a captain in  the peace of the region; [applause]    Prime Minister Rabin, that his people appreciate a decision  and a leadership in a very difficult time;    Foreign Secretary of State Warren Christopher, thank you for  your tireless support; [applause]    Foreign Minister Kozyrev, thank you for the positive  assistance; [applause]    Foreign Minister Godal of Norway, thank you for being a  Norwegian; [applause]    My dear friend, 'Amr Musa [applause], whose smiles and  wisdom helped so much to overcome the hurdles of the  negotiations, thank you very much; [applause]    Chairman 'Arafat, our partner in a very difficult journey:  We did it! [applause]    Your Excellencies, distinguished guests, ladies and  gentlemen, the reason for the conflict in the Middle East was  the unhappy encounter between the Jewish and the Arab  renaissance at the same time, at the same place. Thus, for  almost half a century, we experienced blood and hatred, terror  and war. Today we declare that the conflict is over. [applause]    Today we have agreed to promise mothers and children, Arabs  and Jewish, that no finger will pull a trigger or endanger the  lives or to affect the dignity or happiness of their children.    Less than a year has passed since the night in Oslo where  Israelis and Palestinians gathered secretly to initial a  dramatic turning point in the history of their peoples. What  seems in the eyes of many to be utopian becomes today a reality.  I recall the strenuous days and endless nights needed to cross  the valleys of mistrust and suspicion. And, again, we did it!    We refer to a dual commitment: the moral history of our  nation and the need of the people in the region. Our position  stems from a moral code: Govern yourself; don't rule others.    So, the agreement today is not a submission to the threats  of  weapons; it is in reality a return to the values of our heritage.    We do not want to be the governors, the judges, or the  police  of the Palestinian people. It is for the Palestinians to elect  their leaders, nominate their judges, appoint their policemen.  All we wish is to become their friendly neighbors. [applause]  All we hope is to see them as our good neighbors. Today we  welcome you, the Palestinian people, as neighbors. [applause]    We must look ahead. We state earnestly to the Arab people,  that you and us, we need a Middle East, a geography of peace, a  territory of prosperity, a community based on market economy,  responsible diplomacy, and a land that will regain its  fertility. We assure that we shall not stop here; that we shall  reach peace with Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and make it  comprehensive and durable. [applause]    We shall continue to negotiate with the Palestinians for a  permanent solution. Relations are more telling than borders. We  are mapping today our relations, so that we shall be able to map  borders in the future. With the exception of war, the greatest  menace is the poverty. Nobody should pay for follies and  belligerencies. We can put to the right use our available  resources, the water we possess, the land we own, the knowledge  we acquire for the benefit of our people -- a Middle East for  the people and by the people.    The story of modern society is not a national separation but  an economic cooperation. No nation can dominate, and yet every  nation must compete and ably so. We know already that computers  are mightier than guns. We know that the new opportunities  reside in the campuses of the scientists rather than in the  camps of the armies.    Ladies and gentlemen, the future is inevitable, just as  peace  is inevitable, and for all of us. A year ago, a meeting like  that of today would have been perceived as unreal. Yet today it  is a reality. Alongside the magic river that held the cradle of  Moses, at the foot of the pyramids that withstood the test of  time, to see such a distinguished and unique gathering like you  and us here today carries a new promise.    The president of Egypt; the foreign ministers of the  cosponsors, the United States and the Russian Republic; as well  as the foreign minister of Norway; respected delegates of Arab  countries and Europe; sponsors and donors from all continents:  We thank you for the sense of a fresh beginning, for a new  image and a new era for the people of our region.    Much work still lies before us. Many are the enemies and  many are the obstacles on the road of peace. Yet, if we do all  we must, we can make this concrete beginning into a brilliant  future. And then, when looking upon the horizon, we shall know  that the reddish lining is not of blood but of a rising dawn.    In the words of prophet Isaiah: In place of brass I will  bring gold, in place of iron I will bring silver. Violence  shall no more be heard in your land, nor war, nor destruction  within your borders. [applause]    Long live peace to all of us! Thank you. [applause]</p>

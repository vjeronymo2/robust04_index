			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Alliance Deputy Giuseppe Tatarella </F> by Paola Motta; place and date not given: "I Am Not the Devil"  -- first paragraph is L'INFORMAZIONE introduction]    [Text] Rome -- People are talking of him, a former MSI  [Italian Social Movement] politician, as the first deputy prime  minister. But he, Giuseppe Tatarella, is saying that he would  prefer to remain in his job of lower house floor leader.  [National Alliance Secretary] Fini, however, apparently does  not agree. The two met yesterday afternoon. Tatarella admitted  only that the decision "is coming about calmly." Adding  ironically: "Who has the greater say in the matter, a secretary  or a simple party member? The secretary, of course...."    [Motta] In short, you are not really enthusiastic about  being  deputy prime minister.    [Tatarella] The problem is that I have greatly enjoyed being  the floor leader during a period in which people changed from  discrimination against us to dialogue. According to Fini, I  would be able to do something different inside the government  and he maintains that this position offers an opportunity for  better dialogue.    [Motta] Is it true that it is you who untied the knot on the  question of the parliamentary houses by proposing [Senate  speaker] Scognamiglio?    [Tatarella] Yes, it is true. We had to put together a short  list. Everyone was silent, and I made this proposal. My  reasoning was this: In Italy Scognamiglio represents liberal  democratic thinking, lay thinking, while Pivetti [Chamber of  Deputies speaker] represents the Catholic faction; two groups  which are complementary in Italy's history.    [Motta] All sorts of assumptions are being made as to the  list of possible ministers. For the National Alliance, the  names which keep on appearing are Fisichella, Fiori, Tremaglia.  Do they have a chance?    [Tatarella] The chance exists. I would be happy if  Fisichella were to get a ministry. I believe that it is right  and high time to ask for a minister of emigration, in particular  following the very tormented ride that we had with votes for  Italians abroad. Tremaglia's name appears appropriate to me  because one immediately thinks of him when considering the issue  of votes for Italians abroad and vice versa.    [Motta] Do you believe that Article 92 of the Constitution,  which places the choice of ministers at the discretion of the  prime minister, will be applied this time?    [Tatarella] Yes, the choice should lie solely with the prime  minister, and hence with Berlusconi. I think that someone as  intuitive as he is will certainly have understood that a  government cannot be formed just from one party and that this is  a key demand expressed by citizens.    [Motta] Whom would you like to see as interior minister?    [Tatarella] People are talking of [anti-Mafia Judge] Di  Pietro and this suggestion makes me particularly happy. But  they say that the judge is unwilling to accept. Di Pietro, who  has been one of the "founding fathers" of this new stage in the  country's history, ought to understand this not so much an  opportunity to be the minister of this or that, but an  invitation to take part directly in the building of the Second  Republic. If I were Di Pietro and I were asked, I would reply:  For the sake of the news media I would say no, for the sake of  history I would say yes.    [Motta] What do you think about the polemics which have  burst  out about 25 April [Liberation Day].    [Tatarella] I do not support the instrumentalist thesis, as  this has already been put forward by individuals who are not  from the Right, and who are therefore more credible, in terms of  objectivity, than I am. From my side, I would have betted high  and organized a debate between De Felice, Bobbio, and Foa for an  analysis of the Right-Left alternation as it features in this  country's history. Today the problem is historical and the  debate must be led by those who historically have something to  say.    [Motta] What do you say to those who fear the presence of  former MSI people in the government?    [Tatarella] They ought to reflect on our behavior. Our  secretary is asking nothing for himself, and the floor leader  would like to remain the floor leader. We are a party which,  even if invited, has not put forward candidates for the  parliamentary speaker positions, or for the Interior or Foreign  Ministries. A party which, in short, has proven its ability to  choose the line of cohabitation and compatibility, not creating  problems for anyone. This line is the best possible guarantee.    [Motta] Their fears are therefore unfounded.    [Tatarella] Fears are of two types only: those of people who  have an interest in these fears existing, and objective fears.  To the first I will reply nothing because, even if I were to  become Pope Innocent III, they would still say that I was the  devil. With regard to the founded fears I say: If we make a  mess of things, our credibility ends, and they will have every  right to ask us to step aside. If, on the other hand, we do not  make mistakes, it is their duty to admit publicly that their  fear has been unwarranted.    [Motta] If you remain the National Alliance's floor leader,  what will you do?    [Tatarella] My battle will be to convince the progressives  that the majority-opposition concept no longer exists in the  majority system and in the system of having one side or the  other in government. Opposition is control, one force governs,  the other controls. And those who control can become the  controlled.    [Motta] Will the Left be in a position to control?    [Tatarella] With all the spectacle of divisions which they  are giving, I think that they will not succeed all that easily.  On the other hand, the history of the Left in Italy is that of  splits. The concept of government was born with the Right,  which was the first to govern. When the Left came to govern  under Depretis [19th century], transformism was born. The Left  was born of transformism and splits, this is the truth. It is  its hidden weakness.</p>

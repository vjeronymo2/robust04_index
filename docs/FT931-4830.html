			<p>930309 FT  09 MAR 93 / International Company News: Canadian Pacific arm in CDollars 160m equity issue CANADIAN PACIFIC's Forest Products arm, CPFP, is planning to raise CDollars 160m (USDollars 128m) of new equity in order to bolster working capital and to support the remaining portion of its heavy investment programme. However, Canadian Pacific is not taking up any of the 8m common shares, which are being sold at CDollars 20 a share to an investment group headed by Scotia McLeod. Its total interest in CPFP will drop from 70 per cent to 60.7 per cent. The Forest Products arm raised USDollars 75m in a debenture issue in January and last raised new equity in 1992 with an issue at CDollars 26.50 a share. CP took up 20 per cent. CPFP, one of North America's biggest newsprint producers, has omitted its common share dividend to conserve cash. It suffered a loss for 1992 of CDollars 248m, or CDollars 4.82 a share, on sales of Dollars 1.8bn, after restructuring charges. SNC, Canada's biggest engineering group, benefited from rationalisation and growing international business, which are helping to offset the long domestic recession. Fourth-quarter net profit was CDollars 6.5m, or 45 cents a share, against a loss of CDollars 1.9m, or 17 cents, a year earlier on revenues ahead at CDollars 255m, against CDollars 211m.</p>

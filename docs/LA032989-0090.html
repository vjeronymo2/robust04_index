			<p><P> March 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : AMERICAN JAZZ SOCIETIES TO MEET IN CULVER CITY; CRESCENT CITY TO  HOST NEW ORLEANS FESTIVAL  </P> <P> "Jazz: One Music" is the theme of the fourth annual American Federation of Jazz  Societies convention, to be held Friday through Sunday at the Pacifica Hotel in  Culver City. About 200 delegates from 115 affiliated jazz societies in the  United States and Canada -- in addition to a scattering of musicians and jazz  aficionados -- are expected to attend the three-day event, which includes panel  discussions, workshops, music presentations, photo and art exhibitions and  screening of archival film footage.  </P> <P> The convention's theme is also the underlying concept of the federation, which  was formed in 1984. "There's always been a schism between jazz fans, like  modernists and traditionalists, and this organization was formed, and this  theme was chosen, in an effort to bring (these factions) together," said Floyd  Levin, who founded the Southern California Hot Jazz Society, the second oldest  society in the United States, in 1949. (The first, the New Orleans Jazz  Society, was founded in 1948.)  </P> <P> The prime purpose of the convention is "to perpetuate jazz and retain a grasp  of the historical elements that make our music so important," said Levin, who  has written on jazz for such publications as Jazz Journal, Jazz Forum,  Metronome, down beat and Coda.  </P> <P> The panel discussions and workshops, whose topics range from "The Making of  'Bird' " to "Raising Money for Jazz," are basically open only to convention  delegates, says Levin, "though if someone is interested in attending a program  on a seat-availability basis, there would be no problem," nor a charge. The  public may pay a $75 convention registration fee, which includes tickets for  all events, plus four meals, Levin added.  </P> <P> Separate tickets are available for the musical presentations -- by such jazz  players as clarinetist Abe Most's quintet, altoist Charles McPherson's quartet  and the Jazzin' Babies Jazz Band -- and for "Jazz From Harlem to Hollywood," an  evening of jazz films from the library of Mark Cantor. The concerts are priced  at $10, the films at $5. Information: (213) 654-1610.  </P> <P> FESTIVAL CELEBRATES ITS 20TH YEAR IN NEW ORLEANS: Tickets are now on sale for  the 20th Annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, to be held in several  venues in Crescent City, April 28-May 7. Such artists as Miles Davis, Wynton  Marsalis, the Neville Brothers, Al Green, Dr. John, Etta James, Art Blakey and  Pete Fountain are among the hundreds of jazz, blues, R&amp;B, pop and New  Orleans-based performers scheduled to appear. For a complete lineup, call (504)  568-0251.  </P> <P> **** James Williams' "Magical Trio 2" (EmArcy) finds the youthful pianist  plying his formidable wares in the company of two aces -- drummer Elvin Jones  and bassist Ray Brown. Williams, who bears a strong McCoy Tyner influence,  smokes two burning versions of "Bohemia After Dark," offers a nice modern  shuffle on his own "Road Life" and exhibits a powerful blues presence on  "Lullabye of the Leaves." His partners never falter.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Geneva, 18 Jan (TANJUG) -- This year's first  round of peace negotiations began in Geneva's Palace of Nations  shortly before 1300 today. Lord Owen and [Thorvald] Stoltenberg  invited the presidents of Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia as  well as the leaders of the three warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina to find ways of communicating and eventually  to sign a peace agreement.    Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said on arrival at  Geneva Airport that "the Serbian side has fulfilled its share of  obligations" and that "now it is the Muslim side and the  international community which should fulfill their share of  obligations regarding the adoption of a peace plan and an end to  sanctions."    Republic of Srpska president Radovan Karadzic expressed the  following hopes: "The EC should make its move and fulfill what  it should fulfill -- this means lifting the sanctions."    Montenegrin President Momir Bulatovic stressed: "In all our  work so far and all our results, as well as in the commitments  expressed by the Assembly of the Serbian republic yesterday, we  have repeatedly displayed our commitment to finalizing the peace  process. This requires agreement on the part of the Muslims and  the Croatian side. I hope that the Muslim side will stop  obstructing and I believe that the international community will  bring pressure to bear on the Muslim side, if not today then in  the near future. This is the sole matter to be addressed to  have a peace agreement signed."    According to Bulatovic, head of the Montenegrin state, the  lifting of sanctions has been included in the mainframe of a  general agreement. He also said that the situation in the  country precludes it from staking everything on the  international community's words and trustworthiness. [passage  omitted]</p>

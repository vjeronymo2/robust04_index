			<p>941129 FT  29 NOV 94 / Argentina challenger picked Argentina's opposition Radical party has picked Mr Horacio Massaccesi, governor of Rio Negro province, as its challenger to President Carlos Menem in next May's presidential elections. The Frente Amplio, an opposition coalition, has postponed nominating its presidential candidate for next year's elections, expected to be won convincingly by Mr Menem. Mr Massaccesi defeated rival Mr Federico Storani by a wide margin, partly as a result of backing from former Radical president Mr Raul Alfonsin, and from powerful Cordoba governor Mr Eduardo Angeloz. Mr Massaccesi now faces the task of fortifying a Radical party plagued by poor results in recent elections and riven by internal conflict. 'The next step is to create party unity' so that we 'can offer Argentinians alternative proposals to official policies of backwardness and social injustice,' Mr Massaccesi said in his victory speech.</p>

			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Canadian investor builds 3.6% stake in Amstrad A CANADIAN investment company has built up a 3.57 per cent shareholding in Amstrad, the consumer electronics group, following holders rejection of a 30p per share buy back bid from Mr Alan Sugar, the founder and chairman, earlier this month. Amstrad said yesterday that it was informed at the start of September that Peter Cundill, which manages two Bermuda mutual funds, held 13.41m shares, or a 2.31 per cent equity stake, in the group in its capacity as investment manager on behalf of eight institutional accounts under its management. On Thursday the investment company told Amstrad that it had increased its shareholding to 20.75m shares on behalf of the eight managed accounts. Mr Sugar holds a personal 35 per cent equity stake in Amstrad and had sought to take the company private again with an unsuccessful Pounds 113m buy-back bid. Two other Amstrad directors sold their equity stakes in the company earlier this week for 23 1/8 p a share. The shares closed  1/2 p lower at 24p yesterday. Cundill has built a reputation as a shrewd investor in difficult stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. Among its recent and most prominent investments in the UK, the company holds a large preference share stake in TVS Entertainment, the southern TV broadcaster which loses its franchise on January 1. TVS is seeking shareholder approval for a takeover bid by US-based International Family Entertainment, which is controlled by Mr Pat Robertson, the television evangelist. Cundill, with more than a 15 per cent preference share stake, has opposed the deal. Cundill also emerged as a shareholder in Henlys Group, the motor trader and bus and coach builder, during T Cowie's Pounds 32.1m unsuccessful hostile bid in September.</p>

			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: Land and House plans two bond issues LAND and House, the Thai property developer, yesterday announced plans to launch a Dollars 60m convertible bond, expected to be listed in London, and a Bt2bn (Dollars 78.7m) bond for the Thai market. The company said it was seeking shareholders' approval for the issues and for an increase in its capital to Bt5bn from Bt1.5bn. Of 350m new Bt10 bonds, 175m will be set aside for buyers who wish to exercise their rights. Land and House will use Bt3bn of the money raised to reduce debt and the rest to buy land and property. Unconsolidated third quarter net profits rose 68 per cent to Bt314m over the same period last year, prompting a string of buy recommendations from brokers. Bangkok Land, Thailand's biggest property company, last month announced plans to borrow money abroad to finance expansion. The company said it intended to issue SFr50m (Dollars 35.7m) of notes for Swiss investors through a Cayman Islands subsidiary.</p>

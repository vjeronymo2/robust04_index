			<p>BFN     [Text] The latest developments in the Balkans in the region  of Gorazde showed "the extreme unskillfulness of American  diplomacy, its impulsiveness and high dependence on internal  political changes," Chairman of the parliamentary committee for  international relations Vladimir Lukin told a briefing in the  State Duma.    Lukin also pointed to "the weakness and dissociation of the  Russian policy both at the inter-ministerial level, and at the  level of interaction between the Foreign Ministry and the  presidential administration. Our diplomacy decided to exert  pressure on the Serbs in a rougher way, using a personal  factor," he noted.    In Lukin's opinion, this factor lies in "the halo of heroism  around two successful trips by our leaders to the Balkans,"  created by the media, having in view Foreign Minister Andrey  Kozyrev and his deputy, representative of the Russian president  in former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin. Such coverage of the  trips, he said, led to the fact that "the mission of our leading  diplomat turned out to be counter-productive."    Lukin pointed out that neither Russia, nor the West in  isolation can handle the situation in the Balkans and they  should act in coordination with each other.    Lukin said that upon return of the parliamentary delegation  from former Yugoslavia, his committee intends to work out  recommendations for the president on adjustment of the policy  toward the Balkans. He noted that these recommendations "will  also concern the gradual lifting of sanctions against republics  of former Yugoslavia if they fulfil certain conditions."</p>

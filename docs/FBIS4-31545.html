			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Privatization Minister Milan Janicina by </F> Ivan Stulajter; place and date not given: "One Has To Listen  Even to Those Who View Things Differently!"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Stulajter] Judging from the  debate at the recent general assembly of the Union of Industry,  the greatest resistance to coupon privatization can be expected  from those circles....    [Janicina] Mr. Borovsky, the new chairman of the Union of  Industry, sent me a letter in which he insists that each  privatization project be discussed with his organization. I do  not know how they got this idea because the Union of Industry  has no jurisdiction over these matters. In the same letter, Mr.  Borovsky expressed the view that the ideal share of companies'  property earmarked for coupon privatization would be 5-10  percent. Everything suggests that, like Economy Minister Peter  Magvasi, he would recommend privatization by the management in  most cases. I am not principally opposed to this, but there  should be no payment in installments in such cases; the money  must be put on the table. Even Deputy Prime Minister Brigita  Schmognerova agrees with me on this point.    [Stulajter] Although at first glance this looks like a  problem of the privatization concept and privatization  techniques, it cannot be ruled out that, on the hidden plane, it  is primarily a political problem.    [Janicina] This cannot be ruled out. For example, I have  reservations about the term "tried-and-tested management"  because what we are talking about are, to a smaller or greater  degree, communist cadres who are trying to gain economic and,  subsequently, also political power. On the other hand, there  should be no generalization. I realize that there are factories  that will fall on their face if their management leaves. When  the management is competent and able to pay, it is a contender  like any other, from my point of view. I do not have the right  to discriminate against people in privatization only because  they are members of the Party of the Democratic Left [SDL] or  because they were in the communist party in the past, and I am  not going to discriminate against them. As for the concept of  privatization, the fact remains that some SDL representatives  regard coupon privatization as property distribution, which is  not the task of this government, in their opinion. From my  viewpoint, coupon privatization is, first and foremost,  privatization.    [Stulajter] The last amendment to the law on large-scale  privatization increased the powers of your ministry. Under this  amendment, the ministry can determine the terms, extent, and  method of privatization. Are you determined to use your powers  in extreme situations, defying the "resistance" of other  government departments and various interest lobbies?    [Janicina] I intend to use but not abuse those powers. This  means that whenever different views on some matters arise in the  government, I will prefer talks to confrontation. One has to  listen even to those who view things differently.</p>

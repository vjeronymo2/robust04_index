			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / Management: Clipped wings for high flyers - Daniel Green on the new austerity in spending on business air fares Last Christmas, the managing director of a City securities house lectured his staff on business travel costs. Some Pounds 1m needed to be cut off the Pounds 6m annual spend, he said. First- and business-class seats should be bought only if absolutely necessary. A consultant was brought in who found that the MD had been buying most of the first-class tickets himself. The City may be one of the last places in Britain where company directors are happy for shareholders to pay for their caviar and vintage champagne. For most of the rest of the country, the rules and budgets are getting tighter as travel managers are drawn into cost-cutting exercises. 'I can't think of a time in the last two years when the chairman bought a first-class ticket,' says Barry Burnley, deputy group purchasing agent at GKN, the engineering group. 'We encourage everyone to travel economy, but senior managers and above travel business class. Budget-holders are expected to make sensible decisions.' ICI is even stricter. 'The budget is more important than the trip,' says Roger Glenwright, business services manager. 'The class of travel should never be more expensive than the minimum that will do the job. By and large that means travelling economy.' For short journeys, ICI is moving towards a policy of buying a discounted economy ticket for the outward leg of the journey and a flexible fare - full-price economy or business class - on the way back. 'Our studies show that 80 per cent of flight changes, if a trip has to be cut short or extended, happen on the return leg,' says Glenwright. ICI's top executives still go business class for long-haul flights. But for everyone else 'it's cheaper to send them a day early and give them a day to recover than to send them business class,' he says. Such arguments cut little ice with many Continental-owned companies, for which business travel means just that. 'The policy is that everyone travels club class,' says Barbara Kelly, administration manager at Roche Products, part of the Swiss drug company. 'But we are rigid about the justification to go. The biggest savings come from not going if the trip does not justify it; authorisation must be signed by a director,' she adds. US-owned companies also like to send everyone in the same class. IBM (UK) has an economy-only ruling for all short-haul and flights to the east coast of the US, even for the chief executive. Only the west coast and far east justify business class. Norman Ryan, corporate service manager at US-owned oil services company Halliburton Holdings, says US companies are especially tough on air travel costs. All but the top few per cent in his company travel economy, 'and at the cheapest fare available', he says. Top executives travel business class only if the flight is longer than six hours. Length of journey rules also apply at EDS-Scicon, the Heathrow-based US-owned computer services company. 'Everybody except directors travels economy unless the journey including connections is over 12 hours,' says Catherine Ketley, manager of international travel. 'Directors go business class.' There may be a danger in allowing the principle of upgrades for long journeys. More old-fashioned luxuries can begin to work their way back into the system. At Guinness, the multinational drinks group, there is a complex formula in which some staff travelling eastbound overnight can go first class. Its main board and top six executives always travel first class, the next 450 in seniority normally go business class. The remaining 23,500 employees are eligible only for economy, if they travel at all. Even this policy represents something of a downgrading from the good old days for the company: until 1987, the directors had the use of a corporate jet. But Guinness is unusual in other ways, too. It is one of the few companies not to have reviewed its corporate travel policy as economic conditions got tougher. GKN all but eliminated first class and Concorde two years ago when 'there was a realisation that travel was both important and expensive. It was substantially more free and easy before that,' says Burnley. British Aerospace has also changed its rules. 'We used to have a seniority-based system. That's been replaced with a business needs system which focuses on the need to travel,' says Andrew Fletcher, BAe's company secretary. 'The recession has caused the company to re-address a whole series of costs including travel and expenses.' Fletcher has a broader view than most of business travel trends. He is chairman of the Business Travel Liaison Group, a body of 20 large organisations including BP, IBM (UK), Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, and the British Council, that lobbies airlines. For him, a cost-conscious approach is more than just a consequence of the recession; it reflects a change in management practice. 'It used to be the case that the managing director went first class, the sales director went business class and everyone else went economy. Now it is more egalitarian.' Business class may still be the norm for senior executives, but travel managers are more likely to be trying to secure bargain prices for good seats for everyone than exhorting juniors to travel economy. The egalitarian message may nevertheless take some time to get through to the City. The MD of the securities house still travels first class. No one has dared tell him he is the man he warned his staff about.</p>

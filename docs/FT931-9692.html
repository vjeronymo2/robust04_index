			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / World Trade News: Brittan brings trade policy charges SIR Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, yesterday opened legal proceedings against three of the Community's most liberal traders - Britain, the Netherlands and Germany - for undermining a common trade policy. The announcement was condemned by British and German officials in Brussels as 'astonishing' and 'ridiculous', and attacked as a thinly veiled attempt to push through controversial Commission proposals to accelerate EC anti-dumping procedure. Sir Leon believes the countries have broken EC law by taking unilateral action to abolish or extend national quotas on goods from 'state trading countries' - China, Vietnam and North Korea. Existing quotas expired when the single market began on January 1, and Sir Leon claims member states should have asked for Brussels' permission to extend or abolish them. The products affected include shoes, gloves, toys and crockery. Formal letters of complaint will now be sent and if the Commission is not satisfied with the replies it could eventually take the countries to the European Court of Justice. The harmonisation of quotas is linked to anti-dumping proposals which Britain, Germany and the Netherlands claim will give Brussels too much control over the EC's arsenal of trade weapons. The Commission says it cannot separate the quota problem from its proposals on trade weapons, because southern member states such as France will not agree to harmonise or abolish import restrictions unless anti-dumping procedure is speeded. 'If you talk to importers around the Community, they are in complete confusion about who they answer to and what they are meant to do,' said Sir Leon's spokesman yesterday. 'The risk is that by renationalising quotas they are undermining the single market: one country which might like to maintain limits on imports cannot because another has (unilaterally) opened its borders.' But British diplomats yesterday blamed the Commission for not coming up with an alternative interim strategy. 'We think (the Commission) is wrong legally and wrong politically,' said one. Both Britain and the Netherlands have extended last year's quotas until the end of March, while Germany has gone for full liberalisation, abolishing its remaining restrictions. Denmark, Italy and Greece have all sought Commission authorisation for interim measures.</p>

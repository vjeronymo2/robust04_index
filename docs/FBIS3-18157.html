			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Kimmo Salin report: "Ecobus Prototype To Be Released in </F> March"]    [Text] Work on Saab-Valmet's newest project, a small  ecological bus developed at the company's production facility,  is progressing. Saab-Valmet CEO Juhani Linnoinen said that the  finished product will be presented in March. The bus prototype  from Uusikaupunki has also attracted interest abroad, Linnoinen  said: "Selling is going to be easier when we can show the  ready-made product," he added.  <H5>  Low Effect on Employment </H5>   Linnoinen does not believe, however, that the bus project  will solve the employment situation at Saab-Valmet. The  production of this bus will not have any greater impact on  manpower requirements, but it will help the plant to keep its  high technology know-how in house.    This project represents an effort by Saab-Valmet to make use  of technologies from car manufacturing to rationalize the  production of buses. The product, which is now in its prototype  phase, is a good example of cooperation within the Finnish  transport equipment industry.    "Our bus has a gas-diesel engine from Valmet and shafting  from Sisu. We are aiming for a high degree of domestic content,  about 90 percent."  <H5>  A New Model Is Still Needed </H5>   Even with a positive sales launch, the Ecobus does not solve  Saab-Valmet's problems in its search for a new model to  complement production of the new Saab 900 convertible and the  Opel Calibra.    Production of the convertible begins next April. The car,  which took part in automobile exhibitions in Detroit and  Stockholm, was received favorably, according to Linnoinen.    "This year's production volume will depend on how many units  we can make before the end of the convertible season. We aim to  maintain at least the same production volume as for the previous  Saab Cabriolet."    Linnoinen mentions that, as of April, the Uusikaupunki plant  will start producing the Calibra according to the production  figures laid down in the new agreement. A court of arbitration  obliged Opel some time ago to transfer 45 percent of production  of the Calibra back to Uusikaupunki until 1996. GM is expected  to produce 27,000 Calibra cars this year.    GM tried to transfer the entire Calibra production to  Germany  on the basis of its claim that the production cost for one  Calibra was 4,000-5,000 DM [Deutsche marks] higher in  Uusikaupunki than in Germany. GM would therefore, according to  this calculation, have to pay $34 million for producing more  than 12,000 Calibra cars in Uusikaupunki.    Linnoinen replied that the result depends on the method of  calculation, i.e., how the various cost factors are taken into  account.</p>

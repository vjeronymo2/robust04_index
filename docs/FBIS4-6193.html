			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 16 (YONHAP) -- Russia hopes to handle  resettlement of North Korean loggers in Siberia without  intervention by an international organization, Foreign Minister  Andrey Kozyrev said Friday.    Radio Moscow quoted him as saying that his country will be  strict with human rights protection requirements in renewing the  logging contract with North Korea.    Moscow should consider applying Russia's domestic laws on  all  people living on Russian soil, and their human rights have to be  guaranteed at maximum level, Kozyrev said according to Radio  Moscow.    But he indicated his country was against intervention by a  third party, saying Moscow plans to resolve the issue without  participation by international organizations.    The Seoul Government announced Friday it will accept all  North Korean loggers who wish to settle in South Korea. Some  100 North Koreans, virtually trapped inside logging camps in  Siberia where escapees tell of rampant beating and near  starvation, have asked to be sent to Seoul.    Seoul officials said they want to refer to the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in arranging their  resettlement.    The logging contract between Russia and North Korea was to  expire at the end of last year but the two sides are still  negotiating renewal after Moscow demanded human rights condition  improvement inside the camps.    Next negotiation is expected in Moscow within first half of  this year.</p>

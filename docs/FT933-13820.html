			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Chalker warns Tory loyalists THE CONSERVATIVE party risks destroying itself, 'certainly for a few years', if it brings down Mr John Major as prime minister, Baroness Chalker, the foreign office minister, says in an interview today. She says the 'old guard' who nominated Mr Major for the party leadership 'are letting him down . . . frankly if the party destroys him, it will destroy itself'. Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister who led the Lords revolt on Wednesday over the Maastricht Treaty, 'must be very lonely for real friends', Lady Chalker says in Harpers &amp; Queen magazine.</p>

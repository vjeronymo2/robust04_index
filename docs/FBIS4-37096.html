			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has appealed to the  religious scholars and believers in different schools of thought  to maintain utmost discipline and caution and foil the nefarious  designs of inimical forces by observing Muharramul Haram [holy  month of Muharram] in a peaceful and orderly manner.    She was addressing the 14th annual Hussainia Conference in  Islambad today. The prime minister said the government has  undeniable proof of a conspiracy hatched by an inimical  neighboring country to inject or hire citizens or some saboteurs  so as to create law and order problems by airing harsh sectarian  feelings [sentence as heard]. The government is alive and alert  to its duties and would take firm measures to maintaining smooth  law and order. She said the chief ministers of the provinces  have already been directed to adopt stringent steps in this  regard. In its bid to cow down Pakistan to desist from venting  a principled moral and diplomatic support to the consensus  Kashmir cause [as heard], the neighboring country has hatched  conspiracies one after the other to create internal problems for  Pakistan. The prime minister said with the help and support of  the people and by making use of all machinery at its command the  government would frustrate such nefarious designs.</p>

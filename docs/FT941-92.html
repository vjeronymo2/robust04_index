			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Simon Eng calls for Pounds 52.5m to reduce debt Simon Engineering, maker of access equipment including fire rescue gear, yesterday announced a 5-for-9 rights issue to raise Pounds 52.5m after finally completing complex negotiations with its lenders. The group is proposing to issue 55.9m new shares at 100p. The issue will be fully underwritten by Hill Samuel and SG Warburg. The shares closed at 118 1/2 p, down 3p on the day. Simon said the issue would significantly strengthen the balance sheet and sharply reduce debt, enhancing its ability to win new business and pursue a measured disposal strategy. The issue was flagged earlier this month when the group announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 160.3m for 1993. Mr Maurice Dixson, chief executive, said the rights would be the cornerstone to put the group on a sound financial footing. Since he joined the group last September, Mr Dixson has concentrated on driving down debt through a programme of tighter controls and disposals. Net borrowings have fallen since then from Pounds 148m to Pounds 127m. After the rights issue the group's gearing is expected to fall from 264 per cent to 67.3 per cent, with a further reduction by the end of the year. Simon's negotiations with its lenders have been protracted because of the number of banks involved. Its new banking and bonding facilities will be provided by Lloyds and Barclays in the UK and the Fifth Third Bank in the US on completion of the rights issue. They will allow Simon to reduce its outstanding US loan notes from Dollars 125m to Dollars 80m (Pounds 54.7m) and to repay most of its existing bank debt.</p>

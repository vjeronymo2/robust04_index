			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Survey of Tennessee (9): First few steps abroad prove costly, painful - Profile / Federal Express Not many years from now, the fortunes of Tennessee's biggest private sector employer will be forged far away - in Europe, largely, and Asia. But if future prosperity lies abroad, the first steps have been painful ones. Over the past three years, Federal Express has lost about Dollars 1.2bn, including restructuring charges, in its attempt to create a world-beating international package delivery and air freight service. The losses are at least getting smaller: Dollars 182m last year, on revenues of Dollars 2.1bn, after a decision at the end of 1992 to cut back operations in Europe. This year, says Mr Alan Graf, chief financial officer, the company's international business will finally turn the corner, reaching break-even. In the long run, he adds, the bulk of the company's profits is likely to come from abroad. What happens in the skies over far-off countries is of vital interest in west Tennessee. It is difficult to overstate the importance of Federal Express to the local economy. If there is one industry that dominates Memphis, it is distribution. And if there is one company that dominates the Memphis distribution industry, it is Federal Express. The package delivery company's fast growth over the past two decades has created many thousands of new jobs in the area directly - it now employs 20,000 people - and helped encourage many others to locate their businesses in or around the city. A distributor based in Memphis can drop its goods off at the Federal Express hub late in the evening and have them delivered anywhere in the country by the next morning. There were two factors that made Federal Express's initial foray into international markets a disaster. One was its purchase of Flying Tigers, an airfreight company, just as a slowdown in the worldwide economy hit the airfreight business hard. 'We knew that the business would be subject to cyclicality. It was a risk we took with our eyes open, and it cost us some money,' says Mr Graf. The second - and more costly - mistake was a misconceived attempt to recreate in Europe the company's success in its home market. To that end, Federal Express went about building an extensive network inside Europe - but then failed to win enough volume to justify the costs. 'We had a belief that we could develop the same synergies and economies of scale that we had in the US. (But) the size of the market is much smaller in Europe,' says Mr Graf. Federal Express's meteoric rise in the US, from its founding in 1972, owes much to the development of just-in-time manufacturing techniques and new methods of inventory control: customers found it cheaper to send or received small items from around the country by express mail, rather than to keep them in stock. The company bet on the same process sweeping Europe, and was proved wrong. Also, Federal Express failed to break the strong hold on the European package delivery business of a number of powerful rivals. 'One of the things we had hoped for is that people would make a single-carrier choice,' using the same carrier to ship a package inside Europe that they used to deliver items to the US, says Mr Michael Glenn, senior vice-president in charge of marketing and communications. That didn't happen. The company has now scrapped the attempt to become a regional carrier in Europe, contenting itself instead with operating a transatlantic service. The break-through into profitability in the international businesses, when it comes, will signal an important milestone in the company's history. Founded in 1972, Federal Express has a dominant share of the overnight parcel market in the US. Yet that business is getting steadily less profitable. For a start, much of the company's business is with big customers who are able to negotiate large discounts. 'We have no control over pricing in the US,' says Mr Graf. A second problem is that many customers are turning away from the most expensive, and therefore profitable, overnight priority service towards less costly services. The decline in margins is evident from the figures. The volume of packages carried in the US leapt from 312m in 1991 to 406m in 1993 - yet over that period, the proportion of priority overnight packages dropped from six out of every 10 pieces carried to five out of every 10. Largely as a result, the company's revenues in the US grew at a slower rate, from Dollars 5.1bn in 1991 to Dollars 5.7bn last year. Its operating income slid from Dollars 671m to Dollars 559m. For all that, the express package delivery business remains a strong growth business in the US. 'It's difficult to find another business growing at the same rate,' says Mr Graf. The key for Federal Express is to bring down its costs for each package shipped in line with its revenue-per-package - something it failed to do last year. New technology is the answer. It will also have to avoid the sort of costly mistakes it has made in the past. According to Mr Glenn: 'E-mail could have an impact - how much, we don't know.' However, Federal Express claims to have already been through the worst, reducing the pressure on it to respond. 'You can't fax hard goods,' says Mr Glenn. 'The amount of goods that is still document-related and could be transmitted another way is very small. We believe we have suffered substantially all of the dilution already.'</p>

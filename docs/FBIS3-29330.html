In this respect the government decided to  develop such projects gradually, step by step and charged the  National Development Department and the Ministry of Food and  Agriculture to discuss and solve proper issues concerning  credits to be granted to provide the implementation of the  present projects as well as foreign investment and credits to be  assigned for this purpose.    As was shown by the results of the experiments carried out  during the last years in the country it is quite possible for  the sugarbeet and oil-producing crops to be cultivated under the  conditions of Mongolia. It was established during the  experiments that approximately 2025 tonnes of sugar beet and  1.52 tonnes of raps [as received] may be gathered per hectare.    Mongolia has to import some 45 thousand tonnes of granulated  sugar and 4.5 tonnes of vegetable oil every year.</p>

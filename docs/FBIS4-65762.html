			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] State Minister Aykon Dogan has said that the  preliminary results of the economic stability program are  positive. He pointed out that the results in domestic and  foreign borrowing, budget deficits, the foreign trade balance,  and inflation are in line with the targets of the program.    In a statement he issued today, Dogan said that the tax  revenues and domestic borrowing levels in April were in line  with the program and that public expenditures were kept within  the limits of the program. There was no delay in the repayment  of foreign debts or of their interest, he said, adding that the  positive results of the efforts to collect public revenues were  observed in April.    Dogan stressed that the restriction of public expenditures  will continue vigorously, as envisaged by the 5 April decisions.  He pointed out that the monthly average of the  January-February-March public deficit was 17.3 trillion Turkish  lira [TL], while in April this figure dropped to TL5.2 trillion.    The consolidated budget deficit for April-May-June has been  estimated at TL10 trillion, he said, and this target will be  reached if the balance in the planned budget revenues and  expenditures is maintained in May.    Aykon Dogan pointed out that the IMF's complete approval of  the program was an important development. This has created  resources of up to $600 million in 1994, he said, as well as  World Bank project loans of up to $1.2 billion. Furthermore, he  added, this creates the possibility of private foreign credit  channels.    The state minister explained that as a result of the  measures  and of the realistic foreign exchange rate policy, imports  became expensive and exports attractive. The exporters now work  on the basis of insured guarantees, which is a modern practice,  he said.    Dogan announced that exports in April rose to $1.4 billion  while imports dropped to $2.1 billion. He added: In April, the  ratio of exports to imports rose to 65 percent.    Dogan further said that a drop in the monthly rate of  inflation will be observed in May. He said that an increase of  less than 10 percent is expected both in the consumer price  index and in the wholesale price index. This is an important  sign of a healthy economy, he said.    Dogan said: Obviously, the program is difficult and calls  for sacrifice. However, the sacrifice is being made by all  sectors of the community.    He pointed out if implemented without concessions, the  program will reduce the dimensions of the sacrifice in the  coming months. Then the economy will surely recover and develop,  he stressed.</p>

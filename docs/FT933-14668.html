			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / International Company News: Avonmore buys Dairy Crest arm for Pounds 20m AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and meat group, has moved into fifth place in the UK liquid milk market with the Pounds 20.5m purchase of two dairies and 32 distribution depots from Dairy Crest, the milk and dairy products side of the Milk Marketing Board. The dairies are in Birmingham and Hereford, and mainly supply doorstep deliveries. Avonmore is already strong in Birmingham and the West Midlands and has a sizeable business with supermarkets in the area. It also wants to expand in the south. Dairy Crest is reconfiguring its milk capacity as a result of the falling volume of milk sold on doorsteps and the shift to producing for supermarkets. It has also completed its sale to Unigate of Marshfield Dairy in Cardiff. Mr Pat O'Neill, Avonmore group managing director, said the changes in the UK milk industry, which will take place next year when the MMB is abolished, presented Avonmore with an opportunity to use skills developed in Ireland where the industry has been deregulated for over a century. The acquisition will give Avonmore an extra 39m gallons of liquid milk volume, taking its total to over 85m gallons, or 7 per cent of the UK liquid milk market. Avonmore also buys milk for cheese manufacture, and, with the liquid milk, will buy a total of 130m gallons a year. The businesses Avonmore is buying have net assets of Pounds 19.7m, and make annual sales of Pounds 87m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.6m. Avonmore is paying Pounds 10m on completion with a further Pounds 10.5m next January. Mr O'Neill said the group's cash flow would cover the consideration without raising gearing, currently 65 per cent. Avonmore said the integration of two dairies in Wiltshire and Hampshire acquired last November was proceeding to plan. Avonmore shares rose 7p to 150p.</p>

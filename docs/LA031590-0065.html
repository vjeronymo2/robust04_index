			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> IN TOURISM PUSH, STATE SEEKS ITS OWN;  </P> <P> MARKETING: NEARLY A THIRD OF NEXT FISCAL YEAR'S PROPOSED BUDGET OF $7.3 MILLION  HAS BEEN EARMARKED TO TRY TO GET CALIFORNIANS TO VACATION IN THE STATE.  </P> <P> The state's top tourism official said Wednesday that her office hopes to use a  35% increase in next year's promotion budget to get Californians to see more of  the Golden State.  </P> <P> State Office of Tourism Director Flo Snyder, speaking at the seventh annual  Governor's Convention on Tourism in Anaheim, said that nearly a third of next  fiscal year's proposed budget of $7.3 million has been earmarked for in-state  marketing efforts.  </P> <P> The proposed budget, which has been sent by Gov. George Deukmejian to the  Legislature for approval, would amount to an increase of $1.9 million over the  state's $5.4-million tourism budget for the fiscal year ending June 30.  </P> <P> The in-state marketing program would be primarily aimed at couples, 25 years or  older with household incomes in excess of $35,000, to try to persuade them to  vacation in California rather than someplace else, state tourism officials  said.  </P> <P> About 29% of the proposed promotion budget would be spent to lure the state's  residents to vacation in California. About 60% would be used to lure visitors  from other states and the remaining 11% would be spent to attract foreign  tourists.  </P> <P> Snyder said the new plan would include advertisements for Orange County  attractions.  </P> <P> The state also intends to continue its print campaign for "The Californias," an  advertising theme designed to encourage tourists to explore more of the state's  diverse locales.  </P> <P> But even with the increased tourism budget, Snyder said California -- which  reaps more tourism dollars than any other state -- is not spending enough to  attract visitors.  </P> <P> The state spent 5 cents on tourism promotion for every visitor in 1988 and the  average visitor spent $336 during his stay, according to the state Office of  Tourism.  </P> <P> Other states spend four times as much to attract visitors who may, on average,  spend less during their stay.  </P> <P> Asked if the budget was adequate, Snyder replied: "If we're talking about  meeting the competition from other states and countries, no, it's not. We have  to be prepared to meet the competition."  </P> <P> Those warnings were echoed in a luncheon speech by Edward R. Book, president of  the Travel Industry Assn., a major tourism-related trade organization, who  warned that California could lose its premier status as a tourist destination  unless it concentrates more on promoting itself.  </P></p>

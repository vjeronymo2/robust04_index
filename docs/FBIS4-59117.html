			<p>BFN     [Text] About 150 Palestinian policemen crossed into the  Gaza Strip from Egypt this evening. They were the first group  to enter Gaza under the Israel-PLO agreement signed in Cairo  last week. Thousands of Palestinians gathered in Rafah to greet  the policemen, who drove across the border in buses and U.S.  donated military vehicles. They are headed for Dayr al-Balah,  where they will be stationed in the present Civil Administration  building. They were wearing olive-green uniforms and berets,  and waved Palestinian flags.    Qol Yisra'el's correspondent on the spot reports that there  is much excitement among the local population seeing the first  sign of the transfer of power. Before their arrival, the new  Palestinian police commander in Gaza, Nasr Yusuf, held a joint  news conference with the IDF's [Israel Defense Forces] Brigadier  General Yom-Tov Sami'. Yusuf called it a historic day for the  Palestinian people; the first day on the road to their  independence. And, he added, we hope to have good relations  with all our neighbors.    Earlier today, Israeli officials began handing over offices  and supplies to Palestinian officials in Jericho. It was the  start of a two-day handover. The actual transfer of power is to  take place on Thursday [12 May]. The entry of Palestinian  police into Jericho is expected tomorrow.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 27 (XINHUA) -- The standing committee  of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held its seventh meeting here  today, focusing on agriculture.    Li Ruihuan, chairman of the CPPCC National Committee,  presided over the meeting.    He said that, as agriculture is the foundation of the  national economy, its development has a direct impact on the  economy, people's life and social stability.    The agricultural issue is very much a matter of concern for  the people, he said. The central committee of the Communist  Party of China (CPC) and the State Council attach great  importance to agriculture, having worked out a series of  important policies.    Li pointed out that, as an institution participating in and  discussing state and government affairs, the CPPCC is bound to  be concerned about China's agriculture and give its suggestions  and opinions on the issue.    Chinese State Councillor Chen Junsheng attended the meeting  and delivered a report on agriculture.    Chen said that, in general, the current situation of  agriculture and the rural economy is good. The country has  achieved good harvests for many years successively, the rural  economy has achieved consistent and all-round development, and  farmers'income and living standards have improved.    But, he noted, some problems still exist in China's  agriculture and rural economy, which can not be ignored, in the  process of the rapid development of the national economy and  readjustment of the economic system.    Chen said that the problems are mainly an imbalance in  general grain supply and demand, disequilibrium of agricultural  production structure between areas, gap between cotton supply  and demand, uneven production of vegetables, slow increase of  farmers' income, lack of funds, unemployment of rural laborers,  constant growth of rural population and shrinking of cultivated  land.    The development of agriculture also faces a shortage of  scientists and technicians, a withering of agriculture  production in the coastal areas and hiking of the prices of farm  production materials. Also there are 80 million  poverty-stricken people in the rural areas, Chen added.    Chen spoke highly of the CPPCC's concern about and  contributions to China's agriculture and rural economy. The  members have put forward many opinions and suggestions for  building up a new and prosperous countryside in China, he noted.    He expressed the hope that the CPPCC would continue making  contributions to the development of agriculture and the rural  economy.    The five-day meeting will also discuss reports on CPPCC  members' tours of Anhui, Henan and Shanxi Provinces, on Li  Ruihuan's visit to five western and northern European countries,  the visit of Wu Xueqian, vice-chairman of the CPPCC National  Committee, to the Republic of Korea, and a report on a CPPCC  delegation's visit to Jordan and Djibouti.    The meeting will also discuss and adopt a list of  appointments and removals concerning the Eighth National  Committee of the CPPCC.</p>

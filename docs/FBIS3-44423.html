The three-day forum will be the second of its kind, the  first  being held in Beijing and Shanghai in September 1992.    A 20-member mainland delegation is expected. It will be the  first time in more than four decades that mainland Chinese  insurance experts have visited Taiwan.    Sponsored by the National Insurance Institute, the forum  will  focus on insurance rules and regulations, future trends, and the  division of social and business insurance.</p>

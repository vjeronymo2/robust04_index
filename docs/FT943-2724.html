			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Region revives as Nikkei gains are eroded Profit-taking and arbitrage selling depressed share prices in low volume after Thursday's holiday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 index closed down 123.12 at 19,796.26 after a high of 19,972.59 and a low of 19,795.26, for a week's loss of 0.5 per cent. The index rose in the morning session on index-linked buying prompted by the stronger dollar against the yen and the sharp rise in US stock prices on Thursday. However, position adjustments ahead of the weekend and profit-taking by corporate investors eroded the gains. Volume was 251m shares against 265m. The Topix index of all first section stocks declined 7.75 to 1,576.21, and the Nikkei 300 lost 1.29 to 287.95. Declines outnumbered advances by 700 to 267, with 199 issues unchanged. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index slipped 0.20 to 1,288.29. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, the most active issue of the day, fell Y10 to Y743 on selling by overseas investors. Other large capital issues were also actively traded with Nippon Steel down Y1 to Y376 and NKK down Y4 to Y275. Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y20 to Y1,600 on worries about oversupply. The company is expected to raise some Y200bn in convertible bonds next month. Other high-tech stocks were also weak in spite of the rise in the dollar. Hitachi fell Y8 to Y956 and NEC lost Y30 to Y1,170. Speculative favourites were higher. Hanwa, the steel trader, rose Y24 to Y434 and Sanrio added Y40 to Y1,470.

Turnover eased from Won883.4bn to Won733.1bn. Brokers said that the government appeared to scale down selling intervention in later trading, resulting in upbeat buying interest in blue chips like Kepco and Korean Air; both went limit-up, rising Won1,300 to Won35,800, and by Won1,000 to Won26,600. HONG KONG was revived by late buying which left the Hang Seng index 105.88 higher at 9,968.52, down 1.7 per cent on the week, as turnover rose from HKDollars 3.44bn to a provisional HKDollars 3.92bn.

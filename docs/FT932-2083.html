			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / Mirror faces Pounds 6m claim for rent MIRROR GROUP Newspapers will be in default by Pounds 6m on the rent of its London headquarters at the end of this month, as a decision looms on the group's new location. Mr Maurice Withall, the receiver to Robert Maxwell Estates, MGN's landlord, at accountants Grant Thornton, confirmed yesterday that MGN would be delinquent for the third successive quarter if it did not pay rent at the end of June. Robert Maxwell Estates, which was part of the private Maxwell business empire, is the landlord to the Holborn site in central London, and the immediate tenant on the property is Maxwell Communication Corporation. But because MCC is in administration under English insolvency law, Mr Withall has taken legal action to pursue MGN, the sub-tenant, for payment. MGN relented after originally refusing to pay rent from the point at which the Maxwell empire collapsed in late 1991. It stopped paying rent again from the quarter ending last December. It argues that it should be able to offset the payments against money from MCC, which has not been provided. Mr Withall is suing MGN for the outstanding amounts. He has offered the company a settlement as part of negotiations for the sale of the site to the newspaper group.</p>

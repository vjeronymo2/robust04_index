			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / O&amp;Y faces threat to scrap Canary lease AMERICAN EXPRESS, the financial services group, said yesterday it would abandon plans to move 1,500 staff to Canary Wharf, the Pounds 1.5bn project in London Docklands that is in administration, unless contractual obligations were met. The group has filed in US and Canadian courts to notify Olympia &amp; York, owner of Canary Wharf, that payments totalling Pounds 22m due to American Express under a lease agreement have not been made. Under the 30-year lease signed by American Express in June 1990, O&amp;Y agreed to provide a fitting-out fund and to assume certain obligations for premises now occupied by American Express in London. On April 1 this year, O&amp;Y was due to pay Amex Pounds 31m, which was the unspent balance of its fitting-out fund and Pounds 8.5m in respect of takeover leases. By May 28, the date Canary Wharf went into administration, O&amp;Y still owed American Express Pounds 22m. 'We would reiterate that American Express has no intention of completing the lease provided for in the agreement or of moving to the premises unless they are satisfied that (the developers) intend, and are in a position, to honour all of their obligations,' lawyers for American Express said a letter to O&amp;Y on Thursday. The payments concern fitting out the Canary Wharf building and indemnity against continuing liability on existing premises. Olympia &amp; York agreed to take on 240,000 sq ft of space occupied by Shearson Lehman, the investment banking subsidiary of American Express, at Broadgate in the City of London. A decision by American Express to pull out of Canary Wharf would be a serious blow for the project. As one of Canary Wharf's most prominent tenants, its withdrawal would further undermine the possibility of creating a prestigious business centre in Docklands. Other tenants are reviewing plans to move to Canary Wharf, which could leave the project substantially unlet. Leases have been signed on 60 per cent of the first phases, but only 14 per cent of the tenants are installed. The administrators' dilemma is that incentives offered by Olympia &amp; York to tenants were so generous that it could be cheaper to persuade them not to move. Olympia &amp; York's policy was to ask high rents for space at Canary Wharf, while offering large incentives to sweeten the deals for tenants in the early phases of the project. Bankers believe that many of these deals do not make sense now the project is in administration. Canary Wharf's administrators, Stephen Adamson, Nigel Hamilton and Alan Bloom of Ernst &amp; Young, are due to present their initial proposals for the future of the project next Wednesday.</p>

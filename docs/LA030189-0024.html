			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TV REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> SELF-RIGHTEOUS 'PROMISES' LOOKS AT HOMELESS ISSUE  </P> <P> "Promises to Keep" is advocacy documentary with a capital A. Producer-director  Ginny Durrin's film about activist Mitch Snyder's battle to create a model  shelter for the homeless in Washington, D.C., is a strong, one-sided affair,  near-religious in its moral surety.  </P> <P> "Promises," airing tonight at 9 on Channel 50 and at 10 on Channel 28, follows  Snyder and the Community for Creative Non-Violence as they battle the federal  bureaucracy to get funding for a decrepit shelter near the White House, a  battle that includes sit-ins, hunger strikes, election-year politicking and  playing the news media.  </P> <P> "Promises," which has been nominated for an Academy Award for best documentary  feature, is powerful and moving, particularly in its segments with the  homeless.  </P> <P> It is nonetheless weakened by an approach that offers little rebuttal from  federal officials. Perhaps Durrin thought that these officials have enough ammo  at their disposal, but it is a mistake to include only the more sleazy attacks  on Snyder -- for example, when a bureaucrat suggests that Snyder has almost a  Jim Jones cult-like hold on his fellow activists.  </P> <P> The show's "holy crusade" tone also detracts from the promise of "Promises."  </P> <P> Martin Sheen's narration borders on the self-righteous, as does the continual  use of gospel music and the invocation of God. Part of this can be laid at  Snyder's feet -- any man who has spent nearly two years fasting for causes  probably has the right to be holier-than-thou.  </P> <P> God and media smarts -- a one-two punch that couldn't be fended off even by an  Administration whose leader said "people . . . sleeping on the grates . . . are  homeless by choice."

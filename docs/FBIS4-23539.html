			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 8 SAPA -- Provincial premiers met in  Pretoria on Wednesday night for "confidential discussions" ahead  of their meeting on Thursday with government ministers to  discuss provincial executive powers. PWV [Pretoria,  Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] Premier Tokyo Sexwale said the  premiers would meet from time to time in different regional  capitals.    Only North-West Premier Popo Molefe, who is ill, was not  present. He was represented by Satish Roopa.    The premiers will meet Constitutional Development Minister  Roelf Meyer and Public Service and Administration Minister Zola  Skweyiya in Pretoria for further discussions on provincial  executive powers.    The meeting is a follow-up to a meeting in Cape Town last  month and follows the removal by proclamation last Friday of all  provincial powers. The powers were temporarily assigned to  central government departments in preparation for their being  devolved to the provinces.    The expectation is that most of the provincial premiers will  apply to be able to exercise all of the powers determined by the  constitution. While some of these powers can be exercised  exclusively, others can only be exercised subject to the  approval of the central government.    Mr Meyer said at a recent briefing he envisaged a process in  which the provinces negotiated for powers from central  government.    Apart from fulfilling constitutional provisions the  provinces  have to be able to demonstrate that their administrations will  be in a position to administer the exercise of powers. This is  especially difficult given that provincial administrations are  being amalgamated with former homeland and self-governing  territories' administrations. The process is far from complete.    In some cases a province might leave a function to the  central government even though constitutionally it is entitled  to administer that function on its own.</p>

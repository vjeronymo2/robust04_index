			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Court Overturns Warning by Mr. </F> Shumeyko to NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA"]    [Text] On 19 April 1994 the Tver Inter-Municipal (formerly  Sverdlovsk) People's Court in the City of Moscow (Judge  Baburina) tried a case stemming from a lawsuit brought by  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA against the Russian Federation Press  Committee, asking that the warning issued by the former Ministry  of the Press be declared illegal. The court found in favor of  the plaintiff in this lawsuit.    The essence of this case lay in the fact that on 2 December  1993 the Russian Federation Ministry of the Press and  Information sent an official warning--signed by V.F.  Shumeyko--to the editors of NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. This warning  asserted that, by publishing in the 30 November 1993 issue a  draft edict by the president of the Russian Federation on the  administrative-territorial unification of the city of Moscow and  Moscow Oblast, the editors had "used the mass media for the  purpose of committing a criminally punishable act," and that  "the information is false inasmuch as no such draft exists."    The warning was incorrect both in substance (the draft edict  did exist) and in form; the reference to Section 59, Part 2 and  Section 51 of the Russian Federation Law on the Mass Media had  no legal force inasmuch as these sections do not provide for  intervention by a ministry in the form of a warning. Nor did  NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA violate Section 4 of the Russian Federation  Law on the Mass Media, i.e., it did not "use the mass media for  the purpose of committing a criminally punishable act."    The court agreed with the plaintiff's arguments. The  decision  recognizing the illegality of the warning issued by the Ministry  of the Press took effect on 1 May 1994. The Press Committee did  not appeal it.    Attorney Raisa Tyurina defended NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA's  interests in this case.</p>

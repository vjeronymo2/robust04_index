			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Discussion between announcers Razi Barqay and Tamar Landau </F> and political correspondent Udi Segal in the Tel Aviv studio --  live]    [Text] [Landau] Hello political correspondent Udi Segal.    [Segal] Good afternoon.    [Landau] What was the reaction in Jerusalem?    [Segal] Officials in Jerusalem say that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] attack in Lebanon did not constitute a violation  of the understandings reached after Operation Accountability  since no civilian were hurt and the only casualties were among  Hizballah fighters.    [Landau] Although the attack was north of the security zone.    [Segal] Yes, but officials in Jerusalem said this  constituted no violation. Nevertheless, we have learned that  although not all the cabinet ministers supported this morning's  raid, Hizballah's counterfire with Katyusha rockets at Israeli  territory is unanimously regarded as a violation of the  agreement. This is not new. Hizballah has already violated the  agreement two or three times. Several political sources  nevertheless said that the situation was still better than the  one existing prior to Operation Accountability, which led to  last year's military operation along Israel's northern border.    [Landau] Do you know if the IDF is considering a  counterattack?    [Segal] Defense sources have said that the shelling proves  that we are actively engaged in a war against terrorism. This  results from political, strategic, military, and operational  considerations and any reaction by Hizballah is carefully  studied at the military and political levels before being  approved.    [Barqay] Mordekhay Gur earlier said that Hizballah's attack  constituted a flagrant violation of the agreements. Second, the  IDF's operation this morning is not viewed as a violation. Let  us now move on to political developments which continue  regardless of the exacerbation along Israel's northern border.  You have just learned that Shim'on Peres will make a stopover  in Rabat on his way back from South America.    [Segal] Yes, we just pulled in that report a short while  ago. Shim'on Peres is due to arrive in Rabat, the capital of  Morocco, this evening. This has been confirmed by political  sources in Jerusalem. Peres is scheduled to meet with King  Hassan in a bid to promote the opening of a joint interest and  liaison office in the Moroccan capital. This office will serve  as a kind of low-level diplomatic representation.    Negotiations between officials in Rabat and Jerusalem have  been conducted over the past few months. As we reported on IDF  Radio, a proposal that Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin himself fly  to Morocco was considered approximately one month ago. Foreign  Minister Peres was slated to fly to Morocco afterwards but  canceled his visit after the Moroccans expressed opposition.  The Moroccan Government has still not given Israel a green  light for the visit.    Over the past week, negotiations were conducted on several  levels by David Adon, the director of the Israel-Arab department  at the Foreign Ministry, who has spent the past few days in  Morocco. Labor Knesset Member Rafi Edri is also in the Moroccan  capital in an attempt to establish initial steps toward  normalization. There is no guarantee that Peres' visit will  induce the Moroccan king to support such a move but Foreign  Ministry officials are hopeful that some progress will be made.    A Foreign Ministry delegation, led by 'Oded 'Eran, the  assistant director general in charge of economics, will arrive  in Rabat on Sunday [5 June] in order to prepare the multilateral  talks due to begin in approximately two weeks. This delegation  will also hold political talks.    [Barqay] Thank you, Udi Segal.</p>

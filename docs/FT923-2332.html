			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / National pride stands in the way of Kuriles talks / A look at the row between Russia and Japan over disputed islands THE granting this week of a 50-year lease to a Hong Kong company to develop part of Shikotan, one of the remote Kurile islands off the Japanese coast, will do nothing to help resolve a territorial dispute which is poisoning relations between Russia and Japan. The row may escalate if reports are confirmed that an Austrian company might build a golf course on Kunishir, another of the islands. Both countries have much to lose by failure to settle a dispute that has become mainly a question of national pride and which led to the abrupt cancellation last week of a visit to Japan by President Boris Yeltsin. Russia has all but lost an opportunity for large-scale economic aid, which Japan has said it will only grant if it gets back the four islands it calls its Northern Territories. Japan's goal of climbing out of its shell to play a bigger role in world affairs looks impossible if it cannot overcome an obsessive dispute with a close neighbour. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said one positive result of the cancellation of talks was that both sides now had an incentive to think hard about how to break the deadlock. But after such brusque treatment, the Japanese are finding it difficult to conceal the hurt. A foreign ministry official complained of questions of 'national honour' and 'injustice done to the Japanese'. And Mr Michio Watanabe, the Japanese foreign minister, said of President Yeltsin: 'If his official remarks cannot be trusted, I don't know what can.' He was responding to Mr Yeltsin's statements that the visit had been called off because of Japanese inflexibility rather than the 'domestic problems' cited to Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister. In fact, President Yeltsin appeared to have caved in to nationalist pressure not to give back any territory. Although the Soviet Union took several pieces of territory from the Japanese in the closing days of the second world war, Tokyo has limited its demands to Iturup, Kunishir, Shikotan and Hobbemai. This is because despite several exchanges of territories this century, only these islands have always been part of Japan and only their fate has been left to be settled by a post-war agreement. In 1951, the San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed by Japan and the US but shunned by Stalin, stipulated that Japan renounced all claim on the 'Kuriles'. The Japanese say this never meant the Northern Territories but the 18 other islands forming the Kurile chain. But the really weighty argument in favour of Russia returning at least two of the islands is the joint declaration of 1956, where the two sides agreed that Russia would hand over Hobbemai (an uninhabited group of islets) and Shikotan on the signing of a peace treaty. The fate of the others was to be negotiated subsequently. But while Mr Yeltsin may be willing to reaffirm the 1956 agreement, the issue has been seized on by an unholy alliance of neo-communists and Russian nationalists who accused him of planning a sellout of national interests. Against this background, Japan's demands for Russian recognition of its sovereignty over all four islands - presented by Tokyo as a concession after initially seeking their immediate handover - were doomed from the start.</p>

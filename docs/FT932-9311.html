			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / Names win right to take action against agents LLOYD'S NAMES can take legal action against their agents even if they have not paid their insurance losses, a High Court judge ruled yesterday. Mr Justice Saville was ruling on a preliminary issue in proceedings brought by several thousand Names against their managing and members' agents at the insurance market. The agents had contested that 'pay now, sue later' clauses in the agreements signed with them by Names  - the individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's  - precluded those Names who were unable to meet their losses from pursuing legal action. In a 10-page written judgment Mr Justice Saville said that if the 'pay now, sue later' clause were applied in these cases it would 'deprive a Name with no funds of the only asset which could be utilised to pay the call, namely the value of his claim against his agent'. Mr Justice Saville also awarded immediate costs to the Names. Names' leaders yesterday welcomed the decision. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group who is named in the action, said: 'This is a very important victory in the fight to obtain compensation for Gooda Walker Names.' Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the Feltrim Names Association, described the ruling as 'a victory for common sense'. The agents may appeal, but the ruling clears the way for actions by several thousand Names to proceed. In the two biggest actions more than 2,000 Gooda Walker and Feltrim Names are arguing that negligence by their agents was responsible for insurance losses of more than Pounds 1bn. The Feltrim Names have filed for a summary judgment in their action in a case set to be heard in court in the autumn. Meanwhile, Mr Hook said he hoped that the ruling 'would act as a spur and an encouragement to those at Lloyd's trying to resolve the litigation'. Mr Deeny and Mr Hook are expected to meet Mr Peter Middleton, Lloyd's chief executive, on Monday to explore a possible out-of-court settlement of their actions. Feltrim and Gooda Walker syndicates were active in the market for catastrophe reinsurance at Lloyd's in the late 1980s.</p>

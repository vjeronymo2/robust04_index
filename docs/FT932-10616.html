			<p>930507 FT  07 MAY 93 / Survey of Canadian Forest Products (9): The McDonald's way - Profile / Abitibi-Price BETWEEN visits to customers and mills, a group of senior managers at Abitibi-Price has been calling on companies as far removed from the newsprint business as United Parcel Service, Hewlett-Packard and snack-food maker Frito-Lay. The Abitibi managers are hoping to learn some of the secrets which have made these companies among the best performing and most admired in North American business. Their task is to apply the lessons to the corporate culture and financial performance of their own company. Mr Ron Oberlander, Abitibi's chief executive, asserts that newsprint producers will need to look inwards to boost profits over the next few years, rather than rely on a surge in the marketplace. 'I don't see any return to glory days,' Mr Oberlander says. 'This is going to remain a very tough industry.' The over-riding question for every newsprint maker in the years ahead, he predicts, will be: 'Where are you in the cost curve?' As a result, he is trying to hammer home the message that maximising cash flow and containing costs are now the top priorities for Abitibi's 8,600 workers. Abitibi made a start in 1992 by cutting the net cost of its newsprint by CDollars 15 a tonne, and generating CDollars 175m in cash. In the first three months of 1993, the combined operating profit of its 11 mills showed the first quarterly year-on-year increase in five years. Mr John Duncanson, forestry analyst at Sanwa McCarthy in Toronto, predicts that Abitibi will be modestly profitable in 1993 after three consecutive years of losses totalling CDollars 345m. 'I think they've got their act together on the management side. 'But they still have a couple of hurdles to go,' he says. Mr John Johnson, analyst at Richardson Greenshields, forecasts a return to profitability only in 1994. One uncertainty still hanging over Abitibi is its ownership. Olympia &amp; York, the crippled real estate developer, nominally has an 82 per cent stake. But under O&amp;Y's debt restructuring, the shares are now controlled by a consortium of international banks to which they were pledged as collateral for a USDollars 2.5bn loan. The banks are weighing their options. These include seeking a new controlling shareholder, selling their shares in a public offering or hanging on to them in the hope that the business recovery will increase Abitibi's market value. If Mr Oberlander has his way, Abitibi's new shareholders will find a vastly different company from the one left behind by O&amp;Y. Abitibi has turned its back on an ambitious but costly diversification drive in the 1970s and 1980s to concentrate on its core business of groundwood papers, especially newsprint. The company noted in its latest annual report: 'Frankly, it was always our core business that delivered the highest earnings.' Abitibi has sold, or is in the process of selling, several other businesses, including its building products division, paper distributors and a coated papers company. It is also in the throes of reorganising the assets that remain. Three business teams have been set up to deal with North American publishers, commercial printers and international customers. Each of the 11 paper mills is allocated to one of the divisions. The most far-reaching changes however, are taking place at the mills themselves. A recent study estimated that the company could have saved an extra CDollars 45m in 1992 if each mill's performance during its best three months could be sustained throughout the year. Mr Oberlander, a Montrealer whose roots in the forestry industry go back to his father's fibreboard mill, harps on the lessons which Abitibi can learn from successful companies in other industries. If McDonald's can produce consistently good French fries, Abitibi should be able to do the same with groundwood papers, he insists. 'There's a McDonald's way; there's got to be an Abitibi-Price way.' The drive for consistently good products at low cost has begun not at Abitibi's worst plant, but at its best, the Augusta mill in Georgia, which is a joint venture with Thomson Corporation, the publishing and travel group. A team has been set up at Augusta under the regional manager and mill manager with instructions to improve the mill's cash flow. Augusta now has its own sales force and is taking over functions, such as invoicing and the general ledger, previously handled by head office. Preventive maintenance is getting more attention. No matter how successful these efforts are, however, the extent and speed of any commodity producer's recovery inevitably remain tied to border market conditions over which it has little control. Here the picture is mixed. 'Everything is tender,' Mr Oberlander says. 'We've been down so long that it's hard to believe up is possible.' North American consumption for groundwood papers now appears to be on a steady, through gradual, uptrend. But demand in Europe - especially the UK and Germany - is still sagging. Abitibi's sales in offshore markets slumped from CDollars 227m in 1991 - equal to 14 per cent of total revenues - to CDollars 191m last year. The company, which has a total capacity of almost 2m tonnes of newsprint and 460,000 tonnes of uncoated groundwood papers, a year, took another 20,000 tonnes out of production in April 1993, with the warning that 'further downtime will be required in 1993 should present market conditions prevail.'</p>

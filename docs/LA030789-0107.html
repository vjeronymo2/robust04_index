			<p><P> March 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LOTTO WINNER JUST NEVER GAVE UP  </P> <P> Patience, steady betting and dreaming of "the big one" paid off for Jose Amador  Granados of Anaheim over the weekend.  </P> <P> Granados, a Mexican national who has lived in California for 14 years, was one  of the four winners of the $44.9-million California Lotto 6-49 jackpot.  </P> <P> He is expected to clear about $448,000 annually for the next 20 years after the  federal government takes out 20% in taxes, state lottery officials said Monday.  </P> <P> An avid lottery player, Granados said he has spent at least $30 a week on  tickets since the lottery began 3 years ago.  </P> <P> "Every time I go to buy something, I buy a ticket," he said. He estimated that  he has spent more than $3,000 on tickets altogether.  </P> <P> "I was trying and trying," he said during an interview Monday at the Laguna  Hills landscaping company where he is a supervisor.  </P> <P> "I never had this much money before."  </P> <P> No probability theory or birthdates played roles in Granados' number selection,  which he left to chance. The "pick six" computer chose his winning combination  of 16-26-27-36-43-45.  </P> <P> Granados, 30, said he had trouble sleeping Sunday night because of the  excitement. "I feel good, but at the same time I feel different."  </P> <P> Still, he insisted, riches will not change him.  </P> <P> "I'm still the same person; my personality is going to be the same," he said,  "I don't like to change."  </P> <P> Granados said he will keep his job.  </P> <P> Ken Lawson, owner of Lawson Landscaping Maintenance where Granados has worked  for 6 years, said he wasn't too happy about Granados' good fortune.  </P> <P> "I wasn't thrilled he won, actually, because I didn't want him to quit," Lawson  said, only half joking. Managers described Granados as a hard worker -- he  works 6 days a week -- and a good employee who had worked his way up to  supervise several crews totaling about 35 men.  </P> <P> With about a dozen gold chains draped about his neck and showy gold rings that  he wears on both hands every day, Granados sported a bit of a nouveau riche  look Monday. But he said his first purchase from the lottery check, which he  expects in 3 weeks, will be a practical one -- a home for his parents who live  alternately in Tijuana and California. Then, he said, he will buy a new car for  himself.  </P> <P> Asked how he will handle people who are expected to ask him for donations,  Granados replied that he likes to help poor people.  </P> <P> "I am of poor people; we came from Mexico," he explained. "When I have  something, I like to help the poor people."  </P> <P> The winning ticket was purchased at an Albertson's on Campus Drive in Irvine,  which lottery officials said will get about $56,000, or 0.05%, as its share of  the winnings.  </P> <P> The three others winners were James Hickey of La Puente, James Hurley of  Hayward and Charles Johnson of San Francisco.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP 5 COUNTY LOTTO WINNERS  </P> <P> $20,660,000 -- Ron Smith, Westminster, Oct. 29, 1988.  </P> <P> $19,580,000 -- Christene Lentz, Capistrano Beach, Aug. 24, 1988  </P> <P> $14,332,143 -- Zafer Altintas, Irvine, Nov. 23, 1988  </P> <P> $10,975,000 -- Jose Amador Granados, Anaheim, March 4, 1989  </P> <P> $10,080,000 -- Herbans Grewal, Anaheim, May 18, 1988  </P> <P> Source: California State Lottery  </P> <P> </P></p>

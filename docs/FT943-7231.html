			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / International Company News: Instrumentarium buys Gambro medical unit Instrumentarium, the Finnish health care group, has agreed to buy the intensive care and anaesthesia business of Gambro, the Swedish medical equipment specialist. The deal, on undisclosed terms, will give Instrumentarium a business with 360 employees in 15 countries and annual sales of SKr450m (Dollars 58.4m). Its main units are in Germany, the UK, Italy and Sweden. The purchase will strengthen the Finnish group's Datex division, a world leader in patient monitoring equipment. Intensive care and anaesthesia was the only Gambro division to report reduced sales when the Swedish group announced its first-half figures last week. Health-sector investment restraints were blamed. Seco Tools, the Swedish industrial tool maker, yesterday reported a 76 per cent jump in pre-tax profit for the first six months of 1994, AP-DJ reports. The company predicted a better full-year result for 1994 compared with 1993. Seco's pre-tax profits advanced to SKr216m from SKr123m on sales which rose to SKr1.07bn, compared with SKr955m last time.</p>

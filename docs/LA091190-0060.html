			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> PALMDALE OKS $2 MILLION FOR RECREATION CENTER  </P> <P> Palmdale officials said Monday that they hope to open a long-delayed indoor  recreation center by the end of the year, financing the project with $2 million  from city redevelopment funds.  </P> <P> The city plans to renovate a former toy store and turn it into a youth-oriented  center that would include a full basketball court, two smaller basketball  courts and areas for aerobics, exercise and studying, according to a city staff  report.  </P> <P> Sitting as directors of the city's redevelopment agency, Palmdale City Council  members agreed Friday to buy the 32,000-square-foot building from Van Nuys  businessman Alex Kaminar for $1.7 million. They also agreed to spend $300,000  on remodeling.  </P> <P> Parents, teen-agers and others in the Antelope Valley city have complained that  Palmdale, despite its tremendous growth, has no indoor recreation facilities  where youngsters can play sports or just socialize in a supervised setting.  </P> <P> The city had negotiated for months to arrange a 10-year lease of the building,  but last month switched to an offer to buy. Kaminar said he accepted because he  feared that the city might otherwise try to acquire the property through  condemnation.  </P> <P> The new center will be in the heart of downtown Palmdale, at 815 E. Avenue Q-6.  The building had been a supermarket for years and more recently was a toy store  until it closed earlier this year.  </P> <P> The stalled lease negotiations put the center months behind schedule. It would  have been paid for with city general funds. The money became available this  summer when the city decided to scale down plans for a performing arts center.  </P></p>

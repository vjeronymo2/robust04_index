			<p>BFN     [Text] United Nations, April 26 (AFP) -- The United Nations  will not hesitate in calling air strikes if Bosnian Serbs do not  remove all heavy artillery within 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) of  Gorazde, U.N. Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali said Tuesday  in Barbados. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has  threatened to bomb Serb positions if the equipment is not  withdrawn from around the Moslem enclave by 0001 GMT Wednesday.  "If they don't withdraw, then we will use air strikes against  them without any hesitation," he said in a press conference in  Barbados broadcast at the United Nations.    NATO and the United Nations have several times threatened  air  raids to protect Bosnian Moslems in UN-declared safe areas but  never actually carried them out except for two strikes two weeks  ago to protect UN peacekeepers.    "I am hoping that the Serbs will comply with the different  resolutions which have been adopted by the UN and that they will  leave Gorazde and that we will not be compelled to use air  strikes," he said.    UN forces in the former Yugoslavia have said that the heavy  weapons are being withdrawn as the deadline approaches.    The secretary general has been in the Caribbean island of  Barbados since the weekend to open a world conference for  sustainable development for small states.</p>

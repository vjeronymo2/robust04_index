			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by 'Ali Nun: "Senior Syrian Official Tells AL-HAYAH: </F> `We See No Solution With Israel Under Any Kind of Pressure'"]    [Text] Damascus -- A senior Syrian official expects U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher to return to the region in  August. He emphasized that Syria "did not ask Christopher not  to come to the region" and that it was Israeli Prime Minister  Yitzhaq Rabin who did that.    The same official told AL-HAYAH that "there is not a single  Syrian who would accept, would be able, or would be authorized  to forfeit even a single grain of the homeland's soil.  President Hafiz al-Asad said that, and it applies to all times,  conditions, and circumstances."    He reaffirmed that "there is a big gap between the positions  of Syria and Israel" and that last time Secretary Christopher  came to Damascus he did not bring "a satisfactory Israeli reply"  to Syria. He emphasized that "no power on earth can force Syria  to accept what it does not want.... We take a long view and we  known that a conflict like the Arab-Israeli conflict cannot be  settled justly and comprehensively under the pressure of any  time element or any other element."    The same source said that "the right thing in the peace  process on the Syrian track would be for Israel to accept the  essence of the peace process, namely land for peace -- the  occupied territory in return for Arab peace for Israel. When  Christopher last came to Damascus it was clear that Israel  wanted to discuss details and secondary issues before beginning  to lay down the foundations of peace on the basis of the  principles agreed between the United States and the parties to  the peace process. If the occupied territory -- all the  territory occupied during the 1967 aggression -- is not  returned, there can be no real and true initiation of the  establishment of peace in the region or on the Syrian-Israeli  track."    He said that "Israel did not give the United States its  acceptance of the land-for-peace principle but played around  with phrases and words to mislead world public opinion. Rabin  spoke of withdrawal from the Golan and he also spoke  demonstratively saying that he would opt for the dismantling of  the settlements in the Golan if he had to choose between peace  with Syria or the settlements in the Golan. It was clear that  Rabin was working more for misinformation than for real peace in  the region."    In reply to a question, he said that what Syria "wanted and  still wants is a just and comprehensive peace in the region  based and founded on the principles of international legitimacy  and the UN resolutions. There is nothing in these principles  and resolutions that gives the condemned aggressor Israel the  right to keep even one single inch of the Arab territories  occupied in the 1967 aggression. That is why Syria told  Christopher and world public opinion that there was a big gap  between the positions of Syria and Israel. Syria really and  seriously wants to proceed toward the establishment of a just  and comprehensive peace but Israel, through verbal and  diplomatic games, wants to fulfill its aims and ambitions in the  region, something it could not fulfill through its numerous wars  and aggressions."    The senior Syrian official added that, in Syria's view, "the  letter A of the alphabet which must be uttered before the rest  of the letters of the peace alphabet can be pronounced is a  declaration of Israel's agreement to fully withdraw from all the  territories it occupied during the 1967 aggression, in  implementation of the UN resolutions and the peace process  principles. When Israel pledges full withdrawal, and in so  doing opens the way for the fulfillment of the aim of the peace  process, we can then move on to the question of security  arrangements and then to the rest of the relevant issues to  establish a full peace between Syria and Israel."    He said that President al-Asad had declared at his joint  press conference with President Bill Clinton in Geneva that  Syria "is prepared to sign an agreement with Israel if it  accepts the equation of full peace in return for full  withdrawal. Syria cannot put the cart before the horse and  engage in discussions about peace and details of peace relations  before the cornerstone is laid down for ending the state of war  which has existed between Syria and Israel since 1948. The  horse must come before the cart, and that horse is full  withdrawal from all the territories occupied in 1967."    In reply to a question, he pointed out that "Syria has  cooperated with the United States in the peace process since the  letter sent by President al-Asad to former U.S. President Geroge  Bush accepting the U.S. initiative which launched the peace  process on the basis agreed by the United States and the rest of  the parties concerned with the target set for that process,  namely just and comprehensive peace. Damascus had repeatedly  received former Secretary of State James Baker and also received  Secretary Christopher, and never said that it would reject a  U.S. secretary of state's visit or that it was severing contacts  with Washington. What Syria wants is a peace process based on  the principles agreed upon for that process leading also to the  target set for that process."    In reply to another question, he said that "to this moment  and to this day, Washington has not said that it has abandoned  the principles agreed upon for the peace process nor the set  target which is just and comprehensive peace. U.S. President  Clinton has reaffirmed his adherence to the peace process and  the basis and objective agreed upon. There has been nothing  from the American side to indicate that it wishes to abandon  that position. When Washington announced that it would play the  role of full partner, that meant that it felt the process, which  Israel was delaying, required more efforts in order to proceed  and continue."</p>

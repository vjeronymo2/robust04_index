			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Merrydown declines by 11% as competition bites STIFFER competition in the premium cider market contributed to an 11 per cent decline in full-year pre-tax profits at Merrydown, the Sussex-based cidermaker. Though total cider volumes more than matched the overall market growth of 12 per cent, profits for the year to March 31 slipped from Pounds 1.93m to Pounds 1.71m. The shares fell 16p to 268p. Trading profit was virtually unchanged at Pounds 2.33m on turnover ahead 11 per cent at Pounds 19.2m. Merrydown Vintage Cider maintained its brand leadership in the premium take-home market with a 27 per cent share but faced severe pressure on pricing and margins from the launch of rival branded and private label ciders. 'It is very doubtful whether the market can sustain all the new high alcohol cider brands that have been launched,' said Mr Richard Purdey, chairman. Merrydown's volume and prices were also affected by the impact of recession on independent retailers in south-east England. However, sales of Traditional Cider in cans continued to grow strongly and the group entered the private label business which, Mr Purdey said, was starting to make a 'useful contribution' to profits. Export sales advanced some 19 per cent to Pounds 900,000. Recession, particularly in Germany, slowed progress in Europe but new business in South America made a promising start. Overseas profit contribution, however, remained minimal while high costs of opening new markets are being incurred. Interest charges rose from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 621,000 as the company invested heavily in relaunching its Vintage Ciderbrand and improving production and bottling facilities. Borrowings at the year end were Pounds 5.26m against shareholders' funds of Pounds 13.8m. Earnings per share fell from 15.24p to 13.03p but a final dividend of 6p lifts the total by 12.5 per cent to 7p. COMMENT Merrydown, the pioneer of the premium cider market, is finding it tough defending its ground against the rush of later, and bigger, entrants. But it is difficult to fault its strategy for combating competition. Management has been restructured and strengthened; it has invested heavily in relaunching its leading cider brand and in production and bottling facilities that have enabled it to enter the growing private label business; it has expanded into the pub market for draught cider through an agreement with Gaymer Group and has reduced its dependence on cider by acquiring adult soft drink brands such as Piermont, Shloer and PLJ. Their contribution should enable Merrydown this year to double pre-tax profits to Pounds 3.5m as the growth in cider slows to an estimated 5 per cent. On a prospective p/e of 12.5 it looks reasonably rated below Bulmer and Taunton.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Technology: An early warning can save the day - Worth Watching Early warning of jet engine damage or failure could help improve air safety and perhaps save the lives of aircraft or helicopter passengers. Smiths Industries is developing a gas turbine electrostatic engine monitoring system which will provide pilots or ground crews with up to 100 hours' warning of engine problems. The system, initially developed by United Technologies' Sikorsky Aircraft Division and then licensed to Smiths Industries' US aerospace subsidiary, detects clouds of charged particles caused by abnormal engine conditions in the exhaust gas stream. A complementary warning system, particularly useful in helicopters, uses a radio frequency coil to detect small metallic particles in fluids or in the hydraulic system. Warnings of up to 10 hours of impending transmission failure can be achieved. Smiths Industries: US, 201 822 1300; UK, 081 458 3232.</p>

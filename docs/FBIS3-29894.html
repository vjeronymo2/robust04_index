He enjoyed strong backing at home and abroad as the  country's first civilian leader in over three decades, but was  plagued by events such as the Uruguay Round [UR] and North  Korean nuclear issue over which he had little control.    Kim started his foreign policy with a loud bang. "New  diplomacy," he called it, essentially asking his country to look  beyond to the regional and international communities, to  consider trade diplomacy and not just political affairs. Hardly  stirring from home, Kim received heads of state from 11  countries during the year including France, Germany, Singapore,  the Philippines, India and Australia.    Summits included two highly strategic meetings with U.S.  President Bill Clinton and weekend talks with Japanese Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa outside the capital city.    Certain events coincidentally helped Kim. The first-ever  summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) opened up  a new regional horizon and gave Seoul a role in linking two  separated continents.    The timely emergence of a member of the post-war generation,  Prime Minister Hosokawa, helped in clearing up Korea and Japan's  unhappy past at a weekend summit last November. The new  Japanese leader enumerated his country's crimes during the  35-year colonial rule early this century as none of his  predecessors had ever done. While touching bases with South  Korea's traditional allies, Kim kept alive ties with China,  meeting President Jiang Zemin during the APEC summit.    Seoul-Beijing ties have steadily grown strong over the past  year to the point where the two sides agreed to exchange  military attaches, a symbolic event considering China's staunch  alliance with South Korea's rival, North Korea. At the same  time, Kim mended relations broken by his predecessor by  establishing non-official links with Taipei through the exchange  of missions. But when it came to major diplomatic items, Kim  was not so lucky.    The conclusion of the Uruguay Round fell into his lap.  Keeping South Korea's rice market closed had been one of Kim's  presidential campaign pledges, but he was forced to break the  promise at the last minute: Seoul bowed to the principle of  tariffication without exception, including its agricultural  market.    Negotiators managed to earn a 10-year grace period before  opening the market to rice imports, but side effects from the UR  hailstorm remain to this day with farmers and students taking to  the streets.    His agriculture minister, Ho Sin-haeng, was made a scapegoat  and fired immediately after returning from the UR negotiations.  But the real misfortune came in the form of the North Korean  nuclear dispute.    Barely one month in office, Kim's administration was hit by  Pyongyang's thunderous announcement of its withdrawal from the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT).    The majority of Kim's foreign policy since then has been  geared toward getting North Korea to allow international nuclear  inspections.    Roughly one year after the bombshell announcement, the  nuclear situation has returned to where it was last March, but  only after a series of resolutions by the international  community and sanctions threats by the U.N. Security Council.    Like the silver lining to a cloud, North Korea said last  week  that it would allow inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) to resume at a scope and scale demanded by  the U.N. nuclear watchdog.    Kim's diplomacy had to incline heavier toward the United  States because of the nuclear problem, especially since North  Korea demanded negotiations with, and only with, Washington.    Despite outward claims that the two countries were in unison  on how to handle the problem, the reality sometimes saw an  imbalance between hard-line and progressive stands.    The latest crack came over stationing Patriot missiles in  South Korea. U.S. chief commander in South Korea Gary Luck  asked for the Patriot deployment and the Clinton Administration  virtually approved it.    But South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu convinced  them  otherwise, advising delay at least while North Korea starts  talking with the IAEA.    Kim's government experienced smooth sailing in regional and  international diplomacy during the past year. He begins 1994  with state visits to Japan and China and will likely go to  Russia to round out a tour of superpower neighbors.    During the visits, the president will not only discuss  bilateral political and economic relations but close  coordination on the North Korean nuclear situation. But  contrary to Kim's progress in diplomacy at the regional and  international levels, ironically enough, inter-Korean diplomacy  turned out to be a wild goose chase.    The president bears no greater burden entering his second  year in office. Inter-Korean talks will most likely resume  since they are a precondition to improving North Korea-U.S.  relations. But exactly how the talks proceed and whether the  substance is satisfactory are entirely different matters.</p>

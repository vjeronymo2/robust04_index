			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: S African riots push up platinum - Week in the Markets CIVIL DISTURBANCES in South Africa following the killing of black leader Chris Hani produced strong reverberations in the platinum market this week. South Africa accounts for about two-thirds of western world platinum supplies so the market is particularly sensitive to the prospect of escalating unrest in that country. An erratic rise saw the New York Mercantile Exchange's July futures position touch Dollars 374 a troy ounce at one point, the highest since December, but in late trading yesterday it was quoted at Dollars 371.90 an ounce, up Dollars 13.10 on the week. Analysts say Dollars 373.50 an ounce remains a strong resistance level and that a break above Dollars 375 is needed to trigger a sharp rise. Dealers will be watching Mr Hani's funeral on Monday for indications as to whether tensions in South Africa are likely to intensify or relax in the near future. At the London Metal Exchange sentiment was dominated by the continued slide in copper prices to fresh 5 1/2 -year lows. Following the heavy pre-Easter fall a recovery was attempted on Tuesday. But that proved short-lived and by Thursday's close the psychologically-important Dollars 2,000-a-tonne level had been breached. Overnight selling in the Far East set the tone for yesterday's opening and stop-loss and options-related selling quickly pushed the three months delivery price to Dollars 1,877 a tonne. By the close the price had recovered to Dollars 1,903 a tonne, but that was still Dollars 113 down on the week. Mr William Adams of LME trader Rudolf Wolff said yesterday that the copper market was very over-sold but suggested that the price was likely to remain volatile because of options-related activity. The latest falls, which took losses over the past ten days to Dollars 270 a tonne, or 12.5 per cent, seemed to have been partly influenced by panic selling, he said. 'Copper hasn't been down here since October 87. . . it is running off the charts.' The price was now close to break-even level for some of the higher cost producers, Mr Adams pointed out. But he did not expect to see production cuts yet as 'people are still making profits'. Producers would not begin to scale down output until the market price was well below costs, Mr Adams said, 'and producers have to believe that it is going to stay there'. Copper's weakness affected sentiment in the other LME contracts. Nickel was particularly weak with the three months price slipping Dollars 235 to a 10-week low of Dollars 5,840 a tonne at one point after the breaching of the Dollars 6,000-a-tonne support level triggered the operation of stop-loss selling orders and commission house and merchant selling. The price rallied yesterday, however, and broke through resistance at Dollars 5,900 a tonne to close at Dollars 5,397.50 a tonne, up Dollars 90 on the day and Dollars 137.50 down on the week. The zinc market began the week in a relatively buoyant mood as chart-based resistance around Dollars 1,030 a tonne for three months metal was overcome and investment fund short-covering was triggered. There was also talk of production cuts in Pacific Rim countries, though this remained unconfirmed. Overhead resistance appeared at Dollars 1,050 a tonne, however, and disappointment at the modest scale of Chinese production cuts helped to push prices lower. The three months zinc price closed yesterday at Dollars 1,025.75 a tonne, down Dollars 3 on the day and up a mere Dollars 7.75 on the week. At the London Futures and Options Exchange robusta coffee prices regained some more of their lost ground but once again ran into resistance as the Dollars 900-a-tonne level for the July contract was approached. The price reached Dollars 885 a tonne on Thursday but slipped back yesterday to Dollars 876, up Dollars 27 on the week. Dealers were encouraged, nevertheless, by signs that the coffee market was building a solid base and suggested that the break-out from the present range, when it came, was likely to be on the up-side. The collapse at the end of last month of attempts to renegotiate a price-supporting International Coffee Agreement seems to have done the market little harm. In fact it may have helped sentiment by removing any lingering uncertainty about the prospects for a new pact. Producing countries are not yet ready to abandon all hope, however. Officials of the Inter-African Coffee Organisation told the Reuter news agency yesterday that ministers from Africa's 10 main coffee nations, including Ivory Coast, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and Zaire, were expected to attend a meeting in the Ivory Coast on April 26-27 to consider their next step after the failure of the pact talks. Mr Guy-Alain Gauze, the Ivorian commodities minister and the current IACO chairman, said last week that African countries wanted to try to revive the negotiations in a desperate bid to force up languishing world prices which have crippled poor producers. He explained that the Abidjan meeting would examine new proposals to be put to a session of the International Coffee Organisation's 16-member executive board in London on April 28-30. Sugar prices continued their retreat from recent highs this week but analysts were suggesting after a modest bounce yesterday that the 'rout' might be over. The July futures position in New York was quoted at 11.12 cents a lb, up 0.12 on the day but down 0.36 on the week.  ------------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS       (As at Thursday's close)  ------------------------------------ tonnes  ------------------------------------ Aluminium   -6,400 to  1,756,825 Copper      +2,350 to    369,600 Lead          +400 to    247,975 Nickel        +288 to     88,686 Zinc        +5,150 to    609,350 Tin         unchgd at     19,650  ------------------------------------</p>

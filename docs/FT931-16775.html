			<p>930105 FT  05 JAN 93 / Profit by power to the middle manager: How companies are enhancing the functions of supervisors MRS Sharon Roy, a supervisor at Buckingham Foods, where 1m snacks pour off the production lines every year, used to think of herself as a line leader who made sandwiches. 'I never thought about profit,' she says. She does now, and enjoys her job a lot more. In management jargon, she has been 'empowered', which means she is no longer an overseer but rather plays an active role in managing both the shop floor and the production process. Identified by many think tanks as one of the weak links in British industry, supervisory training - or the lack of it - has been an important management issue in the past year. Mrs Roy's experience is an example of what can happen in a reasonably enlightened company. 'I'd describe myself as a middle manager,' she says. 'I make my own decisions about how I achieve the production targets and I am responsible for quality control. Before, I used to come in and pick up a sheet which said how many sandwiches we had to produce and what variety. 'I had no influence on the number of staff required on a line, any input into how long processes should take, or any direct control over the machinery. Things have changed. If the line breaks down now, I don't just report it to my superior, like I used to do. Rather, I have the authority to get hold of the engineer to get the work done. I have production targets and I want to meet them.' Her change in status is reflected in the fact that she and the other 17 supervisors in a plant employing about 500 full-time workers have moved to monthly salaries, which incorporate overtime. She attends regular off-the-job training sessions. Mr Tony Prichard, the factory manager, says: 'These not only enhance individuals' skills but send very clear signals to the workforce that supervisors are important.' Buckingham, a subsidiary of Booker, the food group, operates in a highly labour-intensive business. It realised that supervisors were a key group of workers whose role had to be addressed if other shop-floor reforms - including more up-to-date information systems - were to succeed. It is an insight that a comparatively small, but growing, number of British companies is coming to share, including British Rail, BP Oil, Dunlop, Fisons and foreign-owned companies including Nissan, the carmaker. A measure of how fast they are putting their perceptions into practice was provided last year with the publication by the Management Charter Initiative, a government-backed body that seeks to improve management training, of national standards to assess and improve the quality of supervisors. The standards, linked to the new national vocational qualifications - attainment of which the government hopes will raise skill levels in the UK - cover four main management areas: finance, information, people and operations. Not all standards are applicable to all supervisors because of the diversity of roles they play in different industries. Inadequate supervisory skills have been part of the productivity problem of British industry for many years. Supervisors, like much of the workforce, have suffered from a lack of adequate training. The UK's 1.2m supervisors are a disparate group - ranging from line leaders in a Belfast missile factory to British Rail station managers. Few organisations have had a clear idea of what supervisors do, let alone what they should do. In many traditional UK companies they have been neither members of management nor part of the workforce - 'piggy-in-the-middle' is how they can best be described. That came about in an ad hoc manner - traditional supervisory activities such as production scheduling, quality control and employee training were withdrawn from supervisors under the influence of 'scientific' management. That required all jobs to be broken down into their simplest elements, with each worker performing only one set of actions. In recent years the 'human relations' school of management has emphasised the importance of the supervisor in motivating the work group. But the rise of the specialist personnel department also resulted in a reduced role for the supervisor in recruitment and industrial relations. The increasing sophistication of manufacturing also reduced the supervisor's technical discretion. The result, says a recent report from the National Economic Development Council, has been that the 'resulting supervisory function has been a residual one'. Yet supervisors have stubbornly maintained their presence on shop floors, in spite of moves in some companies to abolish the role, as at Birds Eye, the food company. However, organisations such the Confederation of British Industry argue that if Britain is to undergo a skills rev-olution, the supervisor needs to take the centre stage. A recent CBI report spelt out the task: 'The potential among middle managers and supervisors exists but is not being harnessed. It is a resource which is currently being ignored, under-utilised and demotivated. We need trained, skilled supervisors whose role is clear, whose contribution is valued and whose motivation is assured.' The CBI draws on a study of engineering and textile plants in Britain, France and Germany between 1988 and 1990 to press home its message. The study, by the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, found significant differences between Britain, France and Germany in the range of functions undertaken by supervisors. In Germany, line supervisors were aware of their section's production costs and received production schedules well in advance for forward planning. In Britain, supervisors frequently faced 'crisis management', chasing supplies, rescheduling because of breakdowns and training new staff because of high turnover. French supervisors were also under strain because of anxieties that their craft training was inadequate to cope with production demands influenced by new technology. Only in Germany did a large pool of skilled workers created by the apprenticeship system ensure that almost all supervisors were qualified at least to craft level and above. Research from the former National Economic Development Council reinforces that view. The proportion of German supervisors working in manufacturing industries with qualifications in 1991 was nearly double that of the UK. That was reflected in pay - with a much greater pay differential between craft workers and supervisors in Germany. Many of the issues thrown up by comparative work on supervisors is relevant to the wider training field. UK employers, are for example, not yet convinced of the need to enhance pay in recognition of the acquisition of skills, or that training pays. Companies such as Nissan, which pays its supervisors salary levels equal to those of professional engineers and other equivalent positions, are rare. Buckingham Foods, which is comparatively fresh to the world of training, is becoming a convert. It says improvements at its plant - identified and implemented with the help of Peter Chadwick, the management consultants - have generated savings of about Pounds 800,000 in the past year. Mr Peter Halman, managing director, says changes to the supervisory roles were not the only ingredients of the improvement to the bottom line, but they were significant. Buckingham spent Pounds 35,000 on off-the-job training in the past year. That compares with nothing four years ago, and Mr Halman believes the amount will continue to increase. As in much of British industry, the approach is softly, softly. Mr Halman has not offered his supervisors the new supervisory qualifications. Indeed, he had not heard of them. 'That may be for the future,' he says.</p>

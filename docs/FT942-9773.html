			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / International Company News: Daiwa House pre-tax profits fall 13.7% Daiwa House, one of Japan's biggest housing construction companies, yesterday posted pre-tax profits down 13.7 per cent to Y75bn (Dollars 721.2m) from Y87.1bn for the year to March. The results, the first set to be published by a Japanese construction company for the last financial year, significantly undershot analysts' forecasts. The profits fall was in spite of recent strong growth in housing starts. The group declined to explain the profits shortfall, which was about 5 per cent below expectations. However, Mr Takashi Hashimoto, construction analyst at CS First Boston in Japan, said Daiwa House, normally viewed as a house building company, was also exposed to the general construction market which has been badly affected by Japan's longest and deepest post-war recession. About 40 per cent of the group's turnover was in this sector, he explained. 'The downturn in general construction offset any benefits from the upturn in housing starts,' he said. 'However, groups such as Sekisui House, National House and Sumitomo Forestry are less exposed to general construction than Daiwa House.' The group's turnover rose 1 per cent to Y935bn from Y926bn. Post-tax profits fell 9.6 per cent to Y40.5bn from Y44.8bn, or from the per-share equivalent to Y84.63 from Y93.69. The group said it would maintain its dividend of Y17 per share for the current financial year. Daiwa House predicted modest increases in profits and sales growth for the current year. Pre-tax profits should reach Y85bn, and post-tax profits Y45bn, equivalent to Y94.02 a share. Turnover should be Y1,000bn, it forecast. Mr Hashimoto warned the predictions were highly optimistic. Daiwa's shares fell Y10 to Y1530 in a rising market yesterday. Sekisui House's shares fell Y30 to Y1290.</p>

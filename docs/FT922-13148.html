			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Arts: Today's Television For years the mass media have sucked up to yoof, not because the young are more interesting than the old or have more money (generally they have less) but because there are so many immature people in the advertising industry, obsessed by yoof interests. Ads bring in the mazoola, so the advertising people have dragged journalists along behind them and the result has been the mindless rap culture of yoof which now surrounds us and bores us to tears. But change is in the air. 'The Oldie' magazine is proving a success, and today's 40 Minutes is about five couples, all over 65, who met and fell in love (9.50 BBC2). Earlier, Soul explores what seems to be a growing tendency for modern science to encroach upon religion: studies of cosmology, evolution and the human brain all seem to be edging into territory previously occupied by the chaps with their collars on backwards (7.40 BBC2). C4's increasingly impressive arts magazine, Without Walls first contributes to the yoof craze with a tribute to Radio 1 on its 25th birthday, then screens the last of Robert McKee's excellent lectures on film-making, concentrating today on Ingmar Bergman.</p>

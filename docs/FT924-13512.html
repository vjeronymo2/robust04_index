			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Some contest Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has thrown down the gauntlet on subsidiarity. Vexed by MEPs' calls for an off-the-cuff explanation of Brussels' position on the ill-defined principle that EC decisions should be taken at the lowest appropriate level, Delors told yesterday's special session of the European Parliament that a concise summary was impossible. What was more, he said, the Commission would be happy to offer employment and a Ecu 200,000 salary to anyone who could produce a one-page explanation of how subsidiarity might work. The 'secret' subsidiarity paper produced by Delors' own aides runs to 23 pages. One MEP who has already risen to Delors' tongue-in-cheek challenge is British Conservative Edward McMillan-Scott. He has already produced a summary of the Maastricht treaty changes on two sides of a postcard - with room to spare for his photograph - and was last night trying to reduce it to competition size. Delors has not suggested who might be the judge of such a contest; if he were inundated with entries, perhaps the concept of subsidiarity might be brought into play.</p>

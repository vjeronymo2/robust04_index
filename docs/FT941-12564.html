			<p>940129 FT  29 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste not simple problem Sir, Ms Georgina Watkins-Spies (Letters, January 27) advocates that Europe's legislators force manufacturers to use less packaging, or more of the reusable kind. This really is a very simplistic approach to a very complicated problem, and it is worth quoting a letter from the German Coffee Association to the German environment minister which was included in the House of Lords European Communities Committee report on packaging and packaging waste published on October 19 1993. The letter describes the effects of replacing the composite aluminium and plastic lightweight film packing of roast coffee in Germany by packaging in either tin-plate or glass. The present 11,000 tonnes of film would have to be replaced by 120,000 tonnes of tin-plate, or 470,000 tonnes of glass. The result would be to create more residual waste and require three times as many lorries to transport and collect the materials. This clearly is not sensible, and indeed in a related point, the 80 per cent of plastics sorted in Germany is described as 'sheer madness' by the Duales System Deutschland manager, Wolfram Bruck, also referred to in the House of Lords report.

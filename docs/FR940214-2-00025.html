El Paso Natural Gas Co. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=71 g=1 f=1 --> [Docket No. CP94&hyph;183&hyph;000] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Take notice that on January 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (``El Paso''), a Delaware corporation, whose mailing address is Post Office Box 1492, El Paso, Texas, 79978, filed an application at Docket No. CP94&hyph;183&hyph;000, pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act (``NGA'') and &sect;157.5 et seq., of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (``Commission'') Regulations Under the NGA, for an order granting abandonment authority effective January 1, 1996, and terminating certain certificates of public convenience and necessity in effect on such date to the extent such certificates apply to El Paso's gas gathering, dehydration, purification, and products extraction facilities, with appurtenances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that it intends, effective January 1, 1996, to complete a major corporate restructuring in which all of El Paso's gas gathering, treating, and processing functions will be transferred to and assumed by El Paso Field Services Company (``Field Services''), El Paso's wholly-owned subsidiary. After facility transfer, El Paso will no longer perform any gathering, dehydration, purification, or products extraction activities, nor will it own any facilities for that purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that, first, it desires abandonment authorization only with respect to those facilities that the Commission finds constitute nonjurisdictional gathering or processing facilities under section 1(b) of the NGA. Second, Field Services requires and, in its Petition for Declaratory Order filed concurrently with El Paso's abandonment application, requests a determination that it may establish the rates, terms, and conditions for the nonjurisdictional services it provides through negotiations with the parties requesting such services. With respect to gathering facilities that were certificated, El Paso seeks and order: (1) Determining that the facilities are not jurisdictional facilities; and (2) upon said determination, granting abandonment authority with respect to any certificate that would otherwise be in the effect on January 1, 1996, to the extent such certificate applies to a nonjurisdictional facility. All of the certificated facilities for which abandonment is sought constitute nonjurisdictional gathering or processing facilities under the primary function test developed in Farmland Industries Inc., 23 FERC &para;61,063 (1983), it is asserted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that the certificated facilities which constitute part of El Paso's gathering systems, and for which abandonment is requested represent only $77.418,883 of gross plant out of a total of $519,464,972 of gross plant for all facilities to be transferred to Field Services and, on a net plant basis, only $43,151,458 out of the $221,296,764 of total gathering system net plant (as of November 30, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, El Paso states that although it will cease to provide gathering and related services currently being rendered under its part 284 Transportation Service Agreements (``TSA''), Field Services, as described in its Petition for Declaratory Order, intends to offer to provide all of such services on an open-access basis. Thus, there will be no interruption of the services available to any party currently receiving service under such a TSA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to its part 284 transactions, El Paso sets forth that in a few instances El Paso provides transportation services pursuant to arrangements that are filed as ``special rate schedules'' in Volume No. 2 of El Paso's FERC Gas Tariff. Special Rate Schedule Z&hyph;8 is a Gathering Agreement between El Paso and TOC-Rocky Mountain Inc., as successor to Tenneco Oil Company, dated May 9, 1984, providing for gathering services in the San Juan Basin. Special Rate Schedule Z&hyph;9 is a similar Gathering Agreement between El Paso and Conoco Inc. also dated May 9, 1984, and providing for gathering services in the San Juan Basin. Inasmuch as all of the facilities required for performance under the Agreements will be transferred to Field Services, El Paso intends to assign the two Agreements to Field Services effective January 1, 1996. El Paso requested Commission authorization to cancel special Rate Schedules Z&hyph;8 and Z&hyph;9 and for such abandonment authorization as may be necessary for that purpose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso also requests such authorization as may be necessary to abandon services under special Rate Schedule T&hyph;14 (Volume No. 2 Combination Agreement with Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America) insofar as it provides for gathering or related services utilizing the facilities to be transferred to Field Services. In addition, with respect to certain exchange arrangements contained in El Paso's Volume No. 2 Tariff which provides for El Paso to redeliver gas received on its mainline system to delivery points on its gathering system, El Paso intends to enter into appropriate arrangements with Field Services to accomplish the redeliveries required and thus does not request any Commission authorization with respect to such arrangements. El Paso sets forth that Field Services will provide service as an open-access transporter and specifically intends to provide any necessary gathering services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso states that the conveyance of El Paso's gathering facilities to Field Services on January 1, 1996, will not have any impact on El Paso's existing gas sales obligations and arrangements, nor will it affect El Paso's performance under any existing gas purchase contract.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> El Paso avers that all mainline services currently provided by El Paso will continue to be provided in accordance with El Paso's FERC Gas Tariff. No material rate issues are raised by the transfer of these facilities. Finally, there will be no adverse environmental effects from the abandonment proposed herein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment date:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> February 25, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

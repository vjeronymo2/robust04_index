			<p>940402 FT  02 APR 94 / Amnesty urged for 'black' economy Businesses in the so-called 'black' economy should be offered an amnesty on their undeclared activities if they agree to enter a new low-tax sector for innovative enterprises, the Adam Smith Institute is to propose next week. The institute says the sector would be the economic equivalent of a greenhouse - a sheltered part of the economy in which fledgling businesses could grow. The think-tank, which pioneered Thatcherite policies in the 1980s, says the greenhouse would operate like an enterprise zone, but with its exemptions applying to an economic category instead of a geographical area. In the same package the institute proposes the abolition of capital gains tax and inheritance tax. The radical proposals are intended to demonstrate continuing intellectual dominance by the right in policy thinking. The institute will urge a boost to the UK economy through measures to encourage small businesses and knowledge-based companies. 'The aim should be to encourage inventiveness and innovation, not to try and keep it under control,' says the institute. Among the recommendations are large tax cuts for innovative small businesses and the lifting of regulations intended for larger concerns. The aim would be to make Britain an exploiter of ideas which other countries would pay royalties to use. The proposals will apppear in a list of 100 targets the Conservative party's leading free-market campaigners believe the UK can achieve in the next 25 years. The institute will urge that the communications industry be singled out for special treatment. Inventors and companies with innovative products in telecommunications, television and information networks should be encouraged to make Britain a world leader, it believes. The government should set a target for every home to have access to information and entertainment through alternative transmission systems such as terrest-rial broadcasting, cable and satellite, the institute recommends. Achieving this would mean relaxing regulation on companies to encourage expansion. The institute will urge the government to continue cutting taxes and public expenditure over the next 25 years. It will propose a target of 10 per cent for the basic rate of tax and 20 per cent for the higher rate. It says public expenditure should be cut to 20 per cent of GDP by the year 2020, by further privatisation and cash controls on the public sector. 20-20 Vision.

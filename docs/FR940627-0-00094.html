			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Verification of Registration on Board Vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commenters questioned the need for the proposed requirement for vessel carriers to have a copy of a valid registration certificate or other document displaying a valid registration number on board each vessel. The International Chamber of Shipping stated that the proposed requirement would add to the paperwork burden on the ship and increase the workload of the ship's command. This commenter further noted that RSPA already has access to a ship's registration numbers at the operator's office or at the office of the operator's agent. The Steamship Operators Intermodal Committee claimed the total population of vessel owners, operators, and their agents is relatively small and readily identifiable. The U.S. Atlantic and Gulf/Australia New Zealand Conference added that vessels do not present the problems of vast numbers and mobility presented by motor vehicles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Adoption of this requirement could avert potentially significant and costly delays for vessels entering and clearing U.S. port areas. The marginal cost associated with requiring a transporter's registration number on board a vessel is clearly outweighed by more significant costs resulting from time-consuming inspections by Coast Guard personnel. A readily available copy of the certificate of registration or other document indicating a valid registration number would eliminate any need for communication between the master of the vessel and the vessel owner/lessor (who could be domiciled in a foreign country) and subsequent inquiries to an agent representing the vessel. Therefore, RSPA is adopting the proposed requirement for a merchant vessel carrier to maintain the Certificate of Registration or another document indicating the valid registration number on board each vessel carrying hazardous material subject to the registration requirements readily available to enforcement personnel. However, because of the brief time period between publication of this final rule and its effective date, RSPA is providing a delay until January 1, 1995, to comply with this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Other Issues Addressed By Commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters opposed RSPA's proposal that offerors and transporters check each other's registration status. Responsibility for enforcing registration requirements, logistical problems, administrative burdens, and increased costs were the predominant reasons offered by commenters opposing this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commenters overwhelmingly believed that federal and state agencies should be responsible for enforcing the regulations, not industry. A related concern expressed by commenters is that a person otherwise in compliance with the regulations could be in violation of the registration requirements by unknowingly doing business with a customer who falsely claimed to be registered. Furthermore, commenters feared that persons who are in compliance with the registration requirements and refuse to do business with unregistered customers may lose their customers and revenue to less scrupulous competitors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrative burdens were identified as the creation of new databases, maintenance of additional files, and preparation of correspondence. Increased costs would involve additional function-specific training of personnel to determine if a shipment is subject to registration, higher clerical expenses for correspondence and recordkeeping, and delays or cancellations caused by a last-minute exchange of registration information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> According to many commenters, a ``logistical nightmare'' would result from this proposed requirement, especially when intermodal transportation is involved. Other complicated situations cited by commenters involve selection of a transporter by a customer, customer-provided transport vehicles, interlining carriers, and infrequent or irregular shipments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

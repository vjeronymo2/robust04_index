In his words, "regarding the 1920 Tartu peace  treaty as the only basis of its relations with Russia, Estonia  insists that part of the present Leningrad and Pskov regions be  given back to it".    Commenting on the results of the talks, Russian negotiating  chief Vasiliy Svirin told reporters that his country was above  all guided by the principle of inviolability of frontiers sealed  by the Concluding Act of the 1975 Helsinki Conference.    As for the progress of Russian-Estonian talks on the whole,  the heads of the two negotiating teams expressed dissatisfaction  about their results. The agreement on troop withdrawal was  never signed. The Russian side demands that security guarantees  for military pensioners and members of their families form part  of this agreement, while Estonia agrees to discuss this issue  only upon presentation of a schedule for pulling out the 2,600  Russian troops still staying on Estonian territory.    Apart from this, Svirin noted, the Russian delegation to the  talks is concerned over Estonia's deviation from earlier signed  agreements on mutual claims. Under these agreements, Russia is  to transfer to the Baltic state 4,900 military installations on  its territory, and Estonia is to refrain from any claims for  ecological damage it incurred. Furthermore, Estonia is to  allocate 23 million dollars for accommodating Russian servicemen  leaving the republic.    Following Estonia's departure from these agreements, Svirin  said, Russia will be forced to withdraw the remaining troops  according to a schedule set by it unilaterally. This means that  Russia may go back on the earlier fixed deadline for troop  pullout, August 31, 1994. And by accusing Russia of "not a  constructive stand", the Estonian side dragging out negotiations  or, in Reinart's words, upgrades their level.</p>

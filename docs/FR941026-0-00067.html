For example, appropriate entries include: county taxes, hazard insurance, condominium dues, etc. If a particular payee, such as a taxing body, receives more than one payment during the escrow account computation year, the statement shall indicate each payment and disbursement date.

The servicer shall convert any information contained in electronic storage, microfiche or computerized storage to paper copies for review by the Secretary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) To aid in investigations, the Secretary may also issue an administrative subpoena for the production of documents, and for the testimony of such witnesses as the Secretary deems advisable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If the subpoenaed party refuses to obey the Secretary's administrative subpoena, the Secretary is authorized to seek a court order requiring compliance with the subpoena from any United States district court.

For each such violation, the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty of 50 dollars ($50), except that the total of the assessed penalties shall not exceed $100,000 for any one servicer for violations that occur during any consecutive 12-month period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Violations described in paragraph (m)(1) of this section do not require any proof of intent. However, if a lender or servicer is shown to have intentionally disregarded the requirements that it submit the escrow account statement to the borrower, then the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty of $100 for each violation, with no limit on the total amount of the penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (n)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Civil penalties procedures.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following procedures shall apply whenever the Department seeks to impose a civil money penalty for violation of section 10(c) of RESPA (12 U.S.C. 2609(c)):  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Purpose and scope.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This paragraph explains the procedures by which the Secretary may impose penalties under 12 U.S.C. 2609(d).

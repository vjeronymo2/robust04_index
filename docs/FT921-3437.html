			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Man in The News: Tiny dynamo at the heart of the party - Deng Xiaoping Is it worthwhile to open the window and let in fresh air, though some flies will come in as well?' The question is asked in a homily entitled 'Socialist China mustn't totally reject capitalism', circulated this week by the Chinese embassy in London. The answer is yes: 'Absorbing the better part of the cultures of other peoples to enrich ourselves is the best way to safeguard our socialist culture.' It is the dilemma which has embroiled China's leadership in brutal internal power struggles since it decided in 1978 on the 'open door' policy of economic reform. Reformers, led by Deng Xiaoping, believe that a degree of market economics is compatible with domination by the Communist party. Hardline ideologues fear it is not. Occasionally, victors emerge from the fray - only to plunge rapidly back into it. There is no mistaking the winner of the latest round. At 87, Deng is the world's most resilient political leader, twice rehabilitated after disgrace and reviled in 1966 as the 'number two capitalist roader'. Though he officially retired in 1989, he remains the dominant public figure in China. He is now making probably his last bid to ensure that his legacy will be the continuation of the economic reform process. The first sign that Deng was winning a three-year struggle against hardliners came in January when he popped up in the southern provinces. There, the success of economic reform is most evident. Industry, much of it the result of investment by Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesspeople, is booming, and the proliferation of mobile telephones and Avon ladies suggests that capitalism is taking off. Deng's tiny, frail figure had not been seen in public for a year. But, angered by emphasis in the official media on maintaining a strong ideological line - even including mentions of a 'class struggle' - he was stung into public advocacy of the reformist approach. He visited the dynamic Shenzhen special economic zone, just across the border from Hong Kong, and predicted that Guangdong province would become Asia's fifth 'dragon' within 20 years. He was shown on national television, greeting military leaders in Shanghai. 'Deng had to go to the south because he couldn't get his way in the north,' says Mr Michael Yahuda, a China specialist at the London School of Economics. 'He is struggling for dominance of the heart of the party.' However, the fact that Deng was accompanied on his trip by President Yang Shangkun, who has effective control of the army, as well as by high public security officials, indicated that he was winning the high ground. During the visit, Deng said that economic reforms must continue for 100 years. This week, a billion Chinese found that message emblazoned on the front pages of their party-controlled newspapers. The language he had used in public statements in the south, at first only reported by newspapers in Hong Kong, had been adopted by the ruling 15-man politburo. Yesterday, the newspapers were open about the fact that Deng had won: 'The entire party and especially leading officials on all levels must seriously study the important theories of Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics,' said the People's Daily, the party's official mouthpiece. The immediate consequence of the politburo's unusually public decision is likely to be a purge of more hardline elements, especially in the propaganda machine. Top officials including Premier Li Peng had already begun to put greater emphasis in public statements on the need for continuing economic reform. With the 14th party congress due to be held in the autumn, the message will go out loud and clear through the ranks of the party that the ideologues are in retreat and reform can be carried forward. Two events have made the battle over reform even more intense. The tensions leading up to the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in May 1989 were fomented in part by Deng's economic reforms. Yet it was Deng who sent in the tanks to crush the movement on June 4 in order to preserve the dominance of the party. More recently, the collapse of Soviet communism and the disintegration of the Soviet empire have provided ammunition to both sides in the Chinese power struggle. The ideologues drew the lesson that the party must tighten its control in order to avoid collapse. Deng's view is that, though internal stability must be maintained, economic progress is the only way to preserve Communist party rule. Deng is not a closet capitalist. A member of the Chinese Communist party since the 1920s, he took part in the Long March in the 1930s, and, after the Communists assumed power in 1949, had risen to sixth in the party hierarchy by 1956. He was in disgrace during the Cultural Revolution, but was brought back in 1973 and led the country's recovery. Again stripped of his posts in 1976, he was restored to them in 1977 after the death of Mao Zedong and the arrest of the Gang of Four. He has effectively held power in China for 14 years. The Tiananmen Square massacre was the proof of his belief in maintaining party supremacy at all costs. 'Socialism with Chinese characteristics', however, is his code-phrase for opening the economy to the greatest extent possible without threatening the party. Since this began in 1978, it has meant reforms of agriculture, allowing incentives to farmers and stimulating production; price reform; decentralisation of foreign trade; the beginnings of stock markets; joint ventures with foreign companies; and, most impressively, the creation of special economic zones along the southern coasts in which private-sector investment is encouraged. The next stage will include an attempt to replicate the success of the southern zones by creating new ones along the northern borders with Russia, North Korea and Mongolia. However, the greatest challenge remains how to tackle China's massive, and grossly inefficient, public sector. Since the party organisation is inextricably bound up with the management of state enterprises, job losses are politically difficult to achieve. Reforms have created expectations of greater prosperity. It will be up to Deng's successors to match these or face the consequences. But despite the new commitment to 100 years of reform, it is difficult to look beyond Deng's death. His attempts to designate successors have failed dismally. The most that can be said is that the commitment expressed this week will put his followers in a stronger position at the party congress. But, at least in the south, Deng has created an economic momentum which will be hard to check.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp setback despite good economic data Wall Street IN SPITE OF some good news on the economy, a steep decline in bond prices, uncertainty about the near-term outlook for equities, and heavy program selling left US share prices sharply lower after heavy trading, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 36.47 down at 3,268.69 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 retreated 3.79 to 430.73, while the Nasdaq composite slipped back 3.64 to 678.21. Trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange was again extremely heavy, reaching 304.8m shares. The morning's economic figures should have boosted sentiment. The 40,000 drop in weekly jobless claims had positive implications for labour market conditions and suggested that today's key employment report for December should show that the jobs picture is improving. News of stronger chain store sales and another big rise in consumer confidence was also part of the bright economic package. But investors remain uncertain about the short-term future for stocks. Fears of a downward correction have been holding back buyers all week, and good economic numbers were not enough to revive demand. Tension in the Middle East, computer program selling and a drop in the benchmark 30-year bond contributed to the market's poor performance. Among leading stocks, IBM shed Dollars 1 to Dollars 47, Alcoa fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 70 5/8 , Goodyear tumbled Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 68 3/8 and International Paper lost Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 64 1/2 . Some stocks bucked the trend, notably Philip Morris, which rallied Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 72 5/8 in volume of 5.7m shares after the company reassured investors about the market position of its leading brand, Marlboro, and maintained its attacks on recent government claims about the dangers of 'passive' smoking. Charles Schwab rose Dollars 3 to Dollars 28 5/8 after the discount broker said its fourth-quarter profits will be about 53 per cent higher than a year ago, welcome news to investors after a disappointing third quarter. UAL jumped Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 128 as investors reacted to news of a major cost-cutting programme. Other airline issues also firmed, Delta adding Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 51 7/8 and AMR Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 68 3/4 . Home Shopping Network declined Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 7 3/8 on news that the Justice Department has asked for more information on the pending sale of RMS's controlling interest in Home Shopping to Liberty Media. On the Nasdaq market, Intel maintained its sparkling recent performance, rising Dollars 1 to Dollars 99 5/8 as investors bought in anticipation of strong sales for its new Pentium computer chip. Canada TORONTO stocks followed Wall Street sharply lower, due to weakness in US and Canadian bond prices and lack of fresh news ahead of fourth-quarter earnings. The TSE 300 index fell 34.1 to 3,318.9 and volume was 58.1m shares.</p>

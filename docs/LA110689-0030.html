			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES: SMITH AT UNIVERSAL WASN'T TOO TEMPTING  </P> <P> No, they haven't added a "Last Temptation of Christ" ride to the Universal  Studios Tour. All that Jesus stuff Saturday night was just the Michael W. Smith  concert at the Universal Amphitheatre.  </P> <P> While there was plenty of Christ, there was little sense of temptation -- or  anything to test and challenge faith. Smith and his seven-piece band's show  merely served to affirm the values of a Christian life, no less (or more) than  L.A. Guns affirms a party life as, well, righteous.  </P> <P> The temptation for Smith would appear to be the "George Michael of Christian  pop" tag he's been given. Toward the end of the show he even donned a  Michael-like blue jeans and leather jacket outfit and engaged in the silliest  of several sillily choreographed dance routines.  </P> <P> Let's pretend for a minute that Smith is not a Christian popster, that his show  dealt with the conventional mainstream pop concerns of love and/or lust. What  you'd have then would be just a slick, cliched, gimmicky contempo-pop show --  and probably an empty house, as the enthusiastic, youthful sell-out crowd was  clearly there because of the Christian themes.

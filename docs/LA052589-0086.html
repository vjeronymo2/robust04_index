			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA TOUGHENS PARKING-SPACE RULES  </P> <P> The Santa Clarita City Council approved tough regulations requiring more  parking spaces in new commercial and residential developments, despite  objections from developers who said the standards would raise construction  costs.  </P> <P> The parking regulations, unanimously approved late Tuesday night, also require  larger parking spaces. The width of a standard parking space will increase from  eight feet to nine feet, exceeding the Los Angeles County standard of 8 1/2  feet.  </P> <P> Council members praised the new ordinance, saying a shortage of parking spaces  is inconvenient for thousands of Santa Clarita motorists. "It's a nightmare,"  Councilman Howard P. (Buck) McKeon said.  </P> <P> The ordinance creates a variety of parking standards for commercial buildings,  medical facilities, hotels, fast-food restaurants and residences. The standards  generally call for more parking spaces per square foot of construction than had  been required.  </P> <P> Eva Goetz, community affairs director for the Building Industry Assn., urged  the council to reject the new standards. She said the regulations would raise  development costs and reduce the availability of affordable housing.  </P></p>

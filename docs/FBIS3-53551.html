			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A responsible source within the General Committee of  the General People's Congress [GPC] has stated the following:    We regret the statement issued by the Yemeni Socialist Party  [YSP] Political Bureau in Aden on 15 January 1994. This  statement contained false allegations and fabrications against  the GPC. We will reply to these fabrications later in detail.  However, the serious fabrications about some military moves by  some northern governorates in the direction of previously  divided regions is what should be explained today.    As usual, the YSP Political Bureau's recent statement  reversed facts in a desperate attempt to cover up its  mobilization of armed forces in previously divided outskirts.  This is because it has nothing to say after the facts became  clear to the public at home and abroad.    The YSP should have acted otherwise by withdrawing the  troops  it had massed at previously divided positions in the  governorates of Shabwa, Abyan, and Lahd, instead of accusing  others of doing the same thing, despite its certainty and  knowledge that these accusations are not true.    The GPC, which is eager to maintain unity and safeguard the  security of the people and the homeland, would not even think  about moving troops or mobilizing fighters. This is because it  feels it has responsibility toward all sons of Yemen throughout  the country, and not only in certain governorates to the  exclusion of others. It also feels itself responsible for the  safety of the entire homeland, and not just certain parts.    The source asserted that the committee formed by the House  of  Representatives should embark on a fact-finding mission. Also,  the military committee should take note of how things are  proceeding and also do some fact-finding. Moreover, the  expanded national dialogue committee should be aware of what is  taking place on the ground.</p>

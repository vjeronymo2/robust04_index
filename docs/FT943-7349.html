			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Cuban exodus to US increases Record numbers of Cuban refugees continue to make their way to the US despite the ban on entry announced by the Clinton administration last Thursday. As the Navy assigned resources to support the overstretched Coast Guard to deal with what Mr William Perry, the defence secretary, has called a 'tidal wave of people', the US State Department said it did not expect the new curbs to have an impact on numbers for 'some several days'. The Florida Coast Guard picked up 2,548 people on Monday, a marked rise from a week earlier when, under the former immigration policy, 282 Cuban refugees were taken to Key West for registration with the Immigration and Naturalisation Services. Although many of the Cubans now being picked up may have left unaware of the new policy, which refuses them entry to the US and ships them back to Cuba for detainment at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, the Coast Guard has reported that many others are aware that they will be sent to detention camps. State Department officials pointed to the introduction of an interdiction policy on Haitian refugees which took a week to 10 days to cause a fall in the numbers fleeing Haiti.</p>

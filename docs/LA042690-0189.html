			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Security Pacific Dropped Merger Talks: Security Pacific was negotiating in  January to buy Pacific Western Bancshares, a large San Jose banking firm, but  talks broke down, sources said.  </P> <P> Those sources confirmed that the reason was a fall in the price of Security  Pacific's stock, which would have been swapped for Pacific Western shares.  Security Pacific executives have been frustrated in recent months at the  lackluster performance of the Los Angeles bank's stock because it limits their  ability to buy other banks through stock swaps. Both banks declined comment.  </P></p>

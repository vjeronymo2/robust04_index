			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BURNING BODY OF BOY FOUND  </P> <P> An unidentified boy, about 7 years old, was apparently killed and set afire in  the Santa Susana Knolls area south of Simi Valley, the Ventura County Sheriff's  Department reported Friday.  </P> <P> The boy's body was found by Ventura County firefighters who were trying to  extinguish a brush fire.  </P> <P> It appeared that a flammable liquid had been poured on the body and ignited,  Lt. Kathy Kemp said. A pair of handcuffs was found near the body and may have  been used on the boy before the fire, she said.  </P> <P> The boy was between 6 and 8 years old, Kemp said. Investigators from the  Ventura County medical examiner's office were unable to identify the boy. He  was described as white with brown hair, wearing a T-shirt, shorts, socks and  tennis shoes.  </P> <P> An intensive search of the area with the help of two Sheriff's Department  helicopters failed to turn up any suspects, Kemp said.  </P> <P> Authorities found the body after two motorists reported a brush fire near Black  Canyon Road south of Santa Susana Pass Road about 11:50 a.m., Kemp said.  </P></p>

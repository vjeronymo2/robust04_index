			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Recruitment: Academics get into the act - Career planning in the changing organisation Changing business structures have led to a surge in interest among companies in career patterns. So much so that some 26 companies and public bodies have subscribed to a UK-based research group called the Careers Research Forum, established to investigate best practice in career development. The organisations have each paid Pounds 6,000 to join the forum, which is funding a two-year research programme by Prof David Guest of Birkbeck College at the University of London. The CRF, structured as a limited company, is run by an advisory council of academics and human resource specialists. The panel includes Prof Guest with Prof Peter Herriot director of research at Sundridge Park, Andrew Mayo of ICL, Andrew Garner of Boyden International, the executive search firm, Mike Haffenden of OEC, consultants, and Simon Barrow and Andrew Lambert of People in Business, a management consultancy. The Forum says it was established in response to widespread discussion about changing career patterns. Delayering, fewer voluntary departures and changes in the use of consultants and outsourcing have all reduced the likelihood of one-company careers, say CRF. It adds: 'At the same time there is a rapid change of pace in all organisations. With the advent of new markets, technologies and structures, people are expected to do more and do better, yet with the prospect of limited career progression and no guarantee of security.' The Forum is holding a public conference at the Dorchester Hotel, London, on November 16-17. Further details can be obtained from CRF at 071 336 7790. Without wheels Why do we persist with the company car as a form of reward? Companies have become increasingly concerned about the cost of the company car yet, according to the latest employee benefits report by the Reward Group, most are afraid to withdraw them in case it hinders the recruitment and retention of staff. Perhaps the reason has more to do with basic human nature. The managers responsible for company car policies tend to run company cars themselves and few people want to give up something voluntarily. What many companies have been doing is extending the life of their fleets. Almost a third of those in the Reward survey had lengthened replacement periods, typically by 12 months to four years, or by an additional 20,000 miles. Other trends highlighted by the survey included harmonisation of benefits for all employees - some 45 per cent of companies surveyed had policies to harmonise benefits such as holiday entitlement, hours of work, overtime rates and sick pay among all staff. Reward says that a typical benefits package for a director of a large company (those with turnovers between Pounds 25m and Pounds 200m) would include a company car (provided to 63 per cent of the directors - with free private mileage for 84 per cent), changed every three years or 80,000 miles, free private health insurance (87 per cent) and 25 days a year holiday with a working week of between 46 and 50 hours. Global earnings The answer to all those anxious people who regularly call the jobs column looking for international prices and earnings comparisons has been delivered by the Union Bank of Switzerland in its latest edition of Prices and Earnings Around the Globe. It is three years since UBS produced the last edition, but the latest version has been worth the wait. It not only gives price comparisons on a range of goods and services in 53 cities, but includes data on incomes and earnings across a range of jobs. Whereas secretaries in Geneva, Zurich, Luxembourg, Dusseldorf, and Tokyo seldom earn less than Dollars 35,000 a year, their counterparts in Budapest, Manila, Jakarta, Prague, Bombay, Lagos and Nairobi will earn a tenth of that. The global average salary of a departmental manager is about Dollars 43,300 with the biggest salaries in Tokyo and the top Swiss, German and US cities. The graph (right) shows the average earnings in 53 cities from the weighted hourly net wages of 12 occupations: primary school teachers, bus drivers, car mechanics, building labourers, skilled industrial workers, bank clerks, secretaries, women industrial workers, cooks, saleswomen, department managers, and electrical or mechanical engineers. Employees in Zurich, Geneva, Tokyo, Luxembourg, Chicago and New York have the most take-home pay and those in Nairobi, Lagos, Bombay and Caracas get the least. The dark bars show net income, light bars net income and the figures on the right show the taxes and social security deductions as a percentage of gross income. The figures marked from 0-25 on the bottom line are US dollars.

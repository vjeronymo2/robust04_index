			<p>921231 FT  31 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent winds down for the New Year holiday ACTIVITY was limited, with most bourses seeing the last trading day before the new year, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT investors continued to close their books for 1992, with distinct contrasts in some sectors as professionals decided what the closing price of the year should be, and manipulated the final deals accordingly. As the DAX index ended 2.82 higher at 1,545.05, a couple of percentage points down on the year, the main talking points included a drop in Daimler just before the closing bell, leaving it just 50 pfg higher at DM537. Its own Mercedes subsidiary closed DM6.50 higher at DM408.50. In retailing, Karstadt went the other way with a sudden closing gain of DM15 to DM500. Turnover rose from DM2.9bn to DM3.8bn, and there was some reaction to news. In insurers, AMB fell DM20 to DM750 on Fondiaria's opposition to moves affecting its AMB stake; and while Commerzbank hardly moved on its upcoming rights issue, Deutsche Bank fell DM6.50 to DM647 on the thought that it, too, might have some fundraising in the pipeline. PARIS eased in dull activity and the CAC-40 index closed 11.51 lower at 1,858.77, just off the day's low of 1,856.71. Turnover was FFr1.4bn after Tuesday's FFr2bn. There remained some interest in Hachette after Tuesday's approval of the merdia group's merger with Matra, the electronics concern. Hachette was FFr2.80 stronger at FFr89.50 while Matra was unchanged at FFr194. Financials weakened, with SocGen down FFr4 to FFr611 and Paribas losing FFr6.9 to FFr359.0. Elsewhere, Eurotunnel lost FFr1 to FFr28.20 and BSN shed FFr21 to FFr943. AMSTERDAM entered the long weekend slightly weaker although there was good activity in Begemann, up Fl 4 to Fl 84, on news that the industrial group had sold its pipe coating division for Fl 360m. The CBS Tendency index closed 0.2 lower at 106.3 after a day's high of 106.6 and a low of 105.9. Ahold lost 50 cents to Fl 87.80 after announcing that it had signed a letter of intent to purchase a Dutch confectionery chain from Goudsmit, up Fl 8.50 to Fl 30.50. MILAN lost earlier gains as Sip, the telecommunications company, slipped L15 to L1,500 in late trading. The telecommunications company had traded earlier as high as L1,573, and its fall came after Italy's Pricing Committee agreed to a tariff restructuring for the telephone business - but not until 1994. Other shares in the telecommunications sector also lost ground, affecting the mood of the whole market as the Comit index closed only 2.15 higher at 451.18. Fiat rose 4.9 per cent to settle at L4,145, but then fell to L4,040 on the kerb. MADRID was helped by some institutional buying in thin trading and the general index gained 0.20 to 215.12. Santander recovered some of its earlier loses with a rise of Pta145 to Pta4,300. VIENNA weakened as Lenzig retreated a further Sch29 or 4.6 per cent to Sch595 on Tuesday's news that it would cut the 1992 dividend. The ATX index eased 1.73 to 747.70. STOCKHOLM ended little changed after late profit-taking eroded early gains. The Affarsvarlden index lost 1.1 to 912.6 in turnover of SKr401m. Astra continued to decline with the A shares losing SKr5 to SKr735 and the B shares slipping SKr7 to SKr723. Ericsson lost SKr2 to SKr186. OSLO was firmer with Elkem free shares rising NKr5 to NKr28 as the all-share index gained 2.11 to 372.12 in turnover of NKr221.3m. ISTANBUL was encouraged by news that agreement had been reached in the private metal sector between unions and employers over a pay claim, thereby averting a threatened strike. The 75-share index closed up 38.91 at 3,955.53, in turnover of TL168bn. Among the actives Akal, the textile group, rose TL150 to TL3,550.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- December 30                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1084.25    1083.62    1083.69    1082.87 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1167.78    1165.40    1165.31    1165.16  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1083.98    1083.61    1083.80    1084.02 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1166.35    1166.79    1166.94    1166.76  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Dec 29    Dec 24    Dec 23    Dec 22    Dec 21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1086.47   1078.93   1073.60   1072.92   1059.21 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1167.59   1160.29   1154.31   1157.60   1145.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 - 1084.62 ; 200 - 1168.49 Low/day: 100 - 1082.23  200 - 1163.89  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

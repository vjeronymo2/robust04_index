			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report from Cuito by correspondent Abel Abraao] </F>   [Text] Clashes continue in the city of Cuito between  government and National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola [UNITA] forces. Today, more than 5,000 shells were fired  by UNITA at the martyred city of Cuito. The death toll  resulting from UNITA's shelling has risen to 175. Hospital  sources say about 350 people -- mostly children, elderly men,  and women -- have been wounded. The hospital lacks the means to  cope with the situation.    Today's clashes were fiercer than yesterday's. The city of  Cuito has become a true inferno. Jonas Savimbi's UNITA  continues to shell the city and mount strong attacks on it. The  situation, however, is under the control of government forces,  who continue to deal severe blows to the enemy of the people.</p>

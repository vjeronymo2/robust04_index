			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Sterling hits new D-Mark low: Major reopens row over realignment - Bundesbank dashes hope of rate cut STERLING hit a new low yesterday against the D-Mark, as Germany's Bundesbank dashed hopes that it might lower interest rates. The pound's weakness continued as Mr John Major, the prime minister, reopened the war of words with the German authorities by denying that they had requested a realignment of sterling within the European exchange rate mechanism on the weekend before Black Wednesday. The Treasury believes a note from the Bundesbank president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, published earlier this week, implied the bank sought realignment of several currencies that weekend, September 11-12. Mr Major, replying to a demand from Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, for an explanation of events surrounding sterling's suspension in the ERM, wrote: 'Apart from Italy, I do not know whether the German authorities contacted any countries that weekend and pressed them to realign. 'What I do know - and what the chancellor of the exchequer has made clear - is that the German authorities made no request to the United Kingdom that sterling should realign.' The prime minister's reply did not cover the possibility that the Bundesbank had requested a realignment before that weekend. Mr Major also pointed out that 'all the intervention that the Bundesbank has undertaken must be financed by the Bank of England'. Earlier, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, had warned that the government could not use sterling's suspension from the ERM to allow the currency to go into free fall. Mr Heseltine also echoed a warning earlier this week from Mr Major that the government could not rule out tax increases next year if spending and the deficit are not held in check. The Treasury said the Bank of England's reserves fell by an underlying Pounds 4.4bn last month as a result of heavy intervention by the UK authorities in the vain effort to prop up sterling ahead of suspension from the ERM. The sharp fall in sterling gave an awkward jolt to Mr Norman Lamont's preparations for what promises to be a critical Tory party conference for the chancellor in Brighton next week. Investors switched funds out of pounds and into D-Marks after Mr Schlesinger said that the Bundesbank would keep its main credit rates steady for the 'time being'. Mr Schlesinger said German credit rates were not unduly high given the pressures of unification. Speaking after a meeting of the central bank's council in Schwerin, eastern Germany, he revealed that total Bundesbank intervention since the beginning of September to support weak ERM currencies had totalled DM92bn (Pounds 36.8bn). The Bundesbank's lack of action on interest rates was the main factor behind the pound shedding 4 1/2 pfennigs yesterday to a close in London of DM2.43, an 11 1/2 pfennig loss on the week. At last night's level, sterling is more than 50 pfennigs below its former central ERM rate of DM2.95. Pressure on sterling was exacerbated by continuing uncertainties about how the UK intends to operate economic policy after the debacle of ERM suspension. The prospect of higher borrowing costs next year would raise further doubts over Mr Lamont's future as chancellor. He already faces an uphill task in persuading party activists next Thursday, when he is due to deliver his conference speech, that the government still has a coherent economic strategy. As concern about the economy spilled over to equities, the FT-SE 100 index of leading UK shares slipped 22.6 for a close of 2,549.7. The fall in prices on the London market was helped by a decline on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones Industrial Averageclosed down 53.76 at 3,200.61. Elsewhere in Europe the effect of the lack of movement on German interest rates added to pressures on some of the weak ERM currencies, particularly the Portuguese escudo and the Irish punt. The Bank of Spain was forced to increase its daily intervention borrowing rate from 13 per cent to 14 per cent as the peseta fell to a close of 71.32 against the D-Mark, very near its ERM floor of 72.62. The Bundesbank's council's decision to maintain its main credit rates disappointed many investors who had been looking for an easing in monetary policy to help the overall European economy. The Bundesbank last reduced its rates, after being under intense international pressure, on September 14.

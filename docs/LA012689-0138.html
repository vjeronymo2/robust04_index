			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOWELL MILKEN IS MUCH MORE THAN OLDER BROTHER'S SHADOW  </P> <P> Lowell Milken has been portrayed in the press as subordinate to his older  brother, Michael, and the plea bargain struck by Drexel Burnham Lambert with  the government is consistent with that image.  </P> <P> The agreement requires Drexel to fire Michael Milken immediately and withhold  all of his 1988 bonus. But Lowell Milken is allowed to receive half of his  bonus from last year and can remain in his job until his anticipated indictment  on criminal charges, which could come as soon as today.  </P> <P> But people who know both men say that Lowell is more his brother's equal than  his second-in-command, and that Lowell's grasp of nuance and detail provide a  perfect complement for the broad strokes his brother painted across the  financial landscape of the United States.  </P> <P> "I've read where Lowell is Michael's right-hand man, but people who say that  don't understand the relationship," said a friend of both men. "They are  brothers and they are very close. Lowell is Michael's confidant. But they are  not twins. Lowell is his own man."  </P> <P> Lowell Jay Milken, 40, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, graduated summa cum  laude at UC Berkeley and was editor of the law review at UCLA law school.  </P> <P> A decade ago, he left a promising career with the Los Angeles law firm of Irell  &amp; Manella to join his brother in the fledgling "junk bond" operation that  Michael had moved to Beverly Hills from Drexel's New York headquarters in 1978.  </P> <P> "Lowell's primary area of practice was tax law, and I remember him as being  exceptionally smart," said Edmund M. Kaufman, a senior partner at Irell &amp;  Manella. "He was enjoying being a lawyer. He was very imaginative and creative,  and he was extremely smart and a very hard worker."  </P> <P> At its upper levels, where Milken appeared to be headed, tax law is  intellectually challenging in addition to requiring enormous attention to  detail. This penchant for detail made Lowell a vital adjunct to his brother --  and, along with his role as confidant, a target of the government investigators  who have been on the elder Milken's trail for years.  </P> <P> When he joined Michael at Drexel, Lowell's first job was managing the  investments that Michael had been making for both of them over the years. In  addition to administrative duties for the investment firm, Lowell analyzed the  risks of potential deals and the financial data for the companies for which  Drexel issued junk bonds.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Valuable Real Estate  </P> <P> As the junk bond business mushroomed, so did the wealth of the Milken brothers  and many others who worked in the Beverly Hills office with them. Lowell  increasingly assumed the job of managing the investments in land, office  buildings and securities.  </P> <P> Among the holdings of their numerous partnerships is the building at Wilshire  Boulevard and Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills that houses Drexel's junk bond  operation and Gump's, the fashionable department store.  </P> <P> Lowell has a title of senior vice president at Drexel, and his office is within  shouting distance of the big X-shaped trading desk where his brother ruled the  junk bond business.  </P> <P> Friends say the brothers are similar in many ways. Because they are only two  years apart, they shared many of the same friends growing up and still do so as  adults. Both are portrayed by friends and associates as devoted family men,  while others say both can be abrasive in their relations with colleagues. Both  wear toupees, and Lowell is shorter than his brother.  </P> <P> Michael lives in an Encino house of modest proportions, at least for a man with  an estimated personal net worth of close to $1 billion. Although Lowell is  thought to be worth considerably less, his tastes appear to be a bit richer.  </P> <P> Property records show that he and his wife, Sandra, own a 7,142-square-foot  house on Mandeville Canyon Road near Topanga State Park in Los Angeles. The  couple paid $869,500 for the property in 1979, and it is now valued at more  than $1.3 million. The 37-year-old, stucco house has seven bedrooms, six baths  and a pool.  </P> <P> Records also show that they own a contemporary two-story beach house in Malibu  with five bedrooms and four baths. They bought the house in 1984 for $975,000,  apparently for cash, according to the records.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Aids Many Charities  </P> <P> In November, 1986, Lowell and Sandra Milken donated $7.6 million in cash and  securities to create their own charitable foundation, which shares offices with  Michael's three foundations.  </P> <P> Lowell and his wife, who have three children, are big-league benefactors in  their own right, handing out $1.2 million to 29 organizations in 1987. The  largest grant, $450,000, went to the Jewish Federation Council of Los Angeles,  and an education project received $323,000.  </P> <P> Lowell has also been active in his brother's foundation, helping direct the  contributions and serving as president of the biggest family charity.  </P> <P> As their fortunes have become intertwined in recent years, so have their fates.  Lowell joined his brother as a defendant in the civil suit filed in September  by the Securities and Exchange Commission that charges them with stock  manipulation and insider trading. And he seems likely to be indicted with his  brother.  </P> <P> Lowell's chief attorney, Michael F. Armstrong, reacted angrily to Drexel's  decision to withhold half of Lowell's 1988 income, issuing a statement that  called it a "blatant violation of his constitutional rights."  </P> <P> Armstrong said the money was being withheld despite assurances from Drexel's  chief executive, Frederick H. Joseph, that Joseph had no indication Lowell had  done anything wrong. Armstrong also said one of Drexel's lawyers assured him  earlier that the firm would refuse to settle with the government if the deal  implied any wrongdoing on the part of Lowell Milken.  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: PROTECTING VIEWERS  </P> <P> Warning to Hollywood studios: Condom manufacturers can advertise on TV, but  references to prophylactics in commercials for movies are a no-no with the  Motion Picture Assn. of America, which controls advertising and ratings for the  film industry.  </P> <P> Producer Ray Stark has faced the MPAA's condom taboo with his upcoming "Steel  Magnolias" for Tri-Star. In an original spot for the film, newlywed Julia  Roberts is startled to find that friends have decorated the wedding car with  inflated condoms. Mom (Sally Field) comforts Roberts by telling her the condoms  will remind her of the importance of safe sex.  </P> <P> CBS OKd the "Steel Magnolias" commercial for viewing after 9 p.m., but the MPAA  nixed it.  </P> <P> MPAA's Bethlyn Hand, who supervises the review of such advertising, explained  that independent stations with more liberal standards might have aired the spot  in earlier time periods. "Advertising must be suited for a general audience,"  she added. "Parents must find nothing objectionable."  </P> <P> Stark protested the edict in a letter to Hand: "(Condom) is a word that may not  be part of the everyday vernacular at the MPAA office in Sherman Oaks, but it  is one propelled into the spotlight by the Surgeon General, by sex educators,  (etc.)," Stark wrote.  </P> <P> Hand told us the spot may yet air -- with "condom" bleeped out.

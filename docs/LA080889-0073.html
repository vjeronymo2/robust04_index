			<p><P> August 8, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON CALIFORNIA: RAVENS RAP ON A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY  </P> <P> For those who bring a ghoulish curiosity to their scrutiny of Southern  California's environmental decay, I offer the case of the raven. The evolution  of the raven to Frankenstein status may not be a major milepost of our decline,  but it's a sign of something. You might put the raven in the same league with  the solemya clam.  </P> <P> Connoisseurs of this sort of thing will recall that the solemya clam was  discovered thriving in the sewage sludge at the bottom of Santa Monica Bay.  Long after other marine life had been extinguished by the soup of heavy metals  and petrochemicals deposited there by the city, the clam could be seen sliding  through the muck, contentedly gulping gaseous sulfur bubbling up from the goo.  The solemya clam had a talent for adapting.  </P> <P> And so too does the raven. In fact, both creatures are interesting because they  have turned environmental filth to their own, personal advantage. But whereas  the clam was content with its lot down there in the sludge, the raven has  proven more ambitious. First it took over the Mojave. And now the raven may be  headed for the city.  </P> <P> As recently as the 1940s, ravens were rarely encountered in the Mojave or  elsewhere in Southern California. A larger cousin to the crow, ravens are part  scavenger and part predator, and most likely they found the pickings slim in  the untrammeled desert.  </P> <P> The desert, of course, was not destined to stay untrammeled for very long. Even  in the 1940s, a pattern of degradation had become apparent. The Mojave was  losing its large, grassy regions and becoming a drier, harsher place. As the  savanna areas disappeared, they were replaced by the sage and thistle-covered  sand we see today.  </P> <P> It's possible this decay was caused by over-grazing, though no one is certain.  In any case, that change was just the beginning. New roads began to crisscross  the desert and towns sprang up. Each town developed what is delicately called a  disposal problem, and soon there was a corresponding landfill site and sewage  pond.  </P> <P> Now, this would hardly qualify the Mojave for Bhopal status. But in the desert,  small shifts in the environment tend to get magnified, and that's what happened  in the Mojave. A window of opportunity had been created for the raven.  </P> <P> Each new road turned into a prolific producer of flat rodents, snakes and  birds. The ravens began to patrol the roads in sorties, looking for the dead  and dying. If they tired of road kills, they could fly to the nearest dump for  some soggy Cheez-its. And there were always the sewage ponds. Whole flocks  gathered on the spray arms, waiting for tasty bits of effluent to shoot out.  The Mojave, once an austere place for the raven, had been turned into a food  factory.  </P> <P> Eugene Cardiff, an ornithologist with San Bernardino County, watched the  transformation take place. He says it's hard to imagine a creature better  suited to exploit the opportunity. The raven is big, strong and, perhaps most  important, intelligent. Certain individuals have been described in scientific  journals as being capable of crude tool use. Not your ordinary bird.  </P> <P> And exploit is just what the raven did. In the last 20 years, its population  has grown 1,528% in the Mojave, and the raven has now taken over large chunks  of the desert. This spring the Bureau of Land Management proposed shooting  ravens because they were eating the desert tortoise into extinction. In some  desert valleys, Cardiff says, few finches or wrens or small rodents or even  lizards are left because the ravens have got them all.  </P> <P> Cardiff, who talks about the raven with a mixture of awe and horror, believes  their population probably has leveled off in the desert. There are only so many  nest sites out there, and most are being used, he says. For the raven  population to grow further, it must expand its territory.  </P> <P> This possibility intrigues Cardiff. He believes a logical next step for the  raven would be Los Angeles. After all, he says, the city offers garbage and  sewage in huge abundance, not to mention many flat cats and flat dogs. The only  thing standing in the way of a raven takeover is the crow, the raven's smaller  relative now doing very well in the city.  </P> <P> So far there's no convincing evidence of a big move on L.A. by the ravens. But  sightings in the city have increased. There's a few along the river, and one  pair on the UCLA campus. The UCLA ravens skulk around the campus trees, staring  balefully at the crows. These birds might be nothing more than raven  adventurists, of course, or undesirables kicked out of the main population. And  then again, they just might be scouts.  </P></p>

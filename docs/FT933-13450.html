			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Investors cool on 'China stock' THE HONG KONG portion of a HKDollars 2.9bn (Pounds 253m) capital raising for Shanghai Petrochemical, the largest of nine state-owned Chinese companies to be listed in the colony, was only 1.77 times subscribed. In Hong Kong, where new issues are usually many times subscribed, local investor response was seen as disappointing. However, the issue would have fared worse had not the two issuing houses subscribed for half the shares. Mr Wang Jiming, chairman of Shanghai Petrochemical, said: 'The Hong Kong offering would have been subscribed 1.24 times without the applications from Merrill Lynch and Peregrine Capital.' Shanghai Petrochemical is offering 1.68bn H shares - 30 per cent of the company - split equally between Hong Kong and the rest of the world. The subscription price will be established by a tender in New York. The company's advisers have set a guide price of between HKDollars 1.55 and HKDollars 1.74 a share. Since the company came to the market on July 6 concerns about the Chinese economy have lessened the appeal of 'China stocks'. Equally important, investors found the pricing of Shanghai Petrochemical too aggressive. Most new issues in Hong Kong are floated at six to eight times prospective earnings - leaving plenty in it for 'stags'. Judging by the guide range, Shanghai Petrochemical is priced on a prospective p/e of 12.3 to 13.8. Standard Chartered and Wardley backed out from underwriting the Hong Kong portion of the issue. The 'failure' of the Hong Kong float drew sharp criticism of the colony's financial community by Mr Philip Tose, chairman of Peregrine. He accused his fellow merchant bankers of not understanding that underwriting was about accepting risk. He also called for Hong Kong's system of pricing new issues to follow US practice where tenders are used. He said the issue was seeing heavy demand internationally, but 'because of the way it has to be offered in Hong Kong we got the tail wagging the dog.' Guangzhou Shipyard International, owned by the People's Liberation Army, plans to list in Hong Kong early next month.</p>

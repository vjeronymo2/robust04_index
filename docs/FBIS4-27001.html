			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 28 (XINHUA) -- China plans to boost  its electricity generating capacity by eight to nine percent  over the upcoming seven years so as to meet the growing demand,  said Shi Dazhen, minister of power industry.    Shi said China's power industry development will follow two  steps: To increase the power generation capacity from 15  million kw to 17 million kw from 1995 to 1997; to add over 20  million kw to bring the total power generating capacity to 300  million kw during the last three years of this century.    While boosting its power industry, shi said, China is ready  to step up technological renovation and advancement of the  electric power network to save more energy.    To ease the acute power shortages in many areas, China plans  to transmit electricity to all Chinese counties so that over 95  percent of the rural areas will use electricity and up to 1000  counties will attain the national standards in rural  electrification, Shi said.</p>

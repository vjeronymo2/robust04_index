Goncz, holding a press conference, said Poland and Hungary  are linked by the common goal of quick integration with Western  Europe, through European Union membership as well as through  cooperation in other fields of international political life.    He stressed the importance of regional cooperation,  including  cooperation within the Visegrad group. "There should be a  multicolour Europe of regions, while our integration with  European structures would serve Europe as a whole as well as our  region," said Goncz.    "We have not discussed military cooperation during this  visit," the president said adding, however, that there are wide  possibilities of cooperation between Polish and Hungarian arms  industries. He said he discussed with Polish partners such  cooperation and the difficult financial situation of those  industries in both countries.    Arpad Goncz assured the Polish hosts that there will be no  return to the old system after May elections in Hungary  "irrespective who wins the elections... Hungary's foreign  policy, approach towards the economy and Polish-Hungarian  relations will remain unchanged." He added that "for Hungary,  Poland, ruled by the left, elected in democratic elections,  remains to be the same partner as it had been before."</p>

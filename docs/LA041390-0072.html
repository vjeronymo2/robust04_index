			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> TENNESSEE;  </P> <P> 'CUSTODY' OF FROZEN EMBRYOS CHALLENGED  </P> <P> A judge's decision to give legal protection to seven frozen human embryos went  far beyond his authority and should be overturned, a lawyer said in an appeal.  </P> <P> The ruling was made last September in the divorce case of Junior Lewis Davis  and Mary Sue Davis. The only issue was what to do with the eggs that resulted  from in-vitro fertilization. Mrs. Davis testified she wanted the embryos in an  attempt to have children. Davis said he did not want the embryos used in any  fashion without his consent. A judge ruled "life begins at conception" and  accorded the embryos the same legal status as children would have in a custody  dispute. He granted temporary custody to Mrs. Davis.  </P></p>

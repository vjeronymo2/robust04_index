			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 7 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam  warned North Korea Tuesday that if it continues developing  nuclear arms, it will only face further isolation and eventual  destruction.    Kim issued the warning in his message to a meeting of the  Seoul area members of the Advisory Council for Democratic and  Peaceful Unification (ACDPU) held at the Sejong Cultural Center,  which was read by Prime Minister Yi Yong-tok.    The whole world shares the view that North Korea must be  prevented from developing nuclear arms, the chief executive  emphasized.    "The government has endeavored to settle the North Korean  nuclear dispute and improve inter-Korean relations with maximum  patience and wisdom over the past year," he said.    Kim urged Pyongyang to give up its reckless nuclear arms  development program in line with the trends of history and "come  out to pave the way for co-prosperity of South and North Korea."    The road to unification will open when peace arrives on the  Korean peninsula so that "South and North Korea can seek  co-prosperity on the basis of cooperation and exchange," he  stressed.    The president called on North Korea's leaders to ponder  genuine co-prosperity and the path to improved welfare of the  nation.    Korean reunification is not an illusion but a near-term  reality in view of the trends of history, he noted. "Our  persistent efforts at reform and change are preparations for  unification."    The ACDPU Seoul meeting passed a resolution urging Pyongyang  to accept international and inter-Korean nuclear inspections, to  adapt to the global trends of development and reform, to  guarantee the human rights of its people and to renounce the  so-called unification front strategy.</p>

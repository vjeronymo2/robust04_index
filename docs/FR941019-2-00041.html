The Debanham DRS was previously utilized to deliver natural gas to Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel), an affiliate of Questar. Mountain Fuel has installed and is currently operating a new intermediate high-pressure (IHP) distribution line adjacent to the Debenham DRS, to serve a new residential subdivision and additionally receives natural gas through Questar's DRS WA0388, located west of the Debenham DRS, to serve its remaining customers. Questar states that the Debanham DRS consists of two 3/4-inch taps, approximately 105 feet of 3/4-inch pipeline, a can-type regulator set and appurtenant facilities. Questar further states that the total investment associated with the DRS facilities proposed to be abandoned is $788. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after the Commission has issued this notice, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to &sect;157.205 of the Regulations under the NGA (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the allowed time, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest.

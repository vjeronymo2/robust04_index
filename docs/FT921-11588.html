			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Italy lets Sud Tyrol have more autonomy THE disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918 may well be viewed by historians as one of the main causes of today's violent ethnic conflicts in Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union. But a decision yesterday by the Italian government to allow the German-speaking Sud Tyroleans more autonomy may inject a glimmer of hope into the belief that disputes over ethnicity and autonomy can be solved peacefully. Indeed, the civil war in neighbouring Yugoslavia might have provided Rome with the impetus to settle at least one of its ethnic disputes. Until 1919, when the Paris Peace Conference supervised the break-up of the Habsburg Empire, the German-speaking region, which at that time had only 8,000 Italians, was ruled from Imperial Vienna. After 1919, Sud Tyrol was annexed to Italy, which tried to populate it with southern Italians. Today, over 70 per cent of its 440,000 inhabitants are German-speaking. Yet despite economic prosperity, coupled with Rome's decision to extend autonomy to language, newspapers, schools and courts, the Sud Tyroleans never quite got used to the idea of Italian rule. Nor did they like the idea of paying their taxes to Rome. Above all, the Sud Tyroleans resented Rome's refusal to allow their autonomy to be guaranteed internationally. That, at least, was what agreed in 1946 between Vienna and Rome on the understanding that Sud Tyrol would not claim the right to self-determination if its autonomy was internationally recognised. Italy saw the issue as a purely bilateral affair, Austria said it would be the protective power of Sud Tyrol in every respect, while the Sud Tyroleans flung bombs at Italian targets in the 1960s to press home their case. That made Rome sit up. Under an agreement reached with Vienna in 1972, and to be implemented by 1974, more autonomy was extended. Barring the recognition that its autonomy would be internationally recognised, Rome yesterday made further concessions. A peaceful outcome might well disabuse the pessimists that ethnicity, nationalism and autonomy does not necessarily lead to bloodshed, or the violent break-up of states.</p>

			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> WEEKENDER: CINCO DE MAYO FESTIVITIES WILL LIGHT UP THE SOUTH BAY FOR NEARLY A  MONTH.  </P> <P> Cinco de Mayo is a specific date on the calendar. But the South Bay will spend  almost a month celebrating the Mexican patriotic holiday with free festivals,  entertainment, dances, a parade and a luncheon scheduled over the coming weeks.  </P> <P> Kicking off local festivities this weekend, Wilmington and Carson expect big  turnouts for fiestas marking the Battle of Puebla on May 5, 1862, in which  outnumbered Mexican troops defeated a large force of French soldiers. Although  the French dominated Mexico for several more years, the battle came to  symbolize Mexican resistance to foreign intervention.  </P> <P> If the first Cinco de Mayo was all about fighting, today's holiday is all about  fun, with food, and singing and dancing that mingles traditional Mexican  culture with Latin rock.  </P> <P> "We want the people of the Harbor area to celebrate," said John Mendez, who  heads the Wilmington Fiesta Committee sponsoring the celebration Saturday from  11 a.m. to 10 p.m. at Wilmington's International Longshoremen's &amp;  Warehousemen's Union hall at 231 West C St.  </P> <P> Community organizations will operate food and game booths to raise funds.  Headlining the entertainment will be Mariachi Los Camperos, which backed Linda  Ronstadt on her "Canciones de Mi Padre" album. "They're like the Glenn Miller  of mariachis," Mendez said.  </P> <P> Carson's 15th annual Cinco de Mayo celebration will be held Sunday from 11 a.m.  to 6 p.m. at Carson Park, 21411 Orrick St. "It's a joyous afternoon, a  celebration," said Park Director Dan Cisneros. "It's become a popular event and  we get more than 2,000 people."  </P> <P> This year's entertainment includes amateur boxing and, in the musical vein,  Mexican recording artist Mari Jimenez, a Wilmington band called Chiyle, and the  Grupo Xochitlan Folklorico Dancers from Carson. The colorfully costumed dancers  keep the regional dances of Mexico alive, said Cisneros. "Kids don't understand  it, so they try to expose them to this type of music and culture, explaining  each dance in detail," he said.  </P> <P> Cal State Dominguez Hills -- at 1000 E. Victoria St. in Carson -- will mark  Cinco de Mayo on Thursday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Once again, Mariachi Los  Camperos, along with a group performing Aztec dances, will headline the  celebration, which will be open to students and the public. Several Mexican  folk artists will be on hand to discuss their work, which will be on display.  </P> <P> Three South Bay Cinco de Mayo events are scheduled next Friday, the traditional  holiday date.  </P> <P> Lawndale senior citizens will be able to enjoy Mexican food and entertainment  by a kitchen band, which makes music with kazoos and utensils. The luncheon  will take place at the Prairie Avenue Community Center, 15331 Prairie Ave.,  from noon to 2 p.m. Donation is $1.25. Advance reservations are suggested and  can be made by calling 973-4321, Ext. 143.  </P> <P> Torrance will have a Cinco de Mayo teen dance from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. at the  Recreation Center, 3341 Torrance Blvd. A snack bar will serve Mexican foods,  and 12 pinatas will be given as door prizes. The dance will be open to sixth-  through eighth-graders who are members or guests of the city Co-Rec Club. The  cost at the door is $3 for members and $5 for guests who are not members.  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach also will stage a Cinco de Mayo teen dance for seventh- and  eighth-graders who attend city schools. The dance will be held from 7 to 10  p.m. at Manhattan Heights Community Center, 1600 Manhattan Beach Blvd.  Admission will be $5 at the door.  </P> <P> A parade, festivals and a concert will mark Cinco de Mayo on May 6.  </P> <P> The parade will step off at 10 a.m. in Gardena at Vermont Avenue and Gardena  Boulevard. It will end at Recreation Park at 158th Street and Normandie Avenue,  where Mexican dancing, music and food will be available until 3:30 p.m.  </P> <P> Folkloric dancing and a low-riders antique car show will highlight a  celebration from noon to 6 p.m. at the Wilmington Recreation Center, 325  Neptune Ave. There also will be food booths and arts and crafts.  </P> <P> Sister City committees in Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach will join in a public  Cinco de Mayo festival, with food and traditional Mexican dancing, from 6 to 8  p.m. at the Knights of Columbus Hall, 215 Avenue I, Redondo Beach.  </P> <P> In Hermosa Beach, another holiday celebration will include the appearance of  Tito Puente and the Latin Jazz All Stars in concert May 6 at 8 p.m. at the  Hermosa Civic Theatre, 710 Pier Ave. Reserved seats are $25 and information is  available at 318-3452.  </P> <P> Manhattan Beach will have a Cinco de Mayo dance for adults on May 19 from 8 to  11 p.m. at Joslyn Community Center, 1601 Valley Drive. Admission at the door is  $4.  </P> <P> Finally, Inglewood will salute Latino cultures with its annual Hispanic Fiesta  on May 21 from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Rogers Park, 400 W. Beach St. An outgrowth  of the city's previous Cinco de Mayo observance, the fiesta was established  three years ago. Flags from six countries -- Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador,  Cuba, Nicaragua and Costa Rica -- and from Puerto Rico will fly over the  festival, which will feature Latino music, Mexican cowboys, soccer and  volleyball tournaments, food from many countries, and pinatas, puppets and  storytelling for the children.  </P> <P> Janice Morimoto, administrative assistant in the city Recreation and Community  Services Department, said attendance last year was 7,000. "This has grown into  a huge fiesta." Gerald Faris  </P></p>

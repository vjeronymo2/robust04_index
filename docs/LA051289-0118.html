			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHOICES AND COSTS IN HEALTH CARE  </P> <P> Your article on health insurance touched briefly on a few important issues  dealing with the health insurance industry. I would briefly like to address one  of the concepts discussed. Health insurance shoppers should acquire the most  reasonably priced plan that yields the coverage that an individual or family  requires, yet these people should always expect to pay more in premiums than  they receive in benefits.  </P> <P> The idea of all insurance is not to get your money's worth. Insurance is  designed to protect us from rare and unusual circumstances which could  financially ruin an individual or a family. I believe most people purchasing  life, automobile, home, fire, liability, and earthquake insurance hope they  never have to collect on their policies. It is generally accepted that we will  pay large sums of money to corporations for protection that we will hopefully  never use.  </P> <P> For some strange reason, our society feels health insurance is different. The  whole concept of the insurance industry is based on the idea that many people  will pay premiums for the benefit of the few who will collect. Why then do many  people over-utilize their health insurance plans if significant roadblocks  (deductibles, co-payments, long waits for appointments) are not put in their  way? Without these barriers, many people feel it is their right to utilize  their policies for many self-limited and simple problems such as colds, flu,  minor strains and sprains, etc.  </P> <P> The individual's decision in choosing a health care plan depends on his/her  needs and expectations, but we must remember that the system is designed so  that we will not get what we pay for! For an individual, I can only recommend  trying to choose the health care coverage which is best suited to his/her  personality and needs in the event of a significant illness. Remember that if a  plan looks "too good to be true," like most things in life, it probably is.  </P> <P> KENNETH A. SCHILD, M.D.  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

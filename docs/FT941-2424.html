			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: Media The media sector has been wafted higher on a breeze of good news over the past year, outperforming the market by 26 per cent. The promise of an upturn in advertising spend, the high operational gearing of many companies, television bids, and racy headlines about the wonders of multimedia have fuelled demand for media stocks. But the rise has been somewhat indiscriminate. It now appears there are some worrying cross-currents in the wind for printed as opposed to electronic media stocks. Recent media groups to have reported, such as Reed Elsevier and Mirror Group Newspapers, have seen little or no top line sales growth. Big paper producers, such as Arjo Wiggins Appleton, MoDo, and SCA have also been talking excitedly about the possibility of pushing prices higher. Demand for paper is increasing as Europe's economies claw their way out of recession. The pick-up in UK advertising has already been translated into fatter newspapers. Merchants are restocking in the belief that the paper cycle has turned. Utilisation rates in many paper mills seem set to climb to more than 90 per cent. Fine papers for magazines have already experienced strong price rises this year. Newsprint prices, too, appear to be pushing upwards - or, at least, discounts are being reduced. Many publishers have locked into fixed price contracts for newsprint for months ahead. But those companies which are more reliant on circulation than advertising revenue could yet experience a nasty margin squeeze. It is time to pick media stocks more selectively.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 13 KYODO -- Foreign Minister Koji  Kakizawa on Friday [13 May] sought the cooperation of his  cabinet colleagues to meet strong U.S. and European Union  demands for Japan's greater deregulation efforts in "visible"  form, officials said. He made the request at the first meeting  of ministers concerned with deregulation.    The United States and EU are asking for the removal or  relaxation of seven types of government regulations, including  those concerning the Large-Scale Retail Stores Law and the  management of public and private pension funds. Their demands  also include more relaxed building standards and electrical  goods standards to promote the international harmonization of  standards.    The ministers are expected to meet again early next week as  some ministers such as construction minister were not present at  the first meeting, the officials said.</p>

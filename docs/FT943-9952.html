			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / The Markets: Seeking synergies with the networks - Global Investor Ted Turner, the boss of Cable News Network, never lets the world forget that he could be a contender. Last week, attending the Goodwill Games in St Petersburg, he stirred the bid fever surrounding CBS, the US television network, by declaring that he might try to buy it. Or, indeed, he added, one of its two rivals, ABC and NBC. It is curious that, if seriously interested, he would talk up the value of his target. But Mr Turner is given to startling pronouncements about the future of the media business. Five years ago he shocked a conference of European television grandees by prophesying that Britain's two satellite operators, Sky and BSB, could not survive with rival, incompatible systems of customer equipment. Then, he proved prescient: the two merged shortly afterwards. But now? Put bluntly, why would anyone want a US television network? Easy, say many analysts. 'It's a wonderful business,' according to Mr David Londoner, media guru at Wertheim Schroder in New York. He estimates that CBS churns out some Dollars 350m of free cash a year; indeed, to consume its much criticised cash pile, the network has turned to buying back its shares. If network revenues are above expectations - and analysts predict that advertising is now picking up with the resumption of economic growth - most of that bonanza drops to the bottom line. Bid speculation has also been stirred by imminent regulatory change. Under the 1971 'financial interest-syndication' regulations, networks have been barred from producing much of their own material, apart from news, and from participating in the lucrative 'syndication' markets - selling re-run programming to local stations. The lifting of the ban next November will allow a wider range of companies to own networks and to achieve synergies previously inaccessible, Wall Street analysts argue. Companies which might be tempted to acquire a network include Walt Disney, Tele-Communications Inc and CNN, they say. However, there are reasons to be sceptical of this pitch about the networks' attractions. In many ways, the networks are the poor cousins of US television, particularly compared to local stations. Although in the ferocious, battle between the three networks for ratings, each has held the top slot at some point in its life, none can claim a secure hold on that position, in contrast to some local stations which sustain a dominant share of their market for years. That is one reason why network operating profit margins, even in a good year, tended to hover around 10 per cent, compared with the 60 per cent which some local stations achieve. Another is that the industry's evolution has left the networks with an unattractive share of its risk and rewards. Although the huge cost of new programming is spread over the networks, local stations, cable, and the production companies themselves, the networks pay the largest slice, and bear the lion's share of the risk that it will fail. Mr Al Gottesman, analyst at Paine Webber, argues that 'the industry is not structured to maximise profits at the network level'. Mr Gottesman, who has distilled from his long experience of the industry a refreshing scepticism, believes that it is not just the fin-syn rules which have made those rewards unachievable. The networks, he argues, have often been employed by their owners 'for some grander purpose' besides the pursuit of advertising. NBC, in its earliest days as the National Broadcasting Corporation, 'was designed to make people buy radio sets', he says. '(Local) stations in the main have a history of being run just for financial results, although some never quite got it together. But there are no networks which have been run that way.' Undoubtedly, there would be attractive cost savings from some of the partnerships which have recently been mooted; Ted Turner, for example, has estimated that he could save at least Dollars 50m a year by merging the news operations of CBS and CNN. But the danger is that potential bidders are putting too much weight on a new grand strategy: to use the networks as captive distributors of programming. That vertical integration could prove misconceived: the new entity may be worth less than the sum of the parts. It would be astonishing if the programming partner did not try to force programmes onto the network which the network would not freely choose, at a cost to ratings and advertising. The new group might also fail to make the most of the value of its programming, if it no longer peddled it as aggressively to competing buyers. Given those risks, the chance to enter production may be a quagmire from which regulation has, to date, protected the networks. Many argue that these pitfalls could be avoided with tough management, which would keep a measure of independence between the two arms. But harvesting all the possible synergies between two huge, complex organisations, while incurring none of the disadvantages, is notoriously difficult. It is hard to believe that management could forever triumph over such pressures. The media mergers of the past decade have given plenty of reason to be suspicious that, despite the rhetoric, such synergies frequently never appear. You do not need to be cynical to conclude that media tycoons are often poor at maximising returns to shareholders. Many, in retrospect, appear more interested in size or newspaper headlines than in shareholder profit; (you might, in fact, use that as the distinction between an ordinary chairman and a tycoon). Ted Turner may not be wrong in his reckoning that CBS will be taken over. The question is whether it is really worth doing so, particularly for the reasons suggested by some analysts - and tycoons.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL RETURN IN LOCAL CURRENCY TO 4/8/94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               ---------- % change over period -------------------------                  US     Japan     Germany     France     Italy      UK  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Week         0.08      0.04        0.10       0.10      0.16    0.09   Month        0.39      0.17        0.42       0.46      0.69    0.42   Year         3.69      3.03        6.06       5.94      8.56    5.56  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 3-5 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Week         0.88     -0.55        0.27       0.12      0.58    0.34   Month        1.28     -0.50        1.04       1.36      0.55    0.73   Year         0.73      3.35        4.93       3.21      5.89    1.70  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds 7-10 year  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Week         1.30     -1.00        0.68       0.31      1.33    0.86   Month        1.99     -0.86        1.78       3.06      0.75    1.80   Year        -1.57      2.25        2.73       0.85      4.46   -0.17  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Equities  ----------------------------------------------------------------------   Week          1.0       2.2         2.6        2.2       2.1     1.9   Month         3.2      -0.9         5.8       11.5       4.8     6.6   Year          5.0       0.1        16.4        6.3      19.3    11.5  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Cash &amp; Bonds - Lehman Brothers.

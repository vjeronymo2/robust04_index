			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Zhou Shaoping (0719 1421 1627) and Feng Xiuju </F> (7458 4423 5468)]    [Text] Bern, 24 Jan (XINHUA) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the  Chinese National People's Congress Standing Committee, held  talks with Gret Haller, president of the Swiss Federal Assembly  National Council, this morning.    During the talks, Haller said: Switzerland and China are far  apart geographically and have different cultural backgrounds.  Therefore, it is very important for their parliaments to conduct  exchanges.    Haller had visited China in 1976. She said: Despite its  huge population, China has satisfied the needs of its people for  clothing, food, shelter, and transportation; it has achieved  fruitful results in social security. She expressed her  admiration for the tremendous achievements scored by China.    Qiao Shi briefed Speaker Haller on China's economic  development.    Qiao Shi said: China's rural economic reform has brought  tremendous changes to the countryside. Subsequent urban reform  also promoted fast urban economic development and yielded great  results. He indicated: It is possible that China will realize,  ahead of schedule, the strategic objective of economic  development it aims to achieve by the turn of the century.    He said: China will deepen reform nationwide and open wider  to the outside world. Qiao Shi said emphatically: Only by  maintaining stability at home and safeguarding peace  internationally can China develop its economy and its people  enjoy more political and economic freedoms. To maintain  political stability, China still needs to strengthen its legal  system.</p>

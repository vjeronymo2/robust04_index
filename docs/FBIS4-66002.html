			<p>BFN     [Text] Cyprus wants to contribute as much as possible to  improving security and stability in Europe and looks forward to  a further strengthening of its relations with Europe, and  particularly with the European Union.    This was stressed today by Foreign Minister Alekos  Mikhailidhis during his speech at a conference on stability in  Europe that is being held in Paris.    Referring to the Cyprus issue, the foreign minister stressed  that for 20 years Cyprus has lived the tragic results of the  lack of strong mechanisms to prevent expansionism and punish  violations of international law. He also said that Cyprus is an  example of a violation of borders and incitement of minority  problems to facilitate expansionist designs.</p>

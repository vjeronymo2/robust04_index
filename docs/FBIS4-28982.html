			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- A seminar of pressmen  took place in Pyongyang on the lapse of 30 years since the dear  leader Comrade Kim Chong-il began to work in the Central  Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea.    The speakers said the dear leader, with a deep insight into  the great role of news media in the revolutionary struggle, has  attached particular importance to the publication and  information services and led them since he began his work in the  party Central Committee.    They said the undying feats performed by him in guiding the  publication and information services are that he provided a  great guideline for the building of revolutionary news media of  the working class by putting forward a chuche-based idea and  theories on the publication and information services, kindled  the flames of revolutionization of newspapers, news services and  publications and established a revolutionary work system of the  press media.    They pointed out that at a time when news media of some  countries have been reduced to guides on the frustration of  socialism and their return to capitalism, giving in to the  bourgeois ideological offensive of the imperialists and  reactionaries, the news media of the DPRK are serving as  triumphant drumbeats in the noble struggle to resolutely defend  the party and the leader and safeguard and glorify the socialist  bastion under the banner of the chuche idea. They added that  this is entirely results of the wise guidance of the dear leader  who put forward a great chuche-based programme of the press and  led the struggle to carry it into reality.</p>

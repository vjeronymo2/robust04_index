			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Debt owed to Troubleshooter Sir, It was perhaps inevitable that a post-mortem would be done on the Troubleshooter companies (Management: 'Toil and trouble', June 1); and equally inevitable, so-and-so's law being what it is, that it should coincide with the nadir of the recession. However, in the original programme there was something missing from Sir John Harvey-Jones's otherwise excellent dissections of the companies concerned, which left one with an uneasy feeling that, while, for instance, the 'human' side was marvellously covered, hard, intuitive gut-feel for the all-important financial aspects of running a business was less in evidence. Which is perhaps why the outcome, two years later, is what it is. If Sir John's prime aim was to make business, in the common perception, generally more acceptable then he succeeded beyond all expectations; the programmes are still being talked about and a considerable debt of gratitude is due to him on that account alone.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Luanda is on the verge of social unrest. The people  are discontent because of the shortage of basic commodities for  their survival. This atmosphere of instability is being caused  by elements belonging to the government police, and outlaws  armed by the government, who continue to raid the Boavista food  warehouses near the port of Luanda. These warehouses belong to  Lebanese businessmen who were brutally harassed by the  government police recently.    Mario Paiva from the South African Radio said the turbulent  situation experienced in Luanda presently is intolerable. He  said one bag of flour is already costing 1.2 million kwanzas,  while imported beer costs 500,000 new kwanzas. In the face of  this situation, Luanda residents will experience a very  difficult period in the coming days.</p>

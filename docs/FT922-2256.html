			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / Political Notebook: Less heat, some light RAYS OF light have begun to replace some of the intense heat in the Conservative party generated by the Maastricht accords. Mr John Major's return from Rio has prompted more sober reflection among potential rebels on the wisdom of denigrating an agreement once hailed as a personal triumph for their leader. The more precocious of the new intake of Tory MPs have been reminded by the party whips of how dull life on the back benches can become after 10 or 15 years. The two dozen or so hardened Euro-sceptics have not changed their minds. They never will. But many of those who happily signed up to last week's synthetic rebellion are having second thoughts. Of course it may not last. If the Irish vote against, there will be no shortage of Tories ready to dance on the grave of the deal struck by their prime minister. Mr Major will be faced then with rebuilding from scratch the fragile complexes of compromises with his own party and with Britain's European partners he constructed after Margaret Thatcher's downfall. There would be no certainty that he could again reconcile the federalist ambitions of European colleagues with the instinctive nationalism of his party. Whichever way the Irish vote goes, the Tory anti-federalists at Westminster will make mischief when Mr Major acquiesces in the reappointment of Mr Jacques Delors at the Lisbon summit. But if the Irish forsake the Danish option, Mr Major will be able to ride out such turbulence. He will win a breathing space to map out a strategy for the British presidency to restore his grip on his party without risking his claim to have returned Britain to the heart of Europe. His starting point remains that Britain is better off with the Maastricht accords than without them. Ministers do not really believe their public claims that the accords represented a triumph for decentralisation over federalism. Their private assessment is that Maastricht was a draw - that Britain managed to defer until the next conference in 1996 the most difficult arguments about the distribution of power within the community. But Mr Major bought time. The choice he managed to finesse in December - was Britain's place at the core or on the periphery of Europe? - would return with a vengeance if Maastricht collapsed. Ironically, Mr Norman Lamont, one of the Cabinet's less committed Europeans, would be among those with most to lose. For a day or two, the chancellor appeared to be quietly celebrating the Danish result. Now he is more circumspect. It is perhaps no accident that the apparent change of heart coincides with a worrying Whitehall assessment of the possible Franco-German reaction to the collapse of EMU. What, some ministers are asking, would Britain do if Paris persuaded Bonn and the others among the original six to bypass formal treaty changes by simply locking irrevocably their exchange rates in the ERM? Mr Lamont could keep sterling outside such a fixed system but he would pay a high price in terms of British interest rates and the pace of economic recovery. The stark choices would not be confined to EMU. The collapse of the treaty on political union might undermine decisively efforts to ensure that Franco-German plans for a joint military force do not detach Europe from the US. So, Ireland permitting, Mr Major intends to press on with efforts to bring Denmark back into the fold. There will be no rush to a confrontation with Tory doubters. Ministers now refer to ratification during the first half of next year - during the Danish presidency. But Mr Major's hope is that the formula to change Danish minds could have the same effect on Tory doubters. The talk is of addenda to Maastricht that would commit the 12 not only to a much tighter definition of Community responsibilities and to more intergovernmental co-operation but also to an acceleration of preparations for enlargement. There is much that could go wrong even if the the Irish endorse the treaties. But his strong track record suggests that Mr Major has a fighting chance of persuading his party that by staying on the inside he can come up with a deal that is good enough for the Danes and even better for the Tories.</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Refinancing would take Cranbrook private THE MERCHANT Navy Officers' Pension Fund will take control of Cranbrook Electronic Holdings, the USM-traded distributor of electronic components, under emergency refinancing proposals put forward by the board yesterday. The proposals require shareholders, including several institutions, to write off their equity investments to a large degree. The share quote would also be cancelled. Following the refinancing, which would include the injection of more than Pounds 1m of new equity capital, the pension fund will own 103.8m new shares, or 99.3 per cent of Cranbrook's new equity. Existing shareholders, other than the pension fund, will end up with 716,524 new shares, representing the remaining 0.7 per cent equity stake in the new private company. The package, subject to shareholders approval, was made necessary by Cranbrook's deteriorating financial position which was blamed on 'extremely difficult trading conditions'. National Westminster Bank considered requesting the appointment of a receiver in December. However, that move was forestalled by the pension fund, which owns a 27.4 per cent stake, and all of the company's 9 per cent partly convertible loan stock agreeing to provide Cranbrook with a total of Pounds 150,000 in secured loans.</p>

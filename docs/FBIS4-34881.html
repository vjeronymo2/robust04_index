			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telepress" newscast] </F>   [Text] Today in Oslo, Norway, government and URNG  [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] representatives signed  an agreement that establishes the foundations for the creation  of the Truth Commission. The agreement underscores the need to  promote a culture of harmony among Guatemalans, and it  establishes that one of the commission's goals will be to  establish, with impartiality and equality, responsibility for  human rights violations perpetrated as a result of the internal  armed conflict.    During a visit to Roosevelt Hospital today, President Ramiro  de Leon Carpio expressed satisfaction over the signing of the  agreement with the URNG, whereby the Truth Commission will be  established.    [Begin De Leon recording] A few hours ago, an agreement was  signed; it is among the many steps that have been taken,  starting with the national peace plan presented by the  government.    As you know, the national peace plan consists of three  parts:  reconciliation; the solution of the Guatemalan people's economic  and social needs or, in other words, the struggle against  poverty; and third, the conclusion of the internal armed  conflict.    Regarding the first part -- reconciliation and the  establishment of a permanent forum for peace -- we agreed to  form a temporary assembly of civilian representatives. This  assembly will be headed by Monsignor Rodolfo Quezada Toruno.  With regard to the second part, we are making great efforts to  combat poverty, and when the internal armed conflict ends, we  will face a new challenge -- the biggest challenge of all --  which will be the elimination of the injustices and economic and  social circumstances that are hurting the Guatemalan people.  Regarding the third part, I am very pleased to say that  starting this year, based on the national peace plan we  presented to Guatemala and the international community, we have  fulfilled all of the points.    In January, we signed the framework agreement, which opened  this new phase of the process. In the framework agreement, both  sides agreed to sign a peace agreement this year. Subsequently  in March, we took a big step forward by signing the General  Human Rights Agreement, from which emerged the Commission for  Historic Clarification [Comision de Esclarecimiento Historico --  CEH]. This is a very significant agreement, because in the past  human rights had hindered the peace process. We also signed the  agreement on immediate international verification, which is  another big step forward.    Today is a historic day for Guatemala because, believe me,  never before have we encountered such an inherently complex  matter. Today's event is a significant step that truly brings us  closer to peace. Before this, we signed a schedule that clearly  outlines each phase -- phases we are fulfilling. The  international community is pleased with the administration's  true political resolve and also with the resolve of the  Guatemalan Army, which has unquestionably played an important  role in this matter, not only because it is directly involved,  but also because of the issues that directly affect the  institution.    In this case I can say that we are adhering to the schedule  and that a historic step was taken today in Oslo on the issue of  displaced people, which also was a big step forward. This is  perhaps the greatest and most gratifying event for us. I must  tell you that the agreement under which the Commission for  Historic Clarification will be established has certain  characteristics. In the first place -- and this is fundamental  -- it has been established that this commission must explain  possible human rights violations in detail, but its  recommendations and reports will not personalize responsibility  or be used to initiate legal proceedings.    This is the main issue, I believe, because it is in keeping  with the entire philosophy of the agreement. The document does  not advocate revanchism; on the contrary, from the very outset  it calls for an end to the armed conflict, thereby establishing  the foundations for peaceful coexistence with respect for human  rights in Guatemala. It underscores that it is necessary to  promote a culture of harmony and mutual respect that will  eliminate every form of revenge and retribution. This is the  central philosophy of this agreement, and it is an essential  condition for firm and lasting peace.    The CEH was not agreed to intensify our pain or to  constantly  make us look over our shoulders. Anyone who constantly looks  over his shoulder can easily trip and fall. The purpose of the  commission is to strengthen peace and make it lasting.  Meanwhile, another of the agreement's main goals is the  objective of equitable and impartial clarification of human  rights violations and violence that took place over a number of  years during the internal armed conflict.    As for the formation of the CEH, the news agencies have  already informed you how we agreed to do this. The UN secretary  general will be asked to appoint the current peace talks  mediator as a member of the commission. A citizen of  irreproachable standing, and one who is approved by both sides,  will be appointed by the mediator. Finally, an academician will  also be selected by the mediator, in conjunction with the two  sides, from a list of three candidates proposed by university  rectors.    The commission will be installed and will begin to function  on the day the firm and lasting peace agreement is signed. It  will work for six months and can be extended for an additional  six months. This deadline is deemed to be sufficient to conduct  an investigation and issue a report. This means that within no  more than a year following the firm and lasting overall peace  agreement, the commission will present its report.    I must stress that the commission will prepare its report  within the established period, but, perhaps, the main issue is  that we have agreed on a central philosophy that opposes revenge  and retribution; on the contrary, it seeks reconciliation,  forgiveness, and a new phase in Guatemala by way of a commission  that will prepare a report that will prevent us from again  experiencing or suffering the violence of the past. It is clear  that the commission has duties that prevent the personalizing of  responsibilities or taking legal action. During the course of  this period we will find the mechanisms with which to make an  agreement possible. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251) and </F> XINHUA reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yin Hongzhu  (1438 7703 4376)]    [Text] Beijing, 14 Jun (XINHUA) -- A national education  conference convened by the CPC Central Committee and State  Council opened today. Party and state leaders including Jiang  Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji, and Hu Jintao attended  today's meeting. Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC  Central Committee and state president delivered an important  speech. On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State  Council, Premier Li Peng made a report on the situation in  education.    The current national conference is an important meeting  being  held by the CPC Central Committee and State Council under the  new situation in which China is accelerating the establishment  of a socialist market economic structure and the modernization  drive. Under the guidance of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the party's  basic line, the main tasks of the conference are to implement  the guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee; further carry out the strategy of giving  priority to the development of education; mobilize the whole  party and entire society to seriously implement the "Outline of  the Reform and Development of China's Education"; and struggle  for realization of the goals of China's reform and the  development of education in the 1990's.    In his speech, Jiang Zemin pointed out: Since the Third  Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, under the  leadership of party committees and governments at various levels  and with the hard work of the broad masses of educational  workers, China's education work has developed rapidly;  educational reform has expanded gradually; and great  achievements have been made in education. This has raised  quality, cultivated a vast number of capable people, and made  important contributions to national economic construction,  scientific and technological progress, and social development.  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and State Council, Jiang  expressed high respect for the broad masses of teachers and  educational workers who have been working hard on the  educational front, and to people of various circles in society  who have shown concern for and supported education.    Jiang Zemin said: The CPC Central Committee and Comrade Deng  Xiaoping have always attached importance to education, and have  considered it a fundamental issue linked with the socialist  modernization drive and the history and fate of socialism, when  formulating an overall strategy for the building of socialism  with Chinese characteristics. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  expositions on education are the theoretical basis for our party  in formulating principles and policies for education in the new  period; and have provided us with a powerful ideological weapon  and orientation for the reform and development of education.  Comrades of the whole party, especially leading cadres at  various levels, must conscientiously understand Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's thinking on education when they study his theory on  building socialism with Chinese characteristics. Like Comrade  Deng Xiaoping, they should attach importance to education from  the high plane of strategy and promote the reform and  development of education.    Jiang Zemin emphatically pointed out: In our country  with a population of nearly 1.2 billion, and relatively  inadequate resources and comparatively backward economic and  cultural [wen hua 2429 0553] conditions, what must we rely on in  realizing the grand goal of the socialist modernization drive?  A decisive thing is to shift the focus of economic construction  to the track of relying on scientific and technological  progress, and of raising the quality of our laboring people. We  must truly give priority to the development of education and  place it in a strategic position; and strive to raise the level  of ideology, ethics, science, and culture of the whole nation.  This plan is of fundamental importance in achieving our  country's modernization.    Jiang Zemin asked leading cadres at various levels to fully  understand the need to vigorously develop education, speed up  the training of people for the socialist modernization drive,  and raise the quality of ideology, ethics, science, and  education. He said: This is a necessary requirement in  implementing the party's basic line, and is also a necessary  requirement for unswervingly adhering to the party's basic line  for 100 years. Only when we promote education can we  fundamentally strengthen our country's comprehensive strength,  and win strategic initiative in the fierce world competition.  Only when we raise one generation of successors after another  with high ideals, moral integrity, a good general education, and  a sense of discipline, who will dedicate themselves to the cause  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, can we  guarantee a long period of stability. In the entire course of  building socialist modernization, we must unswervingly and  always adhere to the strategic policy of giving priority to the  development of education.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: In order to accelerate the reform  and development of education, we must fully implement the  "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education" formulated  by the CPC Central Committee and State Council. This is not  just important for various education departments but is also  important for the whole party and entire society. Party  committees and governments at various levels must effectively  strengthen their leadership over education work, formulate  specific measures for developing education in light of actual  local conditions, be meticulous in making plans, and implement  the measures and plans with unified arrangements.    Touching on the issue of respecting teachers and attaching  importance to education, Jiang Zemin said: The hope of  revitalizing the nation lies in education and the hope of  revitalizing education depends on teachers. Teachers are the  engineers of the people's soul. A teachers' job is noble and  hard, and they should be respected by the whole party and entire  society. In showing respect for teachers and attaching  importance to education, leading cadres at various levels must  take the lead, especially senior leading cadres. We must  seriously implement the "Teachers' Law," safeguard teachers'  lawful rights and interests, raise their remuneration according  to relations, and create necessary conditions for their working,  studying, and living conditions.    Jiang Zemin also pointed out that schools of different kinds  at various levels should fully implement the party's policy on  education, adhere to the socialist orientation in running  schools, and strive to cultivate new people with "high ideas,  moral integrity, a good general education and sense of  discipline"; and enable them to develop morally, intellectually,  and physically. In light of the new situation and problems  emerging in the course of reform and construction, we should  constantly strengthen and improve ideological and political work  and ethical education in schools. Jiang said the whole society  should show concern for and protect the healthy growth of  students and join efforts to create a favorable environment for  cultivating new people.    Jiang Zemin especially mentioned the issue of integrating  education with production and labor. He said: This issue has  been clearly defined in the "Outline of Reform and Development  of Education." It is an important component part of our  education policy because the integration of education with  production and labor is a basic measure in adhering to a  socialist orientation in education.    Jiang Zemin stressed: One of our basic national  conditions is that we are developing education on a large scale  under a situation in which the country is rather backward  economically. Basing ourselves on this reality, we must deepen  educational reform in order to make our educational structure  and system conform to the needs of the development of a  socialist market economy and all-around social progress. No  matter what financial difficulties we face, we must be willing  to invest in education in order to ensure success in the system  of nine-year compulsory education, because this project will lay  the foundation for raising the quality of the whole nation. The  masses of educators in educational departments and schools  should further emancipate their minds, seek truth from facts,  vigorously explore new ways to develop education and establish a  new educational structure under socialist market economic  conditions, and strive to build a socialist educational system  with Chinese characteristics.    In conclusion, Jiang Zemin stressed: It is a very glorious  and arduous task to fulfill the grand objective of China's  educational reform and development in the 1990's. Through our  efforts over the past four decades, our educational undertaking  has developed considerably, particularly in the past 15 years  since the introduction of reform and opening up to the outside  world. We have accumulated valuable experiences in educational  reform, and a contingent of tens of millions of teachers has  taken shape. All this has laid a sound foundation for  educational reform and future development. The Central  Committee believes that under the guidance of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics and the party's basic line, the Chinese nation's  educational undertaking will surely continue to develop and  prosper so long as we give strategic priority to developing  education, seize opportunities, and thoroughly implement the  "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education."    In his report entitled: "Let Us Mobilize and Vigorously  Implement the `Outline of the Reform and Development of  Education,'" Li Peng affirmed China's educational achievements  scored since the introduction of reform and opening up to the  outside world. He said: At present, China's reform and opening  up to the outside world and its socialist modernization drive  have entered a new period of development. Fundamentally  speaking, economic construction and social progress must rely on  science, technology, and education. To meet the needs of  establishing a socialist market economic structure and to take  on the development opportunities and challenges in the 21st  century, we must further deepen educational reform, accelerate  educational development, raise the quality of the whole nation,  and train cross-century personnel for realizing our strategic  objective of economic and social development. This is an urgent  task confronting us.    Li Peng said: The "Outline of the Reform and Development of  Education," promulgated by the CPC Central Committee and State  Council, is a programmatic document for the development of  education in China. To realize the development objectives set  in the "Outline," we must concentrate on fulfilling the  following tasks: First, efforts should be made to popularize  nine-year compulsory education and to basically eliminate  illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. This forms the  basic requirement for raising the quality of the whole nation  and is also the most important measure for developing education  in China in the days to come. This task is difficult to realize  in the countryside, particularly in frontier areas, remote  areas, and poor areas. Governments at all levels should help  these areas enforce compulsory education. In the course of  doing so, they should integrate agricultural science with  education in light of local conditions and make this a  fundamental measure for helping poor areas free themselves from  poverty and become well-off. Second, vigorous efforts should be  made to develop vocational and adult education. In accordance  with the need for primary and intermediate specialized personnel  and with the degree of popularization of basic education,  efforts should be made to divert graduates of elementary and  middle schools to vocational schools in a planned way. This is  the sure way to accelerate the heightening of laborers' quality  and to invigorate the economy. Third, efforts should be made to  develop higher education by focusing on raising the quality of  education and raising efficiency in running schools. Through  reform, we should mainly rely on a new way of developing higher  education to an appropriate scale with a reasonable structure  and strive to achieve a marked improvement in quality and  efficiency.    Li Peng said: We must deepen educational reform in an  all-around way to promote the development of education. The  establishment of the socialist market economic structure has  created an opportunity and motive force for educational reform  and development, but at the same time it also calls for  accelerating the pace of educational reform and the integration  of education with economic development in order to gradually  build a socialist educational system with Chinese  characteristics. We should readjust the education structure by  giving priority to raising the quality of laborers and to  vigorously developing vocational education. It must be clearly  understood that for a long period of time, an important and  urgent task of education in China is to vigorously develop  vocational education on the basis of popularizing nine-year  compulsory education. This is a fundamental method of training  a large number of applied personnel, a method which conforms to  the national conditions in China.    Li Peng said: It is necessary to reform the system of  running schools by gradually establishing a system in which the  government plays the central role in running them, and all walks  of life pool their funds to expand education. Basic education,  particularly compulsory education, should be run mainly by the  government. At the same time, enterprises, institutions, and  other social forces should be encouraged to run various types of  schools. Vocational and adult education should be mainly  undertaken by trades, enterprises, institutions, and social  organizations under government management, or they may be  undertaken jointly by social organizations and individual  citizens with the government's support. In higher education, we  will practice the system under which schools of higher learning  will mainly be run by the government while all sectors of  society will participate in joint efforts to expand such  education. We should straighten out the relationship among the  government, society, and schools in accordance with the  characteristics of various levels and types of education, and  establish a scientific management system. We should reform the  enrollment system in schools of higher learning, senior  secondary schools, secondary schools, as well as vocational  schools above the secondary level; and also reform their tuition  collection system and system of assigning jobs to graduates. We  should carefully draw up a reform program, strengthen propaganda  and ideological work, and properly handle the relationship  between reform and stability.    Li Peng pointed out: To develop education, we must expand  the contingent of teachers, and increase teachers' pay and  benefits. We should strive to run teachers' colleges well,  encourage outstanding students to enroll in teachers' colleges,  and also encourage graduates of such colleges to be happy in  taking teaching as their profession. Efforts should be made to  heighten teachers' ideological, professional, and teaching  standards.    In his report, Li Peng stressed: It is necessary to  strengthen and improve moral education in schools and heighten  their teaching quality. Faced with the new situation and new  requirements, we must effectively improve party leadership,  strengthen and improve moral education in schools, and strive to  explore new ideas for improving moral education under the new  situation so that the traditional virtues and glorious  traditions of the Chinese nation will be carried forward by the  younger generation in conjunction with the spirit of the times.    Li Peng pointed out: Party committees and governments at all  levels should strengthen their leadership over educational work  and strive to do solid work to expand education. He proposed  specific measures and requirements on increasing investment in  education, improving the system of raising educational funds  through various channels, upgrading teachers' social status and  wages, putting an end to the practice of not paying teachers on  time, and strengthening education-related legislation.    In conclusion, he called on party and government leaders at  all levels to give strategic priority to developing education  and to strive to fulfill the objectives and tasks set in the  "Outline of the Reform and Development of Education."    Today's conference was presided over by Vice Premier Li  Lanqing.

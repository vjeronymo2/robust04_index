This action is necessitated by the diminishing number of states applying for state formula-allocated monies, and the need to improve the delivery of services. This action allows for the establishment of a more competitive process to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> May 23, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Jeffrey C. Crandall at (202) 219&hyph;9105 (this is not a toll-free number). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to title IV, part C, of JTPA, the Secretary of Labor conducts programs to meet the employment and training needs of service-connected disabled veterans, veterans of the Vietnam era, and veterans who are recently separated from military service. The programs are administered through the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Veterans' Employment and Training, who conducts the programs through grants, contracts, and cooperative agreements with public agencies and private non-profit organizations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department of Labor (DOL) originally issued regulations at 20 CFR part 1005 to define specifically the manner in which the funds from this program would be disbursed. See 54 FR 39354 (September 26, 1980); and 48 FR 49198 (October 24, 1983). They provided for formula-based grants to States and required matching funds. However, the number of States applying for title IV&hyph;C formula grants has diminished and the Department has determined that a competitive methodology would more efficiently meet the needs of program participants. Program administration will be greatly enhanced as the result of the elimination of those regulations, by increasing competition and lowering administrative costs through larger grant awards. However, while this action removes those regulations, all specifications, special conditions,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> etc <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ., that were in effect with the award of existing grants are binding until completion of the grant activity, including information collection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Part 1005 (1993 ed.) identified the process used to provide grant funds to states for Federal training programs for veterans. A Solicitation for Grant Applications (SGA) will be developed and disseminated to eligible applicants for the title IV&hyph;C program. The formula-based annual grants process is replaced by a multi-year competitive grants process. This will result in fewer grants of greater dollar value, and will enable recipients of the grants to provide expanded services to eligible veterans. By having larger, competitive grants, services can be targeted to those eligible veterans most in need in areas of high impact, with greater customer satisfaction realized. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

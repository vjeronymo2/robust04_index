			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FERDINAND MARCOS DIES IN EXILE  </P> <P> In response to your editorial, it is unfortunate that The Times has contributed  to the relentless attack against a defenseless man. Not even with his death can  the forsaken man find peace.  </P> <P> As for President Corazon Aquino, her kind words are not enough to heal this  great injustice. Don't tell us that you know how it feels to lose a loved one.  Sure, her husband was killed, but no government prevented her from being at his  side, nor were her family members kept away at a time of crisis. And she was  not barred from burying her husband's remains at his rightful place, that is,  his homeland. Her case can hardly be compared to the Marcoses.  </P> <P> The simple truth is that Aquino's government is not interested in an end to the  great division in the Philippines. It is obvious that her action is  characterized by vindictiveness. Her action will never end the ongoing conflict  among the various factions.  </P> <P> Never has such cruelty been displayed by a supposedly democratic, civilized  government. Her saintly, benevolent image has been shattered. The world has  witnessed the true nature of this woman: stone-hearted, cruel and vindictive.  </P> <P> EMILIO MAKOY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

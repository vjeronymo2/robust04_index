			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ANN CONWAY: JORGENSEN'S PALS WANT A LIVELY FAREWELL  </P> <P> Her pal Dorothy Lamour is invited. And so are friends Sybil Brand, Martha Raye,  Kathryn Grayson, Gretchen Wyler and Rusty Warren. So is her attorney, Donald  Segretti. And so is John Hansen of Fullerton, the man who played her on the  silver screen.  </P> <P> About 270 of the late Christine Jorgensen's faithful are expected to assemble  at a secret south county locale June 11 to bid her farewell. Jorgensen, who  arched a zillion eyebrows when she was surgically changed from male to female  in 1952, died of cancer in San Clemente on May 3.  </P> <P> Hansen, who is going to the gathering with his wife, Sue, says he wants to  attend because Jorgensen "was a definite part of my life."  </P> <P> "She knew I was uncomfortable in the role," says Hansen, 37, who starred in  "The Christine Jorgensen Story" when he was 18. "And she was extremely kind.  Incredibly brave. She never left my side. I was extremely grateful." The movie  did poorly in the United States, says Hansen, now a real estate developer, but  it did big box office in Europe.  </P> <P> There will be no crepe-hanging at this bon voyage party. No brave flowers. No  torch songs. Not one tear, if Jorgensen's friend Dame Brenda Smith has her way.  "Christine didn't want anybody weeping and moaning," says the English-born  Smith. "She enjoyed her life and wants her friends to enjoy theirs." Skoal!  </P> <P> A trend begins?: Videotape invitations are being used to lure celebs and  corporate types to the Coca Cola/Ritz-Carlton Classic beginning June 9. And  they're working. So far, Robert Wagner, Jill St. John, Paul Anka, Cheryl Ladd,  Frankie Avalon, Elliot Gould and Telly Savalas have said oui to the private  weekend that will benefit the Ronald McDonald Camp Good Times program.  </P> <P> Jackie, oy: The zany author of the autobiographical "Jackie, Oy" opened his own  theater-district bistro, called Jackie Mason's (what else?), in Manhattan last  month with the likes of Malcolm Forbes, Donald Trump, Claire Trevor and Mikhail  Baryshnikov sampling its continental fare. And on June 12, the man himself will  be noshing with prominent locals on the kind of food they order (if they're  lucky) before sweeping into the Orange County Performing Arts Center. For  $1,000 each, supporters of the Jewish Senior Center of Orange County get to  converge at the Center Club and dine on, among other items too continental to  mention, Dover sole with truffle mousse and breast of pheasant with sun-dried  cherries. The piece de resistance? Chocolate pyramid cake embellished with  candy masks of tragedy and comedy (but of course). Tickets for Mason's  one-night-only sidesplitter are on sale to the public.  </P> <P> Let them eat cake -- and pate and crepes and . . . : Nothing like a little  junket to get a party going. Elizabeth Carr Tierney, chairwoman of the Newport  Harbor Art Museum blast that will commemorate the bicentennial of the French  Revolution on July 14, did some research for the celebration during a recent  trip to Paris. "In fact, I did a lot of research," said Tierney, a resident of  Santa Ana Heights, "peeking in department stores to see what kind of displays  and souvenirs they had." Tierney had hoped to bring some home to help decorate  the party site -- Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. But what she found was  mostly "red, white and blue ticky tack" -- such as men's briefs decorated with  guillotines.  </P> <P> So she asked Parisians what they do to celebrate Bastille Day. "They told me it  depends on which class you're in. And I thought, 'Things haven't changed much  since the revolution!' " Members of the working class dance in the streets and  enjoy fireworks and picnics in the park with their families, Tierney was told,  while members of the upper class dine formally behind closed doors.  </P> <P> For Tierney's crowd -- 1,400 can be accommodated -- there'll be jugglers,  bands, caricaturists, accordionists, violinists -- and food, glorious food, all  over the place, for everyone. Now that's class.  </P> <P> Looking ahead: It was a quote from Fluor Corp.'s David Tappan that did the  trick. In a December article in The Times about the Newport Harbor Art Museum,  Tappan said: "When the museum is dedicated 3 years from now, it will join South  Coast Repertory and the Performing Arts Center as the third leg of a cultural  triangle for Orange County." Community activist Ginny Smallwood read that and  wondered: Why doesn't the museum have support groups similar to those that  raise funds for the two theaters? The result: Visionaries, a support group that  will, it is hoped, number 500 women who will pay initiation fees of $1,000 and  annual dues of $500. The goal: to hand the museum a check for $500,000 when it  opens. The idea was introduced to a roomful of Orange County community  activists during a luncheon Thursday at the Four Seasons Hotel. Among those on  the Visionaries board are Smallwood, Judy Hemley, Mary Lou Hornsby, Jeanne  Tappan, Maria Crutcher, Judie Argyros, Marilyn Nielsen and Nora Hester.  </P> <P> On the town: Dr. Jonas Salk and his wife, Francoise Gilot (she was once married  to Pablo Picasso), visited Santa Ana on Saturday night and enjoyed dinner with  Salk's son, Peter, and his wife, Ellen Schreibman Salk. The Salks visited  Gustaf Anders restaurant, where Ellen's oil paintings are on exhibit.  </P></p>

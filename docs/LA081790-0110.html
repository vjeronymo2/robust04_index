			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRISIS IN THE PERSIAN GULF;  </P> <P> U.S. RADAR 'LOCKS ON,' AND IRAQI WARPLANES TURN TAIL  </P> <P> In what one called "a little cat and mouse," U.S. fliers said Thursday that  American pilots have locked on their weapons radar on Iraqi planes, which have  quickly turned and fled.  </P> <P> "They don't want to play with us," one crew chief said. "If I were in a Mirage  and an F-15 locked onto me, I'd get out of there fast, too."  </P> <P> When an American jet's weapons systems radar locks onto another plane, it means  the U.S. jet has found its target and communicated that to its missile.  </P> <P> The Iraqi pilot knows it, too, because his plane carries a warning system  something like the "fuzz buster" radar used by some automobile drivers in  America to warn them that they're under the scrutiny of police radar.  </P> <P> Although the U.S. airmen declined to go into detail, there was no indication  that any of the encounters involved Iraqi planes attempting to intrude into  Saudi Arabian air space. The airmen suggested that the encounters occurred  during missions near the border with Kuwait.  </P> <P> Col. John McBroom, commander of the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing from Langley Air  Force Base in Virginia, refused to confirm the pilots' reports and said he had  instructed his airmen not to discuss any contact with Iraqi jets.  </P> <P> "I'm not going to get into our encounters," he said.  </P> <P> But McBroom did say he considers U.S. air power here far superior to Iraq's.  </P> <P> "We're not over here to go to war," McBroom said, "but we will finish one  quickly in the air."  </P> <P> Another officer in the unit and several crew chiefs said there have been  several instances in which weapons systems aboard U.S. F-15s locked onto the  Iraqis' French-made Mirage jets.  </P> <P> "One of my pilots told me they turn and run as soon as the radar locks on," one  crew chief said.  </P> <P> "There's been a little cat and mouse but when the weapons lock on, they're  gone," said another.  </P> <P> Asked again about the encounters, McBroom said: "All I'll do is remind you our  radar can lock on at a pretty good range. Beyond that you'll have to ask the  Iraqis."  </P> <P> He seemed to be suggesting that the episodes involved Iraqi planes flying well  within Kuwaiti airspace.  </P> <P> In Washington, Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon spokesman, said he had asked  military officials about the report but had received no information that would  enable him to confirm or deny the accuracy of the crew chiefs' remarks.  </P> <P> McBroom said the fighter unit felt somewhat vulnerable on the ground when it  arrived last week. But now it has received powerful ground protection from  other U.S. forces, including Patriot ground-to-air missile systems.  </P> <P> The unit has set up camp at a Saudi air base. It uses spare Saudi hangars,  maintenance garages and other facilities.  </P> <P> Ground rules for the pool of U.S. reporters flown here by the Pentagon prohibit  disclosure of the base's location, the number of planes and other weapons  systems or the names of non-command officers.  </P> <P> The men are living in Saudi barracks and schools. But a tent city is under  construction on the base, as is a portable hospital.  </P> <P> Heat is a big problem. The hospital is treating about 15 cases of heat stress a  day, Air Force officials said.  </P> <P> Interviews with the airmen were conducted between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. local  time, when temperatures already were approaching triple digits and the sun was  scorching.  </P> <P> One Air Force sergeant was taken to the hospital during the pool's visit for a  minor case of heat stress. He had been swinging a sledge hammer for several  hours helping to set up the tents.  </P> <P> McBroom said the Saudi base facilities are the best he has ever seen.  </P> <P> "The Saudis build everything big and everything right," he said.  </P> <P> McBroom and his crew chiefs and maintenance personnel said they have had very  few equipment problems associated with the heat. Most of the planes are being  kept outdoors in the heat because electronic systems sometimes have temporary  troubles when going from a cool to hot environment, McBroom said.  </P> <P> The Air Force has extensive stocks of missiles for the jets, and crews were  seen unloading boxes of 20-millimeter shells for their on-board guns as well.  </P></p>

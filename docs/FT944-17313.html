			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Random and arbitrary? As an investing member of several building societies, I was unaware that if my share account had not been open for two years, I would lose out on rewards or advantages that depositors (rather than shareholders) would get. I have received a letter from the Cheltenham and Gloucester building society telling me that, as my share account was not open by December 31 1992, I shall not qualify legally for payment in the distribution of the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid from Lloyds Bank. On the other hand, depositors qualify if their accounts were opened by March 31 1994. This appears to me to be a random and arbitrary decision. The letter from the C&amp;G resulted from a High Court action interpreting the legislation regarding take-overs of building societies. The decision to restrict payments to those who have been with the society for a minimum of two years is not without precedent and is certainly not random and arbitrary. You might wish to know that the C&amp;G has opened a telephone help-line which can be contacted on 0345-889 900 from 9am to 5pm Mondays to Fridays, and 9-1 on Saturdays.

All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

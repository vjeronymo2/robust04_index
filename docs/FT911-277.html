			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Small businesses still in recession, says CBI BRITAIN'S small businesses are still in the middle of a deep recession, with output plunging more quickly than at any time in the last decade, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The CBI says that a fall in orders between January and the end of April means that three-quarters of small businesses are now working below capacity. Manufacturers were expecting a decline in output early in the year, but the downturn was more severe than anticipated. Most companies say they expect the rate of deterioration in business to moderate during the next few months, echoing the CBI's most recent quarterly trends survey. Mr Tom O'Connor, chairman of the CBI's smaller firms council, said the latest survey confirmed that business was 'bumping along the bottom', with recovery some way off.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vytautas Petkevicius, chairman of the </F> Lithuanian Seimas National Security Committee, by Vladimiras  Zarovskis under the "Secrets of Special Services" rubric; in  Vilnius, date not given: "Let's Steal the Blueprint. But What  Shall We Do with It?"]    [Text] Vilnius -- Three years ago Vytautas Petkevicius was  really being threatened, but he was writing his stories and  novels. Today Petkevicius is chairman of the Lithuanian Seimas  National Security Committee, and not just a well-known writer  and storyteller. Vladimiras Zarovskis, our own correspondent in  the Lithuanian Republic, talked with Vytautas Petkevicius about  the KGB archives which have disappeared, a little about spies,  and a little more about corruption and crime in the Army, and  about the fact that people must not be deceived.    [Zarovskis] Why did you exchange a writer's desk for the  hectic Seimas and a chairman's uncomfortable chair?    [Petkevicius] I was one of the initiators of the Lithuanian  Democratic Labor Party's transformation into an opposition party  after March 1990. The party won the elections to the Seimas 18  months ago only because it was an opposition party. Only I did  not become a deputy on the party list but won in a single-seat  electoral district. As regards the National Security Committee,  the work on it is very interesting for me as a writer. At the  time of the Khrushchev thaw I wrote the novel "Of Bread, Love,  and the Rifle," which is a first-person narrative about postwar  Lithuania. My opponents set about proving that its hero -- who  was myself -- was an employee of the People's Commissariat for  Internal Affairs, a Chekist, etc. Therefore I had to prove that  all this was not so. I won that case even in court.    [Zarovskis] Right after March 1990 Lithuanian state security  became the province of right-wingers. How did they greet you,  who are very left-wing?    [Petkevicius] There was no such service. There were three  or four scatterbrains, with whom it was impossible to reach  agreement. National security had been broken up. Previously,  there had been very modern equipment in Lithuania. It was  squandered. They deliberately destroyed national security from  March 1990. Incompetent people who did not understand the  business were set up as leaders. One was a postgraduate  dropout, another did not even have secondary education, yet  another was a specialist in land improvement. Lithuania was  left without cover, and people descended on it and did what they  liked. Top-class specialists who had been trained to combat  foreign currency speculators, terrorists, and spies worked in  the old Lithuanian SSR [Soviet Socialist Republic] KGB. Little  by little we are vetting them and inviting them to work.    [Zarovskis] Your committee also monitors the Army.  Lithuanian newspapers write about purchases of Russian arms,  helicopters, and ships for Lithuania's army through some  Russian-Lithuanian front firms, which have done great harm to  the Republic.    [Petkevicius] I can refute nothing of what Lithuanian  newspapers have written about thefts, currency machinations, and  financial speculation in the Army, the Voluntary Territorial  Protection Service, and national security. Mass searches of  people engaged in buying weapons, right up to the former  minister of territorial protection, were carried out in  Lithuania recently. The parliament of independent Lithuania has  worked for three years without adopting a single law on the  Army, just a decision to create it. The Army itself does not  even have regulations, let alone a military doctrine. Imagine:  A person is recruited for the Army under civil legislation. If  he has sold an assault rifle or a pistol for drink, he cannot be  punished as a soldier or an officer but only as a civilian who  has lost a production tool. This is why so many weapons have  flowed into the criminal world. Moreover, even people with two  or three convictions have gotten into the power structures,  particularly the Voluntary Territorial Protection Service. We  have been forced to start recertification, to collect up the  rifles and carbines that they were keeping at home, and to  "test-fire" them. According to the rules, it is necessary to  have two spent cases from each gun in order to verify, if  necessary, whether it has been involved in a crime. But even  this has not been done in the three years that the Army and the  Voluntary Service have existed, and the number of murders  involving weapons is growing yearly.    The necessary civilian control over servicemen is now being  introduced. We have to combat irregular relationships,  thieving, and crime in the Army. It is offensive. I traveled  around the Republic with a commission, and we received Russian  Army installations which were clean, generally in order, and had  been prepared for handover, but our people came along, and two  months later it was impossible to find anything anymore.  Everything had been looted and smashed, and even the central  heating radiators had been taken. Is it really possible to do  this? We want to call these people to order -- and we will.    [Zarovskis] Every army has a so-called likely enemy. Does  Lithuania?    [Petkevicius] Ours is a small state, and we do not intend  and would not be able to fight anyone. The Lithuanian Army  already exists, and thousands of people serve in it, and it must  be disciplined and well armed. But it must be of such a size  that the people will be able to maintain it. It is needed for  support and the elimination of some conflicts. Our concept of  military doctrine is the Swiss one: resistance by the whole  people. If not with weapons, then through disobedience, etc.  We can be part of the NATO structure, for a company -- no more  -- to participate in international actions. Lithuania has  already subscribed to the NATO "Partnership for Peace" program,  but that is, rather, a political step.    [Zarovskis] What about the archives of the former Lithuanian  SSR KGB? They could be used both by Russia and by Lithuania  itself.    [Petkevicius] Some of the documents were burned in the inner  courtyard of the "Lithuanian SSR" KGB, and some were taken away  to Ulyanovsk and Tomsk. Negotiations for their return have been  going on for more than a year. I do not believe, however, that  we will live to see the day. Russia will not give up the  archives, since the state is interested in keeping its agents in  any republic of the former USSR, including Lithuania. They will  not be of any special use to us if they do return. In our  situation the declassification of these files could have most  dreadful consequences. In the times of Landsbergis' rule the  entire people shuddered, particularly the intelligentsia: Rogues  and adventurers had been admitted to the KGB archives, and they  had stolen their own files, picked up other people's, and then  started blackmailing them. Ten sacks of documents were stolen  in the space of two years, but we have found them. An archives  administration has been set up on our initiative, and a center  for the study of genocide and a special library for those who  wish to acquaint themselves with their own file are being set  up. Those who wish to can now find out the reason for being in  disfavor with the government, and we give answers to requests --  except, of course, for operational information. It will not be  possible to find out who "ratted" on them.    [Zarovskis] How will I be able to show gratitude to my  "friend"?...    [Petkevicius] In Lithuania everyone was rehabilitated at the  beginning of the nineties, including those who participated in  mass executions of Jews. We are now ashamed before the whole  world. The genocide center must work the same way as the  de-Nazification army in postwar Germany. This must be tackled  by jurists and historians, because we have had enough of  politicians poking about in this dirty business. They must not.  The use of such archives by politicians for political purposes  is criminal. In all democratic countries there is a deadline  for releasing documents, otherwise political vengeance is at  once followed by human vengeance -- which is ruinous for the  state and the people.    [Zarovskis] Are there many Lithuanian spies abroad -- in CIS  countries, for example?    [Petkevicius] Well, there may be some self-styled spies.  What is more, I will say that we have no such department as  intelligence at all. What intelligence can be gotten abroad?  So we steal some blueprint. What are we going to do with it?  Enterprises may engage in economic espionage, but even then  hardly at all.</p>

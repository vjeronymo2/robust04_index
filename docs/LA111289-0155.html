			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GRAND CHAMPIONS TENNIS AT RANCHO SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> LLOYD COMES OF AGE, ADVANCES TO FINAL  </P> <P> Age is a touchy subject for many people.  </P> <P> But John Lloyd has been welcoming the added years since he retired from the  Grand Prix tennis tour in 1986.  </P> <P> Lloyd craved to return to competition despite playing three short seasons with  the Los Angeles Strings.  </P> <P> Now, at 35, he's a rookie among the oldtimers at the 35-and-over Prudential  Bache Grand Champions event at the Rancho San Clemente Tennis Club.  </P> <P> "I was really looking forward to getting to 35," Lloyd said. "When I retired, I  didn't want to just drop off from being a professional tennis player."  </P> <P> Saturday, Lloyd survived a tough challenge from Sandy Mayer in the singles  semifinals to win, 6-3, 2-6, 7-5, and advance to the final.  </P> <P> Lloyd will play Hank Pfister, who defeated Bob Lutz of San Clemente, 6-4, 4-6,  6-0, at 1 p.m. today. In the five Grand Champions events in which he has  played, this is the fourth time that Lloyd has made the finals. He has won two  events.  </P> <P> Lloyd won the first set easily, but Mayer came back in the second. Mayer then  went ahead, 2-0, in the third set when Lloyd double-faulted on break point.  </P> <P> Lloyd then broke Mayer's serve to make it 2-1, but was down 15-40 in the next  game before rallying to win the match with strong serves.  </P> <P> "From that point on, I felt like I was in charge," Lloyd said.  </P> <P> Thirty minutes after defeating Mayer, Lloyd teamed with Dick Stockton in the  doubles, losing to Kim Warwick and Sherwood Stewart, 6-1, 6-4. Warwick and  Stewart will play Lutz and Mayer in the final.  </P> <P> For Lloyd, who resides in Pacific Palisades and coaches professional tennis  players, the Grand Champions is a chance to continue playing competitively  while picking up extra income. He also appreciates the low-key atmosphere at  these events. The tennis and the behavior is distinctly old-style, said Lloyd,  who was born in England.  </P> <P> It's a throwback to the days when the players weren't "bloody rude," on the  court, he said, and acted "the way they should."  </P></p>

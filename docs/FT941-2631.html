			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / International Company News: Metallgesellschaft plans action against sacked chief The supervisory board of Metallgesellschaft said yesterday it would take legal steps to seek damages against Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, the sacked chief executive of the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and industrial group. It will also take action against Mr Meinhard Forster, the former finance director. The supervisory board said the move followed an independent report into the events leading to the near collapse of the group - Germany's 14th largest industrial company - commissioned in December and conducted by Wollert- Elmendorff Deutsche Industrie Treuhand, an accountancy firm. Mr Schimmelbusch is being investigated by the Frankfurt prosecutor's office for failing to keep the supervisory board informed as required under German law. He has twice publicly denied responsibility for the debacle, and said he will take all steps to defend his reputation. The report, examined by Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board on March 11, focused mainly on the oil futures trading activities of MG Corp, Metallgesellschaft's New York-based trading subsidiary, which gave rise to losses of DM2.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn) and drove the group to the brink of bankruptcy. MG Corp's oils futures commitments increased eightfold to 160m barrels during the 1992-93 financial year. The report, an abridged version of which was published yesterday, concluded that: Mr Forster, the former finance director, was aware of the growing risks associated with the oil futures business from the summer of last year. Other members of the group's management board - including Mr Schimmelbusch - regularly received documents showing the rising scale of unrealised gains and realised losses. The information given to the board as a whole, however, was deficient in relation to the seriousness of the business risks. MG Corp's accounts, prepared according to US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), provided a flattering picture of business development at the company. Had they been prepared according to German rules, profits from MG Corp would have been considerably lower than reported. The supervisory board was not correctly informed of developments at MG Corp. Dealings between MG Corp and Castle Corporation, an oil refining company with which MG Corp had a tangled business relationship, were skewed to the benefit of Castle. In November 1993, MG Corp's investment in Castle, a former shell company, totalled Dollars 500m. Three senior MG Corp executives were directors of Castle; MG Corp executives owned 3.9 per cent of the shares in Castle in November last year. The supervisory board said the report supported its argument that it was misled by Mr Schimmelbusch and Mr Forster.</p>

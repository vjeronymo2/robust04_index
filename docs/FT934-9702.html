			<p>931109 FT  09 NOV 93 / Survey of Australia (6): Geography has the last word - Asia trade gathers pace AS THE Uruguay round of talks on world trade liberalisation sinks deeper into uncertainty, Australia's regional trading initiative, the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum (Apec), is gaining increasing support from both within and outside the region. For the Labor government which sired the idea, Apec is starting to pay dividends on two fronts. First, it is rewarding the gamble to grab the leadership initiative in a region where most other countries regard Australia as a suspicious white foreigner. Secondly, Apec is beginning to look like it might provide an avenue for greatly liberalised trading between the region and its major western trading partners, particularly North America. Apec was born partly of Australia's frustrations over the agricultural subsidy war between the US and the European Community. Often caught in the crossfire, Australia has sought to use whatever influence it had to get other countries together and get an open multilateral trading system working, even if only on a regional level. Australia has suffered severely from the grains war, with the US infringing on several of its traditional wheat markets, including China, Kuwait, Yemen and Pakistan. As a result, its wheat export earnings have fallen from a peak of ADollars 2.45bn in 1989 to ADollars 1.51bn in 1991, a decline aggravated by droughts in wheat-growing areas. Together with other non-subsidised agricultural exporters snared in the war, Australia has formed the Cairns Group, which has played a key role in getting the Gatt talks to focus on agricultural trade liberalisation. But France's continuing intransigence over subsidies will now force Australia to re-channel energy to Apec. Apec was also born of a determination to get accepted as an integral part of the Asia Pacific region, and thus get a better share of the bounty from its dynamic economies. Despite its proximity, Australia has not really developed strong trading relations with the region. This was partly because in many of the countries, especially in south-east Asia, former western colonial markets are very well entrenched. Australia also suffered from an image problem: while geographically located in the region, it is seen to represent the interests of the big white man. Australia itself has traditionally enjoyed more comfortable trading with Britain and Europe. Over the last decade, Australia has tried to rectify the position. Prime minister Paul Keating, while still treasurer in the early 1980s, began switching the government's focus from Europe to the Asia Pacific. During his first term as prime minister, Australian business and government for the first time joined forces to capture a larger slice of the lucrative Asian market. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has enlisted business support to produce trade and investment strategy in south-east and north-east Asia. The strategies drew on experiences pf Australian companies already operating in the region, and identified opportunities as well as constraints in doing business in the region. The trade department has also restructured its operations so that for the first time, the Asia division is now bigger than the Europe and the American branches. The efforts have been well rewarded. In Vietnam, which has just opened its doors to foreigners, Australia has emerged as one of the biggest investors. Earlier this year, BHP won the contract to develop the huge Dai Hung oilfields. The project, worth around USDollars 1.5bn, places Australia as the second largest investor in Vietnam, next to Taiwan. When Apec was first mooted in 1989 by the then Australian prime minister, Mr Bob Hawke, it was greetly blandly by its polite Asian neighbours. Japan and the US were even more guarded, unsure of how the new grouping fitted in among the established institutions with which they already had pleasant relationships, especially the Association of South East Asian Nations. Dr Mahathir Mohamed, the Malaysian prime minister who had organised another grouping, was outright suspicious of Apec. His East Asia Economic Caucus excludes Australia and New Zealand. But because of the faltering Gatt talks, the main mechanism for multilateral trading, it seems that the previously most cynical Apec members now accept that regional integration would be the best insurance against a Gatt collapse. The most dramatic turnaround was from the US. During Mr Keating's visit to Washington last month, US president Bill Clinton threw his full weight behind Apec as another link in the free trade chain, and as a vehicle for locking the US into the region. Importantly, there have also been strongly positive signals of Japan's acceptance of Australia's leadership. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry has said it was important that Mr Keating kept up the momentum for regional integration. And the head of the Asian research arm of Nomura Securities, Mr C. H. Kwan, has said: 'Australia has a big role to play in this region. It is very difficult for Japan to play a leadership role because of its relations with Asean, and Australia is in the best position in the region to bring everybody together to discuss common interests.' Apec has also achieved a political coup by getting the three Chinas - Beijing, Taiwan and Hong Kong - sitting together as members. With the members' growing receptiveness, Australia is poised further to assert its leadership, not only of the region but also of a more permanent body that would keep alive the region's hopes for continued liberalised trading.</p>

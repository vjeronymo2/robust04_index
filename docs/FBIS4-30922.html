			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 26 (CTK) -- At today's meeting with  Slovak President Michal Kovac, Czech President Vaclav Havel  pointed out the restrained Czech attitude to Slovak politics,  Havel told journalists.    "It would be unwise if the Czech card is played during the  coming election campaign," he said, referring to allegations of  Slovak federalism.    In the Czech Republic or Slovakia there are no serious  forces  wishing for the restoration of Czechoslovakia, Kovac said.    The validity of Benes decrees has not been questioned in  Slovakia, he said.    Havel said he was glad Slovakia had joined the border  regime.  Border procedures are time-consuming and facilities are on a  lower level than on the borders with other neighboring  countries, Kovac said, adding that more finance and better  administration are needed. "The (Czech and Slovak) Governments  are aware of the painful situation and will have to resolve it  promptly," Kovac said. Kovac and Havel are to meet next in  Prague after the Slovak elections.</p>

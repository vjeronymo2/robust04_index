They must not forget the lessons of history. NODONG SINMUN  today says this in an article titled "Militarist Monster  Bringing Disaster."    Pointing out that the Japanese militarists are making  desperate efforts to make up for the defeat that they suffered  in the past, the author of the article says:    Japan has potentials of the munitions industry that defy  comparison with what it had when invading the continent.    A robber gets a deadly weapon for murder. Likewise, the  Japanese reactionaries, carried away by revengeful thought and  wild ambition for overseas expansion, are whetting the sword for  aggression and war.    The "U.N. peacekeeping operation bill" railroaded through  the  Diet gave the first green light to Japan's troops dispatch  overseas, after the war. In other words, the "Self-Defence  Forces [SDF]", which has turned from a tadpole to a frog, has  become able to jump out of the boundary of the country and  freely strut about in the outside world.    The Japanese reactionaries argue that the "SDF's" operation  within the "U.N. commanding sphere" conforms to the constitution  and so the involvement in the U.N. peacekeeping operation must  be a basic task of the "SDF". This betrays their intention to  embark upon full-scale overseas aggression under the name of the  United Nations.    Japan committed aggression and war under the pretext of  "peace of the East" and "protection of Japanese residents  overseas" in the past and now it seeks to repeat it under the  pretext of "international contribution" and "rescue of Japanese  overseas".    These days the Japanese reactionaries let loose outpourings  about "the dispatch of the Self-Defence Forces to the Korean  peninsula" and about Japan's "entry into a Korean war". This is  illustrative of the realistic danger and gravity of their  overseas aggression.    What draws attention in Japan's scheme of overseas  aggression  is that Japan is now covetous of the whole world, though its  ambition was confined to Asia in the past. This is why Japan is  scheming to send its Armed Forces to different parts of the  world including Asia and Africa for military actions. For this  very purpose Japan is trying its hardest to get a permanent seat  of the United Nations Security Council.    Today Japan's nuclear armament has reached the practical  stage. If Japan which imposed immeasurable damages on mankind  arms itself even with nuclear weapons, the consequences will be  unpredictable.    Misfortunes must be checked in advance.</p>

			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Berkeley beats housing rivals with 25% increase to Pounds 15.8m BERKELEY GROUP, the Surrey-based housebuilder, underscored its ability to outperform its rivals yesterday when it reported a 25 per cent increase in profits. The pre-tax line jumped to Pounds 15.8m in the year to April 30 compared with Pounds 12.6m last time - comfortably ahead of the Pounds 15m minimum forecast at the time of the 1-for-4 rights issue which raised Pounds 44.1m in March. Turnover rose 44 per cent to Pounds 182m (Pounds 126m), mainly reflecting the 1,226 units sold last year as against 858 in the preceding period. Earnings per share increased to 16p from an adjusted 13.1p and the group plans to pay an increased final dividend of 4.35p (3.5p), making a total of 6p (5p). Mr Tony Pidgley, chief executive, emphasised that the results were achieved despite the extremely volatile domestic housing market, particularly in the wake of the UK's withdrawal from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism in September when prices fell sharply again and margins were under intense pressure. Mr Graham Roper, chairman, said the slight strengthening in the market in the new year had little beneficial effect on sales prices, but did help the group meet its targets in terms of sales volumes and unit numbers. Operating profits increased to Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 11.2m) including a Pounds 4.5m full year contribution from St George, a joint venture between Berkeley and Speyhawk until Speyhawk sold its 50 per cent stake to Berkeley in September 1991. St George builds mainly lower priced social housing in London. Net interest receipts totalled Pounds 359,000 compared to net interest costs of Pounds 733,000 in the previous year. At the end of April the group had net cash of Pounds 3.8m excluding the rights issue proceeds, compared with net borrowings of Pounds 2.5m. Berkeley has also been steadily increasing its investment in commercial property at a time when prices have been at basement levels. Berkeley Eastoak Investments, its joint venture with Saad Investments of the Middle East, has so far spent almost Pounds 120m building up its portfolio and aims to invest a total of Pounds 200m. COMMENT Tony Pidgley has consistently managed to stay one jump ahead of the property market. The decision in 1989 to liquidate land holdings and work in progress has paid off handsomely. It has enabled the group to follow a buy-build policy throughout the recession and to acquire quality land at reasonable prices. Currently the group has 'control' over 5,000 plots, including 3,000 with detailed planning permission, and expects to increase the number of houses built this year by about 25 per cent. Pre-tax profits this year could reach Pounds 25m, producing earnings of 21.8p and a prospective p/e of 18.5. At 404p the stock is not a bargain but the group deserves its high rating.</p>

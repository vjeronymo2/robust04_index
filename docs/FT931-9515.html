			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Fowler warns Tory rebels THE Conservative party leadership yesterday stepped up its warnings to rebel Euro-sceptic backbenchers over the consequences of backing a Labour amendment to the Maastricht bill intended to implement the social chapter, Ivo Dawnay writes. Opponents of the treaty say a vote for the amendment would wreck British ratification and, because of the way it is drafted, have no bearing on whether or not Britain joined the protocol on workplace rights. In a speech aimed at party dissidents, Sir Norman Fowler said Tory rebels would be backing a social chapter that was 'nothing less than an engine of job destruction'. The party chairman's speech is part of a campaign to pressure anti-Maastricht MPs back into line with the leadership. Government business managers are also warning the rebels that an abstention or a vote with Labour on the social chapter amounts to a vote for socialism. Sir Norman was careful yesterday to target the employment implications of the chapter, saying it would raise business costs, lower competitiveness and increase unemployment. 'It is essential that we promote policies in this country which will help to stop the increase in unemployment and bring forward the time when it begins to fall,' he said.</p>

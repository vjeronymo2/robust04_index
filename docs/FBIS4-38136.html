			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Fathi al-Shiqaqi, identified as a </F> "co-founder" of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, by  Hanadi Salman in al-Yarmuk Camp in Damascus; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Salman] It seems the movement  is heading toward establishing a political movement. Is this so?    [Al-Shiqaqi] There is much talk about this, but we have not  yet reached a point that permits us to announce a political  front or a political party inside Palestine by tomorow.  However, this is how things look. We do not want any sort of  collision with the new Palestinian Authority. Since we do not  want collision and since armed collision is wrong, then what we  are required to do is to intensify our political, social, and  cultural activity in the self- rule areas, but of course not at  the expense of our jihad. This leads us to think of  establishing an Islamic-national-popular bloc that could act as  a political opposition to the settlement and to the Zionist  trends that currently exist within the self-government authority  without colliding with them. Debates are now underway within  the movement to find a mechanism for this. Discussions are also  under way with our friends in Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] on the nature and type of this framework, etc...  However, some obstacles and many unanswered questions still  remain before us.    [Salman] So you are talking about a framework that is not  confined to the "Islamic Jihad" only?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Such a framework, if established, would not act  as a substitute for the Jihad Movement. The Islamic Jihad  Movement will continue to exist and operate covertly inside the  occupied territories. It will play the same role it is playing  now. On the other hand, if such a framework is established it  will not be a party exclusive to the Islamic Jihad. We will try  to make it a party or a framework grouping all the  oppositionists. We could fail, but at least we always try to  make it broader than the Islamic Jihad and to involve other  popular figures.    [Salman] What is the response of the other quarters you are  contacting? Are they positive?    [Al-Shiqaqi] In principle, yes. But questions and  complications always come up. The reality we live in inside  Palestine is still difficult. Questions arise about the nature  of the self-rule authority, how it will assume its role, and how  it will deal with the opposition and with the enemy. All these  questions are put forward making us unable to come to a final or  decisive picture of the framework of which we are thinking.    [Salman] You said that the Jihad Movement will continue to  play the same role it is playing now. Does this apply to the  entire West Bank and Gaza or are Gaza and Jericho excluded?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Our work will continue in all Palestine. The  self-rule area makes up 2 percent or less of the total area of  Palestine; that is, there is 98 percent of Palestine that will  be open for jihad against the enemy as the case was before, and  we hope it will grow. Within the self-rule area, our decision  is that the occupation still exists; in fact its military  presence has intensified. Thus, so long as the occupation  remains, we believe that it is our right to confront this  occupation by force. The military operations we have carried  out following the redeployment [of Israeli troops] or following  the entry of the [Palestinian] police sought to prove to the  world and to our people that the occupation still exists. The  operations were carried out in the northern, southern, and  central parts of Gaza. We clashed with soldiers wherever we  found them. Thus, the Israeli withdrawal is a trick and is not  real. So even in these areas we will continue until we see a  real withdrawal. Once we see a real withdrawal from the  self-rule areas we will stop. But if the occupation remains, we  will continue our jihad.    [Salman] How can a confrontation with the Palestinian  Authority be avoided?    [Al-Shiqaqi] We always appeal to the Palestinian police and  the new Authority to examine our objectives and pay heed to the  fact that we really give priority to the avoidance of any clash  with them. Nevertheless, we cannot allow [Israeli] soldiers to  remain around us while we sit back and watch them. In all our  statements, we address the Palestinian police on this issue,  saying that we cannot halt our jihad as long as we see one  Israeli soldier able to come into the Gaza Strip and pursue our  mujahidin. This whole issue remains under discussion but we  still give priority to non- confrontation with the police and  the Authority.    [Salman] Have the Palestinian police given any signs of  their  intentions toward the movement?    [Al-Shiqaqi] In the past few weeks, the Palestinian police  have arrested more than one brother from the Islamic Jihad  Movement. They were subsequently released but their detention  came as a surprise to us. We believe it was not a step in the  right direction. Still, we have discovered that they want to  start a dialogue with the movement inside Palestine. We are not  refusing, particularly if the dialogue is conducted inside  Palestine with the aim of avoiding any clashes, which can happen  at any time. We have also heard that people from other groups  have been arrested. We are surprised that the Palestinian  Authority, already accused of being a tool of the Zionist enemy,  should take steps to prove this charge by detaining mujahidin  formerly wanted by the occupation authorities.    Despite our goodwill and willingness to avoid clashes, and  even our abstention from sharing authority with them, the  situation remains unclear and the Authority's attitude to the  opposition remains confused.    [Salman] Have you actually begun a dialogue with the  Palestinian Authority or is this still just an idea at this  stage?    [Al-Shiqaqi] When the recent arrests took place, some  brothers, Islamic Jihad sympathizers, conducted a dialogue with  the new Authority to secure the release of the detainees.    [Salman] Was the dialogue limited to this issue?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Naturally the dialogue branched off onto other  issues. Just as the brothers made demands, the Authority made  demands. These arrests have been partly a form of political  blackmail. They held some young men as hostages to make the  movement change its policies toward the occupation. We harbor  no violent designs against the Palestinian Authority. We have  political designs. They want us to alter our policies toward  the occupation in return for releasing our brothers. Of course  we rejected this logic and insisted on exercising our right to  resist the occupation as long as it lasts.    [Salman] Some movements opposed to the agreement have said  that they will not alter their policies but will alter their  "tactics" in the future. Does this apply to Islamic Jihad also?    [Al-Shiqaqi] This is possible. When we speak in a political  context, this signifies an alteration of tactics. It was  impossible to speak in a political context when the occupation  authorities were still here, or in the areas where the  occupation continues. This proves that we can alter our moves.    [Salman] Has anything been decided in this context or is the  issue under discussion? Changes on the political front are  merely one form of alteration.    [Al-Shiqaqi] The movement is still debating the question of  military action against occupation troops in the autonomy areas.  Our decision at this moment remains to confront the occupation  forces.    [Salman] Some opponents of the Islamic Jihad Movement say  that the movement's only chance of survival is to adhere to its  opposition of the Declaration of Principles since it does not  possess the popularity or the seniority of the other Palestinian  movements, which someday could be prepared to join the National  Authority. What do you say?    [Al-Shiqaqi] First: The Islamic Jihad Movement is well  established in Palestine. Everybody knows that it and Hamas are  the two most prominent opposition movements inside Palestine.  It is present in every city and village in Palestine. True,  its presence is less than that of Hamas, but its history is very  recent and financial resources are very limited. So any  comparison between us and Hamas would no doubt show that our  presence in Palestine is less than Hamas'. We have very limited  resources compared to the other Palestinian organizations, but  we have managed to maintain a relatively active presence.  Second: We are not the only opponents of the Declaration of  Principles. There are 10 or more factions opposed to the  Declaration of Principles. Even the Communist Party, which is  now called the People's Party, has issued a statement opposing  the Cairo Agreement. This means that the People's Party has  agreed to the Oslo Agreement but rejected the Cairo Agreement.  The only movement that supports the Declaration of Principles is  Fatah; that is, part, but not all, of Yasir 'Arafat's group. So  if we are talking about opposition, we are not the first or last  oppositionists. The opposition is comprehensive and wide. But  if we are talking about military action, this is another story.    [Salman] But with the signs indicating that some other  movements are prepared to join the National Authority, is your  refusal to join this Authority what makes you stand out?    [Al-Shiqaqi] The opposition movements inside Palestine, be  they Hamas or other national forces, still refuse to join the  authority. For us, it seems that not everybody is convinced of  participating in the authority and when we say so we mean it.  This stems from the nature of the ideology and ideas we believe  in and from the nature of our stand vis-a-vis the Zionist enemy  and the new authority. Throughout our history, our friends,  allies, and even adversaries know that we do not deceive or  double-talk and that when we say something we mean it. Thus,  the question of non-participation is not due to the  insignificance of the movement as much as it is the result of a  firm conviction held by every individual within the movement.    [Salman] How do you assess the Jihad Movement's relations  with Hamas?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Our relations with Hamas are excellent. Hamas  is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood and represents the  shift within the intifadah. Before the intifadah, we used to  differ over some theoretical and practical matters inside  Palestine, particularly the need for immediate jihad. This  issue was a source of disagreement between us. But with the  outbreak of the intifadah, the gap narrowed and the  sensitivities diminished. This was accompanied by several  official meetings from the two sides over the past five years.  We met inside Palestine and abroad and held lengthy discussions  in an attempt to find as much common ground as possible and  coordinate between us. At the theoretical and political levels,  our relations are very good, but there is still a distance we  have to travel toward establishing things on the ground, such as  the formation of a stronger front or stronger institutions. We  have not yet succeeded in this matter, but in the theoretical  and political domains, there has been great understanding and  coordination in the past years. There is a tendency toward  establishing more coordination with Hamas. Meetings have been  held recently toward that end.    [Salman] Were the meetings held inside and abroad?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Yes.    [Salman] What about Al-Jihad's relations with the Fatah  movement?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Our relations with Yasir 'Arafat have never  been  positive. There are no personal sensitivities between us. We  have never met in a battle or at a dinner table. Relations have  not been positive because of the political line followed by  'Arafat during the past years, his constant plotting against the  Islamic al-Jihad Movement, and his attempts to tempt and disrupt  the movement's ranks and create dummy organizations under the  "Islamic al-Jihad's" name. Therefore, and to protest this  political and scheming line, we have always refused to even meet  him despite his persistence and his dispatch of envoys to us.    But this does not prevent us from having ties of friendship  with some of Fatah's cadres or youths inside the occupied  territories. They were serious in resisting the occupation from  outside and inside the prisons. This has also not prevented us  from receiving in our offices and houses some Fatah figures  whose views differ from 'Arafat's.    [Salman] Al-Jihad Movement says that it refuses to have a  dialogue with 'Arafat, while he says that he does not want to  have a dialogue with you in the first place?    [Al-Shiqaqi] He has never said that he refuses to have a  dialogue with us. He has sent one delegation after the other to  this office. (Police commander) Yusuf Nasr was one of those he  has sent and Nasr said in an interview few days ago that he is  having a dialogue with the "Islamic al-Jihad" movement.    [Salman] A dialogue through the detainees?    [Al-Shiqaqi] No. The dialogues were held inside [the  territories]. Messengers from Yasir 'Arafat came here to this  office several times. We told them that we are not opposed to  having a dialogue with those whom we respect personally, but we  are not willing to start a dialogue with Yasir 'Arafat. This is  our stand that they always took back with them despite the many  messeges that were sent.    They even contacted us on behalf of Yasir 'Arafat exactly  two  weeks ago to ask us to initiate a dialogue. They contacted us  here and said that 'Arafat wants to open a dialogue with us in  order to solve the problems inside. We rejected any form of  contacts outside the territories and said that the problems must  be solved in the field between those involved in them.    [Salman] Is it true that you were offered seats on the  Palestine National Council [PNC]?    [Al-Shiqaqi] Yes, when the 19th or 20th PNC session was held  in Algeria. The number of seats was not specified but they said  that the PNC is open to us and we could participate. We replied  in a letter distributed to all the members. We also issued a  statement in which we said that we were not seeking seats but a  solid and strong stand, which we would support even if we did  not a have a seat in the PNC. National unity is not merely a  framework but a solid program.    [Salman] Does this mean that the dialogue with the PLO is  severed until Yasir 'Arafat's downfall?    [Al-Shiqaqi] I do not know if there is still a PLO or not.  There is today a new self-rule administration. Will there be  talks with the self-rule administration or not? As to the PLO,  it is difficult for Yasir 'Arafat to say that he is talking on  its behalf today. There is nothing called the PLO anymore.  There is in fact a new authority that cancels all the past.    [Salman] What about the dialogue with the new authority?    [Al-Shiqaqi] We are pragmatists. Inside Palestine, we will  be ready to disengage from any clash with any party, whether it  is the new authority or others.</p>

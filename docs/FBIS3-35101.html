			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Playing With Pressler"] </F>   [Text] That the Clinton administration has decided to  retain the nuclear sanctions against Pakistan as envisaged under  the Pressler amendment, at least for the time being, would,  without doubt, prompt questions about the U.S. policy.  Indications that the Clinton administration was increasingly in  favour of repealing the amendment on grounds that it no longer  advances U.S. non- proliferation goals put a strain on Indo-U.S.  relations. The more so in view of the puzzling shifts in U.S.  postures that seem to alternately confirm and deny a definite  pro-Pakistani tilt. Such an Indian feeling was reinforced by  the vigorous diplomatic exercise launched by Pakistan to  convince Washington of the need to exclude Islamabad from the  Pressler law on grounds that it was one-sided and that it  damages Pakistan's conventional military capability, or in other  words, gives India a strategic edge.    With many in the administration buying such an argument,  Delhi had compelling reasons to see the move to have the  Pressler amendment repealed as yet another anti-India stratagem  of the Clinton administration. The latest decision to retain  the amendment must surely have come as a severe jolt to Ms.  Benazir Bhutto's government, though she must have received other  placatory assurances from the U.S.. And while Delhi has reason  to be pleased with the decision, it would be imprudent on its  part to take the decision as final.    The move, in any case, is not inspired by a new-found  enlightenment in the Clinton administration about the merits of  following a more even-handed approach towards the subcontinent.  Rather, as admitted by the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for  International Development, Mr. Brian Atwood, the move is purely  tactical, with a view not to rub Congressmen the wrong way.  Besides, in the interim before the current legislation on  foreign aid presented to the U.S. Congress becomes law, the  Clinton administration is likely to continue its search for a  two-way deal on the nuclear issue whereby in return for some  nuclear concessions from Pakistan, the Congress can be goaded to  lift an amendment the administration wants repealed. Above all,  our relief over the retention of the amendment should be  tempered with the fact that Pakistan already has a nuclear  weapons programme in place. Nevertheless, the decision to retain  the amendment signals that nuclear non-proliferation remains a  major aim of U.S. policy, however, it is pursued. U.S.  relations with Pakistan are complicated by what Washington wants  to impose on India -- by making use of Pakistan as the lever of  American pressure on this country.</p>

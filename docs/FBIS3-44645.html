The fact that enterprises put into practice  the shareholding system is one of the major forms of  establishing a modern enterprise system. China has already  experimented with joint-stock enterprises for several years and  made new beneficial explorations for China's enterprise system.  Recently, the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy,  the State Economic and Trade Commission, and the State  Securities Commission jointly organized personnel to conduct  surveys of some listed companies in some areas. The report  written by a staff reporter and released today gives an idea of  the surveys, the experience gained, and the new problems raised  for everyone's reference.    Since China's economic restructuring has shifted from rural  areas to cities, the vitality of state-owned enterprises,  especially large and medium-sized enterprises, has been a  central question with which we have always been concerned. What  is the next step for deepening state-owned enterprises following  the contracted responsibility system? Precisely against this  background, the shareholding system was put forward. In October  1987, the report to the 13th CPC National Congress pointed out  that "the forms of the shareholding system emerging in the  course of reform, including the form whereby the state holds  most of the shares, departments, localities, and enterprises  hold some shares, and individuals can buy shares, is an  organizational form for the property of socialist enterprises  and can be experimented with continuously." Since then, the  number of experimental joint-stock enterprises in various  localities has increased rapidly. At present, there are some  5,000 joint-stock enterprises across the country, nearly 200 of  which have their shares traded on the market.    As an organizational form of modern enterprise, the  shareholding system is developing rapidly in China. Of course,  this kind of development is still proceeding in an experimental  stage. What people are concerned about is the question of  whether or not the objective of deepening enterprise reform has  been achieved after these experimental enterprises have been put  into operation. If so, in what aspects is this reflected?  <H3>  It Offers a Sharp Knife With Which To Separate Functions of  the Government From Those of the Enterprise and a Foundation  Stone on Which the Enterprise May Operate Independently. Now  That the Enterprise as a Legal Body Possesses Property Rights,  Its Numerous Relations With the Government Are Self-Evident, and  Only By Being So, Can the Enterprise Operate Independently With  Perfect Assurance. </H3>   The idea for state-owned enterprise reform in recent years  has basically been the delegation of administrative powers.  Power delegation involves two questions: First, the concept of  power delegation itself is not the negation of the system of  excessively concentrating the powers of the enterprise in the  hands of the government. Therefore, power delegation is only  limited, and an enterprise cannot change its status as a  subsidiary of the government despite power delegation.    Second, precisely because of the reasons mentioned above,  there is a comparatively large degree of haphazardness in the  government with regard to power delegation. It happens that  when instructed to delegate power, the government will do so and  that over time, it will recover the power delegated or that it  will not delegate power unless this is beneficial to it. With  regard to the government's delegation of power, the enterprise  is totally in a passive and subordinate status and the functions  of the government and of the enterprise are ultimately  inseparable. Now that the assets of the enterprise are owned by  the government and its managers are appointed by the government,  what can an enterprise base its independent operation on?    Between August and September 1993, the State Commission for  Restructuring the Economy, the State Securities Commission, and  the State Economic and Trade Commission jointly conducted  special surveys of how listed companies in Shenzhen, Hainan,  Shanghai, and Sichuan, where state-owned joint-stock enterprises  are more concentrated, was changing their operation mechanisms.  The surveys reported that by straightening out the relationship  between ownership and management, the listed companies have  smashed the traditional trammels of being subordinate to the  government and have succeeded in separating their functions from  those of the government and are able to operate independently.  This is mainly reflected by the following: They have  straightened out the relationship of interests with the  government and have changed from being solely responsible to  their supervisory departments to being responsible to all  shareholders. The enterprises turn over taxes to the state and  profits to owners, thus separating taxes from profits. They  have complete rights over the use of assets. They have changed  the previous practice of having their leaders appointed by the  government and then hired by the board of directors. Regarding  their investment decisions and project development, their board  of directors will first put forward investment proposals and  then decisions will be made by the meeting of shareholders. In  this way, the enterprises have the power to operate  independently and have money at their disposal. Managers of the  listed companies share a common feeling, namely that they have  all the 14 powers to be delegated to enterprises according to  the "Regulations," although they find it difficult to refuse  contributing to relevant quarters. This is incomparable with  the past before the system was changed. In early November 1993,  the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State  Economic and Trade Commission, and State Securities Commission  jointly called a symposium on the question of how listed  companies are changing their management mechanisms and they had  this common consensus: Listed companies are leading the way in  changing management mechanisms.    Given the same enterprises and the same government, why has  the relationship between the government and enterprises been so  easily straightened out after enterprise transformation with the  shareholding system and why was it difficult for the enterprise  to operate independently in the past before it was transformed  with the shareholding system? He Zhongze, who is deputy  director of the Enterprise Department of the State Commission  for Restructuring the Economy, and who is currently under  training as assistant manager of the Hainan Chemical Fiber  Industry Company Limited, said: "Under the traditional form of  ownership, the ownership of state property is not clearly  defined, so all government departments can exercise the power of  ownership on behalf of the state to interfere with the internal  affairs of the enterprise. Nevertheless, all of the departments  can shirk responsibility for the increase of the value of state  assets. If ownership is theoretically unclear, it is of course  impossible to define what belongs to whom in practice." Before  changing to the shareholding system, the Hainan Chemical Fiber  Industry Company Limited was a venture jointly developed by  three companies which included the Hainan Provincial Development  and Construction Corporation. This type of joint venture ought  to have a certain degree of independence with respect to  management mechanism compared with ordinary state-owned  enterprises. But since the three controlling parties were  state-owned enterprises, and since they employed different forms  of investment in the joint venture, powers, responsibilities,  and interests over the assets of the joint venture were not  clearly defined, the three cooperative parties continually had  conflicts with one another in the course of its management. In  the course of transforming the joint venture, on the basis of  scientific assets evaluation, the ownership of its stock assets  was reasonably defined, several other legal bodies were invited  to join as shareholders, and shares were issued to staff and  workers internally, thus defining the property rights of all the  assets of the joint venture in the form of law and setting  multiple restrictions on the share powers of corporate and  individual shareholders. The number of shares one holds  determines one's power and say in the enterprise. Each party  sends its own directors to the board of directors in keeping  with the number of shares held. All shareholders, whether of the  enterprise or the state, can only demonstrate their own will  during the process of policymaking through the directors they  have sent to the board. They cannot directly demand the  managers obey their own commands. Moreover, since the managers  are appointed by the board of directors, the general manager is  solely responsible to the board, but not to the government or to  a particular shareholder. Precisely because of this restricted  relationship of responsibilities, powers, and profits  established on the foundation of clearly defined property  rights, interference from outside the enterprise is out of the  question and the solicitation of instructions from higher  authorities in the course of the enterprise's policymaking is  unnecessary. Therefore, since practicing the shareholding  system, the Hainan Chemical Fiber Industry Company Limited has  all policymaking power within the enterprise and there is  basically no interference from government departments.  Shenzhen's Jintian Industries Company Limited cited such a  fact: In 1987, the company vied with other state-owned  enterprises to buy a newly built industrial plant in Liantang,  Shenzhen. But before these state- owned enterprises' reports to  their supervisory departments were approved, Jintian Company's  board of directors had already acquired possession of the plant.  For some time after Sichuan's Emeishan Salt Industry Group of  Companies Limited changed to the shareholding system, the  government departments concerned continued to manage the  company's manpower and financial and material resources with the  previous way of managing state-owned enterprises. Then the  company's general manager Li Jianwen made representations to the  departments concerned and these government departments decided  very quickly to delegate all powers, changing administrative  interference to participation in policymaking. On previous  occasions of power delegation, enterprises could do nothing when  they did not really get the power. But why did the government  departments really delegate power this time? The reason was:  Under the traditional system, an enterprise asking for power  from the government meant sharing its power. The government was  above the enterprise and so the latter was a "beggar." Now the  government is only a shareholder of the enterprise and if it  seizes all its power, it infringes on the interests of other  shareholders. The enterprise asks for power from the government  in order to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of  other shareholders, and in asking for power, this has a  completely different meaning from the past. Now government  departments are no longer faced with several factory managers  and secretaries whom they could dismiss and hire at their  discretion in the past, but with other investors who are on the  same footing as they. Sometimes, the balance of interests has a  stronger binding force than the government does.  <H3>  The Publicly Listed Company Accepts the Supervision of the  Community and the Public and Is At All Time Under Great Pressure  from Investor Demands for Higher Returns. It Cannot But  Exercise Control Over Itself. It Cannot But Consider Matters  From the Long-Term Perspective. It Cannot But Gear Itself to  the Needs of the Market. It Cannot But Compete. The General  Manager Said: We Are Under Too Great Pressure. </H3>   People in Shenzhen know that the Jintian Company is very  successful and the bosses of the company should naturally make  very good profits. Nevertheless, the first sentence the company  president Cai Mingxi said to the survey team sent from the State  Commission for Restructuring the Economy, State Economic and  Trade Commission, and State Securities Commission: To be  honest, none of us wish to work for joint-stock companies,  especially listed companies. The pressure is too great! The  pressure coming from the public on listed companies is several  times greater than that coming from government supervisory  departments on state-owned enterprises!    The Shenzhen Teli Machinery and Electricity Company Limited  was transformed from the former Shenzhen Machinery Industry  Company which was derived from the Shenzhen City Industry  Bureau. Before adopting the shareholding system, it consisted  of four state-owned enterprises and was given the annual profit  target of over one million yuan and allowed to retain the  remaining profits. The incomes of its staff and workers  increased each year, so both the company and outside quarters  were all satisfied. The situation is greatly different now that  the company has adopted the shareholding system. After turning  over taxes, the enterprise can only retain 15 percent of its  profits as a welfare fund and another 50 percent as bonus  dividends to shareholders. If less than the due amounts of  dividends are given, the shareholders call up all day and asking  what is going on. In the past, the enterprise emphasized stable  operations. But this year, it is only expected to perform  better than last year. Now it not only has to stress stability  but must continuously forge ahead because the shareholders make  comparisons. They demand that its profits be not lower than last  year and not lower than others', or else the president would  look bad when the mid-year and annual reports are given. Fang  Shimao, chairman of the board of the company, said: In the  past, if the company failed to complete the tasks, all we had to  do was explain the objective reasons to the departments  concerned and then we would be able to stay out of trouble. But  now, the shareholders will not accept explanations but will  force you to resign. It happened in the Shenzhen Anda Company  Limited that in the first half of 1991, the company called a  meeting of shareholders at which the shareholders unanimously  insisted on the resignation of its general manager. There was  only one reason for this, that was the bonus dividend allotted  to them in the first half of the year was too low, with only 0.2  yuan given for each share, which fell below the average profit  margin of joint-stock companies in Shenzhen at that time. The  then general manager had gone through observations by relevant  departments and was found to be "competent," so the holder of  state shares, the biggest shareholder, hesitated about whether  or not to dismiss him and hire another person. As a result,  many shareholders sold the warrants of the enterprise's enlarged  number of shares, causing them to fall to 0.05 yuan per warrant  and thus forcing the biggest shareholder to dismiss the general  manager. In 1992, the bonus dividend for each share came to  0.85 yuan.    As an enterprise without a higher authority over it, the  joint- stock company must accept supervision from three  quarters: First, by shareholders; second, by intermediary  organizations in society; and third, by public opinion. The  three quarters of supervision are mutually supplemental to a  certain degree, enabling the joint-stock enterprise to possess  an innately perfect self-restricting mechanism. Two major  problems in connection with the management of state-owned  enterprises were unresolved for a long time, namely their  short-term behavior and making undetected losses. These two  phenomena will almost not occur in the joint-stock enterprise.  As the decisionmaker of the enterprise, the board of directors  which represents the interests of shareholders is right in the  enterprise, whereas the state-owned enterprise's supervisory  department which has the final decisionmaking power is far from  the enterprise, so the enterprise finds it very easy to deceive  or hide the facts from the owners. However, the management  activities of the managing body headed by the general manager is  always under the supervision of the board of directors. Judging  from the actual situation of joint- stock enterprises across the  country, their boards of directors are basically comprised of  directors sent from big shareholders. The interests of big  shareholders are long-term interests, and they do not allow the  managing body to seek short-term gain by means of sharing the  enterprise's equipment with others. Still less will they allow  the method of dividing and using up the profits to please  floating speculating shareholders. Moreover, it is impossible  for the managing body to seek short-term gain because short-term  behavior weakens the competitiveness of the enterprise, and its  harm will surely be manifested in the following year or two.  Moreover, shareholders demand that the enterprise makes  continually increasing profits. Ultimately the managers can  hardly escape being held accountable to the shareholders. We  can say, therefore, that there is no incentive for short-term  behavior from the decisionmakers to the managers of a  joint-stock enterprise. The accounting office checks the  mid-yearly and annual accounting reports and figures of the  enterprise against its accounts and then publishes the results  of the checks to shareholders and assume legal responsibility  for the results. Fang Shimao, chairman of the board of  directors of the Shenzhen Teli Machinery and Electricity Company  Limited, said: It was completely at my own discretion to report  profits in the past, that means, when I wished to turn over  more, then I reported more, and when I wished to turn over less  I reported less. Now I cannot do this. I must report the exact  profits or losses and the accounting office will not allow you  to "report more or less," and it is more difficult to deal with  than the supervisory department in the past. As managers, you  cannot use the trick of reporting unnoticed losses, and you find  this unnecessary. You can no longer drift along today, and then  quit and take up a similar position elsewhere tomorrow. You  will ultimately be held "accountable" tomorrow by the owners  even if you hide yourself elsewhere. Public opinion will make  you lose your prestige in society.    Precisely because of the pressure coming from the several  areas, listed joint-stock enterprises generally have a sound  financial management system. Many enterprises practice a  financial management supervision system in which all financial  supervisors and other key financial staff are directly sent from  headquarters to their subsidiary companies, and their salaries  and bonuses are all approved and paid by the headquarters to  facilitate the effective management of the finances of  subsidiary companies. Shen Yigang, the general financial  director of Shenzhen's Jintian Company, said: "The financial  transparence of listed joint-stock companies is one of their  greatest characteristics. The half-yearly financial report and  business performance bulletin are unavoidable responsibilities  and obligations. Shareholders can query the business status of  the company at all times and by all forms. Therefore, if  managerial personnel at all levels of the company do not make  great efforts to restrict themselves and boost economic returns,  they cannot justify themselves at the meeting of shareholders."  In the past, enterprises bargained with their supervisory  departments in every effort to lower the profit target. After  being transformed with the shareholding system, the sense of  mission and urgency to increase of the value of the assets of  enterprises drive managers to seek maximum profits for their  enterprises. Without any outside interference, the Shanghai  First Pencil Company Limited raised the profit target three  times last year and succeeded in reaching it. In April, the  company raised by 54 percent the profit target set earlier in  the year at a meeting of shareholders. In this way, the  interests of the enterprise, of shareholders, and of managers  are perfectly integrated under the shareholding system.    Many general managers jokingly call themselves senior "wage  earners." They can fire ordinary staff and even vice general  managers, and can also be fired if the board of directors is  unsatisfied with their business performance. There is this  common consensus among listed joint-stock enterprises:  Enterprises are owned by shareholders and you must think of  ways to please them.  <H3>  The Shareholding System, a Modern Enterprise System, Is  Displaying its Attractive Charm in China's Enterprise Reform.  Through Transformation to the Shareholding System, We Are  Beginning To Be Able To Resolve Deep-Seated Economic Problems  Such as Readjusting the Industrial Structure and Enhancing the  Vitality of State-Owned Enterprises. </H3>   In July, Shenzhen's Zhongguo Baoan Group of Companies  Limited  purchased large numbers of the shares of Shanghai's Yanzhong  Company Limited and caused a great wave in Shanghai's stock  exchange. Some people made a fortune and others got tied up.  Shareholders were at a loss for some time. Despite the fact  that this was the first time in China that a joint-stock  enterprise purchased over 16 percent of the shares of another  joint-stock enterprise without conforming to some norms, the  China Securities Supervision and Administration Committee  acknowledged the validity of the purchase. We should encourage  this kind of purchase because this really shows that the most  essential significance of the stock market is not to offer a  site for stock speculators, but that it has formed an equity  market, offering us an effective method of achieving the  rational flow of assets, especially stock assets, on a larger  scope and readjusting the industrial structure. The very reason  the readjustment of the transregional and intertrade industrial  structure has proceeded so slowly for many years does not lie  with enterprises but with a plurality of departments. A merger,  for example, would often put the numerous departments of two  parties into protracted talks. In the case of the equity  market, the Zhongguo Baoan Company saved the effort of  consulting the relevant departments. Moreover, the Yanzhong  Company had no idea about the purchase beforehand. How quick  this transaction was concluded! How efficient it was!    Judging from the experimental joint-stock enterprises in  China at the present time, the majority of them have  transregional and intertrade characteristics. The Nantong  Machine Tool Factory was a state-owned enterprise which entered  the international market and whose exports had a ranking  position in the same trade. But its productive capacity was  inadequate and badly needed expansion. Nantong City had seven  related factories. Some were people-owned enterprises; some  were collectively-owned enterprises; and others were city and  township enterprises. Of the people-owned enterprises, some  were owned by the city and others by prefectures and counties.  In order to merge the seven enterprises into one big company,  they used the shareholding system to form the Nantong Machine  Tool Company Limited, broke through departmental ownership and  regional boundaries, and developed it into an enterprise group,  readjusting the irrational enterprise structure. Each party was  given bonus dividends according to the number of shares they  hold. And through participation and decisionmaking in the board  of directors, the various parties have coordinated their  interests and brought into play their own initiative. This kind  of joint-stock enterprise group formed by linking assets has its  responsibilities, powers, and interests better defined than  ordinary enterprise groups, smoother operational mechanisms, and  therefore have a more obvious scale of merit.    The vitality of state-owned enterprises is a central  question  we are trying to settle in the course of reform. The vitality  of state-owned enterprises and their structure are two  questions, but they are interally very closely linked. The  irrational structure affects vitality to a certain degree,  because if vitality is lacking there is no motivation for  structural readjustment. The shareholding system is like a  two-edged sword which has changed the two questions from mutual  containment to mutual promotion. The Shenzhen Property Company  Limited originally had net assets totalling 100 million yuan.  Its assets were assessed in the process of changing to a  joint-stock enterprise and its net assets rose to 180 million  yuan. Then through shares issued at a premium, its net assets  leaped to over 600 million yuan. Its business has changed from  just the construction industry to the construction industry,  tourism, and the real estate industry. After changing to the  shareholding system, it turned over 4.8 million yuan to the  state each year. In 1992 when it was changed to a joint-stock  enterprise and was listed, it earned 160 million yuan of profits  and taxes. In the first six months of 1993, it earned an  after-tax profit of 160 million yuan and it is expected to have  no problem earning 300 million yuan of profits and taxes in the  whole year. In this way, the state can earn 216 million yuan as  it owns 72 percent of shares. The profit is many more times  than in the past before it was changed into a joint-stock  company! Sichuan's Emeishan Salt Chemical Company Limited sold  the premiums of state shares, whose proportion was excessively  large, to corporate enterprises, and invested the funds earned  in other trades and industries with higher profits and better  prospects of development. Now its national assets have  increased in value and its salt production structure has been  adjusted, strengthening its ability to adapt to changes in the  market.    The results of the surveys conducted by the joint survey  team  of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economy, the State  Economic and Trade Commission, and the State Securities  Commission show that the shareholding system, an organizational  form of modern enterprises, enables listed enterprises to get  huge vitality and demonstrates an exceedingly strong  self-developing capacity. The actual profits earned by the 12  listed companies syrveyed in Shanghai increased in 1992 over the  same period the previous year, with the rates of increase  ranging from 35 to 400 percent. Compared with the same period  in 1992, the actual profits in the first six months of 1993 had  increases ranging from 44 to 274 percent. The five companies  listed in Hainan this year earned after-tax profits totaling 253  million yuan in 1992, while their after-tax profits in the first  six months of 1993 already reached 331 million yuan,  representing a 30.83-percent increase in after-tax profits over  the whole year of 1992.    The transformation of China's enterprise with the  shareholding system is still at the experimental stage, and  there is still a lot of work to do for us to further standardize  it. We should not, of course, take pride in the achievements we  have obtained, but all this has convinced us of the need to  unswervingly proceed with experimentation with the shareholding  system. As an important choice for us to deepen reform of large  and medium-sized state-owned enterprises and change their  management mechanisms, the shareholding system is demonstrating  its huge superiority.</p>

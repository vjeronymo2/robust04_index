			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Collectors beat dealers to Paris furniture: Saleroom THE SALE in Paris this week of medieval and Renaissance furniture from the collection of the French dealer Bruno Perrier, which many had predicted would be a catastrophe, turned out to be the most successful sale of its type for years. Held by Jacques Tajan, the auction comprised 56 lots and made a total of FFr21.45m (Pounds 2.22m). It also established a number of record prices. Every leading dealer in Haute Epoque furniture attended the sale, only to be outbid every time by private collectors who pushed most of the prices high above estimate. A New York collector acquired an exceptionally rare late 17th century Piedmontese set of eight chairs, four armchairs and settee with well preserved embroidered covers for FFr2.45m, above its FFr1m estimate. Bidding for a 13th century oak cathedral chest with iron strapwork from Durham tripled its estimate to reach FFr1.1m, establishing a record for English oak furniture. Competition for an oddly-shaped 16th century Lombard dignitary's chair in walnut pushed the price up to FFr900,000, a record for a chair of the period. At the Drouot salerooms bids for the original 31-page handwritten pencil manuscript of Maurice Ravel's Bolero of 1928 reached FFr1.8m. It was pre-empted by the Bibliotheque Nationale. Christie's sale of the Vung Tau cargo of 17th century Chinese blue and white export porcelain in Amsterdam totalled Pounds 4.165m against an estimate of Pounds 1.5m. In London yesterday Christie's sold English furniture for Pounds 936,122, with 18 per cent unsold. A complete set of 12 Irish George II embossed bird pictures by Samuel Dixon, designed to be 'ornamental in lady's chambers', doubled their estimate at Pounds 115,500. At Sotheby's a Turner watercolour of Eyemouth in Berwickshire, commissioned to illustrate Scott's novel 'The Bride of Lammermoor', sold for Pounds 77,000, just on target.</p>

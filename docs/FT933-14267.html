			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / Technology: High-tech as a country pursuit Britain's rural areas increased their high-technology employment during the 1980s at the expense of urban centres, according to a study which pours cold water on notions that high-tech industries in the UK have the potential to become big employers. The report by Bernard Fingleton of the Department of Land Economy at Cambridge University underlines how cities often provide an unsuitable environment for modern manufacturing. This is partly on the basis that many companies in this activity employ large numbers of highly paid workers in scientific disciplines who prefer living in the countryside. Another factor is that high-tech companies - in sectors including pharmaceuticals, aerospace, electronics, optical technology and high-value plastics - often require specialised, low-cost manufacturing and research buildings which may be hard to find in urban areas. The report says that only three, predominantly rural, UK regions increased job numbers in high-tech fields in the 1984-89 period. The areas are Wales, Yorkshire &amp; Humberside and south-west England. Other regions, including the conurbations of Greater London and West Midlands, saw large falls in employment in technology-based industries. Between 1984 and 1989, numbers employed in this field fell by a greater amount than in manufacturing as a whole, while total employment, including services, rose due to the general economic expansion of that period. High-tech industries in the UK excluding Northern Ireland employed 782,000 people in 1989, 5.3 per cent down on the 826,000 five years earlier. Over the same period, the numbers in all types of manufacturing fell by 3.9 per cent, to 5.2m from 5.4m. During the five years, UK employment, generally, rose by 6.9 per cent. Behind the fall in high-tech employment is thought to be the large increases in productivity in these industries during the 1980s. Other factors were severe international competition and poor innovation in Britain. These aspects may limit the degree to which high-tech industry can expand in the UK in the 1990s. Specific factors pushing down high-tech employment in London and the south-east may have included the economic overheating of the late 1980s. This increased labour costs and rents at a particularly high rate in southern England, forcing expanding companies to move to other parts of Britain. Wales was a beneficiary of this process, the study says. Efforts, especially by the Welsh Development Agency, to attract high-tech companies helped to increase employment in this field nearly 50 per cent over the period, to just over 42,000 people. During the 1980s, other mainly rural parts of Britain increased high-tech employment, partly because of the attractions to many small companies of working in the countryside. Yorkshire and Humberside increased high-tech employment 24 per cent while the comparable figure for the south-west was 4 per cent. Greater London and West Midlands suffered a fall in the number of high-tech jobs of 31.1 per cent and 15.7 per cent respectively. In spite of a 6.3 per cent fall in employment in high-tech during the period in south-east England (not including Greater London) this region by the end of the 1980s continued to account for easily the greatest proportion of workers in this field. High-tech employees in the south-east compared with the overall technology workforce stayed constant at about 28 per cent during the period. The south-east has for many years had a high proportion of high-tech employees in its total workforce, partly because of the presence of big research centres in areas such as drugs, aerospace and electronics. Ominously, the study says it is difficult to envisage employment in high-tech industries expanding much in the 1990s. In 1989, this accounted for only 3.5 per cent of all UK employees and 15 per cent of manufacturing jobs.

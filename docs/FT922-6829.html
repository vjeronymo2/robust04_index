			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Observer: Tale of woe Having spent the last two years graphically depicting the impact of recession on its membership, the Confederation of British Industry yesterday poured out its own, sorry tale of financial hardship. The organisation's expanded accounts for 1991 show that an operating surplus of Pounds 756,000 in 1990 turned into a deficit of Pounds 188,000 last year  -a performance the CBI tries to pass off as an achievement in these tough times. But having preached the need for moderation on pay throughout the darks days of 1991, the CBI also disclosed that its own salary roll - despite a standstill in the numbers employed - rose by a healthy (some might say well above average) 12 per cent during the year. At least Sir John Banham, the retiring CBI director general, did not personally add to the organisation's swelling pay costs. Yesterday, he was again reminding people how he has consistently refused any pay rise during the slump - which puts Bank of England governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton's much trumpeted self-denial firmly in its place.</p>

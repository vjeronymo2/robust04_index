			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] The chairman of parliament Mechyslaw Hryb has told  voters in the regional capital Vitebsk that legislators will not  ratify the treaty with Russia on the unification of monetary  systems, if the government signs the document on Russian terms  which implies the closure of the National Bank of Belarus and  the unification of the budgets. The speaker is convinced that  the agreement must not undermine the sovereignty of his country.    He still thinks that before the treaty is signed the  banknotes of the National Bank should remain the only legal  tender in Belarus. He is alarmed by the fact that during the  five months of waiting for the unification trade, industry and  mutual settlements have frozen. Hryb said Belarus should get  full clarity on the matter as soon as possible because every day  of uncertainty "brings us closer to disaster."    Hryb sees the future of the country in a mixed  socially-oriented economy with a sufficiently strong role of the  government. In his opinion the economy can stabilize only on  condition of the revival of a common production space primarily  with Russia.    (INTERFAX Note: The parliament has ratified the treaty of an  economic union with Russia. Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich  finds it necessary to back the move by a public vote on 23 June  simultaneously with the first presidential elections. During  the vote the attitude of the nation to economic integration with  Russia could be defined. Quoting public opinion polls the prime  minister claims that the absolute majority of Belarusians  support a union with Russia. In the opinion of Kebich the  referendum would be an important instrument of strengthening  political stability in the country. Local experts view the  proposal of Kebich as an important political move by one of the  strongest candidates for presidency.)    Meanwhile, Hryb has not decided whether he is going to join  the race. "I must frankly admit that I am afraid of assuming  such a burden because I realize the responsibility it implies,"  he told voters in Vitebsk. Answering the question why the  constitution was approved by the parliament, not through a  public vote Hryb said that a referendum is the most uncivilized  way of approving the constitution because far from all citizens  could express a competent opinion of the fundamental law, while  the Belarusian Constitution was carefully examined by experts of  all levels for two and a half years.</p>

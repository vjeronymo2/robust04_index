			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [All quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Rabat, May 3 (MAP) -- The Moroccan human rights  organization, `OMDH' said it will extend its action to encompass  also the defense of economic, social and cultural rights, mainly  the right to work, unionist rights and the defense of the press  freedom.    President of the organization Abdelaziz Bennani said Monday  at a news conference economic, cultural and social rights are  intrinsically linked to civil and political rights and the OMDH  has received several complaints from citizens citing violations  of these rights, mainly the right to work and unionist rights.    The OMDH president added he notified to the authorities  reports of violations of these rights but received no answer.  The organization has also compiled several reports on abuses  harming economic, social and cultural rights which are mainly  noted in the practice of the right to unionist activities as  several complaints that reached the organization cited  restrictions of this right. Bennani also deplored that the  government's commitments vis-a-vis this right are not observed.    Concerning the right to work, the OMDH president said  violations in this regard are reflected by collective laying  down of workers, precarious jobs and the non-enforcement of the  minimum guaranteed salary by employers. He said the government  should shoulder its responsibilities in the respect of labor  rights which are regulated by texts that date back to the  protectorate era.    On the occasion of the celebration this May 3 of the world  press freedom day, the OMDH made public a statement pointing out  that recommendations of the national colloquy on information and  communication which called for the setting forth of an  information and communication strategy based on freedom of  speech and the democratization of the media were not respected.  The OMDH calls the legislative body to set in motion  recommendations adopted by the colloquy, on the basis of a  transparent and public debate of legislative texts. It also  urged for the setting up of a multi-party and independent body  stemming from the executive body which will see to the respect  of the mutli-party system and the audio-visual media freedom.    For the Moroccan human rights organization, `respect of the  press freedom, the right to information and the entire human  rights closely depends on the continuous action of journalists,  an action that is itself linked to the improvement of their work  and living conditions, the efficiency of the human rights  movement and the consolidation of the state of law foundations'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correpondent Boris Mainayev] </F>   [Text] Bishkek 25 April TASS -- Business people of China  and the Central Asian Republic of Kirgizia [Kyrgyzstan] plan to  step up mutually beneficial cooperation. Participants in the  meeting of Kirgiz and Chinese entrepreneurs, which was timed to  coincide with the visit by Chinese State Council Premier Li Peng  to Kirgizia this weekend, came to the conclusion that each  industry in the economies of both countries were of certain  mutual interest.    Kirgiz businessmen expressed readiness to supplement the  list  of the already existing 75 joint ventures with new ones, which  will use Chinese technologies in food-making, processing of  animal farming produce, manufacture of medicines and in  agriculture. In their turn, Chinese entrepreneurs are  interested in joint development of economic minerals, production  of building materials, construction of roads to connect Kirgizia  and China.    The meeting revealed certain differences between the Kirgiz  and Chinese business people. Thus, the Chinese side would like  to purchase Kirgiz electricity at prices close to the internal  ones, while Kirgizia intends to raise them up to the level of  world prices. But all these problems are quite solvable as long  as entrepreneurs of the two countries are ready to meet each  other halfway, participants in the meeting noted.    The meeting resulted in signing five protocols of intent,  which are to be put into actions as soon as certain concrete  projects are elaborated.    Last year's trade turnover between China and Kirgizia  exceeded 100 mln dollars. According to the State Council  premier, this figure is likely to be doubled this year.</p>

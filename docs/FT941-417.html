			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Well, not really so amazing Sir, I can't help but reflect that some purveyors of new technology get a little lost in their own cleverness. A recent advertisement for a mobile phone suggests we should prepare to be amazed '. . . you can actually answer the phone with your voice'. While not particularly amazed, perhaps your readers, like myself, can be comforted that our method of using the telephone, as established by Eddison all those decades ago, can continue, despite the heady pace of the telecommunications revolution.

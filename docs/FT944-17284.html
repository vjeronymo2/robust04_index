			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Sport: In a giant's footsteps - Simon Hughes treads carefully as he follows Ian Botham down the road - Cricket What, people ask, is Ian Botham up to these days? Here is a quick resume. He is trudging around the west coast of Britain for a month raising funds for leukaemia research. He will let the blisters calm down for a week, then he is off to Australia and New Zealand to promote his book, My Autobiography, before appearing alongside Rolf Harris in pantomime at Wimbledon. He will play one of Baron Hardup's men in Cinderella. Then he will change into his favourite jeans and T-shirt for a speaking tour of various countries with Allan Lamb. Then it will be summer again. 'Basically there's not a spare day in the diary until about June,' he said. But then Botham would not be Botham without activity (his name has even been used as an eponym - viz 'I was so angry I went totally Botham') and he needs people around him; on the cricket field, by the river bank, on the B-roads of north Wales where I joined him last week. Even in the middle of the night he likes company. Once, when we were both playing for Durham we were staying in a Nottingham hotel. I was asleep in a single room - a luxury on county cricket's relentless circuit. At 2am the phone went. 'Hi Yozzer, it's Beefy. Fancy some Burgundy in my room?' 'But it's the middle of the night,' I complained. 'I'm in the next room,' he replied. 'If you don't turn up I'll kick your door in.' So I did as I was told, and sat bleary-eyed, sipping and nodding for an hour or so while he held court and demolished two bottles. It has been said that Botham is either your best friend or your worst enemy, and that really is the gist of it. There are no grey areas - things are either black or white. Be loyal to him and he will be loyal to you, but tread on his toes and he will stamp on your head. I was very careful of his feet last Wednesday. They are doing nearly 5 mph for 22 days as he wends his way round the British coast from Liverpool to Somerset and one frightening sore - about the size of a bath plug - had formed on his right heel. This is hardly surprising considering the speed he walks and the number of paces a day - about 36,000 by my calculation. (Two years ago Gary Lineker walked with him but could not keep up. Footballers are, of course, only used to 90 minutes' exercise at a time.) During the course of this, his seventh trek round the towns and villages of his homeland, Botham completed 3,000 miles and passed the Pounds 3m figure for sums raised on behalf of leukaemia research. Why does he do it? Heroism, insanity and compassion might be a reasonable summation. He loves the adulation from the public - the blue-rinsed old ladies, the housewives in bare feet, the classes of schoolchildren cheering at the side of the road - and they love to idolise him even if they fail to identify him. 'Which one is he?' cried a woman in the doorway of a hairdresser's as the caravan of tracksuited figures marched past. Botham's support cast of dedicated volunteers ensures the success of the campaign. Two friends set up a stall to sell merchandise ahead of the party, while Gerry, his father-in-law, announces that 'the greatest sportsman in the world will be passing in five minutes' over a loudspeaker. Mike Gatting is accompanying Botham for two weeks and takes on the task of directing the traffic that builds up behind the entourage. At dinner that evening, he is fined 50p for impersonating a policeman. Other helpers dish out food at regular intervals (there is no stopping even to sign autographs until the day's destination is reached). People with buckets rush about collecting loose change from pedestrians and motorists and a mobile bank follows behind to stash away the takings of about Pounds 9,000 a day. Botham's wife, Kath, beavers away ensuring everything runs smoothly. She is the only person who really knows him; his one true, totally forgiving friend. Over-zealous women almost swoon as he passes, others rush up wailing 'Oooh, I'll give a fiver for a kiss.' Journalists who privately ridicule him dare not do so in print. If you make fun of his portly appearance or poor timekeeping, he returns it with interest. Any mockery is repelled with the usual 'well, how many test wickets did you take then?' He enjoys the banter and he rarely comes second. Underneath the incredible hulk, with calves the width of sewage pipes, there is genuine humility. On the walk he looks after ailing colleagues and makes good-natured sounds and motions whenever someone drops money in the bucket, no matter how much. His autobiography, a best-seller, contains laborious accounts of test series with precious little insight - it is a feature of great sportsmen that they have poor recall of momentous achievements. But among the chaff there are touching, emotional passages about his family and friends, and the remorse he feels for everything he has thrown at his wife, mentally and physically. How has their marriage withstood those 20 years of trial and torment? 'The answer is: it's all down to Kath,' he admits. The public support he receives on his travels underlines the fact that he is truly a people's hero. To them, his mistakes, his relatively humble background, his occasionally misdirected impulses make him seem more human, and therefore more likeable than a Nick Faldo or a Nigel Mansell. Some elements of the press seem him in a different light, and write things that sometimes turn him purple with rage. At such times he would be wise to remember the words of Dr Johnson: 'A fly sir, may sting a stately horse and make him wince. But one is but an insect, the other a horse still.'</p>

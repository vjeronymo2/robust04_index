			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PLAN TO SAVE WATER SHOULDN'T BE USED TO DENY PEOPLE HOMES  </P> <P> It was interesting to read Phillip Weissburg's letter (Letters to the Times,  April 29) in which he blames the current water shortage on the fact that Orange  County Supervisors have not made any attempt to slow the growth in South  County. The writer then urges Supervisor Thomas F. Riley to "offer a law to  provide for an immediate building moratorium as they have in Santa Barbara  County, until the problem passes."  </P> <P> Weissburg conveniently fails to mention the severe water problem, far worse  than anything we have in Orange County, that Santa Barbara is suffering from  now. Weissburg apparently does not know or chooses to ignore the fact that  Santa Barbara has tried to restrict growth by limiting water supply. Sadly,  this policy of limiting water supply has resulted in the crisis that Santa  Barbara is now facing.  </P> <P> It would be very instructive to Weissburg if he were to read the article in the  Opinion Section of the Times by William Kahrl, entitled "Water, Water  Everywhere . . . (April 29)" in which Kahrl points out that only about 4% of  all water deliveries are being used in homes.  </P> <P> There are many ways in which water can be conserved but using it as a weapon to  deprive Californians of home ownership should not be one of them.  </P> <P> ZAC SIDAWI  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

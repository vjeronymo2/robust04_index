			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / PepsiCo shares drop9% over price war Shares in PepsiCo, US maker of the soft drink Pepsi-Cola, lost 9 per cent of their value by the close of trade yesterday, after the company shocked Wall Street with news that a cola price war had broken out in its domestic market. PepsiCo fell Dollars 3 1/4 to close at Dollars 31 1/2 while Coca-Cola dropped Dollars  7/8 to finish at Dollars 40 3/4 . PepsiCo warned that second-quarter profits would be flat because of the inroads being made into the US cola market by Cott, the fast-growing Canadian maker of low-cost, store-branded foods and drinks. Cott recently sparked a row in the UK by supplying J. Sainsbury, the country's biggest retailer, with a store-branded cola that looks and tastes similar to Coca-Cola but sells at roughly half the price. Coca-Cola accused Sainsbury of trying to pass off Cott's product as 'the real thing'. PepsiCo's announcement left investors worried because it called to mind last year's 'Marlboro Friday', when Philip Morris, US manufacturer of Marlboro cigarettes, slashed prices in response to cut-price competition. The development also reinforced worries on Wall Street about the true worth of brands at a time when value-conscious consumers seem inclined to switch away from famous-name products if they feel they can get the same quality at a lower price. Cott is the largest supplier of store-branded soft drinks in North America. The company has begun to spread outside North America to South Africa and Australia, and signed an agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK that should allow it to distribute its products throughout Europe.

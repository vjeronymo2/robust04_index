			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Letter: Bundesbank only advanced day when UK bit devaluation bullet Sir, The whingeing about the Bundesbank and its president, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, has been taken to excess. Britain's economic woes are of its own making. The government's monolithic handling of economic policy, while worthy in its goals, has been based on false parameters, not least the D-Mark rate at which sterling entered the ERM. The Bundesbank and Mr Schlesinger deserve our thanks. The Bundesbank lowered interest rates. If I remember correctly, that is what the 'economic scribblers' and others in Britain had been pleading the Bank to do for months. Mr Schlesinger's statements merely advanced the day when the government had to bite the 'sterling-devaluation' bullet. He has helped to stop the current bout of cancer which, had it continued, may have proved terminal for both the government and British industry. Neil Jamieson, Kaiserstrasse 26, 5300 Bonn 1, Germany</p>

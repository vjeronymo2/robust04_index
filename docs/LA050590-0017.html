			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON'S UNESCO BOYCOTT  </P> <P> Congratulations on your editorial. I too, along with most Americans, have been  deeply disappointed in UNESCO.  </P> <P> The United Nations, which began on such an idealistic and optimistic note, has  ended up anything but that.  </P> <P> UNESCO, its "educational, scientific and cultural" organization, is just  another example of good Western intentions corrupted and gone astray.  </P> <P> Instead of the neutral organization working for world peace and understanding  as originally envisioned, it has become a mere propaganda machine for the  political and military aspirations of the communist and the totalitarian  elements of the Third World. Along with this, anti-American and anti-Western  attacks are common.  </P> <P> As pointed out in your editorial, UNESCO is so blatantly anti-Israel and  pro-Palestinian, that any credibility it may have once had in helping to bring  peace to the Middle East has been apparently totally lost.  </P> <P> Let's continue to support America's and the United Kingdom's decision to refuse  financial support until the original purpose is re-established.  </P> <P> IRVING E. FRIEDMAN  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

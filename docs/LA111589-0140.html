			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE YELLOWJACKETS BUZZ FROM ONE STYLE TO ANOTHER;  </P> <P> JAZZ: POPULAR BAND, APPEARING THURSDAY AT THE COACH HOUSE, CREDITS CHANGES TO  GROWTH, NOT AN IDENTITY CRISIS.  </P> <P> The Yellowjackets have an identity crisis. Well . . . not exactly a crisis --  more like a minor confusion.  </P> <P> In the last few years, the popular four-piece band -- which appears at the  Coach House in San Juan Capistrano on Thursday -- has won Grammy awards in the  rhythm-and-blues as well as the jazz fusion categories. Their current album,  "The Spin," is filled with straight-ahead jazz blowing, a marked contrast from  the music on "Shades" -- music which, despite its Grammy award, was described  by bassist Jimmy Haslip as "fusion disco."  </P> <P> In their earliest years, when the band came into existence as a backup unit for  Robben Ford, the sound was guitar- and blues-centered. When Ford left for a  solo career after the first two albums, the Yellowjackets' identity drifted in  and out of focus until the addition of saxophonist Marc Russo brought a frothy,  pop-jazz feeling to the ensemble.  </P> <P> But the 'Jackets' current well-integrated, strongly improvisation-oriented  sound didn't really emerge until drummer William Kennedy replaced Ricky Lawson  in 1986.  </P> <P> Perhaps understandably, the players do not exactly revel in retracing the  styles that have coursed through the band's 10-year history.  </P> <P> "I wish we could forget about all the changing personnel and the different  labels," said pianist Russell Ferrante in a conversation last week.  </P> <P> "I'd like to get back to the simple question, 'Does the music speak to you,  does it inspire you, does it do something to you that makes you think about the  world or yourself?' Because when I'm composing, I'm not thinking about  categories, or this or that. I'm just concentrating on finding out about what I  have inside myself that I really want to express."  </P> <P> Haslip, however, pointed out that pure self-expression is not always as easy as  it seems. "To be perfectly honest about it," he explained, "being placed in  different categories has been useful to us.  </P> <P> "Jazz is not really a popular idiom around the world. People don't seem to be  willing to sit down and listen to it. They think it's some kind of wild Cecil  Taylor record or something. So, in that respect, being known only by that label  can be harmful.  </P> <P> "On the other hand, we really do believe in jazz, so it's a kind of a  double-edged sword. You want to be true to the art, you want to come up with  something adventurous, but if no one's going to listen to it, well, then what?  Do you continue to pursue some form of music that no one's interested in, or do  you try to perform for the masses?  </P> <P> "It's a tough question, and it's one that we deal with every time we go into  the studio. Usually what wins out is that we're true to the art. We just play  what we're honestly feeling and hope that it'll connect with a large audience.  So far, at least, we've been pretty lucky at doing just that."  </P> <P> Despite his distaste for categories, Ferrante acknowledged that the group has  made a strong evolutionary change in the last few years.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt that the music has gotten more improvisationally focused and  more rhythmically elastic, especially since since William Kennedy joined the  band on drums -- and that's for the last three albums. And a good part of that  has been the move toward a more acoustic sound on the current album."  </P> <P> Interestingly, the music on "The Spin" was initially conceived with the thought  of having the Yellowjackets record with producer-arranger Claus Ogermann. "We  were really thinking of placing the band in an orchestral setting," Ferrante  said, "but Ogermann's schedule was too busy and things didn't work out, at  least not this time. But I think the acoustic sound of the album really was  influenced by the thought of working with a large orchestra."  </P> <P> As the Yellowjackets approach the end of their current tour, the prospect of  making a new recording looms on the horizon. And with it, once again, the old,  nagging question of musical identity.  </P> <P> Haslip viewed the problem with characteristic directness: "Hey, we'll write the  music, perform it to our best ability, play it from the heart as honestly as we  can, and that's about all we can do."  </P> <P> Ferrante, the Yellowjackets' primary composer, took a somewhat more pensive  pint of view. "Well, at the end of the tour," he said, "I guess we'll all just  collapse for a while, and then start writing again. Every time we've done that,  I've been amazed at how new things start bubbling up, and how there's just no  telling what will come up next.  </P> <P> "But that's what feels right to me, and maybe that's why there've been so many  changes and so many categories. Maybe the real identity of the Yellowjackets  simply comes from our desire to see where the music will take us."  </P> <P>  The Yellowjackets will play Thursday at 8 p.m. at the Coach House, 33157  Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. Tickets: $19.50. Information: (714)  496-8930.  </P> <P> </P></p>

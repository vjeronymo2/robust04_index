			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Markets: In search of the perfect Pep - Serious Money THIS WEEK produced a breakthrough in the world of personal equity plans  - the guaranteed Pep. A lot of people have been disappointed with their Peps. Devised by the then chancellor Nigel Lawson as a means of encouraging wider share ownership, the first schemes were launched in 1987, just in time for the Crash and for five years of meagre profits for equity investors. In the early years of PEPs, unit and investment trust plans had very small maxima, so most people were directed into 'managed' plans, in which stockbrokers chose a limited number of shares. Performance has been mixed. Unfortunately, many people leapt at the 'tax-free' element of Peps without considering too carefully what those tax advantages might be. The exemption from capital gains tax is handy for high net worth investors, but only 165,000 made enough profits to pay CGT in 1991. The income tax exemption may also be not as good as it sounds. If a portfolio yields a gross 4 per cent, a basic rate taxpayer saves just 1 per cent in tax in the first year from the exemption. Even on a full annual allowance of Pounds 6,000, that represents a gain of just Pounds 60. That gain could be wiped out in one hour's share trading - and it can also easily be swallowed up by charges. Small wonder that dissatisfaction is widespread. But the good news is that the industry seems to be trying to offer investors better value. Over the last few months, a number of fund managers have cut initial charges. One of the most recent was Murray Johnstone, which has an initial charge of only 1 per cent on its unit trust PEPs, with no extra fees; and an initial charge on its investment trust Pep of Pounds 35 plus VAT. Legal &amp; General joined the throng this week with a cut in its initial charges to 3 per cent on a range of plans, with five profiles: recovery, income, growth, worldwide and smaller companies. Each is based on an individual unit trust except for the growth profile, split 50 per cent between Legal &amp; General's equity and recovery unit trusts. The annual charge on Legal &amp; General's trusts is 1.5 per cent, higher than some other managers' plans. This could hamper performance over the long term, which might cancel out the benefit of the lower initial charge. How have the trusts performed? Over the one, two and three years to October 1, the Recovery fund has been in the top quartile (best 25 per cent) of the UK growth sector. The smaller companies fund has been in the top half of its sector over all the periods from one to seven years. The equity income and worldwide growth funds performed less well: they have below average performances over one, two, three, five and seven years. The equity fund is in the middle with mostly above average performances, but a poorer record over the last year. But the more innovative element of Legal &amp; General's package is the guarantee. This plan invests in the Recovery trust and Legal &amp; General guarantees that, after five years, if your holding is not worth the amount you originally invested, it will pay you the difference. Most of the guaranteed products sold to date have had three flaws. The first is inflexibility; the investor can be penalised if money is withdrawn before the guaranteed date. The second concerns tax. In some cases, all the gain has been subject to income tax; in other cases, higher rate taxpayers will face a charge equal to the difference between the two tax bands (currently 15 per cent). Profits on conventional equity investments are subject only to capital gains tax. But possibly the biggest snag with a guaranteed product is lack of income. Not only do most products pay no income at all during their lifetime, but they usually aim to meet only the capital appreciation of the index. The running yield on the market is currently around 4.7 per cent gross, which an investor in the guaranteed product misses. That compounds into a net 19 per cent or so over five years. The Legal &amp; General plan gets round most of these problems. An investor can sell his holding without penalty at any time, although the guarantee only applies at the five year anniversary. All profit and income is tax free. And the investor benefits from the yield on the trust, currently 3.71 per cent. But life is never perfect. Most guaranteed products use futures or options to track the index, so an investor is bound to get a performance close to that of the market (minus the income). Legal &amp; General's Recovery trust could perform badly and an investor's return could be well below average. On the other hand, this is precisely the risk that investors take when they invest in all other non-index tracking Peps. The second snag is that the guaranteed Pep carries an initial charge of 5.5 per cent, rather than the 3 per cent on the rest of the range. There are no other charges, however, and 5.5 per cent is not out of line with much of the rest of the unit trust market. We have not quite reached my ideal. That would be an index-tracking Pep with no front end charges, a low annual charge and a guarantee. But, step by step, we are getting there.</p>

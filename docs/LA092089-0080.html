			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ NOTES : TALBERT IN BENEFIT FOR VISITING NURSES ASSN.; RECORDING ARTS'  ROAST AT SPORTSMEN'S LODGE  </P> <P> In what could easily be described as the best kind of home cooking,  composer-arranger Tom Talbert leads his septet in the living room of his Laguna  Beach home this Sunday in a benefit for the Visiting Nurses Assn. of Orange  County Hospice.  </P> <P> The 4 p.m. performance -- dubbed Jazz in the Afternoon -- marks the fourth time  in as many years that Talbert has opened up his doors for the association, a  volunteer organization that provides emotional support and periodic respite to  the terminally ill and their families.  </P> <P> "I can't think of a more worthwhile charity," said Talbert, who'll play pieces  from his "Louisiana Suite" (Sea Breeze) LP. "VNA has a tough time because  people don't want to talk about dying, so the organization doesn't get a lot of  exposure."  </P> <P> "Tom supports us tremendously," said Linda Conway, VNA's volunteer coordinator.  "Last year we had 155 people attend."  </P> <P> "I have a big house," Talbert said. "It has good acoustics and we get such a  good audience. They're very attentive and involved and that affects the group.  It's always been very good musically and a lot of fun."  </P> <P> The benefit, for which a donation of $40 is requested, kicks off the  association's annual "Light Up a Life" fund-raiser, where the public "can honor  loved ones, both those living and those in memory, by placing a light on our  35-foot tree, which is lighted outside our office in the City of Orange  throughout December," said Conway.  </P> <P> Information: (714) 771-1209.  </P> <P> Such dubious honors as "best phone hog," "best studio tan" and "most impressive  warm-up (instrumental)" will be awarded Sunday at the Sportsmen's Lodge in  North Hollywood, 1 p.m., when the L.A. Chapter of the National Academy of  Recording Arts and Sciences presents the first "Yo Cat" roast.  </P> <P> The program -- emceed by the Don Rickles of jazz, trumpeter-comedian Jack  Sheldon -- will both salute and ridicule musicians who make their living  primarily in the town's recording studios. Tom Scott, musical director of "The  Pat Sajak Show," will be the roastee-of-honor, and musical interludes will be  provided by singer-comedienne Marie Cain, among others.  </P> <P> "Yo Cat" admission is $15 for academy members, $20 for non-members.  Information: (818) 843-8253.  </P> <P> To support the International Assn. of Jazz Appreciation's "Jazz Goes to School"  program, bassist Leslie Baker and tenorman Ricky Woodard will lead quartets at  5 p.m. this Sunday and next at Webster's Restaurant in downtown Los Angeles.  Cover charge is $8 for non-members, $5 for members, with musicians admitted  free. "Jazz Goes to School" will again offer performances by local jazz  musicians in Los Angeles elementary and junior high schools in January.  Information: (213) 469-5589.  </P> <P> A week ago Sunday it was Bob Cooper Day here in Los Angeles. Two days before  that, the mellow-toned saxophonist's trumpet-playing buddy, Snooky Young, was  similarly feted by his hometown of Dayton, Ohio.  </P> <P> "Yeah," said the longtime member of "The Tonight Show" orchestra, "they gave me  a key to the city and a proclamation from the mayor, and then Bob (Cooper),  (pianist) Ross (Tompkins) and (singer) Ernie Andrews and I, plus a couple of  local musicians, gave a concert at the Dayton Art Institute. It turned out  great, with a full house and people really responding."  </P> <P> The 71-year-old Young, whose most recent release -- "In a Mellotone"  (Fantasy/Galaxy) -- is co-led with Cooper and features Andrews, takes off this  weekend to play a jazz party in Aspen, Colo.  </P></p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Company News (This Week): Long distance call in place despite local difficulties - Vodafone The mobile communications group Vodafone has been pushed off its pedestal, its shares falling from an all-time peak of 637p in February to 517p at the end of last week. But analysts expect its 1993-94 pre-tax profits, due for release tomorrow, to be in the range of Pounds 350m-Pounds 370m and its medium-term prospects are still seen as healthy. At Pounds 360m, Robert Fleming's mid-way projection, Vodafone would be 12 per cent ahead of last year's Pounds 322m, with earnings per share of 24.2p up 9 per cent. 'The UK cellular market is becoming more competitive, but Vodafone is holding its own,' says Mr Kevin Langford, Fleming's mobile communications analyst. 'The main concern is about prospects for its new digital networks and the expansion of its overseas business.' Vodafone's shares have been depressed by the recent malaise in the telecoms sector, with added volatility caused by the launch of two new national cellular networks in the last eight months - Mercury One-2-One and Hutchison Microtel's Orange. None the less, Vodafone enjoyed record numbers of new connections in both December and March, and now boasts 1.2m UK subscribers. Slow growth in its new UK digital networks has not mattered while capacity on the analogue network remained abundant, but analysts are looking for evidence of a viable Vodafone strategy to move customers across to its enhanced - but more expensive - GSM digital network. Vodafone is well on the way to realising its goal of acquiring overseas franchises with an aggregate population equal to the UK, adjusting for income and the company's share of consortia. But it has yet to make much return on overseas investments.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Oruro, 20 Nov--The Oruro Regional Development  Corporation (CORDEOR) is striving to achieve the rehabilitation  of Lakes Poopo and Uru Uru, to ensure the survival of the Uru  Muratos, settlers belonging to an indigenous tribe living on the  shores of those lakes.    The current contamination and salinity of Lake Poopo's  waters  is threatening extinction for the region's flora and fauna. This  has evoked concern among the indigenous settlers, who are  suffering from a lack of food for their subsistence.    The CORDEOR president, Marcelo Arzabe Vasquez, explained to  PRESENCIA that the rehabilitation of Lake Poopo and other nearby  lakes is an imminent event. It is based on the plan being  carried out with the Joint Bolivian-Peruvian Commission for the  Development of the Lake Titicaca Integrated Zone (Subcomilagos),  which includes the rehabilitation of the upper and lower basins  of the Desaguadero River.    He remarked: "This plan has been handled with special  dedication, because we are aware that we must guarantee the  natural habitat for the lives of the indigenous tribes and  nations, particularly the Uru Muratos who make their living from  fishing and hunting on Lake Poopo. Their subsistence fishing is  nonexistent, and this is a major concern of our administration."  <H5>  Lack of Attention </H5>   Daniel Moricio Choque, leader of the Uru Muratos, for his  part, explained that they know that Lake Poopo's waters are  contaminated, and yet this situation does not concern any  authorities. He claimed this to be so despite the fact that the  atherine [a mackerel species] fishing catch in 1992 did not  exceed 500 kg, compared to 1990's total of 3,000 tons, and  accounting for 50 percent of the national production.    During 1991, the atherine production amounted to 2,600 tons.  In 1992, 90 percent of the fishing fauna disappeared, and in  1993 there is nothing to fish for, as the indigenous leader  explained. He said that this proved to be a difficult situation  of those living in the Murato settlements.    The indigenous residents feed themselves with wild ducks  from  the area but, owing to the water's salinity, they too are  becoming extinct. This prompts the prediction that there will  soon be total famine.    Currently engaged in raising Aymara sheep, the Uru Muratos  are hoping to obtain a small territory in which to devote  themselves to farming.    The situation being experienced in the settlements of  Punaca,  Tinta Maria, Llapallapani, and Willaneque is tragic, because the  inactivity caused by the reduction in Lake Poopo's water level  and the lack of fish is causing massive migration. This has left  the communities as ghost towns, and the schools that existed  have been closed. They are waiting for attention from the  national authorities to alleviate this situation, which is now  added to the poverty and misery of those who have sustained the  fishing activity for centuries.  <H5>  Rehabilitation </H5>   To achieve the rehabilitation of Lake Poopo, consideration  was given to a study made in 1985, warning of the lake's  contamination with heavy metals. The study, conducted by Great  Britain's Overseas Development Administration (ODA), announced  the results of the chemical and spectrophotometric analyses of  samples of water, plants, sediments, and fish from the Poopo  Basin.    The analyses have made it possible to establish the fact  that  this lake was highly saline (in 1985), particularly in the  south, where the salinity exceeded 70 percent. These figures are  higher than those recorded at Lake Moon, California, one of the  best documented saline lakes.    The evidence from all the water, plant, silt, and fish  samples indicates that there are extraordinarily high  concentrations of all metals in the Poopo Basin.    According to the study, the concentration of dissolved  metals  in the lake comes from the largest deposits in central Bolivia,  such as the Poopo, Monserrat, Avicaya, and Huanuni mines,  located no farther than 20 km from the lake.    The strongest evidence of contamination comes from the San  Juan Sora Sora River, containing high concentrations of a wide  range of metals. It is known that the levels of many metals are  toxic for fish, and levels exceeding those permitted have been  recorded.</p>

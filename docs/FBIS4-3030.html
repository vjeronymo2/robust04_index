			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 16 (XINHUA) -- Portuguese Prime  Minister Anibal Cavaco Silva arrived here today for a four-day  official visit following his week-long visit to China's mainland  from April 10 to 16.    The prime minister's entourage includes over 60 leading  Portuguese businessmen.    On his arrival, Silva said that he has brought good news to  Macao, which has become a symbol of the friendship between the  two peoples of China and Portugal.    He said that during his visit to China's mainland, from the  very beginning to the end, Macao was a very important topic in  the talks he had with senior Chinese leaders.    The Portuguese Government has made great efforts to  safeguard  the prosperity and interest of Macao, so has the Chinese  Government, he said.    The Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, signed between the  governments of China and Portugal in 1987, has been implemented  conscientiously by the two sides through dialog and friendly  cooperation, said the Portugese leader, stressing that such  understanding is the most powerful guarantee of Macao's progress  and development in the future.    During his stay in Macao, Silva will meet with Guo Dongpo,  director of XINHUA NEWS AGENCY Macao Branch, preside over the  opening ceremony of the Macao friendship bridge and visit the  international airport site and other key projects here.</p>

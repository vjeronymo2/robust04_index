			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A hard game to join FORECASTS that a work revolution in the 1980s would leave half the UK's employed population beavering away behind computer screens in their own homes not only proved hopelessly exaggerated but also under-estimated the psychological difficulties of earning a living in the isolation of a private house. 'Working alone at home is very hard, the hardest thing about what I do,' says Michael Seal. 'When I can, I will move into a studio where there will be some inter-action with other people.' Seal designs and makes games from the living room of his flat in Brighton and suffers from the familiar headaches of under-capitalisation and competition from large companies with muscular promotional budgets. 'I often find that shops do not want to take a game that does not have a large amount of advertising behind it.' Seal studied architecture at Brighton Polytechnic but found designing factory units for industrial estates was not intellectually stimulating. Seal, who is 32, had long been interested in geometry, the relationships between shapes and ancient Egyptian architecture. Artefacts in his living room include a large propeller blade and a bullet-shaped fan. One wall is made of a bookcase he built with a secret door and mock temples pillars. In 1988 Seal designed a game called Altar. He cordoned-off part of his bathroom as a workshop, constructing moulds out of card and wax for the pieces and hand-carving the wooden board for the game which has some similarities to chess. His company, Seventh Seal, started selling the game in local design shops and to the game shop chain of Virgin, to which he had shown a prototype. A local company he found in Yellow Pages produced the fibre-glass resin pieces while Seal made the boards. He learnt screen-printing and packaged the product in the flat. The game was ready in December of that year and for Christmas Seal generated a turnover of just Pounds 500, selling games retailing at Pounds 30 and costing about Pounds 8 to make. In 1989, Seal fitted kitchens and constructed furniture to make a living while he designed a new game, Axiom, which is now his main bread-winner. This is a three-dimensional game made of cubes shaped with hollows and bulges and, like Altar, is based on strategy with no element of luck. Seal says turnover, largely from this game, has risen from Pounds 4,000 in 1989 to Pounds 20,000 in 1991 and about Pounds 30,000 last year, during which he sold some 2,000 Axioms. This turnover is generated from selling to shops at half the retail price of Pounds 20 and to direct customers at a Pounds 2 discount from the retail price. Direct sales are mainly at the Camden open-air market in London, a weekend stall costs Pounds 60 to rent. Seal, though, finds the business a struggle and not just because of the recession. 'The game looks strange because there is no board and it can appear very complex even though it is quite easy to learn.' The packaging was a mistake: a slight upright box. 'That did not make it look like a Pounds 20 game. I've re-designed the packaging now so it comes in a flat box and looks much more substantial.' Using Yellow Pages, Seal picked toy, gift and design shops around Britain, visiting them to demonstrate the game. Reactions were often less than positive. 'The Virgin people were very nice and took the game but some shop managers will not sell games unless those games have big advertising budgets. I was in one shop and a customer came in to buy a football and bought the game there and then right under the nose of the manager. But the manager still wouldn't take it.' Seal's operation is too small to take advantage of cheap manufacturing in the far east. 'It costs Pounds 2.50 here to have all the plastic pieces made for one game of Axiom. I had a quote from Hong Kong to do all those pieces for 33 US cents but we are not big enough to use that. Large game makers can get their products made for virtually nothing and spend a large part of their sales on promotion.' He advertises little except in the 'house' magazine of Mensa. Sales in the UK are not as good as Seal hoped but two German businessmen who saw Axiom at Camden last year have bought 600 to sell in Germany and have been discussing a joint venture in which they would sell the game in continental Europe. 'Germans are big buyers of thinking abstract games, much bigger than in the UK, so I have been hopeful about this.' Seal has been approached by a large British games maker interested in buying the rights to Axiom. This would scupper plans for a tie-up in Germany. But, the terms the suitor has offered so far are not satisfactory. Seventh Seal is also about to market a puzzle. All Seal's income now comes from the business but it is only generating a very moderate living for its owner. Seal would like to devote all his time to designing games, leaving production to someone else. He also contemplates the possibility that he might be forced to return to architecture.

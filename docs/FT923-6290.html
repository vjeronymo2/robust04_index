			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on currency, corporate fears A weak dollar, fears of poor interim results and more bad news from Scandinavia kept the downward pressure on continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT began the week with further declines across the board. The chemical sector was particularly weak as investors sold in anticipation of disappointing first-half results. The FAZ index lost 4.78 to 593.28 at midsession while the DAX index fell 21.28 or 1.4 per cent to 1,498.74, its lowest close since August 1991. German shares extended their decline in the post-bourse with the index estimated to have fallen a further 1.3 per cent. Turnover was unavailable. Hoechst, which shed DM7.90 to DM231.80, was also affected by the dollar's weakness because of its US exposure; Bayer fell DM7.80 to DM255.80 and BASF finished the session down DM4.30 to DM213.90. Specialty chemical stocks also fell, with Schering dropping DM14.50 to DM689.50 and Henkel DM15 lower at DM575. Reports that the cartel office may take action against banks for paying low interest rates on savings accounts weighed on the sector. Deutsche Bank lost DM5 to DM611, Dresdner Bank was down DM5.80 at DM319.20 and Commerzbank slipped DM4 to DM219. PARIS dropped 3.1 per cent as selling on the last day of the account pushed the CAC-40 index down by 54.47 to 1,689.71 in turnover of FFr2bn. Dealers expect a technical rebound today. Euro Disney dropped FFr5.25 or 7.1 per cent to FFr68.25, as bad sentiment towards the stock persisted following a broker sell note last week. There were also fears that the theme park operator will not pay a dividend on 1992 results. UAP lost FFr17.10 to FFr356.90 on worries about the consequences of its stake in Hafnia, the troubled Danish insurer. The stock also fell following a report from James Capel underweighting the French insurance sector. Elf fell FFr6.40 to FFr309.80 ahead of its interim results which were were announced after the close. The drop in net profit to FFr3.34bn from FFr5.22bn in the year-ago period came in at the lower end of forecasts. MILAN fell as the lira slid further against the mark. Rumours of brokers in difficulty also weighed on sentiment. The Comit index fell 6.06 to 400.06 in turnover estimated at L50bn after Friday's L46.3bn. Banca Commerciale Italiana, the state-controlled bank which surged last week on rumours of a private sector takeover bid, dropped L87 or 3.4 per cent to L2,438 as the speculative fizz evaporated. OSLO plunged 5.9 per cent, following the suspension of shares in the troubled insurer, Uni Storebrand. The all-share index fell 19.14 to 305.20, its lowest level since November 1988, in thin turnover of NKr153m. Uni Storebrand shares, which closed at an all-time low of NKr13.30 on Friday, were suspended as the company tried to secure new capital. STOCKHOLM plunged 4 per cent as domestic interest rates continued to rise. The Affarsvarlden General Index fell 31.6 to 750.2, its lowest close since February 1988, in turnover of SKr486m after SKr382m. Skandia dropped SKr6 or 8.8 per cent to SKr62 on news that Uni Storebrand, which owns 28.3 per cent of the Swedish company, had been suspended. COPENHAGEN's KFX index fell 1.90 to a new all-time low of 77.16 in busy trading. ZURICH fell sharply as the SMI index lost 41.3 or 2.3 per cent to 1,726.9. The chemical sector took its cue from Frankfurt with Ciba-Geigy registered shares down SFr16 to SFr631 and Roche certificates SFr80 weaker at SFr3,290. Nestle was one of the day's biggest losers, its bearers down SFr110 or 1.2 per cent to SFr9,020, but off the day's low of SFr8,960. AMSTERDAM followed neighbouring markets lower as the CBS Tendency index closed down 3.7 or 3.3 per cent at 107.8, but volume remained thin. DSM and Akzo lost Fl 2.30 and FL 3.80 respectively to Fl 100.30 and FL 143.30 while Royal Dutch was down Fl 4.70 to Fl 141.00. Daf saw one of the day's biggest falls, losing Fl 1.90 or 10.6 per cent to Fl 16.00. BRUSSELS lost further ground with Banque Bruxelles Lambert off BFr230 or 7 per cent at BFr3,070 and Delhaize down BFr59 to BFr1,486. The Bel-20 index lost 28.30 or 2.5 per cent to 1,085.12 in turnover estimated at BFr900m. MADRID's general index closed down 2.64 at 207.60 in turnover of Pta7bn.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - AUG 24  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                           Hourly changes   Open     10.30am  11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm     3 pm     close  1019.69  1017.99  1017.97  1016.27  1016.70  1013.25  1009.99  1010.52  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         Day's High  1019.98            Day's Low  1009.47  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Aug 21        Aug 20        Aug 19        Aug 18        Aug 17   1039.54       1030.83       1033.91       1035.74       1045.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

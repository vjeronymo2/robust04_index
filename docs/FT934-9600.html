			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / BAA to help set up US-style discount malls BAA, the airports operator, has formed a joint venture with McArthur/Glen, the US property developer, to build six US-style 'factory outlet malls' in the UK at a cost of about Pounds 40m. The venture expects to announce its first two UK sites within a few months, as well as two sites in France. Further UK sites will be developed over three years. If these and the French developments are successful the venture will expand into the rest of continental Europe. 'Outlet malls will prove a very interesting addition to UK retailing,' said Mr Barry Gibson, BAA's retail director. 'You only have to look at what is happening in the food sector to see that British consumers are saying they want value for money.' Factory outlet shops sell surplus and end-of-season stock from branded manufacturers at prices about a third lower than in high streets. Although there are more than 1,100 such shops, malls where the shops are grouped together are relatively new to the UK. Along with warehouse clubs, factory outlet malls have been one of the fastest-growing sectors of US retailing in the past 10 years. The clubs  - also coming to the UK - are sheds in which goods are sold cheaply to fee-paying members. The malls and clubs will put further pressure on existing UK retailers, already facing growing competition from discount retailers. BAA, which runs shopping centres at its seven UK airports and owns Lynton, the property developer, says the venture combines its own retailing and property development skills with McArthur/Glen's experience in the US, where it has 17 malls. While the venture favours out-of-town sites about 20 or 30 miles from population centres for its 150,000 sq ft malls, Mr Gibson said he was aware the government's new planning guidance favouring town centre and edge-of-town sites could make it difficult to obtain planning permission. But he said agreement was near on the first two sites, and he was confident others could be found.</p>

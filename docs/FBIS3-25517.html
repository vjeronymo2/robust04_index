These same sources reported that Mr. Wade and  Mr. Savane, secretary generals of the Senegalese Democratic  Party (PDS) and the African Party for Democracy and Socialism  (PADS), respectively, were arrested at their houses at around  2100. Their arrest comes 48 hours after violence in Dakar that  resulted in the deaths of six persons, including five policemen,  on 16 February, following an opposition rally.    Senegalese Interior Minister Djibo Ka said yesterday evening  that the "incitement to violence" began at a rally organized by  the Coordination of Democratic Forces (CFD), an umbrella  organization for five opposition parties, including the PDS and  PADS. He also stated that "more than 30 demonstrators had been  arrested" after the riots and that he had been given  "indications as to the instigators of this criminal act."  [passage omitted]</p>

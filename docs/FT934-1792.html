			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / PLO warns that peace process could be frozen A senior member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation warned yesterday the peace process would be frozen if Israel did not allow Palestinians to control the border crossing points in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho after Israeli troops withdraw. Mr Yasir Abed Rabbo, a PLO executive committee member, said in Tunis: 'Either there will be a true Israeli withdrawal and true Palestinian control on land and passages, or we will face an Israeli interpretation of the peace deal less than autonomy; that means hindering the peace process.' In that case, 'the peace process will be frozen.' In Jerusalem, Mr Gad Ben-Ari, spokesman for Premier Yitzhak Rabin, said it was impossible for Israel to compromise. 'It was made clear to PLO chairman Yassir Arafat that if we do not have full control over the borders, bridges and checkpoints, we would have no control over who is entering Israel. That is why this is inconceivable.' Mr Ben-Ari denied an Israeli press report that Mr Rabin would refuse to meet Mr Arafat until he backed down, but said no date had yet been fixed for the two men to meet. After last Sunday's summit in Cairo failed, the two leaders said they hoped to meet again in 10 days to iron out their difficulties. Israel's foreign minister Shimon Peres suggested in Paris yesterday the possibility of allowing Palestinian observers at the border crossings. 'If it is just a question of a Palestinian presence on the (Jordan River) bridge, I think we can find a solution. But there must be someone responsible for the border. You cannot have one border and two responsibilities.' Mr Peres reported progress in economic co-operation talks between the area of future Palestinian self-rule and Israel. 'I think the Palestinians agree with us today to create a market economy, an open economy with no border with free movement of goods and trade between the two of us.' Problems remained over the territories' Currency.</p>

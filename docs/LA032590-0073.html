			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND WHAT IF 'NASTY' SHOWS UP AT YOUR HOUSE?  </P> <P> What should parents do if they catch their young teen-agers with a copy of 2  Live Crew's sexually explicit "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album? Should they be  alarmed and ban the record from the house, or think of it as harmless  experimentation and ignore the situation?  </P> <P> The Times posed these questions to Mark DeAntonio, unit director of the  Adolescent Inpatient Unit at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. DeAntonio, an  assistant clinical professor who's familiar with 2 Live Crew's music, counsels  families daily on such matters.  </P> <P> "If your 12-year-old daughter brings home a 2 Live Crew record and shows it to  you in a provocative way, as they often will, the answer is not to freak out,  but to sit down, listen to it together, talk to your kid and find out what they  think about it," he said. "Make sure your values about violence and sex are  made absolutely crystal clear at home, because in families with good  communication, these things don't become problems.  </P> <P> "In families where there are problems, I think there is a tendency to blame  external things such as records or movies or whatever. To put it into  historical perspective, people in the 1940s said Frank Sinatra provoked sexual  behavior. In the 1950s, Elvis Presley, who did things that we would now  consider remarkably tame, was banned throughout the United States for being too  sexual.  </P> <P> "Things are more sophisticated now, more open, more explicit and the key thing  is not to try to protect your child or shield them, but make sure that you are  communicating your values. So I would see a 12-year-old bringing home this  album not as something to be terrified of, but as an opportunity to discuss  sexual matters directly with your child.  </P> <P> "When we're talking about average adolescents, I think the trap is that the  things you ban tend to become more alluring and tempting to kids.  </P> <P> "Of course what you do depends on the values you feel are important to stress  in your own family. If parents really find it objectionable, I think they  should set limits around it. Be direct about what will be tolerated in the  home. But make sure they're limits you can follow through with. I don't think  you should allow your kid to do something that is really disturbing to you, but  I wouldn't be rigid about any response.  </P> <P> "I don't think that listening to 2 Live Crew is going to make anybody sexually  promiscuous. Kids are more influenced by the values of their parents and older  siblings and peers. "Whether parents like it or not, kids are exposed to  sexually explicit ideas earlier these days and they need to discuss these  issues with their child." Chuck Philips  </P></p>

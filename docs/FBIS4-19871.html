			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Russian Trade Revives"] </F>   [Text] Over half of Finland's imports from Russia still  consist of some form of energy, according to the Customs  Department's trade statistics for last year.    Trade between Finland and Russia last year again rose above  its 1991 level, and Finnish exports to the East consisted mainly  of machinery, equipment, and means of transportation. Those  exports exceeded 6 billion markkas in value and accounted for a  total of 4.5 percent of our foreign trade. For its part, the  value of Finnish imports from Russia was close to 8 billion  markkas.    Exports of machinery and equipment to Russia were twice what  they were the year before, accounting in total for nearly half  of Finnish exports. The most important single export items were  telephone and radio sets.    Food exports to Russia tripled last year, and one-fourth of  all Finnish food exports go to Russia. Beverage and food exports  exceeded 1 billion markkas last year, and nearly one-fifth of  those exports consisted of fruit and vegetables.    The slowest growth last year was recorded by the textile and  garment industry. Clothing purchases for Russia totaled just  over 120 million markkas, while shoes accounted for nearly 110  million markkas.    Energy continues to dominate Finnish imports from Russia,  although petroleum quantities are below the levels achieved  during the peak years in the late 1980's. Petroleum imports last  year were at the same level as in 1992: approximately 3 billion  metric tons, or about one-third of total imports.    Imports of natural gas have increased and account for  one-fifth of total imports, while coal stands just under 5  percent and direct electric current accounts for nearly 10  percent of imports. Timber accounts for over 10 percent of total  imports. Timber imports, mostly in the form of logs, are rising  steadily.</p>

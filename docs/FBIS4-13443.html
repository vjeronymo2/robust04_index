			<p>BFN     [Text] Tunis, 19 Apr (MENA)--Palestinian leader Yasir  'Arafat has expressed his belief that the current round of  Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo will produce an agreement  between Israel and the PLO toward the end of this week on the  transfer of authority to the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and  Jericho, in accordance with the Declaration of Principles signed  by the two sides in Washington.    In statements to the Tunisian newspaper AL-RA'I AL-'AMM  published today, 'Arafat said that the obstacles and hindrances  that the Israeli Government created for the implementation of  the Declaration of Principles over the past few months is due to  its desire to spoil the joy of the Palestinians as they return  to a part of their homeland which has been under occupation for  over a quarter of a century.    Despite all its procrastination, Yitzhaq Rabin's government  is unable to face the consequences of failing to implement the  Oslo agreement, 'Arafat stated.    There are four extremist groups [tanzimat mutatarrifah]  within the Israeli military who are doing everything they can to  obstruct the implementation of the Declaration of Principles.  These groups see the Declaration of Principles as being against  their interests, 'Arafat said.    'Arafat said that hectic preparations are under way to bring  thousands of Palestinian fighters from Tunisia, Yemen, and Sudan  to Gaza and Jericho. He added that schools, hospitals, and  other public facilities will be built in Jericho which has  insufficient supply of such services due to its sparse  population.    'Arafat said that 1,300 Palestinian families are expected to  arrive in Jericho in the next four months.</p>

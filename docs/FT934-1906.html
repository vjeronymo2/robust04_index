			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Northern Electric advances 28% Northern Electric, the power distributor for the north-east of England, announced a 28 per cent increase to Pounds 52.6m in pre-tax profits for the half year to September 30. The interim dividend is lifted by 17.5 per cent to 7.4p, although the company said that was partly to reduce the disparity between the two halves of the year. The underlying increase was 15 per cent, said Mr David Morris, executive chairman. Northern is splitting the role of chairman and chief executive. Its decision to promote Mr Tony Hadfield from managing director to chief executive from April 1 means that only one of the 12 regional electricity companies, Norweb, has a combined chairman and chief executive. East Midlands split the two jobs last week. Northern's pre-tax result, up from a restated Pounds 41.1m, was achieved on turnover of Pounds 460.7m (Pounds 395.5m). Operating profits advanced from Pounds 40.7m to Pounds 48.3m. Earnings per share worked through 30 per cent ahead at 32.1p (24.7p). The improvement was helped by a 1.4 per cent inc-rease in electricity units distributed, with domestic sales up 4.2 per cent and commercial up 3.6 per cent. Units to industry fell but the rate of decline is slow-ing. Supply profits rose from Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 2.8m as the company reaped the rewards of selling electricity to large customers in the liberalised market outside its area. It claims about 400 sites outside its area on top of the 200 it supplies inside it. Retailing made profits of Pounds 700,000, against a small loss last year. Two more out-of-town superstores had been opened which were trading above expectations, Mr Morris said. Northern has a staff of 4,700 and expects to reduce that by about 3 per cent each year including this. The company has Pounds 28m cash, having started the year with Pounds 39m debt and 9 per cent gearing. It expects to be cash neutral at the year-end. COMMENT Northern's aggressive drive to win customers outside its natural monopoly region marks it out from other regional power companies. It also makes some investors nervous. These results will alleviate the anxieties, with supply profits beginning to show through clearly, and Pounds 8m to Pounds 10m possible for the full year. From April the supply market will become more competitive as an extra 45,000 sites become eligible to choose who supplies their electricity. That will be the real test of Northern's faith in a business where margins are slim at best. In other areas there is little to distinguish Northern from other recs and little to either worry or excite shareholders. At yesterday's close the shares are fairly valued with a prospective dividend of 24.7p producing a yield of about 4.4 per cent.</p>

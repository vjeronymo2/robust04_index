			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Oil predicted 'to remain' at around Dollars 12-Dollars 15 a barrel The widespread perception that oil prices are 'low' may be incorrect, according to a new study which suggests that prices in the Dollars 12-Dollars 15 a barrel range in 1993 money are the long-term norm. Current prices for the benchmark Brent Blend are hovering around the Dollars 16 a barrel level. The report by London brokers Societe Generale Strauss Turnball finds no evidence to suggest that there will be any long-term shortfall in oil. The 'inherent tendency (is) for oil supplies always to exceed demand, irrespective of the rate of growth in oil consumption,' it says. Mr John Toalster, oil analyst and one of the report's authors, said oil supply, rather than demand, was the primary influence on prices. 'This pre-eminence is likely to become even more marked in future,' he said. The study dismisses current fears that a capital shortage among financially-strapped members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries could lead to long-term supply shortages later this decade, when demand is expected to rise strongly as areas such as Europe and Japan move out of recession. Mr Toalster concedes that there could be a temporary 'mismatch' between supply and demand which could push prices up. But he contends that over the longer term there is 'always a tendency for prices to fall.' The report is optimistic that non-Opec output, widely expected to fall in coming years, could be maintained through cost-cutting and the application of new technology. This could further dampen price pressures. The report suggests that trade wars could arise between Opec countries, non-Opec producers and the oil producing countries of the former Soviet Union vying for market share. It also suggests that fuel competition between oil and natural gas is likely to intensify. The historical record shows that oil production has been profitable even at low price levels. The 'wealth, power and prestige' which flows from control of oil reserves ensures the 'rapid and relentless' growth in reserves, a process that is accelerated by advances in technology.</p>

			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Survey of Morocco (2): There's a grinding of teeth in Rabat / A look at relations with the European Union The lack of progress in negotiations for a new and closer relationship with the European Union has become Morocco's greatest frustration. There is an almost audible grinding of teeth in the government offices of Rabat when the subject is brought up. Isolated for long periods of its history, Morocco's economic and social aspirations are firmly fixed on the north, across the 14 kilometres that separate the country from continental Europe. Most of its merchandise trade is already done with the European Union, which accounted last year for 55 per cent of Morocco's imports and 63 per cent of its exports, with the balance heavily in Europe's favour. In some farm products, as much as 90 per cent of Moroccan exports are dependent on the European market. But for Moroccans, relations with the EU are not just a commercial affair, but also a strong political and emotional issue. Negotiations have stalled on a new 'association' or 'partnership' agreement (the title being among the more minor of the questions to be settled). Morocco has had a series of commercial and co-operation agreements with the European community over the past 25 years. In 1987, the year after Spain and Portugal became members, it lodged an application to join, in what officials now describe as 'a political signal'. The application was turned down, with the community clearly unwilling to extend the geographical definition of the EU to the other shore of the Mediterranean. In 1992 Morocco launched a fresh initiative, seeking exploratory talks on a new kind of agreement. Talks on detailed proposals began late last year. But Morocco was bitterly disappointed in its expectations. In Brussels, the Moroccans are criticised for a naive approach to complex EU procedures and for failing to mount an effective lobbying campaign. 'We do not understand this slowness,' complains a government minister in Rabat. Morocco was to have set the model for other countries in their relations with the EU, but it has been overtaken by both Tunisia and Israel, and Egypt is now catching up. The frustration steams largely from the priority that the EU has given to the countries of eastern and central Europe which are preparing for future accession. The last enlargement, taking in Spain and Portugal, came as a big blow to Moroccan agriculture. Now the attention paid to central Europe has squeezed financial flows to Mediterranean partners. According to EU officials, per capita grants to central Europe are four times those to Morocco. The officials concede, however, that there are strong economic and social parallels between the two regions and the problems that arise on the EU's periphery. 'What you see on the Strait of Gibraltar and on the German-Polish border is strikingly similar: you have illegal trade, illegal migrants and drug traffic.' The future of the talks with the EU has now become linked to settlement of a fishing dispute. Morocco recently set out to halve a previously-agreed level of catches from its waters, claiming they had been overfished. Fishing is essentially a bilateral issue between Morocco and Spain, the country in the front line of Morocco's dealings with Europe. The relationship between the two is dynamic - especially in trade and investment - but also troublesome. The latest round of Euro-argument coincided with fresh stirrings by the Moroccan authorities over the Spanish enclaves on Morocco's northern shore, Ceuta and Melilla. Morocco is upset by Madrid's unwillingness to set up talks on the future of the territories, which have been in Spanish hands for more than 400 years, and especially by plans to give the two enclaves new statutes conferring a limited degree of self-rule. Agricultural problems also have to do primarily with competition with Spain. Morocco's difficulties have increased as a result of the Gatt agreement signed in Marrakesh in April. Moroccan producers of tomatoes, for instance, had invested heavily to supply the European market before minimum reference prices come into force in the spring. But under Gatt terms, the price mechanisms may be applied year-round, mainly to the benefit of the Moroccans' Spanish competitors. The issue is a vital one for Morocco, where 500,000 people are employed in the farm export sector, with up to 3m dependent on it for their livelihood. Moroccan negotiators now have the task of trying to reconcile the Gatt conditions with the country's present agreement with the EU. Instead of improved access, say officials in Rabat, Morocco now has to fight to safeguard what it already has. If the two issues of fishing and sensitive farm exports are resolved, the officials say, 'we can go ahead on a partnership, but it will fall far short of what we thought in 1992.' Ministers have spoken of a 'crisis of confidence' between Rabat and Brussels. However, it is foreseeable that under a revised negotiating mandate the EU may give ground on some of Morocco's requests, possibly including in the proposed agreement a provision for balance-of-payments support. Moroccan officials see both France and Spain as 'objective political allies' aware of the strategic and economic importance of developments in North Africa for the EU itself. 'But we find them in our way when it comes to sectorial or regional interests.' According to a EU official, 'our current difficulty with Morocco is that because of the economic recession in Europe we are pressed to take into account our short-term interests, which are often in contradiction with our long-term political and economic interests.' Last week the European Commission called on the EU to create a Euro-Mediterranean Economic Area with its North African and Middle East neighbours, thus establishing the world's biggest free trade area. As Mr Abdellatif Filali, the prime minister and foreign minister, said at a recent journalists' lunch: 'The Mediterranean is a lake. Morocco is not the other end of the world.'</p>

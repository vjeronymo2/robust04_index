			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Volvo tries to defuse revolt Volvo made a final push yesterday to defuse a shareholder revolt against its proposed merger with Renault by saying it had received new assurances from the French government on the most controversial aspects of the deal. It said France had confirmed it would not use its golden share against Volvo, providing the Swedish group did not try to lift its stake in the group to more than 35 per cent. This confirmation, aimed at removing fears of a dilution in Volvo's stake in the group, would be written into the agreement, it stated. Volvo added that a reaffirmation by Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, of a target date for the privatisation of Renault in the second half of next year, subject to market conditions, carried more weight than earlier assurances on the subject. Mr Balladur's comments, contained in a letter to his Swedish counterpart, Mr Carl Bildt, were published for the first time yesterday. Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, Volvo chairman, said: 'The Volvo board feels that two important questions have now been clarified.' He believed the assurances would be enough to persuade sceptical Swedish institutional shareholders to back the deal. Their hostility to the accord, centred on the golden share and the privatisation timetable, forced Volvo to delay a meeting to approve the deal until December 7. However, Aktiespararna, the small shareholders association which initiated the revolt, said the golden share provision still compromised the value of Volvo's shareholding in the merged company.</p>

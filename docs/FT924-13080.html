			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Westpac to sell TV network WESTPAC Banking Corporation, the troubled Australian bank, is planning to sell the Channel Ten television network to a consortium led by CanWest Global Communications, a Canadian broadcasting group. Westpac refused to reveal the sale price But Mr Frank Conroy, managing director, said it was 'commensurate' with the network's ADollars 245m (USDollars 175m) book value. Westpac took control of Channel Ten through a debt-for-equity swap last year. It was forced to do so after the receiver failed to find a buyer. The network had been in receivership since September 1990. CanWest, Canada's largest private TV broadcaster, has been associated with Westpac since last year, when it bought a majority stake in New Zealand's fledgling TV3 network.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Dagenham Motors recovers to Pounds 2.35m and seeks Pounds 9.9m Dagenham Motors, the south-east of England Ford dealer group, is raising Pounds 9.9m through a 2-for-5 rights issue, its first share issue since the company was floated in 1988. The group increased its pre-tax profits by 58 per cent to Pounds 2.35m (Pounds 1.48m) for the year to December 31 ending four years of decline. Before the recession profits peaked at Pounds 4m in 1988. The dividend is being raised to 6.25p per share (5.75p) with a recommended final of 4.5p. Earnings per share came out at 8.7p, compared with 5.6p. The company is issuing 6.77m new shares at 153p per share. The shares closed yesterday unchanged at 193p. The issue will be underwritten by Samuel Montagu. Mr David Philip, chairman and managing director, said that profits in the first two months of 1994 were substantially ahead of the corresponding period helped by the continuing strong recovery in the UK new vehicle market. New car sales rose by 19 per cent, used car sales by 27 per cent and new commercial vehicle sales by 32 per cent in the first two months. Group turnover for 1993 rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 187.3m (Pounds 155.9m). The figures were supported by an 11 per cent rise in new car sales to 8,580, a 10 per cent increase in used car sales to 6,896 and a 56 per cent jump in sales of new commercial vehicles. Dagenham Motors remains an exclusive Ford (cars and light commercial vehicles) and Iveco Ford (medium and heavy duty commercial vehicles) dealer group, but it is seeking to increase business in all-makes used car and after sales operations and in accident repair. Mr Philip said that the rights issue would help to reduce gearing from 125 per cent to 45 per cent and would give 'maximum flexibility in our pursuit of acquisition oppor-tunities'. It would also provide a sound base for 'the anticipated strong growth in the group's existing operations', which include seven Ford new car dealerships and two Iveco Ford commercial vehicle outlets in south-east England. The group was seeking additional Ford dealerships in or around the M25 circle, where it currently operated. By exercising outstanding options Mr Philip is raising his stake in the group from 8.3 to 9.1 per cent. The biggest outside shareholder is 3i with 12.8 per cent.</p>

			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Coup for Russia's arms salesdrive An agreement to be signed in Malaysia tomorrow for the purchase of 18 MiG-29 fighter aircraft is a success for Russia's drive to break into the most lucrative sectors of the international arms market. Malaysia will be the first country in the strongly anti-communist region to buy MiGs, but it cannot be accused of leaving itself dependent on Russian air power. It is also buying eight US-made F-18 fighters and 28 British Hawk fighters as part of a programme to upgrade the airforce. The country is using its new-found economic prosperity to modernise all its defence forces. Under the the current six-year (1991-95) defence plan, its is spending about Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) on weaponry, an increase of more than 200 per cent over the previous five years. That makes it exactly the kind of customer that Russia's newly revamped arms export agency is trying to woo. On the face of things, arms exports from the former Soviet Union plummeted following the collapse of communism, in part because so many of the country's traditional clients, such as Libya and Iraq, were subject to international sanctions. However the statistics were somewhat misleading. Most Soviet arms deliveries were dictated by political rather than commercial considerations, and they were often made on such soft terms as to be of little economic benefit to Moscow. Only now is the Russian government mounting a properly co-ordinated effort to sell weaponry to countries that can afford to pay. Russia's initial approaches to Malaysia were amateurishly presented - 'an offer scribbled on a piece of paper', as one military expert put it  - and governments in south-east Asia were bewildered by the number of Russians who claimed to have the authority to sell MiGs. Ironically, one of the Moscow's most high-profile salesmen in Malaysia has been Alexander Rutskoi, the renegade vice-president who was at the centre of last October's attempted putsch. Since the October violence, President Boris Yeltsin has moved to consolidate his own authority over the arms export business. He blessed the foundation in March, amid a dazzling display of corporate hospitality, of a new state agency called Ros-Vooruzhenie. As well as south-east Asia, other target markets include the wealthy Gulf states and Latin America. Russia sent a top-level delegation to an arms exhibition in Chile in March. The estimated value of the Malaysian deal is about Dollars 650m, with 25 per cent to be paid in palm oil. There have been tough negotiations over servicing and maintenance, with Malaysia pressing - reportedly with some success - for the production of some spare parts on its own soil. This is likely to raise eyebrows among western defence officials, who allege that the servicing of weaponry is often used as a cover for Russian military intelligence. However the Malaysian government is insisting a mixture serves its purposes best. It says its MiG fighters will be used for defence tasks, while the the F-18s will be deployed as strike aircraft. The combination will not be an unmixed blessing for the Malaysian air force, since it involves combining two systems for internal organisation and training. It could also complicate the efforts of south-east Asian countries to integrate their armed forces. However the country's refusal to commit itself to the weapon systems of any one major country has increased its financial bargaining power.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Boris Yeltsin has instructed the government to draw  up by 15 September a new taxation program that envisages a  reduction in the number of different taxes, a reduction in  privileges for enterprises involving foreign investment, a  reduction in VAT [value added tax] rates and in-profits tax, and  a reduction in deductions for social insurance funds from 5.4 to  3.4 percent of staff wages. Property tax for individuals, on the  other hand, should be increased substantially.</p>

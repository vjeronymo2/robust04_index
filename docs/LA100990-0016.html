			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SENIORS ALSO PART OF 'BOOK GENERATION'  </P> <P> In relation to your article on "The Book Generation" by Dennis McLellan (View,  Sept. 13), perhaps you would be interested in some readers at the other end of  the age spectrum.  </P> <P> A group of seniors meets on Fridays at 10 a.m. at the Golden Timers, 114 E.  19th St. in Costa Mesa, and new members are welcomed.  </P> <P> (Phone: (714) 642-2275.)  </P> <P> We read plays: classical or modern, serious or comic. The ability to act is not  at all essential, but if you're a seventy-something woman, you may read the  part of a 12-year-old boy with elan and understanding; and a sixty-something  man may read that of a faithless young wife in a very nice baritone for a few  pages.  </P> <P> The vintage of this group seems a good one. Our long life experience has  enriched our comprehension of some of its mysteries and humor -- if we do say  so ourselves. And we're still discovering wonders.  </P> <P> ESTHER B. SION  </P> <P> Costa Mesa  </P></p>

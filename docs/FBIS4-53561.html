			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 20 KYODO -- Transport Minister Nobuaki  Futami denied Friday [20 May] that transportation charges will  be raised sharply next January after the freeze on hikes in  public charges this year comes to an end.    "The ministry won't be adding anything extra onto the rises  that were withheld this year," Futami said, dismissing  speculation that expressway tolls and taxi fares could jump when  the freeze ends.    He said the hikes could be delayed from the planned Jan. 1  for political reasons, and that there could be another freeze if  the economy still looks bad at that time.    "A lifting of the freeze depends on an economic recovery. If  the situation looks serious, we will be giving the matter  further consideration," he said.    The minister expressed caution toward exempting the fares of  small regional taxi companies from the hike freeze this year.    "People could be put off from using taxis, (if such  companies  are allowed to raise their fares)," he said.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / VAT penalties may cost Pounds 100m CUSTOMS &amp; EXCISE is to pay up to Pounds 100m in penalties to payers of value added tax because of an error in drafting legislation seven years ago. The 1985 Finance Act allowed traders not receiving VAT refunds from Customs &amp; Excise within 30 days to claim an additional 5 per cent of the value of the refund as a penalty for the delay. The 1985 act was supposed to allow the 30-day period to be extended so that Customs &amp; Excise could check the accuracy or validity of claims where it had doubts. However, the High Court has ruled in the case Customs &amp; Excise vs L. Rowland (Retail) that the provisions in the 1985 act were more narrow than had been intended. The High Court said the original legislation only allowed the clock to be stopped for the time between raising queries with claimants and their responses, not for the entire period during which the payment claim was being investigated. New provisions in the most recent finance act this year have amended the legislation to give Customs &amp; Excise more breathing space. But the legislation is not retrospective, leaving the way open to demands for additional payments dating as far back as 1985. Those entitled to rebates will be any taxpayers claiming VAT where the money took more than 30 days to process, and where the sum they claimed was within 5 per cent of the final amount agreed with Customs &amp; Excise. For those with claims before 1988, their claim had to be within Pounds 100 of the settled amount. Last year Customs &amp; Excise paid out penalties of just Pounds 1.13m for legitimate refunds that took longer than 30 days to process. Total refunds from 2.5m claimants amounted to Pounds 23bn, of which fewer than two cases in 100 were queried for accuracy.

			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> TESTS TO DETERMINE FUEL POLLUTION LEVEL  </P> <P> Residents driving at night next week through the intersection of Newport Avenue  and Old Irvine Boulevard may notice some unusual activity as officials test for  contamination by jet fuel.  </P> <P> In June, officials discovered several leaks in a government-owned pipeline that  carries kerosene-based jet fuel from Norwalk to Marine Corps bases in El Toro  and Tustin.  </P> <P> The leaks, which had been suspected because pressure in the line had dropped,  were quickly found and repaired, Air Force Lt. Col. Pharris Johnson said.  </P> <P> But officials are not sure how long the fuel was leaking or how much seeped  into the ground, Johnson said.  </P> <P> The leaks in the pipe, which is six feet below ground, were apparently caused  by corrosion, he said.  </P> <P> Environmental tests revealed jet fuel in the soil; the round of tests scheduled  to begin next week will determine the extent.  </P> <P> Workers from Groundwater Technology Inc. in Torrance will drill seven holes --  each two inches wide and up to 120 feet deep -- to take soil samples, Johnson  said.  </P> <P> Bob Merryman, the county's environmental health director, said he is not aware  of a health or safety risk from the fuel.  </P> <P> "But they are doing a site assessment," he said, "and if the jet fuel got into  the ground water, then it could lead to a lengthy cleanup."  </P> <P> There has been no indication of contamination in ground water pumped in the  area, said Merryman, who added that ground water at that level is not used for  drinking water anyway.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / International Capital Markets: Malaysia agrees futures market MALAYSIA'S Ministry of Finance has given the go-ahead for the establishment of a Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Kloffe). A consortium of private firms will run the new exchange. Those involved are believed to have strong political connections. They are the New Straits Times newspaper group; Renong, an industrial conglomerate; and two securities firms, Rashid Hussain Bhd and Zalik Securities. The consortium had been involved in a tussle with the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) and the Kuala Lumpur Commodity Exchange (KLCE) for operation of the new exchange. The KLSE and KLCE were each offered a 20 per cent equity participation in Kloffe by its future operators, but both bodies declined.</p>

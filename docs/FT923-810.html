			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Arts: Farewell to David Mellor WHY ARE so many crocodile tears being shed over the departure of David Mellor, the erstwhile minister for the national heritage? While no one can defend the way in which he has apparently been hounded from office by gossip in the tabloid press, it is equally hard to find support for all the sudden praise that has appeared about his brief sojourn as a cabinet minister. Mellor knew before the election that he was going to be offered one of the most interesting new ministries in the Major government. On a plate he was given the chance to re-define government attitudes to the arts and heritage. At the most fundamental level, because of his previous experience as chief secretary at the Treasury, he knew how the rules were applied when it came to public spending. He could have achieved the impossible and changed the way the Treasury funded the arts. There is no evidence that he was beginning to do this. At a meeting of a prominent arts organisation which was in progress when Mellor's resignation was announced, a loud cheer went up. Why? Because they had suffered for too long from a minister who had completely failed to impress on any level as an arts and heritage minister. He appeared to many to be a man who relied on a unique combination of arrogance and ignorance. Since the election he had failed to weld together his civil servants into a coherent department. He even failed to make a decision about where his ministry should be located. It was always difficult to get clear answers from his office and he had a reputation for nearly always being late or failing to arrive at meetings. His office has no records of his speeches - they were, we were told, delivered off the cuff. Certainly the major speech he made at the Royal Academy Dinner this year was one of the worst speeches that I have ever heard about the visual arts. It was worse than bad because in tone and content it showed contempt for the audience of distinguished artists and curators. So what did David Mellor achieve as a minister? The answer is nothing. He was offered remarkable opportunities. Take the European Arts Festival, which had full Government backing: could anyone say that it had any serious impact? Mellor had every card in his hand but his activities remained partial and compromised. It is hard to find convincing evidence that he established his new ministry on the cultural map in any objective way. His successor will have to start from scratch and remove the unpleasant stain of self-absorption and arrogance that lingers over his empty office.</p>

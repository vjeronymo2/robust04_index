			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German uncertainty casts shadow on bourses POLITICAL and industrial uncertainty in Germany cast a shadow on continental trading. Zurich was closed for a holiday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT took the start of the public service workers' strike in western Germany and the sudden resignations in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet in its stride. The DAX index closed down 3.48 at 1,742.22 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, shed 2.35 to 708.46. Turnover fell to DM4.4bn from DM5bn. Some analysts said that the market's reaction to the strike had been positive so far since the government had demonstrated that it was not prepared to concede to union pressure over pay claims. However, a prolonged strike would erode share prices, they said. Chemicals stood out in a dull day for corporate news. Bayer gained DM1.90 to DM289 ahead of its dividend payout later this week while Hoechst fell DM1.20 to DM262.30. Basf was 40 pfg lower at DM249.90. Siemens rose 90 pfg to DM687.90. After the close it announced an 8 per cent increase in six-month net profit. Berliner Bank closed DM2.50 higher at DM269.50 after announcing a 23 per cent rise in 1991 net profit. The three major banks were weaker, with Deutsche Bank down DM2.50 to DM713. Elsewhere, Horten, which said that it was to increase its 1991 dividend by DM1 to DM5, shed 70 pfg to DM180. PARIS came close to breaking above the elusive 2,000 barrier on the CAC-40 index in late trading, spurred by a recovery in bond prices and a strong franc. The CAC-40 index ended 10.81 higher at 1,995.72, just below the day's high of 1,998.45 and well up on the day's low of 1,973.39. Turnover was thin at FFr1.8bn. Michelin ran into profit-taking after last week's gains, losing FFr3.70 to FFr204.70 in heavy volume of 450,450 shares. But Peugeot continued its advance, buoyed up by news that it planned to increase its dividend payout in coming years. The stock added FFr12 to FFr770. Eurotunnel remained weak, losing FFr1.35 or 3.6 per cent to FFr35.65 with a heavy 2.3m shares traded. The tube maker Vallourec lost another FFr13 to FFr223 after a negative analysts' meeting last Friday. Moulinex had a volatile day, falling as low as FFr162.50 after the company turned less positive on 1992, but ended just FFr1 lower at FFr172 with 70,800 shares traded. MILAN closed unchanged, as continued strength in the car sector offset weaker prices elsewhere. News that President Francesco Cossiga had resigned had little impact on the market. The Comit index fell 0.43 to 508.43 in turnover estimated at less than Friday's L91.1bn. Pirelli, actively traded last week, gave the first boost to the market, gaining L40 to L1,405. But some analysts said it was time to take profits on the stock. Fiat closed L8 higher at L4,985. But Stet continued last week's decline, closing L20 down at L2,100 and Sip lost L5.5 to L1,452.5. Benetton fell L350 to L13,600. STOCKHOLM weakened at the start on interest rate worries but steady gains by Astra, Ericsson and Electrolux helped reverse the trend. The Affarsvarlden general index eased 0.2 to 987.1 in heavy turnover of SKr784m after SKr586m, bloated by an off-market SKr365m block trade in Electrolux shares at SKr260 each, amounting to just under 2 per cent of the company's equity. The B shares closed at SKr262, up SKr3. Volvo B shares rose SKr6 to a new year's high of SKr446 ahead of the annual meeting tomorrow. BRUSSELS saw its recent favourite Delhaize fall BFr330 or 3.6 per cent to BFr9,360 with more than 15,570 shares traded following worse-than-expected results from its US division. The Bel-20 index dropped 11.20 to 1,210.38 in turnover of BFr700m. Petrofina lost BFr50 to BFr10,850 after news that its US division had recorded a first quarter loss. AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index lost 0.7 to 127.9 in turnover of Fl 437.1m. Begemann rose Fl 8.00 or 7.5 per cent to Fl 113.50 on strong retail buying. This followed a newspaper interview with the chairman at the weekend in which he said that the group's market value was too low. ING, which reports 1991 earnings today, was 50 cents down at Fl 50.30. Nedlloyd declined 90 cents to Fl 57.40 after Mr Torstein Hagen, a major shareholder, confirmed that he has an option on a further 5 per cent of the stock. MADRID fell in dull trade. The general index shed 0.1 to 249.93 in turnover of some Pta8.4bn. Repsol gained Pta5 to Pta2,840 on expectations of good first quarter results, due early next month. OSLO's all-share index gained 1.38 to 427.33 in turnover of NKr280m. Norsk Hydro, due to announce first quarter results tomorrow, advanced NKr1.5 to NKr161. ISTANBUL fell following a number of disappointing first quarter results. The index was down 95.8 or 2.6 per cent at 3,717.88.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - APR 27  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open    10 am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1164.76  1166.13  1167.31  1167.47  1168.43  1170.13  1169.98  1169.59  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                  Day's High  1170.33    Day's Low  1164.72  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Apr 24    Apr 23    Apr 22    Apr 21    Apr 16 1167.02   1169.11   1171.34   1166.73   1169.83  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

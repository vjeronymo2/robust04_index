			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / Markets: Japanese trust launch - At a glance Edinburgh Fund Managers is launching a Japanese investment trust which aims to raise between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m. It is the first new Japanese investment trust launch for ten years. EFM Japan will come to the market via an institutional placing and offer to intermediaries. It will not be a complex split-capital issue but has a conventional structure - there will only be ordinary shares, plus warrants issued on a one-for-five basis. Iain Watt, EFM managing director, said he was confident that the trust would not move to a discount to net asset value. The ordinary shares of 25p will be issued at 100p while the warrants will be exercisable from 1993 to 2005 at that price. The trust is open for subscription between June 15-June 23.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / US markets tense over interest rates US stock and bond markets held their ground in nervous trading yesterday as investors waited to see if the Federal Reserve's open market committee (FOMC), which began a two-day meeting in the afternoon, would vote to raise interest rates. The recent decline in the value of the dollar had convinced some analysts on Wall Street that the Fed governors and regional presidents who make up the FOMC would decide that it required the support of higher interest rates. But as market sentiment shifted towards the view that central bank support of the US currency was unlikely, the dollar yesterday lost more than pfennig during London trading. It closed in London at DM1.5826 against DM1.5965 on Monday, while in New York it was trading at DM1.5835 at lunchtime. Against the yen, the dollar dipped to Y98.825 in London, against Y98.9 on Monday, and was quoted at Y98.87 in New York midsession trading. Higher interest rates could divert international money flows into dollar-based financial assets such as US government bonds. Although sentiment towards the dollar remains firmly negative, analysts said the market was wary of selling the currency aggressively for fear of being caught out by concerted central bank intervention. Meanwhile, US stock and bond prices spent the morning moving within a narrow trading range, as many investors and traders chose to sit on the sidelines until the FOMC meeting was over. By 1pm, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 12.63 at 3,659.28, but broader indices were either flat or lower. Treasury market prices also barely moved, with the yield on the 30-year benchmark bond holding steady at 7.6 per cent. Although all eyes were on the FOMC yesterday, not everyone on Wall Street was convinced that the committee would decide whether or not to raise rates. Some analysts believed the Fed would not review its monetary policy stance until it had seen the latest employment figures. The next employment report, for June, is due to be released on Friday.

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Volvo recovers on surge in sales: Truck and car operations spearhead group recovery Volvo, Sweden's biggest manu-facturer, yesterday reported a 12-fold leap in profits in the first nine months of the year. Surging sales for its cars and trucks and big capital gains consolidated the company's dramatic recovery from recession. Pre-tax profits reached SKr12.7bn (Pounds 1.3bn), compared with SKr1.06bn in the same period last year, as sales rose to SKr112.2bn from SKr73.5bn. The result was boosted by the inclusion of BCP, the food and drinks group now fully-owned by Volvo, which added SKr15.2bn to group sales and SKr1.6bn to group operating profits of SKr6.6bn. The bottom line was also inflated by SKr4.2bn earned by the sale during the period of non-core assets, in line with Volvo's strategy of concentrating on motor vehicle production following the breakdown last year of a plan to merge with Renault of France. But both the car and truck divisions continued a significant recovery under way throughout this year, driven by growing demand in their main US and European markets. Volvo managed to bring its new flagship 850 car model and FH truck series on to the market just as recession in its main markets was coming to an end. Unit car sales rose 18 per cent to 269,600, pushing up the value of sales to SKr52.8bn from SKr39.8bn and producing a leap in operating profits to SKr1.95bn, from SKr10m. Truck sales, benefiting from a recovery in demand in all main markets except Germany, grew faster, with worldwide unit sales rising to 49,400, a jump of 38 per cent over the same period last year. Sales totalled SKr37.3bn, compared with SKr27bn, while operating profits rose to SKr2.7bn from SKr183m. However, Mr Soren Gyll, chief executive, struck a warning note. 'While the improvement in earnings in our core operations is gratifying, it is not yet adequate,' he said. He expressed satisfaction with the truck performance, saying the operating margin stood at 7 per cent. But he warned that the car division, with an operating margin of 4 per cent, had been held back by higher costs caused by a change in production and foreign exchange hedging which restricted the benefits from the devaluation last year of the Swedish krona. 'A doubling (of car division profits) is required. An operating margin of 7 per cent is judged to be adequate for continued expansion,' Mr Gyll said. He also said that the strong demand for trucks and cars had led to delays in deliveries of as much as six months as Volvo hit capacity ceilings. 'We are working hard to correct this problem,' he said. Volvo is investing SKr390m to raise truck capacity to 50,000 a year outside the US by next July. Background, Page 33</p>

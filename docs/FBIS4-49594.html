			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 7 (XINHUA) -- A recent opinion poll  shows that most Chinese urban residents are satisfied with the  country's current political, economic and cultural conditions.    The results of the opinion poll, which were released here  today, also show that most city people agree that "building a  socialist market economy has brought benefits to the Chinese  people".    The poll was conducted by the research institute of public  opinion of Beijing's People's University last December among  1,200 families in Qingdao, a coastal city in east China's  Shandong Province.    Among the 2,795 people who answered the questionnaires, 75  percent said that their diet had "improved" or "improved  obviously"; 71 percent said their clothing and daily necessities  had improved.    Some 89.9 percent said they were "satisfied" or "rather  satisfied" with market supplies; 60.9 percent said the same  thing about their recreational life; 61 percent were happy with  middle and primary school education; 50.5 percent were pleased  with the public health situation; and 76.5 percent were  satisfied with the state of power and water supplies.    About the current political, economic and cultural  conditions, 84.2 percent agreed that "the socialist market  economy has instilled vitality into society and brought benefits  to the people".    Some 86.4 percent said they were "full of confidence about  the country's reform and opening to the outside world".    The poll also indicates that many urban residents are not  satisfied with housing, prices, services, product quality and  urban transportation.    A total of 51.2 percent said they were "dissatisfied" or  "rather dissatisfied" with their housing conditions; 62.4  percent said the same about the current level of prices; 64.4  percent were not satisfied with product quality; 51.4 percent  expressed dissatisfaction with services; and 55.3 percent were  unhappy with urban transportation.    The people who answered the questionnaires included Army  officers, retired people, factory workers, private businessmen,  government officials, university and middle school students and  housewives.    Looking ahead to the next five years, 71.7 percent said that  they were "optimistic" or "rather optimistic" about the  improvement of their diet; 47.8 percent were "optimistic" or  "rather optimistic" about improvements in housing.    The poll also shows that 61.6 percent of Chinese people have  become tolerant about the widening gap between the poor and the  rich.    Some 69.7 percent said that they no longer have to behave  "very carefully" when they want to change their way of life.</p>

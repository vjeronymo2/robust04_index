			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] AWB [Afrikaner Resistance Movement] leader Eugene  Terreblanche has made renewed threats of war. He told a public  meeting in Bloemfontein last night that although the AWB wanted  peace, if the right wing went to war it would not be for 14  percent of the country but for the whole country.    [Begin recording] [Correspondent Conrad Burke] Addressing a  crowd of more than 2,000 supporters in the city hall, Mr.  Terreblanche said he had 60,000 trained soldiers in  Bloemfontein. He added that 95 percent of the commandos in the  [Orange] Free State were also right wingers. Mr. Terreblanche  warned that if there was war, it would be full scale.    [Terreblanche in Afrikaans] If you want peace, give the  Boers  their state. If you do not give it to us, I tell you, there is  no force on earth which will hold back the Boer nation from  taking back its fatherland through violence.    [Burke] After all the Afrikaner people had done in the  development of the country, said Mr. Terreblanche, a patch of  land to plow seemed little to ask for. The AWB leader added  that loyal sections of the Defense Force and the police would  stand behind the Afrikaner people in their fight for freedom.    [Terreblanche] I have the biggest assurance, and I want to  say very positively that the South African Defense Force and the  South African Police, if commanded by the communist to shoot  their people, will not do it because they know where their  loyalty, their God, their church, and their people are. [end  recording]    Mr. Terreblanche told GMSA [Good Morning South Africa] a  while ago that he was unaware of the government and ANC [African  National Congress] concessions when he made his speech last  night. He said that like the other members of the Freedom  Alliance, the AWB would study these concessions before  commenting on them.</p>

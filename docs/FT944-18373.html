			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: No need for this ignorance of European institutions Sir, It was ironic that Robert Rice should refer ('Cost of Ignorance', September 30) to the regular confusion between the European Community's Court of Justice and the Council of Europe's Court of Human Rights, when the previous day your front page article, 'Pensions ruling will put costs on employers', referred to the decision of the former, as '. . . part of a series of judgments in Strasbourg . . .' The institutions of the European Community are highly active and there is an enormous amount of information available about those activities. There is no reason for confusion or that any of them should be 'shadowy' bodies. News coverage, however, can often be poor, even from the most reliable of sources. Robert Rice was writing about the recent human rights reference, arising out of the Guinness affair. Various reports about that, on TV and in the newspapers, wrongly attributed it to the EU, the EC and the European Court of Justice. On the day, recently, that the proposed paternity-leave legislation was under discussion in Brussels, a radio news report conjectured that if a compromise could not be agreed with the UK, then under the Social Chapter, the other 11 states, might go it alone] Robert Rice is correct about the European Court of Justice. It and the other Community institutions do enjoy considerable 'power . . . over business' as well as other aspects of our lives. But as long as significant media comment directs our attention to matters such as the European Commission's interference, with our inalienable right to regulate for ourselves, the size and shape of our courgettes and bananas, I fear that we shall continue to pay the 'cost of ignorance'.

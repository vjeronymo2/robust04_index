			<p>BFN     [Text] QUDS PRESS--A senior official of the Palestinian  organization Hamas, which opposes peace negotiations with  Israel, has said that Libya has promised the Alliance of  Palestinian Forces [APF] financial and political aid for the  liberation of Palestine.    Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for Hamas, the biggest  faction within the APF, said that a delegation of all the  leaders from the opposition factions recently returned from an  official visit to the Libyan capital Tripoli. He added that  this is the first visit of its kind.    In a statement to QUDS PRESS, Ghawshah said that the leaders  of the alliance visited Libya at the invitation of Libyan  President Mu'ammar Qadhdhafi. He noted that the delegation  included George Habash, secretary general of the Popular Front  for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP]; Colonel Muhammad Musa,  alias Abu-Musa, secretary of the central committee of the  Palestine National Liberation Movement, Fatah-The Uprising; Dr.  Fathi al-Shaqaqi, leader of the Islamic Jihad Movement; Talal  Naji, assistant secretary general of the PFLP-General Command;  'Arabi 'Awwad, secretary general of the Revolutionary Communist  Party; Nayif Hawatimah, secretary general of the Democratic  Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP]; 'Isam al-Qadi  [secretary general of the Popular Liberation War Vanguards  Organization-Al-Sa'iqah]; Abu-Nidal al-Ashqar [member of the  Palestine Liberation Front Political Bureau]; Khalid  'Abd-al-Majid [secretary general of the splinter group  Palestinian Popular Struggle Front]; in addition to Ghawshah  himself and Khalid Mash'al from Hamas.    The spokesman said that the delegation held a two-hour  meeting with leader Qadhdhafi in Surt. The delegation demanded  that Qadhdhafi support the intifadah and the mujahidin and work  on stopping attempts of normalization with the Zionist enemy, as  he said he would. The Palestinian official said that last  Saturday, the delegation met with Colonel Abu-Bakr Yunus, the  Libyan Chief of Staff and member of the ruling Revolution  Command Council.    Ghawshah described the visit as useful and fruitful. He  said: It is a gain in itself to exchange views and agree on  common denominators dealing with Arab and official interests.  He noted that Libya promised to offer more moral and financial  support for the liberation of Palestine. He added that he  expects the APF leadership to visit Iran on a date that has not  yet been fixed.</p>

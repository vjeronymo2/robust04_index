			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Peace deal breakthrough with Syria on the cards EGYPT believes an outline peace agreement between Israel and Syria is achievable by the end of this year. President Hosni Mubarak, Mr Amr Moussa, foreign minister, and Dr Osama el Baz, the president's top political adviser, have been encouraged by recent meetings with Syrian and Israel leaders and now hope their unofficial date for a breakthrough can be met. Mr Moussa said in an interview with the Financial Times that the progress in the negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation meant the issues separating Israel and Syria could be addressed with more urgency. 'We are making progress although I would not yet say that a deal is close. We have set a target date for the end of this year for the signing of a document on which both sides can agree,' Mr Moussa said. He rejected the contention by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel that more time was needed for Israeli public opinion to take in the contents of the deal with the PLO. 'We believe a good deal between Israel and Syria could be absorbed and would be digestible. Our task is to get a good deal acceptable to public opinion on both sides. We are talking about a matter of months before all tracks are on the road to agreement.' He stressed it was critical for Israel and the PLO to meet the December 13 target date for the start of an Israeli troop withdrawal from the Gaza strip and the West Bank town of Jericho; he believed they would meet the deadline. Mr Moussa, who helped broker the resumption of these talks in Cairo last week, said they are now proceeding 'in a fine way, in a good way'. The PLO-Israeli discussions continue in the Egyptian town of Taba on Monday. The essence of an Israeli-Syria deal was clear. 'It has to be a full and total Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights and a full peace.' The Israeli withdrawal could be phased, but 'the phasing should be reasonable; we can't talk about five years or so, it must be a matter of months.'</p>

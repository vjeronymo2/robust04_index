			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Number of cable phone subscribers trebles The number of cable telephone subscribers almost trebled last year, and heavy investment in new construction is likely to see subscriber numbers more than double in 1994. Cable exchange line connections rose last year from 109,133 to 317,000. Residential customers accounted for most of the growth, with the number of business lines rising from 16,000 to about 35,000. The Cable Television Association predicts that total exchange line connections will rise to more than 700,000 this year. It expects growth again to be led by the residential sector, where cable companies are competing with British Telecommunications mainly on price. Growth is faster than predicted when the BT/Mercury duopoly was abolished in 1991, allowing cable companies - mostly north American telecommunications operators - to build combined television and telephone networks in urban areas. Virtually all growth has been concentrated in the past 18 months; in July 1992 there were only 48,000 cable telephone subscribers. In some areas under construction, take-up of cable telephony is already running at around 30 per cent, with telephony more popular than cable television. The cable companies market the two together, often with discounts for customers taking both. With more than 20m lines, BT's dominance is not immediately threatened. But with Mercury also marketing its long-distance network to residents for the first time, cable operators are set to make a significant dent in BT's armoury. The cable companies have invested about Pounds 1.7bn in their new networks, and the investment will increase to more than Pounds 5bn over the next four years. Mr Alan Bates, managing director of Jones Cable, a US operator with a share in nine UK franchises, forecast 'five or six' large equity financing deals within the next few months, each of which would raise more than Pounds 100m for future expansion. Most of the top 10 UK cable operators would be involved, he said. Jones led the way last year with a Pounds 152m equity-and-debt deal to fund construction in Leeds. Investors included NatWest Ventures and Cable &amp; Wireless, which owns Mercury. Combined cable television and telephone networks are under construction in 62 franchises, covering a total of 15m homes. BT has only one franchise, for Westminster, where it is constructing a cable TV network. Videotron, an operator with six London franchises, has applied to the government for a licence to build a telephone network in the same area. With Colt, another US-owned company, building its own network in the City, central London could have three rival local phone networks if Videotron gains its licence.</p>

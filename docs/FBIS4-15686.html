			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, Apr 08, BNS -- The Lithuanian parliament  on Thursday [7 April] adopted a law on excises and passed  several amendments to the value-added tax law. Both laws come  into effect May 1.    The size of excises will be determined by the government.  According to the new law, excises will be imposed on beer,  chocolate, cocoa, liquors, tobacco, jewelry, gasoline, diesel  fuel, luxury cars, as well as publication of erotic or violent  nature. Excises will not be applied to coffee and electric  energy.    Finance Minister Eduardas Vilkelis told Lithuanian TV that  the excises law should not strongly affect prices, although some  goods may become more expensive.    The value-added tax will replace the currently existing  18-percent general excise tax. The new tax rate is also 18  percent. The value-added tax will be imposed on all import,  including energy.    The amendments adopted Thursday create slightly more  favorable conditions for local producers. Payment of the tax  may be put off to enterprises that import much material  resources. The parliament also extended the term of paying the  tax.    According to various estimations, the value-added tax will  increase prices by an average of 8 to 10 percent. But Vilkelis  said a package of documents on compensations for the price-leap  will soon follow. The minister said the government intends to  raise pensions and budget salaries by no less than 10 percent  May 1.</p>

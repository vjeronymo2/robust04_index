			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Armenia introduces own currency Armenia, which has devoted much of its wealth to fighting a war with Azerbaijan, today introduces its own currency, the dram, after much hesitation in abandoning the rouble, writes Leyla Boulton from Moscow. Moldova, another former Soviet republic involved in ethnic strife, plans to introduce its own currency on November 29. This leaves only Belarus, which is negotiating full monetary and economic union with Moscow, and Tajikistan, sharing the rouble with Russia. Meanwhile, Lithuania, one of the first republics to leave the Russian economic orbit, has concluded a trade pact with Russia to restore trading links built up during five decades of Soviet rule.</p>

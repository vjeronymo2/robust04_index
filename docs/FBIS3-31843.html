			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Rebroadcast of Sarajevo TV interview and phone-in program </F> with Alija Izetbegovic, president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency, by unidentified announcer in Sarajevo on 22 February  -- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Let us begin with what interests our  viewers and listeners the most -- yesterday [21 February], the  expiry of the NATO ultimatum, and everything that happened. You  declared last night that our spring was at hand, that the  withdrawal of Serb heavy artillery was a victory for us, but  that it was not complete and flawless.    [Izetbegovic] Yes. Some had commented that my statement was  overly optimistic, and, indeed, it was pronouncedly optimistic  intentionally. All day long I was listening to people moaning  about how all this was not good. I could not understand why. I  am afraid we are becoming slightly inclined to fall for enemy  propaganda. The Serbs tried to convince their own people that  this absolute moral, military, and political defeat was in fact  a victory for them, and they tried to convince us as well. I  heard certain defeatist statements to that effect, so I wanted  to counter it by making a slightly overly optimistic statement.    However, it is a fact, in my opinion, that it was a moral,  military, and political defeat. Why? Moral because they  withdrew. That is undeniable. One must pack up and go -- it a  moral fiasco. Political because the dreams they had been  dreaming for two years on those hills about conquering the city  were finally jettisoned. They were certainly not up there for  the fun of it. Although their initial and main objective was to  diminish our numbers by striking at the civilian population,  their paramount objective was to conquer the city. They were  compelled to give that up and leave. Militarily? Because they  left most of the weapons behind.    [Announcer] We saw all they had withdrawn -- all those  tanks,  cannons, howitzers, mortar launchers. In the long run, it must  be said that this was their defeat. If they could keep us  encircled with all those weapons without accomplishing anything  except for killing civilians....    [Izetbegovic, interrupting] I am not sure anyone noticed  that  it has become clear only now what we had to put up with for  almost two years. The world has been taken aback by the sheer  might of all that iron, the tanks that remained here, and those  armored personnel carriers, those barrels that remained, and  those that were withdrawn -- all that has been registered by  television cameras belonging to foreign TV networks. Those  columns of vehicles. All those things were overlooking the  city. We managed to get rid of all that, we liberated ourselves  from that, and we certainly have to consider that as our  victory. And another thing. Our people say: He who punches  strongly is not the tough one, but he who endures the punch. We  have endured those punches.    [Announcer] UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] units have been  deployed along the separation lines, although it remains to be  seen whether they will stay there. How do you view the future  of Sarajevo in the light of the proposals for it to become a UN-  administered city?    [Izetbegovic] The immediate future of Sarajevo is UN  administration. Of course, it is a temporary solution which  will last for less than two years. Not longer than two years,  maybe up to two years. It is a period in which it will be  possible to salvage what we have always wished to do to have an  undivided city.    We think that first at the beginning.... [pauses] Naturally  after.... [pauses] The first was by all means necessary, the  first condition above all other conditions was to stop shooting,  to stop the immediate killing in the city, although I must say  straight away, perhaps it is partially a reply to the question  put a while ago, we cannot think that there will be no killing  here and there. Their infantry is still there. Of course, we  are going to resist that infantry much more successfully than  before. If you can remember the city was full of snipers in the  first couple of months of the spring 1992; we have managed to  mop up all those, we have silenced them all. We are probably  going to silence them gradually, even more so because now that  their artillery has been withdrawn. Without their artillery  they are nothing. They are used to having a heavy gun next to  them. When the gun is gone, they are going to be something  completely different. But still, here and there they are going  to snatch a victim or two. Therefore, people should be wary of  that. That is past.    However, we are now trying.... [pauses] The next step would  be gradually to restore communications. Let people meet, let  them see each other, let them go; we shall see whether it is  possible to achieve that thing, that our people go to Serb-held  Grbavica, let people from Grbavica come here. People are  something different from their soldiery that was deployed there.    [Announcer] And criminals who were there?    [Izetbegovic] They are not going to be able to come here.  But ordinary people who suffered in Grbavica as much as we  suffered here, who shared our suffering and hardships, maybe we  shall understand when we have a look at each other that we are  not monsters. I think that communication is the next step,  after that a bit of trade will come. Before that, normalization  in water and electricity supply. Somewhat better food supplies,  better and more regular humanitarian aid. That would be a path  to preserve the city as a whole. One day a question will  probably be asked on what Sarajevans want from Sarajevo. And  that is the real question. See, we have all been discussing the  issue of Sarajevo. The question is how much we are authorized  to resolve the Sarajevo issue. Sarajevo has to be resolved by  the Sarajevans. And most probably one day we shall demand a  referendum.    Sarajevo has to be resolved by the people of Sarajevo and,  most likely, one day we shall ask them whether they want a  divided or undivided Sarajevo and let it be the way the people  want it. I have almost no doubt at all that the people will say  they want to live together in the city. How would the people  from Grbavica [words indistinct].    Where will people ask for medical help? You can see that the  city cannot be divided The city is an organic entity, and I  have no doubt that, if asked how they want to live, the city  will be opened.    [Announcer] [Question indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] [words indistinct] I must be honest and say  that nobody ever said that any new UNPA [UN protection area]  zones should be created here -- the UNPA zones in Croatia have  proven to be a bad solution. Something like that has not been  on offer here.    Here we accept only patrols and control points, not even the  demarcaton lines, or control points, but lines. I think such a  possibility does not exist.    [Announcer] Mentioning that, those people on Pale and  Trebevic have celebrated this as a great victory. They have  after all got what they have always wanted -- the Russians.    [Izetbegovic] Let me say, as we are talking about the  Russians. I sent a letter today to UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali asking him what happened to the Pakistani soldiers  whose arrival was expected six months ago. Then it was delayed  until September, then till November, etc. They have not arrived  -- ostensibly the problem was how to equip 3,000 people, for  they were soldiers without any equipment. It cannot be possible  that the West cannot provide equipment for 3,000 people to come  here. Obviously this is a case of some other kind of games.    I demanded his reply to this question. After I had talked  this morning with Turkish Foreign Minister Cetin -- who, as you  know, has offered 10,000 people to come here, which is really  too many -- I also demanded in the letter that 2,000 or 3,000  Turkish soldiers be sent here.    As to the arrival of the Russians. They did not come because  of the Serbs. Anyone who understands anything about politics  knows very well that this is in fact.... [pauses] You know that  their arrival was supported by the Americans. The question  arises: why did they support it? They gave it their support,  most importantly, to help Yeltsin at a very difficult time in  Russia. Since Yeltsin began to make some more radical moves in  Russia, he has managed to shut up whatsis name.    [Announcer] Zhirinovskiy?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, Zhirinovskiy. He has shut him up a bit.  I believe that in such a situation the Americans and the West  wanted to strengthen Yeltsin's position. I think that was a  good move. They succeeded in strengthening his position. The  tide there had to be stopped, the nationalist tide in Russia,  which does not suit us or the West either, the nationalist  tide, and its derivative, Nazism. A strong wave of Nazism is  being felt in Russia and is reaching Europe as well. I believe  that in this way they have managed to suppress it a little, in  the general interest of the free world.    I therefore think that the arrival of the Russians was not  motivated by the desire to simply help the Serbs. It helped  Yeltsin.    [Announcer] As we are speaking about the Russians, we have  had an opportunity to see pictures shot by foreign TV companies.  We have seen the kissing, hugging, and even the three-finger  salutes [Serbian] through the little window of the Russian  armored vehicles, where a gun should normally be positioned. We  have seen them giving away cigarettes and even exchanging hats.  Generals exchanging hats!    [Izetbegovic] Yes, and I have been told that today, as they  were passing by the Bosnian Presidency building they did  approximately the same thing. I held talks last night with  Sergio di Mello and General Rose, and we drew their attention to  the Russian behavior. They apologized for that, for these  Russians are, after all, UN soldiers. They said they would talk  to the Russians and warn them strictly about their behavior. We  said that the Russians would get correct treatment in exchange  for correct behavior.    [Announcer] We shall see now what was happening. For this  program we have selected a video for our viewers to see once  again, although majority of them have already seen, but as  electricity supply was restored we have received requests from  Tuzla, Zenica, and other areas, Kakanj, Sarajevo, to repeat this  video. Here is officer asking where your people are and so on  and so on. Let us recall once again in brief what and how  [words indistinct] those that arrived in Grbavica to keep peace,  here you can see the infamous three-finger salute from an  armored personnel carrier. Can we trust them in their  supervision of that heavy weaponry?    [Izetbegovic] We can trust them as much as we can trust  UNPROFOR. We can trust them [word indistinct] with some  reserve. They are UNPROFOR soldiers, and I hold that....  [pauses] There are between 12,000 and 13,000 UNPROFOR soldiers  in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The number of 400 Russians represents a  couple of percent.    [Announcer] Have there been discussions about a higher  number?    [Izetbegovic] There have been discussions, but I think that  it will not happen, but we shall demand some other troops to be  deployed here parallel to them. As I said earlier we have  called....    [Announcer, interrupting] Here you can see these pictures.    [Izetbegovic] We have called others, if the Russians can  come, the Turks can also come.    [Announcer] And other [word indistinct], of course. Today we  received an interesting report. On the border between Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Serbs have blocked an UNPROFOR unit.  Several tanks are also mentioned in the report, and the news  speaks about calls for NATO air force to act but only by  carrying out overflights. Will the Sarajevo issue trigger off  NATO actions in this area. And here we have another question  from Sarajevo: will there be air strikes against Serb positions  or is that story nearly finished?    [Izetbegovic] I think that at least we can say one thing for  sure: air strikes have not been ruled out. Their likelihood has  considerably decreased since the evening when Chetniks accepted  to hand in their weapons, to withdraw or to abandon them. They  simply abandoned some of their weapons, being unable to withdraw  them and being unwilling to die sitting next to those weapons.  They simply abandoned them and informed UNPROFOR that they had  left them in the snow up there.    People who were overflying Sarajevo could see many pieces of  abandoned weaponry, abandoned heavy guns. Since then the  likelihood has decreased because it was important for UNPROFOR  whether Chetniks would shoot. As they were claiming they would  not shoot, UNPROFOR informed their relevant commands up there,  and they postponed it.    It would be best to say that this is something that has been  postponed. In case they shoot on the city, no matter where  from, either from within the 20-km radius, or outside this  radius, or if they attack UN troops anywhere else, air strikes  will probably be applied. I think that in this respect, this is  my impression, there will be no hesitating.    Of course, they are trying to avoid that. Let us make it  clear, they were very happy not to carry out attacks. They were  not enthusiastic about carrying out attacks. As you know there  was a trick with a report that was launched at the last hour  saying that the infamous shell was fired from our positions.  That was an attempt to somehow avoid a decision to carry out  air strikes. What is strange is that a good part of the  international press and some responsible people accepted it as  something that had to be seriously examined. They would be very  happy if something like that could be proven to avoid air  strikes. Then they would not have to intervene, and so on and  so on. Simply they are not enthusiastic about doing that, but I  think that in case of flagrant violation of the agreements and  conditions of the declaration, in case the city comes under  shelling, if UN troops are attacked, I do not doubt that air  strikes against attackers would take place.    [Announcer] Do you believe NATO forces will react somewhere  else if UNPROFOR does not?    [Izetbegovic] That could happen in two instances: in case  Sarajevo was bombarded and attacked and in case UNPROFOR units  were attacked. In these two cases they would.... [pauses] It  would all depend on the intensity of the attack, whether the  troops were in danger. In case they were attacked and suffered  casualties, there is no doubt they would retaliate.    [Announcer] Let us return to the shell. A viewer is asking:  They formed a commission to find out who fired the shell at  Markale on 5 February. What can you say about that, let us link  your reply to what was said on French television's Channel Five.    [Izetbegovic] Yes. I recently replied to that question. You  see, it was a little cynical. People ask themselves where a  shell came from. What about the other 300,000 shells? Who  slaughtered 1,300 children, who maimed 10,000 children, who  wiped out so many thousands of Sarajevans, who destroyed  everything in Sarajevo, the city hall.... [pauses] Who fired  hundreds of shells at the military hospital? This person is  asking about this one shell?! Finally, it would be very  difficult today to technically establish who fired the shell, no  one can say for sure. That is all that can be said at the  moment.    Therefore, they wished to say this: well, as it is known  that it would be technically impossible to establish who fired  the shell -- it cannot be established -- then the air strikes  cannot be carried out. Approximately that line of reasoning.  Thank God, it did not go down well this time; people could not  be fooled this time. What I told you a minute ago is very  interesting. How false information fabricated by a reporter and  launched at a critical moment, a dramatic moment when decisions  were being made, how that information was accepted by a certain  group of people with relief because they said to themselves:  fine, now we do not have to intervene because that would be  inconvenient.    But I want to say that it is an insult to the dead, the  people buried here, the commission is an insult to those dead  people lying in our graveyards, as well as to the living.    [Announcer] All the more so as it as it was proven who had  fired the shell at Dobrinja the day before [4 February], who  fired the shell at that part of Alipasino Polje, and so on and  on. It can always be proved who killed up to 10 people, but  when it comes to more than that it suddenly becomes impossible.    [Izetbegovic] A shell landed on Dobrinja the day before;  those children were killed. It was established with certainty  that the shell had come from Serb positions, they did not even  bother to deny it. It was concluded that the shell in Markale  was of the same kind, of the same make. In any case, let us not  waste time on that, things are perfectly clear. It was fired by  those who had fired the other 300,000 shells.    [Announcer] What can be done to deblock other towns --  Bihac,  Mostar, Maglaj, and now, particularly at this time, Tesanj --  and to have heavy weapons withdrawn from there as well?    [Izetbegovic] We shall have to see what further arrangements  we shall accept. We accepted the arrangement with Sarajevo  without hesitation because it was in any case envisaged that  Sarajevo should be UN administrated, which is good.    [Announcer] If I am not mistaken, only Mostar is also  envisaged to be EU administered.    [Izetbegovic] We shall probably demand that this is also  applied in the case of Mostar. As to other towns we shall have  to think seriously whether to accept this. I am afraid that  this could bring about the freezing of the situation on the  ground. We would be willing to have these lines positioned  elsewhere, not on the actual front lines. We are analyzing the  question. It is very complex. Admittedly, such a solution  prevents the Chetniks or the other ones making further advances  into our lines, but it also prevents our struggle for freedom.  It prevents us from liberating those lines. So, we shall have  to think seriously what to do about it. I can only tell you  that the question is just being analyzed -- it is very complex.    [Announcer] The same principle could be applied in  protected areas -- Bihac, Gorazde, Srebrenica. The same  principle as in Sarajevo could be applied there and, after all,  that has to be done.    [Izetbegovic] Not exactly the same principle. That is where  the difference lies: in Sarajevo we agreed to surrender our  weapons as well. According to Resolutions 824 and 836, it is  not our obligation to surrender our weapons in the safe areas.  We knew that here the Chetniks would have been delighted if we  had disputed this, they would have then procrastinated the  decision forever. After the contacts with our friends, we  decided to accept the well-known point seven of the NATO  decision, for it suited us in this case. But in other towns we  shall demand consistent implementation of Resolutions 824 and  836, which specify that the Serb weapons, and not ours, must be  withdrawn from the safe areas. This will be our demand.    [Announcer] The situation in Bihac is almost the most  critical, as critical as in Maglaj and in central Bosnia.    [Izetbegovic] We are defending ourselves there with a lot of  success, and there would probably be no problems there if it was  not for the unfortunate [Fikret] Abdic on our back. I believe  that our people would not accept a Sarajevo-type solution in  Bihac. We would accept Resolution 836, and that is what we  shall insist upon.    General Rose and Akashi wanted to bring it up two or three  days ago, on Friday or Saturday. I asked them to postpone it  until this week, to avoid complicating the situation in  Sarajevo. We want to resolve the question of Sarajevo, and  anyway General Delic is travelling to the UNPROFOR base in  Zagreb for the talks with Akashi, General Rose, and General Cot.    [Announcer] To sum it up now. If the West decides, as it has  decided this time, to issue a threat, it means that something  can be done.    [Izetbegovic] We have earlier said that the recipe is to  combine negotiations and pressure; that is force. This is the  only formula leading towards the achieving of some objective.  We have been constantly told, throughout the 18 months of the  war, to negotiate and negotiate. We said that it could not  produce any results. It can, if combined with a pressure on the  aggressor. It has been proven here that this is the only  successful and efficient formula.    [Announcer] One interesting question: the Serbs got the  corridor in Posavina. Why cannot we get such a corridor linking  us with Bihac?    [Izetbegovic] People often ask that question. I think that  the wrong verb is used here. They did not get it, they took it.  They are holding the corridor militarily. We cannot take it  back from them. If we can, we shall take it. In this war one  does not get anything, nobody gives anything to anyone as a  present. Everything has to be taken. They have taken it.  Please, let our people bear this in mind when they say: why  are you giving them something. We are not giving them anything.  They have simply, as you know, taken it by force, a vast force  in comparison with our forces, and they will not give it back.  They will not give it back although our rights to it are  evident. But they have seized it, we have not given it to them.    [Announcer] Let us end this part of our program with a  report  from the White House. Today again a warning has arrived from  there that the ultimatum is still in force, and that all heavy  weapons within the 20-km zone that are not under UN control will  be targeted by air attacks.    [Izetbegovic] In that respect the U.S. position is very  clear. The French and German positions are clear up to a point,  the English one to a lesser extent, the Russian almost not at  all. But the important thing is that in this respect the  American position is very clear. I think that they are leading  the game here.    [Announcer] We have received many questions for you. Let us  start with politics. We have received some new initiatives.  Russia launched an initiative that was rejected. Now we have a  French initiative again. What is really taking place in  connection with the global resolution of problems in  Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] Something is taking place behind the scenes.  Nothing is happening on the main stage. Talks involving experts  were held in Bonn today [22 February]. I do not know the  outcome of the meeting. I think it ended late this evening, an  hour or two ago. I do not know if the results will be made  public. Experts from several states involved in the problem  took part, including America and Russia and some European  states. They were supposed to make some kind of project,  perhaps some kind of plan for that hypothetical summit that was  discussed and that would have Bosnia on its agenda.    As far as our activities are concerned, as you are aware, we  held negotiations with the Croatian side two days ago in  Frankfurt, between Silajdzic and Granic. Silajdzic has been in  the United States since yesterday. He held talks with  Christopher yesterday and I think he will meet him again. Today  he held talks with other American officials. Therefore,  something is cooking, but most of it is taking place behind the  scenes. We shall see the outcome. We know our positions and we  will defend them adequately. We have several options in mind,  depending on the direction in which the things move. However,  our people's interest will be protected in all options.    [Announcer] Nothing has been solved in Geneva. Are we  finally going to ask the UN Security Council to take everything  in its hands?    [Izetbegovic] It is most likely that another round of talks  will take place and, should it fail, there is nothing left to do  but to return to the United Nations again. If that happens we  would remind them of their resolutions, of the London  Conference, and so on. However, I think that another round of  talks will take place, yet another attempt to find a solution  based on previous projects.    [Announcer] The issue of Croatia and the presence of its  regular army in Bosnia-Herzegovina is on the agenda of the UN  Security Council. What do you expect will happen with that  problem?    [Izetbegovic] Well, I did not watch the evening newscast  because I was on the way to your studio. I do not know if the  Security Council discussed the issue today. I have instructed  our delegation to delay a decision on the matter for a day or  two because we are holding intense negotiations with the Croats  over certain issues. Delic is going to Zagreb tomorrow where he  is supposed to meet General Roso. Delic will demand the  withdrawal of Croatian troops again, although Roso has denied  the presence of these troops in a recent statement. What counts  is UNPROFOR's [UN Protection Force] verdict according to which  at least 5,000 well- equipped troops are present. They will  have to withdraw them or they will face sanctions. We have no  doubt about this and neither does the international community.  It is only a matter of days for some kind of peaceful solution  to the problems.    [Announcer] You mentioned the talks between Messrs.  Silajdzic  and Granic, but after the talks it was said that another meeting  would be held at the highest level. Does that mean that you and  President Tudjman will meet?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, if any results are achieved. I must be  frank: It does not seem at the moment that there will be any  results. I am not an optimist regarding a solution to the  problems between us and Croatia, which are not our fault. We  are trying to solve those problems. After all, I do not think  we should fight if we can solve this by agreement for people to  stop suffering.    Our people in Vitez -- in the old part of Vitez -- in Novi  Travnik, and Mostar are in a very difficult situation. The  situation in the old part of Vitez is particularly difficult.  There are about 1,000 of our citizens there who have been cut  off for a long time. Of course, there are more hotspots, such  as Gornji Vakuf.    [Announcer] It seems that the situation is calming down  there. There was not much fighting there today.    [Izetbegovic] Yes, it has quieted down somewhat. UNPROFOR  has been trying: They bring up the Sarajevo solution; whether it  would be possible to apply a similar solution there.    That is why Gen. Delic will go to Zagreb tomorrow. We have  tried to organize the meeting here, but Akashi could not come to  Sarajevo because he has a lot of work to do in Zagreb tomorrow.  I was very enthusiastic about Akashi's presence. He offered  for the meeting to take place at Sarajevo airport without him or  at Zagreb airport where he would be present. So we agreed for  Delic to go there because we are interested in finding a  solution. I am not a great optimist concerning all this,  judging by certain indications that I have had. However,  miracles are possible.    [Announcer] There has been talk about new proposals of a  confederation. It has been said that the West and the United  States want it.    [Izetbegovic] The U.S. wish, which has been conveyed to us,  is that we solve our problem with Croats. They believe that  this is in the interest of both Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia.  When they said Croats, they referred to our internal  misunderstanding with Bosnian Croats and to the two states.  They advised us and suggested we try to find a solution because  that would greatly simplify the problem of implementing the  agreement. On the other hand, they said very clearly that they  would lend their support to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia  concerning their joining future European integrations, and they  would give us assistance for a speedy reconstruction of both  countries and so on. Therefore, they have given us very  appealing offers to encourage us to proceed in that direction.    [Announcer] We have to remember that Boban has been  replaced.  A new president of the so-called Herzeg-Bosna has been elected,  but Prime Minister Jadranko Prlic has said that Mostar will be  the capital of that parastate. In that area there is nothing  new.    [Izetbegovic] We have always said that the replacement of  Boban was important, for moral reasons as well. We believe that  he is to blame for the suffering down there. He organized the  war crimes in Herzegovina, and partly here in Bosnia. But we  have always said that it was not important to replace Boban, but  to change the policy. I am afraid that there has been no change  in policy.    [Announcer] Convoys have reached Zenica -- if I am not  mistaken -- and Nova Bila. I think that the one for Maglaj has  failed to go through again.    [Izetbegovic] The one for Maglaj has unfortunately not  passed  through because of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council]  objections. However, these indications of a change in the  policy are very unconvincing. Much more should be done to be  able to say that a change in the policy is on the agenda. I  cannot see that for the time being.    I know that Germany and America -- primarily those two  countries, but also other European countries including Belgium  and Holland -- insist on us solving our problems with Croatia.  They insist the Croats do too, they exert pressure on them too.  They have also suggested to us that a solution is in our  interest. We will see whether all this yields result in the  next few days. Unfortunately, for the time being I cannot see  any progress.    [Announcer] We have received many questions from our  viewers.  We have already answered most of them. I will try not to repeat  questions. Still, there are a lot of questions that have not  been answered. Let us start from here: Has Bosnia-Herzegovina  been divided despite all these negotiations?    [Izetbegovic] Regarding the reconstruction of  Bosnia-Herzegovina: Some kind of draft, a project on this has  been made -- that is true. Specifically, this is the  reconstruction of Bosnia- Herzegovina, which some people call  division and which at the same time could and could not be a  division depending on the direction things develop in the  future. Optimists could interpret the union as a form, a way of  keeping Bosnia together at this most critical moment when it is  in the greatest danger, when there are three armies operating  within it, and when the situation cannot possibly deteriorate  further but only improve in the future. Therefore, the union  would be a guarantee for a future reintegration of Bosnia,  because the framework would be preserved. Pessimists believe  that this is a phase in the disintegration of Bosnia-Herzegovina.    History is not prefabricated. What Bosnia will become  depends to a large extent on us. It depends on our efforts, on  our struggle. We will try to preserve Bosnia-Herzegovina, to  realize the beliefs of the optimists. I explained on one  occasion how we imagine this if it turns out that no solution is  possible other than the union and the three republics, which is  currently on the agenda because nothing else has been offered.  In fact, we did offer the internal set-up envisaging cantons,  but I think that neither the Serb nor Croat sides accepted it.  If we are talking about solving the problem by agreement, that  will not work. Bosnia- Herzegovina could perhaps be reunited by  military means on some new basis. The solution that seems to be  rather realistic today, the direction in which things are going,  is the union and the republics, among which our Bosnian republic  would be the example of a democratic country that would exert  influence on the integration of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the  strength of its political model. Therefore, what  Bosnia-Herzegovina will turn out to be if it becomes a union  depends to a large extent on us.    [Announcer] We have answered many of these questions: Is  this  a division of the city? Is this the freezing of the situation  in Sarajevo? But there is one interesting question. A viewer  called and asked whether you know about new concentration camps  -- for example near Han Pijesak, in Mrkalj, and in Pjenovac --  whether the International Red Cross knows about them and what is  being done concerning that?    [Izetbegovic] We have heard about these things and informed  Mazowiecki -- you know that he is the UN secretary general's  envoy for human rights on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. His latest report was made public yesterday [21  February]. We have also informed the Red Cross. However, it is  difficult to reach those areas. If commissions come to inspect,  the Serbs relocate the camps and hide the inmates.  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to solve that problem with  them.    However, we have people who deal exclusively with that issue  and who follow the problem of human rights, the concentration  camps, and crimes. They are in constant contact with the Red  Cross and relevant bodies. We have managed to do a lot in that  area. Many camps have been discovered and many people released  owing to those efforts. Many people have been exchanged and  saved. We have recently held talks on the release of some of  our civilians from Kiseljak. We are talking about 500-600  civilians. I think that we will manage to free them in the next  two or three days.    [Announcer] How do you comment on this escalation of evil,  violence and everything else that has befallen us in almost 23  months in this region?    [Izetbegovic] It is a phenomenon that will probably attract  the attention of the world's scientists. It has truly had no  precedent -- and this is not an empty phrase. It is difficult  to find something to compare it with in the history of the past  few hundred years. We are talking about the killing and  expulsion of people, about the destruction of cultural  monuments, and so on.    The question arises of how such evil could happen here. Some  people will say: The root of the evil was in Nacertanije  [writings on Serbian national issues] by a Serbian nationalist  late last century and early this century. But Nacertanije  existed before too. It is a very interesting question -- how  this evil has been brought about. I have a feeling that no  moral force rose in opposition to the evil.    I think that the 40 years of Communist rule here will  probably have to be included in the explanation of this  phenomenon. That ideology propagated that everything is  allowed. If you read the Communist Manifesto, you will see that  they say that morality is an illusion and so on. Morality is  only that which is useful for a future aim, or -- as they used  to say in the better part of their rule -- what is useful for  the working class and then what is useful for the ruling class.  Everything is allowed. In my opinion, that destroyed all moral  buttresses. Nationalists came to power in a moral wasteland,  and they implemented their policies without any obstacles. No  moral values opposed them. There are nationalists such as we  see today in Russia, such as Zhirinovskiy. There is xenophobia  in, for example, Germany. There are always people who will  preach evil, but they fail to implement it on a large scale.  [passage indistinct]    I have a feeling that nothing opposed the evil here. Very  little in people rose in resistance. Something was destroyed in  people -- their criteria, their moral values. People grew up  and were educated with the idea that everything was allowed in  the name of authority. All that was needed was for bad  authorities to come to power to do whatever they wanted. And  that is precisely what happened. I think that while explaining  why it was in this region that such evil happened, my  explanation is that the communist ideology also bears the blame  for it.    [Announcer] Let us continue with questions from our viewers.    In Zenica, they have an electricity as well as a phone link  with Sarajevo. Is the president familiar with the serious  situation in Zenica and, above all, with the fact that the  citizens are dissatisfied with the work of the Zenica  government? The following question arises: Why does the Zenica  government not want to accept the UNHCR's offer whereby it would  take over the bakery and provide bread? The UNHCR claims it can  solve this problem.    [Izetbegovic] I was not aware of that. I know that there is  some criticism. I am aware of some complaints, although-- given  the distance--Zenica is almost a two days' walk from here. You  know, I find it easier to know what is going on in the United  States. It is a matter of five minutes. Whereas, for example,  I have no phone link to Konjic. All kinds of things may take  place in Konjic, but it can take me five days to learn of them,  until the couriers who operate there arrive.    Communications have been disrupted. I have to admit there  are complaints as far as Zenica is concerned. The police, the  authorities, are being criticized, etc. People always complain.  You cannot simply take every complaint and criticism at its face  value. You have to examine every element. Still, this detail  about the UNHCR and, as you mentioned, the bakery....    [Announcer, interrupting] Or what about another example. Why  is it impossible to organize in Zenica the distribution and  production of bread in the same way as in Sarajevo? In Zenica,  the price of flour is 20 German marks. Adem Dervisevic from  Zenica.    [Izetbegovic] These are good questions. I hope the people of  Zenica as well as Zenica's authorities are listening to this.  Let them try to explain this issue to those people there.    [Announcer] Here you go. Can the state do something to help  workers, particularly those who are now living in Zenica but who  worked and lived in the temporarily occupied areas?    [Izetbegovic] That is a totally justified question. It  should be addressed to the government. As you know, the  government has recently, government representatives have been  doing some field work, examining this situation, and talking to  people. They have been trying to find some solution. There are  a large number of reports indicating that the situation in  Zenica is extremely grave with regard to the humanitarian  situation and food. It seems that the highest prices are being  charged there at the moment. There is no flour. I can take  notice of this....    [Announcer, interrupting] That was probably the reason  behind  such a question. [words indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] It is also a message to the local official  there, so they can perhaps take a hard look at what they are  doing if their citizens are making these complaints. I will  take notice. All I can say is that tomorrow I will phone them  in Zenica, and I will draw the government's attention to the  complaints we have heard tonight.    [Announcer] One of our viewers asks: When will we dispense  with municipal officials?    [Izetbegovic] I do not know. In what sense? Municipal  officials are needed and will be needed in every situation....    [Announcer, interrupting] Is it your impression--you have  toured extensively throughout our territory--that these  municipal officials have now seized too much power?    [Izetbegovic] I believe that the viewer is right inasmuch  that we also have realized that municipalities are attempting,  due to this existing isolation, due to the fact that we had  absolutely no communications until a few months ago [sentence as  heard]. Municipalities had gone independent. They turned into  statelets of sorts. We have realized this, and now we are  trying, if possible, to trim that kind of autonomy a bit, to  consolidate the state as this would be in everyone's interest.  Municipalities have begun to conduct themselves in a  self-interested way. It will not give the electricity if it has  the electricity, or it will not give flour if it has flour, etc.  I believe that the new government is trying to tackle this  issue and that they are doing something.    You know how difficult it is to reclaim power from those who  have seized it? It is easier to press the cork into the bottle  than to take it out.    [Izetbegovic] A lady from Zenica asks: Are municipal  authorities authorized to impound privately owned goods? Well,  here we have Zenica again. It is indicative....    [Izetbegovic, interrupting] It is indicative. This is all  coming from Zenica. Yes, there are some situations, although  they have to be explicitly listed under the law. There are some  cases, but I am not sure whether the number of these cases is  high. Only in exceptional cases, of course, can the state  interfere with private property. Only in exceptional situations.    [Announcer] What are the plans for central Bosnia, for  Maglaj? We also have many questions about other areas. Will  anything be done about the lifting of the blockade of Tesanj,  Teslic, Maglaj, and the free territory of Doboj? When and how  will this happen? How can the people there be helped?    [Izetbegovic] Of course, these are military issues, and  soldiers would hold it against me if I revealed their plans.  However, the soldiers have faced that issue of lifting the  blockade of Maglaj for days. As far as aid to Maglaj is  concerned, we have tried to push convoys through. We have done  everything we could-- sometimes even what we should not have  done--in order to send them the convoys. The other day we  managed to get a convoy through to the very entrance to Maglaj  but, as you know, some civilians allegedly stopped the convoy at  the very last checkpoint. The convoy returned to Zenica, and  then to Belgrade.    [Announcer] The UNHCR says that people there are dying of  starvation. The other day almost 10 people (?died).    [Izetbegovic] Yes, they know that. That is when we  intervened. They increased the amount of air-dropped aid because  this is more or less what Maglaj survives on. The air  drops--aid dropped by parachutes--were increased. We ensured  that aid is dropped and that it is dropped in the right place  because it used to fall all over the place. There have been  fewer mistakes recently. We are trying to send convoys, but  sometimes we are completely powerless.    With regard to lifting the blockade, that is an issue that  is  on the agenda.    [Announcer] We have a question here by a soldier who has  fought since the first day of the war. Could the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army have done more and liberated more  territories? I think that this question is very  interesting--all the more so since we had to liberate all  territories. When we remember what happened in the beginning of  the war--the total occupation and all the corps of the former  Yugoslav People's Army [JNA] that took control of almost all of  our republic--it is obvious that we, after all, liberated  everything we have now ourselves.    [Izetbegovic] Yes, that soldier used the right word when he  said that we could have liberated more territory than we have.  Practically, we have liberated all the territory we have today.    The people of Sarajevo know that best. There were six or  seven barracks here from which the JNA had to be expelled. JNA  soldiers were wandering around the city until 2 May. The  situation was the same throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. Could we  have done more? Perhaps it is not the time now to assess that.  You know, one always asks oneself whether one could have done  more, what would have happened had one done something different.    A few days ago I listened to one of their high-ranking  generals, who said that they could have captured Sarajevo. He  made this claim and went as far as giving details of how the  Serbs showed themselves as cowards and saying that they should  have done specific things on a day when he had asked them to in  order to cut Sarajevo in two. I remember those days, and [words  indistinct]. That is when there was fighting around the Marshal  Tito barracks. We negotiated for them to hand over the  barracks. Their other generals did not allow that. What we  agreed on during the day was undone at night. A general goes to  Lukavica, comes back, and says that the agreement was changed.  They tried to cut the city in two in that area.    They can regret this and say that they failed to do  something. We can say that we could have had Ilidza with a  little bit more perseverance. Ilidza would have been ours if we  had reacted at the right moment. You know that we were in  Ilidza. I mention only Ilidza, but the viewer who asked the  question did not refer only to Sarajevo but also to other areas.  I just wanted to illustrate that we could have done more in  certain areas. We know that in Sarajevo we may have been able  to keep Ilidza if we had sent only about 100 to 200 people at  the right moment; however, there is no second chance there. We  lost Ilidza. We did not react in time, and people had to  withdraw. We could have had Ilidza, and the situation would  perhaps be completely different.    [Announcer] [passage indistinct]    [Izetbegovic] A list of mistakes, of unlikely successes, and  strange failures will probably be drawn up later. I think that  there will be many more successes that will surprise people than  failures. However, it is certain that there have been failures  that could have been prevented--such as the fall of Doboj and  Trnovo. Commissions have been set up to analyze this, as well as  the incident on Igman. Did it have to happen? All  circumstances indicate that it did not have to happen and that  it was due to personal shortcomings.    [Announcer] One of our viewers asks about the military  situation and the further organization of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Army.    [Izetbegovic] All I can say is that the Army is being  constantly worked on in the sense that it is being strengthened,  and that discipline is being stepped up. This is very  important; there are no everlasting commanders. You will see.  There will soon be a series of personnel changes in the Army.  They are being prepared at the moment. I think that the  decisions will be reached in two or three days. We are  constantly trying to improve the situation in the Army by  introducing changes, by promoting and appointing people who have  proved themselves, by removing and replacing people who were not  good, and by appointing to front lines and commanding positions  those people who have proved to be good. Naturally, personnel  issues are very delicate and difficult, and all sorts of  mistakes can be made, but we are trying to improve the situation  by constantly changing people. We also step up discipline.    The political department is active. They have recently  issued a series of very useful booklets. Every army must have a  political platform. It must know what it wants and how it plans  to fight. Therefore, big steps have been made in that respect.    Foreigners have acknowledged that this is a real army. Of  course, there is a lot more to do. I have mentioned the  specific things that we are doing at the moment. We are working  on the strengthening of Army personnel by making certain changes.    [Announcer] Various newspapers--I read some new papers that  have appeared in Sarajevo--recently criticized the Army  leadership, especially the people who have come from the former  Yugoslav People's Army. I think that there were a lot of unjust  accusations.    [Izetbegovic] It would be inappropriate for me to assess  this  publicly. You would like to know what our strategy is? Our  strategy is to create in peacetime a small and very effective  army. Not a numerically large army, but a very effective,  well-equipped, and well-trained army. Perhaps even a  professional army, which will not have more than 20,000 to  30,000 personnel. Our army currently has something over 200,000  people because we are at war.    [Announcer] An army that can, with the MUP [Ministry of  Internal Affairs], defend everything we create?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, it can defend everything. At the moment,  we are trying to have as many mobile units as possible in the  Army. Most units were not mobile. The Army is very large, and  it can defend areas to which it is attached. Now we want to  create mobile units; in fact, we are already creating them.  There already is a certain number of mobile units, which is  increasing every day. In any event, the perspective of our  country is to create a small, effective, well-armed,  well-equipped, and well-trained army.    [Announcer] What about members of the Patriotic League  before  the war? How can they survive in such conditions, with the  humanitarian aid they receive?    [Izetbegovic] With difficulty.    [Announcer] Soldiers and the wounded from the Patriotic  League organized a meeting in Zenica, also attended by the  families of the dead soldiers. Who takes care of them?    [Izetbegovic] That is one of the elements of our state of  affairs seen realistically. Some people here euphorically set  some impossible goals without taking into account the actual  state of affairs. Unfortunately, we who receive reports every  day know the real state of affairs. It could be  described--especially morale--as unusually high. The people's  morale is surprisingly high--their readiness to fight and  sacrifice themselves. On the other hand, of course, we have  problems with food and the so-called (?MTS). We do not hide  that.    Speaking about arms, we capture most of them, we produce  some  of them, and we import some. We are trying various paths to get  something in, but that has been reduced recently because we are  under a complete blockade. So--talking about the Army--we  provide most weapons by capturing them from the enemy. These  are not negligible amounts, but rather large  quantities--sometimes very large--because they have a lot of  weapons, and our actions occasionally yield results. We capture  a certain amount of ammunition and arms, and we also make some.    [Announcer] Well, we have been talking for over an hour,  let us take a look at humanitarian aid. The situation is  extremely grave. You have singled out Zenica, central Bosnia.  I would also add Sarajevo and eastern Bosnia to this list.  What is going with regard to humanitarian aid?    [Izetbegovic] I do not have to conceal that this was a  case.... [pauses] At some stages, humanitarian aid has been  used as a method of pressing us. There was a drop in  deliveries, you know. A person who regulates them, who holds  the tap, turned them down a little so that we could feel what  hunger and cold was and, hence, be more pliable regarding some  concessions, political concessions. You could feel it on the  ground. There has been no abundance of anything since the  outbreak of war. In many places, however, the shortages had  already reached a critical point.    It came as a result of this trickling tap policy of  humanitarian aid, covered by some excuses to the effect that  nothing could be done--that due to one attack in one location  there could be no deliveries for a month, or an airport would be  closed, Sarajevo airport, for example. Central Bosnia was in a  very serious situation in some periods. I believe that, in that  respect, conditions will get somewhat better and that perhaps we  have already experienced the worst phase. It is no longer such  a grave threat. We have been tested. We are leaving this  winter, an icy winter, behind us.    We have refused to make unprincipled political concessions.  I believe that they have not yielded any result, and I believe  that this method will no longer be used. That is provided, of  course, that our impression is correct that it was a result of  what we perceive as deliberate moves. They claim that this was  not the case, that it was a result of some other  circumstances--snow, lack of safety, etc.    Let us wait and see. All in all, I believe that this method  will no longer be used, so there will be a more positive  situation in the near future in that regard. That is all the  more so because the snow will melt away. You have mentioned the  convoys that have arrived. There is also a huge delivery that  is yet to arrive; it is expected to arrive from the direction of  Split and Zagreb. It is being organized by a combination of  Muslim and Catholic humanitarian organizations....    [Announcer, interrupting] [word indistinct] Mr. Separovic  while he was in Sarajevo?    [Izetbegovic] There are huge amounts of food. It is  available there. It only has to be transported. We have a  transport problem in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    That is why we are making these efforts to calm down the  situation on the ground. It is something people should know.  Food must come. That is our imperative. At the moment, this is  the law above all laws; food must reach Bosnia.    [Announcer] Could we have done more? We know our situation  with regard to necessities--gas, electricity, etc. We know how  everything goes. Yet we have no oil, no logs. For example, we  are distributing humanitarian aid beans, although most elderly  people and those who are all alone have no means of cooking  these beans.    [Izetbegovic] I would not say that we could have done more.  We even reached a point when we were ready to buy heating fuel  from the chetniks. We even authorized someone to carry this  out, to [words indistinct]. They spotted it and changed their  mind. They did not want to give wood to us. That is how far we  went because we feared that people would be dying in the cold.    Luckily enough, this has been a rather mild winter, except  for the past few days. When it was at its harshest in December  and January, however, we went as far as this. We believed that  one day we would be able to explain to the people why we bought  wood from the chetniks. Well, put simply, it was so you do not  die from exposure here. They, however, cancelled it at the last  moment. Hence, we had come close to and perhaps gone beyond the  limit of-- shall I say--the permissible in order to come up with  a solution.    What we could have done, though, .... [pauses] We have now  created a program. Last year--perhaps the general public does  not know this--we imported a huge quantity of seed on time.  This year we have drawn up again a program according to which  every square meter will be sown. A draft law has now been set  in motion that.... [pauses] There is a great deal of abandoned  land, particularly in central Bosnia and in the Bosnia valley.  People have fled. We are not going to tolerate this land not  being cultivated. We are going to introduce a law so as to  enable municipalities to give this land on temporary loan, for  one year only. It would be extended every year for as long as  the war goes on. Municipalities will give a plot of land and  seeds to refugees. This will be far from any kind of advanced  agriculture. There is no fuel for the tractors. People will  have to sow in an old-fashioned way.    The government is doing its best to make sure that not a  single patch remains unsown--whatever land is under the  government's control--so we can end up with a maximum harvest of  vegetables.    Last year we did a great deal, and partly thanks to this we  had enough potatoes, a considerable amount of fruit was picked.  As you know, there were enough vegetables....    [Announcer, interrupting] On balconies.    [Izetbegovic] Yes, on balconies etc. We distributed it  systematically. However, humanitarian aid was not in our hands.  What was up to us was not to create disruptions in the delivery  of humanitarian aid. This is why people think we were  subservient in a sense -- we did not want to bring about a  situation in which there would be no humanitarian aid.    [Announcer] Talking here, let us tell people whether there  will be any improvements in gas, electricity, opening special  corridors -- you said very little about this. Are the United  Nations, UNPROFOR going to take control of the gas valves,  waterworks, and suchlike?    [Izetbegovic] We have a crisis headquarters, headed by  Ganic.  There are some other people, civilian and military people,  civilian experts in this body. They are tasked with examining,  in cooperation with UNPROFOR, how to open up Sarajevo in such a  way that there will be benefits rather than damage from this  opening up.    Many people perhaps have not much idea about the kind of  damage that may ensue. There are some very problematic things  that might arise from the opening of the city. We will be  striving to open up the city in a way that will benefit the city  without problems arising from this. Electricity, I believe,  will soon return. It, electric power, has gradually stabilized  at 20 MW. We used to have 20, and then it would drop to 6, to  zero, and then back to 6 etc. Things have stabilized somewhat in  this respect. We nevertheless believe that we will soon be able  to get 70.    If there are no extraordinary circumstances, this will  probably take place toward the end of this week. Saturday,  Sunday we may get an extra 50 KW. This will make it possible  for a considerable number of Sarajevans to receive electric  power, at least four hours a day. This is what the power  network expects.    As for gas, we are sometimes in a very difficult situation,  we are on the brink of turning it off altogether. The Serb side  is playing a game with this gas. We are in a position to cut  their gas as well as our own. We can do it at any time if the  amount of gas here in Sarajevo falls below a certain minimum  level.    They are, however, holding us in what our people describe as  a situation of too little to live on, too much to die. There is  not enough gas. These quantities are, however, not so small as  to make it sensible for us to cut it off altogether. The bakery  would be then threatened etc. As far as gas goes, I am not  really certain that there will be soon any improvements. I do  not believe there will be any improvements soon.    [Announcer] What is the Presidency and government going to  do  about the disastrous humanitarian situation in Kakanj? Is it  possible to do something more about the delivery of baby food to  Zenica?    [Izetbegovic] I can only say that there is a committee  working on the matter. They are doing their best but  humanitarian aid is not in our hands.    [Announcer] We have four identical questions here: Is Tuzla  airport to be opened? If so, when?    [Izetbegovic] If you want my prediction, I believe that the  airport will be open. At some point my prediction was late  February or early March. I still cling to this prediction --  late February or early March.    [Announcer] We have already heard some hints. As far as I  know, I heard it today, the airport is supposed to officially  reopen on 7 March, so it seems you are right.    [Izetbegovic] Yes, but I made my prediction 15, 20 days ago,  if you remember that occasion.    [Announcer] Let us go back to some other matters. What about  Serb artillery in Ahatovici, Butilo, Paljevo, Rajlovac, in other  words, behind Stup?    [Izetbegovic] According to some reports, well, in any case  artillery has been either removed beyond the 20-km radius or  placed under [UNPROFOR] control. There is the odd abandoned  artillery piece that is being collected by UNPROFOR....    [Announcer, interrupting] [words indistinct] some districts.    [Izetbegovic] Except those pieces that are hidden, those  pieces that are possibly hidden underground. In all probability  UNPROFOR will spot or has already spotted these abandoned  artillery pieces, and transfer them by helicopter and group them  in certain locations.    [Announcer] In some five places, if I am not wrong.    [Izetbegovic] It was first assembled in eight places and  they  are now regrouping it in five places. As Mr. [name indistinct]  said last night, they need to tighten, as they put it, the  battlefield, in order to ease their control. I do not think  that we will have any problems in that respect. Some artillery  pieces have definitely been sent to Kiseljak, according to some  information that we have. It was sold or given away there.  Some of their weapons most probably ended up there.    [Announcer] As they have been doing so far, they have been  selling their artillery.    [Izetbegovic] We have such reports, I must admit they are  not  confirmed, but came from very reliable sources.    [Announcer] What will happen to the heavy artillery after  two  years, a viewer asks. I think that the fate of it will be  resolved before that.    [Izetbegovic] The fate of the weaponry once peace is  restored  is not resolved at the moment. We do not know what will happen  to the artillery. Of course, we will request that it be  destroyed. That will be the best solution.    [Announcer] What are the prospects for the return of  refugees? Now we could mention all the refugees, but a viewer  from Zagreb has raised this question in particular. When is  this going to be possible?    [Izetbegovic] Refugees are one of our main motives in our  painstaking negotiations with Croatia, following so many  unsuccessful negotiations -- and now we are again doing the  same. It is our feeling that without an agreement with Croatia  we cannot return the refugees. Roads are closed, airports are  closed. They should be enabled to go somewhere, to travel along  the road from Split to Sarajevo. Hence, our refugees are our  main motive in these negotiations as we are trying in one way or  another to reach some agreement with Croatia.    It is our desire to enable as soon as possible these people  to return. Since this cease-fire in Sarajevo went into effect I  have been receiving hundreds of letters and messages saying that  people would like to return to the city. They want to know how  they can return. In my replies I write of course as much as I  can, as I cannot reply to every letter, that they should be  patient for some time. The return of these refugees will  nevertheless have to be done via Croatia and via the  Ploce-Mostar-Sarajevo road or the Split -Sarajevo road. We must  reach some agreement on this matter. This is a kind of  imperative we have tasked ourselves with, we are tasked with  solving this issue. First, we would, of course, withdraw the  refugees from Croatia.    [Announcer] Talking about this, the question also arises of  returning people to the strip here along the Drina river in  particular, i.e. eastern Bosnia, including the question of why  Foca has been bypassed in all the negotiations so far on drawing  eventual borders. Why is it not included in the 15 disputed  areas although Foca always had a majority Muslim population?  After all, this point was raised in Geneva, as far as I  remember, including the majority Muslim populations in eastern  Bosnia as per the 1991 census [sentence as heard]. What is the  present position of this entire area in the negotiations?    [Izetbegovic] We have a basic, rather broad formula. We say,  give us back our areas, our land and you will have peace -- this  is our message to the other side. When we say our areas, we  refer to those areas where the Bosnian population was in the  majority according to the 1991 census.    [Announcer] Cajnice, Foca, Rudo, Visegrad [words indistinct]  are of strategic importance to us....    [Izetbegovic, interrupting] In Cajnice we unfortunately were  not in the majority....    [Announcer, interrupting] What about Rogatica, for example,  where we were?    [Izetbegovic] We demand that they are given back. According  to this formula we advocate -- it was the Assembly's position  too, if you remember, this is precisely how it is formulated --  we can demand our majority areas. And we will demand them. We  are determinedly carrying on in this direction, we have not been  giving in, as you know, during over one year of negotiations.  This is our message again. This was the instruction given to  Silajdzic before he left for these talks. For now it is  impossible to predict how the negotiations will end because  various great powers are at play here. We, however, cannot give  up this principle. It is a kind of platform passed by the  assembly.    [Announcer] Can the presidency do something to help the  Muslims who are still in Banja Luka? Yesterday, we saw some  footage of dead people, they were killed there?    [Izetbegovic] Hardly anything. What we can do and what we  are doing at the moment is to inform international organizations  and the public, international organizations in particular, as it  is their duty to take care of this. Regretfully, I have to  state, though, that it is not an effective method.    Nobody is ready to react, verbally yes, but not to take  concrete measures. They deem that for this reason they imposed  the sanctions against Serbia but are not ready to enter Banja  Luka and liberate those people. Whether we will ever be able to  do that is open to question.    [Announcer] A question from Sipovo. When are we going to  return home? What will happen to the western part of  Herzegovina? The association of citizens of Grbavica and Vrace  asks when they are going to return home. There are very many  question of this sort.    [Izetbegovic] As to Grbavica and Vrace, I think that a while  ago I replied to that question. The situation there is somewhat  clearer than that regarding Sipovo or Banja Luka.    [Announcer] Now, toward the end of the program, some more  questions remain to be answered. I think they are interesting,  but I think it is primarily up to our government to reply to  them. If you are ready, may we reply to them as well? What  does the Presidency think about students drafted into the army?  Will it enable them to continue the school year 1993-94? Are  you thinking about sending some exceptional students from  Sarajevo who have been admitted to some universities in Europe  and elsewhere in the world? Finally, once educated, they are  going to be useful as experts.    [Izetbegovic] In that respect we have to be very cautious in  what we are doing. We should neither stop the process of  education of talented people who can obtain education, nor on  the other hand should be approach that process too liberally,  because by this means we are weakening our army. Not because of  the departure of a couple of dozen people, but because people  here ask the question of who will defend the country, why should  some people go to live and study comfortably in America or  Turkey and so on, while we are getting killed here and so on.    That is a very delicate issue. I think that in this respect  a rational solution must be found. We must not be left without  cadres, because we will not get far. One day we will restore  peace, we will have a state, that state and society need  educated people. No state can do without them. No state can  allow itself such luxury as to be left without any educated  cadres. Therefore, perhaps we will have to examine that issue  with great sensibility in such a way as to send the real talents  abroad to acquire education. We should not turn down  scholarships that have been offered. However, those to be sent  abroad should be people who have fought over the past two years  and who made their contribution, to be able to be withdrawn from  the army. I think that people who did not fight should not  enjoy such a privilege. But, by this I am not giving a final  reply. Of course, this is a question that needs to be examined  well.    [Announcer] Have you been informed about shooting in Sandzak  over the past two days and the fluid situation in Bijelo Polje?    [Izetbegovic] Yes, I know. As you know we have drawn  attention to the situation in Sandzak. We have done what can be  done in this respect. I think that we have sent a letter to the  UN Security Council, asking it to examine the situation in the  light of the latest developments, the escalation of terror  there. We will have to warn the Security Council to do  something.    However, with regard to the experience that Bosnia has had  with the Security Council in this connection, I think that we  should not count on them to take any effective measures. I do  not believe they would. As regards Sandzak, our strategy will  be to try to tie it to the Bosnian problem. Therefore we put  forward an initiative for a wider conference, some called it the  Balkan conference. We advocated that standpoint in order to  gain the chance to put the Sandzak issue on the agenda. It  should not remain on the sidelines. We cannot tackle it within  the resolution of the Bosnian issue. We can only tackle it if  we extend it. In any case, regardless of the resolution of the  situation in Bosnia, at one time the whole thing will have to be  discussed in a wider context; at least, the complex including  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, and Croatia.    The issue of Sandzak, as soon as we deem it possible to do  so, will be linked to the issue of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we will  try to resolve it in a package. In the meantime we can draw the  attention of the international public and the relevant  organizations to the violation of human rights.    [Announcer] When we are already talking about [words  indistinct], can I ask you about Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM], how do you view the blockade of  the Macedonian borders and how do you view the possibility of  the deployment of fresh U.S. troops in that republic. Would  that be a chance for the Bosnia-Herzegovina issue to be resolved  more quickly?    [Izetbegovic] We have condemned the latest moves by Greece  against Macedonia, which is an independent and sovereign state.  That was also done by the European public, but I do not think  that they did enough in this regard. But, still, the  international public and the international community have  condemned Greece. However, Greece did not find it appropriate to  rectify its behaviour. That is, indeed, a regrettable act.    I do not think that fresh American soldiers will be deployed  down there. Anyhow, their number is only symbolic, but  completely sufficient to make an attack on them an attack on the  United States. That is very clear [words indistinct] the message  is very clear. It is not important whether there are 300 or 600  soldiers [words indistinct]. I think that a military action  against Macedonia cannot be expected.    [Announcer] Do you believe the war will end in May, a viewer  from Tuzla asks. We are nearly at the end of the program, may I  ask you what your prediction is, what will happen in the 23d and  24th month of the aggression against our country?    [Izetbegovic] I have to tell you [words indistinct]. I do  not have the feeling that the war will end that quickly. I do  not have that feeling. It would be good, we are in favor of  restoring peace here as soon as possible. However, our objective  is a fair peace -- I do not think we can expect it in a month or  two. Peace at any price could be signed tomorrow. We have to  fight a bit more to restore a fair peace, we have to work toward  it a bit longer, we still need some more time.    [Announcer] A message for the Sarajevans. Let us end as we  started, can this situation be considered a nucleus of our free  country Bosnia-Herzegovina?    [Izetbegovic] Sarajevo is very important [passage  indistinct].</p>

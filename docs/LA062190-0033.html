			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: THE ART OF MAKING PESTO ;  </P> <P> PESTLE OR PROCESSOR: FINE BASIL PESTO  </P> <P> Although fresh-cut basil is available in supermarket produce sections  year-round, during the summer months this herb is also a popular plant in home  gardens. Sweet basil planted in April or May has grown enough by now to yield  leaves for making pesto, the classic Italian sauce. When harvesting basil,  rather than cutting whole clusters, pinch off just the larger leaves and allow  the smaller ones to continue to grow.  </P> <P> Purists prepare pesto with a mortar and pestle, pounding and grinding the  ingredients into a paste. Chop the basil (Step 1) and place in the mortar. The  garlic may be added whole or minced, along with the pine nuts and grated  Parmesan cheese (Step 2).  </P> <P> Using the pestle, mix and pound the ingredients (Step 3) until thoroughly  combined and almost smooth. Gradually add the olive oil (Step 4), mixing until  the sauce is about the consistency of creamed butter (Step 5). Season to taste  with salt.  </P> <P> Quality pesto may also be prepared with a food processor -- the trick being not  to overprocess the ingredients. Instead of being a creamy, homogenized sauce,  the finished pesto should have a somewhat gritty texture.  </P> <P> Place the cheeses in the processor bowl fitted with the metal blade and process  until well grated. Remove and set aside.  </P> <P> With the motor running, drop the garlic through the feed tube (Step 6) and  process until minced. Remove the cover and push the garlic down into the bowl  with a rubber spatula (Step 7). Add the pine nuts (Step 8) and salt and process  just until finely ground (Step 9).  </P> <P> Add half the basil to the bowl (Step 10) and process with half-second pulses  just until finely chopped (Step 11). Repeat with the remaining basil. Add the  cheeses and pulse to combine.  </P> <P> Turn on the motor and add the oil through the feed tube in a thin stream (Step  12) so the sauce emulsifies. If you don't plan to use pesto immediately, place  in a glass jar and seal by pouring a thin layer of olive oil over the top.  Refrigerate up to four days. Pesto also freezes well; thaw in the refrigerator.  </P> <P> In 1985, Celestino Drago, then executive chef at Chianti restaurant, won grand  prize for his pesto recipe in the Second Annual Basil Festival at Malibu. We  have adapted it for food processor preparation.  </P> <P> BASIL PESTO  </P> <P> 3/4 ounce Pecorino cheese  </P> <P> 1 1/4 ounces Parmigiano Reggiano (Parmesan) cheese  </P> <P> 12 medium cloves garlic  </P> <P> 1/3 cup pine nuts  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon coarse salt  </P> <P> 3 ounces fresh basil leaves  </P> <P> 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil  </P> <P> Place Pecorino and Parmigiano Reggiano cheeses in food processor container  fitted with metal blade. Process until finely grated. Remove and set aside.  </P> <P> With motor running, drop garlic through chute into food processor container and  process until very fine. Remove processor lid and push garlic down into  container with rubber spatula.  </P> <P> Add pine nuts and salt and process until nuts are grated. Add basil leaves in 2  to 3 batches and process with half-second pulses until finely chopped. Add  reserved cheeses and pulse to combine.  </P> <P> With motor running, gradually add oil. Makes about 1 cup.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

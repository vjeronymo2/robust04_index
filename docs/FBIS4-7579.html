			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, March 31 (CTK) -- The government  coalition is seeking to paralyze the control system in Slovakia,  Slovak National Party (SNS) honorary chairman and former  vice-premier in Vladimir Meciar's cabinet Jozef Prokes told  journalists today.    Opposition leaders believe that the dismissal of the  leadership of the Slovak Supreme Inspection Office (NKU) and the  abolition of the Government's Office Control Department testify  to efforts to paralyze the control system in Slovakia, Prokes  said.    The Slovak Parliament, at its last session, dismissed the  NKU  chairman and vice-chairmen. The abolition of the Control  Department in the Government's Office stems from the law on  state administration bodies passed by Parliament, according to  which the Government's Office is no longer a state  administrative organ.    Former SNS deputy and NKU Deputy Chairman Petr Sokol  believes  that his dismissal was an act of political revenge. Sokol  confirmed his intention to lodge a complaint with a civic court  and not with the Constitutional Court because the dismissed  members of the NKU leadership consider the approach adopted  towards them illegal.    Prokes said that the cancellation of the 13 privatization  projects approved at the last session of Meciar's cabinet was an  "international deception." It would be even bigger if "the next  government would cancel the privatization projects of the  current cabinet," he added.    The government of Premier Jozef Moravcik had to cancel at  least 13 privatization projects so as "not to lose face" given  that it had consistently criticized Meciar for his steps in  privatization, Prokes said.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Books: Dark atmospherics - Fiction I AM THE CLAY by Chaim Potok Heinemann Pounds 13.99, 211 pages TURBULENCE by Chico Buarque Bloomsbury Pounds 13.99, 167 pages BAD NEWS by Edward St. Aubyn Heinemann Pounds 13.99, 217 pages THE DIAMOND LANE by Karen Karbo Gollancz Pounds 14.99, 316 pages CHAIM Potok's I am the Clay is a sombre tale of people who need miracles just to survive. Set during the Korean War, an elderly couple are forced to flee their ancestral village when it is overrun by the Chinese. They soon come upon a wounded orphan boy. The woman, seeing in him something of her own long dead son, adopts the child. Her husband is dubious at first, but warms to the boy after he brings a spell of apparently magical luck in the form of food, shelter and safety. Potok's story is a convincing portrayal of the way souls adapt to survive the most horrific of situations, of the way love can sprout through the most charred soil. The author was a front line chaplain in the war, a fact which lends weight to descriptions like the 'stench of iodine and roasting meat' encompassing a pyre of dead refugees. But despite these occasional jolts, there is a strange flatness to the novel, due primarily to its overly sombre language and unsurprising imagery. Also of small surprise is the fact that the best thing about a book called Turbulence is its troubled, dangerous atmosphere. The Brazilian folk singer Chico Buarque's first novel charts a few days in the life of an unnamed man as he circles Rio de Janeiro, making approaches to people and situations without ever really touching down. His journey begins with a sinister knock on the door which sends our hero looking for refuge first with his rich sister, then his ex-wife, and finally his familial farm, which has been taken over by a nebulous group of criminals. He winds up stealing a cache of jewels, which he exchanges for a suitcase of marijuana. Corrupt police enter the story and the book ends with our man bleeding from a chest wound and coming in for a landing. Employing a taut, nervy prose and a telling eye for detail, Buarque expertly depicts a Brazil that is shot through with crime, corruption and dislocation. Unfortunately, having done a fine job setting his violently fragmented scene, he fails to populate it with compelling characters or much of a story. More dark atmospherics are to be found in Edward St. Aubyn's Bad News. His second novel tells the story of Patrick Melrose, a rich and troubled young lad with a nose for narcotics. When he receives the putative 'bad news' that his hated father has died in New York, Patrick hops on Concorde with the intention of dancing on the old boy's grave. En route he makes several detours through Manhattan's upper and nether worlds, imbibing enough mind bending substances to keep a brigade of laboratory rats hopping for months. All, it would seem, in a fruitless attempt to forestall feeling any actual grief for the verbally, physically and sexually abusive father he refuses to mourn. St. Aubyn's high style is able to dip into low places with alarming ease - anyone with questions about heroin abuse among the well-heeled will probably have them answered here. But his satire is a bit off key, giving the book a distinctly nasty edge that is never really redeemed by its knowing vision and cool tone. Karen Karbo's The Diamond Lane is yet another attempt to satirise the film business, though she at least creates characters who are neither rich nor famous. Her story of the marital and professional travails of two Californian sisters is a pleasant enough read, though it is too short on serious laughs or novel insights to make for memorable comedy. Her satire is often a case of setting up straw men who have been knocked down so often that watching them topple again is not worth the effort.</p>

			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian aluminium company plans output expansion India's National Aluminium Company, which owns the country's largest integrated aluminium complex, is expecting the federal government to clear its proposal to expand bauxite (aluminium ore) mining capacity from 2.4m tonnes to 3.6m tonnes and alumina (aluminium oxide) refining capacity from 800,000 tonnes to 1.35m tonnes at a cost of Rs10.56bn (Dollars 336m). According to Mr SK Tamotia, the chairman and managing director, however, Nalco has shelved its plan to build a greenfield, export-oriented alumina refinery with an annual capacity of 900,000 tonnes. In the meantime, Hydro Aluminium of Norway, which was to have partnered Nalco in the alumina venture will be working with Indian Aluminium and Tata Industries to set up a 1m-tonne export-oriented alumina project at a cost of Rs22.50bn at Rayagada district of Orissa. 'The reason we backed out of the alumina project is that we are not sure about its viability,' said Mr Tamotia. 'At the ruling world prices of alumina, the cost of production will not be covered.' The company plans to export 400,000 tonnes of alumina in this fiscal year, compared with 372,000 tonnes in the year to March 31, 1994. 'Nalco is also planning to expand the aluminium smelting capacity at Angul in Orissa from 218,000 tonnes to 330,000 tonnes,' Mr Tamotia said. 'The expansion is to be effected by adding one more potline with 240 pots at the Angul smelter. However, because of our present resource constraint we cannot take up the project immediately.' In the meantime, the cost of the smelter capacity expansion has been brought down from Rs21bn to Rs10bn as Nalco will not be required to create additional captive power capacity following the assurance of power supply by the National Thermal Power Corporation. 'India, where the demand for aluminium is growing at an annual rate of about 5 per cent will need extra smelting capacity. Since the cost of setting up a new smelter will be prohibitive, the existing aluminium producers will have to expand capacity. Last year, India imported nearly 45,000 tonnes of aluminium,' said Mr Tamotia. On paper, India has smelting capacity of 610,000 tonnes. However, this includes the 73,000-tonne smelter of Indian Aluminium at Belgaum in Karnataka, which was de-energised in August 1992 because of 'its highly uneconomic operation'. It is unlikely that the Belgaum smelter will ever again be recommissioned. India's eighth five year plan has projected an aluminium smelting capacity of 772,000 tonnes by 1996-97. Industry officials are unanimous that the target will not be achieved.</p>

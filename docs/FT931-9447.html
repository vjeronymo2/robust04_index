			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Smaller companies find new fans - At a Glance Are small companies getting bigger at last? Optimism is growing, with the launch of a new investment trust (see Page V) and analysts such as John McClure at Guinness Flight are making bullish predictions that smaller companies can out-perform. But shares in smaller companies stood still last week. The Hoare Govett Smaller Companies Index remained virtually unchanged during the week to Thursday, dropping from 1342.07 to 1342.06, while the County NatWest index was similarly almost static, falling from 1047.76 to 1047.71.</p>

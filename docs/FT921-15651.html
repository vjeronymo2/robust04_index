			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / Letter: Industrial improvement is a matter for industry, not policy makers, argue NEDC chairmen Sir, Your leading article ('Engineering a solution', January 8), illustrates vividly the dangers of superficiality in considering what must be done to regenerate British industry. You say that the recommendations contained in our joint paper, 'Engineering at the Crossroads', presented to the NEDC yesterday are 'a feeble restatement of conventional wisdom'. They are not only 'uncontroversial' but also, horror of horrors, 'sensible'. You suggest that we should, by contrast, be pointing out where current policy debates are too short-sighted or closed: auditing policy (presumably you mean government policy); and provoking the imagination of policy makers (presumably, again, within government). While government has an important role in providing the right macroeconomic environment and infrastructure, industrial improvement is not ultimately a matter for policy makers, no matter how imaginative or stimulated. It is an unglamorous, undramatic business of day-to-day improvement within firms which must compete to survive. It needs long-term continuity of purpose, never-ceasing obsession with quality, continuous improvement, good management, workers with appropriate skills for today and the future, co-operation and team-work. That is why the NEDC engineering industry sector group and engineering skills working party are defining the successful new manufacturing techniques in engineering and will market them vigorously; will identify product and technology gaps threatening the engineering supply chain; and will define world class engineering skills and what the UK must do to acquire them. This will improve Britain's long-term industrial performance. They may even help to make us as uncontroversial, sensible and successful as the Germans and the Japanese. Bill Jordan, chairman, NEDC engineering industry sector group, Ian Gibson, chairman, NEDC engineering skills working party, National Economic Development Office, Millbank Tower, Millbank, London SW1P 4QX</p>

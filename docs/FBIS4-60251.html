			<p>CSO     [Text] Legislative and Parliamentary Affairs Division. The  Majles met in open session yesterday chaired by Dr. Rowhani and  the deputies from the cities of Ardel, Tabriz, Qa'enat, Gonabad,  and Qa'em Shahr and Savadkuh gave preagenda speeches. Then the  Majles went into consultation, and we direct the attention of  our esteemed readers to the detailed proceedings.  <H5>  'Ali Yusefpur, Deputy From Ardel </H5>   Excessive increases in products have unfortunately weakened  the Postal Company.    The first preagenda speaker was Yusefpur, deputy from Ardel.  During his speech he discussed the slaughter of Muslims by  Western and especially American agents. He said: The  international organizations, especially the United Nations, have  closed their eyes to these vast crimes, and as time passes they  are watching the destruction of the Muslim nation of Bosnia. In  occupied Palestine, Egypt, and Algeria, although they are  slaughtering the Muslims, unfortunately there is no sign of  condemnation of the regimes dependent on the aforementioned  countries. In Iran, however, when a few narcotics smugglers are  condemned to death, these international organizations scream to  high heaven.    He added: Since its inception, the United Nations has served  the goals of the Western world-devourers, and during the tenure  of Butrus-Ghali the credibility of this organization has  completely disappeared among the oppressed nations.    Mr. Butrus-Ghali, you will live in infamy for closing your  eyes this way to the slaughter of Muslims.    The speaker then discussed the Second Five-Year Plan. He  said: Although the government has tried to consider the views of  the exalted leader in the Plan Bill, the Majles deputies must  put these policies at the top of their agenda. They must create  work and expert groups until it is possible to approve the  aforementioned policies in the form of an organized and workable  plan.    Continuing, the deputy from Ardel discussed the paragraphs  in  the aforementioned plan. He said: It may be said with confidence  and certainty that the government was very successful under the  First Five-Year Plan in doing infrastructure work, but in my  view, although some work was done under the First Five-Year Plan  to privatize the government companies and reduce the size of the  government's administrative structure, the work was not done  quickly, and it did not produce change.    The very heavy vote by the deputies to consolidate the  ministries of industry is a part of the demand by the Majles  deputies to expedite administrative change, and God willing the  government leaders will work to move ahead faster on this  important matter.    He added: We want administrative structural reform on the  Majles agenda in the form of a bill. Since the relevant  organizations have taken no significant action since the  completion of the First Five-Year Plan, the Majles deputies are  obliged to present a bill on this matter. Clear and direct  planning must be done in the Second Five-Year Plan in such a way  that reform of the nation's administrative structure will  proceed more quickly, and that privatization will be achieved in  such a way that it is in the interest of the sacred government  of the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Yusefpur then emphasized: In the last year or two some  profiteering and opportunist individuals, with the support of  naive individuals, have undertaken to represent American  products, even as the Western nations are subjecting Iran to an  embargo on advanced industrial products and while in France,  which considers itself the cradle of freedoms in the West, they  will not tolerate head coverings on school girls and are  expelling them.    Then in revolution Iran a few profiteers and opportunists  and  a few naive people supporting them are permitting Coca-Cola, the  products from General Electric and those of several other  companies to be widely distributed. Gentlemen, don't you realize  that Coca-Cola is the symbol of America and that they are trying  to put up advertisements for this product on every street and in  every quarter? If the producers of this product are telling the  truth, why are they seeking only to produce and distribute  consumer goods? If there is no hidden agenda behind what they  are doing, if it is true as they say that their contract is with  Ireland, then let them produce this beverage with Iran's name.    Just as the heroic Hezbollah did not allow MacDonald's  sandwiches to be produced in Tehran, they will go to any lengths  to prevent the production of Coca-Cola and other American  products.    He discussed the provisions of the 1373 [21 March 1994-20  March 1995] budget designed to resist high prices for government  goods and services. He said: Unfortunately the Postal Company  has made excessive increases in the prices of postal products.  When the cost of mailing publications and books inside and  outside the country has increased tenfold, how can the cultural  institutions continue to operate?  <H5>  Fatemeh Homayun-Moqadam, Deputy From Tabriz </H5>   Unlike our country, in most of the European nations, women  staff employees have no security.    The next speaker was Ms. Homayuni-Moqadam [as published],  deputy from Tabriz. In her speech she said: In view of the  hostility of the imperialist nations towards Islam and divine  law, once again the Human Rights Commission has expressed  unacceptable views concerning the rights of women in Iran. In  general since the triumph of the Islamic revolution, women in  Iran have achieved full human dignity under the commands of  Islam, and this is unequaled in all the nations of the world.    She added: Statistics show that millions of girls are  studying in the elementary schools and high schools and that  hundreds of girl students and thousands of Iranian women are  studying and doing research at high specialist levels, and these  numbers are several times the figures prior to the revolution.  The growth of our women in specialist medical fields,  especially the women surgeons and midwives, is something to be  proud of. At the same time, in most countries women work as  nurses while male physicians treat women's ailments. To make up  for the shortcomings of the past, the Majles must require the  government to bring women physicians up to a sufficient level of  quality in the gynecological surgery fields, and it must also  require the Ministry of Health Care and Treatment to reserve at  least 25 percent of its admissions for assistants in the  surgery, neurology, urology, and other fields for women.    Ms. Moqadam then said: After the triumph of the Islamic  revolution, a small number of the women, who had no social base  because of not wearing the veil, served as slaves for  imperialist plans. Now however, millions of Iranian women are  involved in various political affairs.    While in some countries women's rights are one-half the  rights of men, in our country there is no such difference  between the rights of men and women in any office or factory.    In addition, women have special provisions to take time off  and they can even ask to serve half-time with an appropriate  salary.    In most of the European nations, women staff employees have  no security, but it can be said with confidence that in our  country no one feels insecure in any office.  <H5>  Hoseyn Amini, Deputy From Qa'enat </H5>   The important thing for the country to do to reduce its  economic problems is to increase production and reduce  consumption.    The next speaker was Amini, deputy from Qa'enat. During his  speech he said: The First Five-Year Plan is ending at a time  when economic and production projects have begun to move and  investment has been done.    Continuing, he then added: The addition of 16,000 hospital  beds and 6,000 health clinics; providing running water to more  than 5,310 rural areas; increasing the capacities of factories;  putting 80,000 new classes into operation and increasing the  number of university students at the journeyman level and higher  from 447,000 to 1.03 million; adding 5,200 megawatts to existing  power plant capacities and providing electrical power to more  than 6,000 rural areas; building 727 urban telephone centers,  adding more than 1.7 million telephone numbers, adding 3,420  rural telephone centers; and increasing the number of gas  service lines from 750,000 to 1.9 million. In agriculture,  increasing wheat production from 7 to 10.8 million tons; in  industry, annual increases of 39.6 percent for steel, 25.2  percent for copper, 16.6 percent for aluminum, 26.3 percent for  heavy vehicles, 30 percent for light vehicles, 28 percent for  road-building machinery, 42 percent for agricultural machinery,  11.4 percent for tires, 17.4 percent for vegetable shortening,  and 14.2 percent for other goods that there is no opportunity to  discuss, are some of the results of the First Five-Year Plan.  And it is necessary to praise and thank the president of the  republic, the toiling government and all the insiders and  executive officers.    Amini discussed the fact that one of the most important  tasks  for the Majles this year is to study and approve the Second  Five-Year Plan. He said: It is hoped that using the experiences  of the First Five-Year Plan and its strengths and weaknesses and  with a realistic view, steps will be taken to solve existing  problems, develop economic and cultural cooperation and  prosperity, and to strengthen and perpetuate the government's  political positions against foreigners.    Continuing, the speaker then discussed points that must be  considered while studying and approving the Second Five-Year  Plan. He said: These points include taking into account the  guidance from the exalted leader concerning social justice and  giving serious support to the oppressed classes, attention to  the problems of the people, especially those who have  sacrificed, preventing waste and extravagance in spending,  employment and alleviating deprivation, attention to  agriculture, policy making to improve quality, develop domestic  production and increase exports, supervision of the  implementation of programs, reinforcing the defense foundation,  and continuation of the foreign policy based on glory, wisdom  and interests.    In the same regard the speaker added: The important thing  for  the country to do to reduce its economic problems is to increase  production and reduce consumption. In setting the needed laws  and regulations in the Second Five-Year Plan, serious support  must be given to production, and the existing obstacles to  productive investment must be removed. A mechanism must be  chosen that will divert loose money from the service sector and  dependent and brokerage activity into production, and the  banking system must serve the production system more than it  does.    Concerning industry, he then added: The nation's industrial  strategy must be specified and the basic point must be accepted  that the most important issue is to make existing industries  sound. This restoration to soundness means creating circles of  communication between the domestic industrial sectors and  between industries, basic industries and production activities.    He discussed the fact that investment must be diverted for  several years to industries that are active producing raw  materials, intermediate materials and conversion materials, and,  to the extent possible, machinery and equipment for existing  industries. He said: We must estimate revenue sources  realistically, rather than in accordance with predetermined  expenses.    Amini discussed tax reform and reducing dependence on oil  revenues. He said: It is necessary to make basic changes in the  tax system in the Second Five-Year Plan. The tax system must be  made vigorous, effective, and in accordance with the goal of  social justice, in such a way that it will give direction to  economic activities. Instead of putting pressure on low-income  people and small businessmen, it can collect the government's  due from those who have enormous and sometimes inflated incomes.  Currently taxes are not appropriate for the incomes of  individuals, and those with huge incomes are shaking off the tax  burden in various ways.    The deputy from Qa'enat discussed the need for serious  attention to employment and preventing emigration, especially in  the deprived areas. He said: Consideration must be given to  expediting work in the education and training and research  sectors and to developing technical and professional training,  and the necessary attention must be given to the small  agricultural conversion industries.    In conclusion, he discussed the problems in his electoral  district. He issued memos concerning the distribution of  national and province credits to the Plan and Budget  Organization, to the Ministry of Petroleum concerning expediting  gas delivery in the south of Khorasan, to the Ministry of  Commerce concerning the purchase, packaging and export of  saffron and barberry, and to the Ministry of Agriculture  concerning the creation of a research station. He asked the  president of the republic to issue the necessary orders to help  the region's farmers, who have been hurt by the recent cold  weather.  <H5>  Mehdi Mehdizadeh, Deputy From Gonabad </H5>   Limited resources and the correct economic viewpoint dictate  that we economize on consumption.    The next speaker was Mehdizadeh, deputy from Gonabad. During  his speech he discussed the drought in large parts of our  country. He said: The deprived farmers in parts of Khorasan,  where irreparable losses have recently been incurred because of  the severe cold, whose orchards have been completely destroyed,  have increasing problems, and if their situation is not dealt  with soon and if their losses are not compensated, they will  abandon their homes and farms and go elsewhere.    The speaker then discussed the situation of the people of  Bosnia in the city of Gorazde. He said: This city, which has  been declared secure from Serb attacks, has come to this state  under UN supervision and with the direct cooperation of the  Russians and with the cooperation of so-called civilized Western  nations, including America. This is not the first time the  aggressor has shown a happy face. Such an approach has been  taken elsewhere before, including Palestine. We condemn these  crimes, and we hope the Muslims will learn from this situation  and awaken.    He said the Security Council should call the aggressor Serbs  to account for their war crimes. Continuing, he said: Our  country is in a good situation in terms of economic resources,  but they are being used improperly in most cases. In many cases,  not only have investments not been profitable in various  sectors, they have not even recovered the capital. In many  factories the abundance of various machines has filled up the  space, yet the level of their profitable utilization is quite  low. Most foreign specialists who have visited our factories are  surprised to see that a factory, and an advanced one at that,  produces simple products in limited numbers. He also said:  Limited resources and the correct economic viewpoint dictate  that we economize on consumption. It is clear that economizing  does not mean reducing the level and quality of life. With  proper economizing fewer resources are used, while the proper  quality is retained. Many economists consider the reason for  stagnation and inflation to be the low level of utilization.    Continuing, he said: Utilization means getting the most and  at the same time the best use possible from the usable elements  that have a role in the production of an item or the provision  of a service, and the utilization coefficient is an indicator of  this use. Today the economic growth of any society depends on  the rate of the growth of utilization in that society. In the  long run the importance of utilization in economic growth is  much greater than the participation of the elements of capital  and labor, and for this reason every country must try to make  progress in utilization, in order to be able to expand its  production with less consumption. This is the secret of success  for any country. It is necessary to note that the rate of  utilization in our country is low compared to that of other  countries in many areas, and this must be corrected.    The speaker then discussed the population increase and the  excessive use of natural resources. He said: The rapid  population growth in the last 35 years has always been ahead of  projects and plans, and it has disrupted their implementation  and progress. During this period the nation's population has  tripled, and it will reach 100 to 120 million in the next 25 to  30 years. Those 40 million new members of society will need 8  million homes, 1.5 million new educational units and many other  things. Already one person is born every 17 seconds. At this  rate, a new classroom will be needed every 15 minutes, every day  16 new schools will be needed, and every year 25,000 classrooms  will have to be built, yet the existing situation is very far  from what is desired.    He also added: Fighting excessive population growth demands  national and universal resolve; it is not the responsibility of  an organization or a ministry.    He discussed forests and pastures. He said: Every year in  our  country 1 million hectares of pasture becomes desert, so that  since the year 1341 [21 March 1962-20 March 1963] half our  forests and pastures have been destroyed, and this process  continues with the population increase and the lack of  sufficient attention.    Continuing, the speaker said: In our country, due to  insufficient precipitation and improper use of existing water  resources, water has become vital. Most of the canals and wells  have dried up due to the drop in water tables and many farms and  rural areas are being destroyed. Rivers and coastal areas have  become polluted, and due to the lack of plant cover, instead of  being a blessing, in many cases rainfall causes flooding which  destroys farms and towns.    Pressurized irrigation techniques, which produce a very high  yield compared to traditional methods, have not come into  general use, and in the cities excessive water use has created a  problem for agriculture. Water, which is obtained at high cost  using subsidies without being put to the best use, usually  evaporates or soaks into the ground after being contaminated  with chemicals and bacteria.    In addition to polluting the soil and converting  agricultural  land for residential use, population increases cause the  destruction and erosion of productive soil because of excessive  pressure on agricultural lands. In our country more than 1  percent of agricultural lands and about 1.5 to 2 million cubic  meters of soil is destroyed every year. The failure to prevent  soil erosion could bring us to a bad end such as the one in  Ethiopia, which has lost most of its productive soil. There,  even in years with heavy rainfall the people are unable to fill  their stomachs, and every year a large number of people die of  starvation.  <H5>  Asgari Faqih, Deputy From Qa'em Shahr </H5>   Asgari Faqih, deputy from Qa'em Shahr, was the final  preagenda speaker. During his speech he said: The role of the  masses in social change is a powerful and undeniable factor, but  that alone cannot bring about basic and fundamental change.  Other factors must be added to complete the role of the people.    He added: Our people, despite all the rancor and  mercilessness, have remained loyal to the shari'ah and the  leader, and they have held on to this loyalty at the cost of  their lives. They have faced one problem after another, but they  have not bowed down and they have not surrendered to domination  by the wicked who rule the world.    He also added: This strong relationship and the cooperation  between the people, religion and their leader, is highly sacred  because of its vital role in reviving and preserving genuine  human qualities and its conformity with pure human essence and  orthodox religion.    Continuing, he thanked the people of the province of  Mazandaran for taking part in the funeral rites for 110 martyrs.  He said: The call for obedience to the leader and continuing on  the path of the martyrs and the cry of death to America and  Zionism rang out in the sky of the area, and during these days  the people said farewell to their martyrs.    He then thanked the Karbala 25 Army and the Martyr  Foundation  for holding the funeral rites for the martyrs. He asked the  president of the republic for help and cooperation to carry out  basic projects and employ the area's material and spiritual  capabilities, and he asked the minister of roads and  transportation to convert the Tehran-Firuzkuh-Qa'em Shahr road  to the North Tehran highway.    In conclusion, the deputy from Qa'em Shahr asked the  relevant  officials to expand and rebuild Mazandaran's textile factories,  to develop the activities of the Central Alborz Rock Coal  Factory, to create war and conversion industry factories, to  remove the obstacles to the building of industrial villages and  to create textile and mining colleges.  <H5>  Legislation </H5>   The first item on the agenda at yesterday's open Majles  session was the report from the second consultation of the  Judicial and Legislative affairs commission concerning the Bill  To Form General and Revolutionary Courts (General Courts), whose  full details were approved by the deputies in 37 articles.

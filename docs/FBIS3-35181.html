The attack took place  as she was traveling with her husband and two children near the  village of Qarawat Bani-Hasan west of Ari'el. Two bursts of  fire were directed from a stationary vehicle. The woman, whose  name has not yet been released, was hit in the head. Her  husband did not stop the car, and rushed to a nearby Army base,  from where she was evacuated by ambulance to Beilinson Hospital  in Petah Tiqva. She died soon after. Our reporter says she was  in the fifth month of pregnancy.    At the site of the attack, the casings of Kalashnikov  bullets  were found. The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] has imposed a  curfew on the area, and a hunt is on for the terrorists.</p>

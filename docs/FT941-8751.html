			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Incentives call for merchant shipping The government was yesterday urged to provide fiscal incentives to halt the decline in Britain's merchant fleet by Mr Donald Anderson, a Labour defence spokesman. In the Commons he was joined by Sir Nicholas Bonsor, Conservative MP for Upminster and chairman of the cross-party defence committee, in doubting whether enough merchant ships would be available to support a task force similar to that mounted for the Falklands war in 1982. Mr Anderson said fiscal incentives would help to ensure that Britain retained a 'core' of merchant ships capable of meeting the requirements of the the ministry of defence in any emergency. Sir Nicholas said the government had rejected a suggestion by the British Chamber of Shipping that a random test should be carried out this year to establish the number of British and foreign merchant ships available for charter by the ministry of defence.</p>

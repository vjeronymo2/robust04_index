			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / Jump in net lending to consumers Net lending to consumers rose to record levels in August, after a small fall in credit levels in the previous month, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday, Gillian Tett writes. Total lending to consumers through non-mortgage building society loans, finance houses and credit cards covered by the Visa and Mastercard system rose to Pounds 632m, from the previous month's Pounds 349m. Measured on a three monthly basis - a figure regarded as a better guide to the underlying trend - total consumer lending was Pounds 1.58bn in the three months to August, up from Pounds 1.15bn in the previous three months. The CSO said that the rise in the level of consumer credit reflected the underlying upward trend in lending seen since the start of the year. Higher net lending by finance houses, which provide finance for cars, store cards and 'in-house' store credit, accounted for the biggest part of the rise. Net lending by this sector rose to Pounds 486m in August, from Pounds 324m in July. New lending by finance houses rose to Pounds 2bn in August, up from Pounds 1.91bn in the previous month. New lending in the three months to August was 2.3 per cent higher than in the previous three months. Lending on credit cards also rose in the month, following a significant repayment by consumers in July. Net lending on credit cards rose to Pounds 125m in August, compared with Pounds 18m in July. New lending on cards rose to Pounds 3bn in the month - up 2 per cent on the previous three months.</p>

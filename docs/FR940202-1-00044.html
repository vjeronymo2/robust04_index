			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service carefully has assessed the best scientific and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial information available regarding the past, present, and future  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threats faced by the California red-legged frog in determining to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> propose this rule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list the California red-legged frog ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Rana aurora draytonii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endangered. This subspecies has been extirpated from 75 percent of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> former range. Seventy-seven percent of remaining aggregations currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are threatened by one or more factors, including (1) introduction of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exotic predators and competitors, (2) urban encroachment, (3) construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of large and small reservoirs, water diversions and well development, (4)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flood control maintenance, (5) grazing, and (6) timber harvest. Only 44  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> drainages, with the majority being in Monterey, Santa Barbara, and San  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Luis Obispo Counties, currently provide habitat free from the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threats. Fragmentation of habitat, however, renders these populations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vulnerable to random extinction (stochastic) events. For the reasons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed below, critical habitat is not being proposed at this time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Critical Habitat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, and implementing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations (50 CFR 424.12) require that, to the maximum extent prudent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at the time a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California red-legged frog.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Species'' section, the California red-legged frog has been and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continues to be threatened by taking, an activity difficult to control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Listing of the frog may result in an increase in the threat of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vandalism, a concern expressed by the petitioners and other experts (M.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jennings, S, Sweet, pers. comms., 1993). California red-legged frogs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur in isolated and fragmented wetland habitat on private property and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are at risk from vandalism. Publication of specific localities, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be required in proposing critical habitat, would reveal precise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> locality data and thereby make the species more vulnerable to collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and acts of vandalism, and increase the difficulties of enforcement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protection of this species' habitat will be addressed in the recovery  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process and through the section 7 consultation process. Therefore, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not now be prudent to determine critical habitat of the California  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> red-legged frog.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Available Conservation Measures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, and individuals. The Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires that recovery actions be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> carried out for all listed species. The protection required of Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies and the prohibitions against taking and harm are discussed, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> part, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jeopardize the continued existence of such a species or to destroy or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must enter into formal consultation with the Service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies that may be involved as a result of this proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule are the Bureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Land Management, National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park Service, Forest Service, and the Departments of the Army, Navy and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Air Force. At several parks, the National Park Service has conducted or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is planning to conduct surveys of California red-legged frogs on park  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property (Daphne A. Hatch, National Park Service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1993; James  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sleznick, National Park Service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> in litt., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1992; Gary Fellers, National  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Park Service, pers. comm., 1993). The Forest Service has conducted and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has ongoing amphibian surveys in many National Forests within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> historic range of the California red-legged frog (J. Stephenson, pers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comm., 1993; D. Martin, pers. comm., 1993). The Bureau of Reclamation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is cosponsoring a proposed reservoir construction project (Los Vaqueros  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reservoir) on Kellogg Creek, Contra Costa County (Contra Costa Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District 1993). A mitigation and monitoring program is proposed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compensate for California red-legged frog habitat losses. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mitigation plan includes a bullfrog and exotic fish control program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be carried out for the life of the reservoir project (Contra Costa Water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> District 1993). The potential for success of the mitigation plan is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unknown. The proposed Los Banos Grande reservoir project on Los Banos  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Creek in Merced County, also cosponsored by the Bureau of Reclamation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not provide mitigation specifically for the California red-legged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frog (Cay Goude, Fish and Wildlife Service, pers. comm., 1993). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would be involved through their permitting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authority under section 404 of the Clean Water Act. Any of the above  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mentioned Federal agencies would be required to consult with the Service  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> if any action they fund, authorize, or carry out is likely to jeopardize  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continued existence of the California red-legged frog.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

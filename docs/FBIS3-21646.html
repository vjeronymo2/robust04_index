This statement was made on 10 February by the UN expert on  drug affairs and agricultural development, Iban de Rementeria,  who said the change in the anti-drug strategy announced on 9  February by U.S. President Bill Clinton represents a "complete  change in U.S. anti-drug policy."    De Rementeria said: "Since 1904 the United States has  maintained that drugs are a foreign problem. This is the first  time they have admitted it is a domestic problem. This is a  step forward because they admit that it is a health and  educational problem and not just a police issue."    The UN official believes this change of attitude regarding  the drug problem was promoted by the failure of the U.S.  administration's anti-drug policy, which during the past few  years cost more than $10 billion per year.    "Drug consumption in the United States has really not  dropped. During the past six years the number of consumers has  remained more or less the same," he said as he commented that it  is estimated there are 10 million cocaine and marijuana addicts  in the United States.    In referring to Clinton's new strategy, de Rementeria said:  "We must not have illusions because we remain alone in this  field."    From his viewpoint, the importance of reducing or  substituting coca crops has become a secondary issue.    De Rementeria added: "I do not see how we can plan an  alternative development program with the current international  agricultural policies if the GATT Uruguay Round has  institutionalized subsidies in developed countries and this  condemns agriculture in the Third World to failure."</p>

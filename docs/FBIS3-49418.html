			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The traditional New Year reception given by  President Dr. Zhelev for the diplomatic corps took place at the  Boyana Residence today.    In greeting the diplomats, Dr. Zhelev expressed his  confidence that, as in the past, also in 1994, their benevolence  and good intentions toward Bulgaria are likely to contribute to  our country's efforts for international support. Bulgarian  democracy has reached the middle of its first seven years and is  still expected to accomplish a great deal, but the path of  changes that Bulgaria embarked upon four years ago is  irreversible, the president assured his audience.    Mr. Zhelev recalled the essence of Bulgaria's international  policy and its Balkan policy in particular, which is aimed at  building lasting good neighborly and mutually advantageous  relations.    Dwelling on the forthcoming summit meeting of the NATO  member-states scheduled for 10 January 1994, the Bulgarian head  of state pointed out our country's stand of principle, according  to which it is striving to join NATO after the North Atlantic  bloc has, possibly, decided to expand.</p>

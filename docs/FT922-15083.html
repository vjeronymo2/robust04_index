			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Trade News: Dunkel confirms missed deadline THE Easter deadline to complete the Uruguay Round of talks on world trade liberalisation will be missed, Mr Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), confirmed yesterday. He argued that the negotiations, which began in 1986, were 'past the point of no return.' He insisted the trade reforms would be prominent on the agenda of the Group of Seven summit in Munich in June if no settlement had been reached by then. The Easter deadline, set in December when he released a 400-page draft Uruguay Round agreement, is the latest of many to be missed. Mr Dunkel referred to a 'growing sense of frustration and urgency' among negotiators in Geneva as differences over farm trade reform have put the entire agreement in jeopardy. After the Easter deadline the US no longer has enough legislative days left in its Congressional calendar to win approval for the agreement ahead of presidential elections in November. Speaking in Paris at a conference on world trade and investment organised by the International Chamber of Commerce and the International Herald Tribune, Mr Dunkel said that in spite of failure to reach agreement, each deadline 'had produced some results.' 'It is a very difficult, painful and complicated stage. Negotiations are still moving forwards. We are not blocked.' Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who had talks with President Bush in Washington two weeks ago in an effort to pave the way to a Uruguay Round agreement, will be host to the Munich summit, and has made it clear he wants the agreement settled before then. Negotiators are now confident that necessary compromises are possible in all areas under negotiation - including services and market access - except farm trade. US officials, who also speak in this context for many farm product exporters in the third world, insist that the European Community must make cuts to the volume of subsidised exports dumped on world markets.</p>

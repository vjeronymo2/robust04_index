			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / Brussels to ease steel cuts with Ecu900m EUROPEAN STEELMAKERS are to receive Ecu900m (Pounds 732m) of EC funding between 1993 and 1995 as part of a special aid plan agreed yesterday by the European Commission. The aid will contribute to the cost of restructuring in the industry and ease decisions on capacity cuts. The Commission has also pledged to clamp down on cheap imports from east and central European countries with which the EC has signed trade deals. Mr Martin Bangemann, EC industry commissioner, said: 'We are prepared to allow products produced in these countries on to our markets, but at the same time it has been clearly stated that fair conditions should be applied.' He said the EC would begin talks, particularly with Czechoslovakia and Poland, on possible 'additional measures' to curb cheap imports and avoid the EC having to impose anti-dumping duties. Commission trade officials have suggested that east and central European governments might be asked to impose taxes on steel exports. Half the Ecu900m should come from the resources of the European coal and steel treaty and EC structural funds. Some Ecu240m will be allocated to the cost of shedding up to 50,000 steel jobs, and Ecu210m has been committed for plant closures and rationalisation. Under the treaty, the 12 EC member states must match that central contribution. European steelmakers, hit by recession, overcapacity and cheap non-EC imports, asked the Commission a month ago for political, financial and commercial help in return for big capacity cuts. They estimated the overall cost of their plans at as much as Ecu4bn. Mr Fernand Braun, the Luxembourger who used to head the Commission's industry directorate, has been asked to consult individual steel companies about capacity cuts and prepare a report. The aim is to avoid anti-competitive collaboration bet-ween steelmakers to cut capacity. The aid plan, together with the controversial short-term question of how to react to planned state aid for the Spanish steel sector, will be discussed at next Tuesday's meeting of EC industry ministers in Brussels. Anthony Robinson, East Europe Editor, writes: Central European steel tube producers have reacted angrily to the Commission's decision to impose anti-dumping duties of up to 30.4 per cent on seamless tube imports from Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland and Croatia. Mr Vladimir Petr, director of the steel division of the Czech ministry of industry, contested the EC figures and argued that the case for dumping was 'not proven'.</p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Denmark (7): Pooling everyone's ideas - A Japanese technique is helping companies improve productivity 'Continuous improvement' - productivity-improving techniques based on the Japanese Kaizen principle - is increasingly popular in Danish industry. 'In other countries, continuous improvement is practised by some of the large and well-known companies. What is exceptional about Denmark is that it is being practised throughout industry,' said Mr Per Bronsholt Nielsen, consultant at the Federation of Danish Industries, where he has helped to introduce continuous improvement techniques to a network of 150 Jutland companies, which is one of four regional groups working with the techniques. The starting point was a study-tour to Japan by a group of Danish industrialists in 1987. They visited a selection of the best Japanese companies, to examine some of the factors which made them masters of productivity development. The tour resulted in a book, and in the successful adoption of some of the techniques which had been learned at a handful of companies, but only in the past two years has the movement caught on. 'We think we have developed something unique by combining the culture of the Danish firm with organisational development and management tools,' said Mr Nielsen. 'We have concluded that you cannot make the tools ('just-in-time' or quality circles, for example) work without taking the culture of the company into account.' Kaizen, as adapted to Danish requirements, is called 'employee activated production development'. The basic aim is to involve everyone in the firm, from the management down to the shop floor, in a process of improving productivity by making things work more smoothly and efficiently. The results have been generally good, in some cases spectacular. One company achieved a 50 per cent productivity improvement over a period of 18 months. Many companies report productivity increases of 10 to 20 per cent. 'What has surprised me and many others is that the improvements in productivity in firms which have been using the technique for several years are achieved year after year,' said Mr Nielsen. Using common sense to eliminate errors or inefficiencies in the production system is one way of describing the intentions of the programme. It works when everyone in the company contributes, both by pointing to the problems and by suggesting solutions. It has caught on so spectacularly in Denmark, Mr Nielsen thinks, because of an existing culture of co-operation between the management and the workforce in Danish industry, at both industry and company level. Danish labour relations are regulated by law, but legislation is rarely imposed unless with the joint agreement of the employers and the trade unions; and almost everyone - the companies and their employees - is a member of either an employer association or a trade union. 'At company level, it is part of the culture that we talk things over. Labour conflicts are rare,' said Mr Nielsen. 'We also have a generally high level of education among the employees, and they are not afraid of raising questions about the way things are done, especially not the younger generation.' When the idea of employee-activated production development is being launched by a company, it is common for a consultant from the Federation of Danish Industries to join a consultant from the Metal Workers' Union in explaining to employees what the idea is all about. 'If we can convince the workforce that this process helps to improve working conditions for employees as well as productivity, that jobs become more interesting and the employee's influence is increased, then everyone is happy,' said Mr Nielsen. The movement had spread fast through networking - another process which works well in Denmark, because companies listen and pass on their own experiences, so that colleagues, and even competitors, can learn, he added. The Federation of Industries started the process by bringing together a small group of companies, whose managements met to discuss their experiences several times a year. When the news is good, it spreads rapidly and more companies want to hear how they can benefit from the process.</p>

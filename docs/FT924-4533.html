			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Key US data point to steady recovery FEDERAL and private sector organisations in the US yesterday reported more evidence of sustained growth in the economy, with leading indicators and the purchasing managers' index showing upturns. The Commerce Department said its index of leading indicators, a composite of 11 statistics designed to predict the overall trend of economic activity, rose by 0.4 per cent in October. It was helped mostly by lower claims for unemployment insurance and higher manufacturers' order books. At the same time the National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) said its November index rose to 55.0 per cent, compared with 50.6 per cent in October. An index reading above 50 per cent indicates that the manufacturing sector is expanding. 'Vigorous growth significantly slowed the decline in employment in the manufacturing sector, while inflation was kept at bay. With inventories at a very low level and new orders at a high level, the renewed growth could well spill over into December,' said Mr Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM's business survey committee. The statistics were slightly stronger than financial market economists had predicted, reinforcing the prospect that the US economy might now be on its way to sustained growth. However, few economists believe that the underlying rate of US growth is anywhere near the annualised rate of 3.9 per cent reported for the third quarter by the Commerce Department last week. Until now, growth has not spilled over into the jobs market and economists are watching closely to see if Friday's employment report confirms the impression of a stronger economy. President-elect Bill Clinton said last week the stronger growth might affect his short-term judgment on the need for fiscal stimulus, but his economic advisers say that he does not want to lock himself into any plan until it is clearer where the economy stands.

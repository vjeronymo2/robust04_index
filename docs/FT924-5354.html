			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / De Klerk sets out democracy timetable SOUTH AFRICAN President F W de Klerk yesterday spelt out his government's timetable for a transition to multi-racial democracy, saying he expected all-race elections to take place by April 1994, with an interim government of national unity in place by the end of that year. However, he issued a veiled threat that, if this timetable could not be achieved through multi-party negotiation, 'other ways will have to be found to bring about a government of national unity'. The African National Congress, the biggest opposition party, said 17 months was too long to wait for an end to white rule. 'South Africa cannot afford any delay,' an ANC statement said. 'The economy cannot sustain a further year of corruption and mismanagement, the people will no longer tolerate lack of governance or the increasing uncertainty that will clearly be accompanied by escalating violence, growing unemployment and deteriorating socio-economic conditions.' Mr de Klerk gave no details. But South Africa's constitution calls for a general election by late 1994. He has often said he would never hold another whites-only election, leaving him little option but to try to co-opt moderate blacks into his cabinet if negotiation fails. He said the timetable involved the completion by February of the current bilateral constitutional talks with leading parties with a multi-party negotiating forum to convene by March and agree an interim constitution by the end of May. Mr de Klerk added that township violence which has killed more than 7,000 blacks in less than three years had to be curbed. 'By this time next year, if the violence has not abated, we will be faced by a totally different situation that will make this timetable irrelevant,' he said. Asked about control of the security forces in the lead up to elections, de Klerk said a transitional executive council representing all parties would ensure 'a level playing field'.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Anatoliy Zlenko, Ukraine's minister of foreign  affairs, who has been on official visits to Iran, India, and  Vietnam, returned to Kiev on 24 April. Replying to journalists'  questions, he said in particular that the development of  relations with countries of the Asia-Pacific region fully  corresponds to Ukraine's foreign policy concept. The realities  of life in our state, he said, nudge us toward searching for new  partners, who have already accumulated a great deal of  experience in various fields. In the opinion of Anatoliy  Zlenko, on the one hand this experience would be extremely  useful in the implementation of reforms in Ukraine, and on the  other hand it would be useful in the practical resolution of  economic problems. We would like to see advantageous partners  in the countries of the Asian region, who are currently also  looking for a way in to new markets, the minister noted.    On the way to Kiev Anatoliy Zlenko stopped in Ashgabat,  where  he met the leaders of Turkmenistan's cabinet of ministers. The  discussions centered on the development of bilateral relations,  particularly in the economic field.</p>

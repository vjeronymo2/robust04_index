			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Finance Minister Mikalay Lisay held a  meeting with representatives of Belarusian commercial banks.  The participants in the meeting discussed the implementation of  the Supreme Soviet Presidium resolution on allocating 400  billion rubles in credit to the government by commercial banks.  There are reasons to believe that the above-mentioned  resolution was met by commercial banks without enthusiasm. Some  bankers fear that the allocated money can be used for holding an  election campaign by one of the candidates. Representatives of  several banks expressed their willingness to allocate credits,  but the total sum is very small -- less than 10 billion. It is  expected that the rest of the banks will present their proposals  regarding this issue on 8 June.</p>

			<p>940623 FT  23 JUN 94 / Russia warns Nato on allies: Moscow signs landmark Partnership for Peace Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, yesterday urged Nato not to risk provoking public opinion in his country by rushing to welcome east European countries as members of the alliance. The appeal was made during a visit to Brussels for a Nato meeting hailed as a landmark in Russia's links with the west. Representatives of Nato's 16 member states were gathered to honour Russia as the 21st, and most important, member of Partnership for Peace, the military co-operation programme. The partnership is intended to broaden military co-operation in Europe and the former Soviet republics, setting up programmes for joint peacekeeping exercises and grooming countries for eventual Nato membership. Mr Kozyrev told Nato many Russians needed convincing that the alliance was not intent on a 'triumphant march eastwards'. The Russian minister said a 'major psychological adjustment' would be necessary before his fellow citizens could accept the idea of countries like Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joining the alliance. In welcoming the Russian participation, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said that 'by widening the reach of the great post-war security and economic institutions, we can help ensure that war, poverty and oppression never again engulf this continent'. Mr Kozyrev shelved demands that Nato be subsumed by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, a loose club of 53 nations whose current brief is more diplomatic than military, and said time would tell which was the most important institution. 'Experience will show the correct combination and determine the real value of each of them,' Mr Kozyrev said. As well as signing up to the partnership, Mr Kozyrev and his hosts approved a separate document that will usher in a broader relationship between Russia and Nato, including a dialogue on European security issues. But allowing Russia to negotiate this side agreement before joining the partnership has dismayed central and east European states, who were told they must adhere to PFP first and then refine their links with NATO. Nato said it was satisfied that the document's final text did not give Moscow any automatic right to sit in on their private discussions. Diplomats said that in four days of haggling over the text, Russia showed goodwill by agreeing to work from a Western draft but it won some important concessions. One was the exclusion of a phrase that would pledge Russia and Nato not to interfere in each other's decision-making process. Another was the inclusion of a reference to Russia's importance as a nuclear power.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] It has been discovered that relations between the  Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] and Athens have been strained by  reports that the PKK has taken armed action against several  targets in Greece and south Cyprus. Reports that Theofilos  Yeoryiadhis, a PKK agent in south Cyprus who was recently  murdered [see 28 March Terrorism Report], was shot and killed by  PKK militants and not by the Turkish Intelligence Organization  have prompted Greek officials to change the direction of their  investigation.    It is believed that Yeoryiadhis, who described himself as an  enemy of the Turks and has acted as the PKK contact in south  Cyprus since 1979, split from that organization two months ago.  He was killed by PKK militants, who secretly arrived in south  Cyprus, for failing to heed the PKK's threats.    Meanwhile, the PKK reportedly sabotaged the tourist ship  Athina- Palace in the Port of Piraievs last week. The ship was  destroyed by fire. The cause of the incident has not yet been  established. The ship was scheduled to leave Greece for Izmir  and Kusadasi after calling at several Greek islands in the  Aegean Sea the day after it was destroyed by fire. It has been  claimed that the PKK decided to prevent Greek passenger ships  from visiting Turkey and placed an incendiary bomb in the  Athina-Palace. The explosive was to detonate when the ship  entered the Port of Izmir. However, it detonated prematurely  and the ship was destroyed by fire in Greece.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Chisinau, ROMPRES, 11/4/1994 -- President Snegur  has met this afternoon with members of the Parliamentary  Commission for settling the problem of insuring the conditions  for performing the deputy duties by Ilie Ilascu and releasing  the other detainees of the so-called "Ilascu group," states a  Presidential Press Service communique. Snegur said during the  meeting that he met Saturday [9 April] with Igor Smirnov to  discuss in particular the fate of the political detainees.  According to the President, only unusual solutions could lead  to a breakthrough in this problem. According to him the problem  is in the center of the public attention, because "things went  too far." Snegur mentioned that he will do everything possible  to release the patriots. But he was also "confused with the  fact that the weekly TARA [the country], Christian Democratic  Popular Front of Moldova publication, often aggravated the  situation by publishing articles that oppose the pursued  objectives." President Snegur appraised that the problem could  be settled "only by means of reasonable compromises and  expressed his hope that all progressive forces will realize this  fact," concluded the communique.</p>

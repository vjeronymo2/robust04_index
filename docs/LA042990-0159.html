			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PINMANSHIP  </P> <P> When it comes to expressing individual style, lapel pins offer a rare  opportunity to stand out from the crowd.  </P> <P> Like bumper stickers, they say something about the owner. Unlike rings or  bracelets, they don't get in the way of office machines. Lapel pins by artists,  for women and men, are becoming as collectible as paintings. It's a way to have  your art and wear it too. BARBARA THORNBURG  </P></p>

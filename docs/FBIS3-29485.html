[passage omitted]    Observers said the Cabinet move was seen as an attempt to  prevent top brass, who traditionally ink the deals, from  receiving kickbacks worth millions of baht or much more.    Chuan was less than totally clear about what he had in mind.  But apparently aware of dissatisfaction among the top brass, he  said the barter system would be employed on a case-by-case  basis. "It is not mandatory," the prime minister insisted. But  Chuan has seemed to be trying to distance himself from his vague  "case-by-case" purchase policy. The issue became more ambiguous  when he said the food-for-arms plan was not his own idea but  that of former Navy Chief Adm Wichet Karunyawanit. [passage  omitted]    Tension escalated after the Cabinet insisted that the Air  Force's plan to buy six G222 transport planes from Italy, a  Bt3.42 billion purchase, would not fall in the "not mandatory"  category as defined by Chuan. "The Defence Ministry must  cooperate with the agriculture, the foreign and the commerce  ministries to persuade Italy to buy Thai goods in return,"  stated a Cabinet resolution.    The Air Force is determined to get the new aircraft, saying  its present fleet of C123 transporters has been in commission  for more than 30 years. "They (old model planes) should be  decommissioned," an Air Force official, who asked not to be  identified, said.    He said an Italian firm has already agreed to waive about  Bt41 million in training fees in order to help Thailand close  the deal. "I really don't see a way-out at the moment. I can't  see how Italy could possibly agree with our proposal in its  present form. I mean, what kind of agricultural produce do the  Italians need from Thailand," the source said. He said he did  not understand why the government had made the decision despite  observations from officers that it would be difficult to  negotiate a deal. "How can we, the military, negotiate the deal?  It's impossible. We can't do it. Our only hope resides with the  Commerce Ministry. But I really don't see the Italians giving it  the nod," he commented. He also questioned the motives behind  the resolution.    Commander of the Air Force Siriphong Thongyai reacted calmly  towards the decision by saying "it is natural if there are other  conditions to think about it (before buying the planes)."</p>

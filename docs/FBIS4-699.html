			<p>BFN     [Text] The speaker of the National Assembly, Dr. J.T.  Kolane, this morning adjourned the house until tomorrow after he  informed the members that some members of parliament had been  abducted by armed soldiers. Dr. Kolane said he was of the  opinion that the members could not concentrate on debates under  these circumstances. The speaker said he was disappointed by  these despicable acts. Although the speaker did not mention the  names of the members concerned, it is believed that they are the  deputy prime minister, the Honorable Selometsi Baholo; the  honorable minister of justice, Mr. Kelebone Maope; the minister  of trade and industry, the Honorable Shakhane Mokhehle; the  minister of education, the Honorable Pakalitha Mosisili; and the  minister of natural resources, the Honorable Monyane Moleleki.

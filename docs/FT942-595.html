			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses show resilience after morning setback After Friday afternoon's slide in New York, more pressure on the dollar and the fall of another Japanese government, bourses were ready for another setback yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff; but some of them were surprised by their own resilience. FRANKFURT, initially, fell with the rest and the Dax index closed 16.71 lower at 1,988.60 after a session's low of 1,968.61. However, the September bund future recovered from a low of 91.23 to a high of 92.42, and seemed to be holding the 92 level at the end of the equity post-bourse, when the Ibis indicated Dax showed a further recovery at 2,000.48. Behind this, and reflecting the swing in the market's mood, was the performance of Deutsche Bank. During the session Bayernverein and Dresdner offered some relief from this year's consistent weakness in the sector, rising DM7.50 to DM433, and DM6.50 to DM364.50 respectively. But Deutsche was measuring Friday's downgrade by Merrill Lynch in New York against a reaffirmed buy recommendation yesterday from Morgan Stanley in London, the latter backed up by B Metzler in Frankfurt. German's biggest bank hit a new 1994 low of DM659 before closing the session down DM3.80 at DM666, and recovering to DM673.40 at the end of the day. Turnover eased from DM7bn to DM6.9bn. Outside the banking sector, there was a buyer for Volkswagen which saw the shares up DM2.80 to DM467.80 on the session, and after a rise in five-month car deliveries. VW rose another DM5.20 to DM473 after hours. PARIS remained volatile, the CAC-40 index moving in a range between 1,870 and 1,920 before closing the day slightly higher, up 4.58 at 1,911.60. Turnover was firm at FFr3.7bn. The turnround in performance was directly related to the stronger than expected opening on Wall Street as well as firmness in the bond market. Beyond the current turmoil in the financial markets, there was good news on the horizon as an association of French analysts said that they had produced a further upward revision of their outlook for company results this year. Rhone-Poulenc saw heavy trading and the shares dropped to a session low of FFr113.80, before closing off FFr3.80 or 3.2 per cent at FFr114.70 in further reaction to disappointing earnings news last week from its US subsidiary, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer. The US company, subsequently, was the object of a number of brokers' downgrades. Suez dipped FFr1.40 to FFr266.50 as the group noted that it might increase its stake in Lyonnaise-Dumez, up FFr15 to FFr515, to 20 per cent. AMSTERDAM was lifted off its session lows by the improvement late in the session on Wall Street, the AEX index closing off 4.3 or 1.1 per cent at 377.10, having tested the 374 level earlier in the day. Aside from outside influences the market was also affected by the failure of talks aimed at securing a workable coalition government following the inconclusive general election result on May 3. Reed Elsevier suffered at the opening from the unexpected resignation of the co-chairman of the UK/Dutch group, the shares easing to Fl 145 before picking up later to close down Fl 1.80 at Fl 150.20. MILAN was again lower in thin volume as foreign investors continued selectively to take profits and domestic funds remained inactive. The Comit index fell 4.91 to 694.01, with some analysts predicting that the market would fall to the 650-660 level before it rebounded. Industrial blue chips were mostly lower, in line with the market, but Fiat was L60 or 0.9 per cent down at L6,345. The insurance sector was harder hit, led by a L1,215 or 2.9 per cent fall to L40,866 by Generali. One dealer noted that the slide came in the wake of weekend details that premium income rose more slowly than expected in the first five months of the year. He added that the sector was also being hurt by worries that the companies' portfolios would be badly hit by losses in the bond markets. RAS fell L790 to L25,500 and SAI was L482 down at L20,648. Fondiaria dropped L545 or 4.1 per cent to L12,805 as it warned that it might have to launch a capital increase if it was to buy back the 20 per cent stake held by Groupama, and which the French group has said it planned to sell. ZURICH picked up from its lows as Wall Street opened firmer after a day in which futures related trading made for volatile conditions. The SMI index finished 15.8 easier at 2,561.4, after a day's low of 2,525.5, in thin turnover. UBS bearers picked up SFr12 to SFr1,145 amid futures related buying, but renewed demand emerged for some insurers. Zurich rose SFr10 to SFr1,300 and Winterthur gained SFr16 to SFr705. Chemicals were out of favour with Ciba losing SFr35 or 4.3 per cent to SFr770 and Roche certificates down SFr65 to SFr6,245. MADRID's general index eased 0.97 to 298.17 after a day's, and year's low of 295.50. Turnover was thin at Pta22.29bn. In one of the worst performances of the day, Union y Fenix fell Pta120, or 7 per cent to Pta1,520 on shareholder approval of the reverse takeover of the insurer by the French company, AGF. Among the better performers, Amper rose Pta12 to Pta770 after Pta798 following Friday's sale of a lossmaking electronics subsidiary. WARSAW rebounded from the year's lows in thin volume as investors, encouraged by revived demand during the previous session, held back from making further sales. The Wig index rose 463.1 or 6.4 per cent to 7,678.3.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ibrahim Ghawshah, official spokesman for </F> Hamas, by Samir al-Hijjawi, "following the Israeli threats  against Jordan;" place and date not given]    [Excerpts] [Al-Hijjawi] What is the position and  viewpoint of Hamas regarding the PLO-Israeli agreements signed  in Paris and Cairo?    [Ghawshah] At a first reading, these agreements, which were  carried by the media, are amazing. In the past, the [Oslo]  PLO-Israeli agreement was opposed for basic and principled  reasons. One who is conscientious or patriotic, or one who  loves his people will be amazed when he reads this agreement.  This is because the agreement gives a complete and perpetual  mortgage to Zionist occupation. I want to emphasize three  points regarding the gravity of this agreement:    1. This agreement relinquishes both the land of Palestine  and the Palestinian people's rights to the lands of their  fathers and forefathers.    2. This agreement forces all factions of the Palestinian  people into standing on the same slippery road, and places them  face to face with one another, so the Jewish occupier can look  at them and laugh, exactly as the merchant of Venice, the Jewish  Shylock, laughed.    3. This is a false peace. Everything in it is a lie. The  hypocritical world blessed the Palestinian and Zionist parties  to this agreement. In fact, there is only one party, the  Zionist party, which, as Peres said, has no other party to  negotiate with. [passage omitted]    [Al-Hijjawi] There is talk about releasing detainees who  support these agreements, after they sign pledges not to resort  to violence and resistance, and also about excluding detainees  who oppose the agreements, including Hamas detainees. What is  your view in this regard?    [Ghawshah] This is another tragedy. Regrettably, the  Palestinian negotiating delegation, blessed by the Tunis  leadership, distributed a pledge among all administrative  detainees, so they would sign it, disavow the so-called violence  and terrorism, and accept the Oslo agreement.    There are many signs showing that this took place with the  knowledge and approval of the Palestinian side. This, in  itself, is a tragedy and a crime committed against the issue of  prisoners and detainees. The decisions made by the Tunis group  cannot be made by an armed Arab Palestinian group. The  decisions of this group are almost the same as those of the  Zionist enemy. This explains the current state of amazement,  frustration, and despair our Palestinian people in the occupied  territories are experiencing. [passage omitted]    [Al-Hijjawi] Preparations have begun for the entry of a  number of Palestinian policemen [into Gaza and Jericho]. How  will Hamas deal with these policemen?    [Ghawshah] The police issue is one of the dangerous mines  planted among the Palestinian people. Undoubtedly, Rabin and  Peres will laugh too much and exchange toasts when the last  Zionist soldier leaves Gaza, because they know that they have  put the Palestinian people face to face with each other, and put  the Palestinian policemen and 'Arafat's men face to face with  the Palestinian opposition, particularly Hamas. This serious  image cannot be disregarded by any sincere person. We beseech  God not to fulfill the Zionist planners' objectives and  aspirations. The Hamas Movement has already said it will not  attack the Palestinian police, if this police force carried out  its duties of protecting its people. However, the situation  will be very serious if this police force tries to chase the  mujahidin and to prevent them from carrying out the duty of  jihad, which is decreed by God. So, shall the mujahid respond  to God's orders, or to this policeman who is executing Rabin's  instructions?    [Al-Hijjawi] How you will act if the police force receives  orders to fire at your men?    [Ghawshah] I cannot determine exactly how Hamas will deal  with future developments, because the circumstance and the event  itself will determine this action. However, we hope the  Palestinian policemen will have a strong sense of responsibility  and will not obey idiotic orders against their own people. We  hope the youths of ['Izz-al-Din] al-Qassam will continue to  direct their rifles against the Zionist occupation. This is not  an easy thing. All faithful and sincere people should not be  neutral, but they must prevent any inter-Palestinian fighting.  What is taking place in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Somalia is  enough. There could be a ray of hope represented by an  escalation of the jihad against the occupation troops in the  West Bank. These mujahidin and intifadah youths will tell their  people: "This is the real battlefield, come and join us." Only  then will the crime of self-rule will be exposed.    [Al-Hijjawi] Can we understand from you that Hamas will seek  to calm the situation in Gaza and Jericho?    [Ghawshah] Hamas has declared that it will not confront the  self-rule by force. This is dictated by the principled and  national position. It is true that this is somewhat bitter, but  you should drink what is bitter if you want to overcome what is  more bitter. Avoiding resistance against the Palestinian police  force and self-rule in Gaza and Jericho is a Hamas policy which  it will pursue, God willing, in order to spare its people the  evils of internecine fighting. At the same time, those who  planned the agreement which was signed in Cairo on 4 May 1994  must know that the mujahidin will not stop their jihad and that  the intifadah people will not stop their intifadah. If the  other party continues to pressure and harm its people, the  consequences will be bad to all sides. We hope that this party  will not use all its weight to achieve all that the Zionists  want. We want to address a message to this party: "You are now  on the touchstone, and you must prove that you are with your  people and homeland, or otherwise, your people will discard you,  and you will become one of those men who collaborate with the  occupation and who are tools to it. This is the message we want  to address in the name of the movement. [passage omitted]    [Al-Hijjawi] There is a development in Hamas' political  approach, which was clear in Dr. Musa Abu-Marzuq's statements.  Is this development moving toward dealing with specific  political facts within the framework of a peace treaty, or is it  a truce? Is Hamas still adopting its previous stands?    [Ghawshah] Let me say the interview conducted with Dr. Musa  Abu-Marzuq contained some mistakes. Some of these mistakes were  what was attributed to him about a treaty. The truth is that  Hamas cannot agree on a treaty. This is a mistake. However,  what Hamas said in the past, and even through Shaykh Ahmad  Yasin, is that in case the Zionist forces withdrew and the  occupation was removed, then it would be possible for Hamas to  study a temporary truce. The temporary truce does not stipulate  recognition of the other party. In the law of war and peace in  Islam, truce is allowed. There is no objection to the truce  issue, if the terms will be in the interest of Muslims.  Regarding whether there has been a change in Hamas' strategic  and short-term program, the answer to this is: Hamas' strategic  and short-term program has not changed. The Hamas Movement  considers Palestine an Arab and Islamic land from the [Jordan]  River to the [Mediterranean] Sea. It is also an Islamic  endowment. No one is authorized to relinquish one inch of it.  Neither Shaykh Ahmad Yasin, nor Musa Abu-Marzuq, or Ibrahim  Ghawshah or anyone else can do this. None of them has ever done  this. This is part of the Muslims' creed. We cannot recognize  the Zionist entity, achieve reconciliation, or hold negotiations  with it. This is because as soon as we negotiate with it this  will mean an official recognition. If negotiations have to take  place, something which is ruled out, they will take place  through a third party. What the Hamas Movement proposed was a  short-term political view based on its strategic program. This  is a reply to those who always say that the Hamas Movement  program is nonexistent.    [Al-Hijjawi] How does Hamas view the recent Interior  Ministry  measures to facilitate Palestinians' movement?    [Ghawshah] The Islamic Resistance Movement was against the  disengagement decision, because it was unjustified. We believe  any measures adopted to facilitate visits by West Bank people  and youths to the East Bank will reinforce the firm unity  between the two peoples. We support unity between the two  peoples, and Arab and Islamic unity.</p>

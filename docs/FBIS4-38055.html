			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking at a General Staff forum on the Shamgar  Commission's recommendations, the chief of staff said the IDF  [Israel Defense Forces] will make preparations to implement the  commission's conclusions speedily and fully.    Our army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe notes that in  the wake of the commission's criticism, the IDF will soon issue  orders and clarifications concerning the use of gunfire against  settlers and violations of law and order in the territories by  Jews.    The Cave of the Patriarchs will open only when all the  security arrangements are in place and the complete separation  of Jews and Arabs is assured. The IDF will maintain a guard  force at the cave and bar armed worshipers from the site. IDF  sources stress that Army elements had cautioned already last  year that the law was not being enforced against settlers and  had requested police reinforcements at the site. IDF elements  stress that procedures for cooperation between the army and the  police are of vital importance at this time.</p>

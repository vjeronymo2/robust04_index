			<p><P> March 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole judged the political impact of the John Tower  affair to be "sort of a wash," but the Kansas Republican warned Democrats that  their decision to deal President Bush a historic defeat will not be forgotten  soon. "George Bush, in my view, has got a pretty good memory," Dole said three  days after Tower's rejection for the post of defense secretary. "He's not going  to do anything bad, but he remembers who helps and who hurts in the process."  Dole appeared on the NBC-TV news program "Meet the Press."  </P></p>

			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Observer: APR OTT Oh no, not the APR malarkey yet again. For those in ignorance - and according to a 1993 Office of Fair Trading survey, half of us are in that joyful state - APR stands for annual percentage rate, supposedly a useful benchmark for assessing the cost of borrowing. There are benchmarks, and then there are medieval banqueting tables fit for Henry VIII. One FT reader is astonished to learn that Lloyds Bank calculates an APR of 178.1 per cent for agreed overdrafts and one of 213.8 per cent for unauthorised overdrafts on the bank's gold service payment card. Lloyds explains that APRs for this type of card have been calculated on the assumption of a customer being Pounds 100 overdrawn, for a full year, paying no principal or interest, and incurring the monthly Pounds 8 charge. The reader has written back to his Lloyds branch inquiring about rates on deposits . . .</p>

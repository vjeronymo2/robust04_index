			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Hosokawa's manoeuvrings widen divisions within ruling coalition Japan's prime minister Mr Morihiro Hosokawa faced mounting criticism from within the ruling coalition yesterday over attempts to push for political realignment. Strong opposition from the left wing of the coalition forced Mr Hosokawa to shelve his plan to form a policy study group comprising coalition members, independents and some members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. It was feared such a group might become a new party. Mr Hosokawa's political manoeuvrings have widened a growing divide between the coalition's left and right wings. The Social Democratic party, the largest coalition member, as well as the New Harbinger party and the Democratic Socialist party, which form the leftist camp in the coalition, resisted Mr Hosokawa's moves. The coalition's two camps differ over economic, fiscal and industrial policies. On international affairs, Mr Ozawa's conservatives favour an internationally active Japan, while the liberals want a lower profile. Those on the left are suspicious of the right wing's aim in fielding single joint candidates against the LDP in the next general election. They are against the strong-armtechniques of Mr Ichiro Ozawa of the Japan Renewal party, the government's backroom powerbroker, and Mr Yuichi Ichikawa of the Buddhist-backed Komeito, or Clean Government party. They believe Mr Ozawa and his allies are masterminding Mr Hosokawa's plans. Mr Tomiichi Murayama, leader of the SDP, said setting up such a group 'would cause confusion within the coalition (and) should be avoided when the budget for next fiscal year is being delayed.' Parliamentary debate on the Y73,080bn (Pounds 705bn) budget plan for the year starting tomorrow has been stalled due to the parliamentary wrangle over a Y100m loan made to Mr Hosokawa a decade ago by Sagawa Kyubin transport company. While Mr Hosokawa has denied any impropriety, his public approval rate has declined steadily. The LDP is also pressingMr Hosokawa to make clear his role in the purchase of 300 Nippon Telegraph and Telephone shares by his father-in-law in 1986.</p>

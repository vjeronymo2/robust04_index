			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the UK Ministry of Defense on 11 May; </F> place not given: "Malcolm Rifkind Confirms Military Assistance  to South Africa"]    [Text] Malcolm Rifkind, Secretary of State for Defence,  today confirmed that a British Military Advisory and Training  team [BMATT] will be made available to go to South Africa to  help build the new National Defence Force.    Commanded by a Brigadier, the party of 31 men and women will  be drawn from all three services and their role will be to  validate selection criteria and training standards, to monitor  training across all four arms of the NDF (Army, Navy, Air Force  and Medical Service) and to adjudicate in any cases where  disagreements arise.    Mr Rifkind said: "I believe that we have one of the best  military forces in the world, and I am positive their  experience, expertise and efficiency will be of enormous benefit  in helping to build the new multi-ethnic armed forces in South  Africa."    It is expected that a core of nine members of the BMATT will  remain in South Africa on two-year resident tours, while the  remainder would go for shorter periods of about six months.    The unit should be assembled in South Africa by mid-June.</p>

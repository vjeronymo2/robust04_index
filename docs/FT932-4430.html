			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Confident Unigate achieves Pounds 101.4m UNIGATE, the food and distribution group, is increasing its dividend for the first time in three years, a 'clear signal of our confidence,' Sir Brian Kellett, chairman, said. Mr Ross Buckland, chief executive, said 'we do see the first indication of a gradual but real UK economic recovery.' The group reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 101.4m for the year to end-March, up from Pounds 65.7m, restated for FRS 3. But excluding exceptionals the rise was more modest, from Pounds 92m to Pounds 97.9m. The shares rose 20p to 355p. A final dividend of 10.4p is proposed for a total of 16.1p (15.3p) up 5.2 per cent. Earnings per share rose from 23.4p to 31.3p, though the underlying rise is from 27.3p to 29.8p. The figures are complicated by the move to FRS 3, which substantially reduces the 1992 profits as they include losses from discontinued businesses, notably the JP Wood poultry operation sold in February 1992, which were previously set off against provisions. Unigate's figures benefited from a Pounds 4m pension credit, although this will reduce to Pounds 3m in future years as employees' contributions are being reduced. Mr Buckland said that after acquisitions totalling Pounds 152m and disposals of Pounds 73m in the last 18 months there had been significant progress in reshaping the group. He said that the decision to postpone the US flotation of the Black-eyed Pea restaurant chain did not raise concerns about gearing, now more than 60 per cent, as interest cover would still be over 5 times. The sale is expected to go ahead in about a year's time, unless a trade buyer makes an offer meanwhile. Operating profits from continuing businesses rose from Pounds 88.9m to Pounds 92.7m, including the pension credit. Associates, mainly the Nutricia baby food business, rose from Pounds 13.7m to Pounds 14.4m, but this was because of the fall in sterling and an increase in Unigate's shareholding. Interest charges fell from Pounds 13m to Pounds 9.4m. Operating profits from dairies rose 5.9 per cent to Pounds 30.4m despite a 5.7 per cent fall in sales to Pounds 363m. Unigate cut out lower margin business and benefited from cost cutting and capital spending. Fresh food profits fell from Pounds 19.9m to Pounds 16.8m. Mr Buckland said levels of competition had been unprecedented and marketing spend had increased. Farm foods, such as bacon and turkeys, increased profits from Pounds 6.6m to Pounds 7.5m, and the US restaurants made Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 13.3m) despite a Pounds 1.2m provision for the closure of 4 restaurants. Wincanton, the distribution business, raised profits from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 15.4m. Vehicle sales and service profits were Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 3.7m) and Giltspur, the exhibitions business, made Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.9m). See Lex</p>

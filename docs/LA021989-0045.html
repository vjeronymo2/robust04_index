			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE AIR FARE CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> Regarding "Shopping for Emergency Air Fares" (by Lynn Simross, Jan. 26):  </P> <P> I am writing to thank Simross on behalf of my sister and brother-in-law. Last  Wednesday, my brother-in-law, Mike, was notified of the death of his father in  Michigan. On Thursday morning Simross' article was in the View section.  </P> <P> After trying two airlines with no success, he called American Airlines and the  agent agreed to give them the discount air fare -- saving them approximately  $1,000.  </P> <P> To have to face this unexpected and unplanned-for expense when you are so upset  just adds to your distress. So your information helped to ease the burden a  little by saving them a considerable amount of money.  </P> <P> SANDRA KLINE  </P> <P> Lancaster  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> GARAGES DRAINED OF GROUT, OIL IN TOXICS ROUNDUP  </P> <P> The day before Earth Day, the garages of Los Angeles emptied out their house  paint, batteries, crankcase oil, insecticide, rug shampoo, model airplane  paint, tile and grout sealer, and snail and slug killer for a household  hazardous-waste roundup at the Unocal refinery in Wilmington.  </P> <P> "Even got some low-fat yogurt," said Unocal environmental specialist John Van  Kooy, peering at a heap of containers in the refinery's parking lot.  </P> <P> "It's peach," he reported after a close examination.  </P> <P> The event drew an estimated 1,200 cars in six hours.  </P> <P> For much of the time, a slow-moving, half-mile-long line of traffic snaked west  of the parking lot as people from as far away as the San Fernando Valley waited  to get rid of their waste.  </P> <P> David Henth, 23, brought a trailer loaded with 600 gallons of paint all the way  from Granada Hills. He had acquired the paint, contained in fragile, rusty  pails, as part of the purchase of a house that needed fixing up.  </P> <P> Attendants in white safety suits told him to pull around for unloading.  </P> <P> But for most people, who had more modest hauls, the removal took place with the  efficiency of a fast-food operation.  </P> <P> David Broadbent, 39, an environmental consultant who lives in Lomita, sat in  his 1979 Triumph TR-7 convertible as an attendant relieved him of a single  automobile battery.  </P> <P> "Now you can go to the beach," the man said to Broadbent.  </P> <P> "I'm going to go back and paint my house," he replied.  </P> <P> The cleanup was co-sponsored by the Los Angeles Department of Public Works,  Standard Brands Paints, Western Waste Industries, Union Pacific Corp.'s  subsidiary USPCI, WH Tank Lines and McDonald's.  </P> <P> Although a similar roundup in Granada Hills last August drew about twice as  many cars, officials said the Unocal event attracted more business than they  could handle and pronounced it a success.  </P> <P> "There ought to be more of them," declared Richard Stegemeier, president,  chairman and chief executive officer of Unocal Corp. Stegemeier said Unocal  contributed about $150,000 for the cleanup.  </P> <P> The old motor oil will be recycled in fuel oil, he said. Standard Brands will  recycle the paint. Insecticides will be treated to eliminate toxicity before  disposal.  </P></p>

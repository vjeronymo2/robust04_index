A marketing man by background, Perry chose instead to use the occasion to promote the company's wares, producing a succession of new products out of a tatty cardboard box and lining them up on the rostrum. According to his colleagues, it wasn't just an act for the cameras; he's been known to do the same at board meetings.</p>

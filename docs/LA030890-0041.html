			<p><P> March 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DEATH OF HANK GATHERS;  </P> <P> GATHERS TOUCHED THOSE WHO KNEW HIM  </P> <P> It was in a hotel lobby somewhere on the road and I was trying to track down my  5-year-old. The lobby was small enough that I could hear clearly a resonant  voice call out: "My main man, come on in."  </P> <P> That was when I spotted my son peering through the slightly ajar door to a room  set aside for the Loyola Marymount basketball team's pregame meal. By the time  I reached him, the boy had already been introduced to the entire team, was  seated next to his new friend and was being asked his prediction on that  night's game. A hero was born.  </P> <P> Two years later, a different lobby, this one in a hospital, and a different  voice, telling me that the hero was gone, that he had literally played his  heart out. As I walked away, concerned how I would explain such mortal things  to a child, my shivering found a momentary refuge as I recalled the warmth of  that hotel encounter with Hank Gathers.  </P> <P> Perhaps it is just as well that many who stood to gain the most from his  acquaintance will never have to suffer the loss that those who knew him now  feel. I think of all the kids in NBA cities who will never have to miss his  infectious smile and friendly chatter, who may never have to learn that heroes,  no matter how strong, can leave us. Who will never have to learn to accept the  realization that when Hank Gathers autographed your program, he also made his  mark on your heart, indelibly.  </P> <P> JIM RYAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

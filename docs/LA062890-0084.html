			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SACRAMENTO;  </P> <P> MEASURE GUARDING INITIATIVES IS SET  </P> <P> A measure designed to prevent the Legislature from interfering with the  initiative process will appear on the November ballot, Secretary of State March  Fong Eu said. The initiative would change the state Constitution to require a  vote of the people on any proposed laws governing the process of putting ballot  measures before voters.  </P> <P> Sponsors of the measure, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn., submitted more than  1 million signatures, nearly twice the 595,485 valid signatures required to  qualify the initiative for the ballot. Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the  Jarvis tax group, said an initiative is a so-called people's law, adding: "We  believe people should have the right to approve any changes that are made to  their law." The measure would prevent lawmakers from making changes, such as  increasing the number of voter signatures required to qualify an initiative for  the ballot, without voter approval.  </P></p>

			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / BBC outlines new business strategy THE BBC has outlined to the government a new strategy for its commercial operations in its response to the green paper on the future of the corporation. The strategy is designed to answer criticism that the corporation has abused its privileged position to compete unfairly in the market with other television groups and publishers. The ITV companies, for example, last week attacked the BBC's involvement in UK Gold, an advertising-funded satellite channel. In the past publishers have criticised the way the BBC used its airwaves to promote its magazines. Mr Bob Phillis, the new deputy director-general, said the aim had been to produce a coherent and defensible policy for participating in commercial activities. 'That does not mean legitimising everything we have done in the past nor does it mean restricting ourselves from opportunities that may exist in the future,' Mr Phillis said. He declined to elaborate in advance of publication of the BBC's green paper document later this month but added: 'We will be looking always for a link to our core purpose as programme makers.' Money earned by the corporation through commercial activities goes back into programmes. The new policy outlined in response to the government is designed not only to be fair to the marketplace but to be seen to be fair. It will be the first time the BBC has drawn up and published detailed criteria governing commercial activities. However, it seems unlikely that the BBC will be pulling out of advertising-funded operations around the world, although launching magazines not directly linked to programmes may come into question in future. Mr Phillis is also chairing a new commercial and business sub-committee of the board of management to work out in detail the new policy. Mr Phillis said: 'By the end of July a small tight sub committee will be up and running. We will have declared and established a coherent commercial strategy for the organisation,' said Mr Phillis. In his first interview since taking over as deputy director-general six weeks ago the former chief executive of Independent Television News also defended Producer Choice, the system of giving production departments the freedom to buy the services they need on the open market - a system which started at the beginning of last month. Mr Phillis said: 'When the system is fully operational and if it works in the way that it is intended the BBC will be a more efficient organisation. There will be more money going into programmes.' He accepted, however, that the benefits were not likely to flow in full from day one because of the complexity of the change and the enormous impact it will have on how the BBC works. For the first time BBC services are fully-costed and producers can go whereever they can find the best quality and price.</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Books: Fantasy kingdom in scrambled centuries - FT Children's Book of the Month THE CROWN OF DALEMARK by Diana Wynne Jones Mandarin Pounds 3.99, 494 pages CHILDREN have an appetite for fantasy that is largely lacking in adults. That much is a truism, But why? Because fantasy feeds the child's own appetite for the freest and the wildest kind of speculation upon every aspect of the mystery of the life into which it has just been catapulted. That is not to say, however, that successful fantasy does not depend upon rules. On the contrary, rules are of the essence. Good fantasy - Mary Norton's The Borrowers, for example, or Alice - may distort life (by a trick as simple as enlargement or miniaturisation, for example) but it also oddly mirrors it. Its truths are queerly, subversively true. Values and anti-values intermesh in provocatively interesting ways, and it is all to the good if (as in Alice again) the 'real' world that a book has been oddly mirroring reasserts itself at the end of all that speculative travelling. And this is precisely what happens in The Crown of Dalemark, the fourth and final book in Diana Wynne Jones's Dalemark cycle of novels. Diana Wynne Jones has been limning the features of the imaginary kingdom of Dalemark for almost 20 years. The first three books in the cycle appeared relatively close together, between 1975 and 1979, while this fourth and concluding novel (which is also, incidentally, the longest by far) has occupied her intermittently for the past ten years. The chronological span of the quartet is enormous - from the pre-history of the kingdom to its present day - but our attention is by no means equally divided amongst the different historical epochs. The quartet begins with Cart and Cwidder (Mandarin, Pounds 3.99) which is set in the South of the country sometime in the 18th century, and it describes the time-honoured role of the mysterious Singers, an ancient race of itinerant musicians who are able to travel freely between the North and South of the country: public performers, but also custodians of many old customs, sayings and beliefs. In this book we learn one of the most important facts about Dalemark itself: that the country, once ruled by a king, is now divided between the North and the South, and that within each of these separate parts there are a number of warring earldoms. The second book, Drowned Ammet (Mandarin, Pounds 3.99) which is set in the Earldom of Holand (also in the South), is almost entirely taken up with an account of the growth to maturity of one young boy, Mitt, whose father is killed in a hopeless attempt to overthrow Earl Hadd, the tyrannical ruler of the country. Mitt vows to assassinate him, and when he fails he is obliged to flee North by sea. The third book, The Spellcoats, plunges us back into pre-history. Tanaqui the weaver and her family, all natives of the village of Shelling in the prehistoric Riverlands kingdom of Dalemark, are suspected by the rest of the villagers of being in thrall to some evil influence that has set a blight upon the village and its life; when the great flood arrives, the family flees downriver to the sea. At this stage in its history, Dalemark is under threat from invading Heathen forces. The fourth book, The Crown of Dalemark, pulls the various strands together. Mitt, now a fugitive in the North of the country, is ordered to kill a young unknown woman in order to safeguard the lives of his friends. That unknown woman, he discovers, is no less than the person who has been chosen to reunite the ancient kingdom of Dalemark by riding the royal road to Kernsburgh: Noreth Onesdaughter. But there is a pleasing shock in store - on page 61 of this last book, after we have thoroughly immersed ourselves in the alternative world of a fantasy kingdom that has been constructed so painstakingly, detail by detail, over almost 900 pages of prose, we find ourselves in the company of Maewen, a teenage girl on a train in the present, who is travelling to meet her father, Head Curator of the Tannoreth Palace, the royal palace that stands in the old part of the new town of Kernsburgh. According to him, Maewen is related to Amil the Great, the old king that built the palace, through her mother's line. And when Noreth Onesdaughter is brutally murdered, it is Maewen who is called back to the past as a substitute in order for the history of the kingdom to run its appointed course. And why Maewen anyway? Can it be more than the fact that she is Noreth Onesdaughter's spitting image? This is Wynne Jones at her most inspired - scrambling the centuries, gyrating the real and the unreal, the 'fantasy' of the past and the 'reality' of the present, at such a speed that everything merges in a delicious miasma of one's own imaginings.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Where the main thrust of the DTI's new competitive policy will be focused ...: One-stop shops a 'one-stop shop' for companies of all types and sizes requiring information and advice on every aspect of running a business in a cut-throat, competitive world. Last July's announcement that the DTI intended to create a nationwide chain of centres representing 'a revolution in the delivery of business services' has been widely dismissed by sceptics as a gimmick. Many remain unconvinced that the initiative will provide any real benefit for business. The DTI, however, puts the plan close to the centre of its efforts to help industry help itself. To back its words, it is putting in Pounds 5.5m over the next three years. There were 57 applications from partnerships - invariably involving local chambers, training and enterprise councils, enterprise agencies and business organisations - which competed for government cash to help operate the centres. Some of those which failed plan to have another go. Six initial winners have been given the go-ahead to open 23 units - dubbed 'marriage bureaux' by Baroness Denton, the minister for small businesses - in Manchester, Birmingham, Cheshire, Tyneside and Hertfordshire. The first should be opening in July. The DTI hopes that around 50 shops will be operating by the end of the year and up to 200 are planned. The units will normally be open from early morning until well into the evening. Some services will be free but others will be charged for. The shops will be open to businesses of all sizes. Customers will be able to seek advice on a range of issues, from market intelligence and exporting to training and guidance on available finance, possibly including locally available private funds. Small companies might be able to plug into video-conference facilities and will have access to databanks normally beyond their resources. The emphasis will be on networking, designed to make life easier for business executives who feels they operate in a lonely world. Mr Heseltine claims that the 'one-stop shops' will replace the present bewildering range of business support services - 'the vast majority of which companies have no idea actually exist'.</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / People: Lee chooses to do it himself Des Lee, information technology director at B&amp;Q, Kingfisher's do-it-yourself retailer, resigned unexpectedly last week. Lee, who says the separation from B&amp;Q was entirely amicable, is one of the best known figures in UK data processing management. News of his departure spread quickly through the digital grapevine and brought a number of job offers. But Lee, life president of the UK IBM computer-users' association, says he is in no hurry to return to full-time employment. He will carry out a number of consultancy projects over the next few months, some of them for B&amp;Q, and then decide his future. His departure from B&amp;Q seems to have been a consequence of the arrival last year of Alan Smith as chief executive; he has been busy establishing a new direction for the company and bringing in his own senior staff to help him implement it. Lee's dp achievements include Limnet, the London insurance market system, installed while he was head of IT at Lloyds of London, and B&amp;Q's supply chain system - which he modestly describes as Britain's best.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / SFO officer asks Ankara for help over Nadir case A SENIOR officer of the Serious Fraud Office has flown to Turkey in an effort to prevent Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman from travelling from his home in northern Cyprus to the Turkish mainland. News of this latest initiative, undertaken without publicity by the SFO, came as Mr John Major conceded that Mr Michael Mates, the Northern Island security minister, had committed a 'misjudgment' in giving a watch to the fugitive businessman Mr Asil Nadir, but not 'a hanging offence'. Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case was holding meetings with senior officials in Turkey after flying secretly to Ankara on Monday for a week-long mission to break the deadlock over the fugitive businessman who jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail on May 5. Ms Harris, speaking from Ankara, would not comment on which Turkish authorities she was seeing or what response she had met with so far. She added: 'We are intent in pursuing all legitimate means to make sure that Asil Nadir attends the trial he is due to attend in September of this year.' However Mr John Goulden, the British Ambassador in Turkey, confirmed that Ms Harris had met Turkish authorities. He said it was part of a 'continuing process' of co-operation on the case between Turkish and British officials. This is believed to be the first time Ms Harris, the case controller of the Polly Peck affair, has travelled to Turkey and underscores the growing concern that Mr Nadir may try to travel there. UK officials believe this could jeopardise efforts to encourage Mr Nadir to return to the UK to face charges. Contacted at his home in Lapta earlier this week, Mr Nadir restated his intention to fly to Turkey 'very soon,' to regain the remnants of his former business empire. In recent days, Mr Nadir's Turkish lawyers have successfully prevented the sale of his Gunaydin newspaper title and had a power of attorney given to his administrators in bankruptcy revoked in the Turkish courts, thus preventing efforts to dispose of Media Print, a company with assets worth several million pounds. Turkey's interior minister, Mr Ismet Sezgin, has said publicly that Mr Nadir is free to travel to the mainland, although informally Turkish officials are understood to have urged Mr Nadir not to travel to Turkey. Foreign minister Hikmet Cetin reaffirmed Turkey's 'full co-operation' on the Nadir affair in talks with UK officials at the end of May. In the Commons yesterday Mr Major admitted that Mr Mates, had been unwise to give the fugitive businessman a watch with a supportive inscription. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, attacked the prime minister over the way in which both Mr Mates and Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade secretary, had raised Mr Nadir's case with the attorney-general. He accused Mr Mates of undermining the work of the SFO in giving Mr Nadir the watch, and described the whole affair as 'shabby and unseemly'. Mr Major emphasised that Mr Mates had no financial involvement with Mr Nadir, his companies or advisers. The Department of Trade and Industry yesterday responded to calls from MPs - including Mr Robin Cook, shadow secretary trade and industry - that Mr Heseltine should start proceedings to have Mr Nadir disqualified as a company director. The DTI said: 'Mr Nadir is an undischarged bankrupt and as such his disqualification from acting directly or indirectly in the management of a company until he is discharged from bankruptcy is not considered necessary.'

			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, June 2 (XINHUA) -- U.S. President Bill  Clinton formally notified the congress Thursday [2 June] of his  decision to renew the most-favored-nation trading status for  China, a White House official said.    The notification was announced in Rome where Clinton is on a  visit as part of his eight-day European trip celebrating the  50th anniversary of D-Day.    Earlier on May 26, Clinton told a White House news  conference  in Washington that he had decided to extend China's MFN and was  moving to separate the linkage between human rights and MFN  renewal.    The deadline for the President to send a formal notification  to Congress is June 3.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION WATER POLO CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> CORONA DEL MAR RALLIES TO TAKE 4-A TITLE  </P> <P> Corona del Mar High School, seeking a third consecutive Southern Section 4-A  water polo titles, ran into a determined challenge Wednesday night.  </P> <P> Villa Park made all the right moves and got the breaks during the first half.  But the Spartans couldn't stand prosperity and the Sea Kings got their third  title.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar put together a three-goal run in the third quarter, then held  off the Spartans for a 10-9 victory at Belmont Plaza Pool.  </P> <P> "I love all the titles we've won equally, but I think I appreciate them more as  I get older," said Coach John Vargas. "I'll have to think about whether I'll be  back next season."  </P> <P> The Sea Kings (27-3) have won 19 of their past 20 playoff games. They also have  won four of the past five 4-A titles.  </P> <P> But at the start, the Spartans (25-5) looked like the experienced team. Villa  Park, which has never beaten Corona del Mar in eight tries, picked apart the  Sea King defense and led, 5-4, at halftime.  </P> <P> The Spartans increased their lead to 6-4 with less than two minutes gone in the  third quarter on a goal by Gavin Arroyo.  </P> <P> "I felt we were in fine shape at that point," Villa Park Coach Jeff Ehrlich  said. "Then everything fell apart."  </P> <P> The Sea Kings scored three times in the last three minutes of the third  quarter. Brandon Howald scored two of the goals, including a turn-around shot  that gave Corona del Mar a 7-6 lead with 47 seconds remaining in the quarter.  The Sea Kings never relinquished the lead.  </P> <P> A goal by Villa Park's Eric Johnson cut the Sea King lead to 8-7 with 4:43  left. The Spartans had two opportunities to tie the score, but they turned the  ball over on the first, and goalie Rob Pike made a diving save on the second.  </P></p>

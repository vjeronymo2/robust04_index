			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS REPEALS CURBSIDE HIRING BAN AS SUIT LOOMS  </P> <P> The Encinitas City Council on Wednesday voted unanimously and without comment  to repeal its curbside hiring ban, two days before a hearing in U.S. District  Court to consider a suit filed against the city over the ban.  </P> <P> The council's action follows U.S. District Judge John Rhoades' issuance two  weeks ago of a temporary restraining order against enforcement of the ban.  Migrant advocates had brought suit against the city, claiming the ban infringed  on both migrant and employer rights to free speech.  </P> <P> The council had approved the never-enforced ban in May to curtail the  street-corner gathering of migrants seeking employment.  </P> <P> The council also voted Wednesday to pay $18,000 for attorney's fees incurred by  the plaintiffs in the case.  </P> <P> In issuing the restraining order, Rhoades wrote that the ordinance would "pose  unconstitutional restriction on free speech, so as to violate on its face the  First Amendment and California's liberty-of-speech clause."  </P> <P> "We're sorry that the court didn't feel that the solution that the City Council  had selected was a legally viable one," City Atty. Roger Krauel said. "We still  are faced with a very big problem, and the solution and approach that we had  embarked upon is not the only solution and approach, and we are going to  continue to look for solutions."  </P> <P> Among the preferred solutions is more help from the federal government in  enforcing migrant law. Encinitas got some of that help this week as U.S. Border  Patrol agents began a monthlong surveillance of curbside hiring to see that  would-be employers check a laborer's immigration status.  </P> <P> "The cooperation that we're currently getting from the Border Patrol is what we  needed, and that's all we actually ever wanted," Mayor Pam Slater said before  Wednesday's meeting.  </P> <P> However, the concentrated presence of Border Patrol agents is only temporary,  and the problems posed by curbside hiring may continue after the surveillance  ends, officials said.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Gail Hano said that, after the Border Patrol finishes its  monthlong stint, the city may seek help from the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> "If it means calling them on a daily basis, that's what we're going to have to  do," she said.  </P> <P> Hano is especially frustrated with the federal government, which she says is  relegating the task of dealing with the migrant population to the city.  </P> <P> "We might actually send (the federal government) the bills that the city of  Encinitas has incurred due to this problem," Hano said.  </P> <P> Some feel that the fate of Encinitas' 8-month-old hiring hall may be tied to  the demise of the curbside hiring ban.  </P> <P> "The City Council in general felt that the success of the hiring hall was  dependent on the success of the hiring ban," said Gloria Carranza, the city's  transient-issues coordinator.  </P> <P> With the termination of the ordinance, Carranza fears, the hiring hall may be  next on the chopping block.  </P> <P> The hiring hall's performance will be evaluated in August when the council  considers its budget.  </P> <P> Hano believes that, although the hall has placed about 60% of the people who  have come to it in search of work, it has not been effective in addressing  curbside hiring.  </P></p>

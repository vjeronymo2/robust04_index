			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / Lamont faces probes on cash aid CONTRIBUTIONS towards a Pounds 23,000 legal bill incurred by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, for evicting a 'sex therapist' from his London house are to be scrutinised by two MP committees next week, David Owen writes. On Tuesday, the committee on members' interests will consider a draft report drawn up by Sir Geoffrey Johnson Smith, its Tory chairman, about the handling of a contribution of more than Pounds 18,000 from an anonymous Tory benefactor. On Wednesday, the public accounts committee is expected to turn its attention to aspects of a Treasury payment of Pounds 4,700 towards the bill. Mr Robert Sheldon, the committee's Labour chairman, said yesterday he would be 'putting a proposition' to the cross-party body next Wednesday. Committee members expect to be handed a report by the National Audit Office on the matter at that meeting.</p>

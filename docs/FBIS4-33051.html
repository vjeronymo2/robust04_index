			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yolanda Ojeda Reyes; quotation marks as published] </F>   [Text] Last night a meeting was held at the Miraflores  Presidential Palace, where there was word of what BCV [Central  Bank of Venezuela] President Antonio Casas Gonzalez called "the  good news" of yesterday's "great tendency for foreign exchange  to stabilize." Bankers offered their support to the present  system because the BCV promised to supply currency according to  market offers, making rational use of international reserves,  which are at an "adequate level."    Tuesday's increase in the dollar exchange rate came as no  surprise to the BCV, "because a free system was instituted." The  BCV had to supply currency according to market offers; this is  what it is all about. "We do not accept rumors of exchange  control, because we are not thinking of this. International  reserves are at an adequate level (did not mention the amount),  which gives us sufficient flexibility to cover import needs and  to face the exchange rate situation."    The BCV directorate hopes that yesterday's trend repeats  itself in the next few days and that our currency finally  stabilizes. The directorate added that businesses and people who  purchased dollars over the past few weeks unloaded them in view  of the possibility that exchange rates could drop and they  "might lose." The BCV directorate is aware of an important  transaction among three banks involving $4 million. Casas  Gonzalez affirmed that there should be trust in the bolivar,  which is backed by the BCV. "There are no great dangers at this  moment; we need to change our attitude and not speculate."    Regarding interest rates, Casas Gonzalez said that it is  impossible to reduce them with the expectation of inflation; "if  we do, the flight of capital increases. It is an illusion to say  that interest rates can be reduced. One cannot stop dollars from  leaving or attract investments without real positive interests."  We have ruled out the so-called solidarity commitment to reduce  the productive sectors' active rates, which was proposed by  [Commissioner for Financial Reforms Gustavo] Roosen. "This does  not mean that we agree with the situation, but all countries  defend their currency with this mechanism."    He added that the "crawling peg" [preceding words in  English]  system was given up on 1 May because it was no longer effective.  This is no time to think there is a perfect system "when we are  living a situation such as this where there is a crisis of  confidence."    We seek a balance between availability and demand. Reserves  are used as cautiously as possible. While supplying the market  to stabilize the bolivar, "the struggle to maintain reserves  continues being a priority, but, along with reserves, we want  stability. We cannot change the currency market scheme  overnight."    Regarding [Finance Minister Julio] Sosa Rodriguez's  statement  that the dollar exchange should be set at 150 bolivares, Casas  Gonzalez said that this is determined by the market. "We hope it  will be more or less this amount. Some technicians have  estimated this, but I cannot give an exact amount, because I do  not know what psychological factor will affect the rate."    We know that there is a back order and that this is why we  have to supply the market to cover part of it, but there is also  much artificial demand." [New BCV director] Domingo Maza Zavala  was the most notable absentee. The finance minister came out of  the meeting satisfied and said "tomorrow (today) I will meet  with the IMF president."</p>

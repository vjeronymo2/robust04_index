			<p>BFN     [Text] Warsaw, May 6 -- President Lech Walesa received on  Friday British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, who is on a  working visit to Poland. President said that he is satisfied  with Polish-British relations and stressed that Poland attaches  great importance to bilateral relations. He also expressed the  hope that the Polish point of view on the development of  situation in eastern Europe would be better understood by Great  Britain.    Douglas Hurd expressed his satisfaction at the meeting  emphasising that Poland made huge progress on the path of  transformations under Walesa's leadership. Changes taking place  in Europe, however, require cooperation, especially in  political, economical and military areas. Our common aim, said  the British politician, should be unification of Europe, whose  Poland is a very important member.</p>

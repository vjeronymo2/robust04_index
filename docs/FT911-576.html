			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Associate of Milken indicted MR Alan Rosenthal, a key business associate of Mr Michael Milken and a former head of the Beverly Hills-based convertible bond department of Drexel Burham Lambert, has been indicted by a federal grand jury on a variety of charges, including conspiracy, mail and securities fraud, embezzlement and providing an illegal guarantee. The indictment alleges that Mr Rosenthal conspired with Mr Milken, the former Drexel 'junk bond king', and others, to confer unlawful economic benefits on a former Drexel client, Mr David Solomon, and to misappropriate funds from Solomon's clients. It also claims that one of Mr Rosenthal's con-conspirators was Mr Solomon himself, who ran a high-yield money management firm, Solomon Asset Management. If found guilty on all charges, Mr Rosenthal could face a prison sentence of 51 years or Dollars 2.3m in fines. Mr Milken is already serving a prison sentence after pleading guilty to securities law violations.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / People: Royal Insurance Robert Mendelsohn, 47, is to take over as chief executive officer of the US subsidiary of ROYAL INSURANCE, following the retirement of William Buckley, 57, from his positions both as president and chief executive officer of the company and as a director of Royal's holding company. Until last year, Mendelsohn was president and chief operating officer of WR Berkley Corporation, a successful non-life company whose recent operating results have compared favourably with the rest of the US industry. If Berkley's advertising slogan - 'Volume is vanity, profit is sanity' - is any indication, Mendelsohn should feel at home with Royal's emphasis on underwriting discipline rather than market share. Royal's US company, which is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, is ranked in the top 30 property and casualty insurance companies in the United States and is rated A- by AM Best Company. It has a share of just under 1 per cent of the US market.</p>

			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Sport: Let battle begin - Baseball / Spring training over, Jurek Martin previews the 1993 season THIS year's rites of spring training were not generally wonderful for the baseball season, which starts on Monday when Bill Clinton, a promising young left-hander, throws the opening ball in Baltimore and his wife, taking a break from US health care reform, does the same in Chicago. Among the headlines: two Cleveland Indian pitchers were killed in a Florida boating accident; George Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees, returned after a ban; and Marge Schott, owner of the Cincinnatti Reds, started one for racist remarks (so did her dog, banned from the field in Cincinatti for unsanitary behaviour). Meanwhile, Barry Bonds, baseball's highest-paid player, was proving he could be as boorish in San Francisco as he was sometimes in Pittsburgh. But spring training is also a time of hope and magic, and this one was no exception because the truly beguiling stories centred on the possible restoration to the big time of an illustrious pair who had seem consigned to the scrap-heap; Fernando Valenzuela and Bo Jackson. The Financial Times has long had an interest in Valenzuela. The Mexican screw-ball artist was the best left-handed pitcher in the game for the first half of the 1980s. We commemorated his arrival as a Los Angeles Dodger in 1981 as a 'pitcher of innocence': regretfully, we recorded his apparent demise 10 years later under a headline 'Fernando the deceiver lays down his arm.' He picked it up again at home in the Mexican leagues over the past 18 months, but without staggering success. When, in February, the Baltimore Orioles announced they had signed him to a minor league contract and invited him to camp, it was seen generally either as a quixotic gesture or, more darkly, as a public relations ploy because a senior Oriole scout had been quoted in the Mexican press making disparaging remarks about Hispanic players. Valenzuela's first outing as an Oriole was almost a disaster. He loaded the bases with nobody out and, after three consecutive pitches outside the strike zone to the next batter, was one pitch away from giving up at least a run. But two fast-balls and two screw-balls later he was out of it, unscathed, with a strike-out and a double play. He followed that with three scoreless innings, then another five, then another two, then two more. Suddenly, he presented the Orioles with a problem because they seemed to have no room for an extra starting pitcher. They have the marvellous young Mike Mussina, arguably the game's next great pitcher; Rick Sutcliffe, ageing and curmudgeonly but a clubhouse leader; Ben MacDonald and Arthur Rhodes, both young and talented; and Mark Williamson, impressive after recovering from arm surgery. But with Valenzuela showing that his screw-ball could still get batters out, and with his fast-ball paced respectably again, manager Johnny Oates began to rethink. Although Valenzuela attracted ever-greater crowds in Florida, the Orioles' Camden Yards stadium is pretty much sold out in advance, so he cannot generate the extra income for the club that he did in his glory years in Los Angeles when, routinely, he added thousands to the gate every time he pitched. In any case, Baltimore does not have the Hispanic population of the West Coast. But the thought of Mussina and Valenzuela in harness is a hugely enticing prospect. Even the hard-headed Oates might find it so. The Bo Jackson story is of comparable charm. A crashing football running back and muscular baseball slugger, he was a two-sport phenomenon. Only Deion Sanders, of the two Atlanta teams, pulls off the same trick - and he is not yet in Jackson's league in either sport. Crippled by a football injury two years ago and released by the Kansas City Royals, Jackson played a little baseball, unsuccessfully, at the end of the 1991 season for the Chicago White Sox. Last spring, he had hip replacement surgery - not usually the sort of operation from which people recover to play anything else than the most sedentary sport. When the White Sox offered him a provisional contract at the start of this spring training, it was reckoned, like the Orioles with Valenzuela, to be partly an act of charity. But Jackson was a batting leader throughout spring training and, if no longer as powerfully graceful as he once was, he remains mobile enough to play the outfield, even if with a minor limp and a hitch in his stride. 'I've never worked so hard in my life,' he said. 'Things always came easy to me.' The man has a transcendent spirit. Picking this year's winners is, as ever, a mug's game in spring. But in the National League, Atlanta's pitching, reinforced by the acquisition from Chicago of last year's Cy Young award-winner, Mike Maddux, is simply too good to ignore. The New York Mets still have the talent on paper but their pitchers have endured a roughish, injury-prone spring and last year's clubhouse mood was dire. The most competitive baseball probably will be played in the American League East with the Toronto Blue Jays, winners of last season's World Series, changed but still powerful and the Orioles and Milwaukee Brewers not far behind. Nor can the Yankees be overlooked, Steinbrenner permitting, if Jim Abbott and Jimmy Key, signed over the winter, pitch up to expectations. Atlanta apart, the respective western divisions of both leagues have less intrinsic charm although Nolan Ryan's final season down in Texas would, in a just world, be crowned by another no-hitter. In such a world, Steinbrenner and Schott would take Trappist vows; baseball's owners would see the wisdom of finding an independent commissioner; there would be more day games, especially in the World Series; and next year's season would not be threatened by contract disputes. And, of course, Fernando would win 20 games (well, maybe 15) and Bo would bang 30 home runs. In spring, one may dream.</p>

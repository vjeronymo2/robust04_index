			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / Rao confident of surviving scandal: Indian inflation turns downwards THE INDIAN government of Prime Minister P V Narasimha Rao faces a new session of parliament today with growing confidence that the opposition will be unable to substantiate charges of ministers' involvement in the Bombay financial scandal. The Finance Ministry also believes that inflation is at last turning downwards. It has been running at 12 to 13 per cent over the past year and has provided the principal weapon for critics of the government's economic reforms. Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said that he was confident that inflation would come down from month to month to a single digit rate by the end of the financial year. But, anticipating a big assault from the opposition over its handling of the financial scandal, the government seems ready to yield ground by agreeing to the setting up of a joint parliamentary commission to investigate the scandal. The opposition has demanded an independent inquiry on the grounds that both the Reserve Bank and the police investigations have been carried out by arms of the government - and have thus dodged uncomfortable questions over the involvement of ministers and senior government officials and over the role of the central bank. Such an inquiry is likely to put further pressure on Mr R. Venkitaramanan, the Reserve Bank governor, who is at risk of becoming the main scapegoat of the scandal. Mr Singh this week expressed his continuing confidence in the governor and spoke of the difficulties he had faced. But the government also seems prepared to sacrifice him if need be. All the opposition parties are intending to vote against the government in a no-confidence motion over its handling of the scandal, which is expected to be tabled in the early days of the session. Though the government has only a bare majority, its co-ordination is better than that of the opposition. In addition, none of the opposition parties is yet ready for an election. At least two ministers are constantly named in private conversations in Delhi as having an involvement in the scandal. But ministers and senior officials seem increasingly confident that the opposition does not have material to substantiate charges of wrongdoing. The government's confidence has been strengthened by some signs of improvement in the main economic indicators. The inflation rate has dropped to just over 11 per cent and government economists believe that the year-on-year rate will descend to single digits in the next few months. A rise in imports in the February to May period is seen as a sign of industrial production picking up and officials are encouraged by the large number of companies planning to focus more on exports. But with industrialised economies in prolonged recession, there is much uncertainty over how strong the growth in export performance will be. There is also uncertainty over whether the government - already on the defensive over the financial scandal - will have the courage to push ahead with unpopular economic decisions.</p>

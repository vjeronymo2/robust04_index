			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Small cheques, big problems - Exporters owed tiny amounts face steep bank charges A year ago Colefax and Fowler, the up-market UK fabric and wallpaper maker, was facing a revolt in continental Europe. Export sales were increasing from its fabric division, but distributors and retailers were up in arms because of the amounts their banks were charging for the large number of small cheques Colefax required. Faced with this, customers tended to wait until they had received a number of invoices before paying; and in return Colefax and Fowler had begun threatening legal action. Worse, many customers were paying with foreign currency cheques written on their local banks which took up to 28 days to clear in the UK. The revolt came to a head at last July's annual distributors' meeting. Without knowing how to achieve it, David Green, Colefax and Fowler's chief executive, promised a solution by September. Colefax and Fowler's experience is by no means unique. All UK exporters making large numbers of relatively low-value sales will have met the problem. When French or German customers pay Franc or D-Mark cheques the banks can charge the equivalent of at least Pounds 15. If, as with Colefax and Fowler, each invoice is only Pounds 96 on average, these bank charges stack up. Telegraphic transfer is no cheaper and even if payment is made directly to foreign currency accounts at a UK bank the banks will still take up to 28 days to clear each cheque. Colefax and Fowler found a solution that would not be necessary in a genuine single European market. With help from the Bank Relationship Partnership, a London-based consultancy that helps cut the cost of banking, Colefax and Fowler set up local currency bank accounts in each country where it has a significant customer base. Customers now pay directly to Colefax and Fowler's local account, for which the charges are minimal and where payments are quickly cleared. The next stage is the clever part. Instead of sending bank statements to the UK, the local bank in Germany sends them daily to the local office of EDM, a Netherlands-based agency that handles the collection of huge quantities of small payments for companies such as National Geographic, Newsweek and New England Journal of Medicine. EDM then faxes Colefax and Fowler details of what they have received that day, enabling the company to credit the customers' accounts. When cash balances reach a reasonable size, the money is transferred to the UK. The saving is not only at the customer's end. Colefax and Fowler says that on export sales of Pounds 4m a year, it has saved about Pounds 45,000 on lost interest while its foreign cheques were clearing. The company says this may indirectly have increased sales; some customers were being denied credit not because they had not paid old invoices but because their cheques had not cleared. Because the customers were no longer hoarding invoices before paying, export creditor days have fallen from 86 to 73 days. And as some customers were also deducting their bank's charges from the invoice amounts, Colefax and Fowler also saved bank charges. 'It has enhanced our customer service immensely,' says Denise Walker, chief financial accountant at Colefax and Fowler. 'They can buy more and it is very satisfactory from an administrative point of view.' Walker says the company's own bank, Midland, were 'either apathetic or just didn't have the service'. Midland said it could set up foreign accounts or a lockbox - a variant of the system put in place for Colefax and Fowler. 'But that was the last we heard of it. They were not interested at all.' Green missed his September target by a month as opening bank accounts in some countries proved to be easier said than done. But the company says many more exporters are likely to use this kind of service.</p>

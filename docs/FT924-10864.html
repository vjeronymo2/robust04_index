			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Row over rise in drugs bill for NHS A ROW has erupted between the pharmaceuticals industry and the Department of Health over the rapidly expanding National Health Service drugs bill, Paul Abrahams writes. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry yesterday warned that the rapid increase in the drugs bill had been caused primarily by government policy. Measures taken against the industry could be highly damaging. The NHS drugs bill increased by 11.9 per cent to Pounds 3.138bn last year, the association estimates. Dr John Griffin, association director, blamed the expansion on an increase in the number of prescriptions. The government had set doctors targets for the number of patients they screened and this had led to more prescriptions. He added: 'Volume has been pushed up by government pressure. Now the health department is screaming because of the bill the government created for itself. The industry risks being penalised for the success of the government's policies. The department is looking for a scapegoat and the industry is an easy target.' Scrip, an independent industry newsletter, said that in England the number of prescriptions was 17.6 per cent more in July compared with the same month last year. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, has warned she will be looking at the annual Pounds 69 per head drugs bill.</p>

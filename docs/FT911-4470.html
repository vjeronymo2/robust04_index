			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Observer: Heir apparent Speculation that Helmut Kohl is tired of office has been rife in Bonn since the chancellor last week unexpectedly confirmed that he regards interior minister Wolfgang Schauble as his heir apparent. Schauble, confined to a wheelchair after an attack by a deranged gunman in October, has made a plucky job of coming to terms with his disability. Still more important, he is probably the most intelligent man in the cabinet. Bonn insiders have long known that Kohl had selected Schauble as a possible successor, and the chancellor's support for Schauble seems even to have strengthened after the attempt on his life. One Kohl adviser said a few months ago that had it not been for the shooting, Schauble would have been a contender to take over perhaps in only two years' time. As it is the most likely moment for the succession was in the next legislature period starting in 1995, he said. What has surprised observers is that Kohl has chosen the present period of political turbulence - caused by the economic crisis in eastern Germany - to make his deliberations public. Kohl's ruminations, delivered on the eve of regional elections in his home state of Rhineland-Palatinate, may have been partly tactical - to show the party and the nation that he knows he is not indispensable. Even though Kohl is certainly not enjoying his job as much as he did last year, things will have to get much worse before he thinks seriously of giving up.</p>

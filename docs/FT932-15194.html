			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Guns and butter on the road to Tuzla: Laura Silber travels the war-devastated route aid officials call Bosnia's Ho Chi Minh trail WITH a Sieg Heil salute, the Croat militia man waves the packed car through a check point on the road to Tuzla. Peering through his sun-glasses, he asks the driver for a permit from the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) allowing him to leave Herceg-Bosna, as they call the self-styled Croat state. Emir, a Moslem worker, shows his pass to the militia man, who has a gold 'U' pinned to his uniform - in honour of the Ustashe, pro-Nazi Croats during the Second World War. The latest war has devastated the infrastructure of former Yugoslavia. A once simple two-hour journey between Tuzla and Belgrade has become a harrowing three-day expedition in which you have to travel a near circle around a shattered country patrolled by gunmen. This war is about territory and control of the roads. To travel between 'free' Bosnia and Serbia involves a 12-hour drive via Split on Croatia's Adriatic coast, a flight via Zagreb, and another drive through Croatia on the Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, watched over for the past year by UN peacekeepers. Passenger cars, battered lorries and white UN vehicles ply the Tuzla road to and from Split, nicknamed by relief workers the Ho Chi Minh trail. The road is circuitous, hazardous and above all slow. This lifeline for Tuzla, a region of some 800,000 people, at some points is little more than a rutted dirt track. It weaves through villages which have been all but destroyed by Serb bombardment. It runs past Mostar, where months of pounding by the Yugoslav army deliberately reduced to rubble most of the centuries-old mosques and churches. An olive green US army bridge now spans the River Neretva, replacing one of the old stone Turkish bridges, Mostar's trademark, which was knocked out by Serb mortars. Croat militia men control more check points on the road than their mainly Moslem Bosnian counterparts. They have set up a kitchen table in front of the ruins of Zitomislici, a 16th century Serbian Orthodox monastery, blown up last year. The guards barely look at the passing cars in an apparent sign of confidence that they are in control of this vital route. 'This is Croatia, from here to the Adriatic,' says one closely cropped soldier in a grey uniform. 'It always has been Croatia,' he adds, dismissing the Bosnian forces on the grounds as too lightly armed. Rows of freshly dug graves fill parks in Breza, a mostly Moslem town in the heart of Bosnia. In anticipation of further Serb bombardments, logs have been used to cover windows not already shattered in the relentless attacks. Villagers haul sacks of flour donated by international relief organisations. Moslem children ask the passing convoys for sweets. Refugees crowded into houses wave glumly at the lorries. Some sell knitted socks. They are tired and undernourished. Many have scabies. The blown-up mosques testify to the destruction of their culture. The route grows narrow in central Bosnia, running through remote mountain passes to avoid Serb artillery and front-lines. Traffic jams are frequent as 10-tonne aid lorries slip off the road or get stuck in the mud. It can take 24 hours to reach Tuzla from the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, a stretch of only 90 miles. Tempers flare as vehicles queue up along the winding trail. A Bosnian lorry driver pulls a gun on a Danish relief worker who asks him to back up. Some locally hired aid trucks have seen better days. But they slog through the rivulets and pools of mud. One driver has been stuck overnight waiting for someone to tow his petrol tanker. 'I can't leave because someone may steal the oil,' he says. He appears pathetically grateful as he is offered an apple and a packet of cigarettes. The lorries must drive at full speed outside Kladanj, where Serb fighters bombard the road to Tuzla. It is dubbed 'bomber alley'. Soldiers wearing the Bosnian fleur-de-lys advise people to drive quickly. Helmet and flak jacket are needed for the last stretch to Tuzla within easy reach of Serb guns. The industrial city is almost a reservation, cut off from the outside world except for one road. Serb and Croat blockades have stopped almost all traffic but relief lorries. On the return trip to Belgrade, at a check-point in UN Sector West some 50 miles east of Zagreb, Croat policemen offer coffee. 'Tell them to come over for some ham and Easter cakes,' orders one policeman. It is unclear to whom he is referring. 'The Jordanians whose checkpoint divides you from the Serbs?' he is asked. 'No, silly, they don't eat pork. Invite the Serbs over for cake.' With some trepidation the Serb policemen are told that they were invited for an Easter celebration with their Croat neighbours. 'Hello neighbour,' he bellows over the walkie-talkie. 'Thanks for the invitation. We'll come over.' 'You bring the beer,' said a Serb militia man. From there it is down the abandoned Zagreb-Belgrade motorway, once the major route joining Europe with the Middle East. It has been a three-day journey back from Tuzla through the former Yugoslavia. At the roadside just outside Belgrade there is a sign: 'Tuzla 70km'.</p>

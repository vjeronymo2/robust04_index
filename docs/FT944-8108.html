			<p>941122 FT  22 NOV 94 / Dole disowns Helms remarks on abilities of president Senator Robert Dole and other senior Republicans have distanced themselves from weekend comments by Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina that President Bill Clinton was unfit to be US commander-in-chief and that this view was shared by leading members of the military. Mr Dole said that, whatever reservations he may have held earlier about the president, 'he's up to the job now.' Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah said that the president had 'been doing better for a while' and that it was incumbent to support the commander-in-chief, whoever it was. Mr Helms, probably the most right-wing member of the Senate, is likely to take over as chairman of the foreign relations committee. He has already threatened to make trouble for the president's foreign policy if a vote on the Gatt treaty is not postponed until next year. His weekend interview drew an instant rebuttal from General John Shalikashvili, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and an even more incendiary reaction from Mr Leon Panetta, White House chief of staff. Mr Panetta described Mr Helms as an extremist with 'reckless' views and recalled his long support for apartheid in South Africa. His remarks, he said, sent 'terrible signals' to US enemies overseas, to US servicemen and 'to kids in our country who are taught to respect the president'.</p>

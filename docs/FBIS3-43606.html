			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dakar, 11 Jan (AFP) -- Leaders from 14 African  nations agreed in principle here late Monday to the devaluation  of their common currency, the CFA franc, but reached no formal  accord, authoritative sources reported. They said heads of  state and government had endorsed the idea of a 50 percent  devaluation of the CFA franc, a largely West African currency  pegged to the French franc. But in return they called for  stronger compensatory measures than were being proposed by  either the International Monetary Fund or France, as one western  source said many of the countries were unprepared for such a  devaluation.    After meeting for six hours behind closed doors, sources  said  the discussions broke off at 10:30 P.M. (2230 GMT) and would  resume early Tuesday.    The devaluation rate will be the same for all of the 14  countries in the Franc Zone, with specific financial measures  applied to each country to offset the consequences, the sources  said. Among the main measures called for are loans to help  cushion the effect on imports, especially basic goods, which are  expected to flood the market after devaluation. In addition  delegates here urged the suppression or reduction in each of the  14 countries' debts, in particular with France, their main donor  country. In addition, they are reported to have called for an  unspecified amount of financial aid for businesses to offset  higher salaries that will become necessary by a fall in  individual buying power.    As the meeting broke up late Monday, there were no details  of  any specific figures, but aid to businesses would also help  reduce debts and refill each country's coffers. But one donor  told AFP many of the 14 nations were unprepared for the effects  of such a devaluation. "The spectre of devaluation, which has  lain dormant since last August, has arrived without African  leaders really believing it would happen and before they were  able to take the necessary measures to accompany it," he said.  And other Western sources said only the Ivory Coast [Cote  d'Ivoire], which had already declared itself in favour of a  devaluation, had come to the meeting well-prepared, armed with  facts and figures. The other countries were forced to outbid  their neighbors in a scramble for increased financial  compensation.    The current parity between the French franc and the CFA unit  has not been changed since 1948. One French franc is worth 50  CFA francs, or currently about 294 CFA francs to the US dollar.    Monday's agreement in principle has come after pressure from  the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has insisted on a  devaluation in return for help with structural adjustment  programmes.    The move would increase the price of imports, on which CFA  franc countries are largely dependent, and open the way for more  exports. Of 14 Franc Zone members, the only one likely to reap  immediate benefit from devaluation is major coffee and cocoa  exporter Ivory Coast, experts said. While devaluation would  favour exports, regional leaders have argued that African goods  face weak demand on international markets, thereby nullifying  any likely gain from the initiative.    Attending the summit are heads of state or government from  Benin, Burkina-Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad,  Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Mali, Mauritania,  Niger, Senegal, and Togo and the Comoros. They were joined  Monday after three hours of talks, by IMF Director General  Michel Camdessus and French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin,  as well as the finance ministers from the 14 participating  countries.</p>

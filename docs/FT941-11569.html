			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sprint registers record profits Shares in Sprint, the third-largest US long-distance telecommunications group, rose on Wall Street yesterday after the company reported a sharp profits advance. Strong growth in long-distance and local telephone volume lifted income from continuing operations 63 per cent in the fourth quarter to Dollars 190m, on revenues of Dollars 2.98bn, up 10 per cent. The results were a record for Sprint, as was the Dollars 11.4bn in revenues it reported for the year as a whole. Full-year operating earnings totalled Dollars 687m, up from Dollars 452m in 1992, but the figure does not include the Dollars 206m non-recurring after-tax charges Sprint took during the year to cover restructurings, tax law changes and the merger with Centel, also of the US. During the fourth quarter, Sprint said its long distance operating income grew by 26 per cent to Dollars 133m, with revenues up 7 per cent to Dollars 1.6bn and long distance use also up 7 per cent. Among the new products introduced by Sprint recently is the Voice Foncard, a voice-activated calling card that allows users to make a call by speaking into the telephone rather than pushing buttons. Sprint's local business was also buoyant in the fourth quarter, with operating income rising 28 per cent to Dollars 251m on revenues of Dollars 1.08bn, up from Dollars 989m a year earlier. Sprint shares rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 37 1/8 in New York.</p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Israeli budget faces tough time in parliament ISRAELI'S finance minister, Mr Abraham Shohat, has defied critics and presented a budget to parliament which emphasises cutting the budget deficit rather than public works spending to cut unemployment. The 1993 budget proposes an increase in spending on infrastructure and education, tax cuts and a fall in spending on public housing projects, mainly in the occupied territories. The Dollars 38.4bn budget is intended to reflect the reordering of national priorities under the new Labour government. The budget deficit is equivalent to 3.2 per cent of GDP, compared with 6.2 per cent in the 1992 budget proposal. 'I hope we have the wisdom and the strength to pass the budget without increasing the deficit,' said Mr Shohat. Several ministers and MPs have criticised the budget, saying it does not do enough to cut unemployment. They have argued for heavier spending on public works projects rather than cutting the budget deficit. As it appears now, unless job-creating measures are introduced, Mr Shohat will not obtain a majority in parliament for the budget. The budget comes up for a first reading next week, and it must be approved by January 1, the start of the new budget year. Unemployment, which has risen in each of the past six years, is running at 11 per cent. According to treasury forecasts, this trend will be reversed in 1993, coming down to 9 per cent by 1995. The main cause of growing unemployment has been the huge increase in the workforce because of immigration from the former Soviet Union. The budget forecasts that inflation will stabilise at about 9 per cent next year. In addition, it expects business activity will grow at 4 per cent, less than in the previous two years, mainly because of the sharp cuts in government spending on housing.</p>

			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Food &amp; Drink (The Flavours of Switzerland): Nice, but is the price right? - Jill James unscrews a few bottles of Swiss wine IN THE Cafe Torrent, vigneron Rene Cottier is discussing the grape harvest: 'It's of medium quantity and we cut a lot of fruit off the vines this year. We are aiming for quality, not quantity.' More coffees are ordered. In his blue check shirt, corduroy trousers and mud-caked boots, Cottier looks as if he is playing the part of a French vigneron delivering the standard patter. But Cottier is a Swiss and the economics of a Swiss vineyard, even in a recession, are the envy of the wine world. For a start the Swiss do not export their wine, they drink most of it themselves - a noble effort since most is from the undistinguished Chasselas grape. Transport costs are minimal too. Many consumers travel to the vineyard to buy by the case. And Swiss drinkers are prepared to pay Pounds 9 to Pounds 12 a bottle for something fairly ordinary. But, as Rene Cottier supervised the end of the harvest last autumn in the steeply banked vineyards at Yvorne, near Vevey, in the Vaud canton, he must have been a little worried, for the success of Swiss wine owes a great deal to the fact that growers have lived in a protected market. And that is changing. Already the Swiss government has lifted quotas on red wine imports and imposed yield restrictions on growers. Meanwhile, domestic consumption is falling. Cottier is realistic enough to know that he will almost certainly get a lower price this year. But he is justly proud of his product - particularly his Clos du Rocher, grand Cru Suisse, bottled at nearby Obrist - and he remains optimistic about what he produces. Paul Baumann, the chef d'exploitation, or oenologist, at Obrist was expecting last autumn's Clos Du Rocher to leave the cellar at SFr19.40 (Pounds 8.70) a bottle (including tax). This seems a high price for those of us who live in the UK and are accustomed to taking our pick of decent wine from the other side of the world for less than Pounds 5. But the Swiss expect to sell it at that price  -and in screw-top bottles. 'We are convinced it keeps better,' said Baumann. Wine aesthetes will be glad to know that the red has a cork and not a screw-top. Although the Chasselas has spread over most of the Vaud - some 80 per cent - it is only fair to mention that other plantings have met with some success, notably the Pinot Noir and the Gamay. Certain soils are also suited to the Pinot Gris, the Pinot Blanc and the Muller-Thurgau. But the question growers and merchants may soon have to face is: why should you buy it at all? There is no burning reason why you should, but sipped quietly in the many excellent bars and cafes while you are on holiday it is as good an entree into the region's discreet charm as anything. Rarity - or novelty value - is another reason for giving it a try. In the Vaud, particularly, varied flavours are an exceptional feature of wine growing. The gout de terroir goes from restrained to heavily pronounced because of the nature of the soil. For those who would like the fruit to predominate in their glass of Chasselas good examples are: Luins, Vinzel, Coteaux de Vincy, Villette, Epesses, St Saphorin and Bonvillars. Those with more earthy palates may favour Fechy, Lutry, Calamin, Chardonne, Vevey, Yvorne, Ollon, Bex, Cotes de l'Orbe and Vully. Finally, for those who would like something more harmonious and well-balanced, Mont-sur-Rolle, Dezaley, Villeneuve and Aigle are worthwhile.

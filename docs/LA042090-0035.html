			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL;  </P> <P> UPSET OR NOT, SOUTHWEST CLAIMS ANOTHER VICTIM, TOPPLES MONTGOMERY  </P> <P> Southwest's baseball team is tired of having the word "upset" attached to its  victories. But for now, the unranked and unheralded Raiders will settle for it.  </P> <P> Thursday in a Metro Conference game, Southwest upset seventh-ranked and host  Montgomery, 3-1, making the top of the league standings a crowded place to be.  </P> <P> "Sure it bothers me that people are calling these upsets," said Southwest Coach  Tom Hernandez. "We're beating good teams, but we have the talent. I'm very  happy with the way they're performing."  </P> <P> And for good reason. It is the second time this week Southwest has met a  formidable opponent and come out a winner -- Tuesday it knocked off  eighth-ranked Sweetwater, 9-5.  </P> <P> For Montgomery, is was a giant and costly step backward. The Aztecs (12-6, 4-2)  began the week undefeated in league, but dropped a 2-1 decision to 10th-ranked  Hilltop Tuesday.  </P> <P> "The bottom line is that the best team won today," said Manny Hermosillo,  Montgomery coach.  </P> <P> Southwest loaded the bases in the sixth with the score tied, 1-1. But relief  pitcher Luis Arroyo got the next batter to hit into a force out, then  registered a strikeout and another ground ball out to end the threat.  </P> <P> "I wasn't worried," Hernandez said. "We have been able to play catch-up a lot."  </P> <P> And so in the seventh, Hernandez wasn't surprised when Ernie Negrete led off  with a single to right, moved to second on a groundout and scored the winning  run on Carlos Sanchez' RBI single to center. Rafael Padilla walked and a balk  moved Sanchez and Padilla to third and second, and Sanchez scored on David  Silva's sacrifice fly.  </P> <P> Especially impressive was the seven-inning, two-hit performance of sophomore  Salvador Sanchez (3-2).  </P> <P> "He was awesome," Hernandez said. "We're hoping he'll stay healthy."  </P> <P> Southwest improved to 7-10, 5-1.  </P> <P> In other Metro Conference games:  </P> <P> Castle Park 3, Sweetwater 1 -- Benji Gil went the distance and threw a  four-hitter for Castle Park (13-8, 4-2) against eighth-ranked Sweetwater, which  lost its second game this week to an unranked team. Raul Sanchez and Larry Meza  combined for a five-hitter for Sweetwater (2-4, 14-6).  </P> <P> Hilltop 17, Bonita Vista 4 -- Chad Mosher went three for four with two triples,  three runs scored and three RBIs, and Sergio Guzman had a triple, two RBIs and  scored twice to lead 10th-ranked Hilltop (14-5, 5-1). The Barons are 8-10, 2-4.  </P> <P> City Harbor League  </P> <P> Clairemont 17, Christian 2 -- James Gertenslager went two for five with four  RBIs including a three-run homer and Antoine Henry went three for five with two  RBIs and two runs scored for Clairemont (11-8, 4-2).  </P> <P> St. Augustine 4, Marian Catholic 3 -- Mike Bryant's two-run homer in the fifth  inning was the deciding blow for St. Augustine. Marian is 5-11, 1-6.  </P> <P> City Western League  </P> <P> Mission Bay 11, Kearny 6 -- Marlin Gardinera had four hits and two RBIs and Pat  Benancourt picked up a victory for Mission Bay. Kearny is 7-11, 1-5.  </P> <P> City Eastern  </P> <P> Patrick Henry 12, Morse 6 -- Greg Altmeyer, who went three for four with three  RBIs, and Dino Distefano, who went two for three with three RBIs, led Patrick  Henry, which scored seven runs in the third. Patrick Henry is 10-9, 4-3.  </P> <P> Mira Mesa 8, Serra 1 -- Marc Nielsen threw a four-hitter to pick up his fifth  win without a loss. Lee McAfee hit a three-run homer in the fourth for  top-ranked Mira Mesa (16-2, 5-1).  </P> <P> City Central  </P> <P> Hoover 8, Madison 2 -- Disi Jacobs went two for four including a two-run  triple, Joe Campbell had two hits and two RBIs and Roger Blake had two hits and  two RBIs for Hoover (6-11, 1-4). Madison fell to 8-9 and 3-3.  </P> <P> Crawford 2, Lincoln 1 -- With the bases loaded and a 3-2 count, Chris Townsend  swung at a pitch over his head and hit a ground rule double, driving home pinch  runner Anthony Sorrell and Bashiri Cooper to lift the Colts, 13-4, 6-1. Winning  pitcher Salvador Vidrios (5-2) struck out seven and allowed four hits. Lincoln  is 5-11, 1-5.  </P> <P> Coastal League  </P> <P> Julian 2, Santa Fe Christian 1 -- Travis Denmark hit a one-out, bases-loaded  single in the bottom of the seventh inning for Julian (10-4, 4-1). Denmark  (6-3) also pitched, striking out 10 and allowing only two hits.  </P> <P> Nonleague  </P> <P> San Diego 5, Pt. Loma 3 -- Winning pitcher Kian Sly homered to lead the Cavers.  Matt Ray led Pt. Loma (10-10) with two doubles and a single.  </P> <P> Coronado 5, University City 1 -- Jason Fledderjohn went two for two with an RBI  and James Skaalen won his fourth game without a loss for the Islanders (12-6,  5-2). University City is 5-12, 1-4. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE  </P></p>

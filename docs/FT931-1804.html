			<p>930323 FT  23 MAR 93 / German politicians threatened by series of scandals GERMANY'S battered political establishment, facing a wave of public indifference and voter apathy, is being further undermined by a series of petty scandals threatening the good names of its leading politicians. None of the offences would on its own seem likely to cause a resignation, in spite of the enthusiasm with which they are pursued by the German media. Yet together they have knocked the political establishment several points further down the scale of public popularity, and could yet cause heads to roll. Top of the hit list are Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the opposition Social Democrats, and Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union. Close behind comes Mr Gunther Krause, the transport minister whom motorists love to hate for threatening to introduce a motorway tax. He has been accused of claiming a social security subsidy for employing a cleaning lady. Bringing up the rear are Mr Max Streibl, prime minister of wealthy Bavaria, a close ally of Mr Waigel, and Mr Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader to Mr Engholm in the SPD and prime minister of Saarland. Mr Streibl took a free holiday to Brazil with a leading Bavarian businessman; Mr Lafontaine was accused of employing as his bodyguard a well-known criminal with gangland connections. Most of them deny their alleged offences, or if they admit them, insist that they were pecadilloes of the greatest political insignificance. Yet all are acutely aware that less than three months ago Mr Jurgen Mollemann, the former economics minister and aspiring leader of the Free Democratic party, lost his political head in just such a second-rate scan-dal. Mr Engholm's scandal is perhaps the most complex. He is accused of - and firmly denies - knowing about how close associates paid cash to an official working for their Christian Democrat opponents in Schleswig-Holstein, after the official had exposed a dirty tricks campaign by the CDU against Mr Engholm. The sum of money is modest - DM40,000 (Dollars 24,000) - and Mr Engholm's offence is no more than denying any knowledge of the payment. Yet his public popularity has plummeted in recent days, and his party colleagues seem less than enthusiastic about rallying to his defence. Mr Waigel is the latest to stumble into the line of fire, accused of protecting a Bavarian meat trader from being brought to court for allegedly claiming export subsidies illegally. Big guns were brought out yesterday to defend him, including a firm statement of support from Mr Helmut Kohl, the chancellor.</p>

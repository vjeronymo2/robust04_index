			<p><P> May 22, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WEISS NAMED ATLANTA COACH  </P> <P> Bob Weiss, who won only 59 of 164 games in two seasons as head coach at San  Antonio, became the new coach of the Atlanta Hawks today.  </P> <P> Hawks President Stan Kasten announced the choice at a news conference at the  Omni, saying he was "very, very confident that this is the right choice for  this team at this time."  </P> <P> Weiss replaces Mike Fratello, who resigned last month after the Hawks finished  the season at 41-41 and missed the NBA playoffs for the first time since 1985.  </P> <P> Weiss was fired by San Antonio after the 1987-88 season and most recently was  an assistant with the Orlando Magic.  </P> <P> Kasten said over the weekend that Weiss and New Jersey Nets Vice President  Willis Reed were the two finalists for the job. Reed withdrew on Monday and was  named senior vice president of the Nets.  </P> <P> By missing the playoffs, the Hawks won a berth in the NBA draft lottery but had  only one Ping-Pong ball among 66 in the drawing and finished with the 11th pick  in the first round of the draft.  </P> <P> After his retirement as a player in 1977, Weiss spent two years as an assistant  to Gene Shue with the San Diego Clippers. In 1980, he became an assistant with  the Dallas Mavericks, where he stayed until he was named head coach of the  Spurs in 1986.  </P></p>

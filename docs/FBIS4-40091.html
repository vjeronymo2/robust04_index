			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Irina Litvinova: "Fate of Latvian `Noncitizens' </F> Explained. But It Seems This Will Not Make Their Lives Any  Easier"]    [Text] Fifty Latvian Saeima deputies have decided the fate  of the hundreds of thousands of residents who are uncertain of  their future. The law on citizenship has passed its second  reading.    This means that conceptual changes are no longer possible,  and at the third reading (expected to be held at an emergency  session during the summer parliamentary recess) only editorial  amendments that do not alter the essence of the law will be  possible.    This long-awaited law -- Latvia is the only republic in the  former Union where such a document has not been adopted -- has  undergone significant changes since its first reading in the  fall. Proposals have mainly been submitted by the  national-radical faction of the the Latvian National  Independence Movement [LNNK] (as is well known, the LNNK was  victorious in the recent municipal elections). The new articles  are notable for their ethnic protectionism -- for instance, the  "priority" group of those who can apply for naturalization  before 1 January 1996 includes not only ethnic Latvians and  Livonians, but also Estonians and Lithuanians. Attempts to  ascertain in what way they are better than Belarusians or Poles  have proved fruitless -- politicians have provided no sensible  explanations, citing "Baltic unity."    The first people who can claim Latvian citizenship are the  spouses of citizens (if married for more than 10 years).    The list of those who cannot become Latvian citizens under  any circumstances is very long -- these include criminal  elements, people spreading fascist or communist ideas (in the  period since 4 May 1990, when Latvian idependence was  proclaimed), KGB and other special service staffers, and  demobilized Soviet Army personnel who have remained to reside  permanently in the republic. I would note that the demands on  "noncitizens" are far stricter than those on "citizens": The  latter can have been in the security services or served in the  Soviet Army, or leaders of the criminal fraternity -- it will  not affect their citizenship.    Those given "priority" will not receive automatic  citizenship. They also have to meet a residence qualification.  They will have to take a test of their knowledge of the Latvian  Constitution, the republic's history, and the Latvian language.  They must have a legal source of income.    It would be nice to think that all the tests and checks  would  be objective and impartial, but the current arbitrary civil  service practice at local level raises doubts -- the  arbitrariness of departments and clerks have been recognized by  international experts working in Latvia.    As of 1 January 1996 it will be time for those born in  Latvia  to apply to be naturalized. Age lists will be drawn up and,  deputies believe, by the year 2000 anyone "over 30" should have  submitted an application. After this date everyone else can  apply for citizenship, but...not more than 0.1 percent of the  total number of citizens may apply each year. Recent statistics  show that Latvians currently make up 54.2 percent of the  republic's total population. But the initiators of the hard line  in the citizenship law -- such as Deputy Aristids Lambergs, for  instance -- believe that this figure should go beyond the  70-percent mark.    Latvia is making no secret of the fact that it would like  the  fall Council of Europe session to consider the Baltic state's  admission to this international organization. The citizenship  law and the criticism of it by Max van der Stoel, CSCE  commissioner for ethnic minority affairs, have held up this  process. The assessment that the new document receives from  experts and European politicians is something awaited by both  the Latvian authorities and by Latvian "noncitizens" who are  dissatisfied with it.</p>

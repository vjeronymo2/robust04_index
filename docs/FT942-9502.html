			<p>940516 FT  16 MAY 94 / EU seeks even-handed policy towards Russia and Ukraine The European Union will today make a start at trying to forge a more even-handed strategy toward Russia and Ukraine, whose neighbourhood rivalry remains a source of instability on the continent. Barring last-minute objections, EU foreign ministers in Brussels are likely to give the go-ahead to a new 'partnership' agreement with Russia whose ambitious goal is a common free-trade zone by the end of the century. However, in a sign of 'new thinking', the EU is balancing its Russia policy with a deeper engagement in Ukraine, whose nuclear arsenal and collapsing economy make it the regional danger spot. Ministers will today examine a European Commission paper which calls for a host of new initiatives to strengthen political co-operation and overhaul the command economy in Ukraine. The plan recommends Ecu100m (Pounds 79m) in emergency food aid and measures to improve nuclear safety, particularly the dismantling of the Chernobyl plant, which experts estimate could cost between Ecu300m and Ecu500m. Chernobyl funding will be a key topic at the Group of Seven industrialised countries' summit in Naples in July. Ministers may baulk at the Commission's food aid plan because of conflicting evidence of food shortages and worries that emergency shipments could distort local agricultural markets. Some countries may also delay approval of the documents in favour of waiting for a deeper analysis of the Ukrainian political economy. A senior EU diplomat said Russia had modified its earlier resistance to having the EU bolster its relations with Ukraine. But Brussels had to tread carefully in the light of Russia's (and its own) insistence that economic aid should be linked to Ukraine's meeting its pledge to ratify the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The EU recently completed a 'partnership' agreement with Ukraine which is slightly less generous than the EU-Russia pact now virtually complete. Ministers are weighing an invitation to Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk to attend a signing ceremony. The EU-Russia partnership pact is likely to be approved, provided ministers agree to settle the two controversies which have plagued negotiations over the past 18 months. These are the EU's treatment of Russian uranium exports and Moscow's treatment of European banks operating in Russia. France, the EU's largest producer as well as consumer of enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, has been worried about being undercut by Russian exports. A new safeguards regime operating until 1997 may ease French concerns. Member states are less enthusiastic about the banking offer because it restricts EU banks to no more than 12 per cent of the total capitalisation of the Russian banking system, with Moscow offering a non-committal review after five years. But Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, believes it is the best deal on offer. Agreement would pave the way for Mr Boris Yeltsin to stage a high-profile visit to western Europe, possibly via an invitation to attend the European summit in Corfu next month.</p>

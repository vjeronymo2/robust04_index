			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / International Company News: Metra improves at eight-month stage METRA, the Finnish industrial group, reported yesterday a FM56m (Dollars 12.1m) loss for the first eight months of the year, a marked improvement on the FM201m deficit suffered for the same period of 1991. The group expects to make a profit for the whole of the year, compared with a FM203m loss for the last financial year. Net sales for the first eight months were Fm3.676bn, 18 per cent down from the FM4.460bn recorded on the same period of 1991 as a result of recent divestments. Metra added that sales were expected to reach around FM10bn for the full year. Metra said its sanitary equipment division (Sanitec) had seen a weakening in profits, and net sales had not marched expectations, mainly due to industrial disruption last summer in Germany. The group said profits for the full year in its security division were expected to improve slightly, but still remain unsatisfactory for the year. Its steel operations and caravan division made a loss in the period.</p>

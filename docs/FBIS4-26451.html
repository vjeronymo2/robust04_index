			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Jing Shuzhan (2529 2118 1455) and reporter </F> Jia Yong (6328 3057)]    [Text] Beijing, 18 Jun (XINHUA) -- The second class of Army  cadres of command level and above to study Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, sponsored by the  National Defense University under the Central Military  Commission [CMC] and the General Political Department, ended  today. So far, a total of 154 senior Army cadres have attended  the classes.    To assemble senior cadres from the whole Army to study  Volume  3 of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping and discuss  current major issues in the country and the army's modernization  drive was an important measure adopted by the CMC in order to  further implement the strategic task of arming the whole army  with the theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics. Jiang Zemin, Liu Huaqing, Zhang Zhen, and  other CMC leaders attended discussions on two occasions with  members of the first and second study classes.    According to a briefing, members of the study classes  diligently studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics in the light of the  realities in the work of each unit or department. They  discussed in particular the theme of Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, Deng Xiaoping's  theory on socialist market economy, the building of spiritual  civilization under the condition of market economy, and the  Army's ideological and political work. Through study, members  deepened their understanding of Deng Xiaoping's scientific  exposition on the essence of socialism, grasped a deeper insight  of the intrinsic meaning of socialism, and enhanced their  consciousness and steadfastness in implementing the party's  basic line. Meanwhile, they obtained a better understanding of  Deng Xiaoping's theory on socialist market economy -- especially  the theory's formulation, contents, and great significance --  thereby raising their awareness of safeguarding the overall  interests and of subordinating themselves to the overall  interests. They also further clarified their ideas for work and  improved their leadership quality. It is understood that,  inspired by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory, members of the study  class wrote more than 100 theses with keen insight.</p>

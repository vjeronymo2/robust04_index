			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Regular" interview with Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik by </F> correspondent Martin Bartisek; place and date not  given--recorded]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Bartisek] A new entity has  emerged on our political scene--the New Slovakia movement.  Honorary Chairman Rudolf Mosny has proposed the abolition of  the Ministry for Administration and Privatization of National  Property. What do you think about his proposal? It is possible  to assume, to a certain degree, that it was put forward by a man  of some experience. Moreover, he says that, in our country,  privatization has become a political instrument. I am, in fact,  asking two questions.    [Moravcik] I agree with both of them. As far as turning  privatization into a political issue is concerned, we spoke out  about this already some time ago, and we are striving to  depoliticize privatization. From this viewpoint, it is possible  to agree with this idea. However, as far as the activities of  our Cabinet are concerned, we strive to respect the above  principle strictly--that is, we would not like privatization to  be an arena of political influence by individual parties, to be  carried out so that supporters of one or the other party gain  some unfair advantages. This will have a very negative impact.  If privatization is being linked to policy, it should be only  economic policy. This is our aim. This means that privatization  should support the Cabinet's economic policy.    The measure we adopted today is aimed at this--we proposed  releasing 3.5 billion korunas of the money we gained or are  going to gain through privatization of national property. We  want to release this money to give an impetus to the development  of our economy.    [Bartisek] However, your reaction to the call for the  abolition of the Ministry for Privatization was positive.    [Moravcik] At present, there are still reasons for the  existence of the ministry, given the current concept of  privatization as outlined in the Privatization Act. If we  change this concept, which is defined by the current norms, we  might even imagine abolishing the Ministry for Privatization.  It is, of course, possible to discuss this issue. However, the  implementation of this idea before the elections can be  excluded. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / BT hits back at US company THE DISPUTE between BT and American Telephone and Telegraph over wholesale prices for transatlantic phone calls is irrelevant to BT's application to break into the US market, the company said yesterday. In a petition filed at the Federal Communications Commission, the US regulator, BT said there was 'no basis' for AT&amp;T's 'unprecedented' proposal to link the issue to its US application.</p>

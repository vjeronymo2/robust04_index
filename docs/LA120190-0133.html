			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTE GROWS OVER SHOOTING BY BORDER PATROLMAN  </P> <P> A controversy surrounding the U.S. Border Patrol shooting of a 15-year-old  Mexican boy intensified Friday, when the police in Calexico accused Mexican  lawmen of refusing them access to the boy and otherwise thwarting their  investigation.  </P> <P> At a news conference Friday, Calexico Police Chief Leslie Ginn also charged  that Mexican police withheld other vital evidence -- including the 9-millimeter  bullet that injured the youth, the teenager's clothing and various police and  ambulance reports.  </P> <P> Mexican authorities denied the charges and explained that the youth's slow  recovery had prompted doctors to forbid a police interview.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Calexico police said the Border Patrol agent who shot the boy on  Nov. 18 did so when the youth, perched atop the border fence, prepared to throw  a rock at the agent.  </P> <P> The victim, Eduardo Garcia Zamores, who is recuperating in a Mexicali hospital,  denied he had a rock or made threats against the agent, according to Marco E.  Lopez, the San Diego attorney who is representing the youth in a $9-million  civil negligence claim filed this week against the Border Patrol. Four  witnesses have supported his version.  </P> <P> The Border Patrol has declined to discuss the case or identify the agent.  </P> <P> The case has ignited protests at the Mexicali-Calexico border, one of which  resulted Wednesday in a nine-hour shutdown of the international port and a halt  of the flow of commerce and travelers.  </P> <P> The agent has been reassigned to other duties pending the outcome of the case.  </P></p>

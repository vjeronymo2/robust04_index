			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Survey of Executive Cars (1): Traditional concept challenged  -Sales could dip as executives opt for smaller, more flexible - but still well-equipped - cars The world's executive car industry has entered a new age of uncertainty. Even the traditional concept of the 'executive' car, as being a large, well-equipped, swift and silent saloon carrying up to five people on business, is under challenge. If predictions by the Economist Intelligence Unit, DRI McGraw Hill and other forecasters prove correct, sales of this category of vehicle in Europe will decline by up to one-fifth between now and the end of the century. In unit terms that would mean a sales drop of more than 130,000 units annually from the nearly 840,000 sold last year - a considerable blow to specialists in the sector such as Germany's Mercedes-Benz. In this scenario, part of the decline will be caused by environmentally-motivated taxation and other legislation encouraging users to opt for smaller - but still well-equipped - cars. Yet more will be accounted for by users opting for different types of vehicle. They will still be capable of performing the same basic function. But they will allow greater flexibility of use, or simply allow a user or owner to make a more overt 'statement' about his or her lifestyle. Within these categories, by far the fastest growth is forecast for the 'MPVs' (multi-purpose vehicles) which most of the leading car makers are rushing to bring to market. Typified by the Renault Espace in Europe and Ford's new Windstar and Chrysler's Voyager in North America, they have seven or eight seats but drive like cars and can be as well-equipped as any saloon. The EIU's own forecast is that their European sales will more than triple to well over half-a-million by the end of the decade, compared with 142,000 last year. Peugeot and Fiat are launching a joint venture vehicle in the sector, as are Ford and Volkswagen. Four-wheel-drive 'lifestyle' leisure vehicles such as Land Rover's Discovery are also providing an acceptable alternative to the conventional executive car, although there is much more caution among forecasters as to whether, by the late 1990s, they may turn out to have proved a relatively short-term 'cult.' Both types of vehicle reflect the breaking up of the world's vehicle market into an ever-growing number of niches made possible by flexible manufacturing systems and working processes. But the industry's uncertainty is being caused by other, no less important factors than consumer preference for its products: For the big Japanese car makers such as Toyota, Nissan and Honda, whose executive and luxury car brands - Lexus, Infiniti and Acura, respectively - are produced entirely in Japan, the strength of the yen is causing severe pricing difficulties in overseas markets, particularly North America, which absorbs more executive and luxury cars than anywhere else in the world. Even little more than a year ago, many industry analysts believed the Japanese makers' advance into the executive and luxury sectors would prove all but unstoppable. Not only has the advance been slowed for hard financial reasons; some analysts are starting to maintain that the Japanese industry is running out of impetus in the key areas of design and development - 'some Japanese companies seem to be in trouble, not just financially but in their ability consistently to design new models which customers find really attractive,' maintain Booz Allen consultants Mark Snowdon and Norbert Wittemann in a new paper on the future of automotive innovation. Japan's problems have coincided with a resurgence of North America's industry which has occurred with a rapidity and strength that few would have predicted at the start of the 1990s. At that time Chrysler was nearly bankrupt and General Motors was in crisis resolved only by a boardroom coup. This year the collective earnings of Chrysler, GM and Ford are likely to top Dollars 10bn and with a highly competitive dollar, they are looking for direct exports in the executive sector as well as supplying the market with products made by their European subsidiaries. Ford, for example, is tapping Europe's growing executive coupe market with the US-designed and built Probe. With a growing array of sophisticated vehicles like the Lincoln Town Car, the indigenous US car makers are recapturing ground previously lost to the prestige Japanese makes. Sales of prestigious European marques like Mercedes and BMW have begun a recovery in North America. 'The Japanese under-estimated the speed and ability of US companies to respond to their problems. Meanwhile, their own responses to the high yen and years of depressed financial performance have been inadequate, leaving them vulnerable to further inroads once American producers modernise their cars,' according to Ms Maryann Keller, a well-known motor industry analyst with Furman Selz. Despite their revived fortunes, the US 'big three' insist that they will not rest on their laurels and that much must still be done if they are not once again to be left behind as Japan's economic fortunes recover and the challenge from other Asian countries grows. Some of the actions in train are set to have a structural impact on the European industry. Ford, in one of the biggest reorganisations in its history, is forming itself into several global product divisions. Ultimate responsibility for the design and development of large cars, for example, is to rest in the US, while European operations will lead small and medium car development. Thus, while Ford chairman Mr Alex Trotman promises that Jaguars will be designed mainly in the UK, it has nevetheless become part of the 'world' large cars division. The landscape of the executive car industry in Europe has changed in other ways in recent months. Mercedes, already seeking to escape Germany's high costs with car and four-wheel-drive plants in the US and Mexico, is further developing its plans to enter the small cars sector with a luxury 'supermini,' and in a radical new joint venture to produce cheap city cars with the Swiss Swatch concern. BMW, in a bold move which turned it, at a stroke, into a 1m units-plus a year group with instant access to wholly complementary front-wheel-drive and four-wheel-drive sectors, has bought up the UK's Rover Group to the chagrin of Rover's Japanese partner, Honda. Now that emotions have calmed, there is talk of possible three-way collaboration between the groups - a development with as yet incalculable potential impact on the shape of the executive car industry. The acquisition provided ammunition for industry analysts who argue that there is a much rationalisation yet to come in the European industry, and that it still has too many players. The collapse of the planned merger between Swedish executive car maker Volvo and Renault of France at the start of this year shows that such a process is likely to be slow and painful. And some of the players, despite heavy losses, make plain that they have no intention of giving up. Fiat, for example, will shortly begin a big relaunch of its Alfa Romeo marque throughout Europe, through an expanded dealer network and with an extensive array of new products. In September it will also be launching an entirely new Lancia executive car, also the precursor to a complete renewal of the Lancia range. If, as some industry analysts maintain, they represent a 'last throw of the dice' to maintain Fiat's long term survival in the executive car industry, then it is a very expensive one. The total investment programmes total more than L40,000bn (Dollars 24.95bn). On car prices, meanwhile, there is pressure from the EU Commission for greater price harmonisation within Europe, as well as a growing awareness by consumers - as highlighted in a study of Japanese, US and European market prices by the Euromotor consultancy - that European prices overall are high compared with other developed markets. The suspicion is growing that consumers are having to foot excessive bills for a European car manufacturing industry still struggling for global competitiveness. It will not easily be allayed.</p>

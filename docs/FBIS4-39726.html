			<p>BFN     [Text] Tallinn, June 09, BNS -- Estonian parliament  Chairman Ulo Nugis, who today announced his readiness to take  over as new head of the government, also said he would not keep  for current Prime Minister Mart Laar a post in his cabinet.    "I don't consider it possible that Mart Laar would be a  minister in my government," Nugis said.    But, he said, adding a mellow tone, Mart Laar is a young man  for whom the heights of life are still ahead. "I still think  that when the current government is replaced, Laar will not be  lost for Estonia as a politician," Nugis said. He mentioned  that a place for Laar could be found in one of the country's  future governments.    The parliament chairman said that if the president now  proposes to him to set up a new Cabinet, it is possible that he  will include the rest of the current ministers in his Cabinet  list.    "To become a prime minister is not my ultimate goal, but it  is a means with which I wish to resolve the government crisis  that has energed in Estonia and avoid splitting of Pro Patria,"  Nugis said at a press conference today.    "Fellow members from the Republican faction of Pro Patria  have made a proposal to me to stand as candidate for the post of  Pro Patria chairman and, as a prime minister candidate, take  upon myself the formation of a new government," Nugis said in  his personal written statement released today. "Let my personal  feelings be left aside at this point, but I take the proposal  made by the Republicans as a task from persons with whom I share  views," he said, adding that shirking responsibility could only  be interpreted as an act of treachery to his ideals.    Nugis said a notion had emerged in the parliament that a  government under Mart Laar cannot continue in power. In his  words the parliament is ready to fail the current government in  a confidence vote regardless of the outcome of the Pro Patria  congress. He said this was also the position of the governing  coalition. When asked how he could be so sure about this, Nugis  said that he as the speaker of the parliament knows well his  fellow MP's.    Article 97 of the Estonian Constitution gives the president  the right to call a new general election at the government's  proposal within three days after a vote of no-confidence in the  government or the prime minister. Observers say it is in  Nugis' interests that no such proposal would come from the  current government, as this would add uncertainty to his  prospects of becoming prime minister.</p>

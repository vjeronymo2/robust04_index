			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: SMELL OF ROSES LURES DOLLARS FROM HUSKIES  </P> <P> Here come the Huskies. There goes $1,026,894.  </P> <P> The University of Washington is about to become the first school to spend more  than $1 million on its Rose Bowl excursion, a 16-day funfest that begins with  the team's arrival in Southern California today.  </P> <P> Among the items under the heading "team and staff" in the Huskies' bowl budget,  as itemized last week by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer:  </P> <P> "Awards (watches): $90,000. . . .  </P> <P> "Dry cleaning, laundry: $10,000. . . .  </P> <P> "Team Christmas party: $9,000. . . .  </P> <P> "Power-lift: $1,750."  </P> <P> The power-lift is the overhead platform Coach Don James uses for viewing  practice sessions.  </P> <P> Add budget: The marching band's share of the million-plus is $181,265, with  $1,000 going for "care of mascot."  </P> <P> The president's office will spend $141,144, which includes a $20,300  "reception-dinner" for donors and regents.  </P> <P> Last add budget: Said Athletic Director Mike Lude: "It's supposed to be a  quality experience for the people who got us where we are."  </P> <P> Said Jim Muldoon, Pacific 10 assistant commissioner: "Our people have always  had the feeling that being in the Rose Bowl is special and people should have a  good time."  </P> <P> Trivia time: Which NFL punter was the victim of the most blocked punts in his  career?  </P> <P> Cutting edge: John Eisenberg of the Baltimore Sun reported from Shreveport,  La., on Maryland's 34-34 tie with Louisiana Tech Saturday:  </P> <P> "It has long been a sporting axiom, of course, that you just never know what's  going to happen when you tee it up in the Poulan Weed Eater Independence Bowl.  The only certainty is that the field will be immaculately groomed."  </P> <P> Road kill: Philadelphia defensive tackle Mike Golic told Greg Logan of Newsday  he was sidetracked more than once during the Eagles' 31-0 victory over Green  Bay Sunday.  </P> <P> Said Golic: "I can't believe how (Eagle defensive end) Reggie (White) was  throwing (Packer tackle Tony) Mandarich around. It was amazing. They're  basically the same size, and Reggie treated him like a toy. I'd start to rush,  and I had to watch to keep from tripping over (Mandarich). It opened up stuff  for the rest of us, but we didn't know where to go because we didn't know where  Reggie would throw his guy."  </P> <P> Sooner, often: The Blair Rasmussen watch continues. In his team's first 22  games, the Denver Nugget center has eight disqualifications. Barring injury,  that pace would take him well beyond the NBA single-season record of 26, set by  Don Meineke of the Fort Wayne Pistons in 1952-53.  </P> <P> Peter May of the Boston Globe wondered: "Is Rasmussen the only Nugget who plays  defense?"  </P> <P> Said Rasmussen: "Well, being the last stand on a lot of two-on-one or  three-on-one situations doesn't help. You try to take the charge, and sooner or  later, you get caught."  </P> <P> Trivia answer: Herman Weaver, 14 blocked punts while with the Detroit Lions  (1970-76) and the Seattle Seahawks (1977-80).  </P> <P> Quotebook: Rookie center Felton Spencer of the Minnesota Timberwolves, after  Coach Bill Musselman had thrown a bar of soap at a chalkboard during halftime  of a recent game: "It could have been worse. He could have shot somebody." TED  BROCK  </P></p>

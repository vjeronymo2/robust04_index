			<p><P> July 17, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> OXNARD TOLD TO PAY $1.95 MILLION TO CONSTRUCTION FIRM;  </P> <P> COURTS: A JUDGE UPHELD AN EARLIER RULING THAT THE CITY VIOLATED A CONTRACT WITH  THE COMPANY HIRED TO BUILD A STORM DRAIN.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge has upheld an earlier ruling that requires the city of  Oxnard to pay a local construction firm $1.95 million for violating a contract  with the company.  </P> <P> A lawyer representing the city had asked Los Angeles County Superior Court  Judge Ronald M. Sohigian to dismiss an arbitration ruling that said Oxnard  breached a contract with B &amp; Sons Construction Inc. of Oxnard.  </P> <P> But Sohigian ruled on Friday that the decision made in arbitration in May by  retired Superior Court Judge Thomas T. Johnson was "supported by substantial  evidence and was not based on an error of law."  </P> <P> Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig said the City Council will consider the judge's  ruling today and decide whether to appeal.  </P> <P> Alan Holmberg, an attorney representing the city of Oxnard in the contract  dispute, said he asked the judge to dismiss the arbitration ruling because he  believes the city should not have to pay nearly $1.2 million in anticipated  profits lost by B &amp; Sons due to damage to the company's reputation.  </P> <P> B &amp; Sons lawyers had argued successfully that the canceled contract damaged  the company's ability to become bonded by insurance companies against failure  to complete government jobs. Government contracts once made up 65% of the  company's business.  </P> <P> Lanny McKay, contract administrator for the company, on Monday criticized  Oxnard officials for trying to renege on the arbitration decision to compensate  the company for canceling the contract. He accused the city of spending  taxpayers' money to delay paying what it owes the company.  </P> <P> Holmberg disagreed, saying the city has a right to oppose the arbitration  decision if it believes the ruling was unfair. The court hearing and the  arbitration were held in Los Angeles because attorneys representing both sides  of the case work in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The dispute began in 1988 when the city offered B &amp; Sons $4.8 million to  build almost three miles of storm drain for water runoff in the 1,600-acre  Northeast Industrial Assessment District in northeast Oxnard. Before the  project could begin, the company discovered that the ground water and soil were  contaminated by petroleum.  </P> <P> The company began working at the site while the city investigated how much it  would cost to clean up the contamination. About six months later, the city  determined that it would have to spend up to $12 million to remove the  contaminants and build a storm drain there.  </P> <P> In December, 1988, when B &amp; Sons refused to work on the contaminated  section without high-cost safety provisions, the city fired the company.  </P> <P> Later, the city hired another company to complete the project and build the  drain in another section of the district.  </P> <P> Johnson ruled during arbitration hearings that the city was liable for damages  because it knew that the area where the drain was to be built was contaminated.  </P> <P> City officials have said that if the money is paid, the cost will be borne by  property owners in the district, where business and industrial parks are to be  built. The city administers the assessment district.  </P></p>

			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Davies outlines recovery strategy RECOVERY is unlikely to be driven by a boost in consumer spending. It will come rather from a revival of investment and an increase in exports, Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, told the conference yesterday. He drew together the elements of the policy package expected by employers from the government. 'The argument for a new, more coherent strategy has been won. The need now is to help the government to decide what to put in it,' said Mr Davies, who called for: A loosening of monetary conditions to speed the process of readjusting personal balance sheets and reducing overhanging debt. 'We would like to see one and preferably two points' off interest rates, he said. Progress in creating a new framework of anti-inflation policy, meaning work towards 'a more independent Bank of England'. The green light for 'some talismanic projects' such as the extension to London Underground's Jubilee Line as part of the government's undertaking to protect capital programmes as far as possible in tomorrow's Autumn Statement. Tighter control of public-sector current expenditure, including a freeze on the government's pay bill. Hard thought from the government on investment allowances, capital gains tax and the uniform business rate to help revive investment. A commitment from the Department of Trade and Industry to make its support for business 'as favourable, as positive and as excellent as those of the best of our competitor countries'. Mr Davies said the UK's economic strategy should be based on free trade, the single market, low inflation, stable financial conditions and sound public finances.</p>

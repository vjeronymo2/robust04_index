			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with unidentified high-ranking Bolivian Army </F> officer by FIDES NEWS AGENCY, ANF; place and date not given,  first part is introduction]    [Text] Military chiefs of the different forces have  recommended that the Bolivian Government should "gradually  eliminate the use of foreign advisers in antinarcotics  enforcement" and thus "guarantee national security and  sovereignty."    "Experts from other countries -- not necessarily from the  United States -- may come here. There is no problem as long as  they abide by national laws and are appropriately authorized.  But it would be good if they could be gradually eliminated in  the short term," said a source close to the Military High  Command. The officer explained, however, that their idea is not  the institutional position.    A high-ranking Army officer close to the Military High  Command agreed to be interviewed by ANF on condition he was not  identified because of "specific regulations, disciplinary  practices, and precepts of the Armed Forces organic law."    [ANF] Are the Bolivian Armed Forces fully capable of  controlling the actions of foreign groups like the DEA in  Bolivia?    [Officer] The Armed Forces are present all over the country  but we are unable to fully cover the entire territory. Military  organizations can temporarily come to Bolivia as long as they  are under the supervision of the Bolivian Armed Forces.    We (the military) are preserving Bolivian national  sovereignty and security in compliance with our constitutional  role. It would worry us if elements (foreign military) were  allowed to move freely (throughout Bolivia).    [ANF] Are the foreign armed elements operating in the  country  subordinated to the Bolivian Armed Forces?    [Officer] We want them to abide by national laws, we do not  want their subordination.    [ANF] How would you label relations between the Armed Forces  and the U.S. military mission?    [Officer] Military relations between U.S. and Bolivian  forces  are absolutely normal.    [ANF] Why are U.S. military advisers -- rather than those  from other countries -- always involved in antinarcotics  enforcement, humanitarian aid, and civic action?    [Officer] We must get all countries involved in the struggle  against trafficking and thus get them to do their share. The  best course of action would be if we used our own means and  capabilities in a national and decisive action against  trafficking with foreign technical advice in some cases, and  with the provision of means we do not have in other cases.    [ANF] Do you believe national sovereignty is likely to be  violated by foreign interests?    [Officer] The presence of U.S. troops in particular is no  threat to national sovereignty because the Armed Forces  follow-up the actions of U.S. personnel that enter the country  to ensure they behave legally and return to their country within  the time established by Congress in some cases and by the  executive branch in others. DEA agents are here on rotational  assignments.    [ANF] The arrival of U.S. military personnel has increased  since last year. Has anything abnormal been detected?    [Officer] All foreign personnel arriving here do so legally  based on bilateral and multilateral agreements. They cannot  just parachute in. Everything is under control, if there were  anything abnormal, the Armed Forces would detect it and report  it to a higher level.    [ANF] When armed foreign personnel arrive under a binational  agreement, to whom do they report during their stay?    [Officer] They obey the agreement. They are not under the  orders of the Armed Forces but we supervise and have liaison  officers in the areas where they work.</p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / World Trade News: Daewoo plant for Poland - Ventures and contracts Daewoo Electronics of South Korea will build its biggest foreign production complex in Poland as part of its strategy to capture 10 per cent of the European market for consumer electronics by 2000. The production site at Pruszkow, 25km west of Warsaw, will manufacture consumer electronic goods, home appliances and electronic components. Production will amount to Dollars 200m in annual sales with 60 per cent of output being exported to the rest of Europe. Construction at Pruszkow, where Daewoo already makes colour televisions, will be completed by 1996. Plans include the annual production of 100,000 washing machines, 200,000 refrigerators and 200,000 car audio systems. Colour television production will be increased from 400,000 to 600,000. It is the second largest recent investment in Europe by a Korean electronics company, following Samsung's decision to build a manufacturing plant in north-east England at a cost of Dollars 700m. Daewoo, which produces VCRs in Northern Ireland and colour televisions, picture tubes and microwave ovens in Lorraine, France, said it selected Poland because of its low-cost skilled labour, good industrial infrastructure, political stability and central location in Europe.</p>

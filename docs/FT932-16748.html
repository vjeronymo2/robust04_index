			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Fishing: No, Robert, it's not like that YOU MUST have heard of A River Runs Through It by now, even if you have not seen the film. It is Hollywood's loving embrace of fly fishing; the one with the poster showing an angler with an old-fashioned hat standing on a rock in a glittering river, with his line irradiated above his head by sunlight bursting through trees. Very evocative. Since that sincere, oh-so-serious Robert Redford brought his treatment of Norman MacLean's piscatorial novella to London, people who have never before exhibited the smallest interest in my obsession have been asking me: 'Is fly fishing really like that?' In considering my reply, I remember the scoffing, the sneering, the moralistic spoutings, the immense ignorance and prejudice I have had to endure from the non-believers over the years. I have been acutely aware that, while golf, gardening, cycling, aerobics, tennis, computer games and a host of other pointless activities are tolerable to the metropolitan mind, fishing is not. It is an aberration. So, I have been moved to sarcasm. Yes, of course - come Saturday I shall be heading north-west from London on the M40 for the Big Blackfoot where I shall pull on my inimitable, battered old hat, take my hickory rod in hand, nod to my similarly-accoutred younger brother and sour-faced dad (taciturn, as befits a minister, but all heart), wade in comfortable old bags into the swift,limpid stream and within, five minutes or so, have a brace of wild, fighting two-pounders on the bank. But this is immature. So, I try to forget the injuries I have suffered, and the fact that it took the advent of a smoothie-chops like Redford to stir an interest in the sport among these backward souls. I say, forcibly: it is nothing like that. There are no rivers like the Big Blackfoot, no trout like these trout. No, you do not feel a deep spiritual oneness with Nature as the water presses against your thighs. Fishing is hard work, full of discomfort and boredom. It rains a lot. There are brief periods of action during which, often as not, everything goes wrong and you want to shoot yourself. For some reason, they find the Redford version more pleasing than the truth according to Fort. There are murmurs of 'old curmudgeon . . . miserable git . . . dog in the manger,' and some even more abusive. How can I persuade them of the gulf which yawns between Arcadian Montana circa 1920 and overcrowded, polluted England in 1993? A friend who runs a tackle shop expressed the hope that the film might inspire in the UK, as it has in the US, an explosion of interest in fly fishing. Now, times are as hard in the tackle trade as anywhere else, and I sympathise with his hopes. But I do not share them. There are already more than enough anglers for our over-stressed waters. The last thing I want is an influx of hillbilly types asking if I can point them at an accessible Home Counties equivalent to the Big Blackfoot. If I sound a trifle irritable, it is because I found the film a trifle irritating. It is moderately enjoyable, nice to look at, half an hour too long, overloaded with metaphorical and metaphysical baggage, and takes itself too seriously. It did, however, set me thinking about my formative years. At the film's heart are the relationships between two brothers who learn to fish together, and their father, who teaches them. Although my father did not fish, two of my elder brothers did (one still does), and I learned with them. In the film, the brothers grow up together, fishing; grow apart, and do not fish; come together, and go fishing. Only when standing together in the rippling riffles of the Big Blackfoot can they forge again the bond between them. The symbolism is weighty indeed. If there was such spirituality in the relationship between myself and my brothers, it must have been very deep; I was not aware of it then, nor am I now. We went fishing together. We suffered together. We swore at each other. We laughed together. Yes, I still like to go fishing with the brother who still fishes. But I doubt if there is enough depth or current in the river of our relationship to encourage the camera to linger. Amid all the nostalgia-drenched fantasy of A River Runs Through It, there was one moment of truth which struck an answering chord in me. It comes when the elder brother, Norman, having caught one good fish, hooks another. Grinning in a superior fashion, he looks across at brother Paul, who sends back across the water a grim, desperate smile, suffused with rage and envy. I recall such a moment when my brother looked at me like that. I need say no more other than that I had just caught a salmon and he had not. There have been other times when he has returned from a distant pool with an insufferable expression on his face and a catch of trout which has made me queasy with jealousy. The moral, I fear, is that the more ignoble the emotion, the more real it is. The rest is just Hollywood.</p>

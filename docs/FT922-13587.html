			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / Election 1992: Where the last seat could count for everything A FEW SEATS could make all the difference. For however small the gap between Labour and the Tories when the final results are declared today, the party with the most MPs will probably be in government by the start of next week. Mr Major will almost certainly resign if the Conservatives are not the largest party, in which case the Queen would automatically send for Mr Kinnock to take office. Neither side need talk to Mr Paddy Ashdown before forming a government. In practice only Labour is likely even to wish to approach the Liberal Democrats - and then only if it is some way short of an overall majority and the third party's group of MPs is large enough to provide such a majority. To do that Mr Ashdown probably needs at least 25 MPs. If talks between Labour and the Liberal Democrats take place, the formation of the next government could take up to 10 days. Far more likely, however, is the possibility that Mr Kinnock would form a government and challenge the minor parties to defeat him in parliament. For any minority government the first test would be the debate on the Queen's Speech in the Commons, to be presented on May 6 and voted on a week later. Promises of a Scottish parliament and other constitutional reforms attractive to the Liberal Democrats would very likely feature in a Labour Queen's Speech. The content of a Tory speech is problematic - particularly its approach to Scotland. If the Conservatives presented a Queen's Speech as the largest party and were defeated, the Queen would automatically send for Mr Kinnock. Were Mr Kinnock in turn defeated, another election would have to follow immediately. However, there would be strong pressure to avoid two back-to-back elections and some temporary arrangement - possibly involving a Tory abstention on Labour's Queen's Speech - could be expected to keep a minority Labour government in office until the autumn. So an immediate second election is highly unlikely, but the chances of the current parliament lasting a year are slim.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- STATE OF PARTIES WHEN THE ELECTION WAS CALLED  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                            Seats  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Conservatives                367 Labour                       227 Liberal Democrats             22 Ulster Unionists               9 Scottish Nationals             5 Plaid Cymru                    3 SDLP                           3 Social Democrats               3 Democratic Unionists           3 Ulster Popular Unionist        1 Provisional Sinn Fein          1 Independent Labour             1 Socialist Labour               1 Speaker and three deputies     4  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL                        650  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / Business and the Law: Lender to bear loss resulting from negligent valuation - Legal Briefs A finance house which lent money for the acquisition of a commercial property based on an incorrect valuation cannot recover any of its capital loss from a negligent valuer, the English High Court has ruled. The court's decision in Nyckeln Finance v Stumpbrook Continuation comes shortly after the Banque Bruxelles Lambert v Eagle Star case in which it was ruled that a negligent valuer was not liable for losses resulting from a collapse in the property market. But the judge in the latter case had left open the possibility of a claim by the lender for loss of its 'cushion' - the difference between the amount of the loan and the perceived value of the property. In Nyckeln, the judge did not award damages for loss of 'cushion'. Mr Edwin Cheyney of Wilde Sapte, Nyckeln's solicitors, said the decision would take many in the property world by surprise. 'It means capital losses can now only be recovered if the lender has lent more than the actual value of the property after the drop in the market value has been taken into account,' he said. The administrator of Nyckeln, Mr Maurice Withall of accountants Grant Thornton, is considering an appeal.</p>

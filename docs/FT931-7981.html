			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Conservative Euro-sceptics vow loyalty at by-election TORY Euro-sceptic MPs yesterday pledged not to back any anti-Maastricht candidate who stood against an official Conservative in the forthcoming Newbury by-election. Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East and an opponent of the Maastricht treaty, described as 'unthinkable' the prospect of supporting anyone other than the official Tory choice. The by-election has been caused by the death on Friday of Mrs Judith Chaplin, Newbury's Conservative MP, which has reduced the government's Commons' majority to 20 while it is still struggling to get legislation on Maastricht approved. The row over the treaty will erupt again today when Liberal Democrats press for the attorney-general to make a statement on the government's legal advice concerning the treaty. Later in the day MPs will return to the bill's committee stage. Lord Tebbit, a former Tory party chairman, yesterday again urged MPs to vote against the government and block Maastricht, saying it need not end parliamentary careers. He said: 'People who have opposed governments find themselves in government. People who support governments sometimes find themselves in the dog-house.' Tory MPs know, however, that backing an opponent in a by-election would invite expulsion from the party. Sir Teddy said: 'There is no way that we could be part of an attempt to undermine a Conservative candidate.' One of the Euro-sceptics' unofficial whips at Westminster added: 'I would be totally against it.' The by-election will nevertheless be a significant test for the government, with the Liberal Democrats expected to mount a strong challenge. Mrs Chaplin had a majority of 12,357 over the Liberal Democrats in April 1992 - smaller than Tory margins overturned by Liberal Democrats in by-elections before the general election in April last year. The town is typical of many of the Liberal Democrats' most sensational by-election victories.</p>

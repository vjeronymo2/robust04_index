The year of 1992 marked the entry of the bilateral  relationship into a new phase of development, Zhu, here on a  nine-day official visit, said in a speech titled "China's Reform  and Development in 1994."    In 1992, Chinese Communist Party leader Jiang Zemin visited  Tokyo while Japanese Emperor Akihito traveled to Beijing in  celebration of the 20th anniversary of the normalization of  diplomatic ties, he explained.    "The Chinese Government and people attach great importance  to  their good neighborly relations with Japan," he said.    He said China shares much in common with Japan and the two  countries complement each other economically.    Bilateral trade totaled 39 billion U.S. dollars last year,  an increase of 54 percent over the previous year, the  vice-premier noted.</p>

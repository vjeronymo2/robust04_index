			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] La Paz Radio Fides Network in Spanish at  1100 GMT on 28 February carries, in its regularly scheduled  newscast, several reports on demonstrations, clashes, and  strikes nationwide.    In a 90-second report from Oruro, the announcer comments on  university students' plans to stage demonstrations today  protesting the central government's failure to meet fund  allocation demands; on confirmation by the departmental offices  of the Bolivian Labor Federation, COB, that local streets will  be blocked for one hour, beginning 1500 GMT, in rejection of the  government's failure to meet workers' petition; on a regional  meeting of union leaders to begin at 1830 GMT to schedule ways  of exerting pressure on the government during this week; and on  a Mining Corporation of Bolivia, Comibol, deadline today for  miners to tender their voluntary resignation and thus become  entitled to a $1,000 bonus.    In a one-minute report from Cochabamba, the announcer  comments on the declaration of a state of emergency in the  tropical Chapare region following frequent clashes between coca  growers and Mobile Rural Patrol Unit, Umopar, agents because  coca growers refuse to have their plantations eradicated even  though, in some parts of the department, they are growing more  coca than the compulsory coca eradication program allows.    In a two-minute report from Potosi, the announcer comments  on  the miners' harsh criticism of the current administration and  describes the tragic situation prevailing inside Unificada mine  where water supply, air supply, and electricity have been  suspended to force miners to voluntarily resign. The announcer  also reports on the situation reigning at other local mines and  protests about the $1,000 bonus from which, in several leaders  and workers' opinion, a large amount will deducted under the  concept of social contribution.    In a two-minute report from Santa Cruz, the announcer  comments on local university students' refusal to suspend  demonstrations -- which on 25 February ended in violent clashes  with the police and a large number of people injured -- unless  government meets their fund allocation demands, and on student  leaders' protests over police violence during said  demonstrations.</p>

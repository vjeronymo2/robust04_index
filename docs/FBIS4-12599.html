			<p>BFN     [Text] Early this morning, security forces caught four  people who infiltrated from Jordan into Israeli territory near  the Hammat Gader area. The four were unarmed, and they may be  Iraqi citizens. Our correspondent in the north Yo'av Aviv  reports that large IDF [Israel Defense Forces] forces are  searching the area and have declared it a closed military zone.  The road from Ma'agan Junction to Hammat Gader and Mevo Hama  has been closed to traffic.</p>

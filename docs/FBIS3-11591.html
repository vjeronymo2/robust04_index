			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanish on 19  March carries, on page 13, a 500-word article by Mariano Obarrio  which notes that "the Interior Ministry did not officially  comment on the attack on the Tucuman Congress building, although  high-level officials are aware of the details of the incident."  Interior Ministry Spokesman Julio Macchi explained, however,  that it was a strictly provincial problem and that this ministry  cannot interfere unless the provincial authorities ask. Macchi  said that on 17 March Interior Minister Carlos Ruckauf met with  Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega who commented that "the problem  had been overcome."    The same page of this newspaper carries a 400-word article  by  Hector Domingo Padilla datelined San Miguel de Tucuman on the  heated meeting held by Tucuman Congress during which the  Executive Branch was held responsible for the attack on 17  March. Prior to the session, which ended with a declaration  voicing confidence that the corresponding investigations will be  made and those responsible punished, "acting Provincial Congress  President Mario Cristian Saracho was visited by a group of  leaders of the regional CGT [General Confederation of Labor] who  apologized for the recent incidents and expressed respect for  the democratic regime."    On the same page is another 450-word unattributed report  which notes that "while Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega yesterday  rejected charges by the opposition that the serious incidents  caused by some 200 workers on 17 March against the provincial  Congress building were a maneuver to intervene this body, the  court ordered the arrest of Tucuman CGT Secretary General Miguel  Brito and his secretary Luis Gonzalez for their alleged  participation in the incident." Governor Ortega denied that the  incident had political connotations like those in Santiago del  Estero last December and commented that among the demonstrators  were people who had nothing to do with La Florida Sugar Mill.    Buenos Aires PAGINA/12 on 19 March, on page 5, carries a  550-word interview with Tucuman Governor Ramon Ortega by Hector  Ali in San Miguel de Tucuman during which Ortega blurted out  that "it is time legislators started to show courage and stopped  seeking political profit from the peoples' needs and anguish."  He notes that Tucuman's problem is quite different to the one  in Santiago del Estero where public servants did not get paid  for three consecutive months. He also refutes criticisms by  Radical Legislator Gumersindo Parajon who said the incident was  a maneuver to justify the intervention of Congress and added  that he is not concerned about rumors that the riots are  orchestrated in Buenos Aires in an attempt to thwart his  intention to run as vice president.</p>

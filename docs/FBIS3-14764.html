In his words, the Latvian interpretation of the letter is  that the Russian president called on the Latvian leader to meet  and iron out differences.    "Nothing can be farther from the truth. The letter is  chiefly about the position of the Russian-speaking population in  Latvia. It expressed Russia's serious concern over that," the  diplomat said.    He explained that only in the beginning of the letter did  the  Russian president confirm his willingness to have a summit  meeting to discuss a broad range of issues and sign agreements  on troop withdrawal, social guarantees for Russian military  pensioners and the functioning of the Skrunda radar station.    "The ironing out of formulations in international agreements  is not the function of presidents. It is apparent from  Yeltsin's letter that the summit is impossible unless  negotiating teams agree on key provisions of bilateral  documents," Udaltsov said.</p>

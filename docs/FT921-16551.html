			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / The Lex Column: Marking time in the markets Despite the ebullient end to the old year in the equity markets, UK investors pondering the outlook for 1992 might draw a dispiriting parallel with this time last year. Then the immediate topic was the Gulf war. Now it is the election. Then it was assumed that, hostilities apart, the economy would be in conventional recovery by the mid-year. Now there is no such assumption. It might perhaps be argued that the resolution of the election, like that of the war, would free the market of uncertainty. But the outlook for the world economy remains so fundamentally unclear that the intentions of UK voters - however anxiously debated by the market - seem almost trivial by comparison. The problems faced by the UK economy are nothing if not familiar. The risk about ERM entry always was that the harsh medicine through which the ERM achieves its ends might coincide with the downturn in the cycle. Not only has that risk materialised; there has also been continued inflationary pressure in Germany, so that the UK is saddled with a regime of German monetary stringency at just the time when laxity is badly needed. For those of an apocalyptic turn of mind, the 1990s offer the prospect of successive UK governments making a desert and calling it price stability. Until recently, the US offered grounds for greater optimism. Since there had been no structural changes to the US economy, there seemed no reason why it should not recover in the normal cyclical fashion. But perhaps the US, like other economies around the world, has suffered a structural change of sorts: the de-regulation of the banking system in the early 1980s, which led to an explosion of competitive lending. In a normal cycle, the purging of excess debt taken on in the boom times would be a sharp but finite process. The question is whether in the late 1980s the level of debt, for individuals and corporations, reached the point where the normal psychology of recovery is now being suppressed.</p>

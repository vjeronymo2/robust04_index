			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities ease in light trade after last week's gains Wall Street AFTER LAST week's strong gains, US stock markets were in subdued form yesterday with share prices tending to ease. Trading was relatively light because of the semi-official Martin Luther King Day holiday, which closed federal offices, banks and the bond markets, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 10.95 at 3,254.03. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 2.50 to 416.36, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks ran into heavy profit-taking and fell 7.47 to 619.38. New York SE turnover came to 181m shares, while declines outpaced rises by 943 to 743. The market often opens lower on the first day after the monthly expiration of stock futures and options contracts. Last Friday the Dow had been boosted to a new high by trading linked to the expirations on derivative markets, and so some downward correction yesterday had been anticipated. Moreover, in the absence of fresh economic and big corporate news, those investors not away for the one-day holiday chose to take it easy, only occasionally dipping into the market to take some profits earned during the recent sharp advance. Upjohn fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 1/2 amid a deepening row over alleged side effects of its best selling sleeping drug, Halcion. It issued strong condemnations of researchers who claim to have found that Halcion causes serious psychiatric side effects among some users. In the same sector, Pfizer rose initially on the news that researchers in Boston have reported on their preliminary human tests with an experimental drug for adult-onset diabetes, but eventually succumbed to market-wide selling and ended down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 76 1/4 . The drug is licensed to Pfizer and another company. Other drug stocks, which were heavily sold last week on rotational trading by investors switching between sectors, were mixed. Glaxo put on Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 31 5/8 but Schering-Plough declined Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 60 7/8 . UAL dropped Dollars 4 to Dollars 152 in the wake of last Friday's warning that it expected to report the largest three-month loss in its history for the fourth quarter. Raytheon, which shot to fame during the Gulf war as the maker of the Patriot anti-missile weapon, weakened Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 87 1/4 on reports that it has submitted a bid for General Dynamics' Cessna aircraft unit. Dynamics retreated Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 59 1/2 . On the over-the-counter market, Landmark Graphics tumbled Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 20 3/4 after reporting fiscal second-quarter income of 30 cents a share, up from a year earlier but still below market estimates. Canada TORONTO failed to establish a clear trend although trading was fairly heavy. The composite index eased 2.6 to close at 3,655.7, but rises narrowly outnumbered falls by 329 to 280 after a volume of 30.5m shares, down from Friday's 34.9m. The gold group had the day's biggest gain among the sub-indices, a rise of 1.5 per cent. Canadian Pacific Forest fell CDollars 1 1/4 to CDollars 26 1/4 . The company said it will issue 8.5m common shares at CDollars 26.50 apiece. It currently has about 44m shares outstanding. Bombardier 'A' rose CDollars 1 1/2 to CDollars 31 1/2 and the 'B' added CDollars  7/8 at CDollars 31 1/2 . The company's president said he is confident that negotiations will be successfully completed for Bombardier to buy a stake in Boeing's de Havilland unit.</p>

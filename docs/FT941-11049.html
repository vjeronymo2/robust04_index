			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / International Press Review Germany Reflecting on BMW's surprise takeover of Rover last week, even Bild, the raucous popular daily, appeared choked by some of the noxious anti-German gas generated in the British tabloid press. After crowing that the Brits were 'pissed off' in Tuesday's paper, by Wednesday it was mourning the persistence of old resentments and weary propaganda. 'The Germans are coming,' wrote leader writer Peter Boenisch. But, he asked, was the arrival of BMW instead of bombs and rockets something to be afraid of? No, it was marvellous. 'Democratic Germany is saying 'hello' and not 'Sieg Heil'.' The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung suggested that relatively few Britons were angry that the 'bloody Germans' had bought Rover. It appeared to take the view that underneath any resentment lay a feeling that the high reputation of German industry and products was more important. The stock market's Borsen-Zeitung took a similar view. Rover would benefit from BMW's good name. On the other hand Rover customers would become more demanding and no longer accept 'weaknesses' in their cars which they had tolerated in the past. This would require heavy investment it added. Reflecting similar concerns aired in other commercially-angled analyses, the Borsen-Zeitung said a question mark remained over Mr Pischetsrieder's calculation that two and two made five. Wirtschafts Woche, the business weekly, dwelt on recent failures in motor industry mergers, citing the Renault-Volvo case and Volkswagen's disasters with Seat in Spain. But it also made the point that Rover had more rich and famous customers for its Range-Rover models than BMW had for the whole of its 7-Series range. Ukraine The victory of a pro-Russia separatist in Crimea's presidential elections last week overshadowed the long running debate on nuclear disarmament in the Ukrainian press. Kievsky Vedomosti, Ukraine's leading newspaper, viewed the election result as a threat to Ukraine's territorial integrity, saying the Crimean president's 'mandate of popular confidence' - practically unanimous (73 per cent of the vote) - is a substantial 'trump card in launching a political game with Kiev'. The paper offered presidents of Crimea and Ukraine a prayer in resolving the standoff: 'God help them]' Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk's reaction to Crimea was notable by its absence. Ukraine's opposition daily, Nezavisimost (The Independent), joked about their president's notorious silence at critical moments: 'God reveals to Clinton, Yeltsin and Kravchuk that the world will end in 24 hours. Clinton summons journalists and tells his chosen people' to play the anthem and raise the flag. Yeltsin organises a demonstration and orders his people to drink and eat. Kravchuk. . . is silent. Finally, people run to him and scream, we've all heard it on the radio. What should we do?' He answers, 'Relax, relax. . . We'll gather the government and discuss the issue according to its scheduled order.' The opposition daily was bursting with criticism from politicians who believed Mr Kravchuk should have 'annulled the elections' in Crimea. Instead, 'a conflict is coming to a head,' it warned, adding that 'it will be difficult to spare Crimeans from the civil war' which has already spread to other regions of the former Soviet Union. All the newspapers took pains to explain that Ukraine's economic collapse was the most important factor in the separatist vote. Only two years ago, noted the government's mouthpiece Uryadovy Kuryer, the Russian-dominated Black Sea peninsula voted to be a part of an independent Ukraine. France The growing tendency of Prime Minister Edouard Balladur to buy his way out of trouble - first with the farmers, then Air France strikers and state schools supporters, and now the fishermen - has up to now caused him little trouble. The French public, which values social peace, still rates him highly in the opinion polls. The left-wing opposition has not made the connection that it is the privatisation of state companies which is bankrolling Mr Balladur's largesse. But the failure of two aid plans to defuse a fishermen's protest in Rennes on Friday that turned into a near-riot and the partial burning down of the Breton parliament, has led the conservative press to question, just a little, Mr Balladur's tactics. Yesterday's Journal de Dimanche said, 'Our governments are encouraging subversion' by handing out money to the fishermen the moment their protests turn violent, though the paper noted that the previous Socialist government had similarly caved in a year ago. Saturday's edition of Le Figaro commented on the ritual that takes place after violent demonstrations in France. 'Everyone first unites in condemning the aggressive protesters. . . and then all conclude that their demands are justified and their anger comprehensible.' The editorial deplored the fact that 'today in France one has to turn on one's 'angry lights' to get a hearing from the politicians'. However, the Bordeaux-based Ouest France solidly endorsed the fishermen's claims, saying on the morning of the Rennes riot that 'courage and sang-froid' could be expected of them. Courage, yes. Sang froid, hardly.</p>

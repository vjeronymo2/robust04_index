Questar estimates the total cost of the proposal to be $1.5 million. Questar states that the Fidlar Station modifications will increase its available main-line capacity by approximately 22 Mmcf per day. Questar indicates that it has entered into two firm transportation service agreements with Barrett Fuels Corporation (Barrett) and VESGAS Company (VESGAS) for a total of 19 Mmcf per day (20,000 Dth) of which 14 Mmcf per day will become available through a main-line replacement project pending in Docket No. CP94&hyph;765&hyph;000.

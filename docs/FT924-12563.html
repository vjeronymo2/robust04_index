			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Arts: Katharina Wolpe's dedicated interpretation The career of composer Stefan Wolpe, which embraced many places - Berlin, where he was born in 1902, the Weimar Bauhaus, Jerusalem, New York, where he died in 1972 of indecently lingering Parkinson's Disease  - and numerous musical styles: tonality, jazz, Busoni-esque neo-classicism, the twelve-tonery of Schoenberg and Webern) - remains relatively little known and his work under-appreciated. Yet he belongs in the pantheon of 20th century masters. The piano recital by Katharina Wolpe given as part of the MusICA series at the ICA on Sunday was most welcome and persuasive advocacy, and it drew nearly a full house. There was special pleasure in hearing the dedicated interpretations of the composer's daughter, as in descrying the family likeness; but Ms. Wolpe's performances stood by their own signal merit: her bright limpidity of touch, keenly intelligent formal sense, and instinctively classicist and restrained manner. The programme ranged widely over Wolpe's oeuvre, unfolding in nearly chronological order, beginning with the knowingly-entitled Early Piece from 1924. This was an interesting piece: eclectic in harmony, touching on fugue, and very distinctive in the way that it manages to combine dauntless linear flow with extreme disjunctiveness of form. Wolpe's superbly intellectual Passacaglia of 1936 followed in a reading that was highly disciplined and articulate, full of feeling, and very slightly marred by fingerslips. The 7 Little Studies (1944-41), none lasting more than a few seconds, take epigrammatic subtlety as far as it can go, pre-empting the approach of the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Kurtag. (The miniatures of Schoenberg's Op. 19, on which Ms. Wolpe drew for encores, chimed nicely with the studies, as with Wolpe's piano music in general.) The far more extended 2 Studies of 1948 showed Wolpe at his best, creating a thrillingly wide sense of musical space but by means of intimate and plastic expressivity. Ms. Wolpe brought them off marvellously. The seven short movements (including a pair of fugues) of the Zemach Suite, written in 1939 and danced in New York by a choreographer of that name, showed a Wolpe of jazzy tonal asperity; while the two Forms, No. 1 from 1959 and No. 4 (subtitled Broken Sequences) from 1969 (the second and third, intended for chamber ensembles, fell victim to his disease), showed the composer at his most masterfully abstract - abstract and yet subtle and radiant and many-mooded and fascinating. The concert was a triumph.</p>

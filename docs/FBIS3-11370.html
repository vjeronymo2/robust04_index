			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "The IMF Backs Fernando Henrique Cardoso"] </F>   [Text] The official note issued on 16 March by IMF  Managing General Michel Camdessus undoubtedly is a sign of great  support for the Brazilian Government's economic program and, in  turn, Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso.    The language of Camdessus' message is even surprising taking  into account that the IMF was upset -- and rightly so -- because  several Brazilian administrations failed to honor the terms of  the agreements signed with this international organization. It  was, therefore, only natural that the IMF receive with  skepticism any promises coming from Brasilia to stabilize the  country's economy.    Quite the opposite happened. The IMF, through its managing  director, accepted promises that are easiest to measure, such as  the promise that the operational deficit (including the interest  on domestic and foreign debts) will be zero in 1994 and that  there will be a primary surplus (without interest) of around 4  percent of the GDP. The IMF also accepted the economic team's  argument that the implementation of the URV [Real Value Unit]  will do away with the "backward-looking" [preceding two words in  English] indexation, that is, that takes past inflation into  account.    Consequently, the IMF promises to work closely with  Brazilian  authorities to help the economic program launched on 28 February  be successful "soon." But Camdessus has promised to extend this  cooperation to the immediate future by promising a stand-by  agreement or another way of close cooperation, for a start, when  the new currency, the real, is put into circulation.    The IMF's green light paves the road for Brazil to reach an  agreement with the private creditor banks that, in turn, will  again make Brazil more attractive to investors. The terms of  Camdessus' message are so categorical and even unusual that they  sound almost as an invitation to invest in Brazil, which, as is  obvious, will only contribute to the program's success.    Although, in its capacity as a technical organization, the  IMF will not interfere in domestic political affairs, it is hard  to ignore the political message contained in the note. The note  undoubtedly represents a strong backing by the international  financial community for the finance minister either for what is  left of his mandate or, namely, a presidential candidacy.</p>

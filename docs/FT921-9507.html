			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Four die in Yugoslav ceasefire violation THREE Serb irregulars and one Croat guardsman were killed yesterday in the most serious single violation of the five-week-old ceasefire in Yugoslavia, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade. Belgrade radio said the three Serbs were killed and two were wounded around Vukovar and Vinkovci, eastern Croatia, when Croat forces fired on Serb-controlled positions. According to Croatian radio, the Croat soldier died and two were injured in an artillery attack launched by Serb fighters in the same region of eastern Croatia. Croat leaders have vowed to reclaim the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia, Baranja and Western Srem currently controlled by the Serb-dominated federal army. A western diplomat yesterday said: 'It is not yet clear if the most recent violations are just isolated incidents in eastern Croatia where the truce is most fragile. The danger of renewed clashes increases the longer it takes to deploy the (United Nations) peacekeepers. This delay, coupled with the apparent Croatian build-up and its more aggressive stance, could seriously jeopardise the ceasefire.' Meanwhile, Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said an extra 25 unarmed UN liaison officers had arrived yesterday, bringing to 76 the number bolstering communications in crisis zones. UN officials last week said the ceasefire was stable enough to despatch a force of 10,000 peacekeepers. But consistent opposition from Mr Milan Babic, president of Krajina, a Serb enclave in Croatia, has delayed the deployment of UN forces. Mr Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president, has also raised objections over police control of Krajina and other Serb-held territories in Croatia.</p>

			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Taiwan agrees to restrain sales of machine tools in US TAIWAN, under considerable US pressure, has agreed to two more years of limits on its machine tool exports to the US, with the Bush administration promising the 'voluntary' restraints will be phased out by 1993. Japan bowed to similar US pressure for a two-year extension of the five-year quotas in April. In 1986, both countries agreed to limit their exports to their 1981 market share in several categories of machine tools. The Association for Manufacturing Technology, which won the administration's support for an extension on grounds of national security, said the new pact would give additional breathing space to the industry and its workers. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, said the understanding would allow US companies 'to complete necessary programmes for advancing US national security interests while providing a gradual return to market-determined competition'. The new agreement with Taiwan will allow machining centres, lathes and milling machine imports to be raised over their current levels by 29 units in 1992 and 281 units next year. The US industry claims large gains during its period of protection. Its exports rose from Dollars 600m in 1986 to Dollars 1.1bn in 1990 and 1991. Companies affected have increased their annual investment by 78 per cent.</p>

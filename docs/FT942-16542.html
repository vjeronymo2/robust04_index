			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / International Company News: More SAS jobs to go in SKr3bn cuts plan Two key planks in a SKr3bn cost-cutting programme were put into place by Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) yesterday when it announced agreements on big cuts in pilot numbers and cabin staff. The airline said up to 300 pilots would lose their jobs, saving about SKr310m in wages and administration costs. It hoped numbers would fall through voluntary early retirement, unpaid leave, and part-time work, so that staff would not have to be dismissed. It expects to reach its target within three years. The airline said about 680 cabin jobs would also disappear to achieve SKr410m in savings. The programme involves reduced crewing levels, fewer days off, and a wage freeze until next March. Both measures have been agreed with staff, although final details have still to be worked out. In total, SAS is cutting 2,900 jobs, one in seven of its workforce, to slash costs by SKr3bn by the middle of next year. It aims to return to profit this year, after four consecutive years in the red. Last year the airline made a SKr492m (Dollars 62.3m) pre-tax loss.</p>

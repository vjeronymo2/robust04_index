			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / People: UB chief for Thames Sir Robert Clarke, chairman of United Biscuits, will take over as part-time chairman of Thames Water, Britain's largest quoted water company, from March of next year. The appointment follows the sudden death of Sir Roy Watts at the end of April. David Luffrum, group finance director, says the board was 'of the unanimous view that if we could find a strong candidate from among the existing directors, that would be the ideal solution'. Sir Robert has been a non-executive director since 1988 and the run-up to flotation. Although he will be 65 when he takes up the chairmanship, Luffrum says he is in 'remarkably good health. There is every expectation he will be chairman for a good few years.' However, Clarke is unable to start until he reduces his role to that of non-executive chairman at United Biscuits, a company of similar size to Thames, next year. In the meantime Sir Christopher Leaver, currently deputy chairman, takes on the role. Leaver is a former Lord Mayor of London (1981-1982) and was chairman of the London Tourist Board between 1983 and 1989. Whereas Sir Roy spent 'four to four and a half days a week' at Thames, according to Luffrum, Clarke is expected to devote 'not more than two days' to the assignment. Luffrum explains that chief executive Mike Hoffman had been in control of day-to-day management issues and he had been also increasingly involved in matters of strategy. Hoffman takes on the additional title of deputy chairman until next March; thereafter there are likely to be two deputy chairmen when Clarke takes over from Leaver. The succession question was already well advanced before Sir Roy's death; Watts had been planning to announce his retirement at the AGM in July.</p>

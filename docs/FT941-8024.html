			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Sports Council complaints backed A top Whitehall official acknowledged yesterday that there had been justifiable complaints about recent financial management and practices at the Sports Council, the government body charged with promoting sporting activity in the UK. Mr Hayden Phillips, permanent secretary at the Department of National Heritage, told MPs that the Sports Council had not established a proper 'arms-length relationship' with a subsidiary trust company that it had set up in 1990. He also accepted a claim from the National Audit Office, the government's accountancy watchdog, that 'potential conflicts of interest' had been created by the award of a tender to a company whose chairman and principal shareholder was the Sports Council's finance director. Mr Phillips, whose department administers the Sports Council's affairs, was giving evidence to the Public Accounts Committee, the committee of backbench MPs which examines how public money is spent. Yesterday's enquiry was given no evidence of financial impropriety. However, the complexity of the council's arrangements was frequently criticised by PAC members. Mr Alan Williams, Labour MP for Swansea, said 'it would be hard to think of a way of organising financial arrangements more likely to arise suspicion.' Mr Phillips said that there was some merit to claims that there had not been full transparency of cashflows between the council and a trust company which it had set up in 1990. 'The potential conflicts of interest in the relationship between the trust company and the council did cause real concern,' he told MPs. The main decisions had preceded the setting up of the department in 1992. 'I quite accept that the sort of arrangement whereby the same person appears in different capacities is one which should be avoided,' he said.</p>

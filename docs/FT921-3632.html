			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / International Company News: Profits at ABN Amro surge 15.9% to Fl 1.5bn ABN AMRO, the Netherlands' biggest bank, posted a 15.9 per cent rise in net profit in 1991, reflecting buoyant profits in its domestic operations and improved interest margins. Net profit increased to Fl 1.54bn (Dollars 830m) last year from Fl 1.33bn in 1990. Gross profits showed an even stronger rise, of 18.6 per cent to Fl 3.66bn, thanks largely to a 34 per cent increase in the Netherlands, which generated slightly more than 70 per cent of the bank's results last year. The bank, which declined to make a profit forecast for 1992, said it would pay an unchanged 1991 dividend of Fl 2.90. A 16 per cent increase in interest income helped lift ABN Amro's total revenue by 13.1 per cent, to Fl 11.32bn, outstripping a 10.6 per cent increase in total costs to Fl 7.67bn. In the Netherlands, costs rose by just 2.9 per cent, while revenues rose by 12.1 per cent. Commenting on the limited rise in costs, which was due mainly to a 2 per cent decline in the bank's Dutch workforce, Mr Roelof Nelissen, chairman, said: 'It is too early to see this as the benefits of the merger.' ABN Amro, which was formed through a merger in 1990, did not merge its domestic operations into one bank until September 1991. Abroad, gross results fell by 7.5 per cent to Fl 1.1bn. Results rose in North America, the Middle East, eastern Asia, and Africa, but fell sharply in Central and South America. In Europe, ABN Amro saw 'satisfactory' profits except in France, where results were held back by the restructuring of its stockbroking subsidiaries and the lack of book profits on property sales which boosted 1990 results. Overall, gross results in Europe declined to Fl 416m from Fl 505m in 1990. Freight-forwarder Koninklijke Frans Maas has agreed to co-operate with Yellow Freight System of the US. They will combine European and North American networks.</p>

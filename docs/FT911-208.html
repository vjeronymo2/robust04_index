			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): Few union deals at new plants UNIONS appear to have found it increasingly difficult in the past three years to gain recognition agreements from inward investors and British companies setting up new plants, a senior TUC official said yesterday. Mr John Monks, TUC deputy general secretary, said only 10 deals had been notified to the TUC since October 1988 under a procedure to regulate inter-union conflict of the kind which led to the expulsion of the EETPU electricians' union. Under the prior-notification procedure, which was made permanent in June last year after an extended trial period, unions should tell the TUC about any single-union deal they are about to sign. Mr Monks told a conference in London that the number of deals was 'very small' compared with the rush of agreements signed in the mid-1980s. This led to conflict when unions competed in 'beauty contests' for recognition. He said that was one reason why TUC unions supported the idea of a statutory recognition procedure under a Labour government. That would allow a 'step-by-step' approach to rights depending on union membership. Mr Monks said the TUC might switch support to establishing the size of union membership in a company by a workforce ballot rather than by a petition drawn up by a union. He said that it might be 'politically advisable' to assess membership size through a ballot in order to gain public support for the TUC's proposals. Mr Monks said the prior-notification procedure had worked well. The final proposals are to be approved by the TUC general council in June.</p>

			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON BEACH;  </P> <P> FLASHING ELECTRONIC BILLBOARDS APPROVED  </P> <P> Huntington Beach will allow flashing electronic billboards under a compromise  adopted by the City Council.  </P> <P> The City Council decided earlier this week to allow 25-foot-tall electronic  reader boards to display ads for large businesses along Beach Boulevard and the  San Diego Freeway.  </P> <P> Roger Miller Honda on Beach Boulevard had asked the city to change its code to  allow 35-foot-high electronic signs, but the Planning Commission rejected the  request in August.  </P> <P> On appeal, the City Council overturned the commission's decision and voted to  allow smaller electronic signs with certain restrictions.  </P> <P> The signs can be up to 115 square feet, with just 90 square feet for the  electronic part of the sign. The council also added a provision that the sign  must be used 10% of the time to display community-oriented messages.  </P> <P> Businesses that want signs must get a permit from the Planning Commission,  which must determine that a sign would not adversely affect people living in  nearby residential areas, the council decided.  </P> <P> Having a sign will help attract customers to the dealership, said Al  Parajeckas, vice president of Roger Miller Automotive Group. The dealership  could have a sign up in four to six months if the city approval process goes  smoothly, he said.  </P></p>

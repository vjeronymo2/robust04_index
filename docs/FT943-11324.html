			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Finance and the Family: Water shares offer stable income on tap - What the new price regime means for investors Water investors should be feeling rather pleased following the announcement this week of a new price regime for the UK's 31 water and sewerage companies. While the industry regulator has set tougher price limits for the companies, he has managed to leave enough leeway on average to give better returns to shareholders than those expected just a week ago. Ian Byatt, director-general of the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), has set the price increases for the next 10 years at an average 1 percentage point above inflation - a formula known as the K factor. This compares with an average 5 per cent a year since privatisation in 1989. The increase has been heavily weighted towards the first five years, with an average K of 1.4 for 1995-2000 falling to 0.4 to 2005. This is when companies will need the highest price rises to fund the vast capital spending programme necessary to bring the industry up to EU standards. Byatt's tougher approach on the second five years is certain to be the subject of another review in 1999, rendering those figures almost irrelevant. While the price limits for 1995 to 2000 fall roughly in the middle of analysts' expectations, Byatt's trick was to reduce substantially the capital spending burden faced by water companies. Instead of the Pounds 16bn which they had realistically expected - although this was not what they told the regulator in their submissions - Byatt's negotiations with the government brought the figure down to Pounds 14bn. The reduction is due both to deferring some spending and squeezing budgets for elements such as population growth. Ofwat's pronouncements were greeted as tough but fair by nine of the 10 water and sewerage companies. The one exception is South West Water, which has enjoyed a K factor of 11.5 for the last three years due to the vast amount of spending it faces to clean up its extensive coastline. To almost universal surprise, South West was given a K of just 1.5 for 1995 and 1 for 1996-2000 on the back of virtually halved capital expenditure. The group, which argues Byatt has not allowed enough capital spending to fund future obligations, is challenging his decision at the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Nevertheless, the other water companies were relieved. Indeed, companies such as Thames Water - widely regarded to have been given more stringent targets - were confident of achieving what they called 'satisfactory returns to shareholders'. Analysts define 'satisfactory' as dividend growth approaching an annual rate of 4 per cent above inflation for the sector as a whole, against expectations before the review of 3 per cent. The price review's findings make the sector look much more attractive in terms of returning a stable income. Some analysts question, however, whether investors should get over-excited about the sector's prospects. 'You have to ask whether it will out-perform the market over the next few months,' says Mr Bill Dale, an analyst with S G Warburg Securities. While the equity market will be driven by recovery, the risks such as increasing environmental legislation continue to affect water shares. The case for water investment becomes stronger when looking at individual companies. Following the review, they can be placed in four categories: The Winners - Anglian and Southern. Both have been given high K factors relative to their capital spend. Anglian's K factor was in line with estimates, but the capital spend has been sharply cut from a forecast Pounds 1.95bn to Pounds 1.4bn. Southern also comes up trumps with a K factor at the top end of the range and authorised commitments at Pounds 1.2bn - bang in the middle of expectations. Second Place - North West, Severn Trent, Northumbrian, Welsh. North West, identified as one of the most efficient companies on water and waste, is already boasting about having beaten Byatt's efficiency target of 1 per cent cost savings a year. Severn Trent, which is not heavily exposed to the expensive coastal clean-up legislation, got a decent K of 0.5, on squeezed capital expenditure of Pounds 1.9bn. Northumbrian is confident it can live with the tough targets it has been set, even though rated by Byatt as one of the least efficient on water and sewerage services. Although Welsh was given a positive K of 0.5 against expectations of a negative number, it still has tough efficiency targets. Nevertheless it has a strong balance sheet. Rest of the pack - Wessex, Thames and Yorkshire. Wessex received a K roughly in line with expectations at 1.5 and was slightly squeezed on spending with capital expenditure of Pounds 500m. Yet increasingly the future of this company will depend on its waste management business. Thames and Yorkshire appear to have been given challenging targets. Left behind - South West Water. It is pointless to consider the K of 0.5 given to South West until the MMC has a chance to examine Byatt's reasoning.</p>

			<p>930929 FT  29 SEP 93 / Insurers win global premium income boost WORLDWIDE premium income for UK insurance companies rose 12 per cent to Pounds 83.6bn last year, the Association of British Insurers reported yesterday. Long-term business rose to Pounds 52.5bn last year compared with Pounds 47.5bn in 1991. General business was Pounds 31.3bn against Pounds 27.3bn in the previous year. The figures are based on a survey of the 450 association members and a number of large non-members, and are estimated to cover 99 per cent of long-term business and 93 per cent of general insurance business. There were 6.4m new life policies taken out last year, bringing the total to 86m individual policies in force at the end of the year. Annual premiums on new long-term UK individual business fell slightly to Pounds 3.1bn while single premiums rose to Pounds 14.2bn. Worldwide general business underwriting resulted in losses of Pounds 4.9bn against a loss of Pounds 7bn in 1991, reducing the proportion of losses to premiums from 25.5 per cent to 15.7 per cent. Insurance companies paid out more than Pounds 2.1bn on theft and arson claims last year. The association estimated the costs of the IRA bombs in April 1992 at St Mary Axe and Staples Corner in London at Pounds 350m, and the 1993 Bishopsgate bombing at Pounds 500m. Annual average payments by British households on all forms of insurance rose 11 per cent to Pounds 979 between 1990 and 1991, according to the latest figures supplied to the association by the Central Statistical Office. Average yearly household expenditure on motor insurance was Pounds 260 in 1991. Nearly two thirds of households paid motor premiums. Only 9 per cent of households had private medical insurance, which covered only individuals not covered in private schemes through their companies. Insurance Statistics 1988-92.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Li Peng Is To Cut the Ribbon at the Inauguration </F> of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station This Weekend"]    [Text] Chinese Premier Li Peng is arriving in Shenzhen  this weekend to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony of  Guangdong's Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station. According to  informed sources, this ceremony will be brief and short in  accordance with the principle of "high standard, small scope"  without giving it too much publicity.    Sources in Beijing said: His health permitting, Li Peng will  definitely attend the inaugural ceremony of the Daya Bay Nuclear  Power Station. Many personalities from the French consortium  will also attend the ceremony. Because the No. 1 unit of the  power station has already gone into operation and generated over  700 million kwt-hours, this will be just a ceremony, so it will  be as simple as possible.    The staff of Guangdong Provincial Nuclear Power Joint  Venture  Corporation have been stepping up preparations for the ceremony.  They held a meeting yesterday to discuss arrangements for the  procedure. One official said: The period from 4 to 6 February  will be the busiest for receiving visitors from the State  Council, the provincial authorities, the city authorities, and  abroad. He said: If all goes well, Li Peng will definitely turn  up. He said that Li Peng has always paid close attention to the  construction of Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station and promised to  visit it when it went into operation.    Sources said: After the No. 1 generating unit went into  operation, the No. 2 unit is also entering the phase of trial  generation in June this year.    It has been nearly 10 years since preparations for building  Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station started. The total investment is  $4 billion, making it the biggest joint-venture project in China  up to now. Guangdong Province and Hong Kong's China Light and  Power Company co-invested in the project a total of $400  million, in a three to one ratio. The two 900,000-kwt  generating units are capable of generating more than 10 billion  kwt-hours per year, of which 70 percent is to be sold to Hong  Kong. When the debts are repaid in 15 years' time, the  Chinese-Hong Kong partnership will continue for another five  years.</p>

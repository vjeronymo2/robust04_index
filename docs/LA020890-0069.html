			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COLLECTIBLES: GRANNY'S TOASTER MAY BE HOT ITEM  </P> <P> Question: I inherited my grandmother's General Electric toaster, which I think  goes back about 80 years. It's kind of weird looking, with exposed heating  coils and wires. Does it have much value? -- P.B.  </P> <P> Answer: If it's a GE toaster with a removable warming rack, it could be worth  in excess of $100 to a collector.  </P> <P> For that price, however, most collectors want the appliance to work and to be  in top condition. Your particular toaster model was patented by GE in 1908.  </P> <P> Other toasters marketed by GE and its competitors in subsequent years may be  worth upward of $50, again depending on condition, according to dealers and  collectors.  </P> <P> But don't let these prices scare you away. This is still a great area for the  collector searching for a nostalgic piece of American history at  bargain-basement prices. Collectible appliances frequently turn up at garage  sales and flea markets. After you've removed the dirt, you may often discover  that, for just a few dollars, you've acquired a valuable collectible.  </P> <P> Interestingly, electric appliances were not immediate hits with the American  consumer. Although such appliances were widely publicized as a result of their  display at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair, they didn't appear to catch on with  the public until a few years after the turn of the century.  </P> <P> Finally, years after the Chicago fair, all-electric kitchens began to  proliferate in urban areas. But the nation's rural regions kept to the old ways  and didn't seek electric appliances in any great quantity until after World War  I.  </P> <P> Most of the early electric appliances -- hot plates, irons, coffee makers and  the like -- were simply constructed, which meant that they were relatively easy  to keep in good repair.  </P> <P> That's why collectors usually insist that to be considered valuable  collectibles, electric appliances should be in working condition.  </P> <P> An exception to this rule occurs when collectors need spare parts and,  therefore, purchase non-working appliances for repair purposes. As far as  replacing worn-out electric cords, most old appliances used a standard-sized  cord that can still be bought in hardware stores.  </P> <P> Much in demand by collectors of electric appliances are the original boxes in  which they were packaged and, if they survived, instructions and manufacturer's  guarantee.  </P> <P> Congratulations to Ada Fitzsimmons on the 10th anniversary of her always  informative and interesting Paper Pile Quarterly (Box 337, San Anselmo, Calif.  94950; $10 a year).  </P> <P> In her winter (January) issue, Fitzsimmons printed her 1990 list of paper  collectible items that appear to have appreciation potential:  </P> <P> * Older magazine and newspaper articles on the subject of abortion.  </P> <P> * Women's sporting events (1920s and later).  </P> <P> * Advertising posters for magazines (starting with the year 1900).  </P> <P> * Rapid transit pass stubs (dated between the 1920s and 1960s).  </P> <P> * Wedding and bridal memorabilia.  </P> <P> * Women's image as portrayed in magazine advertising (between 1870 and 1960).  </P></p>

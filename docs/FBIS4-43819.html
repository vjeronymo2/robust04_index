			<p>BFN     [Text] Paris, June 21 (AFP) -- The Rwandan Patriotic Front  (RPF), strongly opposed to planned French military intervention  in Rwanda, on Tuesday [21 June] denied a report that a senior  RPF official would hold talks with the French government.    Jacques Bihozagara, RPF representative in Brussels, is "not  coming to Paris," his staff in the Belgian capital told AFP,  reached by telephone.    French Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin had earlier said  on French radio that Bihozagara was expected in Paris on Tuesday  for talks with the Minister Delegate for Humanitarian Action  Lucette Michaux-Chevry.    France has launched major diplomatic efforts to try to  persuade the mainly Tutsi rebel front that its plan to send up  to 2,000 soldiers to Rwanda and lead a mission to protect  civilians there is purely "humanitarian."    But the RPF accuses Paris of arming its opponents in the  mainly Hutu government army, who in turn trained Hutu extremist  militias accused of the massacre of up to half a million Tutsis  and moderate Hutus.    Asked about reports of the RPF official's visit, French  Foreign Ministry Spokesman Richard Duque said the French  government was "available" to see him.    Bihozagara was named deputy prime minister in a  power-sharing  arrangement cut between the rebels and Rwandan authorities last  August after three years of civil war.    But the government never took shape and the central African  nation plunged back into bloodletting in April.</p>

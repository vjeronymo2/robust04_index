			<p>CSO     [Text] On 26 May, the Telecommunications Council (Ministry  of Posts and Telecommunciations advisory organ) compiled a  report on the collection of "public statements" to be used in  connection with public hearings on the merits of raising  telephone rates. Although the statements are still in the  process of being collected, as of the most recent tally, 90  percent of the individuals submitting public statements are in  favor of the rate hikes. At a press conference on the same day,  Shigemichi Sonoyama, chairman of the Telecommunications  Operations Committee of the Telecommunications Council that is  sponsoring the study and chairman of the Mobile Wireless Center  expressed skepticism, saying, "There is the risk that those  opposed to a rate hike have misconstrued the government's  announcement of a rate hike freeze for the year as meaning that  there is no fear of a hike even after next year."    The public hearings will be held in the middle of June in  Tokyo, Osaka, Kumamoto, and Sendai and will involve the  discussion of items such as the 18-percent average basic fee  increase requested by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT).  Public statements will be accepted until 30 May, but, as of 26  May, 203 statements had been received and 182 of them expressed  approval of the rate hikes or stated that they were unavoidable.    When public hearings were held on public telephone rate  hikes  in October 1993, 98 individuals approved of the hikes and 73  opposed.</p>

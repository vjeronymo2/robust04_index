			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh, June 1 (AFP) -- Three foreigners  kidnapped seven weeks ago in southern Cambodia are still alive  and have been contacted daily by the Cambodian Government, an  official said Wednesday.    Information ministry spokesman Sieng Lapresse told reporters  that the missing trio were being contacted on a daily basis  through unspecified "sources," and that specialists were now  working for their release.    He said the government had ruled out a military solution to  the problem, but did not elaborate on the steps it was taking to  secure their release.    Briton Dominic Chappel, his Australian girlfriend Kelly  Wilkinson and a British friend, Tina Dominy, were travelling  from the capital to the southern port town of Sihanoukville  April 11 when their taxi was stopped by Khmer Rouge guerrillas  and the three were ordered out into the bush.    Meanwhile, the Royal Palace here released a telegram  addressed to British Prime Minister John Major Wednesday in  which King Norodom Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge had denied  kidnapping the three foreigners.    In the telegram, the king said Khmer Rouge nominal leader  Khieu Samphan had told him during Cambodian peace talks in  Pyongyang on Friday that the radical faction had not been  responsible for the abductions.    He added that he had appealed on radio and television to  those responsible for the abductions to let their prisoners go  free.</p>

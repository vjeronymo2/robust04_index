			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Spending figure misses its target THE GOVERNMENT'S public-spending figure to be announced in next week's Autumn Statement will not, after all, be Pounds 244.5bn - but that is not because of another U-turn. The cabinet had agreed to keep to the planning total for 1993-94 which was, in July, stated as Pounds 244.5bn, but technical changes have meant the figure has been revised, probably downwards. The Treasury insists that the revision is merely due to changes in the way in which particular items are classified. Such modifications happen every year, but they are not usually highlighted because the planning total is almost always exceeded. In the past few years these technical revisions have raised the planning total by about Pounds 5bn. This year the revision is an embarrassment to the government as ministers have allowed the Pounds 244.5bn to become a symbol of the cabinet's determination. The Treasury had recognised that there was a political risk in allowing the figure to become so well established, but officials advised that the change would be too complicated to explain. Any variation from the set figure while the discus-sions on spending were continuing might also have suggested either a lessening of resolve if it had been higher, or unnecessary cuts if it had been lower.</p>

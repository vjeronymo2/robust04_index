			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Bombardier makes progress BOMBARDIER, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group, reported higher profits for the year to the end of January, and is lifting its latest quarterly dividend by 25 per cent. Earnings were CDollars 107.7m (USDollars 91.27m), or 73 cents a share, against Dollars 100m, or 71 cents, the previous year. Sales for the year were Dollars 3bn, against Dollars 2.8bn. Fourth-quarter profit was CDollars 36.8m, or 24 cents a share, up from CDollars 33.3m, or 24 cents a share on fewer shares outstanding. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 965m against Dollars 801m in the year-earlier period. Full-year results of the Lear Jet operations were included in the current reporting period, against the unit's results for 10 months in the previous period. In the fourth quarter, sales of consumer products were higher. However, Bombardier said results from the transit equipment operations in Europe were disappointing. Though sales were up sharply, Eurorail of Belgium posted a loss. Bombardier has put in new management to enable it to handle profitably a much higher level of production. The new quarterly dividend rate is 5 cents a share, after a recent two-for-one stock split.</p>

			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Market Report TIN prices fell to the lowest levels since the early 1970s at the London Metal Exchange as flat demand and fears of increased producer selling weighed down sentiment. The three months price dipped to Dollars 5,150 at one stage but rallied slightly to end at Dollars 5,170 a tonne. COPPER was also under pressure in the morning but an afternoon recovery took the three months position, which had bottomed at Dollars 1,785 a tonne, to Dollars 1,800 a tonne at the close. Traders said there did not appear to be any fresh news in copper but a firmer New York market market prompted short-covering. Another metal to recoup some early losses was ZINC. The three months price ended at Dollars 942.50 a tonne after touching a six-year low of Dollars 937, but it was still Dollars 25.50 down on the day. News that German statistician FO Licht had increased its 1992-93 world deficit estimate from 2.05m tonnes to 3.17m tonnes did little for the SUGAR market as it reflected last week's announcement of a lower-than-expected Cuban crop. In late New York trading the July futures price was quoted at 10.7 cents a lb, down 0.06 from the pre-holiday level. Compiled from Reuters</p>

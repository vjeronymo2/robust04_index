			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: HIGH LIFE A WEEKLY FORUM FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS;  </P> <P> MADD IS OFFERING A PROMISING GIFT FOR MOTHER'S DAY  </P> <P> Orange County Mothers Against Drunk Driving has come up with an unusual gift  for teen-agers to give their mothers on Mother's Day: a greeting card that  carries a pledge by the son or daughter not to drink and drive or to ride with  a driver who has been drinking.  </P> <P> The cards will be available today through Sunday in stationery departments or  at Orange County MADD booths in 43 Broadway department stores in Los Angeles,  Orange and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> Thanks to a donation from the Broadway stores of Southern California, the cards  are available for a $1 donation to MADD to be used for programs for teen-agers.  </P> <P> Celebrations will be held today from 2 to 8 p.m. and Saturday from noon to 6  p.m. at the Broadway stores in Huntington Beach and Brea.  </P> <P> An organization begun by 11 high school students last year to produce anti-drug  films won $50,000 and the top honor recently at the annual Disneyland Community  Service awards luncheon.  </P> <P> The Orange County Student Advisory Council Against Drug Abuse was among 63  groups to receive a total of $250,000 from Disneyland at the 32nd annual awards  presentation at the Disneyland Hotel.  </P> <P> The council, started in February, 1988, has grown to more than 100 students  from 60 high schools. They have produced three 90-second public videos that are  showing in local theaters. The students do all the writing and acting; the goal  is to help students deal with peer pressure.  </P> <P> Nimisha Gohal, 18, one of the original council members, said that the honor  came as a complete surprise and that she started shaking as it was announced.  </P> <P> "It's amazing what we have done," Gohal said. "We wanted to form a council to  let students know that it's OK to say no to drugs."  </P> <P> Gohal, a senior at Orange High School, said the council will use the $50,000 to  make another video.  </P> <P> A total of 452 nonprofit organizations had applied for the awards. Winners were  selected by a six-member committee of community leaders and all of the money  awards were donated by Disneyland.  </P> <P>  -- MICHAEL CICCHESE,  </P> <P> Times Staff Writer  </P> <P> </P> <P> "Never mistake motion for action."  </P> <P>  -- Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961)  </P></p>

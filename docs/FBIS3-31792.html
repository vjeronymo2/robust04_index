President of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency Alija  Izetbegovic today held a telephone conversation with Turkish  President Suleyman Demirel. The Turkish president conveyed to  President Izetbegovic his country's readiness to send Turkish  troops as a part of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] to help  carry out the peace mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. In reply to  a question about the possible application of the Sarajevo model  to other cities, Izetbegovic said that this model was acceptable  with certain alterations which envisage the consistent  implementation of Resolutions 824 and 836, which oblige the  aggressor's side to place heavy weaponry under UNPROFOR control.</p>

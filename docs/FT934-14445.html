			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / World Stock Markets: Germany defies gravity in reaching for the sky - David Waller examines the reasons why equity prices have forged ahead of corporate performance After several months of vertiginous ascent, the DAX index of 30 leading shares closed yesterday comfortably above the 2,000 level, at a new closing high of 2,015. The natural question for investors who have been caught off guard by the German market's rise this year is - where next? Can the factors which sustained a sharp rally since the beginning of the year serve to take prices to further new all-time highs? If the market has defied gravity this year, it has also defied logic. Time and time again shares have maintained their momentum despite the sort of bad news and disappointments which would in other circumstances have propelled prices sharply downwards. Public finances are in a parlous state and the German economy is in its worst recession since the second world war. GDP for the west of the country is set to shrink by 2 per cent this year. Corporate earnings are imploding. Brokers have had to scale back their 1993 earnings forecasts by at least 20 per cent over the last six months as big companies such as Mannesmann delivered dire interim figures. In addition, the 'dribbling' pace of the Bundesbank's interest rate cuts would normally have proved disappointing for the investment community. In the early part of the year brokers calculated that rate cuts would be bigger than they were and would come more quickly than they did: but this too has been ignored amid the all-pervasive euphoria. The arguments used to explain the market's logic-defying performance are as follows. Interest rates will continue to fall: no matter how slowly this will be positive for the German economy on a medium-term view. Combined with this, companies are reacting to the recession by cutting costs to make themselves more competitive than ever before. An obvious example of industrial restructuring is Daimler-Benz's reduction of its workforce by 60,000 in 1992-94 as part of a wholesale reorientation of its manufacturing strategy. This pattern is being repeated across whole swathes of German industry. 'This is the sharpest cost-cutting period in the post-war era,' Deutsche Bank's Dusseldorf-based Institutional Investors Team commented in a recent market note. 'This adds to unemployment ..but corporate Germany gets healthier and more profitable if demand picks up even slightly'. In financial terms, this means a revival in corporate earnings next year, even if the recovery in the German economy proves to be slow and sales stagnate. Mr Tom Holmes, head of the research arm of Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst in Frankfurt, calculates that aggregate earnings for the German stock market will climb by 39 per cent next year. This is the first such rise in five years. What matters to investors is the relationship of earnings to share prices, not the scale of the rise in profits in isolation. The prospective price/earnings multiple for next year is nearly 20. This is high by historical standards: so high, according to Mr Jurgen Rothig of Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Frankfurt 'that you have to start thinking beyond 1995 to justify the current price earnings ratio'. In other words, it will not be next year, nor perhaps even the year after, before corporate performance starts to catch up with current share prices. This has been ignored by investors, especially the non-German investors who drive the market in German shares at the margin. According to recent figures from the Bundesbank US investors alone have invested a net DM3bn in German shares in the first and second quarters of the year. Dietrich Graff at Commerzbank in Frankfurt calculates that foreigners have invested a total of DM11bn in German equities in the first nine months of the year. It is this 'weight-of-money' which has driven the German market to date this year. Conscious that many foreign and domestic institutions are still underweight in German equities, analysts believe that liquidity will continue to flow into German shares despite fanciful valuations, helping to underpin current prices and drive the DAX to new highs. Mr Rothig believes that this leaves the market vulnerable to sudden, unexpected shocks - not in the sense of political instability in eastern Europe (the German market proved indifferent to the coup attempt in Moscow earlier this month) but developments in the domestic political and economic arena. Elections are looming - perhaps the German government will attempt to prime the German economy with public expenditure projects. The impact on inflation and hence interest rates could be dire, he says. He is advising clients to invest in stocks where valuations are secure should there be a reversal, for example in the big banks. Other analysts say that the bull run in large company shares, the favourites with foreign investors, will now give way to outperformance among small-capitalisation stocks. For those scared off by current valuations, Mr Graff at Commerzbank warns that undue caution can be dangerous. 'This year we all made the mistake of under-estimating the market's upward potential,' he says.</p>

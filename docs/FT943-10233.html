			<p>940806 FT  06 AUG 94 / Electricity review due on Thursday Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, will announce the results of his review of electricity price controls on Thursday, his office said yesterday. The review is expected to result in electricity price cuts in 1995-96, and tighter controls on price increases thereafter. The year-long review affects the price of distributing electricity. This accounts for the main part of household bills. Although electricity costs have stabilised and even started to fall in some areas, high prices, profits and salaries have attracted much criticism.</p>

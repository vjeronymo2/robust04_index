			<p>BFN     [Text] Prime Minister-Designate Silvio Berlusconi has given  only an oblique reply to Umberto Bossi's request to suspend the  summit meetings between the heads of the Freedom Alliance: "He  thinks that he needs a pause for thought; however, I will  continue on the path that I have chosen. I received the mandate  from President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and from the voters, and I  must carry out my duty. I will keep the allies informed," he  stressed, "But I will act in accordance with Article 92 of the  Constitution."    Bossi did not attend the scheduled meeting with Berlusconi  and Gianfranco Fini. Fini said that the League "is wrong to  make conditions." The obstacle is still the same one: the  Interior Ministry.</p>

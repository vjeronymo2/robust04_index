			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Associate helps Sirdar rise to Pounds 5.73m HELPED BY a reduction in interest costs and a larger contribution from its associate, Sirdar was able to achieve a rise in profits from Pounds 5.05m to Pounds 5.73m pre-tax for the year to end-June. The shares responded with a 13p rise to 129p. Results were a little better than the directors had hoped for. They said the figures were bolstered by an 'exceptionally good' second half year at Eversure, the ready-made curtain offshoot. Turnover slipped to Pounds 51.97m (Pounds 52.03m). The hand knitting activities ran up an operating loss of Pounds 93,000 (profit Pounds 720,000) while other textile products achieved a rise in profits of over Pounds 1m at Pounds 6.08m. The associate, Acropolis Hotels, chipped in Pounds 284,000 (Pounds 166,000) to profits while group interest charges were reduced from Pounds 910,000 to Pounds 547,000. Acropolis hopes to open a new hotel in 1995. The final dividend is being lifted to 3.7p (3.5p), raising the total from 5.15p to 5.35p. Earnings worked through 18 per cent ahead at 6.89p. At the year end group gearing was down from 23 per cent to 9 per cent.</p>

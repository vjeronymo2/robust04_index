U.S. District Judge Stanley Marcus said the case intruded into the diplomatic  arena. Benjamin Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., was shot to death in Nicaragua  in 1987 when the rebels attacked the rural hydroelectric project he was helping  to build. A year later, his family, with the backing of the New York-based  Center for Constitutional Rights, sued Miami-based Contra leaders Enrique  Bermudez, Adolfo Calero and Aristides Sanchez.  </P></p>

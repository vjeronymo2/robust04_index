			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EX-HUD OFFICIAL'S LINKS TO CHARITY LAUNCHED PROBE  </P> <P> On the night of April 22, 1988, about 50 people attended a $1,000-a-plate  dinner at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Denver to raise money for an obscure  charity called Food for Africa.  </P> <P> One of the speakers was Thomas T. Demery, whose position as federal housing  commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development gave him sway  over millions of dollars in HUD grants and subsidies.  </P> <P> Developers and their consultants knew full well that Food for Africa was  Demery's favorite charity.  </P> <P> A former director of Food for Africa, he had introduced the charity's South  African founder to friends and associates and invited him to a Washington  political dinner in 1987 where he met Maureen Reagan, the President's daughter.  </P> <P> So it was no surprise that the audience that night at the Hyatt was dominated  by people seeking HUD funds or that the dinner itself was organized and paid  for by a former agency official involved in at least 20 HUD-related housing  projects.  </P> <P> An investigation by HUD's inspector general later found that $290,544 in  contributions to the charity over 2 1/2 years -- 50% of all the money it raised  -- came from individuals and firms involved in programs administered by Demery.  </P> <P> The HUD inquiry, however, established no direct connection between  contributions to the charity and the awarding of HUD grants. And Demery, in a  90-minute interview Friday, denied that a link existed and hotly disputed the  way the inspector general calculated HUD-related contributions to the charity.  </P> <P> "The discharge of my duties wasn't linked to anyone who contributed," said  Demery, who left HUD with the change of administrations in January. "The facts  are that I didn't know who contributed to Food for Africa and it didn't help  them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Sparked Inquiry  </P> <P> Nonetheless, the 700-page HUD report on Demery, the charity and a HUD program  for rehabilitating low-income housing sparked a congressional investigation  that has uncovered evidence of widespread mismanagement and political  favoritism within the agency during the Ronald Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> The scandal has mushroomed far beyond Demery and a single housing program to  raise questions about former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr., his executive  assistant, Deborah Gore Dean, and a host of HUD programs.  </P> <P> Dean and her allies have blamed Demery. Demery, now a real estate investment  adviser with Boston Partners in Washington, has hired a high-powered public  relations firm, Hill &amp; Knowlton, to help absolve him of responsibility.  </P> <P> "It was like 'Let's Make a Deal' over at HUD," said Stuart E. Weisberg, staff  director of the House Government Operations subcommittee on employment and  housing, which is leading the inquiry. "The question is who was the big deal  maker? Behind door No. 1 you've got Debbie Dean. Door No. 2 is Sam Pierce. And  door No. 3 is Tom Demery."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Lying Going On'  </P> <P> Pierce has said little. In his only appearance so far, he told the employment  and housing subcommittee on May 25 that he was not a "hands on" manager during  his eight years at the agency's helm. After his appearance, he told reporters  cryptically, "I think there is lying going on."  </P> <P> He has been so secretive that he has refused to provide congressional  investigators with a telephone number where he can be reached.  </P> <P> But he is willing to call them, and they have asked him to testify again,  perhaps as soon as this month, about charges by a former HUD official that he  ordered her to approve a HUD project in Durham, N.C., pushed by a longtime  Pierce friend and a Republican political strategist.  </P> <P> Considerable attention has focused on Dean, the 34-year-old daughter of a  prominent Republican family. She served as Pierce's chief aide until the Senate  refused to confirm her for an assistant secretary's post and she left the  department to become a housing consultant.  </P> <P> Dean declined to testify before the subcommittee, citing her Fifth Amendment  rights. She also declined to be interviewed for this article.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Played Major Role  </P> <P> But other testimony and press accounts have portrayed her as the leader of what  some former HUD executives call a "brat pack" of high-ranking officials in  their 20s and early 30s. She played a major role in running the $5-billion  housing operation, according to ex-HUD officials, during the two years when the  federal housing commissioner's job was vacant before Demery filled it in  October, 1986.  </P> <P> Demery was a former commercial real estate broker in Birmingham, Mich., an  affluent suburb of Detroit. He had been working as a HUD consultant since 1982,  when he set his sights on winning the post of federal housing commissioner, a  political appointment.  </P> <P> Demery said that he had not been active politically before, but raised money in  1984 for Reagan's reelection campaign and began pressing political contacts to  put his name in for nomination to the HUD post.  </P> <P> In early 1986, he offered to host a fund-raiser for George Bush in Michigan but  was turned down. Later that year, he raised funds for the aborted presidential  campaigns of religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp, who now heads  HUD.  </P> <P> When Demery arrived at HUD in late 1986, he quickly ran into conflicts with  Dean and some of her colleagues. "Tom was at war with Debbie almost from the  start," said a former HUD official who considers himself a friend of both.  </P> <P> In the interview, Demery, 39, said that he considered himself a housing expert  and believed that Dean and many others at HUD were inexperienced. Some, he  said, were philosophically opposed to providing good housing for the poor and  near-poor.  </P> <P> "I did not run with the brat pack," said Demery, who is described by friends as  very religious. "I had no desire at all to be even an ex-officio member."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rebuffed by Pierce, Dean  </P> <P> He acknowledged that he tried three times to fire or transfer his deputy, R.  Hunter Cushing, who was a Dean ally and former member of Pierce's executive  staff. Each time, he said, he was rebuffed by Dean and Pierce.  </P> <P> Internal HUD documents show that Demery raised questions about Cushing's  performance and loyalty as early as Nov. 14, 1986. In a memo to Pierce, he  said: "When I call him on the hot line to come to my office, he will usually  call Deborah first to find out what it is I could want."  </P> <P> A source close to Cushing said only that "Mr. Cushing was loyal to the  secretary and felt that Mr. Demery was acting contrary to the secretary's  wishes and pursuing his own agenda." Cushing is expected to testify soon before  Congress and, as a Dean ally, to lay blame on Demery.  </P> <P> The failure to remove Cushing undercut Demery's standing with the remainder of  his staff, according to former department insiders. In the mind of Demery and  others, it also sowed the seeds that led to the inspector general's voluminous  report on Demery, Food for Africa and HUD's moderate rehabilitation program for  low-income housing, known as "mod rehab."  </P> <P> "They didn't drop a dime on me," said Demery, using the colloquialism for  squealing on someone. "They dropped a bag of dimes."  </P> <P> The origins of the inspector general's investigation of the mod rehab program  have not been made public, but in May, 1988, the office initiated an extensive  inquiry that focused on searching for a connection between contributions to  Food for Africa and the awarding of HUD grants.  </P> <P> Mod rehab originally was one of three major programs within HUD that offered  incentives for developers to rehabilitate or build housing for low-income and  moderate-income families, the handicapped and the elderly. The generous  incentives included mortgage guarantees, grants, loans, tax credits and rent  subsidies that easily could top $50 million per project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Competing for Fewer Dollars  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration eliminated the programs for new construction and  substantial rehabilitation and slashed funds for mod rehab. That increased the  competition among developers for the remaining supply of money.  </P> <P> The HUD report and interviews with ex-officials found that developers turned to  two sorts of consultants in their pursuit of mod rehab funds: Republicans with  political connections and ex-HUD officials with close ties to the department.  </P> <P> The going rate for consultants was $1,000 a unit. A consultant who helped land  a grant for a 300-unit project could get a $300,000 consulting fee.  </P> <P> Among those who received money for arranging grants under mod rehab were former  Interior Secretary James G. Watt, who shared in a $300,000 fee for making a few  telephone calls to set up meetings for a developer with Pierce. Joseph Strauss,  a former HUD official, got $1.3 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Receives Tax Credits  </P> <P> Philip D. Winn, current ambassador to Switzerland and a former Colorado  Republican Party chairman, was part of a loose group of ex-HUD officials whose  projects received $29 million in tax credits alone from the federal government.  </P> <P> Strauss acknowledged in congressional testimony that he hired Watt for one  project because of his influence. Strauss also contributed $15,000 to Food for  Africa.  </P> <P> Winn gave $6,000 to the charity, and one of his business associates, Joseph M.  Queenan, contributed $35,000 and organized the fund-raiser at the Denver Hyatt  in April, 1988.  </P> <P> The Denver fund-raiser was timed to coincide with a trip by Demery to the area  on HUD business and it was one of eight events across the country he attended  while a HUD official, according to the HUD report. Each event was organized by  individuals or firms doing business with HUD.  </P> <P> At the Denver dinner, Demery gave a short talk about Food for Africa and about  a trip he made to Mozambique at his own expense in 1986 to view the charity's  efforts to distribute food to starving people. He also introduced Peter  Pretorious, the South African who founded the organization.  </P> <P> "Demery said it was his favorite charity," recalled Barbara MacRavey Richards,  an official in HUD's Denver regional office, who had been told to attend the  event by a superior because it would look bad if the tables were not full.  </P> <P> The turnout was still disappointing, and Queenan, the organizer and former head  of housing in the Denver office, wound up contributing $35,000 to make the  evening a success, according to records and his lawyer.  </P> <P> E. Lawrence Barcella, a Washington attorney representing Queenan, said that his  client had met Pretorious a year earlier and organized the dinner because he  had "come to believe in the charity."  </P> <P> </P> <P> HUD Connection Denied  </P> <P> Barcella said that Queenan basically had promised Pretorious that the event  would raise a specific amount of money. But the lawyer said that the dinner was  not connected with Queenan's extensive HUD business.  </P> <P> "Queenan certainly didn't believe there was any causal relationship between the  contribution and getting favorable consideration from Tom Demery," said  Barcella, who added that Queenan is expected to testify before Congress in the  coming weeks.  </P> <P> The HUD inspector general's office found no direct connection between  contributions to the charity and HUD grants.  </P> <P> While the report was being completed, the office recommended to Pierce in late  1988 that Demery be removed from making decisions on mod rehab grants because  of questions about the charity and a perception of widespread favoritism in the  program.  </P> <P> Demery, in a reply to Pierce, defended the integrity of the mod rehab program  and said that no one had received favorable treatment at HUD as a result of  contributions to Food for Africa.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shift to Other Matters  </P> <P> Although the HUD report kicked off the congressional inquiry in May, the  employment and housing subcommittee has put the issue aside to deal with hotter  matters raised in recent weeks.  </P> <P> Rep. Tom Lantos (D-San Mateo), chairman of the subcommittee, said that he does  not believe laws were violated in connection with the charity. But he said the  contributors were trying to ingratiate themselves with Demery.  </P> <P> "If you had a pattern like this, it is clear that you want to curry favor with  the individual whose favorite charity that is," Lantos said. "Eyebrows can be  raised, but not much else."  </P> <P> Researcher Leslie Eringaard in Detroit contributed to this story.  </P></p>

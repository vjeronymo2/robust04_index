An agreement to  this effect was signed in Budapest today by the chairman of the  managing board of the Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (Bonn), Helmut  Ricke, and the Vice President of the U.S. telephone company  Ameritech, Lou Rutigliano.    Ricke described the largest privatization so far in the  telecommunications sphere in Eastern Europe as an important step  in the country's economic upturn. With German and American  help, MATV is to be expanded into a leading supplier of  telecommunication services in Central and Eastern Europe until  the turn of the century. It was anticipated that the number of  telephone lines would rise from the current 1.5 million to 3.8  million by the year 2001.    According to Ricke, the concession will run for a 25-year  period and can be extended by a further 12.5 years. Telekom and  Ameritech are planning to invest around DM7.3 billion in  expanding the Hungarian telephone system.</p>

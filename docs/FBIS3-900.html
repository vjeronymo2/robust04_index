In a  communique issued today, the parliamentary opposition says it is  with great sadness that it has learned of the assassination of  Harouna Tahirou, a student, following the unwarranted police  intervention on campus, which infringed upon academic freedom.  The communique further states that this odious act should be  blamed entirely on the authorities of the Third Republic, who in  order to ensure their survival no longer hesitate to give orders  which are clearly illegal.    Nigerois can see from these incidents that there is a slide  toward totalitarianism. The Alliance of Forces of Change  government has adopted a dictatorial attitude because any time  social forces demonstrate for their demands to be met, the  authorities systematically resort to imprisonment and violence,  leading sometimes to deaths.    The parliamentary opposition calls on the government to  conduct investigations to find out who gave the orders for this  cowardly assassination so that the culprits can be brought to  justice. Finally, the parliamentary opposition extends its  condolences to the bereaved family and the Niger School Union.    PNT-Albarka [expansion unknown] has also reacted to the 10  March incidents. They issued a communique at the end of their  party's executive committee meeting denouncing, quote, the  tendency of the Third Republican authorities to seriously  violate individual and collective rights as seen in the attempts  to bring the state and private press to heel; the repression  against student and women demonstrators, and intimidation of  unions, end quote. PNT condemns the indiscriminate repression  against the 10 March demonstrators. The attitude which  accompanies this behavior still exists, although people thought  it had been done away with, show that the struggle for the  institution of true democracy is a continuous process.</p>

			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Oil shares UK investors should not be unduly excited by the 5 per cent jump in BP shares yesterday. It was largely inspired by events in the US last Friday, when worries about sanctions against Libya helped push the oil price up by 50 cents and oil shares, including BP, by around 3 per cent. There has been no positive change in the fundamentals for oil prices, so such gains are unlikely to stick for long. Ever since BP's poor results in February, dealers in London have been only too keen to sell to the US market, even when - as last week - that has left them short of stock. A glance at the sector internationally suggests why US investors have doubled their holdings in BP this year to 8 per cent. Whereas the big US oil companies are yielding 5 per cent, compared with the market average of less than 3 per cent, BP offers 8 per cent. The current year multiple on its shares is now an unlikely 31, more than twice that of Exxon. Yet the US market seems unconcerned by the fact that the yield is high for a good reason, namely that BP's ability to maintain its dividend is uncomfortably dependent on a broad economic recovery boosting the oil price. The less sanguine approach of UK investors still has its merits.</p>

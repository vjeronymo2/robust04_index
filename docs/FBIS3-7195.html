The two Koreas have  placed their armies on alert following the U.S. decision to  station patriot missiles in South Korea. Administrator David  Cortin of the Overseas Workers' Welfare Agency said there are  some 6,000 registered Filipinos in South Korea. Cortin said the  contingency plan for these Filipinos has been activated in the  event the situation in Korea worsens.    The Philippine Government is concerned over the breakdown of  U.S-North Korean dialogue over the nuclear arms inspection  issue. Foreign Affairs Secretary Roberto Romulo said the  breakdown in the talks may isolate North Korea which may lead to  a miscalculation from a nuclear perspective. Referring to fears  of war in the Korean peninsula, President Ramos said support  must continue for those seeking the right path to peace.    In the Senate, Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Blas  Ople  said a war in the Korean peninsula can put the Philippines and  other nations under obligation to send combat troops to fight  under the United Nations flag. Ople's fear is shared by Senator  Rodolfo Biazon who warned that moving Asian and UN troops the  frontline will escalate tension which can explode into a full  confrontation.</p>

			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Survey of Enterprise in Wales (7): Springboard for prosperity - Roland Adburgham on efforts to encourage enterprise Explaining why the Wales 2010 report, commissioned by the Institute of Welsh Affairs, had advocated a 'Wales - Land of Enterprise' campaign, Dr Gareth Jones says: 'We felt it critically important to create a positive view of enterprise.' The report, produced last year by a group chaired by Dr Jones, set out to identify how Wales could become one of the most prosperous regions of Europe by 2010. It advocated 'keynote years' with themes to stimulate progress towards this target - beginning with the Land of Enterprise. The campaign has been slow to gain momentum - a launch conference originally proposed for May will take place next month - but Dr Jones stresses it is a springboard for a long-term plan to change the image of Wales over the next decade. Outside Wales, he says, there remains a perception problem. 'There is still an image of miners going home from the coalpit. There are still elements of churches, chapels, harps and singing.' Within Wales, Dr Jones states, 'our aims are the creation of an enterprise culture, to encourage innovation and technology, and to improve education and training. But it is a mammoth task to try to change the culture of a nation stuck in a pattern for 200 years - you can't change it overnight or in a single year.' The need, he emphasises, is clear. 'Wales has the lowest regional income of any region and it has not advanced because the emphasis has been on 'a job is a job is a job'. We want a highly educated labour force which will have higher added value.' He acknowledges the difficulties in convincing people of the campaign's merits. 'Always - particularly in Wales - there is a certain amount of scepticism. It is quite an ambition - but what we are doing has widespread support. We were very concerned to ensure we involved organisations which already existed as part of the process - not to go off on our own tack.' In consequence, a broadly-based, if unwieldy, steering group was set up with over 20 members drawn from leading organisations in the public and private sectors. Mr John Webb, president of Wales Chamber of Commerce and Industry, chairs it. The Wales 2010 report concluded that growth in the Welsh economy would come increasingly from smaller companies, and to achieve this growth there needed to be a climate in Wales that was supportive of enterprise. An emphasis of the campaign, Dr Jones states, is to encourage small and medium-sized companies not only to grow but to remain in Wales. 'There are so many examples of businesses being started and then 'sold over the bridge',' he says, referring to the Severn crossing between Wales and England. There is general concern in Wales at ownership of companies moving outside the principality. Price Waterhouse Wales points out that until Biotrace International of Bridgend floated last November, and the reverse takeover in March of the property company Markheath by TBI, based at St Mellons, five years had elapsed since Wales had had a new quoted company. Dr Owen Jones, who chaired the enterprise taskforce for Wales 2010, comments that, with inward investment likely to play a less vital role in future, 'it is most important to have more companies with their corporate headquarters and decision-making in Wales'. A central objective of the campaign is to set up an enterprise foundation. Although this would require substantial public sector funding to get it off the ground, the foundation would be intended ultimately to make Wales less dependent on public sector leadership. Dr Gareth Jones adds: 'We want to get the young people of Wales by 2010 to say: 'We want to set up our own business.' Attitudes in schools have got to change.' The conference, to be held in Cardiff on October 20, will especially target the 16-25 age group with seminars run by people who have set up their own businesses. Training and enterprise councils in south Wales will participate to promote the Investors in People programme. The effective delivery of advice, whether to young people setting up businesses or to established companies, is an important factor in encouraging enterprise. To simplify matters, the Department of Trade &amp; Industry has been encouraging one-stop shops in England called Business Links, but the Welsh Office is more guarded about this concept. Although the Welsh Office promises start-up funding, it has warned that additional tiers of administration and separate legal entities should not be created - nor should there be new premises. Local authorities, Tecs and others have been invited to submit proposals by the end of this month. 'I only want a response if you can offer a better service with less confusion and bureaucracy,' Mr John Redwood, Welsh Secretary, told them. What has been described as a 'one-stop shop for engineering', and which was welcomed by Mr Redwood, is the Engineering Centre for Wales. This was set up in March - with pump priming from the Welsh Office, Welsh Development Agency, Engineering Council and Royal Academy of Engineering - to enhance the quality of the industry and encourage young people to become engineers. 'We need a new generation of mad inventors and great entrepreneurs,' Mr Redwood said at the centre's launch in a speech recalling Brunel's Great Western railway and Stephenson's Rocket. Neither engineer was Welsh, but that young Welsh people can show entrepreneurial spirit was shown in July, when a team of 11 girls at a Barry comprehensive school won the UK Young Enterprise competition, sponsored by Midland Bank. The company they had formed concerns a faster means of communications than the railways - it makes computer mouse mats.</p>

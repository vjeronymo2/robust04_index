			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RECORD RACK: 1/2 BERNADETTE COOPER "DRAMA ACCORDING TO BERNADETTE COOPER" MCA  </P> <P> Cooper's sense of humor may be cartoon-like, but her musical instincts are  real-life sophisticated, and there's no other black female  singer-songwriter-producer you can compare her to. If anything, she comes  across as the audacious, self-absorbed female equivalent of Morris Day.  </P> <P> Designed to be high-concept, this album is lacking in the drama department,  save for "The Agency Sent Me," on which a harried social worker, frustrated by  the court system and bureaucratic red tape, finds herself responding to a  battered child who tells her:  </P> <P>  I was born to be fierce  </P> <P>  Born to be happy  </P> <P>  Born to be free  </P> <P>  Are you from the agency?  </P> <P>  Lady, would you help me?  </P> <P>  That cut is a poignant surprise from someone you don't associate with such  serious concerns, and it's about as high-minded as Cooper gets. Actually, she's  most convincing on "I Look Good," the best piece of self-promoting comedic-funk  since Day and the Time cut "Cool" back in 1982. That track alone encapsulates  everything you need to know about Cooper and her wonderfully wacky sense of  musical invention. CONNIE JOHNSON  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BARGAIN CORNER: AIR, CAR DISCOUNTS COVER MANY EUROPEAN CITIES  </P> <P> Air Littoral, a French commuter airline, has introduced two new travel passes.  </P> <P> The passes permit unlimited flights on most of the carrier's service to 23  cities throughout France. The only exceptions are some peak-time flights called  "Red Flights." A seven-day pass costs $199, while a 10-day pass is $249. Passes  must be used on consecutive days. Rates are good until the end of March.  </P> <P> Among the cities Air Littoral serves are Paris, Marseilles, Nice, Lyon,  Bordeaux, Toulouse, Brest, Clermont, Perigueux, Pau, Grenoble, Agen, Bergerac,  Le Puy, Vichy, Angouleme and Beziers.  </P> <P> Passes have to be bought in the United States. Contact travel agents or Air  Promotion Systems, the line's U.S. representative, at (800) 677-4277 or (213)  670-7302.  </P> <P> Air Inter, another domestic French carrier, has a more flexible seven-day "Le  France" pass that permits you to choose any seven days to fly within a month.  This pass costs $210. Air Inter serves 36 cities in France, including Paris,  Nice, Marseilles, Lyon, Biarritz and Toulouse.  </P> <P> In general, Air Littoral serves smaller cities than Air Inter.  </P> <P> Air France, in conjunction with Kemwel Rental Car, is offering a special rate  of $39 for one-week car rentals in Europe. To qualify, two passengers have to  purchase round-trip, transatlantic flights from any U.S. city served by Air  France.  </P> <P> The offer, good until March 31, includes unlimited mileage, value-added tax and  full collision-damage insurance with no deductible.  </P> <P> Cars can be picked up at such Air France gateways as Paris, Nice, Rome, Venice,  Milan, Geneva, Zurich, Madrid, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels and  Athens. To avoid a drop-off charge, you have to return the car to the same  Kemwel station where you picked it up..  </P> <P> If you want to drop the car off at a different station in the same country,  figure on a $50 charge. And if you want to give the car back in another  country, the rate is $175.  </P> <P> Car reservations must be made at least seven days before departure from the  United States. JACK ADLER  </P></p>

The 27 missiles, whose withdrawal was completed Wednesday,  came from the strategic Postavi dvision in the north, the head  of ministry headquarters, General Nikolai Churkin, told AFP.    The 54 other missiles still stationed in Belarus, which are  based with two other divisions, must be withdrawn before the end  of 1996, according to bilateral accords between Russia and  Belarus, both signatories of the 1991 START I strategic  disarmament treaty.    Belarus is one of four former Soviet republics with nuclear  missiles stationed on its territory, in addition to Russia,  Kazakhstan and Ukraine.</p>

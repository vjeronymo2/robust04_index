			<p><P> April 29, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WILL ON FAMILY DISINTEGRATION  </P> <P> An example of equivocation commonly used to cover up unpalatable political or  social conditions comes from a leading expert in this genre, George F. Will, in  his column on the disintegration of the family (Op-Ed Page, April 9). Here he  tells us that "The intergenerational transmission of poverty is produced by the  disintegration of the family structure." Feeling the need to back up this  egregious piece of deception, he quotes Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's remark  that " 'poverty had its origin in social behavior,' meaning, primarily, family  structure." For emphasis he repeats, "Today, family disintegration is one of  the principle correlates of poverty." Concluding that it "poses the most  immense challenge to confront American social policy, a problem of  unprecedented complexity. . . ."  </P> <P> After more than a century of vacant gazing into this "complexity," the high and  mighty of this society are still at it, still searching for a plausible  apologia for the scourge of poverty and the way it wrecks family life. In the  distant past it was laid to improvidence and ignorance of the working class.  Later, alcoholism was said to be the primary cause, but even while Prohibition  was in effect poverty was as prevalent as ever. Currently, the crime and drug  culture is alleged to be at fault. All of these tragic disorders are clearly  derivative of insecurity, social alienation, family disintegration, and an  unrelenting poverty that results from a morally reprehensible system of human  exploitation.  </P> <P> Once regarded as the basic unit of society, the broken family is now the  embodiment of a broken and corrupted social order. By covering it all with  vague abstractions and "unprecedented complexities," Will and company admit  that nothing can be done under the aegis of the status quo.  </P> <P> MACK JOHNSON  </P> <P> Hemet  </P></p>

By definition, emissions rate reductions that were mandated prior to title IV's enactment and that are required regardless of whether the unit is a substitution unit are reductions that would have occurred in the absence of the plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agency recognizes the difficulty of determining whether any particular federal or State emissions reduction requirement (whether a tightening or a loosening of emissions limitations), adopted after title IV's enactment, would have been adopted in the absence of substitution plans under title IV. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This is similar to the problem of determining whether voluntary emissions rate reductions after 1990 would have been made without a substitution plan, except that, with regard to federal or State emissions limitations, political factors favoring or disfavoring imposition of the limitations would have to be weighed. Consequently, the Agency maintains that a bright line, based on title IV's date of enactment, should be established and that emissions rate reductions that were mandated by federal or State law adopted after November 15, 1990 should not be treated as reductions that would otherwise have occurred. As explained in the preamble of the November 18, 1993 proposal (58 FR 60956), the most stringent allowable rate for purposes of substitution-unit allowance allocations will be the most stringent rate as of November 15, 1990 after conversion to pounds per mmBtu but without any annualization.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In contrast, State emissions limitations adopted prior to passage of title IV do not raise the same question about whether they would have been adopted in the absence of title IV. Such emissions limitations, e.g., the Massachusetts acid rain law passed in 1985, were in fact adopted in the absence of any federal acid rain program. The Massachusetts statute included a provision stating that the Massachusetts legislature intended that reductions made under that statute be credited to Massachusetts' share of required reductions if a federal acid rain program was established in the future. Massachusetts, Acts of 1985, Chap. 590 &sect;9. Some commenters challenged, as contrary to the intent of the Massachusetts law, the use of the Massachusetts emissions limitations to limit allowance allocations under title IV. However, Congressional intent, not the intent of the Massachusetts legislature, is relevant to interpreting title IV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some commenters argued that the Agency should distinguish between federal emissions limitations and State emissions limitations and consider only federal limitations in allocating allowances to substitution units. They alleged that it is unfair to ``penalize'' utilities in States ``tak[ing] the lead in controlling air emissions'' and that title IV references federal, but not State, emissions limitations. Comments of Dairyland Power Cooperative at 2 (submitted Jan. 26, 1994). However, section 404(b)(5) requires that emissions reductions with the substitution plan be no less than reductions without the plan and does not distinguish between reductions without the plan that are due to State law from those due to federal law. Thus, contrary to the commenters, there is no basis for considering only federal, and ignoring State, emissions limitations in applying section 404(b)(5). Further, the Agency reiterates that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [S]ince reliance on substitution plans is optional and the use of the most stringent allowable rate (in conjunction with the 1985 actual or allowable rate and the [1989 or] 1990 actual rate) to allocate allowances under such plans is necessary to meet statutory emissions reduction goals, it is difficult to see how such use of the most stringent allowable rate could be viewed as unfair to utilities located in States that mandated reductions. This approach simply prevents the creation of excess, new allowances and thereby ensures that reductions mandated by such States are not used to increase emissions elsewhere above the levels that title IV was intended to achieve. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=20 g=1 f=1 --> 58 FR 60956.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Using federal or State emissions limitations to limit a particular substitution unit's allowance allocation raises certain questions, particularly where some emissions limitations are not unit specific. For example, under some State laws (e.g., the acid rain laws for Massachusetts and Wisconsin), a utility has a maximum average emissions rate for its units in the State. Under other State laws (e.g., for New Hampshire and Minnesota), a utility has a total tonnage emissions cap for all its units in the State. Maximum average emissions rates or maximum total tonnage limits allow utilities the flexibility to exceed such maximum rates or limits at individual units so long as the maximum rates or limits are met on a utility-wide basis. Since individual units may exceed such maximum rates or limits, the Agency concludes that it should not treat the maximum rates or limits as the most stringent limitation for each individual unit. However, while utility-wide limitations provide some flexibility, such limitations impose bounds on the emissions of individual units, albeit bounds that depend on the emissions from other units owned or operated by the same utility. There is no basis for ignoring the fact that a unit may have to make emissions reductions because of a utility-wide limitation, just as it may have to reduce emissions because of a unit-specific limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, the final revised rule provides that the Agency will develop a method for using both the unit-specific and non-unit-specific emissions limitations to limit the allocation of allowances to a substitution unit. This method will not treat non-unit-specific limitations as if they were unit specific and will not allow allocation of allowances for reductions that were necessary to meet non-unit-specific limitations. Because there are significant differences among State laws and the manner in which they express non-unit-specific emissions limitations, the final revised rule gives the Agency the authority to develop this method on a case-by-case basis for each proposed substitution unit. This approach will give the Agency the flexibility to take account of variations among States and will allow interested parties an opportunity, e.g., in proceedings on individual permits, to comment on the method that the Agency proposes to use with regard to a particular non-unit-specific limitation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

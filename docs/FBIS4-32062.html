			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Doboj, 19 Jun (TANJUG) -- Muslim units have  resumed attacks on Serb positions and residential areas along  all frontlines in the Doboj region, the information service of  the Srpska republic army's 1st Krajina Corps said this evening.  [passage omitted] For the fifth day running, strong Muslim  forces, reinforced by units from Zenica and Kakanj, are  attacking Serb positions and villages along the Ozren-Vozuca  front. The attacks are focused on the area between the Krivaja  river and the southwestern part of the Ozren-Vozuca front where,  with strong artillery and tank support, the Muslim forces are  launching infantry attacks and using terrorist-sabotage groups  in attempts to break through Serb lines and destroy all Serb  villages. This is why a mass exodus of the Serb population has  begun.    According to the statement, the Muslims are also attacking  Serb defense lines in Vozuca from the direction of Banovici,  Lukavac, Zivinice, and Tuzla. According to the statement, it is  becoming more obvious that the UN Protection Force has been  offering logistical and fire support in the area between Ribnica  and Vijenac. A mass exodus of the population has also begun from  this area after many civilians, mostly children and women, were  killed in Muslim artillery attacks on their villages. [passage  omitted]</p>

			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Macedonian snub for Serbia MACEDONIA yesterday rejected Serbia's initiative to revamp Yugoslavia and vowed to forge ahead with its drive for independence. Mr Nikola Kljusev, the prime minister of Macedonia, one of the Yugoslav republics, yesterday said: 'We do not wish to begin political talks with other republics about creating a new Yugoslavia.' But he added that Macedonia has already held talks on economic co-operation with Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Croatia and Slovenia have already won European Community recognition as independent states. Macedonia and Bosnia, the central republic, have asked for similar recognition but so far have been recognised only by Bulgaria. The parliament of Bosnia yesterday was expected to debate a referendum on independence. Meanwhile Mr Marak Goulding, United Nations undersecretary, is expected to arrive in Belgrade tomorrow to meet UN liaison officers. The 50-member advance team last week was deployed in crisis zones to set up communication links between federal and Croat forces in order to shore up the UN-brokered ceasefire.</p>

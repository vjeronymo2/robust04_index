			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / How to Spend it: Clarice Cliff revisited FANS OF the work of Clarice Cliff will recognise the image pictured here instantly. Of all the designers associated with pottery her hand-writing is perhaps the most distinctive. She became hugely influential in the Art Deco period - even those who have never been collectors will recognise the bright colours and bold Art Deco lines which are her hallmark. Today her ceramics are keenly collected all over the world and fetch high prices in the world's auction rooms - all of which explains Wedgwood's decision to reintroduce 17 pieces all redolent of the high period of Clarice Cliff's work. All follow original Clarice Cliff shapes but it has not always been possible to use exactly the same colours. Nevertheless, all faithfully capture the vitality and boldness so typical of design in the pre-war jazz age. All the pieces are hand-painted using the same techniques that she nurtured among her team of young painters, the 'Bizarre girls' (so-called because the bold range that brought her her most lasting renown was called Bizarre). All 17 pieces are being issued in numbered, limited editions - mostly of 250 each - and prices range from Pounds 150 for the Football vase (from a design originally produced in 1929 and 1930) and a wall plaque (originally produced in 1932 and 1933) to Pounds 250 for a Prunus jar, dating from 1930/31. The famous Yo Yo vases are Pounds 225 each while the conical sugar shakers pictured above (in an edition of 500 each) are Pounds 85. All are on sale now in leading Waterford/Wedgwood rooms.</p>

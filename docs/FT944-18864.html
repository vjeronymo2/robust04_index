			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / UK Company News: ED&amp;F Man 1.2 times subscribed Investors who applied for more than 100,000 shares in ED&amp;F Man, one of the world's largest commodities traders, will receive just 55,000 each. The public offer of 15.3m shares at 180p was 1.2 times subscribed. Some 45.83m shares have been placed with institutions. The shares will begin trading on Friday. Schroders, the merchant bank advising Man, said there had been a wide spread of smaller applications from private investors. Those seeking up to 1,000 shares were granted their full application. Man announced plans to float in August. It was forced to cut its target price after the sharp stock market decline. Man said the relatively modest over-subscription was not surprising. However, analysts have raised concerns about Man's dividend prospects. It is coming to the market on a notional yield of 6 per cent.</p>

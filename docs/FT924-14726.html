			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Exeter Trust alters investment policy EXETER Preferred Capital Investment Trust, which came to the market in January with an unusual structure to invest in the shares of split-capital trusts, yesterday announced a change in investment policy. A larger part of its portfolio will be invested in income shares, because the gross redemption yields on zero dividend preference shares has fallen from more than 11 per cent to about 10 per cent. Yields on income shares, however, are as high as 20 per cent. The prospectus estimate of 341p for the net asset value of the ordinary shares at the end of the company's life in 2002 has been revised to 315p. This is because the price of income shares has fallen on fears of higher interest rates and reductions in dividends. The trust has decided to purchase Pounds 15m of its zero debenture stock.</p>

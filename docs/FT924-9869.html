			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Survey of Portugal (11): TV is no longer a state monopoly - The Media A NEW era opened on October 6 when Portugal's first private television station, SIC, hit the airwaves, thereby ending 35 years of state monopoly. Early next year, SIC (Sociedade Independente de Comunicacao) will be joined by a second private station, TVI (Televisao Independente), which is backed by the Roman Catholic Church. Their fight for survival in an uncertain advertising market pitches them against two stations partly financed by the government and run by RTP (Radiotelevisao Portuguesa), Canal 1 and TV2. SIC is headed by Mr Francisco Pinto Balsemao, a former prime minister and Portugal's only media magnate. Mr Balsemao, whose publications include Expresso, the country's most respected weekly newspaper, has no doubt about the significance of the launch of private TV. 'It's important for the people to be aware of what's going on in the country and the world, and it's important for them to exercise the right of choice, (and) the right to be different, which have not existed until now,' he says. Under the dictatorship which fell in 1974, RTP was part of the regime's propaganda machine. Even after Portugal's return to democracy, the station has been accused of being too close to the government. Mr Jose Eduardo Moniz, RTP's head of news and programmes, says the days of subservience have gone. 'We feel we have changed quite a lot in the last six or seven years, and that we have managed to gain the trust of a large part of the population.' Mr Balsemao disagrees. He is convinced that SIC can be more independent and impartial than his state-run rivals, especially when it comes to news. Surprisingly, his station is taking on RTP's popular Canal 1 with an almost identical prime time programme structure, preceding and following the main evening news with telenovelas, the racy Brazilian soap operas that regularly keep the Portuguese glued to their sets. Advertising analysts warn that this policy of direct confrontation with the state networks contradicts all market rules, but Mr Balsemao is confident. 'We had two strategic possibilities: either to accept that we would be a small alternative television aiming at maybe 10 to 15 per cent of the audience, or the one we have chosen,' he says. SIC's remaining programmes, like RTP's, consist of game and chat shows, subtitled feature films, and mainly American sitcoms and series. Tight finance will also leave SIC with little money to splash out on expensive home-grown productions, especially drama. The government has established tough requirements which all networks will have to meet within three years. Forty per cent of all output must be in Portuguese, three-quarters of which has to be produced in Portugal. RTP, with its Es16bn budget for the current year compared to SIC's projected Es8bn for 1993, will find it considerably easier to meet such targets. So far, SIC's confrontation strategy has been only partially successful. Its news programmes are tighter, more dynamic, and have a more popular appeal. The titles, inspired by Brazilian designers, are slicker and more colourful than RTP's. But telenovela lovers have found that RTP was given first choice of the Brazilian supply, leaving SIC to screen older productions. In fact, Brazil's TV Globo, the main producer of telenovelas, looks like the only clear winner so far by selling its products to all three channels. SIC's capital of Es6bn represents the biggest investment made in Portugal's media industry. Soincom, an investment company controlled by Mr Balsemao, is SIC's largest single shareholder with a 25 per cent stake - the maximum any individual or group is allowed to hold. Foreign participation is limited to 15 per cent, and in SIC's case, this is fully taken up by TV Globo which provided a great deal of technical assistance. Mr Balsemao hopes to break even by the end of the third year and to capture some 30 per cent of TV advertising within five years. This would leave 50 per cent for RTP's two channels and 20 per cent for TVI. But with its 10m inhabitants, Portugal is a small advertising market. Although its economy is expected to expand at a rate above the European Community average, growth has slowed. Portugal's advertising market grew by a sturdy 25 per cent in the first half of 1992, but this is far short of annual growth rates of up to 40 per cent in the second half of the 1980s. Television takes about 45 per cent of all advertising in Portugal, but the future is uncertain, and it is hard to predict whether and how advertisers will increase or shift their budgets. 'Companies will make some efforts to have a bigger advertising budget,' says Mr Carlos Sousa, deputy manager of Universal Media Portugal. 'However, I don't think that growth will be very significant'. Mr Sousa admits to no surprise that SIC has captured a satisfactory amount of advertising for the initial period. 'Everybody is trying to be there for the first few weeks. Let's wait for the audience figures,' he cautions.</p>

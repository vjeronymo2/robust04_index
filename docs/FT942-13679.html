			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / London Stock Exchange: Recs hit by Offer price hint Share prices among the regional electricity companies beat a hasty retreat yesterday after details of the regulator's initial intentions over the review of electricity pricing leaked into the market. Analysts said the tone and detail of the opening exchange, contained in a letter between Offer and the Recs, came as a shock to the market. 'We expected a brisk opening from Offer, but not to the extent of detailing prices,' said one leading utility broker. According to analysts who had seen the letter, Offer's opening recommendation on prices would mean a 15 per cent price cut in distribution charges, plus an annual rise of around 2 per cent below the rate of inflation. Some in the market believe Offer's eventual position will be far harsher than the initial stance and bodes ill for the sector. Others were more sanguine and suggested that Offer would stick to its initial position, at which level the Recs would still manage dividend growth in excess of 5 per cent a year. Among those worst hit, Midlands slumped 27 to 606p, Yorkshire 22 to 587p and South West 23 to 595p. The two recs included in the FT-SE 100, Eastern, 616p, and Southern, 601p, fell 14 and 16 respectively.</p>

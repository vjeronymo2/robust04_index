			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / Recovery is export-led says CSO The UK economy's increased overall output in the third quarter reflected strong net growth in the export of goods and services, but domestic expenditure on these items was unchanged, according to figures from the Central Statistical Office. The CSO yesterday revised downwards slightly its estimates of third quarter gross domestic product growth to a seasonally adjusted 0.8 per cent compared with the second quarter, from 0.9 per cent published last month. Growth in the year to the third quarter was put at 4.1 per cent compared with 4.2 per cent previously. The CSO's analysis of the GDP figures showed how Britain's recovery has become export-led. Total domestic expenditure was flat between the second and third quarters and up 2.5 per cent in the year to the end of September. The improvement in Britain's trade performance was equivalent to the 0.8 per cent third quarter rise in GDP and contributed 1.6 percentage points of growth in the year to end-September. Separate third quarter balance of payments figures revealed a sharp improvement in UK invisible trade, due to higher surpluses from trade in services and investment income. Within the domestic expenditure totals, consumers' expenditure increased by 0.5 per cent between the second and third quarter and was up 2.2 per cent over the year. Overall investment (gross domestic fixed capital formation) fell by 0.6 per cent largely because of reduced investment in dwellings, but was up 2.2 per cent over the year. Manufacturing investment rose 0.3 per cent in the third quarter and was 1.9 per cent higher than in the third quarter of 1993. The CSO's national figures showed that total real personal disposable income increased by 1.5 per cent between the second and third quarters and was 1.5 per cent higher than in the third quarter of last year. Because total income increased at a faster rate than consumer spending, the amount of personal savings in the economy rose. The savings ratio, which expresses total personal saving as a percentage of total personal disposable income, increased to 10.5 per cent in the third quarter from 9.6 per cent in the second quarter and 10.7 per cent in the first quarter of this year. CSO statisticians warned, however, that this reversal of a downward trend in the savings ratio did not automatically signify increased caution among consumers. The growth in disposable income in the quarter largely reflected a big increase in dividend payments. The national accounts statistics pointed to continued health of the corporate sector. Gross trading profits of industrial and commercial companies, after deduction of stock appreciation, rose 2.2 per cent in the third quarter and were 14 per cent up on the year before. These companies ended the quarter with a financial surplus of Pounds 2.7bn, up from Pounds 1.95bn in the second quarter.</p>

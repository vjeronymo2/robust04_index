			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 4 (AFP)--Chinese dissident Bao Ge,  who defied the authorities by setting up a human rights group,  was detained in Shanghai on the eve of Saturday's fifth  anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, a friend said. The  friend said by telephone that several police went to the home of  Bao's parents around 11:00 pm (15.00 GMT) Friday after he had  been to city hall to register his human rights organization.    Bao, 31, has also written to the civil affairs ministry to  officially register the group, which another friend said has 167  members in several Chinese provinces. The association is  demanding free trades unions, religious freedom and compensation  for the families of victims of the Japanese occupation of the  1930s and 1940s and relatives of the Tiananmen victims, the  friend said.    Bao has been under continual police surveillance since May  and his telephone has been cut. Other Shanghai dissidents have  faced the same treatment and at least five have been detained.</p>

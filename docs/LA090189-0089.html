			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE  </P> <P> Multimillionaire publisher Malcolm S. Forbes has a problem: how to celebrate  his 71st birthday next year. "We're busy recovering from the last one," Forbes  said of the extravagant 70th birthday bash staged earlier this month in  Tangier, Morocco, with 700 of his rich and famous friends. Forbes arrived in  Maine this week on his 151-foot yacht, Highlander. "We always wander the Maine  coast before Labor Day," Forbes said. "It's a state of mind, the state of  Maine. Everybody likes to come here." ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

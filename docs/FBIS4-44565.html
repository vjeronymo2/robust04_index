			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant's No. 2 Generator </F> Achieves First Full-Power Operation on 25 March"]    [Text] Since being in a nuclear power generating state and  starting to conduct a power generation experiment on 7 February  1994, in strict accordance with the debugging program and the  requirements of technical regulations, and under the supervision  of the National Nuclear Safety Administration and through the  joint efforts of all the units participating in the experiment,  the No. 2 900MW nuclear power generator at Guangdong's Daya Bay  Nuclear Power Plant completed readjustment experiments in  sequence at 15 percent, 30 percent, 50 percent, 75 percent, 87  percent, and 97 percent of its rated power safely, with high  quality, and on schedule. Comprehensive inspection,  readjustment, and checking of the generator's equipment and  system states led to the generator's performance in every phase  attaining its design requirements. At 1915 hours on 25 March  1994, the No. 2 generator attained full power for the first time.    During the process of debugging operations, the Guangdong  Electric Power Industry Corporation, Hong Kong's Zhonghua  Electric Power Company, and Guangzhou Pumped-Storage Power Plant  provided substantial support and coordination. This was  especially true of the Guangdong Power Grid and the Hong Kong  Zhonghua Electric Power Company's Jiulong [Kowloon] Power Grid,  which, under the difficult conditions of a valley in electric  power demand during the spring season, carefully arranged for  the grid connection plan and guaranteed that the debugging of  the No. 2 generator proceeded smoothly.    According to the original debugging plan, the No. 2  generator  will continue operating in a full-power state and, after  undergoing all types of performance tests, demonstration  operation, and maintenance work, will be placed into commercial  operation.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Spanish insurer advances 14% Corporacion Mapfre, the leading Spanish insurance group, increased pre-tax profits by almost 14 per cent last year to Pta9.2bn (Dollars 65.7m), writes David White in Madrid. Total net premiums climbed 23 per cent to Pta274bn. This partly reflected the impact of exchange rate changes on premiums outside Spain which climbed 37 per cent to Pta90.3bn. Reinsurance rose 30 per cent to Pta86bn.</p>

			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SUGAR BABIES;  </P> <P> ANN MILLER REMAINS TIMELESS . . .  </P> <P> Thirty years ago, the joke circulating MGM studio went like this:  </P> <P> "Too bad about Ann Miller."  </P> <P> "Why? What happened to her?"  </P> <P> "She fell down and broke her hair."  </P> <P> The sophisticates used to deride Miller, with her lacquered hair, powdered face  and sunshiny verve. But most of her detractors are dead or at the Motion  Picture Country House, and Miller goes on. The gams are great, and the toes can  still tap a mile a minute.  </P> <P> She remains a Hollywood landmark at age -- well, it's best to let her tell it.  </P> <P> "My story is kind of weird," she says. "I was discovered dancing up at Bal  Tabarin, a theater-restaurant in San Francisco, when I was not quite 13 years  old. I was very tall, and I had eyelashes and long fingernails, the whole  thing. Lucille Ball and (vaudeville and radio comic) Benny Rubin saw me dancing  one night. That was when Eleanor Powell was at her height.  </P> <P> "RKO was looking for another dancer, and Lucy and Benny saw me doing this  little machine-gun tap thing. They asked me if I'd like to take a test at RKO.  Of course, my mother and I just jumped at the chance. They asked me how old I  was, and I said 18. I had to say that; I was working at almost a nightclub in  San Francisco.  </P> <P> "I stayed 18, literally, for five years. Unfortunately, RKO found out, and they  demanded that I produce a birth certificate. My mother and father were  divorced, and about the only good thing he did for me was to get a birth  certificate -- he was an attorney -- that said I was the age I was supposed to  be. That tacked five years on my age.  </P> <P> "So now people say, 'My, she's got to be 70 years of age.' I'm 67. I wish I  wasn't, but I am. But people say, 'She made her first film at RKO in 1936;  she's gotta be 70-75.' I just say, 'OK, I'm 108. And I still dance.' "  </P> <P> In recent weeks, she's been on the book-selling circuit, hawking the tome she  wrote with Maxine Asher, "Tapping Into the Force."  </P> <P> At her comfortable house in mid-Beverly Hills, she talked about the reasons for  her second book (the first was a 1972 autobiography, "Miller's High Life").  </P> <P> "I decided to write it since Shirley MacLaine had such huge success with her  books and her videos," Miller said. "I thought, 'She's opened the door, and I  might as well walk through it.'  </P> <P> "My book is different from hers. I'm very clairvoyant. Shirley is not  clairvoyant; she was just involved with meeting clairvoyants and getting from  them the experiences that made her books so wonderful. I've had some amazing  clairvoyant experiences."  </P> <P> She related a few. When her father came home late one night, he claimed a  business meeting. Ann, then 3 or 4, corrected him: "Dad, you were having dinner  with that pretty, blond lady." End of marriage.  </P> <P> About her psychic sense: "I can't turn it on, like professional clairvoyants.  Mine is an inner voice that comes to me -- unlike the audible voice in 'Field  of Dreams.' When that voice comes to me, I always listen, because it will save  me from something dangerous."  </P> <P> Miller married three millionaires. All were unhappy experiences. Didn't her  voice warn her?  </P> <P> "Yes, but I wouldn't listen because I was in love. Love does strange things to  people."  </P> <P> Miller was born Lucille Ann Collier in Cherino, Tex. She began dancing at age 5  to strengthen her legs after rickets. After her parents divorced, she and her  mother moved to Los Angeles, where Ann won a talent contest that led to the San  Francisco engagement.  </P> <P> Her first speaking part came in 1937 with "Stage Door," in a cast that included  Katharine Hepburn, Ginger Rogers, Lucille Ball and Eve Arden. She primarily  appeared in B musicals at RKO and then Columbia Pictures. Her glory years came  at MGM.  </P> <P> "My dear friend, Cyd Charisse, fell and broke her leg, and I was tested among  other girls for a role in 'Easter Parade' with Fred Astaire. I won the part.  That picture is what got me the contract at MGM where I stayed 12 years. That  was like being in the 'Ziegfeld Follies.' It was so fabulous."  </P> <P> After the MGM musical era ended, she danced on television and on Broadway in  "Mame." She teamed with Mickey Rooney in a hokey revue, "Sugar Babies," that  lasted 8 1/2 years in New York, on the road and London. It made both stars  rich.  </P> <P> " 'Sugar Babies' brought me the financial freedom that I needed," Miller  reflected, "and it brought me the stardom that I needed. At MGM I always played  the second feminine lead; I was never the star in films. I was the brassy,  good-hearted showgirl. I never really had my big moment on the screen.  </P> <P> " 'Sugar Babies' and 'Mame' gave me the stardom that my soul kind of yearned  for."  </P></p>

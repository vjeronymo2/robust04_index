A container with  approximately 20 m[.sup]3[/] exploded with the escape of  uranium. A radioactive track with an area about 100  km[.sup]2[/] was formed in the terrain. An initial  reconnaissance was made for determining the general direction of  transport and fallout of radioactive substances, followed on  12-13 April by a detailed survey of the snow-covered terrain at  1:100 000. The direction of the survey runs was virtually  perpendicular to the axis of the radioactive track; each run was  20 km long. A map shows the polluted area. The energy release of  the radioactive products was estimated at 4700 R x  km[.sup]2[/]/hour. The total quantity of radioactive products  beyond the limits of the industrial site of the plant was  estimated at 530-590 curies. It is shown that in the most  polluted central part of the track with pollution levels 300  R/hour or more the accumulated dose of gamma radiation from  the radionuclides detected at the time of the survey  (ruthenium-103, ruthenium-106, zirconium-95 and niobium-95) will  not be more than 1 roentgen during the first year. During  subsequent years there will be little gamma radiation from  radioactive pollution. Figures 2.</p>

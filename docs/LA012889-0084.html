			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FIRING GENE SHUE WAS CLIPPERS' BIGGEST BLUNDER  </P> <P> I think the recent firing of Coach Gene Shue was by far the most disgusting  move the Clippers have ever made. It just shows the lack of class of this  organization. Gene Shue has proven to be one of the best coaches the NBA has  ever had. Coaching is not the Clippers' problem. The Clippers need players,  talented and healthy players, not a new coach!  </P> <P> MARGARET GROVES  </P> <P> Cardiff  </P></p>

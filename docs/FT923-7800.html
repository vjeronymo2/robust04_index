			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / International Company News: ING rejects 5% stake in BBL INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company, turned down a chance to buy a 5 per cent stake in Belgium's second-largest bank, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, but reaffirmed its interest in raising its 10 per cent stake. ING is eager to create a second 'home' market in Belgium but yesterday rejected an offer from SBH Investment, a subsidiary of Unipar, the Italian holding company, to acquire its nearly 914,000 shares in BBL at BFr3,800 (Dollars 125) each, about 10 per cent above their current market value. BBL's major institutional shareholders belong to a syndicate which stipulates that members must offer each other the right to first refusal when divesting their holdings. BBL said 'no shareholder in the syndicate decided to buy the shares at the price fixed by SBH Investments'. This leaves the Italian company free to find other buyers for the shares, provided they are sold at BFr 3,800 each. If it lowers the price, it must approach syndicate members again, starting with Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL) which owns a 13.5 per cent stake, but which controls 24.2 per cent thanks to allies Royale Belge and UAP of France. ING said its decision was based on a 'complex of factors' but declined to elaborate. Analysts believe one factor is a Belgian law requiring that a public bid be launched if an investor buys shares at a premium and thereby acquires control of the company. The 5.2 per cent holding would have formally made ING the single biggest shareholder in BBL at 15.2 per cent, ahead of GBL. ING is seeking to conclude an insurance partnership with BBL as part of its European expansion plans, but GBL and some other Belgian institutions would prefer the bank to forge links with the publicly-owned Belgian credit institution Credit Communal.</p>

			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RJR NABISCO HIRES GERSTNER AS CEO;  </P> <P> AMERICAN EXPRESS PRESIDENT TERMED AN EXPERT MARKETER  </P> <P> RJR Nabisco on Monday said that American Express President Louis V. Gerstner  Jr., an executive known for his marketing skills, will join the food and  tobacco giant as its chief executive.  </P> <P> It was a surprise move that analysts said will bring a top-notch leader to RJR,  recently bought in a $25-billion deal by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. He  will replace F. Ross Johnson, the RJR chief executive who resigned after making  a failed bid for the company.  </P> <P> Despite his lack of experience in the food and tobacco business, analysts  praised the 47-year-old Harvard MBA as a smart choice for RJR. "He is  considered one of the best managers in the business in America today," said  analyst Brenda Davis McCoy, who covers the financial services industry for  PaineWebber. "He knows the consumer markets very well and knows how to analyze  consumer tastes."  </P> <P> Henry R. Kravis, a founding partner of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., said  in a prepared statement that Gerstner "has widely acknowledged talents for  developing a comprehensive business strategy and creating a dynamic,  entrepreneurial culture in a large organization."  </P> <P> Analysts say Gerstner, who reportedly will make at least $2.3 million during  his first year at RJR, will have to move fast to deal with the trauma caused by  the recent KKR takeover. KKR has made it known that certain parts of the  company will be sold off "and this creates a tremendous amount of morale  problems," said analyst Roy D. Burry, at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "He has to  talk to people and may have to act rather quickly."  </P> <P> Along with working on the sale of some divisions, Gerstner is expected to  quickly begin reviewing the company's marketing and spending plans. One analyst  predicted that Gerstner would have "complete autonomy" to deal with marketing  and operational matters.  </P> <P> Gerstner, who will join RJR on April 3, said in a news release: "The great  strengths of the company are its people, its brand loyalties, its consumer  franchises and its strong market positions. Together, the people of RJR Nabisco  and I will work to further improve the company, grow it, and make it a creative  and exciting place to work."  </P> <P> Gerstner, who met Monday with RJR executives in the company's Atlanta  headquarters, was not available for further comment. A company spokeswoman said  Gerstner was expected to meet with top managers at the company's divisions in  the next few days.  </P> <P> For American Express, analysts said, the departure may pose some short-term  problems but will not be a major blow.  </P> <P> "They are going to keep growing," said analyst Perrin Long at Lipper Analytical  Services. "But his insights and managerial skills will be missed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Robinson to Step In  </P> <P> American Express officials said that Gerstner's duties will be assumed by  Chairman James D. Robinson III. Aldo Papone, president of the firm's Travel and  Related Services division, will assume Gerstner's title as chairman of that  division.  </P> <P> Analysts say they expect the company to eventually name a new president.  "Whoever takes his place will have an impact on the future strategic direction  of the company," said Davis McCoy.  </P> <P> Some took the news as an omen for American Express, which owns IDS and 62% of  Shearson Lehman Bros. At Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co., analyst Alison Deans  lowered her rating on American Express' stock after news of the Gerstner's  departure.  </P> <P> Word of Gerstner's appointment surprised many industry analysts and even board  members at American Express. "I didn't know it was coming and I don't think  anybody knew it was coming," said one board member, whose initial reaction to  the news was, "Jesus Christ!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Too Good to Refuse'  </P> <P> On Friday morning, Gerstner told American Express' Robinson that he had been  made an offer and would make up his mind by the end of the day, according to  company spokesman Lawrence A. Armour. Later that day, he told Robinson he had  decided to leave.  </P> <P> "Lou left the house in very good order," said Armour. "But the offer was too  good to refuse."  </P> <P> Ironically, it was Robinson who had teamed up with Johnson to make the failed  buyout offer for RJR.  </P> <P> Gerstner, a former consultant with McKinsey &amp; Co., joined American Express  in 1978 as the head of its American Express Card division. His marketing skills  and strategies were credited with triggering dramatic increases in sales and  profits at the once-sluggish division, and his success helped propel him to the  company's presidency in 1985.  </P> <P> But with little chance for Gerstner to move up to the top job at American  Express in the near future -- Robinson is not expected to retire for at least  12 years -- he may have been eager to move elsewhere. "Lou is a very personable  guy," said Long at Lipper Analytical. "But more than anything else, he is a  leader more than a follower."  </P></p>

			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Men in the News: Elderly boss keeps colleagues in place - Dieter Bock and Tiny Rowland Whatever it is that Tiny Rowland takes to keep himself going at the age of 76, it does not come from Body Shop. This week he confronted an incipient boardroom coup at Lonrho, the international conglomerate, and emerged triumphantly unscathed, like some ageing tyrannosaurus crashing through the corporate under-growth. The lesser species who had sought to unseat him, including his fellow joint chief executive Dieter Bock, were simply outmanoeuvred. Thus it ever was at Lonrho, where the choice for Tiny's fellow directors has usually lain between total subservience and total war. The middle ground has always, in the end, turned out to be illusory. The chief casus belli in this instance was the Pounds 5.5m a year that Rowland is said to cost Lonrho in salary and expenses. Along with a basic salary of Pounds 1.2m he receives numerous payments towards the cost of his homes in Belgravia and Buckinghamshire, his domestic staff and even the education fees of dependants of African politicians and business contacts. There is much at stake, it seems, for the public school system in the outcome of the Lonrho succession. The most extraordinary feature of this latest twist in the Lonrho saga is that it so closely resembles the earlier, notorious boardroom row in 1973. That was when Edward Heath, the then prime minister, pronounced anathemas on Rowland by referring to the unacceptable face of capitalism. There, too, part of the argument turned on pay and expenses. And in a subtly managed campaign Rowland routed the so-called 'straight eight' directors who were seeking to throw him out. Much water has passed under the bridge since then, but not a great deal else. In the 20 years after the row turnover increased from Pounds 274m to Pounds 3.9bn, while earnings per share ran the whole gamut from A to B, with a rise from 6.0p to 6.4p. Last year finally saw alphabetic progress in the shape of a jump to 15.1p, but this was levitation. Most of the money was earned in discontinued operations which were shed to bolster Lonrho's cash position. In real terms the share price languishes at around one-fifth of the level it reached at its peak in the bull market of 1968. The one thing that generated a consistent and rising cash flow for most of that time was the dividend policy, which helps explain why Lonrho has always lived on the edge of a never-ending cash crisis. Nor was this at the urging of greedy institutional shareholders. The big insurance companies and pension funds had boycotted Lonrho since 1973, thereby ensuring that Rowland could tyrannise over the tiny stakes of impotent small shareholders, who supported him for longer than anyone else would have thought humanly possible. The chief beneficiary of these over-generous payouts, until Bock arrived on the scene, was of course the biggest shareholder: Rowland himself. Another extraordinary feature of this week's events is the apparent belief of some Lonrho directors that there is a civilised alternative to a damaging row. In any company which was being damaged to the tune of Pounds 5.5m of potentially controversial expenditure a year that premise would be questionable. At Lonrho, where all history indicates that the only way to remove Rowland from the boardroom is with a crowbar, the notion is absurd. The fearsome septuagenarian entrepreneur has too much at stake, starting with the annual Pounds 5.5m and ending with an emotional attachment to Lonrho that is both real and fierce. What is needed for the task is the will - and indeed the skill, since no one is more adept at removing other people's crowbars than Rowland. On the basis of this week's form, Bock would appear to have been rather easily mugged. Nor is it wholly clear that this German businessman is the right man to take Lonrho forward. Whoever runs Lonrho over the next year or two can hardly avoid doing well. As a global ragbag of more than 600 businesses, which are mainly passive hostages to economic cycles and fluctuating commodity prices, Lonrho is an obvious beneficiary of the recovery that is spreading inexorably across the world. With many of its operations in developing countries it can also benefit, in its disposals programme, from the enthusiasm for emerging markets. Bock claims to be a sophisticated investor who has dealt successfully in property and hotels. He should thus know how to shuffle the pack to good advantage. Yet the key to a sustainable long-term strategy at Lonrho lies in managing the assets rather than shuffling them. Last year Lonrho's motor and equipment distribution business and its manufacturing interests had a combined turnover of more than Pounds 900m from which they extracted no profit at all. More than Pounds 500m worth of hotel property generated pre-tax profits of only Pounds 12m. In Britain, where turnover topped Pounds 700m, the pre-tax profit was a mere Pounds 4m. This litany of under-performance could be extended ad nauseam. Bock's past does not suggest that he is the man to address that particular gargantuan task. And from the point of view of outside investors he may appear a mixed blessing in another sense. He maintains business interests outside Lonrho which involve him in potential conflicts of interest. An obvious case in point relates to property, where his participation in a big City of London office development with Lord Palumbo is being undertaken through his private interests. Yet Lonrho is no stranger to property. No doubt the German could argue that the financial commitment would be inappropriate for Lonrho in its present condition. But much of the taint that has afflicted the company over the years, and which prompted the original Department of Trade investigation into its affairs, goes back to the potential conflict between Rowland's private and public interests. Once again history appears to be repeating itself in an uncanny way. Last October Rowland said of his adversary, in a characteristic outburst: 'I'm still waiting for some performance from him. So far he hasn't delivered a stroke of business. Frankly, he hasn't a clue.' Maybe or maybe not. But Bock does have more than 18 per cent of the capital of Lonrho, together with a right to acquire most of the remaining 6 per cent or so owned by Rowland. Meantime two long-standing Rowland supporters on the board, chairman Rene Leclezio and deputy chairman Robert Dunlop, are due to retire. This suggests that Bock will in due course feel able to rise to the challenge. But before he takes a new crowbar to the greatest carnivore in British business he would do well to prepare the ground with more care. An excellent precautionary move would be to feed the vegetarians in the Lonrho boardroom with a steady diet of good red meat. In the country of the bland, even a 76-year-old tyrannosaurus stays king.</p>

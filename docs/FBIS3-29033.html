			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 11 February Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Some business leaders have given high marks to the  draft 1994 budget presented by the Finance Ministry, saying it  has given considerable consideration to spending for economic  recovery despite tight financial conditions. Gaishi Hiraiwa,  chairman of Keidanren [Japan Federation of Economic  Organizations], said: "I frankly welcome it since it has given  major consideration to spending related to public works  projects." Business circles have urged the government to  compile the third supplementary budget and the fiscal 1994  budget -- which together cover "a 15-month period" -- to avoid  budget interruption. Also, there have been strong demands  within business circles for further cuts in expenditures.    Business leaders are divided over whether the allocation of  outlays for public works projects have been fully reviewed in  the draft budget. Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber  of Commerce and Industry, spoke highly of the draft budget,  saying: "It has placed emphasis on spending for housing and  sewerage construction, which will lead to a higher quality of  living for the people." Meanwhile, Osamu Uno, chairman of  Kansai Economic Federation, said: "I do not see any remarkable  results in the draft," and added, "I expect the government to  drastically review the fixed budget allocation."    Masaru Hayami, chairman of Keizai Doyukai [Japan Association  of Corporate Executives], said: "Drastic cuts in expenditures  should be sought through a complete review of outlays for  individual ministries and agencies."    With regard to negotiations between the Foreign Ministry and  other government offices over reinstatement of budget requests,  Hiraiwa said: "While taking international relations into  consideration, the government should invest more money in a new  social infrastructure such as science and technology, housing,  information communication, and welfare." In this way, he  indirectly noted the need to review defense and Official  Development Assistance budgets.    Commenting on the 2.4-percent growth for the fiscal 1994 GDP  [gross domestic product] forecast by the government, Hayami  said: "This is a very high estimate. From our viewpoint, it is  almost impossible to achieve such rapid growth. The government  should devise measures to accurately forecast the actual state  of the economy."</p>

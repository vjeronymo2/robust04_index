			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / US verdict disappoints Ramos PHILIPPINE President Fidel Ramos yesterday expressed disappointment over a US federal jury verdict clearing Westinghouse Electric of bribery. An elated Mrs Imelda Marcos said the decision vindicated her late husband, AP reports from Manila. The jury on Tuesday found that Westinghouse and a New Jersey engineering company paid no bribes to the then President Ferdinand Marcos to win a nuclear power contract, an allegation made by the government of President Corazon Aquino, his successor. Mr Jess Sison, presidential spokesman, said the Philippines would continue to pay back a loan from Westinghouse for the Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.5bn) the plant cost in 1976. Daily interest alone costs Dollars 300,000 and the principal is the biggest single portion of the country's foreign debt burden of Dollars 30bn. Mr Francisco Villa, state prosecutor, said the government would appeal against the verdict. The 620MW nuclear plant on the Bataan peninsula, the country's only nuclear power plant, was completed in 1985 but never started up by the Aquino administration. The Marcos family faces more than 80 criminal and civil charges in the Philippines in connection with alleged corruption, but none of the trials has been completed.</p>

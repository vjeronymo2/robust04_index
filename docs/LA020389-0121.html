			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COLD WAR IS NOT OVER'  </P> <P> President Bush's national security adviser's statement that "the Cold War is  not over" makes me wonder whether or not the Cold War warriors are in the  saddle once more in the new Administration.  </P> <P> If the majority of the American and Soviet peoples are basically for an end to  the arms race and peaceful coexistence, why are Scowcroft and Sen. Sam Nunn  (D-Ga.) afraid of Gorbachev's "peace offensive?"  </P> <P> Is it because they don't want to decrease the profits made by the  industrial-military complex in armaments appropriations, even though this would  mean a chance to decrease the budget deficit and appropriate more money for  housing, health and education?  </P> <P> SAMUEL HOFBERG  </P> <P> La Jolla  </P></p>

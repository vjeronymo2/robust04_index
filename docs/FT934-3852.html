			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Cementone reverses into Multitrust Cementone, the specialist paints and building chemicals manufacturer, is coming to the market through a reverse takeover of Multitrust, the property investment company. The transaction, involving a Pounds 2.8m rights issue and the disposal of Multitrust's Pounds 3.2m investment portfolio, is expected to value Cementone at up to Pounds 20m. The company decided to follow the reversal route following a failed attempt last year to expand by acquiring a rival supplier. Mr Alfred Baxendale, managing director, said Cementone had persuaded its parent company, UB International, owned by Mr Vijay Mallya, the Indian entrepreneur, that its future growth depended on going public. 'Mr Mallya sees this as the best way forward. Without it growth might have been restricted,' Mr Baxendale said. Cash raised by the takeover, which is due to be completed by the end of January, will be used to buy the freehold of the manufacturing plant and to finance acquisitions. In the year to December 31 1992, pre-tax profits almost doubled to Pounds 995,000 (Pounds 518,000) on flat turnover of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 17.3m). Pro forma profits in the current year are expected to approach Pounds 1.5m. Mr Kenneth Prenty, finance director, said Cementone's performance had improved despite a 35 per cent contraction in the market for specialist paints and building chemicals in the last three years. The new board will be chaired by Mr Alan Clements, former group finance director at ICI, with Mr Mallya as deputy. Mr Andrew Perloff, chairman of Multitrust, will be a non-executive director.</p>

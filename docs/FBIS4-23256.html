			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with President Yoweri Museveni by Mark </F> Huband in Kampala on 5 May]    [Text] Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, called on rebel  forces in Rwanda last night to allow a limited foreign military  intervention to stop the carnage which has left up to 200,000  people dead in the country -- and he became the first leader in  the region to accuse Rwanda's government openly of using  genocide to eliminate opposition.    President Museveni has close ties with the anti-government  Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) and his call for a foreign role is  likely to have a strong impact on it.    The rebels have condemned the United Nations for all but  pulling out of Rwanda when the killings began in early April,  and then planning a return which could halt the rebel advance  through the country.    President Museveni condemned the current government in  Rwanda  for its involvement in the slaughter but called on foreign  countries, and the UN, to understand the real nature of the  crisis before sending in troops.    "The international community -- some of them don't know that  it is the policy of government (in Rwanda) to use genocide as an  instrument of eliminating opposition. I think if there was that  understanding then the view of the situation would change.    "Everybody would know that it is a criminal band, just like  the Nazis, (which is responsible for the killing), and then the  whole international community would hunt them down," he said in  his first interview with a foreign newspaper since the Rwanda  crisis erupted on April 6.    "But I think there could be a basis for some limited involve  ment; for instance, on purely humanitarian issues --  distributing food, rescuing civilians threatened by the  massacres promoting a dialogue among the parties -- for a  limited period, not indefinitely, and without attempting to  influence the politicians of the countries."    He stressed that the RPF should accept such an intervention,  as its forces could not move quickly enough to save lives still  under threat from government death squads operating in the  capital and the south and west of the country.    "The RPF needs to give the chance to the international  community. Because now people think it,s merely a struggle for  power by the two groups."    The UN secretary-general, Butrus Butrus-Ghali and the  Americans have discussed the Rwanda crisis with President  Museveni. Uganda has been accused by the Rwandan government of  supplying the RPF with arms. This has been denied by President  Museveni, whose close ties with the RPF stem from the support  its personnel gave him during the civil war which brought him to  power in 1986.    But his approval of an intervention stems as much from  concerns about the Rwanda crisis spilling over into neighbouring  countries, particularly Burundi, as it does from the impact on  Rwanda itself.    "The Rwandese parties, and the parties in Burundi, must know  that mismanagement in their countries also affects other  countries. So they cannot say their problem is entirely  internal... Genocide isn't part of internal affairs. Internal  affairs is how you govern yourself. But genocide has never been  part of internal affairs."    The impact of the failure of the American-led UN military  intervention in Somalia last year continues to dominate  discussions about the appropriate response to crises.    "One weakness of international involvement is that they  don't  talk on the basis of justice," the Ugandan leader said.    "They don't ask the question of who is right and who is  wrong  in this case. They just come and want to smother the problems  -- to put a canvas over rotten eggs. And as long as the smell  in the room is suppressed then the problem is solved."</p>

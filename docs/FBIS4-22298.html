So in this article we shall talk about democratic  parties and movements. No matter what they are--"dishevelled or  clumsy" like all of Russia--they already mean quite a lot in  real life. Let us take a look at how the future of the largest  of them, the Democratic Russia (DR) movement, is taking shape.    DR is the only all-Russia, mass, democratic political  organization that was not created by a leader, but was organized  from below by uniting many initiative groups in nearly every  region of Russia. This is why its policy toward reform is  stable, a policy that has survived two sets of deputies, several  governments, and several policies of the President of Russia.  During the 1989 and 1990 elections, the predecessors of  Democratic Russia won the elections, and during the presidential  elections and the April 1993 referendum the DR policy won out in  Moscow and in the largest cities.    DR is the only democratic organization capable of calling  for  a mass meeting. The most important work of DR, however, is  practically unknown to the public. This work included the very  difficult and thankless task of DR factions opposing the  majority in former Soviets; conducting deputy activities in  okrugs; formulating a law on privatization, struggling for  privatization with the directing staff of the Supreme Soviet,  and achieving a compromise on privatization; struggling with  officials for civilized privatization, instead of the one which  is often harsh and leads to court cases; and fighting much more  effectively than many other parties that are keen on  privatization.    Naturally this is why political opponents have directed  their  fire on Democratic Russia. Some "buried" us, not noticing the  true state of affairs, effusively described splits (Wouldn't we  be great if we had not parted with Travkin, Aksyuchits, and  Astafyev!). Others called us the ruling party and held us  responsible for all past misfortunes. They placed us in the same  ranks with extremists. They blamed us for reckless support of  the government.    Does DR still exist and whom does it represent? Is  Democratic  Russia's participation in the Vybor Rossii (VR) [Russia's  Choice] bloc an error or a necessity? How should DR approach the  very necessary union of democratic forces? What should DR's  position be with regard to the Russia's Choice bloc and to the  party organized by its leadership?    In May 1993, A. Murashev, A. Golovkov, and member of the  Coordinating Council (CC) of Democratic Russia P. Fillipov  conducted a campaign out in the regions against the cochairmen  and the CC of Democratic Russia. They spread rumors about DR's  degradation, but embraced its organizational structure with all  their hearts. Everything would have been normal if they had been  guided by the charter on reelections within DR. However, they  won over people and entire organizations to their side, tempting  them with promises of assistance from the directors of  administration and the President's representatives.    June. The inevitability of early elections was obvious and  the unity of democrats was essential. Upon the initiative of  DR's cochairmen, the formation of "Russia's Choice" bloc was  proclaimed. Those who had been talking against Democratic Russia  turned up as well, not in leading positions, but nonetheless in  key positions. However, there was still hope that common sense  would prevail, as would the authority of the bloc leaders: Ye.  Gaydar and S. Kovalev. Does this mean that Democratic Russia  should have gone out on its own, by itself? No! Accusations of  fomenting a split would have poured in.    October had already come. Less than two months remained  before the elections. Democratic Russia organizations in Moscow  and Petersburg stood their ground. In many other regions they  fell apart, and organizations of Russia's Choice movement--with  large losses of members--were formed out of what was left. In  some regions, Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia movements  organized Democratic Russia blocs; in others (Chelyabinsk and  Novosibirsk), they were fighting each other. The organizers of  the founding congress of Russia's Choice bloc, using  apparatchiks' methods, secured a majority for themselves and  demonstratively tried to squeeze Democratic Russia out of the  bloc. They were still in a state of euphoria from their October  "victory" and from the pre-election polls. A mixture of snobbery  and unprofessionalism is deadly for politicians and prevented  them from understanding that Democratic Russia's scandalous  departure would lead to the defeat of not only DR, but the rest  of the bloc as well. DR, however, understood this, absorbed the  degradation, and did not leave the bloc. Representatives of  Democratic Russia made a two-hour stand at the front entrance of  the congress hall and "participated" in the work of the congress  using guest passes.... As was to be expected, the federal list  of the bloc did not leave any spaces for DR leaders. Many people  in DR still remember that congress as the most degrading  experience in their lives.    November. Candidates were being selected in the majority  okrugs. Of course, the executive committee of the bloc was  obliged to take into consideration the interests of all bloc  participants. But, for the sake of satisfying them, can regional  organizations be saddled with deliberately unacceptable  candidates and provoke these organizations into a fight with the  bloc? It is true that there is one objective justification to  the arbitrariness of the bloc's leadership--the most terrible  time factor.    December. The majority of Democratic Russia's territorial  organizations, knowing the true situation within the bloc, were  still pressing for DR candidates, because the alternative would  have been defeat for the democrats. Also, many candidates were  still our own people, and many who had been "let go from up  above" were not bad at all. As always, fresh forces joined DR  organizations during the critical moments and saved its ability  to function. People who were hit the hardest by reforms, who  bore the brunt of the disintegration of science and industry,  and who did not receive any pay for months at a time were the  ones who agitated for reforms, passed out leaflets, and  volunteered as observers at polling places. Small businessmen,  crushed by racketeers and taxes, and who long ago parted with  their illusions of a "democratic" administration, contributed  funds in support of Russia's Choice. Now these are the real  intelligentsia, the gold reserve of democracy!    As long as people like this exist, Democratic Russia will  exist and will have the honor to represent them!    On the eve of the elections, however, A. Murashev, wasted  his  journalistic fire not against Zhirinovskiy or Zyuganov, but  against the people who were his allies in the bloc: "Actually,  DR has already completely degenerated. It consists of marginal  groups without any local support whatsoever.... The people who  have remained there are not wanted by anyone else; they are  inadequate and useless. Incidentally, many of them had been in  important organizations, but were removed either for  malfeasance, poor work, or unprofessionalism" (NOVOYE VREMYA No.  46, November 1993). There is no doubt that personnel in  Democratic Russia are very varied not only in the different  regions, but also in the different districts of Moscow. There  are "marginal" people. But are we going to give them to  Zhirinovskiy? No one has the right to offend people, especially  the "removed" chief of Moscow's Main Directorate of Internal  Affairs and failed candidate for cochairmanship of DR. The  executive committee and the leaders of Russia's Choice bloc,  however, have not found the time to tell him "fie on you," not  even very softly.    Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, as well as Popov, are like the  generals  in the film about Fanfan the Tulip who turned their backs to the  enemy. So is it any wonder that in leaving DR, the participants  of the movement did not go to Murashev? Or that leaving Gaydar,  the voters did not go to Yavlinskiy, Shakhray, or Popov? The  humbled and the insulted: Some with their professional  unwantedness and poverty that contradict all common sense, and  others with their cynicism and demogoguery of democrats. Some  wandered over to Zhirinovskiy, others sent everyone to ....    In the post-election hysterics, everyone is silent about the  fact that in Moscow and Petersburg and other large cities the  democrats won again. In Moscow, the Russia's Choice slate won 34  percent of the votes and all the democratic slates won 54  percent, while the red-brown candidates won 24. In elections to  the State Duma, Russia's Choice won in 11 majority okrugs out of  15 in the capital; to the municipal Duma--19 out of 35; and in  those okrugs where Russia's Choice lost, democrats still won  nearly everywhere. Moscow voters have nothing to be sorry about.    But now that the elections are over, shouldn't Democratic  Russia leave the bloc? No! Factions in the State and Moscow  Dumas cannot be destroyed. The romantic times are over when we  divided people into bad bolsheviks and good democrats. Russia's  Choice movement is our ally not because of the personal  attributes of the leaders, but because of the political niche  Russia's Choice occupies.    As long as Ye. Gaydar determined the government's policy,  his  actions responded to the strategic interests of the country. In  the present situation, government actions respond mainly to the  interests of large monopoly capital emanating from officialdom  and "directors'" circles. These are also the interests of  Russia's Choice movement, perhaps with great support from  officialdom. If Russia's Choice bloc had won the elections and  formed the government, Democratic Russia would probably have  distanced itself from Russia's Choice, in order to defend  anti-monopoly measures and the interests of the intelligentsia  and small and medium-sized business. The difference between  social support of Russia's Choice and Democratic Russia has  washed away and is not always realized; it feeds the  disagreements between them. But now the government is inclined  to lean on the huge capital that comes from the CPSU,  monopolies, and "red landowners." Both Russia's Choice and  Democratic Russia showed up in their roles of opposition, and  they are trying not to give the government totally away to left  radicals.    One important result of the past electoral campaign: The  rank-and-file members of Democratic Russia showed a conscious  need for better organization. The word "party" still causes some  to have an allergic reaction, but the essence, after all, does  not lie in the word itself. The uncertainty existing within DR  with regard to membership is already recognized as an  anachronism. It has become clear that it is weakening the  movement, and at the same time does not lead to democracy within  the movement (as it seemed to do earlier), but on the contrary,  gives free play to apparatchik games. Let us say that a chairman  is elected by an organization with an undetermined number of  members by random (or selected) members during a meeting. If the  organization has a fixed membership, a real majority elects him.  Membership dues are also considered necessary.    The time for Democratic Russia's reorganization has come. On  February 19th the plenum of Democratic Russia's Council of  Representatives approved these recommendations for the regional  organizations. It is possible that this action, and not the  arguments about forming a party, was the main result of this  plenum.    The attitude of Democratic Russia's plenum toward the  proposal of Russia's Choice parliamentary faction to create a  united party was not monosemantic. No one denied the necessity,  in principle, of forming a party. But how does one do it? The  way is direct and obvious: Dissolve Democratic Russia and  Russia's Choice, and charter a party. The authority of Russia's  Choice leadership, however, was undermined by a feeble  pre-election campaign, and the crushing of Democratic Russia in  the regions, and insulting it at the congress. Apprehensions are  strong that local officials--on whom Russia's Choice now depends  and with whom there is now a tough struggle prior to elections  to local organs of power--will crush Democratic Russia and  furthermore, will compromise the organization to the voters.    Should a party be formed without Democratic Russia or  Russia's Choice? Such a party would draw the activists out of  Democratic Russia, totally tie it up with a neo-nomenklatura and  quickly degenerate. Democratic Russia, then, devoid of activist  members, would also quickly disintegrate. If, however, the  activists would simultaneously remain in Democratic Russia, its  fate would be the same as that of a trade union led by the CPSU.    Either of these choices, and even raising questions about  them, are fraught with the danger of splits and losses of  members.    It is simply unprofessional to try to create a mass  organization from above. Futile are the hopes for a new personal  party that would be free of the usual shortcomings. Therefore,  my esteemed gentlemen, if you think of yourselves as candidates  for political leadership positions, work in your existing  organizations, reorganize, attract new people into it, and play  on your team and win.    At the same time, in my opinion, no leader has yet grown up  in the Russian political elite who would be capable of heading a  mass democratic organization in a professional manner. The last  several months have shown this especially clearly. The present  leading politicians have become too accustomed to being locked  into a tight circle. Democratic Russia scares them with real and  imagined shortcomings and a somewhat scandalous image. If,  however, they are ready to join Democratic Russia, they try to  gain leadership positions without having done anything either in  Democratic Russia or for Democratic Russia. They are  characterized by their inability to obtain support of mass  organizations (not only at critical times, but every day,  constantly), make use of the extensive information these  organizations have, respect their opinions, and show concern for  their material and intellectual resources, and their authority.    In my view, if a party is to be formed, it should be formed  within Democratic Russia but, of course, not repulse those who  do not want to join. This would not require large organizational  efforts and would not disrupt Democratic Russia's present  political work in the regions.    Unfortunately, a large part of Democratic Russia's  leadership  does not want this. The possible reason is that now, after a  lack of success during the elections and in relations with  Russia's Choice, the majority of the members of the Coordinating  Council and the cochairmen would probably be replaced,  regardless of whether they were personally at fault. These are  smart and active people who cannot go into the shadows and who  are already tied into forming a parallel party. In other words,  they are behaving in the same way as the founders of Russia's  Choice movement behaved only recently.    Democratic Russia also has many other vitally important  problems. It is time, finally, to acquire buildings, finances,  and a newspaper. We need working groups and seminars to develop  programs, tactics, solutions to regional problems, reforms, etc.  At one time we relied on an interregional group, then on  councils, and then on the President and the government. It is  now clear that without a material and intellectual economic  base, Democratic Russia will remain an errand boy for whoever  will condescend to go down to the poverty-stricken movement.    Money is needed for all this, not only three days before  elections, but constantly. Money can be given only by  businessmen who are interested in stability, a normal social  climate, an open market for real estate, and control over  racketeering by officials. Businessmen's specialty is to make  money, not politics. Politicians whom they trust should decide  which organization should get the money.    Resolving these problems will also have an influence on  whether Democratic Russia will be able to form blocs with others  without self-destructing (and it is necessary to form blocs) and  whether it can, in an extreme case, go into the next All-Russia  elections independently. To enter into blocs and alliances  either as a strong unified force or as a scattered force and  lose half your people are the only alternatives, not only for  Democratic Russia, but for the entire democratic movement.    The time of revolutionary romanticism has ended.    We no longer idealize each other, the deputies, the  government, the President, or Russia.    At the same time it has become clear that the opportunities  for state power in a democratic society are limited. No one can  or should have "all the power." This is bad. After all, one  really wants to win elections and improve society with one  swoop! This is good and necessary because it excludes cataclysms  and abuse of power even by legitimate authorities. What  government cannot and should not do can be done by society  itself within the possibilities granted it by organizations from  below.    In our country, however, democratic limitations of power  have  been imposed by degrading authoritative and power organizations,  due to corruption, unprofessional conduct, and poverty. All  hopes rest on bringing reforms down to the ordinary citizen, and  on his interest and active work, for attaining a structured  society. All this, notwithstanding our tiredness and poverty.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statements by Press Director Carlos Calderon to </F> correspondent Roberto Reyes at the Government House in  Tegucigalpa -- live]    [Text] [Reporter Romulo Matamoros] According to the  authorities, Honduran citizen Luis Hernandez Sosa and Nicaraguan  citizen Luis Rene Quintero, who entered our country on 7 March  through El Paraiso, are involved in an attempt against the  president. Quintero also mentioned the names of Nicaraguan  citizens Roger Arguello and Santiago Rivas Betancourt. They are  reportedly in our country engaged in irregular activities  related to drug trafficking and the illegal trafficking of  vehicles, according to Nicaraguan officials.    [Station announcer] Thank you very much. We now have another  report from the Government House. Go ahead, Raul Valladares.    [Valladares] Roberto Reyes is here with Carlos Calderon,  press director of the Government House. Go ahead, Roberto.    [Reyes] Thank you very much. We are here with Press Director  Carlos Calderon at the Government House. I asked Colonel Romero  if this threat could change the president's agenda. What is  your opinion?    [Calderon] We were with the president listening to the  information broadcast by Voz de Honduras Network. Everything is  absolutely quiet. I received reports that military intelligence  officers had informed the president a few days ago about what  was happening.    The president told me he hoped this report would not cause  great alarm because he knows [words indistinct] state security  organizations. He added that he did not think this incident  would have any political significance.    As Col. Romero stated, these individuals were acting like  common criminals [words indistinct]. They do not have any  political connections. Therefore, the president expressed  [words indistinct] with great responsibility. Despite the fact  that the president learned of this situation days ago, the  matter was kept secret, especially since the investigations had  not concluded.    Now that the information has been made public, the president  is quiet. He thanked those who expressed their solidarity with  him and hoped the citizens would view this as a normal thing for  the president. He said he hopes the incident will not alter his  working schedule. President Reina is not worried at all about  this situation. He knows that the state security organizations  are efficient and that he has the support of the people. He  knows he is a loved and respected individual. Reina is aware  that these things can happen to any president: They are part of  the risk of holding such an important post as the presidency of  the Republic.    This will in no way affect the president's duties and  everyday activities.    [Reyes] Will the president increase his security now?    [Calderon] State security organizations have recommended  that  the president take some precautions, and certain steps have been  taken. For the president, this is no cause for alarm, and it  will not affect his duties. He is quiet, relaxed, and will  continue his normal activities.    [Reyes] Has the president downplayed the information given  to  him?    [Calderon] I wouldn't say so. I would say he has handled the  information appropriately. He has given this report the  attention it deserves. He has taken the recommendations made by  state security agencies into account [words indistinct] but he  will not change his routine and how he relates to the public.  This does not involve a change in the president's behavior as  head of state.    [Reyes] How has the president classified these actions? You  are talking about crime, but how does he see the situation?    [Calderon] We have the same information supplied by state  security organizations. When one talks about common crime, one  implies there is no link to political groups. This is a  unpremeditated action by a group of individuals who, for unknown  reasons, have considered taking such actions. These actions do  not reflect the political criteria or actions of any group,  which would have given the problem a different look.    [Reyes] Has the president received calls from presidents or  foreign officials other than the Nicaraguan Government Ministry  official who contacted you?    [Calderon] No. The president has only received local calls.  I suppose that when the news spreads, presidents of friendly  countries will express their solidarity with the president. You  are well aware of the enormous respect for President Reina  throughout the continent.    [Reyes] What have the Armed Forces told the president?    [Calderon] I don't know anything about that.    [Reyes] Thank you very much.</p>

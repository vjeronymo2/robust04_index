Liu Zhongde stressed the necessity of increasing the  intensity of reform of the cultural structure and to open up a  new situation for cultural undertakings.  <H3>  A Year in Which More Measures Will Be Taken in Reform of the  Cultural Structure and the Intensity of Reform Will Be Greater  Than Any Other Year </H3>   The reporter asked: "Is this year a year in which more  reform measures will be taken by the Ministry of Culture and the  intensity of reform will be greater than any other year?" Liu  Zhongde gave an affirmative reply. He said: The year 1994 is a  crucial year for the comprehensive advancement of and for making  key breakthroughs in reform of the economic structure in our  country. This has made speeding up and deepening reform of the  cultural structure even more pressing. Speeding up and  deepening reform of the cultural structure is not only to meet  the needs of the overall situation of reform of the economic  structure, but also to meet the needs of invigorating and  developing socialist literary and art undertakings. If we say  our work in the past year was to make necessary discussions and  preparations for speeding up and deepening reform, this year  should then be a year for making greater progress and obtaining  considerable results in reform.    He explained with examples that the internal organizational  reform of cultural organs should be completed this year. Such  reform includes changes in the functions of government work.  This means the mode of management which is suited to the  planned economy structure of the past should be shifted to the  mode of management which is suited to the market economy  structure. The leadership of cultural work should gradually  change the practice of regarding micro management as the  dominant factor to the practice of regarding macro management as  the dominant factor, should concentrate major efforts on giving  guidance in direction, grasping general quantity and quality,  structure, and results, and should learn and master the  comprehensive use of economic, legal, and administrative means  and public opinion to guide the healthy development of cultural  undertakings. Besides, this year we should also complete the  structural reform of cultural institutions. Arts institutes and  schools directly under the Ministry of Culture, for example,  have already finalized reform plans and have started  implementing such plans.  <H3>  Reform of Artistic Performance Organizations Is of Paramount  Importance to Reform of the Cultural Structure </H3>   When asked by the reporter the focus of the reform of the  cultural structure this year, Minister Liu replied: It is the  structural reform of performance organizations, including the  structural reform of artistic institutions and troupes directly  under the central authorities. Reform in this respect is of  paramount importance to the entire reform of the cultural  structure.    He said that in September last year, the Ministry of Culture  issued a "Circular on Further Speeding Up and Deepening the  Structural Reform of Artistic Performance Organizations," which  put forward views on the reform of artistic performance  organizations, including the general layout, the leadership and  management structure, the personnel system, the wage system, the  management in giving performances, and ideological and political  work. This year, we want to advance reform in a big step  forward and to earnestly make some achievements.    When the reporter asked Minister Liu to give details on the  structural reform of organizations directly under the central  authorities, he replied that we are concentrating our efforts on  the reform of artistic institutions and troupes directly under  the central authorities. This has been the key and difficult  point in the reform of the literature and art structure for many  years. At present, we are tackling substantive problems. We  have specially grasped experiments on reform of the Central  Philharmonic Orchestra, the Central Peking Opera Troupe, the  Central Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Oriental and Song and  Dance Ensemble. The leading group for the reform of artistic  performance organizations directly under the central authorities  set up last year has today put forward macro views on and key  operational points for the present stage of the structural  reform and they will be published after discussion and approval.    Here, the targeted mode of reform is to concentrate efforts  on properly running troupes which represent the national  artistic level, and, on the basis of making a scientific  assessment, improving the structure and personnel and pulling  together the strong points in terms of personnel, finance, and  materials to make general and rational readjustments of the  existing layout of institutions and troupes directly under the  central authorities.    To be specific, we shall establish a performance mechanism  with the help of the government and performance subsidies as the  center and this will effectively put an end to the "big pot" way  of distribution which makes no difference between those who work  and those who do not work and between those who work well and  those who do not. This will not be the same as what some people  said: Reform is simply to increase the income of personnel who  give performance; and without much money, people can eat from  "the same big pot," and with much money, people can still eat  from "the same big pot." The reform in the latter aspect is  even more difficult. At present, some artistic organizations  cannot continue to exist even if the planned economy structure  remained unchanged, and much less can they keep abreast of the  market economy structure. Regarding traditional, national,  refined literary and art organizations which represent the  national level, the state will focus its support on them through  increasing state input and social sponsorship to enhance their  improvement and development. In this respect, it is necessary  to establish, through this reform, a long- term, steady, and  reliable material guarantee channel and to thoroughly change the  situation in which such organizations are like beggars and can  give performance only when they have secured some money.    The concrete operation will also include the establishment  of  a personnel system which takes contract appointment as the  center and the ministry will help solve the problem of where to  go for various kinds of artistic personnel who are not employed,  who are waiting for employment, or who have been dismissed after  the sizes, posts, and personnel of institutions and troupes  directly under the central authorities have been fixed. We  shall adopt the method of dynamic separation centering round  artistic production. To be specific, various institutions and  troupes will organize the artistic creation and production of a  number of plays and programs this year and in the course of  making preparations for such plays and programs, it is necessary  to boldly adopt a new management structure, sign contracts with  those who are needed by the artistic production, put them in  positions by appointment, and carry out dynamic separation in  the course of artistic production. This shows that the  intensity of reform here is quite great. However, it will  totally get rid of the long-standing drawbacks of artistic  institutions and troupes directly under the central authorities,  be conducive to the establishment of a set of new and vigorous  operational mechanism, bring about artistic vitality, increase  the ability to compete in the market, set the institutions and  troupes as examples, and give impetus to the reform of artistic  performance organizations across the country.  <H3>  The Spiritual Loss of Cultural Workers and the Decline in  the Quality of Cultural Products Should Not be the Cost of Reform </H3>   Liu Zhongde also mentioned that following the increase in  intensity in the reform of cultural structure, the difficulty in  reform will also increase correspondingly. We should not expect  to accomplish the whole task at one stroke, but should advance  in an orderly manner, step by step, and with emphasis on some  points. We have just started the major task of establishing a  cultural structure which is in keeping with the socialist market  economy structure. Therefore, regarding the reform, we should  not hesitate, but should tackle problems with a sense of  undertaking a historical mission and properly carry out the  reform. Only in this way is there hope for cultural  undertaknigs. To accomplish this mission of the times, cultural  cadres at all levels and the broad masses of literary and art  workers should first of all have a good mental state and should  be able to correctly handle contradictions between the  individual and the collective, the individual and the  undertaking, and the present and the future which they meet with  in the course of reform. Without the mental state of forging  ahead despite difficulty, it will be difficult to persist in  reform.    Liu Zhongde pointed out that to test whether or not the  reform of the cultural structure is successful, it is necessary  to see whether or not the reform is conducive to three things,  that is, to fully arousing and giving play to the enthusiasm and  creativity of the broad masses of literary and art workers, to  producing products and talented people, bringing about  flourishing socialist cultural undertakings, and meeting the  people's growing needs in cultural life, and to promoting  economic development and comprehensive progress of the society.  Therefore, this reform should bring about new development and a  new situation in cultural undertakings instead of bring chaos to  cultural work. The spiritual loss of cultural workers and the  decline of the quality of cultural products should not be the  cost of reform. This does not conform with the law of  development of culture and art and we should pay attention to  this question. The central authorities have attached great  importance to, and shown great concern about, cultural work at  present, including the reform of the cultural structure,  exercised effective leadership, given effective guidance,  implemented clear-cut policies and principles, and won the  people's full support. Our work is precisely being carried out  under such concrete guidance.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Observers in Lusaka believe that the collapse of the  negotiations can be avoided. President of the Republic Jose  Eduardo dos Santos has sent an envoy to the Zambian capital,  possibly with new proposals for National Union for the Total  Independence of Angola demands. Carlos Feijo has already  returned to Luanda, after meeting with UN Special Representative  Alioune Blondin Beye and the government's negotiating team.</p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Observer: Muzzled If stockbrokers were forced to apologise and withdraw every report that proved to be rubbish, the City would be a much more sensible place. But as it rarely if ever happens, it is surprising that such a row has erupted over BZW's draft report on the implications of the Accounting Standards Board's proposals for company accounts. In terms of the quality of its investment research BZW ranks well down the league tables and it is not known for any particular expertise in reviewing new accounting standards. So why should there be such an uproar when it produces what sounds like a piece of shoddy research? Having to withdraw the draft is highly embarrassing for BZW. But it also shows how difficult it is for brokers to publish material which is not to companies' liking.</p>

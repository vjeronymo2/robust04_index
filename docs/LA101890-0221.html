THIS TIME AROUND, LANDLORDS HAVE SOME LEVERAGE.  </P> <P> After dominating Santa Monica politics for more than a decade, rent control has  been eclipsed by homelessness and development as an issue in the Nov. 6 city  election.  </P> <P> But let's understand something: This is still Santa Monica, which means if  there is a local election, then rent control is still a contentious subject.  The tough rent-control laws that earned the city the nickname "the People's  Republic of Santa Monica" are still in effect. And landlords still despise the  laws and are still trying to bring the system down.  </P> <P> Half of the 10 ballot measures before voters deal with rent control or housing  issues. Supporters of rent control contend that a sixth measure -- one that  would make the city attorney's office an elected position rather than one  appointed -- is also related to rent control because it is essentially an  attack on City Atty. Robert M. Myers, who authored the city's rent-control law.  </P> <P> In this election, the rent-control fight primarily revolves around two  competing ballot issues, one sponsored by landlords and the other by their  longtime adversaries, Santa Monicans for Renters' Rights, the tenant political  group commonly known by its acronym SMRR.  </P> <P> Tenants make up 70% of the city's population, and in past elections they have  given their overwhelming support to SMRR and its candidates.  </P> <P> This time, however, the landlords have some leverage they have previously  lacked, and their measure has been carefully crafted to appeal to the  self-interest of existing tenants.  </P> <P> Proposition U, placed on the ballot after landlords collected nearly 12,000  signatures on an initiative petition, would allow rents to increase to market  levels on units voluntarily vacated. The fact that apartments remain subject to  rent control even when voluntary vacancies occur is the primary reason that  Santa Monica's rent-control system is regarded as one of the nation's toughest.  </P> <P> Proposition W, which was placed on the ballot by the City Council at the urging  of SMRR, would allow rents on voluntarily vacated units to increase, but would  still keep the rents well below market levels.  </P> <P> The prevailing view among those involved in the city election campaigns is that  at least one of the two measures will probably pass, which means that new  tenants moving to Santa Monica will be paying higher rents. If both measures  are supported by a majority of voters, the one with the most affirmative votes  would prevail.  </P> <P> Although acknowledging that Proposition W was placed on the ballot to compete  with Proposition U, tenant advocates say it was also done in recognition that  after 11 years of rent control some changes were needed.  </P> <P> "What we are promoting is a new way of dealing with rent control that is a  little more cooperative in spirit," said Brad Jones, co-chairman of SMRR. "Rent  control has been in effect now for 11 years, but after 11 years everything  needs a certain amount of revision."  </P> <P> But landlords say that Proposition W offers them too little, too late, and that  the only way to maintain the city's rental housing stock is to give landlords  the significant rent increases that would be achieved under so-called vacancy  decontrol.  </P> <P> "Voluntary vacancy does not occur often enough to accept half an increase that  Prop. W provides," said Carl Lambert, an attorney and landlord. "Real increases  are needed to provide incentives for landlords to stay in business."  </P> <P> Proposition W would establish a system of "threshold rent" levels for vacated  apartments throughout the city, based on the number of bedrooms and what is  considered affordable to households whose income is 70% of the median for Los  Angeles County. For a one-bedroom apartment, the threshold rent would be $511,  for example, and for a two-bedroom it would be $613.  </P> <P> The citywide average for all rent-controlled apartments is now about $500,  according to rent-control officials. Although precise figures are not  available, it is generally believed that rents on the majority of  rent-controlled apartments in the city are below the threshold levels of  Proposition W.  </P> <P> If Proposition W passes, all apartments renting for less than the threshold  level would be allowed to rise to the threshold level when a vacancy occurs.  Apartments renting for more than the threshold level would be allowed 10%  increases when a vacancy occurs, but only if they complied with a set of  minimum maintenance standards.  </P> <P> If Proposition U passes, rents on voluntarily vacated apartments could be  expected to rise to the levels found nearby in West Los Angeles, where  one-bedroom apartments generally go for $800 to $1,000 and two-bedroom units  for $1,100 to $1,500.  </P> <P> The landlords' principal weapon in their fight against rent control in Santa  Monica is a 1986 state law called the Ellis Act, which allows landlords to  evict tenants and go out of business, as long as they give adequate notice and  pay relocation fees. Owners of more than 1,100 units have notified city  officials that they intend to take their apartments off the market.  </P> <P> Supporters of Proposition U say the landlord-sponsored measure is the only way  to stop landlords from removing their apartments from the market under the  Ellis Act.  </P> <P> "The apartment income gap has grown so huge, and the turnover rate is so small  that really significant reform is needed to encourage apartments owners to stay  in business," said James Baker, who owns four buildings with 75 units.  </P> <P> Landlords hope to draw a sizable number of tenant votes for Proposition U  because they now have both a carrot and a stick for tenants that they have  lacked in the past.  </P> <P> The carrot is that if Proposition U passes, rent controls will remain in effect  for existing tenants. Substantial rent increases will occur only when a unit is  voluntarily vacated. Thus, Proposition U backers are essentially encouraging  tenants to inflict big rent hikes on newcomers to preserve their own low rents.  </P> <P> The stick is that if Proposition U does not pass, more landlords will resort to  Ellis Act evictions.  </P> <P> SMRR leaders acknowledge that the landlords have new leverage this time, and  that the tenants group is less certain to prevail in this election.  </P> <P> Both SMRR and landlords had raised more than $160,000 each as of Sept. 30,  according to campaign financial statements filed with the city clerk. Landlords  spent about $73,000 qualifying the initiative, whereas SMRR has spent most of  its money on literature promoting its candidates and positions on the different  ballot measures.  </P> <P> Landlords charge that SMRR, whose candidates control the majority on the City  Council and the rent board, is only interested in saving its political future.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem that SMRR has is accepting the fact that maybe (vacancy  decontrol) would work," said Bob Gabriel, a former City Council member who is  listed on the ballot argument in favor of Proposition U. "Without rent control,  SMRR's base of power would disappear."  </P> <P> But rent-control advocates say that SMRR's opposition to vacancy decontrol is a  continuation of its commitment to preserving affordable housing in Santa  Monica.  </P> <P> "We think vacancy decontrol is a disastrous housing policy," Jones said. "The  free market does not apply to a good like housing. Government needs to have a  policy that is going to maintain housing affordability."  </P> <P> Supporters of Proposition W also argue that Proposition U would give landlords  enough of a financial incentive to harass tenants into voluntarily giving up  their apartments.  </P> <P> "Tenants are wrong if they think a landlord won't try it," said Lisa Monk  Borrino, a tenant attorney who is running for a seat on the Rent Control Board.  "Landlords are going to want them out at all costs."  </P> <P> Landlords counter that existing anti-harassment provisions sufficiently protect  tenants.  </P> <P> Jones acknowledged that landlords may not have always gotten a fair shake from  the rent board, but said SMRR's current slate of four candidates for the board  represents a new spirit of cooperation.  </P> <P> "This group is strong on defending tenants' rights, but they have a new  approach of attempting to work with people rather than beating them over the  head," Jones said.  </P> <P> The other measures on the ballot related to rent control and housing are:  </P> <P> * Proposition R, which would require that 30% of all new construction of  multifamily housing each year be set aside for low- and moderate-income people.  </P> <P> * Proposition V, which would amend the city's condominium conversion law to  ensure that all conversions abide by the city's Tenant Ownership Rights Charter  Amendment process.  </P> <P> * Proposition X, which would exempt state-owned property from the city's  rent-control laws.  </P> <P> SMRR supports Proposition R as a way to preserve a diverse community by  ensuring that new housing will include affordable units for people of all  incomes. Opponents argue, however, that the provision will discourage  development because construction costs will increase and fees normally paid by  developers for the construction of affordable housing by the city will dry up.  </P> <P> Proposition X is a narrowly written measure intended to resolve a dispute over  whether cabanas and other living quarters on the site of the Sand and Sea Club  fall under rent control. The club, on a parcel of state-owned beach, closed  last month, but the individual cabanas remain open for their tenants.  </P> <P> SMRR has not taken a formal position on Proposition X, but all four of its  candidates for the rent control board oppose the measure because they say if  rental units remain on the property they should fall under rent control.  </P> <P> There is little or no opposition to Proposition V.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HOUSING MEASURES ON BALLOT  </P> <P> Among the 10 ballot measures that will go before Santa Monica voters Nov. 6 are  these five dealing with housing issues. They are listed in order of appearance  on the ballot.  </P> <P> Proposition R (affordable housing) -- Would require that 30% of all new  residential multifamily units be set aside for low- and moderate-income  residents.  </P> <P> Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the request of Santa  Monicans for Renters' Rights, the city's big tenant organization. It represents  an attempt to maintain affordable housing, particularly in the face of the  growing number of rental units being lost as landlords go out of business.  </P> <P> City Council candidates in favor -- Tony Vazquez, Kelly Olsen, Sharon L.  Gilpin, Kathleen Schwallie.  </P> <P> Against -- Jean Gebman, Christine E. Reed, Donna Alvarez.  </P> <P> No position -- Robert T. Holbrook, Larry Jon Hobbs.  </P> <P> Proposition U (vacancy decontrol) -- Would allow rents on apartment units  vacated voluntarily to rise to market rates.  </P> <P> Background -- Placed on the ballot through initiative drive sponsored by  landlords. Rent controls that remain in effect even when a unit is voluntarily  vacated are what make Santa Monica's rent law one of the nation's toughest.  Landlords say passage of this measure is the only way to make it worthwhile to  stay in business.  </P> <P> Candidates in favor -- Holbrook, Hobbs, Alvarez, Reed, Gebman.  </P> <P> Against -- Vazquez, Olsen, Schwallie, Gilpin.  </P> <P> Proposition V (condo conversions) -- Would amend the city's condominium  conversion law.  </P> <P> Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council as a way to ensure that  all condominium conversions abide by the city's Tenant Ownership Rights Charter  Amendment process. The city planning staff has been allowing owners who live in  the property being considered for conversion to participate in the tenants'  conversion vote. But the city attorney has issued a ruling that such landlords  will no longer be allowed to vote unless this measure passes.  </P> <P> Candidates in favor: Holbrook, Vazquez, Olsen, Reed, Gebman, Gilpin, Schwallie.  </P> <P> No position -- Hobbs, Alvarez.  </P> <P> Proposition W (rent control) -- Would allow rents on units vacated voluntarily  to be increased to specific higher levels based on number of bedrooms. Would  also establish a set of minimum maintenance standards that landlords would have  to meet to be eligible to collect the increased rents.  </P> <P> Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the urging of Santa  Monicans for Renters' Rights to compete with the landlord-sponsored Proposition  U. Rents would be allowed to increase, but would remain significantly below  free-market levels.  </P> <P> Candidates in favor -- Vazquez, Olsen.  </P> <P> Against -- Holbrook, Reed, Alvarez, Hobbs, Schwallie, Gebman.  </P> <P> No position -- Gilpin.  </P> <P> Proposition X (rent control exemption) -- Would exempt state-owned property  from the city's rent-control law.  </P> <P> Background -- Placed on the ballot by the City Council at the request of  Councilwoman Reed. Designed to settle a question over whether cabanas and other  living quarters on the site of the Sand and Sea Club fall under rent control.  The club has been evicted from the site, so the measure is essentially moot  unless the matter goes to court.  </P> <P> Candidates in favor -- Alvarez, Holbrook, Hobbs, Vazquez, Olsen, Reed, Gebman.  </P> <P> Against -- Schwallie, Gilpin.  </P></p>

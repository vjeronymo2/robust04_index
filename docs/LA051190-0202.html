			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> DOLEMAN NOW TOP-PAID VIKING  </P> <P> Chris Doleman has signed a contract that makes him the best-paid player in  Minnesota Vikings' history and one of the NFL's best-paid defensive linemen,  according to agents with knowledge of the agreement.  </P> <P> The agents said Doleman's one-year contract is worth about $1.4 million, the  Star Tribune reported today.  </P> <P> The deal might be worth as much as $1.6 million including incentive clauses,  the agents said. The agreement also includes money from an out-of-court  settlement, the agents said.  </P> <P> Doleman, an All-Pro defensive end, made $300,000 in base salary last season.  </P> <P> If the estimates are correct, Doleman's contract would eclipse those of the  highest-paid Vikings, quarterback Wade Wilson and running back Herschel Walker,  both of whom will make more than $1 million for the 1990 season.  </P></p>

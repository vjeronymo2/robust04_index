			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Letter: Community finance would give fillip to Merseyside infrastructure and training Sir, It makes for easy copy to categorise Merseyside with Corsica ('Merseyside covets neighbour's lifestyle', February 26), because of the possibility of the area's receiving Objective One status from the European Community, but it does not explain the benefits we may see as a consequence. Per capita income in Merseyside is 79.8 per cent of the EC average; Corsica's equivalent figure is nearer 40 per cent. Merseyside's problems are the social consequence of a sophisticated regional economy that has no need to employ people in the numbers it once did. Merseyside's main traditional employers - docks and cars - are performing well. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company, Ford and Vauxhall are successful businesses employing high technology instead of people. Objective One finance, in the absence of regional policy from Westminster, provides public funds to stimulate new infrastructure works and training to try to cope with the displacement of people by capital plant. An expanded Liverpool Airport would help enormously. Do we envy Manchester? We envy its clever politicians, whose plans for Manchester Airport and the Olympics bid have attracted massive public subsidy without provoking press fury. And we envy the fact that, as the centre of the north-west's media industry, journalists based there prefer to castigate Liverpool rather than incur the wrath of friends in Manchester. The Liverpool business community wishes Manchester Godspeed, but envies the blind eye its problems enjoy in the media.

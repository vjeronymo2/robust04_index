			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Survey of Seville and World Expo '92 (4): Slow, haughty, indifferent - The People of Seville WHEN the bullfighter Rafael Gomez 'El Gallo' returned from an exhausting tour of South America to the Northwestern port of La Coruna he was reputedly impatient to get home to Seville. 'Seville is a long way away, Rafael,' his friends told him. 'Seville is where it ought to be,' said the matador. 'What's far away is this place.' That was in the pre-World War One days of long transatlantic crossings and slow steam engines. Seville now has a huge airport and a high speed train but the attitude of its native sons has not visibly changed: the city remains the centre of their universe and they are not particularly curious about what lies beyond it. Such thinking means that Universal Expositions don't count for all that much in Seville. At best Expo '92 is a welcome, but in no way imperative, addition to the city. At worst it is an imposition. Seville, the most class-ridden and laidback big city in Spain, has evolved a rhythm of its own. Its Holy Week religious processions, which will take place the week before Expo opens, and its annual Feria, which starts its blitzkrieg of fino drinking, flamenco dancing and corrida rituals a week after the Exposition's inauguration, are far more important events. The city is fussy about form although it is often short on content. Modernity and innovation arouse suspicions and all hype that is not associated with the madonnas at Holy Week or with an idolised matador during the Feria bullfights is considered bad form. Disneyland happenings are distinctly ersatz for a society that takes pride in what it describes as its 'baroque' world view and that believes utterly in duende, a word that literally means ghost and which suggests rarefied behaviour. Sevillians are turned on by a high stepping horse, by the grace with which a gypsy dancer moves her arms and by the stylishness that a young blood employs at Feria time to tilt his broad brimmed hat over his right eyebrow. The sheer size and scope of Expo doesn't impress the locals. They know all about that because, amongst other things, their cathedral, which was built nearly a century before Columbus's landfall in the New World, is quite vast. 'Let us build a church so enormous that everyone who looks at it will take us for madmen,' announced the Cathedral's chapter as they laid down its first stone. Sevillians relish telling that story. The present day city mayor, Alejandro Rojas Marcos, has provided a lead in the local refusal to be overawed by the great event. He complains that Expo has been built 'without taking Seville into account' and, up to the last moment, he has been a headache to its organisers. Recently he demanded that Pta2bn should be paid from the state budget into Seville's municipal coffers as compensation for the disruption caused to the city's life by the Exposition. He even threatened to refuse municipal building licences to Expo pavilions that had already been built, thus in theory preventing the public from entering them, unless his demand was met. The mayor is the leader of the Andalucian regional party and, as a long time opponent of Felipe Gonzalez, the socialist premier and fellow Sevillian, he can be counted upon to seize every opportunity to embarrass the ruling party. But his decidedly lukewarm attitude towards Expo is widely shared locally. The overwhelming number of those who have made Expo happen, including its commissioner-general Emilio Cassinello and its chief executive Jacinto Pellon, are non-Sevillians. Middle ranking officials, drafted in from Madrid, Bilbao and elsewhere over the past four years to put the show on the road, often reciprocate with their ambivalent views about Seville society. Some officials talk about a closed off Seville society that views outsiders with near hostility. And they confess to extreme frustrations over local traders and business people who appeared incapable of producing sensible budgets and of delivering on time. One of the Spainish pavilions decided early on to have its brochures printed in Madrid and another preferred to fly in electricians for a day's work. None of this means that Sevillians won't have the time of their lives for the next six months thanks to the fact that Expo has landed on their doorstep. Tens of thousands poured into the exhibition zone when it held its open days during the construction phase and they filled it with the infectious sense of joy that they call alegria. They have snapped up the season ticket passes and they will certainly turn the Exposition into the biggest fiesta ever staged. To satisfy Seville's irrepressible joie de vivre, the organisers have broken new ground with what is called Expo Noche, an after hours and cut price schedule of concerts, open air film shows and other attractions that will last until 4 am. It will undoubtably set new standards for all night partying. But whether Seville will use the Expo windfall to vault into the 21st century is quite another matter. Expo will be fun but it is a wholly serious enterprise in as far as it has been the catalyst for one of the most ambitious regional development efforts ever undertaken by a European government. Seville has received the finest communications infrastructure that money can buy. It could be that Sevillians, with so much of Expo's 'Ages of Discoveries' drummed into their minds for 176 days, will discover that they have it in themselves to break out of their ancestral pleasure-seeking lethargy. But they might echo 'El Gallo' and, deciding that Expo, once over, was something far away, return to a Seville that will forever remain where it ought to be.</p>

In his speech, Mayor Huang Ju  emphatically noted: We should regard the work of maintaining  sustained economic development and social stability as an  important matter and create a favorable environment for  deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and  promoting development. We should conscientiously do a good job  in various aspects of work to make sure that Shanghai's economy  will continue a good momentum for development this year.    Huang Ju analyzed the current situation at the meeting and  said: This is a crucial year for us to implement the guidelines  in the "decision" adopted at the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and to advance the reform by  establishing a socialist market economic system. This is also a  decisive year for all Shanghai citizens to bring about "a change  every year and a significant change in three years." Taking a  look at the situation in January, we have had a good beginning:  The economy continued to maintain the momentum for sustained,  rapid, and healthy development and all important measures for  reform, opening up, development, and the stability arranged at  the beginning of this year proceeded smoothly. The work on  distribution in rural areas is being carried on in full swing,  and the prevention of epidemics is firmly under control. All  kinds of preparatory work for market supplies during the Spring  Festival are basically in place, and a revenue-sharing system  between the municipality and districts and counties has been  preliminarily determined. Other tasks are also proceeding  properly.    Speaking on the work for February, Huang Ju stressed: Under  the favorable conditions, we must remain sober-minded, pay  special attention to the national macroeconomic trend, and  attach importance to and overcome difficulties. Proceeding from  the realities in Shanghai, we should work earnestly to properly  resolve difficulties and problems in the operations of the  economy. Then Huang Ju put forward measures for tackling  problems in opening up markets, enterprises' capital and  economic returns, foreign investment and trade, and other  fields. In the meantime, Huang Ju proposed that it was  necessary to adhere to the unified arrangement of the state in  comprehensively and earnestly implementing the important reform  in financing, taxation, banking, foreign trade, and investment  which has been determined by the central authorities. The work  of instituting the revenue-sharing system between the  municipality and districts and counties should be continued  thoroughly and meticulously. The work within districts and  counties should also be stressed properly, and all departments  and units must take the overall situation into account and help  one another like people crossing a river in the same boat, so as  to constantly improve this reform, inspire the enthusiasm of  both the municipality as well as districts and counties, and  really put this system into practice with satisfactory results.  Huang Ju stressed: Under the condition in which greater action  will be taken to promote the reform of the economic system this  year, we must do a good job in linking up the old system with  the new one, and ensure a timely and smooth transition toward  the new system, so that there is no fracture and disorder in the  transition. We should minimize the influence of the replacement  of the old system with the new one on the operations of economy  to ensure sustained, rapid, and stable economic development [chi  xu kuai su wen ding fa zhan 2170 4958 1816 6643 4489 1353 4099  1455] in Shanghai in the first quarter of this year.    Huang Ju said: Shanghai is enjoying social stability, and  the basic conditions are good currently, but some new  contradictions and problems also exist. Governments at various  levels must make greater efforts to handle well the relations  between reform, development, and stability. They should treat  social stability as an important matter, proceed in their work  meticulously and conscientiously, create a favorable environment  for deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, and  promoting development; and make sure that the great number of  Shanghai citizens will enjoy a happy traditional holiday in the  atmosphere of stability and peace. To this end, we must first  step up the rectification and management of social order to  maintain public security and stability. While continuing our  efforts to strictly crack down on crimes, we should strengthen  the comprehensive management of social security and earnestly  remain on our guard before and after the festival. Leaders at  various levels should persist in going right to the forefront to  organize the implementation of security measures for safe  production, construction, and transportation; ensuring heat  supplies; and forestalling fires, explosions, and poisonings; as  well as continue to improve the emergency measures against thick  fog, blizzards, and frost during the holidays. They should  seriously organize the two-week campaign of straightening out  the municipality's traffic, appearance, and environment to greet  the Spring Festival. Departments in charge of municipal affairs  and traffic management should spare no effort in bringing  traffic under strict control; all districts and counties should  firmly sweep away those taking up streets and setting up stalls  at random and other violations of rules; and all major streets,  residential areas, and commercial outlets should conscientiously  carry out the measures of maintaining and ensuring a clean  Shanghai. Second, we should make meticulous arrangements to  ensure market supplies during the holidays and step up the  construction of the "vegetable basket" project, particularly the  construction of the "green vegetable project." Under the  current conditions of a better shopping environment and more  abundant supplies of commodities on the market, we should  particularly pay attention to the demand of various levels,  facilitate the masses' consumption during the holidays, and  enhance the supervision of commodity prices and the management  of food hygiene. Third, we should persist in properly carrying  out the campaign of showing concern for the poor by seriously  implementing the measures of resolving their problems and  helping them and doing some helpful deeds for them in a  down-to-earth manner. Governments and leading cadres at all  levels must assume the responsibilities of leadership to ensure  safety.    In conclusion, Huang Ju said: This is a crucial point for  deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting  development, and maintaining the current stability. We must  seize the opportunity, concentrate our efforts on these tasks,  make serious arrangements, quietly immerse ourselves in hard  work, and never relax in striving for a good beginning in all  aspects of work and for further progress in the work within this  year.    Vice Mayor Meng Jianzhu relayed to the meeting the  guidelines  of the national conference on the "vegetable basket" and grain,  cotton, and oil project.    Also attending the meeting were Vice Mayors Zhao Qizheng,  Xie  Lijuan, Xia Keqiang, Sha Lin, and Gong Xueping, and persons in  charge of various commissions, offices, and bureaus under the  municipal government, as well as district and county governments.</p>

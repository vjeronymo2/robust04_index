			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Energy Efficiency (5): A spanner in the natural gas works - United Kingdom THE major review of energy policy which was recently announced by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, could throw a spanner into the energy efficiency works. Prompted as it was by the public outcry over closure of the coal pits, its unspoken purpose will be to find ways of sustaining demand for power, and particularly coal-fired power. To people interested in energy efficiency, this can only mean one thing: less efficiency. Although a review of environmental and energy efficiency targets is not officially on the agenda, ministers admit privately that these may well suffer from the pressure to burn more coal. Among the options before the government are to postpone deregulation of the electricity market in order to delay the switch from coal to natural gas, or to scrap part of the UK nuclear programme to make room for more coal-fired stations. Both these options would increase the UK's carbon emissions. Mr Heseltine has promised a White Paper early in the new year, and says he will propose changes to the law if necessary. The irony is that this is happening only five months after Mr John Major, the prime minister, subscribed to pledges at the Rio Earth Summit to try and reduce emissions of harmful greenhouse gases. Those pledges were going to be difficult enough to achieve at the best of times. Like other EC countries, the UK has promised to bring output of carbon dioxide back to its 1990 level by the year 2000. The level registered in 1990 was 160m tonnes. The government recently scaled down its forecast for the year 2000 (in light of lower-than-expected economic growth, principally). But at 166m-201m tonnes it remains disturbingly high. Government officials maintain that there is scope to bring that down by a further 20m tonnes, but it would require a major effort on the conservation front, since the UK is among the larger emitters of greenhouse gases in Europe. The UK's overall position on energy efficiency is average for an industrial country. According to the Energy Efficiency Office, which is part of the Department of the Environment, it is comparable to France, slightly better than West Germany and slightly worse than Japan in terms of energy consumer per unit of GDP. It does a lot better than the US. Its carbon dioxide emissions are about 2.7 per cent of the world total, and amount to 2.8 tonnes per capita, close to the European average. Thanks to a string of energy efficiency and environmental measures, progress has been made on a number of fronts. Industrial, power station and domestic emissions have been stable or declining for the past two decades. One of the more promising developments is the growth of combined heat and power (CHP) schemes to produce usable heat as well as electricity. These can be applied to hospitals, large hostels and industrial sites. The environment department estimates that there are currently CHP schemes at 600 sites in the UK accounting for three per cent of electricity generated. But emissions continue to rise in the transport sector, posing the toughest problems for conservation policy. Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, has proposed road pricing or higher vehicle taxes to bring the growth in check, but the verdict must await a special study being carried out by the department of transport, and due for completion next year. The number of cars on the road - which account for 80 per cent of road vehicles - has risen from about 2.5m in 1951 to about 20m in 1990. The Department of Transport projects that the volumes of most kinds of traffic will nearly double over the next 30 years. Although Mr Howard has also expressed interest in the EC's carbon tax proposal, his support for it has been guarded. The official UK position is that the proposal should be studied, but with an eye on the downside as well as the up. But the government's record on energy efficiency has come under attack from environmental and trade lobby groups for its failure to address what they claim are major structural problems. The Association for the Conservation of Energy, which represents the energy efficiency industry, points out that while economic growth fell in 1991, consumption of energy rose, meaning that the UK actually became less rather than more energy efficient last year. It blames 'an overwhelming bias' towards supply rather than efficiency investments. This includes the tax and regulatory system, and the absence of proper incentives for people and businesses to overcome the barriers to investing in energy saving. The new Energy Saving Trust set up by the government will help British Gas and the regional electricity companies identify projects to help their domestic customers use energy more efficiently. It intends the costs of the investments to be passed through to electricity and gas consumers in their bills. However, environmental groups have argued that the Trust's impact on the UK's standards of energy efficiency is likely to be small. The furore over the coal closures has shown that the UK's good fortune in being the most fuel-rich nation in Europe can also be a curse. Entire sectors of the economy and many jobs depend on demand for fuel, and this adds to the bias against conservation.</p>

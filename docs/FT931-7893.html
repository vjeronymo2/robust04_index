			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings of ADollars 36m for Fairfax at halfway JOHN Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, has announced interim net profits of ADollars 36m (USDollars 24.4m) for the six months to end-December. Fairfax, which was floated on the Australian Stock Exchange in May, said the figures were not comparable with the first half of the previous year, when the group was in receivership. However, the group earned net profits of ADollars 27m in the six months to June, after offsetting an income-tax liability of ADollars 11.5m against tax credits carried over from the receivership. Sales were ADollars 388.5m compared with ADollars 357.4m in the second half of last year. Fairfax said it benefited from higher advertising revenue and lower net interest costs, reflecting Australia's falling interest rates and gradual recovery from recession. Sales of the Sydney Morning Herald and The (Melbourne) Age increased, but the group said the difficult business environment was responsible for a 3 per cent fall in the circulation of the Australian Financial Review. The board said it had decided in principle to build a ADollars 300m printing plant in Sydney, which is intended to match the improved printing facilities installed by News Corporation, Australia's biggest publishing group. The group said the plant would be operational by 1996, allowing improved presentation of its newspapers and reducing production costs. 'These factors are expected to have a significant positive impact on the long term competitive strength of the company,' the board said. The directors said there would be no dividend, in line with forecasts in the flotation prospectus. The Daily Telegraph owns 15 per cent of Fairfax, but has applied to the federal government for permission to lift its stake to 20 per cent.</p>

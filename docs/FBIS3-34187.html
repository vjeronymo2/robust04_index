Hojjat ol-eslam val-moslemin Seyyed Ahmad Khomeyni spoke at  the meeting, which was held to praise the martyrs of the Islamic  revolution, and also for thanksgiving prayers for the passing of  the assassination danger against our country's president. Those  attending also thanked the commanders and personnel of the Army  for their services in guarding the boundaries of the Islamic  motherland and the school of Koran.    Referring to the assassination attempt against the  president,  Khomeyni said: The Islamic revolution does not depend on an  individual, and assassination or terror among the people will  fail to deviate the revolution from its principle path.</p>

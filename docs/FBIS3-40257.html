			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Kalman Lorincz, retiring </F> commander of the Hungarian Army, by Zoltan Fekete; place and  date not given: "I Am Leaving an Unhappy Army"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Fekete] Do you accept the  opinion, according to which most of the officers of the  Hungarian Army are leftist oriented?    [Lorincz] I know the officers and generals of the Hungarian  Army professionally, and not from a political viewpoint.  Therefore, I can responsibly state that most of the Hungarian  soldiers are worth appreciating for both their professional  activity and moral stand. Obviously, we had dirty affairs that  cast a shadow on this image, but I think one should not evaluate  the entire army and its officers and generals on the basis of  these affairs. Our soldiers are disciplined and are carrying  out their tasks in accordance with their oath. I do not recall  a single case of failing to carry out my orders, although  similar cases often took place in our region. Our staff of  officers are not mediocre and, despite their faults and  problems, they are worth much more than society thinks.  [passage omitted]    [Fekete] Mr. Lorincz! How would you describe the army that  you are going to hand over to your successor on 1 March?    [Lorincz] The army has preserved its combat readiness even  if it has become unhappy. The most important thing is that we  succeeded in stabilizing it, because the army is a very  sensitive organization that can only function under calm  circumstances. If there is no stability and everything  disintegrates simultaneously, unpredicted changes can emerge,  and this leads to new tensions.    I think we did not succeed in concluding anything, but we  started something.    From an offensive army belonging to the Warsaw Pact, we  began  building a national army capable of carrying out defense tasks.  This is a very complex process that needs 10-15 years to  complete. We had to carry out radical changes at a much faster  pace than normal. In addition, we had to do all this in harmony  with the social changes. We had to meet the challenges of the  prevailing international situation, and I do not only mean here  the war in Yugoslavia, but also the reevaluation and  restructuring of our entire system of military contacts. I know  that we received a lot of criticism for not having this process  concluded to this very day. I think our economic conditions give  a perfect answer to this: Our budget is constantly decreasing  and we are constantly using up our reserves, while our military  equipment has become obsolete and the living standard of our  professional staff continues to deteriorate.    [Fekete] What do you regard as the biggest shortcoming of  your activity of more than four years?    [Lorincz] I could not do enough for our professional staff,  commensurate with what their activity, moral stand, and honesty  deserve. I am leaving a dispirited army. Not because the army  does not agree with the changes, but because it has less  opportunity to creatively assist these changes. I am convinced  that, now when we are laying the pillars of the post-1995  Hungarian Army, we should pay much more attention to the living  problems of our professional staff.    [Fekete] What are the pillars you are talking about?    [Lorincz] We have already begun the process of developing  the armed forces and creating the legal regulations of a new  democratic army, because the Parliament adopted the security  policy and defense principles, and a new defense bill has also  been legislated. The bill on the soldiers' legal status is  already on the government's table, a bill that, hopefully, would  guarantee the long-term living conditions of our professional  staff. We also started working out the personnel bases of the  future army, including the new leadership and organizational  principles. Last, but not least, an improvement in our military  technology and weapons is currently under way. If I succeeded  in contributing to all these processes, I can say that I am  satisfied.    [Fekete] What is your opinion about the chances of the  Hungarian Army to integrate into NATO? What new burdens would  this mean for Hungary and for the Hungarian Army?    [Lorincz] The greatest advantage of the Partnership for  Peace program is that it represents a realistic burden for the  countries wishing to participate in it. We do not want to  participate in a quantitative race; we would like to offer our  quality to our partners. This could represent more both in time  and funds than what we think today.

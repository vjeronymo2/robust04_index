			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Nigeria pro-welfare party poised for election victory NIGERIA'S Social Democratic party, one of two army-imposed political parties, was poised last night to take control of both chambers of a new National Assembly after the country's first parliamentary elections in nearly a decade of military rule. The elections, marred by incidents of fighting at polling booths on Saturday, mark the penultimate step in the return of black Africa's most populous country to civilian rule next January. Final parliamentary election results will indicate which party is likely to win the critical presidential elections in December. While there are few policy differences between the army-written manifestos of the two political parties, the victory of the pro-welfare SDP over its conservative opponent, the National Republican Convention, is likely to encourage criticism of and opposition to the government's economic austerity programme. With almost 90 per cent of the ballot counted for the 593-member House of Representatives, Nigerian state radio said the SDP had won 287 seats to the NRC's 221, and was leading in the race for the 91-seat Senate by 43 to 323. Results suggested a low turnout of about 25 per cent with both parties drawing support from their tribal and regional political strongholds. Party election officials said the low turnout was a result of voters' distaste for the open ballot system in which people had to queue for several hours in the morning heat behind a poster of their chosen candidate. Pro-democracy activists in Lagos said the poor turnout was also a sign of how alienated most Nigerians feel by an artificial and undemocratic political system which has been dictated by the military regime of Gen Ibrahim Babangida. Results from the 30 states of the federation showed the SDP had won a landslide victory in Lagos, Nigeria's huge commercial capital, and in the Yoruba speaking states of the southwest like Ogun, Ondo and Oyo. The SDP was also making a strong showing in so called multi-ethnic 'middle belt' states such as Plateau and Kwara. The NRC was sweeping the traditionally conservative and Moslem Hausa-Fulani states in the north and was marginally ahead in the predominantly Igbo-speaking east and south-east.</p>

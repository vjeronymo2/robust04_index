			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Canada's unity talks resuming CANADIAN federal and provincial officials will spend the next week seeking to break an impasse in protracted national unity talks aimed at forestalling the separatist movement in Quebec, writes Bernard Simon in Toronto. Talks broke off at the weekend with deep rifts among the nine English-speaking provinces. Failure to break the deadlock soon may leave Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister, with little choice but to call a national referendum. Ottawa is keen to present a package of reforms before October when Quebec is scheduled to hold a referendum.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A LABOR OF LOVE FROM PARISHIONERS;  </P> <P> 'WHAT'S COOKING AT MOUNT TABOR': DISHING UP A TASTE OF NOSTALGIA  </P> <P> My friend, Lee Witte, invited me to our annual get-together lunch at the Bistro  Garden and then presented me with a copy of the Mount Tabor Freewill Baptist  Church, Creswell, N.C., cookbook.  </P> <P> The church on the cover looked starkly old American; brick and clapboard with a  hardware store screen door that I could almost hear creaking as it opened and  closed. I could see the Welcome on the service schedule board and felt it.  </P> <P> "The cooks in that book are all my relatives, starting with Aunt Clara who  raised me," said Witte, whose Southern accent has a decided English tilt,  typical, she says, of the 15th-Century coastal North Carolina settlement where  she grew up. Her ancestors, she says, have been living in parts around Creswell  since.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Long Way We've Come  </P> <P> We ordered the chopped chef's salad and the waiter passed the crisp rolls.  "Some iced tea?" he asked. "No, iced coffee," I said, and picked up a Cristofle  fork to dig into the salad.  </P> <P> As I flipped through the pages of "What's Cooking at Mount Tabor," I found  myself thinking about the long way we've come since the days when picnic  macaroni made with canned luncheon meat and sweet pickles or "bar-b-que" sauce  for pork or venison sounded good.  </P> <P> Or when meat balls stroganoff made with catsup and canned mushroom soup were  considered company fare. And when squash casserole made with cream of chicken  soup and stuffing mix could send you to culinary heaven and back.  </P> <P> Well, to tell the truth, I felt more than a twinge of nostalgia for those days,  those tastes, sitting at the Bistro thousands of light years from the smell of  squash casserole, sweet potato pudding, mayonnaise rolls or do-nothing cake, a  dessert in which all the ingredients are mixed together and baked.  </P> <P> A beautiful platter of salmon with sorrel sauce floated by our table and was  served with a flourish to a woman who looked like Princess Di.  </P> <P> I went back to pork-chop casserole on page 9 of the Mount Tabor book, which  struck me as especially tempting. All you do is brown the chops, add a layer of  sliced onions and layer of sliced potatoes and top it all off with a can of  mushroom soup diluted with water. Then you bake it for an hour.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Delightful Casserole  </P> <P> I could picture the casserole at a church supper brought in by Aunt Clara. A  lot of love goes in those casseroles, I'll bet. And I'll take a bite any time.  </P> <P> "Some low-calorie dessert today, ladies?" asked Ralph, our waiter with a wink.  </P> <P> "Oh, come on, Ralphy," Witte said coyly. "You want me to spoil my girlish  figure?" Then her voice went down a naughty decibel and she moved the Emmanuel  Kahn bifocals on her pert nose down a centimeter or two. "What have you got?"  she asked.  </P> <P> Ralph rattled off the dessert menu: raspberry torte, apple tarte tatin,  chocolate mousse and chocolate walnut cake, cheesecake and lemon meringue  torte.  </P> <P> It just happened that my eyes were locked on the peach cobbler recipe on page  68 in the cookbook's dessert chapter.  </P> <P> "You have peach cobbler, by chance?" I asked, knowing he didn't.  </P> <P> "No, Madame, I'm afraid we don't," Ralph said, "but we do have iced fresh  peaches, if that is satisfactory."  </P> <P> Frankly, iced fresh peaches sounded very satisfactory, but I wasn't up to them.  I suddenly had a hankering for hot peach cobbler, with the warm sauce melting  the homemade vanilla ice cream over the peaches.  </P> <P> Ah, well.  </P> <P> "OK, honey," Witte said to me. "Go back to work and I'll get hubby to come pick  me up," she ordered. She gave me a hug, drawing me like a Raggedy Anne doll  into her buxom frame in a way that meant love.  </P> <P> Like the Welcome on the Mount Tabor Freewill Baptist Church service schedule  board means love.  </P> <P> Like the pork-chop casserole and the hot peach cobbler in "What's Cooking at  Mount Tabor."  </P> <P>  Note: A copy of "What's Cooking at Mount Tabor" can be obtained by sending $5,  plus $1.25 for handling, to Mount Tabor Freewill Baptist Church, Attention  Ladies Auxiliary, Route 2, Box 177-A, Creswell, N.C. 27928.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PORK CHOP CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 5 pork chops  </P> <P> 3 medium onions, sliced  </P> <P> 5 medium potatoes  </P> <P> 1 can mushroom soup  </P> <P> Brown pork chops.

Pour over casserole.  Cover with foil and bake at 350 degrees 1 hour. Makes 5 servings.  </P> <P> </P> <P> AUNT CLARA'S SQUASH CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 2 cups grated squash  </P> <P> 2 eggs, beaten  </P> <P> 1 medium onion, minced  </P> <P> 1/2 cup grated American cheese  </P> <P> 1/2 cup butter, melted  </P> <P> 1/2 cup crushed saltine crackers  </P> <P> 1/4 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> Mix squash, eggs, onion, cheese, butter, crackers and salt. Mix well and pour  into greased baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees 45 minutes.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Salih Qallab in Amman and AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT </F> bureau in Cairo: "Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese Consultations To  Counter Israel's `Middle East Market' Proposal"]    [Excerpt] Highly placed diplomatic sources have revealed  that Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon have reached an advanced stage  in consultations -- with the participation of King Husayn of  Jordan and Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad -- aimed at  crystallizing a strong economic bloc in the region capable of  standing fast in the face of Israel in the future after the  creation of the so-called "Middle East market."    According to the same sources, the Syrian-Jordanian-Lebanese  consultations and meetings in this connection have made great  progress and the technical experts from the three countries have  completed the major part of the draft concepts and required  studies and all that remains is the political decision which  awaits the right circumstances in the region and at Arab and  international levels.    It seems that the United States and Russia are aware of  these  moves and that the issue was discussed by Presidents Clinton and  al-Asad during their latest meeting in Geneva some months ago.  The issue was also discussed with Syrian, Jordanian, and  Lebanese officials by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  and Viktor Kosovalyuk, head of the Middle East and North Africa  Section at the Russian Foreign Ministry, on their successive  visits to the region.    Some circles believe that this development, which had not  previously been disclosed or publicized, might have something to  do with the Syrian position passed to U.S. and Russian  officials, that if Syria is to participate in the peace process  in the region, it must play a regional part in the Middle East.    The question being asked is whether the PLO and the National  Authority in Gaza and Jericho, and later in the West Bank, would  be given any part in that process. Some say that the  Palestinian part would come at a later stage when the situation  stabilizes and becomes clearer, but others claim that Syria has  imposed a veto against the PLO on the grounds that the latter  accepted a separate solution and concluded agreements considered  by Syria to be in the interest of Israel's future economic  designs.    The same sources say that the Iraqis were perhaps informed  by  Jordan or Syria indirectly about the formation of such a bloc.  The sources add, however, that Iraq, in its current situation,  can only listen to such ideas but even in the long run it would  have priorities other than such a bloc, especially rebuilding  what was destroyed by the war and years of boycott.    The Egyptians most probably know about the aforementioned  economic bloc but they do not favor such a step or talking about  at this sensitive stage, particularly as that might affect the  current peace process.    Some circles believe that Syria, in agreement with Jordan  and  Lebanon, perhaps deliberately brandished the bloc card to put  pressure on Israel and the United States for more concessions on  the question of withdrawal from the occupied Golan Heights.

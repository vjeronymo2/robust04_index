			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> ANTI-SMOG ORDERS MAY DOUBLE FIRMS WITH 4-DAY WORKWEEKS;  </P> <P> POLLUTION: COUNTY BUSINESSES HAVING MORE THAN 100 EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN TOLD TO  DEVISE PLANS TO REDUCE COMMUTER TRAFFIC.  </P> <P> The number of Ventura County businesses that offer employees four-day weeks and  other alternative work schedules could double in the next four years as firms  struggle to meet new pollution-control standards, experts believe.  </P> <P> In an effort to fight smog, the county has ordered large businesses to find  ways to reduce the number of times employees drive to work alone each week. One  suggestion offered by the county is to cut back the number of days that  employees are required to work.  </P> <P> "One of the most promising strategies is the compressed workweek," said Gail  Matz, a transportation specialist for the county Air Pollution Control  District.  </P> <P> "It's a win-win situation: Studies have shown employees on compressed workweeks  generally are more satisfied with their jobs, their morale is higher and they  and supervisors feel productivity is greater."  </P> <P> Currently, an estimated 11% of the county's more than 700 businesses with 50 or  more employees offer a compressed workweek -- which means that 40 hours of work  are compressed into fewer than five days, according to Commuter Transportation  Services of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> The private, nonprofit organization has studied revised work schedules and  their effect on pollution, transportation and work conditions at companies  throughout Southern California, said Stuart Anderson, planning manager for the  business.  </P> <P> Anderson said he anticipates that the number of businesses using compressed  schedules will double as companies try to comply with a regulation of the Air  Pollution Control District designed to bring Ventura County into compliance  with state and federal clean-air laws.  </P> <P> In November, the district began sending notices to 200 county businesses that  have more than 100 employees, Matz said. Those employers have 120 days to come  up with plans to reduce vehicle ridership among employees, Matz said.  </P> <P> In August, 1991, businesses with more than 75 employees will fall under the  district regulation, and companies with more than 50 employees will become  subject to the regulations in January, 1992. Companies that fail to achieve  specific goals are not penalized under the program, but if they do not submit  any plan at all they can be fined up to $25,000 daily.  </P> <P> The companies may choose from a number of options to reduce the car trips  employees make alone. They can offer financial incentives for employees who  car-pool or use public transit. They can build lockers and showers for workers  who bike or walk. Or, they can supply deterrents to driving, like charging for  parking in the company lot.  </P> <P> But the most promising way of reducing ridership is the restructuring of work  schedules, Matz said. A schedule like the four-day week, in which employees  work four 10-hour days a week, immediately cuts 20% of the trips to the office,  officials said. The 9-80 plan, which requires employees to work 80 hours over  nine days every two weeks, is another option.  </P> <P> Indeed, Ventura County's two largest employers already are looking into  compressed schedules.  </P> <P> The county is negotiating with labor unions to see if it can offer its 6,500  employees the option of a compressed workweek, said Susan Van Abel, an  administrative analyst in the county Chief Administrative Office.  </P> <P> Some county departments already use the compressed schedules effectively. And a  survey of employees in three county departments that tested the schedules in a  six-month trial program that ended in April showed a highly favorable response,  officials said.  </P> <P> Of the 300 people who participated in the trial run, 83% said morale improved,  50% indicated an increase in productivity and 74% indicated increased job  satisfaction.  </P> <P> However, some problems cropped up, Van Abel said. Some employees had trouble  completing their work in four days. And important meetings sometimes fell on  days off, she said.  </P> <P> The Navy's Pacific Missile Test Center at Point Mugu, where 9,700 civilians and  military personnel are on the payroll, also is running a pilot project with the  100 employees in its Human Resources Office. The Navy base is considering  adopting the 9-80 work schedule for its 5,000 civilian workers to help reduce  pollution, Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto said.  </P> <P> But fighting smog has not always been the impetus behind using the compressed  workweek.  </P> <P> The Oxnard Police Department implemented the four-day week for patrol officers  in 1975 so overlapping shifts would put more police officers on city streets  during times of high crime. The county Public Social Services Agency switched  400 of its 750 employees to the 9-80 schedule in 1975 because social workers  and welfare eligibility officers needed longer weekends to combat the stress of  the job, said Curt Hansen, personnel officer for the agency.  </P> <P> And other county agencies also switched employees to revised schedules years  ago.  </P> <P> In the county assessor's office, 55% of the 143 employees work a four-day week.  The office adopted the schedule in 1973 because assessors were losing valuable  work time during the commute to properties in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks.  The longer day allowed them to stay and work longer, Assistant Assessor Glenn  Gray said.  </P> <P> The road maintenance division of the county Public Works Agency switched 76  employees to the four-day week in the mid-1970s to reduce fuel consumption  during the energy crisis.  </P> <P> It ran smoothly for the most part. However, Loren Blair, deputy director of  public works, said some unexpected problems arose.  </P> <P> Machine operators had to adjust to the longer day. And, unexpectedly, some  employees had problems with the longer weekends.  </P> <P> Encouraged to pursue more hobbies with the extra time off, some employees began  buying expensive recreational items and ran into some financial problems, Blair  said.  </P> <P> But the grumbling soon stopped and the program runs smoothly, he said.  </P> <P> And employees at other businesses give the shorter weeks rave reviews, saying  the long weekends let them spend more time with their families, devote energy  to other pursuits and just plain relax.  </P> <P> About 30 officers in the Oxnard Police Department are attending college on  their days off to complete bachelor's or master's degrees, Oxnard Police Lt.  Tom Cady said. Five officers used their days off to coach different sports  programs, such as junior varsity teams at local high schools.  </P> <P> And some officers have devoted the extra time to developing businesses on the  side.  </P> <P> Officer Mike Alford, 43, began a boat-repair business during his days off three  years ago. The business, which grew to the point that Alford had to hire three  employees, brings in about $5,000 a month, he said.  </P> <P> The plan also has received rave reviews from officers in the Ventura Police  Department, which switched patrol officers to the schedule in 1972.  </P> <P> "They'd fight to the death to make sure the schedule's maintained," Ventura  Police Lt. A.J. Farrar said. Close to 70% of the department's 122 sworn  officers and 70 civilian employees are on the schedule, he said.  </P> <P> Cpl. John Leach of the Ventura Police Department had been a homicide detective  for 11 years when he decided to return to patrols, partly in order to enjoy the  three-day weekends.  </P> <P> "There are some guys who will stay in patrol forever just because of that,"  Leach said.  </P></p>

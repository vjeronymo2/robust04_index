			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Brawl adds to the drama of electing Italy's next president THE politics of electing Italy's ninth president turned into pure theatre yesterday. In the first special session of the joint houses of Parliament, everyone voted in the knowledge that no candidate stood the chance of success. Nor was any candidate intended to succeed by obtaining the necessary two thirds majority of the 1,014 potential voters. The only deviation from the script was a minor brawl before voting, provoked by a deputy of the neo fascist MFI party who shouted 'Robbers]' at his Christian Democrat colleagues. The insult touched an especially raw nerve yesterday since Senator Seve Citrisi, the Christian Democrats' national treasurer had just been served with notice of investigation in the ever-expanding Milan municipal corruption scandal. This procedure might have seemed a perverse way of finding a new head of state to replace Mr Francesco Cossiga who resigned on April 25th, two months before his seven year term was due to end. But when all the 16 parties in parliament have been unable to agree in advance, either among themselves or between each other, it made subtle sense. Like bridge players opening the bidding to discover strengths of the other's hand, the parties put forward their own, usually disposable, candidates to test how their members would vote on a whip. It was therefore virtually meaningless that the candidate who garnered the most votes was Mr Giorgio Di Giuseppe, an insignificant Christian Democrat and among the least supported was a politician with a reasonable chance of success, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the republic's interim president. Simply the Christian Democrats possessed the largest number of votes and the republicans are one of the smallest parties. Mr De Giuseppe, a worthy southern back bencher, was drafted on the day as the Christian Democrats flag bearer after the party had failed to decide among its various factions whom to back and what alliances to form. The 296 votes he chalked up were for the party not him. The parties' heavyweights like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister, and Mr Arnaldo Forlani, the secretary, held back to study form. Mr Andreotti, ever the master of ambiguity, sat hunched in his seat - not a trace of emotion to suggest the presidency remains his final ambition after 40 years in government. Every other party heavily backed its own players as expected. Such was the predictability of the first round that only a handful of deputies bothered to remain in the vast ornate parliament chamber to hear the results announced. Most were already milling in the main bar (which looked like the saloon of a transatlantic liner) or trading alliances behind closed doors. The party bosses appear to have decided to play for time until the fourth round and after when the two thirds majority of 676 votes alters to a simple majority of 508. This phase is not likely to begin until Friday. The main problem with the election process is that the outoing four party coalition lacks a convincing majority and is uncertain whether to plump for a well known figure of their own in the hope of finding other allies. The joker in the pack remains the populist Lombard League with 80 decisive votes. The Leagues abstained in protest at their exclusion from the choice of 58 regional councillors chosen to vote with the two chambers.</p>

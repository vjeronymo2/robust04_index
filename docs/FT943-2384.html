			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Washington opposes suit over Brazil debt The US government has stepped in to oppose a lawsuit filed by a big US family investor seeking repayment of Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 900m) of bank loans to Brazil, bought in the secondary market. The investor - the Dart family whose fortune derives from the invention of the polystyrene cup - refused to join a Dollars 52bn bank debt restructuring accord completed in April. The Dart suit, filed in US federal court in Manhattan, among other things, seeks payment of interest arrears. Washington's statement of interest argues: 'The US has a strong interest in encouraging voluntary restructuring of sovereign debt' and that a successful claim by the Darts 'would serve to undermine that interest'. It said that the US had in the past sought to discourage the use of the courts by debtor governments, so as to encourage negotiation over voluntary debt restructurings. It said, now that a secondary market in such debt had developed (its turnover last year was Dollars 1,978bn), it did not want to encourage creditors to use the courts. However, lawyers for the Darts are likely to argue that the statement refers to only one of the eight counts cited by the Darts - that of accelerated repayment. They may also argue that the US government position undermines the rights of investors who bought their loans in the secondary market, and that a judgment in its favour would hurt secondary market prices for bank loans. Last week, the presiding judge dismissed a request from the Darts' lawyers for summary judgement in the case and said she would consider a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the eight counts have legal defects. If she fails to dismiss the case, the Darts' lawyers will elaborate their claim on October 7, and the Brazilian government will respond by October 28. Under the 1988 agreement covering the bank loans held by the Darts, holders of more than 50 per cent of the loans could demand immediate repayment from the Brazilian government. To prevent the Darts from using this clause - after all other creditors had converted their loans in the 1994 agreement, the Darts would have been the biggest holders - Braslia made sure that the state-owned Banco do Brasil kept a larger holding of the 1988 loans. The Darts argue this is improper. Angus Foster reports from Sao Paulo: In a move that marks a setback for the government, Brazil's car workers went back to work yesterday after manufacturers and unions had agreed at the weekend to a one-off payment to solve the week-long dispute. Workers will receive a special bonus equivalent to about 25 per cent of this month's salary. Manufacturers also agreed to bring forward the annual pay round for many workers, now to take place in November instead of April. The government, worried that pay rises will fuel inflation in its new currency, the Real, had sought to delay wage increases as along as possible. Government officials have said they will try to stop companies raising prices so soon after the Real's launch. But manufacturers have promised the government that the one-off payment will be paid for by productivity gains and will not be passed on through higher prices.</p>

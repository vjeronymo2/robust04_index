The variety of crops cultivated and applied in agriculture  has increased three times over the past thirty years since the  publication of the socialist rural theses (February 1964).    Methods of farming suitable for different areas and soil  have  been completed on the principle of the right crop in the right  time and the right crop on the right soil.    Noteworthy is the completion of the method of farming on the  northern highlands 1,000 to 1,400 metres above sea level and of  the two-crop farming method in South Hwanghae and Kangwon  Provinces and other areas with a relatively mild weather.    Along with this, scientific and technological problems have  been satisfactorily solved in the irrigation, comprehensive  mechanization and extensive application of chemicals in  agriculture.    The study and development of various kinds of chemical  fertilizers and herbicides suited to conditions for the growth  of crops raised their qualitative composition.    A large number of modern farm machines have been invented  and  introduced and nearly all farm work is done with the help of  machines.    The great leader President Kim Il-song, always paying deep  attention to the development of the nation's agriculture, saw to  it that chuche-based agro-science research institutions were set  up.    More than 180 branches and experimental farms have been  built  in all provinces since the agro-science research centre was  built in December 1948.    Training centres for agro-scientists and technicians were  built up.    Hundreds of thousands of agro-scientists and experts are  active in the agricultural sector.    The development of agro-science brought about a rapid growth  of agricultural production.    Over the past thirty years after the publication of the  rural  theses the production of grain increased 1.9 times, of which  rice 1.8 times and maize 2.2 times.    The number of tractors and lorries engaged in the  agricultural domain increased six and five times respectively.    The amount of chemical fertilizers per hectare rose to more  than two tons from 300 kilograms.</p>

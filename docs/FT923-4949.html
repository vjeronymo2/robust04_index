			<p>920903 FT  03 SEP 92 / Survey of Distribution Services (9): Operators keep their cool - Safety scare leads to tighter laws on temperature controls A SERIES of food safety scares in 1988 and resulting UK government legislation have had a marked impact on temperature-controlled distribution activities over the last couple of years. On the technological side, for example, distribution service operators have invested heavily in sophisticated new temperature-monitoring systems for their vehicles. They have also stepped up staff training to try and ensure higher standards of operational management control. In a separate development, the movement of fresh produce, in particular, has become an increasingly pan-European affair. And with creation of the European Community Single Market now imminent, that trend is expected to become even more pronounced. The overall result is that the distribution of chilled and other temperature-sensitive products - often referred to by the industry as the 'cool chain' - has become an increasingly specialised business. Current patterns of temperature-controlled distribution activity began to emerge during the mid-1980s as leading retailers led the way towards consolidated operations. Previously, retail outlets had tended to take deliveries from individual manufacturers, so-called van sales. 'A better cool chain arrived almost by default as improving technology was incorporated into these consolidation centres,' comments Mr Mike Burbage, managing director of Wincanton Distribution. 'Also, the type of refrigerated vehicles required for larger consolidated drops were of a better type than those which were used previously for van sales. Numerous other benefits emerged, too, particularly improved information technology systems which enabled shorter lead times, less inventory, better sales forecasting and so on.' Concurrent with those changes, some of the manufacturers who had traditionally tended to control their own temperature-controlled distribution operations began to contract out such activities to specialist service providers. However, while cool chain standards had in many cases already reached high levels of safety and sophistication by the late 1980s, the food safety scares of 1988 undoubtedly gave that development a further boost. One of the main thrusts of recent UK government legislation on food safety as far as distribution activities are concerned has centred on establishing a series of new temperature control limits for goods in transit. In April this year, for example, it became necessary to ensure that temperature-controlled foods carried in small vehicles (7.5 tonnes or below) are kept at or below 8 degrees C. The same stipulation for food carried on larger vehicles was established as law in April last year. As a third stage in that legislation, April 1 next year will see the introduction of regulations requiring certain foods to be kept at or below 5 degrees C, except in small delivery vehicles. Generally, the UK's new food safety legislation has been welcomed by the leading distribution service operators in that sector. They say the biggest impact is being felt at what is generally accepted as the weakest link in the supply chain - the point of interface with the supplier or manufacturer where each individual driver is responsible for accepting products into that chain. In that context, Mr Bruce Giles, a regional director with Christian Salvesen Distribution, emphasises the importance of proper driver training. 'The regulations mean that the industry needs to make certain that all drivers are equally well trained and equipped to accept responsibility for this crucial decision and for any others that may need to be taken by them throughout the rest of the supply chain,' he adds. In addition to better training of drivers and other staff, companies operating vehicles in the temperature-controlled distribution sector have also invested in new equipment. One particularly prominent development in that context has involved the widespread installation of more sophisticated temperature-monitoring systems on distribution fleet vehicles. Mr Ian Veitch, business development director of Exel Logistics Temperature Controlled Services, says there is a growing emphasis on computer-controlled systems which will record temperatures throughout a delivery run. 'Some retailers are now saying we should be able to present a complete temperature history of their products,' he adds. Wincanton Distribution has also introduced movable curtains in certain vehicles to segregate chilled products from empty cages which, it says, can carry a lot of latent heat. Other moves by Wincanton include the introduction of dual evaporator fridges and under-slung fridges which reduce noise and operate at lower CFC levels. Recent years have seen considerable fluctuations in specification demands of chilled distribution vehicles. In the early days of consolidated or composite deliveries, for example, vehicles were often divided into two or three compartments, each operating at different temperatures. Then, as retail outlets increased in size and drop sizes grew larger, so demand increased for vehicles to make full load deliveries of one particular range of products. Now, says Mr David Howes, managing director of Christian Salvesen Distribution, there are signs of a renewed demand for two-temperature vehicles. 'There are two conflicting trends at work. On the one hand, you have the large out-of-town retail stores taking more full loads of chilled or ambient goods. But at the same time, the major retailers are opening up smaller outlets in smaller towns which is once again increasing the demand for composite deliveries.' Another trend in the field of temperature-controlled distribution involves a growing demand from users for added value services. Included in that category, are tray washing, waste management, recycling of packaging materials, bar coding of imported fresh produce, and the in-store maintenance of freezer/chilled cabinets. Demand is also growing for pan-European distribution operations. That trend, says Mr Veitch of Exel Logistics TCS, is particularly evident in the fresh produce sector. 'Manufacturers and suppliers are increasingly looking at the economies of scale benefits to be gained from supplying customers from one European point,' he adds. Further evidence of that trend comes from European transport company P &amp; O Ferrymasters which recently took delivery of 20 x 13.6-metre tri-axle refrigerated trailers to support the development of specialised operations which include twice-daily shipments of temperature-controlled products between the UK and Holland.</p>

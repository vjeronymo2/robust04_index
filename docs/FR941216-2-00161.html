			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 15A(b)(11) empowers the NASD to adopt rules governing the form and content of quotations relating to securities in the Nasdaq market. Such rules must be designed to produce fair and informative quotations, prevent fictitious and misleading quotations, and promote orderly procedures for collecting and distributing quotations. The NASD is seeking to continue the effectiveness of the Interim SOES Rules so that SOES activity may not result in misleading quotations in the Nasdaq market. Market makers place quotes in the Nasdaq system and these quotes comprise the inside market and define the execution parameters of SOES. When volatility in the SOES environment causes market makers to widen spreads or to change quotes in anticipation of waves of SOES orders, quotes in the Nasdaq market become more volatile and may be misleading to the investing public. Accordingly, absent continuation of the Interm SOES Rules, the quotations published by Nasdaq may not reflect the true market in a security and, as a result, there may be short-term volatility and loss of liquidity in Nasdaq securities, to the detriment of the investing public. Further, the continuation of the automated refresh feature will ensure that a market maker's quotation is updated after an exposure limit is exhausted. Uninterrupted use of this function will maintain continuous quotations in Nasdaq as market makers exhausting their exposure limits in SOES will not be subject to a ``closed quote'' condition or an unexcused withdrawal from the market. Finally, the NASD notes that despite the reduction in the maximum order size for SOES, market makers are still obligated to adhere to minimum display size requirements for quotations in Nasdaq National Market securities and Nasdaq SmallCap securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with significant national market system objectives contained in Section 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act. This provision states it is in the public interest and appropriate for the protection of investors and the maintenance of fair and orderly markets to assure, among other things, (i) economically efficient execution of securities transactions; (ii) fair competition among brokers and dealers; and (iii) the practicality of brokers executing investor orders in the best market. Specifically, the Interim SOES Rules advance each of these objectives by preserving the operational efficiencies of SOES for the processing of small investors' orders, by maintaining current levels of market maker participation through reduced financial exposure from unpreferenced orders exceeding 500 shares, and by reducing price volatility and the widening of market makers' spreads in response to the practices of order entry firms active in SOES. With respect to the proposal to remove the short sale prohibition from SOES, by expanding the spectrum of retail orders that will be eligible to receive automatic executions through SOES, the NASD believes the proposal may enhance investor protection. Nonetheless, the NASD is very concerned that re-allowing the entry of short sales into SOES may contribute to destabilizing short term trading through SOES that could have adverse corollary effects throughout Nasdaq. <FOOTCITE>25</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 25 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As indicated above, the NASD will review the volume and impact of short sales effected through SOES on an on-going basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, for the same reasons provided by the SEC when it approved the Interim SOES Rules that are cited above in the text accompanying footnotes four through eleven, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  NASD believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Sections 15A(b)(6), 15A(b)(9), 15A(b)(11), and 11A(a)(1)(C) of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

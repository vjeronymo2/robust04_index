			<p><P> October 19, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TORTOISE KEEPER FEARS 'TANK' IS IN THE SOUP  </P> <P> "Sherman Tank," mascot of the San Fernando Valley chapter of the California  Turtle and Tortoise Club, has been tortoise-napped, his caretaker says.  </P> <P> Jan Gordon of Sylmar said Wednesday she worries that the unusually large  California desert tortoise met his end in a soup pot or has been sacrificed in  a satanic ritual.  </P> <P> Gordon said he disappeared Sept. 22 and could not have escaped because a  six-foot fence anchored in cement surrounds the yard. She has had no reply to  flyers offering a $50 reward.  </P> <P> Or he may have been sold, Gordon said. A prized tortoise like 50-year-old  Sherman Tank -- an 18-pounder who stretches 19 inches from beak to tail --  fetches $1,000 to $2,000 on the reptilian black market, she said.  </P> <P> "It's been a month now and I don't expect to see him again," said Gordon, who  is in charge of the chapter's turtle adoption program. "Anybody could have  taken him. They could have taken off in a car and gone God knows where."  </P> <P> And he was charming (well, for a tortoise).  </P> <P> "He would eat out of your hand," she said. "He'd rest his head on your foot, he  would sniff you and follow you anywhere."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the provisions in section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act ensure that resumption of entitlement to Medicare will begin without the 3-month waiting period that usually applies in cases when Medicare entitlement is sought on the basis of dialysis (except for certain cases involving self-care training).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Proposed Revision to ESRD Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We analyzed the payment records of patients who terminated dialysis shortly after becoming eligible for Medicare based on a diagnosis of ESRD. Our records indicate an annual mean cost per patient of approximately $8,000, which is significantly below the average annual cost of $40,000 for a patient who remains on dialysis. Because these individuals were able to discontinue dialysis shortly after beginning a course of treatment and incurred only limited medical costs, we believe that many of these patients may have been incorrectly certified as having ESRD as a result of physicians misinterpreting the ESRD definition as it appears in &sect;406.13(b). We also find the current ESRD definition (&sect;406.13(b)) inadequate for Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) eligibility and entitlement purposes because entitlement to Medicare based on ESRD depends on the existence of ESRD, not on the sole fact that dialysis treatments are being given. Therefore, in order to eliminate any possible misinterpretation, we propose to revise the definition of ESRD in &sect;406.13(b). After the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* a regular course of dialysis'', we propose to add the word ``treatments''. This revision would clarify that more than one dialysis treatment is required for there to be a regular course of dialysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We also propose to add to the end of the definition of ESRD, the phrase ``as evidenced by generally accepted diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings''. We believe that requiring generally accepted diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings as the basis for diagnosis of ESRD serves as a reminder to physicians that they must have medical evidence to substantiate their certification of ESRD. We do not believe this addition to the definition would have a substantial effect on most physicians since they already depend on such medical information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We do not believe it is necessary to add the word ``treatments'' or the phrase ``as evidenced by generally accepted diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings'' to the definition of ESRD in &sect;405.2102, which defines ESRD as it relates to the conditions for coverage of suppliers of ESRD services. This is because that section does not establish who is eligible or entitled to Medicare ESRD benefits, which is the purpose of this proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AND ALL THE WORLD SHALL KNOW OUR LAWS;  </P> <P> INTERVENTION: OVERLOADED WITH A SENSE OF ITS OWN MORAL SUPERIORITY, THE U.S.  NOW THINKS IT CAN IMPOSE ITS JUSTICE ON OTHERS WILLY-NILLY.  </P> <P> What has happened in Panama, climaxing in the removal of Gen. Manuel Noriega to  the United States, is part of a pattern of recent U.S. conduct that is of  considerable novelty and significance.  </P> <P> This has not been just one more U.S. military intervention in the Americas.  Past interventions were usually commercial, protecting U.S. investments or  "restoring order." The invasion of Cuba in 1898, and of what now is Panama  (then Colombian territory) in 1903, grew out of imperialist assumptions  characteristic of the period.  </P> <P> Post-1945 U.S. interventions -- Guatemala in 1954, the Bay of Pigs in 1960, the  Dominican Republic in 1965, Grenada in 1983, the Contras in Nicaragua in the  Reagan years -- were given ideological justification. They defended Texas and  New Mexico against communism. (Vietnam was held to be the first line of defense  for Hawaii.)  </P> <P> But with Panama we have a new and radical argument. The United States invaded  Panama in order to seize a chief of state held to be a fugitive from U.S.  justice. The invasion followed findings by Administration lawyers that American  law-enforcement agents and soldiers have the authority to seize fugitives  abroad, in disregard of the sovereignty of other governments.  </P> <P> After the failed Oct. 3 coup attempt in Panama, the White House also made it  known that it was re-examining rules concerning the assassination of foreign  chiefs of state and other persons, posing the question, according to a Bush  Administration spokesman, as to whether "a less restrictive reading" of the  Ford Administration's executive order banning involvement in assassinations  "would be in the national interest." Other states might commit assassinations,  but only the United States proposes it as national policy.  </P> <P> Earlier in 1988, the United States kidnaped a drug dealer in Honduras, again  because of an indictment in the United States, thereby provoking an angry  Honduran reaction. Before that, the Justice Department made it known that it  contemplated legal action in U.S. courts against the prime minister of the  Bahamas, against Ferdinand Marcos (when he was president of the Philippines)  and against Egypt's defense minister (for an alleged intelligence operation  targeting U.S. technology).  </P> <P> These matters of criminal justice have been accompanied by efforts by the U.S.  government to extend the reach of American business and banking law, and  securities trading restrictions, to countries abroad. A Justice Department  official said in 1988 that "we have to prove to the world that our legal system  is one that stands for the proposition that crime will not be condoned whatever  the offender's state or status."  </P> <P> What this translates to, of course, is that the United States will, to the best  of its ability, unilaterally impose its conceptions of law, justice and  national interest within other countries, in disregard of their sovereignty. It  surely amounts to a proposition that the United States considers itself beyond  the constraints of international law and convention.  </P> <P> In a brilliant new book on the cultural implications of World War I, "Rites of  Spring," Modris Eksteins of the University of Toronto writes that Germany in  August, 1914, "had no concrete war aims, only a strategy and a vision, that of  German expansion in an existential rather than a physical sense." Germans acted  from convictions of "moral superiority," "moral strength" and "moral right."  </P> <P> Because of this sense of moral superiority and moral isolation, "the Germans  had been, even before the war, the most readily inclined of the leading nations  to question the norms and values of 19th-Century liberal bourgeois society, to  elevate the moment beyond the grasp of the law."  </P> <P> From this followed Germany's wartime lack of scruple about violating Belgium's  neutrality, attacking civilian targets and introducing unrestricted submarine  warfare and gas and flame weapons, thus overturning what previously had been  the accepted morality of warfare among civilized nations. All of this, one  scarcely need add, ended very badly for the Germans, and for nearly everyone  else. We have since 1914 failed to recover that lost morality.  </P> <P> The analogy I draw is not a comfortable one. The parallel between America's  present challenge to international convention and law and that of Germany in  1914 obviously is relative, not absolute, and takes place in very different  international circumstances. Yet a parallel is there, and it is essential, I  think, that attention be drawn to it.  </P></p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Wider powers for DTI in deregulation bill: Government aims to repeal 'hundreds' of measures THE Department of Trade and Industry is to receive sweeping new powers enabling it to repeal hundreds of regulatory measures without having to refer to parliament. The new powers will be contained in a deregulation bill, to be announced in today's Queen's Speech. While the details of the bill will remain under wraps until later next month, Mr Neil Hamilton, minister of corporate affairs, said the government planned to get rid of 'hundreds of regulations' without seeking primary legislation. In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Mr Hamilton, who is spearheading the government's deregulation initiative, said: 'We are planning to clear out the accumulated dross of a number of bills without seeking primary legislation which would clog up parliament.' He made it clear that the DTI would have new powers to repeal by order many statutory instruments, which allow ministers to make regulations without the specific order of parliament. Mr Hamilton was scathing about many of the country's 'mushrooming regulations', which he said had become an intolerable burden on bus-iness. The minister plans to use the new powers to roll back the boundaries of regulation, although he has not yet decided which specific regulations will be repealed. But he made it clear that he is prepared to question all red tape by singling out the Financial Services Act, which underpins City regulation. He said it had given rise to many non-statutory rules. In response to well-publicised fraud cases in the 1980s, Mr Hamilton said the government was criticised by parliament for not being 'draconian enough' in cracking down on insider dealing. So it had introduced more regulation in the form of the FSA. 'This goes to the heart of the problem,' he said. 'You either take a proportionalist or absolutist view of how to deal with problems.' Mr Hamilton said he was aware that much of what he was proposing was controversial, but said it was essential that somebody asked difficult questions. 'In the past there has been no scientific method of opposing regulation.' A series of seven business taskforces is busy identifying regulations that could be scrapped after the contents of the deregulation bill are published. The bill will also ensure that before new legislation is introduced, ministers will be forced to complete what Mr Hamilton called a compliance cost assessment - how much it will cost industry and small businesses. Mr Hamilton said he would not allow what he called the 'Sir Humphrey syndrome' in Whitehall to cause his initiative to run into the sands.</p>

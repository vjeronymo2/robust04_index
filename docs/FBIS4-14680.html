			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Russian-Hungarian treaty on burying processed  nuclear fuel on the territory of our country is quite  advantageous for Russia, Viktor Mikhaylov, minister of nuclear  power engineering, told INTERFAX. Let me remind you that during  his visit to Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed  an agreement under which processed nuclear fuel from Hungarian  nuclear power stations is to be brought to Russia, for which our  country is to be paid 40 million dollars. Here is a report from  our correspondent.    [Correspondent Yevgeniya Novikova] Russia is still receiving  radioactive waste from foreign nuclear power stations under  international agreements once concluded by the Soviet Union.  This concerns only those stations that were built by the Soviet  Union on its neighbors' territory, and with which appropriate  agreements were concluded. According to Greenpeace, processed  nuclear fuel is currently stored on the territory of combines in  Chelyabinsk and Krasnoyarsk, where the ecological situation has  already caused a high incidence of radiation sickness and  oncological diseases among the population.

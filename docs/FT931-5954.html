			<p>930303 FT  03 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading DERIVATIVES markets lacked enthusiasm yesterday, and the March futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index made no attempt to provide a lead for the underlying stock market. However, it maintained its good premium over cash and reflected underlying confidence which was not seriously dented by indications from the Bundesbank that cuts in German interest rates are unlikely to be announced at tomorrow's policy meeting. For most of the day, the premium over the Footsie held at around 5 points, contrasting with the 4-point discount to the fair value premium calculated by most market traders. However, after the official close, the March contract touched the 2,900 mark, close to the all-time high on the underlying stock market and the focus of investment attention at present. Turnover was disappointing, with the day's total of 6,077 contracts barely half of some recent daily figures. The heavyweight securities houses were largely absent from the market and locals had little incentive to take positions. Increased activity in traded options, where contracts totalled 32,344, against 18,536 the previous day, left aside the FT-SE 100 contract, where only 4,986 lots were traded, against 5,622 on Monday. The Euro FT-SE traded a total of 9,001, while BP led the league table among the stock options, with 3,696 lots as US funds secured stock.</p>

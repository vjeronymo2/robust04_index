			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Mexican government has decided to accept the nomination of John D.  Negroponte to be U.S. ambassador to Mexico despite widespread criticism from  opposition political parties and the Foreign Ministry. Negroponte, who served  as American ambassador to Honduras at the height of the Contra war against the  Nicaraguan government, has been critical of Mexican foreign policy. While  Mexico is not happy with President Bush's choice for the post, it decided to  accept Negroponte to avoid confrontation with the Bush Administration, Foreign  Ministry sources said.  </P></p>

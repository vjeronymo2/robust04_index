			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Budget buoys Hong Kong stock market STEEP cuts in taxation and higher spending on social programmes and public works were provided for in the annual budget presented by the Hong Kong government yesterday. Mr Hamish Macleod, the colony's financial secretary, said Hong Kong's gross domestic product, adjusted for inflation, would rise this year by 5.5 per cent compared with 5 per cent last year. Inflation is expected to hover just below 10 per cent. His budget cheered the stock market which ended the day 11 points away from its all-time high of 6,447, reached on November 12 last year. The market was also encouraged by signs that Britain and China were edging closer to an agreement to talk about Hong Kong's political development. Yesterday Governor Chris Patten announced that he would delay a visit to Japan so he could make a statement on the state of Anglo-Chinese talks about Hong Kong. Mr Patten will address the Legislative Council, LegCo, the colony's law making body, tomorrow where he also is expected to explain why the government has delayed publishing legislation that would give effect to his proposals for wider democracy in the colony. Mr Macleod described his budget as one which 'built on success'. He confidently forecast that Hong Kong would overtake Britain and Australia in terms of income per head this year and praised local businessmen for their ability to look 'beyond present political controversies' to the colony's long-term prospects. His budget was, however, unashamedly populist and designed to ensure a smooth passage through LegCo. More money was allocated for social security, housing, health and education. Tax allowances were over-indexed by twice the rate of inflation and the threshold at which income tax becomes payable was raised. Mr Macleod left the corporate tax rate unchanged at 17.5 per cent. He cut the rate of stamp duty on stock market transactions to 0.3 per cent from 0.4 per cent - at a cost of HKDollars 800m (Pounds 72m) to the revenue. He said that he would look sympathetically on further reductions in stamp duty. He also decided to bring forward a big roads programme. Tomorrow it will call for expressions of interest from the private sector to build a road linking Hong Kong's container port with the city of Shenzhen, which lies on the colony's northern border. This project involves the construction of a bridge and tunnel and would, by 1997, provide a direct road link from China's most productive regional economy to Hong Kong's modern port. Mr Macleod earmarked HKDollars 4bn for the government's contribution to the project. The combined effect of these and other measures is forecast to produce a budget deficit of nearly HKDollars 3.6bn for the 1993/94 fiscal year - the first deficit the Hong Kong government has forecast since the mid-1980s - and compares with an estimated budget surplus of HKDollars 20.5bn for 1992/93. This was up from an initial forecast of just HKDollars 7.5bn made a year ago. A combination of buoyant tax receipts and under spending by the Hong Kong government on public works were equally responsible for the higher surplus. In his medium-term outlook for the government's finances, Mr Macleod forecast continued budget deficits. These were due primarily to the building of a new airport and associated projects which, if completed on schedule, would be income producing by the time China resumed sovereignty of Hong Kong, he said. According to the projection, by 1997 the Hong Kong government's accumulated budget surplus should be more than HKDollars 78bn - well ahead of the HKDollars 25bn which Britain has agreed with China.</p>

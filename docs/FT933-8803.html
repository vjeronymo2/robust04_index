			<p>930813 FT  13 AUG 93 / Observer: Point of honour A romantic footnote has crept into the lengthy BCCI fraud trial now drawing to a close in New York. As the jurors were being asked to decide whether the Washington lawyer Robert Altman was honest or whether he helped BCCI to cheat US bank regulators, there was an unexpected cry of objection, your honour. It had nothing to do with the four months of testimony or the hundreds of boxes of documents. Much more down to earth. Altman's defence attorney felt sure that one of the jurors, an attractive, single, thirtysomething from New York's upper west side, had made eyes at the prosecutor, Manhattan district attorney and Chevy Chase lookalike John Moscow. Altman's lawyer complained that the juror had given Moscow 'long, lingering looks' and 'mouthed hellos' during the five-month trial. Moscow, nicknamed the 'Romeo DA' after he married a juror 12 years ago, disagreed strongly and said that the juror was just being 'attentive'. However, the judge had also noticed the juror's 'peculiar behaviour and strange body language'. She was summarily dismissed.</p>

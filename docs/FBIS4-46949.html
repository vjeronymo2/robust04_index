			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Natalya Varnavskaya under the rubric "Taxation </F> of Receipts of Foreigners": "Russians Must Pay for Their Foreign  Partners"]    [Text] The State Tax Service has clarified the  question of which particular receipts of foreign legal entities  generated by them on the territory of Russia Russian companies  must pay taxes on. A letter of the tax department, the official  distribution of which began yesterday, contains a quite detailed  and specific listing of such receipts of foreign companies taxed  "at the source of payment." The new document has considerably  expanded the list of taxable receipts which, in the opinion of  KOMMERSANT experts, may be viewed as a harsher tax regimen.    In keeping with existing taxation procedures, only  foreign companies operating on the territory of Russia through  permanent representative offices pay taxes on profits through  general procedures. Taxes on foreign legal entities which do not  have permanent representative offices in Russia but generate  receipts on its territory are levied in a special way--at the  source of payment. This tax is withheld by the enterprise that  pays receipts to a foreign legal entity in the currency in which  the payment is made, from the full amount of receipts when each  transfer toward the payment is made.    The new letter of the State Tax Service is devoted to the  taxation of receipts of foreign legal entities not operating  through permanent representative offices. The document specifies  what exactly amounts to taxable receipts in their case. In  particular, as the letter notes, in addition to receipts for  leasing property located on the territory of Russia, the tax  should also be withheld on receipts from the increment in the  cost of property received as a result of its conveyance, for  example, sale. The notion of "taxable interest receipts" has  been expanded considerably: Not only will amounts due on debt  obligations now be taxed at the source, but also the interest on  insurance premiums, fines, or penalties for violation of  contractual obligations.    However, innovations concerning the taxation of trading  broker operations attracted the greatest attention of KOMMERSANT  experts. The tax is still not levied on the receipts of foreign  companies from trading operations. However, when imported goods  are sold in Russia on trading brokerage terms (for example,  under a consignment contract), the Russian company will have to  withhold the tax prior to remitting abroad the portion of  receipts generated by the sale of goods and due to the foreign  company.    In the process, the amount of such receipts will be  determined as the difference between the sale price set by the  foreign company and the price at which the Russian intermediary  actually sold the goods. Of course, in this case the  "difference" means the amount directly remitted to the foreign  company; the receipts of the Russian enterprise are taxed  through usual procedures.    It is significant that these procedures for the calculation  of taxable income may only be used if documents confirming the  importation of goods from abroad by a foreign legal entity are  available. The entire amount of gross proceeds paid to the  foreign company will be taxed otherwise. It is quite  understandable that agreements on the avoidance of dual taxation  between Russia and other states which are in force are taken  into account in the taxation of receipts.    The new expanded listing of the receipts of foreign legal  entities taxed at the source of receipts which takes effect at  the time of official publication will make it possible for the  tax organs to considerably replenish the Russian treasury and  solve the problem of the failure of foreign companies to pay  taxes on receipts generated on the territory of Russia.    [Boxed item] Amounts received by foreign companies in the  following forms shall be taxed:    --receipts from the profits of an enterprise established in  Russia with foreign investment;    --additional remunerations for shareholders in monetary or  other form;    --profits distributed by check investment funds;    --interest on debt obligations of any kind, on various  insurance premiums, fines, and penalties for the violation of  contractual and debt obligations;    --receipts from the use of copyrights, inventions, trade  marks, and other similar assets, as well as the business  reputation, clients, and cadres of the company;    --receipts from leasing property located on the territory of  Russia, as well as receipts from the increment of the cost of  property generated as a result of its conveyance;    --all other receipts whose generation is not associated with  operations conducted through a permanent representative office,  including receipts for use of know-how, consultations, and  freight transportation.

			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Arts: Out of tune with its clients - The Arts Council has got itself into a sorry mess The Arts Council deserves no sympathy for the mess it has got itself into over the funding of the London orchestras. It was a ludicrous dereliction of duty to ask an outsider, Sir Leonard Hoffmann, to decide which of the three orchestras should continue to receive Council money. What on earth is the music panel for? So there is general satisfaction that Hoffmann has come up with a report that is obviously poison to many at the Council. His decision (on the vote of only two members of a five man committee) that the Philharmonia is marginally more deserving than the LPO totally upsets the apple cart. According to the Council's plan, the LPO was to get the vote, confirming its position as house orchestra at the South Bank, and a counter to the LSO at the Barbican. The Philharmonia and the RPO were to be left to their own, free market, devices. And the Arts Council would save money. That is the root of the problem. It is yet another example of the Arts Council's unresolved battle as to whether its role is to fight for the arts, or to give the government better value for its subsidy. There is a case to be made for funding a super orchestra: such a case explodes if it is a by-product of a scam to save money. It is a carbon copy of the fiasco the Council got itself into during the summer over its decision to cut funding to ten regional theatres. Once again the theory was respectable. Faced with the probability of a grant cut the Council took itself off to Woodstock to work out priorities, to back winners. For some bizarre reason it decided that modern dance and the visual arts (the two weakest sectors of its empire, with minimal popular or media support) should get cash at the expense of popular local theatres. In the face of an outcry, not least from its own drama panel, it changed its mind, and lost immeasurable face. From then on the Council has become an Aunt Sally, allowing the media to question its existence - and the position of its managers. The chairman Lord Palumbo goes in April, which looks fortuitous; his successor can be a new broom, untainted by the past. But now secretary general Anthony Everitt is vulnerable. His contract expires in the autumn and few would bet on a renewal. Yet the whole sorry saga is predictable and goes back to the appointment of Palumbo five years ago. He was given secret orders by the government to slim down the Council (saving money again), and to hand over the decisions on funding arts companies to a network of regional arts boards. Once the Council had abdicated most of its powers it had to find a role to justify its existence. Hence the chase after initiatives, all of which, from the bland and binned strategy for the arts document which emerged earlier this year to the theatre and orchestral debacles, have ended in tears. The final humiliation is that the government has reneged on its part of the bargain. It has harried the Council to make even more cuts in its budget than was reasonable, demanding an extra Pounds 600,000 in savings next year. It then put the boot in on November 30 by cutting the Council's grant for next year by Pounds 3.2m. This has proved especially humiliating because the National Heritage Secretary, Peter Brooke, actually secured a reasonable Pounds 21m increase in his total budget and could easily have given the Council a stand-still grant. On Wednesday the Scottish Office did just that for the Scottish Arts Council. All we need now is stories of bureaucratic extravagance in the regional arts boards after they get their heady new powers in April and the whole sorry story will be complete. The arms length principle of arts funding will be deemed to have failed and those in the Heritage Department who want to do away with the Council altogether will be in position to strike. Think of how much fun the civil servants, and ministers, will have in deciding just how much subsidy to hand out to thenational companies, like Covent Garden and the RSC, which will fall under their power. That everything in the arts is now back on the agenda is suggested by the delay in finding a successor for Lord Palumbo. Obviously anyone approached will want to know what, if anything, the job entails. Peter Brooke now has three choices. He can delay an appointment into the late spring and then give someone the task of winding up the Council. He can choose one of the great and the good - Sir Ernest Hall comes to mind - to go in there to smack heads, ease out dead wood, and build up confidence, assisted by the fact that the Council will soon have the task of distributing around Pounds 70m a year of Lottery money around the arts. Or Brooke can merge the jobs of unpaid chairman and salaried secretary general into one, putting in a proven administrator, like John Tusa, as a powerful chief executive. This is what happens at the National Endowment for the Arts in the US. Through its indecisiveness the Council has brought its very existence into doubt. What can it do now? On Wednesday it announces its grants for 1994-95 and will probably share the misery of reduced funding equally among the nation's arts companies. But by then it will also have to respond to Hoffmann. It will be terribly embarrassing if it rejects the Hoffmann findings. But if it accepts them where does this leave the LPO, only two years into a five year contract as the house orchestra of the South Bank, a residency pushed through, with money and encouragement by the Council? The LPO currently gets over Pounds 1.1m a year in subsidy: Hoffmann allocates it Pounds 700,000, insufficient to allow it to fulfill its programme. With more money somehow, the orchestras could be satisfied. But money is the one thing in short supply at the Arts Council. Peter Brooke, a professed believer in the arms length principle, has seen to that. Some arms are shorter than others.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T's hidden global agenda - Unisource alliance does not tell whole story Yesterday's announcement of an international telecoms alliance between AT&amp;T and Unisource, the joint venture between the national operators of Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands, was as significant for what it concealed as for what it revealed. While the Unisource deal confirms AT&amp;T's European ambitions, it raises questions about the group's strategy in Latin America and its future relationship with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK operator. The alliance with Unisource had been expected. A year ago, when AT&amp;T launched its Worldsource venture with KDD, the Japanese telecoms group, and Singapore Telecom, it said it needed European partners to be credible and planned to gain them by the end of 1994. Worldsource's brief is to exploit the market for one-stop facilities for multinational companies. Of an estimated 2,400 multinationals, 800 have facilities in Europe. Europe's markets are slowly opening up to competition from new entrants against national operators. An alliance with insiders was critical to AT&amp;T. British Telecommunications ruled itself out by forming a Dollars 5.3bn alliance with MCI, AT&amp;T's most bitter rival in the US long-distance market. AT&amp;T tried to secure the other two European telecoms giants, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. However, its efforts failed amid a growing perception that an alliance worth forging would probably fall foul of regulatory authorities unprepared to tolerate a union of three of the world's four largest telecoms operators. That left AT&amp;T with only one serious European option - Unisource, a joint venture launched earlier in the year. It was not just a process of elimination. Mr Alex Mandl, the Austrian-born chief executive of AT&amp;T's communications services division who masterminded the negotiations, did not underestimate the potential to weld Europe's smaller operators into a strong third force. Unisource's attraction to AT&amp;T was heightened by two alliances it formed last year: with Telefonica, the Spanish national operator; and with Sita, a global data network operator owned by airlines, aviation and freight companies, opening up a potentially lucrative market for 'one-stop' international telecoms services. Unisource was urgently seeking a US alliance. Earlier this year it came together with AT&amp;T in a successful bid to provide telecoms facilities to an association of more than 30 European multinationals. Yesterday's deal flowed from there. 'It brings us what we needed to make a strong competitor in this international market,' said Mr Viesturs Vucins, Unisource chief executive. For Unisource the benefits are worldwide reach; AT&amp;T's brand name; and access to AT&amp;T's standards and products, of which the most important is its corporate 'voice' networks, which Unisource plans to be marketing under the Worldsource brand by the end of this year. However, yesterday's announcement concealed two significant aspects of AT&amp;T's international strategy. First, its interest in Telefonica is only partly due to the Spanish operator's European presence: more important, analysts believe, is Telefonica's substantial interests in Latin America, where AT&amp;T's influence is weak and its vulnerability to competition growing. Telefonica is active in every sizeable Latin American market, apart from Brazil, and expects to draw at least 15 per cent of its revenue from the region this year. Through Telefonica International it has stakes ranging from 6 per cent to 79 per cent in operators in Chile, Argentina, Venezuela, Puerto Rico and Peru. AT&amp;T has been in talks about taking a stake in Telefonica International separately from its designs on Unisource. That option will remain open, even after Telefonica becomes an equity partner in Unisource - a move expected next month. AT&amp;T's immediate Latin American interests are defensive. The disparity between incoming and outgoing tariffs between the region and the US has stimulated a growth in operators offering 'call back' facilities from the US, costing AT&amp;T dear. The threat to AT&amp;T is not marginal. About 20 per cent of outgoing international calls from Venezuela are estimated to be made through 'call back' arrangements, with much of the traffic carried by AT&amp;T's US competitors. Mr Nick Smith, analyst with Credit Lynonnais Securities in Madrid, said: 'AT&amp;T wants to normalise the regime in Latin America, and Telefonica offers the best prospect of doing so.' The second aspect concerns AT&amp;T's relationship with Cable &amp; Wireless, the UK international operator as yet non-aligned in the battle for the multinationals. For the past year C&amp;W has claimed to be its own best strategic partner in the international arena. In reality, the group has been heavily engaged in negotiations with AT&amp;T. Mercury, its UK operation, came close to agreeing to join Worldsource earlier this month; Hongkong Telecom, by far C&amp;W's largest concern, is still in negotiations. C&amp;W claims that Hongkong Telecom can safely go its own way, since it is relatively insignificant to the global market for multinationals. But if AT&amp;T plugs into the heart of the C&amp;W group, speculation about the future of C&amp;W's limbs will inevitably escalate.</p>

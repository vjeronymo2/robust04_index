			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Mariya Oliynyk, chairman of the Donetsk </F> Oblast branch of the Congress of Ukrainian Nationalists, by  Viktor Verbych; place and date not given: "The Time Belongs to  Moscow, but Ukrainian Spring Is Already on the Doorstep"    }[Text] [Verbych] What is the life in this Russified land,  in which, apparently, pro-imperial and anti-Ukrainian forces are  currently dominating?    [Oliynyk] The life there, of course, is more interesting  than in Volyn. Perhaps it is much harder, but therefore more  interesting. The power of action equals the power of  counteraction. We must stay in good shape all the time, as  sportsmen say. We have united democratic national forces in the  Democratic Donetsk [Demokratychna Donechchyna] bloc, which  includes 15 organizations such as the Congress of Ukrainian  Nationalists, the Union of Ukrainian Youth, the Plast [scouting  organization], and the Prosvita [cultural society]. On the  other hand, procommunist forces are still very active there, as  they were before. Following the events that took place in  Moscow last October, however, it became obvious that they were  defeated. Pro-Yeltsin forces have recently come into prominence.    [Verbych] As a matter of fact, these forces are also  pro-imperial, but perhaps with more a considerable dose of  demagogy.    [Oliynyk] Exactly. They say that they support a market  economy and privatization, however, only in Russia -- claiming  that without it, we will not survive. Everything is oriented  toward Russia, even our time zone is the same as Moscow's,  according to a resolution of the Oblast Council.    [Verbych] Certain steps have been therefore taken toward  autonomy, and eventually toward seceding from the Ukrainian  state.    [Oliynyk] Do not forget about the so-called experiment:  Donetsk, Zaporizhzhya, Luhansk, and Dnipropetrovsk Oblasts form  a special economic zone. Moreover, the authors of the  experiment will not submit appropriate documents to the Supreme  Council for adoption, since they have already received support  from certain presidential circles. Everything will be resolved  by a presidential decree. Actually, one of the Crimean options  is being worked out in our oblast. A peculiar supreme council  of the four oblasts is to be established soon. The only thing  that distinguishes us from the Crimea is the fact that 51  percent of our population is Ukrainian (according to the 1989  census, during which many Ukrainians were registered as  Russians). Even those Russians who have been living in Donbas  for a long time, however, are not like those who bask in the  Crimean sun. The majority of people in Donetsk Oblast  understand who really wants what, and what have been, and will  be, the consequences of a pro-Moscow policy.    [Verbych] The authors of the experiment, however, hide  themselves under the slogan "in the name of the people," as the  Bolsheviks used to do. I would like to hear your opinion about  the Liberal Party headed by Markulov, who was recently an  adviser to Kravchuk. To what extent does this party advocate  the interests of the new pro-Moscow forces?    [Oliynyk] The Liberal Party does not register its members.  There have been statements claiming that the party has 6,000  members in the Donetsk region alone. However, how could this  number be substantiated if the party does not register its  members? This is nonsense. There were 200 people at the  party's electoral conference held on 6 November. I believe that  this is all the party's membership. The party is very different  in various regions. Whereas Kyselyova, vice president of the  Liberal Party's branch in Lvov, speaks Ukrainian, the party's  Donetsk branch is no different than communist forces. Our  liberals openly state: "Only together with Russia." On 3 June,  they, however, removed from their statute a resolution on  federalization and bilingualism. They could achieve success  only due to the fact that they have significant funds.    [Verbych] Mrs. Mariya, there are, of course, certain  achievements that testify to the fact that the Donetsk region is  an integral part of Ukraine.    [Oliynyk] It cannot be said that there are not, but there  are only a few such achievements. For example, we opened the  first Ukrainian school in 1990 with the help of the United  Nations. In 1993, it was much easier to open the 12th high  school in Donetsk and the first Ukrainian gymnasium in  Kramatorsk, which 450 children now attend. On 1 December 1993,  we managed to open the first Ukrainian kindergarten in  Donetsk.... You should know that the fact that our Ukrainian  people speak Russian does not mean that they are against  Ukrainian. The Ukrainian language is taught at the Ukrainian  high school, there are 11 Ukrainian groups at the university,  and one group at the medical institute. Whereas we had 23  Ukrainian classes in Donetsk last year, there are now 60 such  classes.    [Verbych] As the first and last president of the former USSR  used to say, the process has started.    [Oliynyk] Nobody is able to halt this. However, there still  are scouting camps, at which children wear red bandannas and  attend solemn meetings on 7 November [anniversary of the October  revolution]. Nevertheless, the stronghold of the empire is  receding into the past with every day and every hour. The  process continues! Without useless pathos, through our everyday  hard work, we endeavor to prevent a wedge from being driven  between Ukrainian territories, dividing them between East and  West.</p>

			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Lionheart in black with Pounds 0.5m and pays interim LIONHEART, the Cheshire-based paint brush manufacturer, home improvements and retail display systems group, has returned to profit and the dividend list. In the six months to June 30 the pre-tax profit was halved to Pounds 518,000 (Pounds 1.1m) - a recovery from the second half of last year when the group incurred a loss of Pounds 1.97m and passed its final. It had only resumed paying dividends in 1991 after reconstruction under Mr Paul Lever, the former chief executive of Crown Paints. Mr Lever said yesterday that cuts in overheads and improvements in margins had been underpinned by a small improvement in demand, with sales at Pounds 22.4m (Pounds 21.5m). All parts of the group were profitable in the first half and he expected recovery to continue. Earnings per share were 0.13p (0.48p). The interim dividend is 0.1p, against 0.2p. Mr Lever said new shower fittings designed by the Croydex subsidiary had been successfully launched, while Sloane, which makes bespoke merchandising units, had won strong business in the UK and US among compact disc, video and entertainments retailers. Lionheart is 20 per cent owned by Newell, the US paint brush company.</p>

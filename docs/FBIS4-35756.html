			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 2 Jun (MENA)--Two Egyptian experts returned  to Cairo from Khartoum today after the Sudanese authorities  refused, without giving a reason, to let them enter Sudan.    Engineer Muhammad Amin Muhammadayn, former Irrigation  Ministry under secretary and technical adviser to the Nile Water  Authority; and Dr. Muhammad Jasir, also a former Irrigation  Ministry under secretary and currently a professor at the  Institute of River Silt and Hydrology, left for Khartoum aboard  an Egyptian plane this morning at the Sudanese Government's  invitation to discuss several joint cooperation projects.    Upon his return to Cairo, engineer Muhammadayn said that the  Sudanese authorities refused to give any reason for banning him  and his colleague from entering the country.

			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Swiss banks win secrecy row Switzerland's banks appear to have won a landmark dispute with the federal prosecutor over disclosing account information of foreign clients suspected of criminal activities. The prosecutor has agreed not to transmit any information to a foreign authority unless there has been a formal request for legal assistance following a proper criminal investigation. The dispute arose last September when Mrs Carla del Ponte, the federal prosecutor, sent a list of names of 60 people belonging to the Sicilian Mafia to leading Swiss banks. Mrs del Ponte suggested to the banks that they make use of a new clause in the Swiss penal code giving them the right to denounce clients if criminal activity is suspected. Under the agreement, the federal prosecutor is free to suggest to a bank that it provides information on clients it can seek mediation through the Swiss Bankers' Association. If that fails, the final decision rests with the bank. However, a bank that knowingly harbours a client when there is strong evidence of law breaking violates Federal Banking Commission guidelines.</p>

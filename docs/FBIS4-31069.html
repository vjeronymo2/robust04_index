			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 5 Jun (TANJUG) -- We have unofficially  learned from sources close to the delegation of the Srpska  republic that late tonight, in talks between Yasushi Akashi, UN  special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, and representatives of  the Serb and Muslim-Croat delegations, an agreement was  eventually reached in principle to resume talks on a total  cessation of hostilities in Bosnia.    These talks, as Radovan Karadzic and Ejup Ganic agreed,  should start tomorrow at 1000 in the Palace of Nations in  Geneva, the sources of the Serb republic say. The only  precondition attached to this is a confirmation that "armed Serb  elements" have withdrawn from the security zone, i.e. 3 km  around Gorazde.    UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali is expected to arrive in  Geneva tonight. Akashi is believed to have invited the UN  secretary general to help him in saving the conference and the  reputation of the UN which is mediating in the peace talks. The  Muslim delegation has for four days been finding reasons to  delay the opening of the conference.    In all his contacts with the press Radovan Karadzic, head of  the delegation of the Srpska republic, has been constantly  saying: "We have come here to sign a peace and we do not set  any conditions."    According to statements by Akashi's press officer, the  conference has on several occasions been on the verge of being  canceled.</p>

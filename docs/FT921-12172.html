			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Parliament and Politics: EC funding row resurfaces - Regional Development THE ROW over the European Community's refusal to release funds for depressed UK regions resurfaced yesterday as Labour published leaked documents which it said undermined the government's assertion that the EC stance was unjustified. It was fuelled also by clashes in the Commons, as Labour MPs accused the government of the 'deceitful' diversion of the funds and demanded that ministers stop vilifying Mr Bruce Millan, the EC regional commissioner and a former Labour cabinet minister, over his role in events. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on the prime minister to resolve the issue at today's cabinet meeting. Downing Street said the matter was likely to be raised, but added that negotiations were continuing with the European Commission. The Commission has said that the money is at risk because of the UK government's refusal to give satisfactory assurances that the EC money would be in addition to the government's own planned expenditure. Mr Brown said the need for a resolution was now urgent, and pointed out that the documents warned that the most likely outcome was that the Commission would block payment to the UK of most or all of the Pounds 900m or so regional grants so that 'resources intended for the UK would in effect be diverted to other member states'. Officials, however, expressed doubt about the legality of diverting to other countries funds earmarked for the UK, and made the point that discussion of the regional and structural funds would have to be related to discussion about the cohesion funds agreed at the Maastricht summit. The cohesion funds will be for the poorer EC countries, while the structural funds are available to depressed regions in any EC member state. The Department of the Environment said the documents were written in July last year, and accompanied a letter from Mr Michael Heseltine, the environment secretary, to the Treasury arguing that the government position was untenable. The draft letter from Mr Heseltine was leaked by Mr Brown in December. In the Commons yesterday, Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, headed a concerted Labour assault, accusing the government of wanting to divert the EC money to 'keep down poll tax in Wandsworth and Westminster'. His lead was followed by a number of MPs from coal-producing regions, including Mr Derek Enright, the recently elected Labour member for Hemsworth, who said the government was 'cheating' with the money.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> The body of a woman who police believe was slain was found Wednesday in Scripps  Ranch, authorities reported.  </P> <P> The body of the unidentified woman was found 20 feet down the side of an  embankment in the 10300 block of Scripps Ranch Boulevard early Wednesday  morning.  </P> <P> At 7:30 a.m., a woman on her way to work saw a coil of yellow nylon rope near  the sidewalk and glanced over the embankment, where she saw the body, Detective  Lt. Paul Ybarrondo said.  </P> <P> Ybarrondo said the dead woman, who is possibly Latino or Asian, was in her 30s  and was wearing a dark blouse, bright green pants and white sandals.  </P> <P> There is evidence that, sometime during the night, the woman's body was dragged  from a vehicle parked at the curb, across the sidewalk and then either thrown  or taken down the embankment, Ybarrondo said. He said the rope on the sidewalk  led down to the body.  </P> <P> An autopsy has not been done.  </P> <P> The stretch of Scripps Ranch Boulevard where the woman's body was found is an  isolated industrial area not heavily traveled at night, Ybarrondo said.  </P> <P> Police have no suspects and know no motive.  </P> <P> San Diego police are handling the case, but Ybarrondo said the Metropolitan  Homicide Task Force was called to the scene.  </P> <P> Ybarrondo said Wednesday he had no reason to believe there is a connection with  this death and the series of prostitute killings over the past few years that  the task force has been investigating.  </P></p>

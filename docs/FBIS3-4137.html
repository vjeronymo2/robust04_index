			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 21 (XINHUA) -- Mammoth projects are  under construction in southwest China to convert its rich  hydropower resources into electric power for its own use and for  the energy-hungry east China.    As a result, southwest China is soon to become China's  premier hydroelectric power base, according to deputies to the  National People's Congress [NPC] now in session here who hail  from southwest China's Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou Provinces and  Guangxi Autonomous Region.    Sixty-five giant hydropower stations will form "electric  corridors" along the region's main rivers of Jinshajiang,  Yalongjiang, Daduhe, Lanchangjiang, Wujiang and Hongshuihe.  Their power will be fed to a local grid, which in turn will  transmit power to Guangdong in south China and to east China.    Southwest China has exploitable hydropower resources of 194  million kw, 572000060100f the national total.    According to Wang Zhaobang, an NPC deputy from Guangxi and a  hydropower expert, 11 power stations have been completed or are  under construction in southwest China, which will generate 51.9  billion kwh [kilowatt-hours] of electricity a year.    Another seven giant stations will be built in the area  during  the last five years of this century, he disclosed. Those  stations will have a combined generating capacity of 20 million  kw.    When all the 65 hydropower stations are completed, they will  generate 631 billion kwh of electricity a year.    One newly-completed station in Guangxi has already started  supplying power to Guangdong Province, according to He Rong, an  NPC deputy from Guangxi.    "This marks the start of implementing a state plan to  transmit power from southwest China to east China," he said.    Local electric power authorities have opened the door to  overseas investment in hydropower development. The three  provinces and one autonomous region have signed a dozen  contracts with companies from the United States, Thailand and  Hong Kong on the construction of hydropower stations and power  grids. They have also received over one billion U.S. dollars in  loans from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank,  according to the deputies.</p>

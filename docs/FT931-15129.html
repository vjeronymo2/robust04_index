			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / UK Company News: GKN to expand US production GKN, the UK motor components and industrial services group, is to build a new plant in Roxboro, North Carolina, to assemble and distribute vehicle driveline components. It is also to expand its manufacturing facilities at nearby Sanford and Alamance. In combination, the investments will increase GKN's North American production capacity for such components by 60 per cent between now and 1996. They form part of a Dollars 50m (Pounds 32.8m) expansion plan outlined last October. At the time, however, GKN was still reviewing its options on precisely how capacity should be expanded. The new facilities, to be operated by GKN's North American subsidiary, GKN Automotive, will give it capacity to build 3.3m constant velocity joint and driveshaft sets per year. Set up in 1976, GKN-AI has become the main independent North American producer of such components, supplying Ford and Chrysler as well as Japanese 'transplants' operated by Toyota, Honda and Mazda.</p>

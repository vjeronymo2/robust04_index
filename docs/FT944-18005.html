			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / World Commodities Prices: Aluminium and zinc touch highs - Market Report Base metal prices eased in late trading at the London Metal Exchange but the three months delivery ZINC price, which earlier reached a 20-month high on investment fund buying, was still up Dollars 27 a tonne at the close. Meanwhile ALUMINIUM'S continuing rally lifted it to a fresh 3 3/4 -year high of Dollars 1,645 a tonne for three months delivery at one point. The move was encouraged by another big fall in LME stocks. After falling early on COPPER prices ended about Dollars 30 a tonne up on balance. COFFEE futures rose in light volume as the Brazilian weather continued to give cause for concern.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an interview granted today to one of our  correspondents, Lieutenant General Niculae Spiroiu, Romanian  national defense minister, said that he, together with other top  officials of the ministry, had examined in Cluj the 1993 balance  of the 4th Army [the Transylvanian army], as well as aspects  related to military discipline and order in that army. They  found that the activity of the 4th Army was very well organized.    Minister Spiroiu rejected allegations published in today's  edition of the daily ULTIMUL CUVANT [THE LAST WORD] that he went  to Cluj to remove the current commander of the 4th Army, General  Paul Cheler. Spiroiu added that he regrets that such news is  being circulated without first checking with the Army Press  Office.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Aleksandr Sychev: "Moscow Considering Writing </F> Off Syrian Debts"]    [Text] "The Syrians have acknowledged their debt to Russia  and our political succession. That is major progress. The  talks will continue," according to Viktor Posuvalyuk, the  Russian president's special representative in the Near East and  member of the government delegation which has been conducting  talks in Damascus under the leadership of Oleg Soskovets, first  deputy chairman of the Russian Federation Government. The  delegation members prefer not to go into the details of the  continuing talks, but the idea of writing off part of the Syrian  debt was apparently discussed in Damascus.    The problem of the debt, which stands at approximately $10  billion, is the most acute one in our relations with Syria. A  large part of the debt results from major purchases of Soviet  weapons in the seventies and eighties.    Skokov's [as published] trip to Syria was supposed not only  to revive the frozen relations with a partner in the Near East  who was once important to the USSR. The visit was part of the  revitalized Russian policy in the region, which Moscow sees as  the second most important area after Yugoslavia in which it can  demonstrate Russia's new role in world affairs as a great power.    Russia is pretty well placed in the region. It has the  opportunity to establish qualitatively new links with old  friends. It has many former compatriots in Israel. The first  test was the request made by the Russian delegation in Damascus  to help find Israeli servicemen missing during the Israeli  invasion of Lebanon in 1982. Moscow could also be of use in the  process of the settlement of the Syrian-Israeli conflict over  the Golan Heights. captured by Israel in 1967. U.S. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher intends to pass to Damascus a  proposal on the stage-by-stage return of the occupied  territories over a period of 10 years.    Russia's growing importance in Near East affairs was  acknowledged in Moscow by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin.  Evidently, it was this that prompted him to settle for Moscow's  promise not to sell new offensive weapons to Syria, a matter  that was broached in connection with the agreement on  military-technical cooperation signed by Soskovets in Damascus.  Moscow will resume supplies of spare parts and also purely  defensive weapon systems. It is to be hoped that this treaty  will not lead to a further increase in Syria's debt to Russia,  which is facing massive financial problems.</p>

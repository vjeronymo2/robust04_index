			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / International Company News: Alcatel takes control of Turkish telecoms group ALCATEL of France has taken control of Telekomunikasyon Endustri Ticaret (Teletas) of Turkey by buying the government's 18 per cent shareholding for Dollars 20m. The purchase gives Alcatel, Europe's largest telecommunications equipment maker, 65 per cent of Teletas, Turkey's second largest telecoms producer. Teletas has a 40 per cent share of the Turkish market in big digital switches, and is the only transmission equipment maker in Turkey. The company has recently established joint ventures to supply public exchanges in Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan. In 1984 Alcatel bought 39 per cent of the company from PTT, the state post and telecommunications monopoly. Last month, it acquired 8 per cent from Teletas minority shareholders, the construction company STFA, and Ray Insurance. The decision to buy a controlling stake reflects Alcatel's strategy of expanding its position in the region. For the Turkish government, the deal marks a further government withdrawal from the telecommunications sector. Separately, the cabinet has approved legal changes to PTT ahead of the creation of a separate telecoms group. A planned global share offering of 15 per cent of this company could raise up to Dollars 2bn. The postal company will retain up to 49 per cent of the new telecom concern. The government is understood to be considering a regionalisation of the PTT units before selling them.</p>

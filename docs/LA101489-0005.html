			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR MISTAKE IN ARGENTINA  </P> <P> Argentina's President Carlos Saul Menem made a mistake this past weekend when  he issued a blanket pardon for the military men and political terrorists  responsible for most of that country's recent political turmoil. The move also  gambles that democracy has deep enough roots that Argentines can resist if  their military leaders decide to take over the government again.  </P> <P> The move was not unexpected. During the campaign that preceded his election,  Menem hinted that he might issue such pardons in an effort to "heal the wounds"  still left from one of the darkest eras of modern Argentine history -- the  terrorist campaigns waged by urban guerrillas in the 1970s which led, in turn,  to a "dirty war" by a military government determined to wipe out all traces of  subversion. Thousands of innocent people were killed in those terrible times,  most of them by the military's security apparatus.  </P> <P> More than 200 beneficiaries of Menem's forgiveness are former military  officers, including three former junta members who led Argentina to military  defeat by Great Britain in a war over the Falkland Islands. Also forgiven are  39 officers accused of human-rights violations during the dirty war, and 164  military men alleged to have taken part in armed uprisings against Menem's  predecessor, Raul Alfonsin.  </P> <P> The pardons are troubling because they weaken a legal precedent set under  Alfonsin that military leaders could be held responsible for crimes committed  during military rule. Considering the history of military juntas in Latin  America, that was an important precedent for the region.  </P> <P> Menem's decision to forgive the men who plotted against Alfonsin is especially  worrisome. They are much younger than the generals and admirals who staged the  1976 coup, oversaw the dirty war and the futile South Atlantic war. The fact  that they challenged an elected president indicates that they share attitudes  that made older offices think they could dictate Argentine policy with guns.  </P> <P> Such thinking has permeated Argentina's military caste for too long. When  Alfonsin stepped aside for Menem, it marked the first time in 60 years that one  democratically elected civilian president had succeeded another. Some of  Menem's advisers argue that he granted the pardons so that he can focus his  energies on the economic problems that are an even greater challenge for  Argentina. In some cases, that would be a practical reason for trying to excise  a divisive and emotional, but largely symbolic, political issue. But if the  dramatic economic changes Menem is trying to bring about in Argentina don't  work out as quickly or easily as his supporters hope, the pardons could work  the other way -- as invitations to the military to intervene to do things the  way the generals think they should be done. One can only hope that democracy in  Argentina has gotten strong enough in recent years that Menem's pardons will  not tempt the military to assert its influence again.  </P></p>

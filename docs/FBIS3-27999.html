The Home Affairs Ministry and the Finance Ministry will  jointly announce Saturday an outline of the program for the year  beginning next April 1. Under the program, the amount of public  works projects sponsored by local governments will increase 12  percent to 18.5 trillion yen for the fourth consecutive  double-digit rise, the sources said.    The projects are intended to help boost economic recovery.    At the same time, local government bond issues will increase  40 percent to cover revenue shortfalls in local taxes and taxes  allocated to local governments, they said. The shortfalls are  expected because of the prolonged national economic recession.</p>

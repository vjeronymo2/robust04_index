			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Renewed bond market weakness hits shares - Market Report A re-emergence of inflation worries in the US and in Britain hit securities markets in London yesterday, overshadowing the outcome of the elections for the European parliament which were not far out of line with expectations. Although selling pressure on equities was only moderate, the stock market was undermined by a new round of substantial losses in British government bonds, themselves hurt by falls in German and US bond prices. At the low point of the session, the FT-SE 100 Index was more than 45 points down and within 10 points of the 3,000 mark regained so recently and with such difficulty. A minor rally was held in check by a sluggish opening on Wall Street, where the Dow Average put on 7.45 points in UK trading hours. The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 3,016.3 for a drop on the day of 39.6. Weakness in German bonds and in other European stock markets quickly halted an attempt by UK equities to extend Friday's advance. The result of UK voting in the European elections was regarded as negative for the stock market because it implied further uncertainty for Mr John Major's government and threatened to weaken its political resolve to resist inflation. Inflation worry was also rekindled by the input pricing category of the UK domestic producer price index for May. Markets reacted swiftly to the UK Treasury comment that the 0.9 per cent increase in input prices had been 'mainly' due to oil and commodity prices. This reminded analysts that commodity price pressures had been pinpointed as inflation threats by the US Federal Reserve. Unfortunately, German bond markets began to extend early losses after a member of the US Federal Reserve Board referred to 'slight signs' of inflationary pressures in the US economy. Inflation worries focused on prospects for the US consumer price statistics, due around noon today, European time. Some strategists raised their forecasts for US CPI growth, which had previously been for a rise of around 0.3 per cent. Concern over inflationary pressure also turned attention to other components of this week's heavy list of economic data. In Britain, statistics due tomorrow on retail prices, unemployment and industrial production coincide with data on average earnings, which will be scanned for signs of wage cost pressures; tomorrow evening, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, will deliver an important speech in the City of London. However, comments yesterday afternoon from Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, on UK economic progress had little immediate impact in the stock market. The reappearance of a discount on the Footsie futures contract reinforced selling pressures on the blue chip stocks. In the broader market the FT-SE Mid 250 Index closed 12.7 off at 3,595.8. Seaq volume of 483.7m shares, although higher than on Friday, was at the low end of recent daily averages; the focus on the Footsie stocks left the non-Footsie issues to make up only about 52 per cent of the total. Friday's Seaq turnover of 416.4m shares was worth a respectable Pounds 1.26bn in retail business. The renewed focus on bond markets proved a disappointment for a UK stock market which last week showed signs of having disengaged itself from the pressures suffered by fixed interest markets since the commencement of the year.</p>

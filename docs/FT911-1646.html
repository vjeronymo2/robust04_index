			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: CS Holding Is the bad news finally out of the way at CS Holding? Zurich seems tentatively to have thought so yesterday; the shares, initially down some 2 per cent on news of a catastrophic year at CS First Boston, rallied by more than twice that, to SFr2,160, as the market mulled the refinancing plans. These are ingenious. Floating off part of Credit Suisse may or may not soften the Swiss legal mind on the subject of bank capital adequacy. But it will certainly raise money, as will the forthcoming loan issue, the equivalent of up to 25 per cent of group capital; this is obviously not true of the one-for-20 warrants for un-issued shares. Flexibility is what chairman Rainer Gut says the group will gain; it seems a mild term for a potentially large recapitalisation. With one leap Rainer was free? Only up to a point. The group will gain underlying capital strength, but properly consolidated accounts could have made the ground look still firmer, though these are very explicit figures by old Swiss standards. But the explanations are less impressive than the numbers. The group had no such exceptional Gulf exposure that CS First Boston should have entered the league of biggest loss-makers. Nor is the news that CS First Boston had a profitable first quarter persuasive given the bull market in Wall Street. What remains to be proved is that Mr Gut was right to buy out CS's former Boston partners in catastrophe, and that the group now has the talent and controls in place to avert a repetition. It may not be until we get the 1991 report that we will begin to know.</p>

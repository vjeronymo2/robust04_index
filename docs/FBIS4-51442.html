			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 26 (CNS) -- The President of the State  Mr. Jiang Zemin when attending a ceremony in which appointment  letters were conferred on the third batch of advisors on Hong  Kong affairs said that he hoped to see greater involvement of  Hong Kong people in the territory's affairs. He added that  being an advisor or a member of the Preliminary Working  Committee was considered a good pattern in participation in Hong  Kong affairs.    Mr. Jiang said that there were various kinds of  participation  in Hong Kong affairs. He called for Hong Kong people to have  greater concern for restoration of sovereignty of the territory  to China in 1997 as well as for long term prosperity and  stability which was closely related to the destiny of Hong Kong  people.    The President said that there were a mere three years left  for the reversion of Hong Kong to China and so much work was yet  to be done. The "one country, two systems" and "rule of Hong  Kong by its people" would be the very policy to be adopted by  the future Special Administrative Region government. Mr Jiang  said that the central government as well as Hong Kong people  were confident of such policies.    Mr. Jiang said that economic prosperity enjoyed by Hong Kong  people was mainly due to hard working by the territory's people.  He was convinced that Hong Kong people were not only capable of  creating a prosperous and stable Hong Kong but also capable of  maintaining such success. He went further saying that Hong Kong  people could even create a better future for the territory.    The president stressed that stability and prosperity in Hong  Kong was closely related to economic development in the mainland  which lent great support to so many economic activities  undertaken in Hong Kong. He added that the socialist mainland  would still support the territory for its stability and  prosperity after 1997.</p>

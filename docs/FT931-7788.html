			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / Cuba goes to the polls today CUBANS will vote tomorrow for national and provincial legislators for the first time since President Fidel Castro took power in 1959. The vote, described by the government as a step towards electoral reform, is unlikely to mollify Mr Castro's critics, who have been advocating multi-party elections. There will be only one candidate, officially approved by the Cuban Communist party, for each of the 589 seats in the National Assembly and 1,190 delegates to the provincial assemblies. The Cuban leader, however, has been using the event to deflect attention from the country's parlous economic condition. In several campaign speeches over the past fortnight he has described the election as an opportunity for Cubans to send a message of defiance to the US - to 'send a firm message to the enemies of the revolution, to the imperialists, that this is a united and strong people'. Although no candidates from dissident groups will be allowed to stand, the government is reported to be concerned at the possibility of a protest vote through a high number of blank ballots. Candidates receiving less than 50 per cent of the votes cast will be eliminated and new elections held for the post. Government officials say the vote is part of a programme of electoral reform which started in December with local government elections. All candidates then were also approved by the Communist party. President Castro has predicted that tomorrow's election will underline 'the triumph of the revolution'. He has said that Cuba's electoral system combines 'all the virtues of democracy without all the vices and corruption'. Cuba's economy has been under pressure since the break-up of the Soviet Union, once the island's main benefactor. A shortage of fuel has affected public transport and power generation, while the country has not been able to import sufficient food, medicines or agricultural chemicals. In recent months Cuban officials have repeatedly blamed the 32-year-old US economic embargo for the island's problems.</p>

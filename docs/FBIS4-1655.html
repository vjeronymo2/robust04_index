			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Foo Choy Peng] </F>   [Text] A bold move to unify China's antiquated foreign  exchange system into a single national interbank network from  today has sparked a controversy which threatens to escalate into  a diplomatic issue.    Banking and diplomatic sources said yesterday foreign  bankers  were confused and angry about proposed changes.    Some bankers have turned to their embassies in Beijing to  pressure Chinese authorities to clarify the changes, which they  believe will put millions of dollars of capital at risk.    The changes establish a China Foreign Exchange Trading  System  based in Shanghai, ostensibly to replace existing foreign  currency swap centres, but Beijing said this week foreign firms  must continue to use the swap centres.    Foreign companies are upset that they are kept out of the  interbank system while mainland competitors are allowed to  participate in the new network. Swap centres provide an  inefficient venue for foreign companies to offload yuan and buy  hard currencies, which are usually in short supply.    Until the end of last year, when authorities scrapped the  confusing dual currency system, China had three exchange rates  -- the swap rate of about 8.7 yuan to the U.S. dollar, the  official rate of about 5.7, and a fluctuating black market rate.    Since then, the exchange rate has been set by the country's  18 swap centres.    From today the rate will be set by the Foreign Exchange  Centre, an interbank system made up of 13 domestic banks, plus  foreign banks and financial institutions.    Of China's 100 foreign banks and financial institutions,  those wishing to join will have to deposit up to U.S.$850,000,  with no interest return, for the dubious privilege of being  allowed to sell, but not buy, foreign currencies, one banker  said.    During meetings with China's central bank, the People's Bank  of China (PBOC), foreign banks have received conflicting  messages about membership in the exchange centre.    Banking sources said at first they were told there would be  two kinds of foreign exchange banks: 13 domestic banks, which  would be allowed to buy and sell specified foreign currencies,  and foreign banks, which would be allowed to only sell the  currencies.    Before they could join the new centre, foreign banks were  told they would have to deposit $350,000 in yuan with no  interest payable and with the consequent risk of losses from  exchange rate fluctuations.    Then banks were told they would also have to transfer five  percent of their capital -- for most foreign banks about  $500,000 -- into a settlement account before they could join.  The PBOC did not say whether interest would be paid on this  deposit.    Foreign banks will be able to do business only on behalf of  exporters and will have to work through approved Chinese banks  to handle importers.    "This is banking regulation on the run and it is a  disaster,"  said one Shanghai-based Western banker.    To add to the confusion, the CHINA DAILY reported that  authorities were considering retaining the existing swap centres  to serve foreign-funded ventures.    Another Beijing-based Western banker said he and his  colleagues were totally confused and had sought clarification  from the PBOC and had asked individual embassies to help.    Yang Gonglin, from the State Administration of Exchange  Control, admitted that "some problems arose" but told the CHINA  DAILY the Government would deal with them "in time".    One Western diplomat suggested that confusion over the  banking changes, coupled with even greater confusion over  proposed tax changes, could trigger a slowdown in foreign funds.    China last year attracted the equivalent of all investments  for the past 10 years to reach $111 billion.    "There might not be a lot of business done here in the next  few months until all of this is sorted out," the diplomat said.    Hong Kong and Taiwan investors already are holding back  investments.</p>

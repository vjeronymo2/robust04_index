			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Twisting the arm of the law: Proposals set out uncompromising agenda for reforming the police PROPOSALS FOR the police that discuss the replacement of 'jobs for life' with fixed-term contracts, the introduction of performance-related pay and the abolition of three senior ranks head an uncompromising agenda for reform published yesterday. The government-appointed Sheehy inquiry into police rewards and responsibilities calls for a severance scheme costing Pounds 200m-Pounds 300m over three years to shed 5,000 middle-ranking and senior officers by voluntary or compulsory redundancy. Under the existing police structure, concludes the committee, forces have little encouragement to manage their resources. Detailed central systems of financial, staffing and managerial controls prevent 'the sensible exercise of local discretion and the introduction of change'. The committee proposes a radical array of changes designed to produce a results-driven police service that focuses on patrol constables and other frontline officers who provide the core services. A need to encourage more flexible management structures, allow for lateral as well as vertical career development, reflect individual responsibilities and 'reward good performance and penalise bad' are among the objectives which, the Sheehy committee says, determined the inquiry's approach. It says the police service has become managerially top-heavy particularly because, compared with other jobs, a unique amount of day-to-day decision-making is devolved down the line to the constable on the beat. As a result, the committee recommends the abolition of the posts of chief inspector, chief superintendent and deputy chief constable. The committee says it is not suggesting all the jobs done by present occupants of these posts are unnecessary. Police forces should decide which officers are best suited to fill posts in the new structure. Basic police pay levels should, the committee recommends, be based on the median level of private-sector non-manual pay - the upper quartile was 'rejected partly on the grounds of affordability'. This would replace a link with average industrial earnings under the existing police pay formula. Chief officers would have flexibility to adjust national increases to local requirements. Police entry salaries, the committee concludes, are now 'well above the market' - 148 per cent of the median. It proposes dropping the lowest entry salary. This would cut the starting rate for an entrant by about Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 10,630 and - combined with another proposal to abolish housing allowances for entrants - would leave a recruit substantially worse off than now. The committee says that while it does not underrate the difficulty of performance measurement in the police service, 'we cannot see how there can be a real prospect of any organisation meeting its performance targets unless those working within it have a clear view of the part they are to play'. Performance measures for individual officers play a crucial part in achieving this. Four variables should be taken into account when relating pay to responsibilities - scope of the role; particular policing circumstances such as the risk of assault in a specific job; requirements for special skills, experience and training; and individual performance related to a proposed appraisal system. Application of such factors could, for example, lead to officers being paid more if they volunteered to work on housing estates with problems of violence. Weighting of these factors, says the committee, would provide the basis for a new system of pay scales. One-off individual and team bonuses would be available. Performance should, says the committee, 'play a particularly key role in pay' at superintendent level and above. Up to 30 per cent of the pay of chief constables and assistant chief constables would be linked to performance-related bonuses. The committee recommends that new recruits should be employed on fixed-term contracts - initially for 10 years, with subsequent five-yearly renewals. Serving officers would have the opportunity to transfer to fixed-term contracts voluntarily, and would in any case do so if they transferred on promotion to a new force. Police sick pay is now unlimited. This would be replaced by a limit of six months on full pay followed by six months on half pay, subject to extension or reduction in individual cases. Many allowances would cease, while much overtime would disappear into the proposed new basis for relating pay to the demands of particular jobs. Inquiry into Police Responsibilities and Rewards.

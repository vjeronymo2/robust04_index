			<p>BFN     [Text] The draft decree on expansion of the zone of state  of emergency to the Ingush regions of Sunzhen and Malgobek is  needed for settlement of the problem with Chechnya by force,  Ingush Vice President Boris Agapov suggested. He stressed in an  interview with Interfax that such "unreasonable decrees seem to  be needed in order to lay the Russian president open to a blow."    Agapov said there was an evident attempt to create  confrontation between the president and the Federation Council  which would have to adopt the draft decree on May 31 when the  term for the state of emergency expired.    Agapov emphasized that the process of territorial division  between Chechnya and Ingushetia concerned these two regions  which were disputed areas.    The decree said that the populated centers which, as  Ingushetia had agreed, would go to the Chechen Republic of  Ichkeria, would be included in the zone of the state of  emergency, Agapov pointed out.    In the context of this situation inclusion of the Sunzhen  and  Malgobek regions into the state of emergency zone would mean a  seizure of Chechen territory. It is hard even to imagine all  consequences of such a move, Agapov underlined.    Agapov disapproved of this decision. He announced that when  he had told the interim administration about it the  administration had responded that it never knew about such  serious consequences.    Agapov suggested that such recommendations could have been  given by some politicians from the center who occupied certain  posts in the federal bodies.</p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (2): Gilts swallow funds - Investment restrictions The Charities Act 1992 was much heralded at the time. It seemed to promise a new era of investment freedom for charities restricted by the 1961 Trustee Investments Act. More than a year later, however, there is still no sign that the out-dated requirement for charities to invest most of their funds in gilts will be lifted in the near future. The Trustee Investments Act (TIA), which in its day was a liberalising measure, requires charities' investments to be split between 'wide' range vehicles, such as UK equities (but only those passing certain conditions) and UK authorised unit trusts, and 'narrow' range, which is basically UK gilts. No more than half can be in the wide range. It has been estimated that hundreds of millions of pounds of potential investment returns have been lost since 1961 because of the under-performance of gilts relative to equities. Nigel Siederer, director of the Association of Charitable Foundations (ACF), which has been lobbying for a broadening of the investment rules, says that if a charity had put half its money in gilts and half in UK shares in 1961, it would now find that it had about 85 per cent of its funds in shares, because of the comparative growth rates. The 1992 Act gave the Home Secretary the power to relax these restrictions as he saw fit. This was expected to mean a swift move to allow charities to invest a smaller portion of their funds in gilts, and more in equities, including overseas equities, which tend to perform better over the long term. But the Act also stipulated that changes were only to be made with Treasury approval. Cynics may argue that a Treasury with a large deficit to finance is unlikely to welcome a change in the law which will almost inevitably lead to a flood of gilts on to the market. Whatever the motivation, there has been no indication from the government that relaxation is imminent. The ACF has been consulting charities about what form any changes should take. Mr Siederer's view is radical: 'If possible we would like the whole notion of division of funds done away with. It seems much better to look at requiring charities to take proper advice.' As a compromise, he looks to the model of pension funds. 'Pension funds, which are in a very similar position, will tend to keep 5 to 10 per cent of their money in gilts anyway, but not very much more than that. We are actually suggesting that the division should be moved from 50/50 to 90/10, but we would rather see it done away with altogether.' It is not known exactly how many charities are restricted by the TIA, but it is thought to be about a third of the total. The TIA provisions apply only to charities whose constitutions do not specify their investment remit. Most of the larger, better known charities which may originally have been bound by the TIA, have found it worth their while to go through the procedure of asking their trustees to agree a change in their constitutions, to allow investment managers a freer rein. The TIA is not the only source of investment constraints. Many charities have a need for regular income from their investments, which can be very difficult to meet in the current investment climate, with its low interest rates. This has coincided with the tail end of the recession, with its impact on grant income and donations, to make more charities worried about the income they are earning from their funds. 'The fixed proportion of income they require is set sufficiently high to make the normal type of fund, with a high proportion in equities, inappropriate, so they need more in fixed interest type assets,' says John Harrison, of Fleming Investment Management. This is still going to be the case for many charities even if the TIA restrictions are relaxed. 'More liberalisation these days must be sensible,' says Andrew Hind of Barnados, who is also chairman of the Charity Finance Directors Group. But he adds: 'It is dangerous to think of charities as a homogenous group. There are still going to be a large number of endowed charities for whom income is the key thing. If you cannot touch the capital, there is no point in having wonderful capital growth in equities, if that is not available to you to meet your commitments.' In the period leading up to last year's crisis in the exchange rate mechanism, unconstrained charities also started to look abroad for income. 'The proportion of investment in overseas bonds has grown quite markedly over the last 18 months or so,' says Mr Harrison. 'Overseas bonds were almost unheard of in charities' portfolios two years ago, but are a fairly high proportion of the total now - about 6 per cent.' However, now that sterling is no longer so overvalued, he expects that proportion to decline. 'Sterling is where the expenses arise.' Mr Harrison sees an historic tendency for charities to shadow pension funds in their investment patterns, and for that reason he suspects that the holding of overseas equities may grow: the average pension fund is 28 per cent invested in overseas equities, whereas unconstrained charities have on average only 24 per cent in overseas equities. Mr Hind sees it in a different light. He thinks the way that the charities act has highlighted trustees' responsibilities could make them more conservative in their investment attitudes, pushing them away from overseas equities and other investments which could be seen as in the least risky. 'Trustees are likely to want to play it safe even more than they did before. Perhaps the impact will be felt in terms of the selection of fund managers,' Mr Hind suggests. Trustees could feel uneasy about justifying the use of anyone but the leading fund managers. 'I think we may see a concentration of portfolios into the big five or 10, in a way that we have not seen before.' One result of the 1992 Act which is already becoming visible is the winding down of the office of the Official Custodian, whose role was to administer the investments of thousands of charities, dealing with day to day dividend payments and so on.</p>

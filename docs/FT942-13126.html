			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (21): The golden age is yet to dawn - Software Engineering Software builders have tried to apply engineering disciplines to software production for more than a quarter of a century with the hope that one day software can be produced as easily as automobiles. But only recently - with the advent of new techniques such as object-oriented design - has some progress has been made outside a few specialist areas. Software for use in 'life-or-death' applications such as aerospace and defence has made most use of the engineering approach using standard components and production engineering processes. The large development budgets available to build these systems make it possible to use expensive procedures to control the design and development of software. Such development methods emphasise meticulous early design, tight project control and the use of tried and tested 'components'. Commercial software production - with its tighter delivery schedules and limited budgets - has not, so far, been able to take much advantage of engineering techniques. Despite attempts to introduce computer-aided software engineering (CASE) development methods, commercial software production remains more a craft than an engineering discipline. This looks set to change in the next few years. The main drive towards the engineering approach has come from object-oriented computing, which is now widely accepted as the most important future direction for software design. The use of standard 'parts' or 'components' is a key concept in object-oriented design. In the same way that a motor car manufacturer buys in parts such as gear boxes and engines, the object-oriented software developer builds systems from proven software components. Most software tool developers are using object-oriented (O-O) techniques to reinforce the engineering approach: 'Object-oriented computing is now showing promise because it can deal with repeatable development processes. It has reached a level of maturity where components can be re-used and, slowly, the dream of software engineering is being realised,' says Mr Don Kavanagh, European consultancy manager from software tool developer Interactive Data Environments (IDE). 'But it goes well beyond simple code re-use. Objects let you re-use high-level concepts too. You can build high-level enterprise objects which are like engineering blueprints.' He adds that applications of the future will be built like Lego models - which will make it easier for non-programmers to engineer their own applications from kits of parts. This has profound implications for the software industry - 'the structure of the software industry is changing in a way which poses a threat to traditional assembly line programming,' says Mr Dave Thomas, founder and chief executive of Object Technology International, which specialises in O-O software tools - 'we are seeing a move to creating high-level user objects which are business specific. Banks like Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse are building object-oriented financial options 'components' which they could publish for general use,' says Mr Thomas. This trend has been highlighted recently with the foundation of the Business Object Management Special Interest Group (Bomsig), which aims to create applications objects for specific industries. There are certain processes which all companies in an industrial sector use. In the past, they have each developed their own expensive software to deal with such issues as industry standards and government legislation. Bomsig participants hope to create standard 'parts' appropriate to particular industries which all companies can license. NO EASY ANSWERS But this will not be without its problems. Dr Robert Rockwell, chief technology adviser at German software engineering specialist Softlab suggests that the origins of O-O design place a question mark over the long term success of the engineering approach: 'The concept of engineering software is one of the Holy Grails of the software industry. But there is a large class of software which can't be produced in this way,' he says. 'Engineering is about standard parts and standard procedures. Objects certainly give you standard parts - but their background runs counter to standard procedures.' Dr Rockwell says object technology comes from institutions with flat hierarchies with no bosses and no standard procedures - such as universities and research laboratories. This puts it in direct conflict with the traditional business approaches to building software - where procedures are imposed from the top. The main problem with software is, of course, that it is unlike any other human artefact. Analogies with other production processes while useful are, therefore, bound to be inadequate. This makes software production hard to define formally and, ultimately, difficult to 'engineer.' There is no doubt that the object-oriented approach is a step forward. It will help to reinforce a more disciplined approach to creating applications software through use of tried-and-tested components. Whether it will lead to a golden age of genuine software engineering, however, remains unclear.</p>

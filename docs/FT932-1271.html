			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Norweb warns of a 'dividend race' NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, yesterday criticised other power companies for starting what it called a dividend race. Mr Ken Harvey, Norweb chairman, warned that the increases would attract the attention of Offer, the industry regulator. The company outlined its stance as it unveiled a 13 per cent dividend increase for 1992, the smallest rise granted by a regional electricity company this results season, but way above the stock market average and more than Norweb wanted to pay. High dividend rises in the sector - 14 per cent at East Midlands, 15 per cent at Manweb and South Wales Electricity - have fuelled the political debate over whether the privatised companies make excessive profits. Previously Norweb had one of the most bullish dividends policies, saying it expected to make annual increases of 6 to 8 per cent in real terms for the rest of the decade. However, Mr Harvey said: 'We have moved close to the pack because it would have harmed the company otherwise. 'Every company reporting so far has claimed there is no dividend race but it is difficult to come to any other conclusion. The regulator cannot just stand aside and watch if companies pay rises of above 16 per cent as they may yet do.' Professor Stephen Littlechild, Offer director general, is likely to tell the regional companies the results of his supply review shortly after the last of them reports on July 6. Results, Page 23</p>

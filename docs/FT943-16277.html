			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / International Company News: BHP eyes potential in power generation Mr John Prescott, chief exec-utive of Broken Hill Proprietary, said yesterday that the large Australian steel and resources group had the financial strength to undertake a large acquisition should a suitable opportunity arise. At the the company's annual presentation, following the release of year-end results on Friday, analysts were also told that BHP was anxious to avoid seeing gearing drop to a point where it had 'a lazy balance sheet'. BHP gave no firm indications of what deals it might entertain, but a number of executives - including Mr Prescott - stressed the potential which the group saw in the power generation business, especially in Asia and South America, and in the continued diversification of both its minerals and petroleum divisions. Mr Jerry Ellis, executive general manager of the BHP minerals unit, said later that the former division was aiming to double profit by the year 2000. Mr Prescott also stressed again that BHP planned to hold its minority stake in Foster's Brewing Company, the Australian brewery group which owns Courage in the UK, for the long-term. Star Mining, the Australian exploration company, plans to contribute a further USDollars 5m to the 'charter capital' of Lenzoloto, the state-controlled Siberian gold mining company with which it hopes jointly to develop the large Sukhoi Log gold project. The additional investment follows written confirmation from GKI, the Russian government agency, that a decree has been drawn up resolving the future structure of Lenzoloto. Star will be the joint stock company's foreign investor, with a one-third stake. The Irkutsk government and the Russian ministry of atomic energy will also become shareholders. Star's ultimate plan is to raise Lenzoloto's annual gold production from 350,000 ounces at present, to around 2m ounces in six years. The Australian-listed company is expected to arrange for injection of around USDollars 250m in order to achieve this.</p>

			<p>940304 FT  04 MAR 94 / Philips jumps back in black Philips, the Dutch electronics group, swung firmly into the black last year, allowing the company to pay its first dividend since an extensive restructuring was set in motion in 1990. Net profits excluding extraordinary items totalled Fl 856m (Pounds 297.20m), reversing the previous year's net loss of Fl 900m. Extraordinary gains of Fl 1.11bn, including a big profit on the sale of shares in a Japanese joint venture, boosted total net profit to Fl 1.97bn. The sharp turnaround was due mainly to cost-cutting and to a strong reduction in financing charges, rather than to any vigorous improvement in market conditions. Philips said sales grew in North America and Asia but fell in Europe. Overall, turnover rose by 1 per cent to Fl 58.8bn. The figures were at the top end of analysts' expectations, and Philips' shares closed yesterday nearly 9 per cent higher at Fl 50. Commenting on the dividend of Fl 0.50, Mr Jan Timmer, president, said: 'We hope the worst of the problems are behind us, that we have cautiously started on the road to recovery, and that we will again be able to pay a dividend for 1994.' Philips is cautious about how much improvement it will achieve this year. Pressure on margins is expected to continue. Mr Timmer said that most divisions either matched or improved on their results in spite of the difficult economic conditions in Europe. The biggest exception was the communications systems division, which produced a loss because of reduced demand in Germany, its main market. This caused overall operating profit in the professional products sector to decline sharply to Fl 177m from Fl 663m. Philips' single biggest business, consumer electronics, saw the first signs of recovery, with operating losses narrowing to just Fl 73m from Fl 553m. The sector would have returned to the black last year if it had not been for continued heavy losses at the German affiliate Grundig. Philips also announced that Mr Floris Maljers, who will retire in May as chairman of Unilever NV, would succeed Mr Wisse Dekker as chairman of its Philips' supervisory board.

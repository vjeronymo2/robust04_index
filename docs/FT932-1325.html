			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: Per Astra ad pyrotechnic auditing Ardua / A look at a probe related to arms for Iraq with explosive implications for the profession The weighty tome published last week about the investigation by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors into Astra Holdings, the munitions group, makes explosive reading for the accountancy profession. While many will be frustrated at the absence of commentary on the sensational allegations linking the company to the British intelligence services and the provision of arms to Iraq, the 550-page text is sober reading for accountants. Though couched in careful words, it is a depressing catalogue of the worst excesses of 'creative accounting' in the 1980s. It also raises questions about how far auditors and their firms serve directors at the expense of shareholders. In 1981, Astra Fireworks, a modest-sized firework manufacturer and distributor, was bought by a management team and began diversifying into military pyrotechnics. The team became the directors, and their advisers - solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett and accountants Stoy Hayward - remained with them over the following years. The company had a private placing of shares in 1985 and, as a result of a reverse take-over of Sumner, it circumvented the requirements of the Unlisted Securities Market to obtain a full listing in 1986, renaming itself Astra Group in the process. A meteoric rise in its performance then began, fuelled by acquisitions. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 24,000 in 1984. They rose to Pounds 103,000 the next year, Pounds 340,000 in 1986, Pounds 1m in 1987 and Pounds 6m in 1988. By 1989, it had become a Pounds 200m turnover company with Pounds 80m in net assets and Pounds 9.5m in profits. Between 1986 and 1989 Astra bought seven companies, leaving little time for consolidation between each. 'The ink was hardly dry on one acquisition before the board diverted their attention to another,' say the DTI inspectors. The purchases cost Pounds 115m, generated through Pounds 91.7m in cash from shareholders, and borrowings of Pounds 53m. It could not last. In September 1989, Astra bought PRB, a Belgian munitions company, which 'proved to be a disaster'. The investment was a complete write-off, generating losses in 1990 of Pounds 65.2m. The company limped on until receivers were appointed in February last year. Secured creditors have received 66p in the pound. Others are unlikely to receive anything. After the DTI investigators began work in August 1990, their remit was rapidly extended from the acquisition of PRB to a wide range of accounting issues in earlier years. What emerges is a company determined to maintain a strong profits record through hasty acquisitions and liberal accounting, at the expense of consistency and fair disclosure to shareholders. In 1986, Astra discovered an accounting error which would have led to a profits shortfall sufficient to jeopardise its flotation. As a result, the DTI inspectors conclude, a false invoice for Pounds 240,000 was raised against Astra through an offshore company, Export Marketing International of Guernsey, controlled by the group, and paid for by two directors through a Swiss bank. They do not criticise Stoy Hayward for failing to detect the false invoice. But they highlight the failure to compare in detail two inconsistent lists of sales prepared by the company; and lack of documentation to check that the amounts invoiced had been included in turnover. A second issue concerned the acquisition by Astra of Richard Unwin International in time to include it in the 1987 accounts most favourably. It was effected through what the inspectors call 'a manifestly artificial scheme'. Astra was keen to include a Pounds 729,000 contract with Unwin from the Nigerian Ministry of Defence dating from July 1985. By using merger accounting, Astra would be able to include the profits - including the contract - for the entire year, regardless of how much had been earned after the purchase. A report from Stoy argued that Unwin was nearly insolvent and only showed positive assets by revaluing its site and including sales prior to their despatch. It also questioned how far the Nigerian contract was recoverable. None the less, Stoy suggested a different approach, known as 'the Ashdown scheme'. Unwin's owner would sell his shares to Ashdown Investments, an Isle of Man company, which would then be bought by Astra. The structure of the deal permitted Astra to bring in the profit on the Nigerian contract while excluding the losses of the past. In 1986 Astra also bought MFA International, which proved a severe drain on cash. To avoid showing its losses in the group accounts, Stoy helped devise a way to keep it controlled by the company but off-balance and hence not consolidated in the accounts. The vehicle was Doveshrewd, devised with four classes of shares and two independent shareholders simply, according to a lawyer's note at the time, 'so that it did not really look like a sham  ... one may as well keep it as much at arms length as one could]' Over three years, the directors made interest-free loans totalling Pounds 4m to MFA which were never disclosed in the accounts. The Stoy auditors accepted minutes of a Doveshrewd meeting as evidence that the company could be treated as off-balance sheet, and assurances from the directors that the loans would be repaid so that no provisions were required. No such repayments took place. MFA was finally consolidated in 1989, and Astra happily used acquisition accounting, which meant previous losses would not be consolidated. The goodwill on purchase of the company through Doveshrewd was written off through reserves and not separately disclosed, but instead subsumed with large write-offs from the acquisition of BMARC. The BMARC purchase itself was also an ideal candidate for acquisition accounting. This allowed for the creation of enormous fair value provisions, which were then released from reserves to contribute 40 per cent to profits in 1989 alone. There was a provision of Pounds 7.2m 'established as at date of acquisition' for the 5 months before purchase in May 1988. The figure was not considered or calculated until June 1989. It included write-offs for all munitions for which there were no orders in hand at the time of purchase, even though substantial new orders were known of by that time. Accounting on other issues was equally opaque. In 1987, for instance, all of the remuneration of four directors was deferred and capitalised. Astra argued that this was legitimate because their time had been spent on acquisitions. The inspectors disagree. In 1988, a note that 83 per cent of turnover was from the US was the only indication that two acquisitions - Walters and Kilgore - were the only profitable parts of the group. The directors report argued greater disclosure 'would be prejudicial to the interests of the group'  - an argument accepted by Stoy for which the firm is criticised by the inspectors. Stoy rejects the criticisms made by the DTI inspectors and argues that the points raised are interpretational or judgemental. The DTI is considering whether to begin disqualification proceedings against the company's directors. The relevant legal, accounting and securities disciplinary bodies are also mulling possible action. The Accounting Standards Board has proposals for reducing flexibility in acquisition provisions and merger accounting. The rules on off-balance sheet vehicles have been tightened. But the relationship between accountancy firms and directors remains relatively unquestioned. And how many other companies given the same degree of scrutiny for their accounting during the 1980s would emerge uncriticised?</p>

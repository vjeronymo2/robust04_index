			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Khamrayev report under the "Revelations" rubric: </F> "Grigoriy Yavlinskiy Analyzes Reforms Failures. In His Opinion,  `Further Reforms Are Only Possible From Below' in Russia"]    [Text] Grigoriy Yavlinskiy gives Russia another three to  four years to make the final choice: Either it is a civil  society working for its own benefit in an economy suited for it,  or it is a "super-monopolized economy serving only a mafia-like  government." Today, the leader of the "Yabloko" Duma faction  stated at a meeting with students and teachers of Moscow State  University, "The threat of the second option is great."    Mr. Yavlinskiy sees the reasons for that in our "most unique  system formed over the recent 80 years" -- it has manifested a  "staggering capacity for reproduction." The uniqueness of this  system, according to Yavlinskiy, lies in that it was conceived  as a super-monopoly and "was supposed to work without money,  whereby it placed itself outside the law and therefore was  sustained by connections, injunctions, and intimidation." "We  have made the main error," the author of the "500-Days" concept  went on to analyze the reform effort, "by freeing this  essentially mafia-like system, whereas it was society that had  to be freed from it."    The possibilities of "reforms from the top," Mr. Yavlinskiy  pledged, have become limited to "a feeble liberalization of  prices and decentralization of their control." In unison with  the voucher privatization liked "only by those who got their  checks for free," these measures have helped the old system take  on a new form. Now it "is seeking to strike its own internal  balance," in order to preserve unaltered the new situation,  "unique in world experience," which provides a material and  technical base for the mafia's final accession to power. "I did  not realize this at once," admitted Mr. Yavlinskiy, "but if  neither the president nor the government do not think it  necessary to talk about a program of further reforms, only one  conclusion suggests itself: No programs are needed, all reforms  have already been carried through."    Further reforms, in the view of "Yabloko's" creator, are  possible only "from below." To enable them, Russia would need,  for the next five to seven years, "a professional, competent,  not self-centered government which, having sensed the needs of  society, would stop interfering in its work." The financial  support for the new stage of reforms, Mr. Yavlinskiy thinks, can  only be the dollars that Russian businessmen have transferred  abroad: "Conditions should be created so that businessmen would  start bringing back their accumulations with no fear or  misgiving."    Grigoriy Yavlinskiy spoke against early presidential  elections and vouched that he would run for the presidency only  if there are going to be "lawful elections rather than  mafia-like shoot-outs."</p>

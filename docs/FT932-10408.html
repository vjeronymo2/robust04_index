			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Society calls for merger MEMBERS of the Warwick-based Heart of England building society, the UK's 25th biggest, are being called upon by their board to vote next month for a proposed take-over by Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the sixth largest. Heart of England has been looking for a suitable partner after negotiations with the Bank of Edinburgh fell through earlier this year. Heart of England is just one of the smaller building societies that has found it increasingly difficult to compete in a numerically well-served industry. Although it has not been losing money, its pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.6m (after bad debt provisions of Pounds 12.3m) for the year to end-February were down on last year's pre-tax surplus of Pounds 2.3m. Heart of England has 230,000 savers and 30,000 borrowers. In buoyant times, members of a smaller society taken over by a larger one could look forward to a bonus as compensation for transferring their ownership to another society. Most importantly, though, a bonus is a payment arising from equalising the level of the reserves between the two societies. But, in this case, Heart of England's general reserve ratio, at 4.22 per cent, is lower than C&amp;G's 4.54. So, C&amp;G says there are no 'excess' reserves to be distributed as a bonus. Instead, it is offering sweeteners to persuade Heart of England members to stay put under the new management. One such is a guarantee to pay 0.25 of a percentage point above Heart of England's rates on accounts which are open to new investors for one year after the merger. Heart of England customers will find, however, that interest rates at C&amp;G generally are higher than they are getting now. The exceptions are their Instant Gold and Tessa accounts. The former pays 5.15 per cent gross on its top tier of Pounds 25,000 compared with 4.3 per cent gross on C&amp;G's Cheltenham Gold account. The Tessa pays 7 per cent compared with C&amp;G's top Tessa rate of 6.85 per cent. If the merger is agreed, it is expected to go through on October 1.</p>

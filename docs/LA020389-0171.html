			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> 4 TOP KIDDER EXECUTIVES RESIGN  </P> <P> Four top executives at General Electric Co.'s Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. have  resigned in what one described as a "difference of opinion regarding the firm's  future," according to published reports today.  </P> <P> The resignations occurred less than two weeks after General Electric put the  head of its own investment banking unit in charge of Kidder's profitable  division.  </P> <P> Michael D. Madden, head of investment banking and the highest-ranking Kidder  veteran, was among those who submitted his resignation Thursday, according to  today's editions of the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times.  </P> <P> Madden and other sources told the newspapers that other Kidder executives were  also considering resigning and that the firm was paralyzed over concerns about  the firm's future, the newspapers said.  </P> <P> Kidder Chairman Silas S. Cathcart was quoted as saying the situation was not so  serious.  </P> <P> "We're going to miss a few people, but life will go on," the Journal quoted  Cathcart as saying. He also added that GE and Kidder are developing a new  business strategy and that "it's a good plan and everybody agrees with it."  </P></p>

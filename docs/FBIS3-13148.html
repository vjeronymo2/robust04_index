Pakistan has also been included in the framework of  regional cooperation and to that extent it appears that closer  ties with India are not being sought at the expense of its close  ties with this country. However, there are clear indications  that the regional scenario is changing, Iran, for instance, has  signed a number of agreements of considerable economic  significance with India. Given the primacy of economic interest  and Iran's relative isolation in the international community,  such ties are likely to supersede most other considerations. It  is significant also that on the eve of the vote in the Human  Rights Commission on the issue of human rights violations in  Kashmir the Iranian foreign minister seems to have endorsed the  Indian position favoring a resolution through bilateral  negotiations between India and Pakistan. The new alignments  taking shape in the region would suggest that the potential of  Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO), now emerging as a major  regional economic arrangement, has been reduced. As for our  close ties with China, again it would be useful to keep in mind  the recent thaw in Sino-Indian relations whereby the two  countries have agreed to reduce tensions with regard to their  border dispute. In the aftermath of the break-up of the Soviet  Union, India's ally and China's adversary, India and China  clearly appear to be moving towards a relationship very  different from the one they have had for approximately three  decades. Apart from the economic ties that are developing  between the three states, a common concern is that of resisting  pressure from the United States which Iran, China and India,  have felt in unsettling, albeit different, ways. This has been  translated into a call for minimising external interference in  the region and the internal affairs of states. Pakistan itself  subject to a US aid cut-off as a result of differences on the  nuclear issue may well appreciate the sentiment but will have to  be guided also by the prevailing situation on the ground  especially vis-a-vis India.    In any case Pakistan should be realistic and take due  cognizance of changes taking place in the region. It has to  accept that sovereign states are free to choose their allies or  friends in accordance with their perceived and changing  interests. Undue sentimentality in this context has caught us  unawares in the past and adversely affected our ability to  adjust in time to changed circumstances. If the new regional  order entails closer ties between China and Iran on the one hand  and our major adversary India on the other, then so be it. We  may still be in a position to use our relationship with the  former to influence the latter in some ways with regard to  working towards an acceptable resolution of key outstanding  issues such as Kashmir and nuclear non-proliferation in the  region. In any case, while not compromising on our basic  national interests and keeping these in view maintaining  friendly relations with different countries, it is important to  ensure that the on-going developments do not eventually lead to  a distancing from longstanding friends in the region.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Single mothers on increase in Wales More than a third of births in Wales are to unmarried women, a rate which has tripled in a decade, official figures showed yesterday. The latest edition of Welsh Social Trends says that 340 of every 1,000 births were outside marriage in 1992 compared with 312 in England and Wales as a whole. The rate is nearly nine times higher than it was 40 years ago. Nearly half of all households in Wales were headed in 1992 by someone who was economically inactive or unemployed. In 1991 average earnings for full-time male workers were only 87 per cent of the British figure. The report shows migration was the most important factor in population change, overshadowing natural change. In recent years, most Welsh counties have had net inflows of people and by 2011 the population is expected to rise by 124,000 to 3.01m. The number of people who speak Welsh has risen slightly since 1981, although there were far fewer than before the second world war. In 1991 more than 500,000 people in the principality spoke Welsh, with the proportion of children who were either fluent or could speak a 'fair amount' higher than in the population as a whole.

During the trial, which was open to accredited foreign  diplomats and reporters, it was proven that Gonzalez Gonzalez  disseminated fictitious reports of large-scale attacks on public  centers and police repression to the United States by telephone,  which were broadcast by anti-Cuban radio stations.    [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 0033 GMT on 16 April transmits a  related 300-word Havana-datelined report on the Rodolfo Gonzalez  Gonzalez case. The EFE report says Gonzalez, who is identified  as the spokesman for the outlawed Cuban Human Rights Committee,  was convicted of disseminating "enemy propaganda," a crime for  which he received "one of the harshest sentences handed down  over the past few years for a political crime." Gonzalez is  quoted as saying he does not expect to serve his entire  sentence, "because the current situation in Cuba cannot last  that long."]</p>

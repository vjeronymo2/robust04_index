			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Cairo, 18 Apr -- In a press statement published  here today, Kuwaiti Ambassador to Egypt 'Abd-al-Hamid  al-Bu'ayjan, said the way to resolve the pending problems is for  Iraq to abide by all UN Secretary Council resolutions and the  resolutions of the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border demarcation committee.    Ambassador al-Bu'ayjan called on the Iraqi regime to deal  with the case of Kuwaiti POW's case and missing persons through  the Red Cross and to allow the latter to send a mission to visit  Iraqi jails and detention centers. [passage omitted]    The ambassador pointed out that the Iraqi statements do not  add anything new. In the past, the Iraqi regime also revoked  the decision to annex Kuwait until a cease-fire is reached, but  it then presented a memorandum to the UN Security Council,  saying that revoking the annexation decision was taken under the  then prevailing conditions and began to repeat the same story  about the 19th governorate in its media and political  publications.    Replying to a question on the suggestion that a Kuwaiti  parliamentarian delegation be sent or that some figures should  shuttle between Baghdad and Kuwait, Ambassador al-Bu'ayjan said  Arab League Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid has  exerted great efforts in this respect and that such trips would  be useless without a recognition of international resolutions.</p>

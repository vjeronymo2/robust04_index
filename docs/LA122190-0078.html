			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STYLE: CONVEYING THE HOLIDAY SPIRIT WITH GAY APPAREL;  </P> <P> DRESSING FOR OCCASION: MUSICAL TIES, LIGHTED SOCKS ARE AVAILABLE  </P> <P> Don we now our gay apparel: our socks that light up like Christmas trees, our  musical neckties that play "Jingle Bells," our boxer shorts festooned with  reindeer.  </P> <P> This season everybody's getting decked out for the holidays. Young or old, male  or female, people are dressing from head to toe in Yuletide attire.  </P> <P> Even stuffy executives have succumbed to the holiday spirit. The Tie Rack in  MainPlace, Santa Ana, had one customer swear off musical ties after his started  playing Christmas carols during an annual meeting with 800 other executives.  </P> <P> "He was sitting in the front row and he couldn't get the thing to shut off,"  says Ziva Adams, manager of the Tie Rack. "They tried dunking the tie in a  glass of water but that only made it play louder."  </P> <P> With each passing Christmas, the amount of seasonal garb has grown.  </P> <P> At Nordstrom, men can choose from braces adorned with angels and Christmas  trees, ties with Victorian scenes of old St. Nick, and socks with skiing Santas  and reindeer.  </P> <P> Some of these novelties do not come cheap -- the suspenders cost $110 and the  hand-sewn silk ties about $35. Yet shoppers merrily snap them up.  </P> <P> "They're fun and they can be worn year after year," says Lenora Giovino,  wardrobe consultant for Nordstrom in MainPlace. "Men are just going crazy over  this stuff."  </P> <P> Some bosses wear festive garments to show their employees they're more like  Santa Claus than Scrooge.  </P> <P> One Nordstrom customer, a company vice president, showed up at his office  wearing red corduroy pants covered with green Christmas trees, a shirt with  bright candy cane stripes, suspenders and Santa socks.  </P> <P> "He blew his staff away," Giovino says. "He's a very strait-laced guy."  </P> <P> Giovino's husband has worn his holiday suspenders to two Christmas galas this  year.  </P> <P> "He's been the hit of the party," she says.  </P> <P> Dressing up like elves is a way for people to spread holiday cheer. Yet behind  the frivolity lies a serious desire on the part of many to find relief from a  world they might find hard or threatening, Giovino says.  </P> <P> "This isn't threatening," she says. "The world is such a hard place. This  cheers people up."  </P> <P> Nordstrom also has battery-operated socks and mittens with light bulbs that  actually work and colorful hand-knit sweaters for women trimmed with Christmas  trees, snowmen, reindeer, bows and wreaths.  </P> <P> "This will be fun to wear to a party," says Beth Southern of Villa Park, a  young woman admiring one of the holiday cardigans. "It's different from your  ordinary red sweater or green turtleneck. And it's always in style."  </P> <P> Technology has added to the variety of novelty merchandise.  </P> <P> The Sock Market in MainPlace has an array of socks adorned with wreaths, Santas  and candy canes that light up and play Christmas carols, thanks to tiny  batteries and microchips.  </P> <P> Computer-generated patterns allow sock and sweater manufacturers to weave  intricate holiday designs into their garments. Oshkosh has tiny stockings for  infants and children decorated with detailed pictures of trains, toy soldiers  and Christmas mice for $4.75.  </P> <P> "Today it's all done on computer, whereas years ago they used to have to do it  by hand," says Connie Gualiano, manager of The Sock Market. Where handmade  socks would cost about $35, machine-made ones sell for about $3 to $15.  </P> <P> Thanks to colorful graphics, socks are no longer utilitarian but a key fashion  accessory.  </P> <P> "Customers constantly call us before the holidays to see if we have our  Christmas hosiery in," Gualiano says.  </P> <P> Men who never strayed from black, brown or navy socks will now sport red and  green stockings with bells and lights.  </P> <P> For conservative Kris Kringles there are more restrained holiday styles, such  as black socks with just a sprig of holly along the sides or gray socks with a  single black-and-white-striped Christmas ornament.  </P> <P> Men and women are buying boxer shorts adorned with Christmas mice, polar bears  and hippo Santas for $12.99 at the Tie Rack. Young women wear them on the  outside, while Adams has sold them to businessmen to wear underneath their  suits.  </P> <P> The Tie Rack also stocks tuneful ties that play "Jingle Bells" and sell for  $15.99. This season's most popular style shows Santa lounging in a hammock  under a palm tree.  </P> <P> "It's an excuse to be silly," Adams says.  </P> <P> Kiosks stationed throughout Fashion Island in Newport Beach stock unusual  seasonal merchandise.  </P> <P> For baby, there are rompers, tennis shoes, sweat shirts and hair bows  hand-painted with Christmas themes.  </P> <P> Jamaica Me Crazy carries rubber bolos featuring Christmas cacti and Santas,  with coordinating earrings and bracelets.  </P> <P> The Sporting Life, a women's boutique in Fashion Island, has earrings strewn  with miniature Christmas lights, necklaces strung with jingle bells and red  chili peppers, red and green metallic shoelaces and Christmas sweaters with  snowmen, trees or sequined ornaments.  </P> <P> "We do really well with our novelty. People want to wear something frivolous,"  says Linda Recko, manager of the Sporting Life.  </P> <P> "People's happiest memories are of the holidays. They're trying to recapture  those simpler, childish times."  </P></p>

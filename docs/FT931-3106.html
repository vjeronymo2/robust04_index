			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Clarke to meet fire unions today LEADERS OF the Fire Brigades Union are due to meet Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, this morning to discuss the future of the pay formula that has decided the wages of their 49,000 members for 14 years. Under the formula drawn up by the last Labour government to end the first national firefighters' strike, their pay is linked to the upper quartile of all male manual workers' earnings. Last November the firemen secured a 4.9 per cent pay rise as a result of wage comparability, but their union fears the government intends to scrap the pay formula. Fire officers receive between Pounds 12,720 and Pounds 16,626 a year. 'The formula has kept industrial peace for 14 years,' Mr Ken Cameron, the FBU's general secretary, said yesterday. He added that the union would warn Mr Clarke that he faced the threat of another national strike if the pay formula was scrapped. The pay formula has been suspended since last November under the government's current 1.5 per cent public-sector pay limit. Mr Cameron says the formula has already 'been unilaterally ditched' as a result of the government's public-sector incomes policy.</p>

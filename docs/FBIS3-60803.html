Major General Mahmud Wajdi, director of the Cairo  Investigation Administration, has stated that the elements were  arrested as part of the campaigns ordered by Interior Minister  Hasan al-Alfi to root out any activity emanating from the slums  to disrupt public order. He added that during these campaigns,  two workshops for manufacturing weapons in the al-Sharrabiyah  and Shubra al-Khaymah Districts of Cairo had been uncovered  where 19 firearms and 150 types of weapons--including knives,  metal bars, and daggers--were found.

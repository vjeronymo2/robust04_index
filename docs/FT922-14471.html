			<p>920407 FT  07 APR 92 / Survey of The Computer Industry (1): As profits slide, nobody is laughing now - After irrevocable changes, the troubled computer industry is peering into the unknown THE POWER of the word 'dramatic' to describe change in the global computer industry has been dissipated by over-use. Few words, however, more accurately describe either the series of body blows the industry has endured since the end of the 1980s, or the responses of the larger players to market conditions which have often seemed out of their control. Rock bottom may have been reached last year. The most telling statistic reverberated around the industry, sending shivers down the spines of its senior executives: the combined half year figures for the world's 10 largest information technology suppliers showed a 10 percentage point fall in sales, while net income as a percentage of sales was down six points. Over the year as a whole, the industry's largest player, International Business Machines, a company accustomed to believing it owns the data processing business, lost money for the first time. Revenues slipped by 6 per cent to Dollars 64.8bn, while the company made a pretax loss of Dollars 2.9bn. The weariness which Mr John Akers, IBM chairman, must be feeling oozed into his report to shareholders: 'The product transition of our higher-margin, large computer business was slower than expected; we did not see the returns we anticipated from our investments in marketing resources and we continued to experience severe pricing pressures, especially in our storage systems, personal computer, printer and display businesses.' Mr Hans-Dieter Wiedig, president and chief executive of the German computer manufacturer, Siemens Nixdorf Information Systems, expresses some of the bewilderment the industry is experiencing: 'Nobody could have anticipated that the leading ten companies of the industry would have losses and reduced sales. If you had made that prediction two years ago, it would have been regarded as a joke.' Today, nobody is laughing. Instead, there is a growing realisation that the industry has changed irrevocably and that the survivors will be those companies able to adapt to the new conditions. It is becoming accepted that the buoyant demand for information technology equipment which fuelled industry growth rates of 20 per cent a year or more during the 1980s will not return. Instead, the computer business will have to obey the rules of more mature industries. In particular, smaller computers - personal computers, workstations and network servers - are beginning to sell for prices more typical of commodity items than sophisticated products. The computer business is beginning to share many of the attributes of commodity markets - gross profit margins are narrowing, product differentiation is becoming difficult, volume sales and effective distribution are becoming essential to profitability. Gross margins of 60 per cent or more have become 20- 30 per cent or less. The reasons for the industry's plight are several and complex. First, there is the ever-accelerating pace of technological change. The availability of low-cost computing power in the form of high performance microprocessor chips is reducing barriers to entry to the industry by reducing the need for heavy expenditure on research and development. It has become a comparatively simple task to combine an Intel microprocessor and Microsoft MS/DOS operating software to create a cheap personal computer. A consequence has been price competition forcing down the cost of personal systems by anything from 25 per cent to 40 per cent a year. The problem for manufacturers is first, to secure effective distribution for their products. Second, to differentiate their systems from their competitors. Compaq, a leader in high performance personal computers, has discovered to its cost that an established brand name counts for less today than in previous years. It established a quality image and charged appropriate prices. Too late, it realised its was overpriced in a market that cared more about cost than quality. Its strategy for recovery includes the development of lower priced machines which maintain Compaq's traditional quality, while selling through a variety of outlets, including the new industry phenomenon, computer superstores. Second, the move to 'open systems' among customers is gathering pace. Open systems implies industry-wide standards. It implies computers built of standard microchips running standard operating systems. It implies the ability easily to connect systems from different manufacturers. The best example of an open operating system is Microsoft's MS/DOS, used on the majority of personal computers world wide. Unix, a system originally designed in AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories, may yet become the industry standard despite shortcomings in security and ease of use. Originally designed for engineering workstations, it has been adapted for use on every size of machine from supercomputers to personal computers. Manufacturers, by and large, are not enthusiastic about open systems. They lower prices, cut gross profit margins and reduce the possibilities for product differentiation. The demand is coming from customers, with government departments in the vanguard, who are seeking ways of cutting the cost of data processing. Against this background of traumatic technological change, the recession in much of the developed world caught the computer industry off guard. Decisions on capital spending were delayed as corporations became increasingly concerned about the future. And a new caution over the value of information technology is being experienced by an industry which has taken for granted an annual increment in the information technology spend. Mr James Unruh, chairman and chief executive of Unisys, the US computing giant recovering from a net loss of Dollars 1.3bn in 1991 told analysts recently: 'Growth has slowed because users are not able to absorb new technology at today's rate of technological change'. The strategies for survival adopted by the leading computer makers have common elements. 'Rightsizing:' restructuring has become common throughout the industry as companies shed staff to match more modest market expectations. IBM is creating a slimmer, less bureaucratic organisation comprising a federation of business units each with its own profit and loss responsibilities. In a major change of policy, IBM's manufacturing units will be able to sell their products outside the company if they wish; marketing units will be able to buy from other suppliers to meet customers' requirements. Some 20,000 jobs were lost last year and a further 20,000 are expected to go this year. For the first time, IBM managers are pondering introducing forced redundancy: their own jobs will be on the line if their units fail to come up to centrally set profit targets. Alliances: individual organisations can no longer cover the computing waterfront. Alliances are necessary to share research and development costs, provide economies of scale for product sales and increase distribution. Groupe Bull of France, for example, which lost money heavily both in 1990 and 1991, has formed an alliance with IBM which will give it access to IBM's reduced instruction set (risc) technology and a new channel for distributing its Zenith personal computers. IBM, for its part, secures increased volume for its risc production lines and access to Bull's well-regarded networking technology. Alliances of this kind, which may or may not involve equity investment, have become common. NEC of Japan has a small stake in Bull; Fujitsu of Japan owns ICL of the UK and has shares in the US companies Amdahl, Hal and Poqet. Olivetti of Italy has no single major alliance but has placed large advertisements in national papers to reassure customers that it benefits from 229 smaller arrangements. Moves into services: as margins in hardware tighten, manufacturers are turning to software, maintenance, data communications and recovery services to maintain revenues. ICL of the UK, for example, now derives more revenues from services than hardware. It has become the UK's largest services company ahead of Electronic Data Systems, BT Customer Services, IBM and AT&amp;T Istel. IBM is forming national organisations to benefit from the trend to 'outsourcing' among customers - placing responsibility for the company's data processing with a third party. There is no certainty that any of these measures will succeed. The computer industry is peering into the unknown. As Mr Francis Lorentz, chairman of Groupe Bull said recently: 'Nobody knows if there is a way of managing distribution profitably at 25-30 per cent gross margins.'</p>

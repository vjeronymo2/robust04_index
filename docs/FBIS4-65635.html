			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is very  pleased with his visit to Russia, which ended today. [passage  omitted]    President Martti Ahtisaari, unlike previous presidents,  carried out his first official visit to Russia according to a  short schedule. During his visit, which only lasted 25 hours,  Ahtisaari had time to meet President Boris Yeltsin and Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin several times. This morning he met the  leaders of both chambers of Parliament. On returning to  Finland, Ahtisaari reiterated that there are no political  problems between the two countries.    According to the president, future relations will be handled  more and more between the parliaments. He cited as an example  the exchange of visits by the Foreign Affairs Committees.  [passage omitted]    According to the president, when Finland becomes a member of  the European Union [EU], trade between Finland and Russia will  be guided primarily by agreements between Russia and the EU.    The industrial delegation that accompanied Ahtisaari on his  visit held talks with the Russians that concentrated on how the  financing of individual deals could be guaranteed. There is  currently no comprehensive system in Russia which would  guarantee repayment of loans. No individual large deals were  signed during the trip.    At the end of the presidential news conference given at  Helsinki-Vantaa Airport, the president explained when asked what  he did late last night. According to Ahtisaari, the atmosphere  at the dinner was enlivened mainly by good orchestral music.  After the dinner, which ended at about 2100, he had discussions  with the Finnish industrial delegation. The president's night  ended with a football match between AC Milan and Barcelona.

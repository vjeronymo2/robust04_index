			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> B. Technical Amendments to Section 402.2d <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Department is also making a technical amendment to paragraph (j) of &sect;402.2d of the GSA regulations. Currently, paragraph (j) of &sect;402.2d, which modifies &sect;240.15c3&hyph;1d(c)(5)(i), prohibits a registered government securities broker or dealer from entering into a temporary subordinated loan during any period in which the broker or dealer is subject to ``any of the reporting provisions'' of &sect;405.3. Although the requirement in &sect;405.3 to file supplemental financial reports (i.e., FOGS or FOCUS Reports) in the event of a capital deficiency or the breaching of early warning levels is being eliminated, the Department is retaining the capital rule's prohibition against a registered government securities broker or dealer obtaining a temporary subordinated loan during a period of financial or operational difficulty. Accordingly, paragraph (j) is being amended to prohibit a registered government securities broker or dealer from obtaining a temporary subordinated loan if it has given notice under &sect;405.3 within the preceding thirty days. This amendment will enable the DEAs to prevent a registered government securities broker or dealer from obtaining temporary loans during periods in which the broker or dealer may be experiencing financial or operational difficulties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> III. Special Analysis <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Because this final rule is merely a conforming amendment, the Department has determined that it is not a ``significant regulatory action'' as defined in Executive Order 12866. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)), the Department for good cause finds that issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking and requesting comment are unnecessary. This rulemaking merely makes corrections to the existing GSA rule to conform it to the amendments to the SEC rule upon which it is based. The rule makes no independent substantive changes in the treatment of government securities brokers and dealers_they have previously been subject to reporting requirements parallel to other registered brokers and dealers, and they will continue to be subject to reporting requirements parallel to other registered brokers and dealers. This rule change imposes no additional burdens or requirements on government securities brokers and dealers. For these reasons, the Department is issuing the rule in final form, with an immediate effective date, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because no notice and public comment are required for this rulemaking, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C 601,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ), do not apply. In addition, the information collections concerning this rule have been previously reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)) and assigned control number 1535&hyph;0089. This rulemaking makes no substantive change to the information collection requirements except to delete the requirement that a registered government securities broker or dealer file a FOGS or FOCUS Report after experiencing a capital deficiency or triggering the early warning level notice requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR Part 402 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brokers, Government securities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR Part 405 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Brokers, Government securities, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the Preamble, 17 CFR Parts 402 and 405 are amended as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 402_FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

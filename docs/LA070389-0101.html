			<p><P> July 3, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> AYERS PROMOTED TO HEAD OHIO ST. BASKETBALL COACH  </P> <P> After a nationwide search, Ohio State promoted from within today when Randy  Ayers was named to succeed Gary Williams as the Buckeyes' head basketball  coach.  </P> <P> The selection of Ayers, Williams' top assistant, was announced at a news  conference by Athletic Director Jim Jones.  </P> <P> "We believe we've conducted a very thorough national search," Jones said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1st Black in Job  </P> <P> Ayers, the Buckeyes' 11th basketball coach and the first black to hold the job,  said he hopes to maintain "the honesty and integrity" of the school's program.  </P> <P> "I feel a deep sense of gratification . . . for the high honor," Ayers said.  </P> <P> The appointment must be approved by the university board of trustees.  </P> <P> The announcement ended a three-week search for a replacement after Williams  resigned to take over at Maryland, his alma mater.  </P> <P> Although Ayers, 33, has never been a head coach, he was Williams' top assistant  after being elevated to full-time status in May, 1987.  </P> <P> Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson had been a front-runner for the job after two  other candidates -- Jim Crews of Evansville and Lon Kruger of Kansas State --  withdrew from contention Friday.  </P> <P> But Richardson announced Sunday that he had withdrawn his name from  consideration, saying he made his decision when he compared the comforts of  Fayetteville, Ark., to the big-city living that would come with a job in  Columbus.  </P></p>

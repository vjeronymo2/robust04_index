			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF DUFFY PUT DRUG MONEY IN SECRET ACCOUNT  </P> <P> Sheriff John Duffy, prohibited since June from spending money seized in drug  raids without county approval, failed to deposit more than $300,000 worth of  drug funds into the county treasury and instead set up a separate, secret  account.  </P> <P> The district attorney's office said Thursday that it will decide this week  whether to investigate Duffy's use of the money, which may violate a county  ordinance mandating the money be deposited into the county treasury and  requiring the Board of Supervisors' approval before it is spent.  </P> <P> However, because Duffy may have paid the district attorney's office a share of  the money for its part in the drug seizure program, the state attorney  general's office may be called in to avoid a conflict of interest, said William  J. Kelly, the county's assistant auditor and controller.  </P> <P> Duffy confirmed in an interview this week that he set up the separate account  but refused to elaborate. Assistant Sheriff Jack Drown, who is running in  Tuesday's election to replace Duffy, said his boss mentioned starting such an  account, and that Drown warned against it.  </P> <P> "He's been making mystifying decisions for 20 years," Drown said. "I'm not John  Duffy's keeper."  </P> <P> Sgt. Glenn Revell, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said Duffy believes that  the money is legally under the sheriff's control.  </P> <P> "These are not county funds, these are federal funds, and it's our belief that  we're accountable to the federal government for this money, not the Board of  Supervisors," Revell said, adding that Duffy sought and received permission  from the Justice Department to set up the separate account.  </P> <P> County Supervisor Brian Bilbray said he is astounded by such logic.  </P> <P> "These are public funds!" he said. "You can't take checks and slip them into a  different bank account. This is the United States, not South America.  </P> <P> "For a man who has years of public service as an elected official, this is one  hell of a terrible way to depart the scene," Bilbray said. "I don't think there  was criminal intent here; I think it was plain stupidity."  </P> <P> Revell said he does not know how much money has been gathered in the separate  account or what it was spent for. The Times had not received its public records  request for a breakdown of the drug-fund program as of Thursday. He also  ignored repeated requests for telephone interviews, except to chide a Times  reporter for repeatedly calling him.  </P> <P> The U.S. attorney's office said the Sheriff's Department received $318,865 in  drug seizure funds between July 1 and Sept. 30, a period when Duffy should have  deposited the money with the county treasury. Overall, the department has  received $3.1 million since the drug-fund program began in September, 1986.  </P> <P> County attorneys and auditors already were investigating Duffy's use of nearly  $70,000 in drug funds to pay an attorney in a civil lawsuit. Duffy paid the law  firm of Martin J. Mayer to defend himself against lawsuits by six deputies who  were disciplined by Duffy for their involvement in activities of the so-called  "Rambo Squad" at County Jail in El Cajon.  </P> <P> The cases were settled out of court.  </P> <P> Auditors warned Duffy in June that he was wrong to spend drug money on his  attorney. Asked to reimburse the drug fund account, Duffy refused.  </P> <P> Auditor Kelly said that Duffy may be forced to refund the money if county  attorneys rule that the payment was illegal. Federal guidelines established in  1984 allowed law enforcement officials to keep money and property seized in  drug arrests. Two years later, federal officials ruled that the money could be  used "for law enforcement purposes only."  </P> <P> Although the definition is broad, many police agencies prefer to use the money  to fight drug offenders.  </P></p>

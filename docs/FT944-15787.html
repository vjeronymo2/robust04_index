			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Business Travel (Update): Airline strike ends Scandinavian Airlines System's check-in staff in Copenhagen have ended a three-day wildcat strike that grounded most of the carrier's European flights. The stoppage ended after an arbitration court agreed to discuss the strikers' demands and told them to resume work, officials said. The airline, jointly owned by Sweden, Denmark and Norway, said its inter-continental and domestic flights were not affected by the action, nor were other airlines. About 800 employees stopped work last Wednesday, protesting at the carrier's refusal to re-instate a union official who had been fired.</p>

			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): New pages for the notebooks Notebook computer users never stop clamouring for more power, greater flexibility, longer battery life and lower prices. Two UK-based companies have responded to the challenge by producing PCs with special features including removable hard disks and built-in pointing devices. They will be launched at next month's UK Business Computing '92 show. Weighing 5.5lb, the Elonex NB-425X features an Intel 25MHz 486SX upgradeable processor and a choice of four screens. Elonex claims the machines offer battery life of up to 18 hours. Prices are expected to start at around Pounds 1,000 for the mono models and Pounds 1,500 plus VAT for colour. Meanwhile, CPW Computer Consultants claims to be first in the UK with a notebook machine built around an Intel 50Mhz 486DX2 processor and an active matrix colour display. The EPS425DX2, which weighs 6.3lbs, features a removable hard disk and built-in tracker ball slot. The colour version is expected to sell for about Pounds 3,900 and a mono version for Pounds 2,700. Elonex: UK, 081 452 4444. CPW: 071 922 8890.</p>

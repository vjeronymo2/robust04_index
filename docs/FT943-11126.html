			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / International Company News: BASF postpones investment in Italy BASF, the German chemicals group, has postponed investment in Italy because of the government-inspired price cuts and healthcare reforms. The move follows the decision last month by Menarini, Italy's largest domestic drugs company, to transfer all production out of Italy because of the government's aggressive attitude to the pharmaceuticals industry. Mr Giovanni Pinamonti, BASF's Italian managing director, explained to the Financial Times newsletter, Pharmaceutical Business News: 'There is no (state) industrial strategy (in Italy) for the development of the pharmaceutical industry.' BASF has decided for the moment not to carry on with plans to concentrate worldwide gastrointestinal research in Milan, nor increase its Italian manufacturing capacity, said Mr Pinamonti. European drugs companies are bracing themselves for another blow to the troubled Italian drugs market. Last week the Italian cabinet agreed a 10 per cent price cut for next year, although the decision has yet to be approved by Parliament. Mr Raffaele Costa, health minister, said: 'If it was up to me I would cut prices even further.' Ciba, the Swiss group, has admitted it lost L41.7bn (Dollars 26m) last year in Italy, partly because of the devaluation of the lira, partly because of investment, and partly because of healthcare reform. Among the domestic groups, Brokers James Capel estimate Menarini and Sigma Tau would be hit hardest by any additional price cut. Respectively, about 37 per cent and 41 per cent of their sales are in Italy. Among the multinational groups Ares-Serono of Switzerland and Pharmacia, the Swedish group, would be most affected. Healthcare reforms introduced in January have had a large effect on the Italian sector. Growth in all leading European drugs markets has slowed so far this year, but the Italian market has been the worst hit in Europe. Year-on-year sales during the first five months have fallen 7 per cent to Dollars 3.08bn from Dollars 3.59bn. That compares with Dollars 4.7bn for the same period in 1992, according to IMS International, the specialist market research group.</p>

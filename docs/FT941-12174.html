			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / Beaches with EU rating ruled safe Stomach upsets can be expected from swimming in dirty sea water but beaches that meet European Commission standards should be safe, a government report said yesterday. Only 80 per cent of the UK's 458 classified bathing beaches now meet European standards, according to government figures. Water companies are investing billions of pounds to comply with rules to stop pumping sewage into the sea. Yesterday's report was the final stage in a four-year study. It questioned 16,000 people on eight beaches and found that Morecambe in Lancashire, Cleethorpes in Humberside, and Ramsgate in Kent were among the beaches where bathers suffered unusual rates of health problems. Infections appeared to be linked to the length of time spent in the water.</p>

The brother president made a speech, in which he expressed  happiness to share with the brother officers, noncommissioned  officers, and troops their celebration of the divisions's  founding anniversary. He praised the role played by the members  of the 1st Armored Division in defending the revolution since  the Division was formed as a first battalion in the Armored  Corps in 1967. The struggler of the Division fought bravely to  defend the revolution and the Republican regime after pledging  to God, the homeland, and the revolution to champion the will of  the people and their aspirations for a better life. They, along  with their brothers the members of the Armed Forces, were heroes  in the 70-day epic when they defended Sanaa against the  conspiracies of the mercenaries and the enemies of the  Republican regime.    The brother chairman said: We are confident that our Armed  Forces, which defended the Republican regime and made precious  sacrifices, will offer more sacrifices in the defense of  national and Yemeni unity and will fight anyone who entertains  the idea of harming the people's great achievement. The Armed  Forces will also firmly oppose all elements that try to harm the  great achievement made on 22 May 1990 -- an irreversible  achievement for all the Yemeni people that cannot be  relinquished.    Addressing troops, noncommissioned officers, and officers,  he  said: You should be armed with national awareness and vigilance  to perform your national duties in defending the people's gains,  primarily unity and democracy. Your potent weapon is not  armored vehicles or equipment or supplies, but your faith in God  and the homeland, the revolution and unity.    We are confident that our Armed Forces in al-Mahrah, Sa'dah,  Shabwah, Hadramaut, Ta'izz, Ibb, Abyan, Lahd, al-Hudaydah,  Ma'rib, and any governorate in the republic, will be with the  homeland and the people and will never be a pliable tool in the  hands of any element or party that wants to harm the homeland,  its unity, and democratic approach. Also, they will not allow  the forces that are hostile to the revolution, unity, and  democracy to achieve their aims or set the clock back. History  has a bright record of our Armed Forces and its valiant men. At  this important juncture in the life of our homeland, history  will only record a bright chapter about the sacrifices of our  Armed Forces and their firm support for the people's choices and  their championing of its causes and constants, foremost of which  is safeguarding unity and democracy. The annals of history will  only include the names of sincere people who are faithful to  their principles and who make sacrifices for these principles.  History will not include the names of indecisive, weak  characters who have no principles.    The brother chairman added: Unity was achieved by a  peaceful, democratic means. It made Yemen a giant in front of  the world. It is unacceptable that whims and personal interests  should gain the upper hand and harm this achievement. We should  be more mature in our conduct and thinking in light of this  great event and the changes yielded by our new situation. I am  fully confident that all the heroes of our Armed Forces will be  the shield of unity and will fight relentlessly all those who  urge division and all forms of regional, parochial, and racial  affiliations. We are a Yemeni, Arab, and Muslim people whose  loyalty is to God, the homeland, the revolution, and unity.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A ceremony was held at Lan Xang Hotel on the  evening of 29 April to sign a contract to buy a 50-kw short wave  radio broadcasting system between the Ministry of Information  and Culture and the Telstra Company of Australia. Representing  the Lao side at the signing ceremony was Bounteng Vongsai,  deputy minister of information and culture; while the Australian  side was represented by Barley, Telstra Lao branch director.  Witnessing the contract signing were Bouasi Chaleunsouk, deputy  minister of information and culture; Michael Mann, ambassador  extraordinary and plenipotentiary of Australia to Laos;  representatives of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and  Finance; and senior officials from various services concerned.    The aim of purchasing the 50-kw short wave radio  broadcasting  system at a cost of more than $1 million is to allow all  localities and provinces throughout the country to receive  broadcasting programs of the national radio station. This is  because at present, many regions in the country are still unable  to tune in the station's programs. Installation of the system  will enable our country to possess a new modern short wave radio  broadcasting station to beam radio programs to all regions  throughout the country. Installation of this new radio  transmitter will be completed within one year beginning on the  day the contract was signed.</p>

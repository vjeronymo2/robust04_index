			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Hilka Birns] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Feb 25 SAPA -- Africa expects South  Africa's leaders to leave no stone unturned to overcome their  political differences and to enable a free and peaceful  election. This was the message which Organisation of African  Unity Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim conveyed in his  discussions this week to a wide range of political leaders and  roleplayers.    Speaking at a Johannesburg press conference on Friday [25  February] night, Dr. Salim said more efforts should be made and  political leaders should get together to find an all-inclusive  political settlement. It was in the interest of South Africa  and Africa that dialogue continued, no matter how difficult the  process. "No stone should be left unturned to see even at this  11th hour if a solution can be found."    He welcomed the announced meeting next Tuesday between  Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and  African National Congress President Nelson Mandela. "This is a  challenge coming at a critical moment and I hope it will be  successful," he said.    Dr. Salim said his two-hour meeting with Mr Buthelezi in  Ulundi earlier on Friday had been "very interesting and candid".  The IFP president had explained his concerns and reservations  to participating in the election, while Dr. Salim had spelt out  to him Africa's expectations of a peaceful election in which all  parties took part.    Dr. Salim said he had pointed out to Mr Buthelezi that in  any  negotiations, participants had to be prepared to make  compromises. The government and the ANC had made some  "significant" concessions, he said.    Asked whether he believed the Afrikaner Volksfront's  [National Front -- AVF] demands for a volkstaat [homeland] were  reasonable, he said this was a matter for South Africans to  decide.    The OAU would like to see a united South Africa in which  Afrikaners played an important and constructive role in the  democratic process, like respecting and understanding the  country's cultural diversity, he said.    Dr. Salim said he remained optimistic about South Africa's  future for as long as leaders were prepared to talk to each  other. What gave him hope was that all roleplayers had  indicated that they still wanted to be part of the democratic  process, he said.    During his fact-finding mission Dr. Salim also had in-depth  talks with among others Mr Mandela, Foreign Affairs Minister Pik  Botha, Gen Constand Viljoen of the AVF, Pan Africanist Congress  Deputy President Johnson Mlambo, Independent Electoral  Commission Chairman Mr Justice Johann Kriegler and Mr Justice  Richard Goldstone of the Goldstone Commission. He is to meet  state President FW de Klerk before his departure on Saturday.</p>

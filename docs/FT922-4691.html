			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Allied-Signal gets into shape - Martin Dickson looks at the improved performance of the US group THE SHARE price says it all: In the year since Mr Lawrence Bossidy was named as chairman of Allied-Signal, the stock market value of one of America's biggest industrial technology companies has more than doubled. The increase - from around Dollars 29 a share to about Dollars 60 - was initially due to Mr Bossidy's reputation as one of America's top managers. But more recently the increase has reflected the remarkable improvement in Allied's performance as he has imposed a slimming and muscle-toning regimen on what had been a distinctly flabby body. The question now is whether, with the easiest improvements already in hand, he can keep the share price rising. A tall, intense man, who speaks at breakneck speed, Mr Bossidy came to Allied from General Electric, the industrial and financial services group which has a reputation as one of the best-managed companies in the US. For seven years, Mr Bossidy had been number two to GE's chairman, Mr Jack Welch, and before that he masterminded the creation of GE's huge financial services arm. At Allied he replaced Mr Edward Hennessy, who retired after 12 years as chairman. During that time he turned a stodgy chemical company - Allied Chemical - into a Dollars 12bn turnover high technology conglomerate through acquisitions such as Bendix (in 1983) and Signal (1985). The result is a company with three legs: aerospace, with products such as aircraft engines and brakes; automotive, making parts such as braking systems, seat belts and spark plugs; and engineered materials, making products ranging from carpet fibres to automotive catalysts. The Hennessy years made Allied a much stronger (albeit still rather anonymous) company, less vulnerable to the economic cycle. But, along the way, it lost a clear sense of direction, and its proliferating bureaucracy and loose management controls contributed to a lacklustre earnings record and poor image on Wall Street. Enter Mr Bossidy, bursting with the latest management ideas, fine-honed at General Electric. His conclusion: Allied was potentially a fine company with strong market positions in each of its fields and good technology. But it was not working its assets hard enough and not getting the best out of employees. He has set some ambitious long-term financial goals, including boosting the operating margin from 5 per cent to 9 per cent by 1994, improving productivity by 6 per cent a year, and reaching a return on equity of 18 per cent by 1994, against 10.5 per cent last year. Stage one has involved a wholesale streamlining of the business. Plants have been consolidated (mainly in the automotive business); materials purchasing has been centralised to achieve economies of scale; so too have group services, for example with one data centre replacing 10. The salaried workforce is being cut by 6,200, or 16 per cent. Mr Bossidy estimates all this will produce savings of Dollars 400m a year by 1994, with the bulk of that - Dollars 300m - coming through this year, giving a Dollars 1.30 a share boost to earnings. The company believes this will allow it to earn from Dollars 3.60 to Dollars 3.85 a share this year, depending on the strength of the US economic recovery, compared with Dollars 2.51 in 1991 (before one-time restructuring charges). He has also reversed what had become a rather worrying drain of cash from the business, which in the middle of last year looked likely to total Dollars 750m on an annual basis. However, Allied preserved cash by measures such as cutting its dividend and increasing the intensity with which it turns over working capital. The company has long been criticised by Wall Street for excessive R and D spending, and Mr Bossidy has attacked this, too, capping 1992 spending at Dollars 380m a year, roughly the same as 1991, and insisting the money be used more productively. All these measures meant the cash drain from the business last year was just Dollars 195m, while this year it is expecting cash-flow to be neutral. Mr Bossidy also wants to reduce the group's indebtedness, which currently stands at 42 per cent of total capital, through the disposal of Allied's US oil and gas assets, which the company values at Dollars 1bn. But at the moment the market for energy assets is weak. While this quick-fire action has certainly given an impressive boost to the company's financial performance, it remains questionable just how strongly it can keep growing over the long haul. After all, it faces intense international competition in all of its markets, and the aerospace sector looks particularly vulnerable, given US defence cuts and a weak commercial aviation market. Mr Bossidy says Allied will greatly benefit from even a moderate upturn in the depressed US auto market, and its chemicals side will also be helped by a US economic rebound. As for aerospace, he points out that sales to the Pentagon account for only 34 per cent of the subsidiary's total, and that most of these revenues come from mature programmes, where there is a lot of demand for spare parts which should decline slowly. 'While we will be hurt to some extent . . . we don't think its going to be a dramatic dislocation.' As for the civil side, he acknowledges the airlines are currently suffering, but thinks this will be a good business in the long term. The company is still working on its long-term strategic plan, which it expects to unveil after a major management debate this summer. Mr Bossidy argues that for a company such as Allied to succeed in the 1990s it needs two essential ingredients: improving productivity to boost margins, because competition will keep a lid on its ability to raise prices; and 'a global reach because markets are going to become less distinguished.' He is pushing for productivity improvements through the fashionable theory of total quality management - the idea of driving for continuous quality improvements by concentrating on customers needs and worker involvement. The aim is to train all employees by the end of next year, and Mr Bossidy says it is vital that this genuinely changes the group's culture and is not 'just a banner, a slogan, a lot of fluff.' As for international growth, Allied already has a large presence in Europe, which accounts for Dollars 2.9bn of group sales and 15,000 of its 94,000 employees. The bulk of this comes from automotive components, but earlier this month it began a big expansion of its industrial fibres operation with construction of a new Dollars 220m plant in France. Mr Bossidy, who also sees major opportunities in south-east Asia, hopes to build the group's overseas sales to 40 to 45 per cent of the group total, from 30 per cent now. Acquisitions, both domestic and foreign, will have a role in the growth. Mr Bossidy says he would like to do two or three Dollars 300m niche takeovers a year. He has certainly made a dramatic, racing start. But sustaining the improvement in Allied's performance, as he himself acknowledges, is going to require a fundamental change in the corporation's culture. The hardest part may just be beginning.</p>

			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Labour 'would take back coal pits' The next Labour government would renationalise coal mines if that was what mineworkers wanted, Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, told the Commons last night, Ivor Owen writes. Responding to a challenge from Mr Patrick McLoughlin, a junior minister, Mr Cook said he would be 'astonished' if Labour's plans for rescuing the coal industry did not involve public ownership. Mr Dennis Skinner, leftwing Labour MP for Bolsover who is sponsored by the National Union of Mineworkers, described this as 'a big improvement'. A Labour attempt to prevent the closure of any more pits before the establishment of the new Coal Authority provided for by the coal industry bill was defeated by 31.</p>

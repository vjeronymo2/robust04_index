			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Research Group on "An Overall Design for China's </F> Economic System Reform," headed by Wu Jinglian (0709 2417 8834):  "Basic Ideas About the Establishment of a New System for  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control and Management of  State-Owned Assets"]    [Text] The 14th Party Congress clearly stated the goal for  China's economic system to be the building of a socialist market  economy system. I believe that in order to realize this goal, we  should institute as quickly as possible associated tax, fiscal,  and financial system, as well as conduct investment control  system reform to provide a basic framework for the attainment  within three to five years of a national macroeconomic  regulation and control system in the socialist market economy.  At the same time, we should actively promote reform of the  state-owned assets control system to lay the foundation for a  new equity rights system in which public ownership is paramount  in the operation of the market economy.    1. Intensification of taxation, fiscal, finance and  banking and investment control system reform and moving ahead  with state-owned assets control system reform is urgently  required for the building of a socialist market economy to solve  deep-seated problems in development of the nation's economy.    Since 1992, China's reform, opening to the outside world,  and  modernization have entered a new era. The overall reform and  development situation is good, but some deep-seated  contradictions and problems remain in the operation of the  economy. One is that an effective macroeconomic regulation and  control system and microeconomic restraint systems have yet to  be built; thus, a new round of high growth of total social  demand is in the offing. Second, demand inflation and structural  imbalances exist at the same time. Improvements to the product  mix, the industrial structure, and the irrational enterprise  organizational structure have not been great. Structural  inconsistences further complicate overall balance. Third,  despite the rapid economic growth, overall economic returns  remain not very high. State-owned enterprises' losses continue  high, and a serious problem exists with enterprises delaying  payment of their obligations. Fourth, the fiscal and financial  situations are grim; thus, the central government macroeconomic  regulation and control capabilities are extremely weak. On the  one hand, the trend is toward an increase in the central  government fiscal deficit, the government being able to obligate  only approximately 38 billion yuan each year for the capital  construction of key projects. Government is unable to change the  seriously backward state of basic sectors. On the other hand,  structural readjustment pressures are transferred to the banks.  This intensifies the trend toward greater government  underwriting of credit. Central bank difficulties in controlling  the main throttle valve of total money supply adds to  inflationary pressures.    The current economic situation suggests that inflation has  begun to appear. Naturally emergency actions will have to be  taken at once to deal with it in order to prevent a  deterioration of the economic situation. However, grim realities  indicate that given the existing institutions, the effect of the  actions we are able to take will be limited. Thus the root  causes of large scale economic ups and downs will remain. During  the near term, a basic action is to accelerate macroeconomic  system and enterprise system reforms, readjusting the benefits  stimulation mechanisms in enterprises, and governments at all  levels, improving risk limitation mechanisms, and provide the  policy tools needed for indirect macroeconomic regulation and  control for the building of macroeconomic system that realizes  policy goals.    The existing macroeconomic system suggests the main reasons  for the foregoing inconsistencies and problems to be as follows:    The problems with the tax system are manifested mostly in a  narrow tax base, too great a dependence on processing  industries, and inability to respond to sources of revenue, all  of which make for unstable fiscal revenues. Second, taxation  plays too great a role in the readjustment of the industrial  structure and enterprises under different ownership systems. Tax  policies have too great a bias; thus, the various taxable items  and tax rates are too complex and the tax burdens are not equal.  Third, the overly biased revenue policies not only render the  attainment of policy goals difficult, but they damage the unity  and the coherence of the tax system, thereby opening many  loopholes for tax evasion and tax cheating, which increases tax  collection and administration difficulties.    Neither the existing "fiscal contracting" nor the impending  fiscal system of "contracting tax sharing" provide an  institutional basis for regularizing financial distributions  between the central government and local governments. First of  all, the division of fiscal revenues is still according to  administrative subordination, which is detrimental to the  separation of government administration and enterprise  management. Second, an overly large percentage of turnover  taxes, which have a substantial impact on the economic  structure, go to local jurisdictions. This results in redundant  construction and vying among jurisdictions for high speed  growth, which intensifies economic fluctuations and regional  separation. In addition, the haggling and the strict  guaranteeing of base figures associated with fiscal contracting  produce a regressive mechanism in central government fiscal  revenues in which the central government lacks financial  strength, and the ability of the central government to apply  fiscal measuresto adjust the structure becomes weaker and  weaker. Finally, as the economy grows, growth of fiscal revenues  slows. During the "real estate craze" of 1992, enterprise  profits increased, and industrial growth reached 20 percent, but  land-use revenues and income tax revenues declined for the  period January through October, while product taxes increased  only 5.2 percent. Moreover, the overly rapid increase in fiscal  expenditures causes a widening of fiscal policies. Fiscal  revenues that are lower than production increase has become a  serious problem in 1993. During the first quarter of the year,  fiscal revenue growth amounted to only one-half the increase in  GDP, and only one-third the increase in industrial production.    The functions of the finance and banking system are ill  defined and lacking in vitality. First, the central bank carries  too heavy a responsibility for readjusting the economic  structure. Some of its expanded administrative tasks frequently  conflict with its goal of controlling total demand. Second is  too great reliance on administrative fiat to regulate and  control the money supply, and the central bank's lack of policy  tools for indirect regulation and control of money makes  effective and flexible readjustment of total demand difficult.  Third, the operating mechanism of the specialized banks have a  strong administrative coloration. They lack vitality, and they  have numerous accounts pending, unpaid debts, and bad debts. The  quality of their assets has declined further. Therefore,  whenever total demand inflates excessively, both effective  monetary policy tools and a finance and banking system that can  attain monetary policy goals are missing. These banks continue  to have no choice but to rely on administrative fiat and command  style methods to control total demand. The result is they can  neither control money outside plan nor can they prevent damage  to key construction projects covered by state plan.    The planning system has yet to break free from controls on  microeconomic activity. Static control methods for achieving  equilibrium in planning are still adopted, a substantial amount  of effort going into the setting of norms, the apportionment of  investment, project approvals, and sharing foreign exchange.  Ability to integrate macroeconomic policy methods in a  comprehensive way is weak.    Investment decision-making authority is still too greatly  centralized in government departments at all levels. Control  methods continue to be mostly administrative fiat, control of  scale, and project examination and approval. The most  conspicuous problem is that investment project decision making,  fund raising, construction, production, and operation, as well  as debt repayment, are divorced from each other. A mechanism is  lacking for spelling out responsibilities and for limiting  risks. This leads to ill-advised investment, redundant  construction, and low returns that causes serious waste. With  the further deregulation of prices, operation of the economy --  particularly the degree to which enterprises' operating  activities will be oriented toward the market -- will accelerate  greatly. Failure of macroeconomic system reform to keep up will  mean that frictions between the existing control system and  enterprises or markets will become worse and worse. This will  directly impair sustained and steady national economic growth.  Therefore, further intensification of macroeconomic regulation  and control system reform has become an urgent necessity in the  building of a market economy and in ensuring the nation's  steady, high speed economic growth.    Delay in reforming the state-owned enterprise equity system  is one of the basic reasons for the various economic problems  mentioned above. So long as state-owned enterprise equity rights  are unclear, there is no separation of government administration  and enterprise management, and the limits of authority are not  spelled out, formation of genuine market entities will be  difficult. Enterprises cannot be expected to react fully to  macroeconomic regulation and control signals. Only enterprises  whose equity rights are clear, who make their own operating  decisions, and who are responsible for their own profits and  losses can be the nucleus for a market economy. However, effort  to reform enterprises' operating mechanisms entirely from the  microeconomic angle cannot fundamentally change this situation.  Thus, reform of the state-owned assets control system is needed,  rebuilding the state-owned enterprise equity rights system by  transforming the state-owned enterprise equity structure.    2. The Basic Pattern of the New System of State  Macroeconomic Regulation and Control, and the Goals of System  Reform    We have the following tentative ideas about the goals, basic  functions, division of labor among various sectors, and the  goals of system reform that take into account both the  requirements for a market economy and the state of China's  economic development.    A) Main Goals of State Macroeconomic Regulation and  Control: The main goals of state macroeconomic regulation  and control are to regulate total demand, and to ensure economic  stability and growth, as well as to balance international  receipts and expenditures; to remedy shortcomings of the market  mechanism so as to be able to provide public products and  services to society, regulate income distribution, ensure social  equality, and promote balanced regional development; and to  adopt appropriate industrial policies in order to advance  structural improvements and increase total supply capabilities.    B) Basic Pattern of the Functional Division of Labor of  Main Macroeconomic Policies. Regulation and control of  total supply is achieved mostly through monetary policy, and  through appropriate readjustment of the economic structure and  fiscal methods. Industrial policies are largely functional  policies. Too wide ranging tilt policies are not used since the  goal is to promote change and upgrading of the economic  structure. The tax system is gradually moving in a neutral  direction.    This basic pattern has the following several components:    First, the main functions of the taxation system  are to provide the government with a steady revenue base and to  create a fair environment for market competition. Taxation  policy mostly regulates the distribution of income. Taxation  policy is gradually changing awaya from the use of preferential  taxation policies to allocate resources; ultimately, taxation  will become neutral. Thus, for a fairly long time to come,  indirect taxes -- mostly added value taxes -- will predominate.  Land taxes and resources taxes should also hold an important  position. Enterprise income taxes will decline as a percentage  of all taxes, and the position of the individual income tax will  gradually rise, ultimately becoming one of the main kinds of  taxation. A transition will be made gradually from mostly  indirect taxation to direct taxation. In order to ensure a broad  tax base and steady revenues, a fairly high percentage of  indirect taxation, such as added value taxes, is currently  necessary. However, added value taxes are taxes levied on key  element income. They differ fundamentally from turnover taxes  such as product taxes. The added value tax can ensure steady  revenues from a wide range of sources while avoiding the double  taxation of the turnover tax and the structural distortions.    Second, The main function of the fiscal system is  to use the redistribution of fiscal revenues and the use of  government funds to promote balanced regional development; to  provide public infrastructure and social services to sustain  long-term, steady, and balanced economic growth; and to use  fiscal policy to regulate the level of total demand. Exercising  this function requires institution of a standard tax  distribution system that spells out the powers and fiscal  authorities of the central and local governments so as to ensure  the active interest of both parties. When organizing fiscal  revenues, the central government must have the lion's share,  this apportionment serving as the foundation for building a  system whereby the central government transfers payments of  fiscal revenues to local government, thereby increasing the  central government's regulation and control capabilities.  Performance of this function requires the building of a new  long-term financing system for policy purposes that relies on  the state's credit to attract funds to be used over a long  period, the state paying compensation for their use, these funds  being used for the building of infrastructure and basic  industries requiring a long period for recovery of capital. This  forms a new fiscal system that is fairly able to normalize  relations between the central government and local government,  that fairly equitably balances fiscal capabilities between one  region and another, and that effectively adjusts the economic  structure.    Third, The central bank is a key player in the  finance and banking system. The central bank's monetary policies  are important means of macroeconomic regulation and control.  Monetary policies are basically restraining policies who goal is  to stabilize the currency as a precondition for ensuring total  supply capabilities. The central bank must exercise supervision  and control over banking and safeguard the financial order;  however, it must not interfere in the business of the  specialized banks, much less, may it directly perform the  business of the specialized banks. The central bank may no  longer use the granting of credit for policy reasons for direct  readjustment of the economic structure. Its functions require  the building of a highly skilled and highly efficient central  banking system, development of nationwide and regional  commercial banks, and the establishment of special banks that  function to meet policy needs.    Fourth, the main function of the planning system  is the study of long-term strategy, the drawing up of long-term  plans and industrial policies, and making economic development  forecasts and providing overall balance. Doing this requires a  new concept of planning, improvement of planning methods, and a  change in the work focus of planning units.    Fifth, The almost complete deregulation of prices  has given rise to a price formation mechanism in which the  market decides prices for the most part. The state's pricing  policy consists of mostly the following: support prices for  basic agricultural products, and regulate and control prices in  sectors where a natural monopoly exists, the overall price level  and industrial monopolies regulated and controlled through  overall demand policies and monopoly regulation measures.  <H3>  3. Basic Tasks in Reform of the Macroeconomic Regulation and  Control System, and Steps To Be Taken for Their  Implementation. </H3>   A) Tasks in Tax System Reform and Steps To Be Taken for  Their Implementation    (1) Need to build a new tax system that has a broad tax  base,  in which tax burdens are fair, and in which collection and  administration are efficient.    Establishment of a new tax system requires readjustment of  the current turnover tax structure, changing the current  turnover tax system of one tax for domestically owned and  another for foreign owned enterprises, and regularizing the  turnover tax system. It also requires changing the separate  enterprise income tax that is based on whether an enterprise is  Chinese for foreign owned, and separate income taxes for Chinese  citizens and foreign citizens, establishing a uniform enterprise  income tax and individual income tax. The land tax and the  resources tax should be broadened; tax burdens should be made  more equitable; preferential tax policies should be revamped;  and ways to collect a uniform social security tax should be  studied.    Accomplishing the above tasks will require a new tax  structure that not only provides a broad tax base, ensures  steady revenues, and causes little damage to industries, but  also provides considerable choices of taxes to divide up between  the central government and local governments in the  regularization of the tax sharing system. In addition, a  standard added value tax, and a uniform income tax provide  conditions for effective collection and administration of tax  revenues. Once the new tax system is in place, every effort must  be made to make fiscal revenues a greater percentage of national  income than they currently are.    (2) Carry out tax reform and price reform more or less in  tandem.    Simultaneous with regularization of the added value tax  should be corresponding readjustments of the range of products  covered by the product tax. Since raising prices or  decontrolling prices of basic products results at once in either  overly low or overly high product taxation rates for basic  sector processing industries, readjustment of the product tax  becomes an urgent task of primary importance. The tax on a small  number of luxury goods should be retained, and redesignated an  excise tax. A one or two tier tax rate added value tax should  replace the tax on other products. Uniform tax rates should be  promoted across the board, calculation and collection of the  added value tax should be regularized, and uniform receipts that  show the tax paid or deducted should be used. These methods  should be used to establish a new pattern of indirect taxes as a  substantial percentage of all taxes to ensure steady fiscal  revenues.    At the same time, in the handling of distributions between  the state and state-owned enterprises, taxes and profits should  be separated, indebtedness repaid after taxes, and profits  distributed after taxes, in addition to which the summarization  of experiences should be used as a basis for perfecting debt  repayment and profit sharing methods. Uniform fiscal accounting  standards should form a basis for merging the Chinese owned and  foreign owned enterprise income tax to bring tax rates into line  in fact as well as in name, and the Chinese and foreign personal  income tax should be made uniform as well.    Reform of the land tax and the resources tax, broadening the  application of the land and resources tax to regulate  differential revenues from primary products following price  decontrol. In view of the current development of the real estate  sector and development zones, land taxes should be reformed at  once. Taxes should be levied on land sales, land use, land  trading, and land appreciation to increase fiscal revenues and  ensure equitable distribution of social resources.     -    -  Re-examination of tariffs, integrating this task into  domestic tax system reform and with requirements for entering  GATT for timely readjustment and reform of tariffs. Nominal  tariff rates should be reduced gradually, all item reductions  and exemptions controlled, the current very low actual tariff  rates and the overly high nominal tariff rates fundamentally  changed. Currently, China's nominal tariff rate averages 22.5  percent, but because of various reductions and exemptions, the  actual import tariff rate averages only about 10 percent. This  is lower than the average 14 percent rate of developing  countries.    -  Separation of national tax collection agencies and local tax  collection agencies. First of all, for the sake of  centralization and efficiency, everything possible should be  done to centralize in the central government all tax legislation  that is under national government control, then turn over to  local government for collection the kinds of taxes that local  government can collect more efficiently, local taxation then  being expanded somewhat. Local government should be given some  right to legislate local taxes. Central government and local  government tax collection agencies should be set up to keep  strict control over tax reductions and exemptions. Turnover tax  contracting or contracting in a disguised form must be  resolutely halted.       B) Tasks and Steps To Be Taken in Reform of the Fiscal  System    (1) Standardizing the tax sharing system, building a system  for revenue transfer payments, and building a system for  long-term financing of projects of a policy nature are basic  tasks in system reform.    Standardization of the tax sharing system requires  clarification of government functions at all levels, authority  defined on the basis of function, and payments made on the basis  of authority. The general principle for defining authority is  that each level of government will not meddle in the operation  of enterprises. In the division of powers between the central  government and local government, the central government is to be  responsible for ensuring stability of the social order, and  ensuring uniformity in markets throughout the land. It is  additionally responsible for important economic structural tasks  such as the building of a national infrastructure that cuts  across regional lines, and for readjustments in the regional and  industrial sectors. Local governments are responsible for  matters directly related to local social and economic  development, principal of which are social services including  basic local facilities, environmental clean ups and scientific,  educational, cultural, and health matters, local revenue  distribution, and social insurance policies, as well as  promotion of the development of commercial and other tertiary  industries, and improvement of the investment climate.    Standardization of the tax sharing system also requires  determination of central government and local government  revenues. In the organization of revenues, the central  government must have the lion's share. In defining the kinds of  revenues that go to the central government and local  governments, the current contract system for sharing revenues  must be changed. In the division of income taxes, the division  of revenues on the basis of the administrative subordination of  enterprises must be demolished, and turnover taxes cannot be  invariably shared jointly by the central government and local  governments. The pooling of taxes must be reduced or eliminated.    Definition of the expenditures and revenues of government at  all levels should form the basis for the central government's  concentration of some revenues for use in balancing local  governments' fiscal capabilities. A system should be set up  whereby the central government makes transfer payments of fiscal  revenues to local jurisdictions, i.e., the central government  concentrates appropriate amounts of fiscal revenues for the  subsidization of different areas according to set standards  (such as population, nature of the terrain, and per capita GNP).    Building of a new long-term financing system for policy  purposes. The basic function of long term financing for policy  purposes is to enhance the building of infrastructure, making up  for the shortage of budgeted funds. The main sources of  financing for policy purpose are funds for which compensation is  paid such as postal savings, retirement funds, and government  bonds. Central government treasury offsetting of financing costs  provides assurance that improves financing conditions. The main  fields of financing activity are basic public facilities, basic  industries, and long-term export credits that take a long time  to recoup capital, produce low profits, and pose high risks.  Public projects from which it is impossible to recoup investment  through profits are paid for by fiscal budget gratis investment.  The government financial sector may no longer meddle directly in  the financial activities of state-owned enterprises. Financial  accounting systems that closely meet international standards  have been promulgated, and the role of independent accountants  is becoming stronger; therefore, fiscal department agencies  responsible for running state-owned enterprises' fiscal affairs  should be abolished, and the functions of fiscal, tax, and state  assets administration units should be straightened out.    (2) Fiscal system reform measures should be coordinated with  price and tax reforms, reform of the revenue sharing system  conducted step by step.        -  Concomittant with price and taxation reform,  subsidization of losses incurred for policy reasons should be  phased out.    -  Reform of the standardized tax sharing system should be done  in two steps. In view of the difficulty of defining power and  establishing a transfer payments system, receipts should be  handled before expenditures. As a first step, fiscal expenditure  base figures at all levels should be frozen, reform conducted in  step with reform of indirect taxation and the income tax, and  the relationships between the central government and local  governments on revenues changed first. Inasmuch as different  kinds of taxes have different effects on the economic structure  and fiscal revenues, and bearing in mind collection and  administration capabilities, the following tax sharing pattern  should be established for several main forms of taxation: Excise  taxes, added value taxes, tariffs, and major resources taxes to  revert to the central government; business taxes, real estate  taxes, and social security taxes (or program evaluation and  review funds) to revert to local governments. Once the income  tax has been regularized, revenues from it may be jointly shared  or revert to local governments. Local government shortfalls  between receipts and expenditures should be subsidized out of  the central government treasury. In addition, reforms for the  separation of tax collection agencies should be carried out to  set up two separate tax collection and administration systems.  Second is the setting of expenditure base figures and the  make-up of expenditures on the basis of power, simultaneously  setting up a regularized system by which the central government  can make transfer payments to local governments, the central  government using this system to equalize the financial resources  of different jurisdictions and to subsidize backward areas.    -  Simultaneous with reform of the tax sharing system should be  improvement of the redundant fiscal budgeting system. Applicable  functions of fiscal units and planning units should be  readjusted or merged for the formation of long-term fiscal  financing plans. Policy purposes banks such as import-export  banks and development banks should be established as  institutions for long-term financing for policy reasons.       C) Financial System Reform Tasks and Steps for Carrying  Them Out    (1) Perfection of the central bank's macroeconomic  regulation  and control mechanism, setting up a highly skilled, highly  effective central banking system with primary level branches in  the major administrative regions. The central banks should apply  indirect regulation and control methods to control currency and  regulation and control total demand.        -  The central bank should gradually replace control of  the money supply with control of total credit, changing its  primary reliance on limited direct credit for gradual  implementation of indirect macroeconomic regulation and control.  This means using its own funds, buying up or selling off  government bonds, changing rediscount rates, and adjusting  interest rates to control basic money, thereby attaining the  goal of control total money supply.    -  Readjustment of the People's Bank organizational structure,  eliminating branches and sub-branches below the primary branch  level, and setting up one or more national commercial banks and  regional banks. The business of transporting currency and the  clearing business should be handled by commercial companies.    -  Cutbacks on the range of central bank activities, turning  over matters done for policy reasons to banks set up for that  purpose. The People's Bank should no longer handle special  loans, nor should it finance nonbanking financial institutions.  The central bank should actively promote open market business,  gradually increasing the percentage of government bonds among  the central bank's assets. Simultaneous with the government's  halting of overdrafts on the central bank and the establishment  of banks that function for policy purposes, postal savings may  be used as a source of funds for long-term financing for policy  reasons.       (2) Establishment of banks to meet policy needs and the  development of commercial banks.    Vigorous reduction of loans granted for policy reasons,  establishment of banks to meet policy needs, and making loans  granted for policy reasons a part of the system for long-term  policy-related financing.     -    -  Separation of specialized banks' policy purposes business  from its regular business, determining the organizational  structure for specialized banks, and reforming their financial  systems and labor wage systems to make them real commercial  banks.    -  Exercising control over the ratio between assets and  liabilities of commercial banks, as well as controlling assets  risks and liquidity, encouraging commercial banks to engage in  competition, using competition to impel the banks to improve  their services.       (3) The basic tasks in foreign exchange system reform are to  make the renminbi freely convertible within certain limits for  ordinary international current account receipts and expenditures  (including the repatriation of profits from direct investment in  foreign trade, posts and telecommunications, communications, and  transportation); and to reduce administrative interference in  the use of foreign exchange.        -  First is a change in the way in which the central  government uses foreign exchange. Except for foreign exchange  needed for special purposes such as national defense and foreign  exchange, which the state supplies at the posted price, all  foreign exchange to be supplied at the negotiated price.    -  Acceleration of exchange rate reform, merging different  exchange rates into a single one and developing foreign exchange  markets. This should be followed by foreign exchange retention,  exchange rates being allowed to fluctuate, thereby making the  renminbi freely convertible within certain limits for current  accounts.       (4) Separation of the banking and the securities business,  independently supervising and controlling the securities  business.    A) Basic Tasks in Reform of the Investment System and  Steps for Carrying Them Out    (1) Setting up an investment system having different  categories of control.    Construction projects may be divided into three general  categories on the basis of the field of investment, recovery of  investment, and the profits to be made.    First, enterprises and banks should have broader decision  making authority about investment in competitive industrial  sectors and in the tertiary industries field, a "declaration  system" ultimately replacing the "examination and approval  system." The government should no longer interfere in investment  activity.    Second, governments at all levels should continue to include  in their fiscal budgets money for investment in public services  and facilities of a nonproductive nature such as the building of  schools, hospitals, and cultural facilities. Government  authorities in charge should continue to exercise direct control  over such investment.    Third, the government should provide policy-related credit  for infrastructure and for investment in basic industries and  the sophisticated technology sector, as well as for regional  development. Such investment credit, which has a bearing on the  economy of the whole country, should be made a part of the  nation's policy-related long-term financing system. Banks that  have been set up to meet policy needs should exercise control in  accordance with state regional development plans and industrial  policy.    (2) Bearing in mind existing conditions and possibilities,  energies should be concentrated, first of all, on reforming the  state policy-related long-term investment credit system.    Investment in the first category cited above [i.e., in  industry and tertiary industries] accounts for more than  three-fourths of all investment; however, rationalizing this  investment activity will ultimately require changing enterprise  equity rights, building a standardized taxation system, and  perfecting the finance and banking system.    Prominent problems existing today in state construction and  development investment that the central government regulates and  controls directly, and in the credit field are mainly the  following: Lack of investment responsibility and a mechanism for  limiting risk; a shortage of funds, the central government  having insufficient ability to regulate; a problem-plagued fund  raising, fund use, and fund administration system; and the  central bank and the specialized banks getting into  policy-related credit, which injures monetary policy, lowers the  efficiency of the specialized banks, and gets in the way of  finance and banking system reform.    Unlike first category investment activities, state directly  regulated and controlled capital construction cannot  automatically improve as reforms in other fields intensify.  Thus, it is both necessary and possible to begin at once to  reform state long-term policy-related credit and the credit  system so as to solve current extremely serious structural  problems, and to set the stage for reforms in other fields.    (3) Basic tasks in reforming the state-policy-related  long-term investment credit system        -  Beginning to build an investment decision making and  risk limiting mechanism that links rights and responsibilities,  completely changing the present operating mechanism in which  rights and responsibilities are separate and government  administrative agencies directly interfere excessively in  investment.    Establishment of a development bank. The basic function of a  development bank is to issue medium- and long-term credit for  investment in infrastructure, basic industries, newly emerging  leading industries, and regional development, using state long-  term economic development plans and industrial policy as a  guide. A development bank provides preferential interest rates  for projects producing a marked public benefit for which the  investment recovery period is long and economic benefits low.  Development bank funds may not be invested in equity shares.    %Widening of sources of policy-related long-term credit  funds, soaking up idle capital in society to improve the central  government's ability to guide investment activity and readjust  the investment structure.    %The main source of development bank funds is the issuance  of  bonds. The treasury should arrange construction fund purchases  of long-term low interest or interest-free debentures. The state  should direct that postal savings and social security fund  surpluses, and insurance company surpluses must be used to  purchase regular interest rate development bank finance bonds.  The state should also adopt policies to encourage financial  institutions and individual to purchase development bank bonds,  financial institutions being able to use the development bank  bonds they hold as collateral for People's Bank loans. Guided by  state macroeconomic plans and controls on the scale of credit,  the development bank should set up a credit project evaluation  and examination system, a control system, and operating  procedures that link control over the ratio between assets and  liabilities and control over assets risks.       A) Attendant Reform of Planning Work    The task in planning is comprehensive balance and the  formulation of industrial policies. Reform of the macroeconomic  regulation and control system poses a need for a high order of  comprehensive balance in planning work, and the ingredients of  industrial policy should also be changed. Once the pricing  system, the taxation system, and the fiscal system have taken  care of the market signals problem and the distortions of  benefit relationships, there will be no further need for  excessively biased industrial policies. Nor will frequent  artificial tinkering with the various market parameters be  needed. The main ingredient in industrial policy, which consists  primarily of functional policies that improve the overall  quality of the economy, is improvement of social and economic  infrastructure, the fostering of management, technology, and  planning, and the simultaneous adoption of export-oriented trade  policies to bring about an optimization of the structure through  the melding of the domestic economy with the international  economy. In addition, industrial policy must pay close attention  to the development of one or two leading industries, tilting  policies in their favor to an appropriate degree to stimulate an  upgrading of the industrial structure. One important means for  implementing industrial policy is policy-related long-term  financing. Planning units should accelerate reforms in the  following several regards:        -  In the investment control realm, as system reform  intensifies, and the mechanism for restraining investment  entities grows stronger, planning units should curtail the  examination and approval of routine investment projects,  gradually substituting a "declaration system" for the  "examination and approval system." In the process of building a  development bank, the planning sector should work together with  the fiscal and banking sectors to make appropriate readjustments:    -  State use of foreign exchange, no longer employing planning  quotas, for gradual institution of an exchange purchase system.    -  Large scale cutbacks in various licensing systems to promote  implementation of trade policies.    -  Make vocational training an important part of planning  work   <H3>    4. The Different Roles of All Sectors in the Macroeconomic  Regulation and Control System in the Building of a Socialist  Market Economy System </H3>   First, fiscal system reform is the most important  task in the establishment of a new system. It should be given  priority consideration in the building of systems.    The taxation system is the most basic institutional  framework  for a market economy. Therefore, only from the foundation of a  standard tax system can a market economy be built in which  competition is equal, resources are allocated effectively, and  distributions are relatively fair.    Second, the urgency of finance and banking system  reform is manifested, first of all, in the ability of the  central bank's macroeconomic regulation and control to ensure  economic stability. The finance and banking system has two basic  functions in a market economy. One is to regulate and control  the money supply through the central bank to ensure economic  stability. The current economic situation suggests that this  reform should be accelerated. The second is to provide a  well-developed financing system for economic activity to promote  growth and increase returns. The entire financial markets system  must steadily develop and improve with the development of  China's market economy. Therefore, reform and perfection of the  entire finance and banking system is a fairly long-term task.    Third, In overall terms, reform of the investment  system cannot be achieved within the investment system alone. As  reform of the enterprise system, and of tax and finance and  banking institutions proceeds, and as the functions of  government organs change, transformation of the investment  system will become easier to achieve. However, a state  policy-related long-term investment credit system must and can  be inaugurated as early as possible, both to help solve glaring  structural problems in the present economy, and to set the stage  for reforms in other regards.    The foregoing analysis does not mean by any means that these  reforms should be carried out alone. Each system has different  functions, but overall integration is necessary in the process  of conduction reform.  <H3>  5. Reform of the State-Owned Assets Control System, Building  a State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure in Which the State  Holds Shares Indirectly and Directly Control Shares as a  National Legal Entity </H3>   A) Fundamental Reform of State-Owned Enterprises Must  Begin With the Enterprise Equity Rights System.    Since the beginning of reform and opening to the outside  world, China has adopted a series of enterprise reform measures  that have brought definite results. The face of state-owned  enterprises has changed very greatly. Nevertheless, it must be  realized that no fundamental changes have been made in the  situation of no clarification of the equity rights of  state-owned enterprises, no separation of government  administration and enterprise management, no clear-cut  responsibilities, and enterprise mechanisms that do not operate  smoothly, not very high vitality, and not very good returns.    There are another two steadily growing tendencies that  require very close attention. One is that large quantities of  state- owned assets are being drained away through various open  and hidden means. State-owned assets have become the most  important sources of sudden wealth for small groups,  individuals, and foreign investors. This draining away is a  redistribution of wealth that is very unfair and that may lead  to social unrest. Second, enterprises living off of their  capital, technological stagnation, and inadequate development  stamina will seriously impair upgrading of the entire national  economic structure and international competitiveness. This is  because China' energy, raw and processed materials, and heavy  chemical industries, and the key industries that provide  mechanical equipment are still its large- and medium-sized  enterprises. Looked at in these terms, ability to completely  turn around the current trend in state-owned enterprises is a  matter that affects the basic strength of China's economy and  its long-range development prospects.    Therefore, enterprise reform must explore new approaches. It  cannot just work within the existing management system, or  continue simply to take actions that delegate authority and make  concessions. It must solve problems at their source. It must  reform the existing state-owned assets control system and  operating methods, rebuilding the publicly owned equity rights  system.    B) The Key to State-Owned Assets Control System Reform  Lies in Rebuilding the State-Owned Enterprise Equity Rights  Structure, the Main Objects of Reform Being State-Owned Large-  and Medium-Sized Enterprises    (1) Two basic principles must be adhered to in the  rebuilding  of the state-owned enterprise equity structure.    First, is the principle of clear-cut equity rights and the  separation of government administration and enterprise  management, using the formation of state holding companies to  create juridical organizations, and using share control and  share participation to separate state-owned enterprise ownership  rights from governments at all levels. This means the building  of a new equity rights structure, demolishing the mechanism  whereby government directly interferes in the operation of  state-owned enterprises.    Second, is the principle of demolishing industry monopolies  and the diversification of equity rights. In founding state  holding companies that hold state-owned enterprise shares, the  formation of new industrial monopolies must be guarded against.  Administrative monopolies exist in the traditional system,  government departments monopolizing major decisions in  enterprises. If we simply trade the former government units in  charge for industrial corporations, these corporations managing  and administering the state-owned enterprises in those  industries, we will end up in a new kind of industrial monopoly.  This will distort market signals and enterprise actions, thereby  lowering the efficiency of the market economy. The harm will be  no less than that of the administrative monopoly in the  traditional system. Therefore, we must carefully design control  organs for the new state-owned enterprise juridical entities,  institute the swapping of share holdings, and diversify equity  rights to prevent a national holding company from monopolizing  an industry.    (2) The key to reform lies in changing the equity rights  structure of state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises.    Most medium and small state-owned enterprises may be found  in  the ordinary industrial sector and in tertiary industries. In a  socialist market economy, there is no need for state ownership  of these enterprises. Furthermore, as a practical matter, these  enterprises can fairly easily clarify anew their equity rights  relationship through leasing, mergers, joint ventures, and sale,  becoming market entities that make their own operating decisions  and are responsible for their own profits and losses.    The difficulty in reforming the state-owned enterprise  equity  rights system lies in how to establish a state-owned large and  medium size enterprise equity rights structure that is both  consistent with requirements of the market economy, and also  does not change the character of ownership. In reality, China's  state-owned large and medium size enterprises hold a dominant  position in terms of infrastructure and as basic industries.  They are also in the leading sectors of the national economy.  These sectors are technology and capital intensive. They are  also characterized by marked economies of scale and substantial  investment risk. They have a bearing on the national economy and  the people's livelihood. This is not a field suited to the  investment of private capital. State-owned enterprises will  still have to play a major role in these sectors. Therefore,  finding a new state-owned enterprise form for state-owned  enterprises in these fields has become a problem in urgent need  of solution.    C) Theoretical Basis for the Building of a State-Owned  Enterprise Equity Structure and Basic Goals    Basic economic theory holds that independent equity rights  are the foundation for operation of a market economy. The key to  reform of the state-owned assets control system means building a  form of ownership having independent equity.    The development of modern share corporations and their  juridical entity control structure have greatly enriched equity  concepts. It has given rise to equity mechanisms in which the  ultimate ownership rights and the occupancy rights, control  rights, and operating rights that derive from them are mutually  separate and mutual restricting. Operating rights are held by  enterprise management teams who are responsible for the  enterprise's day-to-day operation and decisions. Control rights  are held by the board of directors. They include the appointment  and payment of compensation to management teams, and decisions  on the enterprise's important development strategies. Occupancy  rights belong to the enterprise's juridical entity. As the  occupier of all enterprise assets, it is responsible for  indebtedness. It can mortgage and lease, and it bears all  losses. Ownership rights are held by all shareholders. Their  rights include the right to earnings, and to make strategic  decisions through shareholder meeting approvals of the board of  directors. So called separate equity rights means the  separation, independence, and mutual limitation of the foregoing  four kinds of rights.    In view of basic economic theory in conjunction with  practice  in reform of the country's enterprises and foreign experience in  state-owned assets control, we believe the basic goals of  state-owned assets control system reform to be the building of a  new state-owned assets equity structure. Broadly speaking, this  includes a structure having the following four levels:    First, ultimate ownership of state-owned assets is in the  hands of the state.    Second, the state (an NPC Standing Committee-empowered  agency) controls the equity rights (state directly controlled  shares) of national level holding corporations through full  funding, control of shares, and share participation.    Third, in their status as independent juridical entities,  state holding corporations employ share control or share  participation to control state-owned enterprise equity rights  (juridical entity directly controlled shares).    Fourth, as independent juridical entities actually holding  state-owned assets, the managers of enterprises possess decision  making authority for day-to-day operations.    Such a structure in which the state holds shares indirectly  and a juridical entity directly holds shares does not change the  dominant position of public ownership in terms of ultimate  ownership rights. However, it does permit a separation of  state-owned assets control functions and operating functions.  Thus it builds mutually restricting ownership rights, control  rights, occupancy rights, and operating rights, thereby enabling  a genuine separation of government administration and enterprise  management that enables state-owned enterprises to become market  entities that make their own operating decisions, and are  responsible for their own profits and losses.    D) Ideas About the Specific Make-Up of a State-Owned  Indirect Shareholding, Public Juridical Entity Direct (Swapped)  Shareholding Plan    First, the members of the public ownership system committee  established under the NPC Standing Committee are elected by the  NPC Standing Committee. The public ownership system committee  acts as the ultimate personification of state-owned assets, or  what might be termed the ultimate board of directors for all  state-owned assets. The public ownership system committee has  authority to select members of the board of directors of  national holding corporations on the basis of their special  skills and the achievements of national holding companies. The  work of the committee is subject to supervision of the NPC  Standing Committee and the electorate.    Second is the building of multiple national level holding  companies. During the period when national level holding  companies are being created, the committee will appropriate some  state-owned assets to the holding companies or give each of the  holding companies a substantial amount of equity rights  distribution certificates to be used for the purchase of  state-owned assets. This will serve as a means whereby the  public ownership system committee invests in national level  holding companies, the state-owned system committee using full  funding or share control to get possession of national level  holding companies. It will appoint members of the board of  directors of national level holding companies.    Two methods may be used to demolish industrial monopolies  and  diversify equity rights at the time when national level holding  companies are founded. Method number one is the establishment in  each sector of a national level industrial holding company,  administrative means used to allocate one-third of the equity  rights of state-owned enterprises in that industry to the  national level holding company in that industry. Then the  national level holding company limits the percentage of total  shares sold that enterprises whose shares it controls might  hold. The remaining two-thirds of equity rights is given to the  national level holding company for that industry. Method number  two is the establishment of several comprehensive national level  holding companies, the public ownership system committee giving  each holding company a sufficient amount of share equity  distribution certificates. The public ownership committee places  a limit on the percentage of shares it controls in any single  industry, and it allows holding companies to freely choose the  purchase equity in state-owned enterprises in different  industries. This method first requires first that all  state-owned enterprises change to the share system.    Third, as independent juridical personae, national level  holding companies might use share control and participating  shares to maintain or obtain equity in state-owned enterprises  having independent corporate status.    Simultaneous with holding companies swapping of their  holdings of state-owned enterprise equity rights, each  enterprise also has a certain percentage of equity that can be  held by other juridical persons or private individuals. Thus a  diversification of enterprise equity occurs that helps start the  establishment of a competitive corporate structure.    E) Several Main Tasks in the Transformation of the  State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure    (1) Transformation of shares in existing large- and  medium-sized state-owned enterprises. First of all, an inventory  of assets is required to determine the amount and value of  enterprise assets. The enterprise's assets are then represented  by capital stock that is divided into various shares, and the  enterprise's juridical corporate status decided upon. Only after  this is done cam the national holding company buy equity in the  enterprise for the formation of a controlling share or  participating share relationship. At the same time, shares are  openly offered to attract capital from other juridical persons  and private individuals.    (2) Selection of methods for founding national level holding  companies. Generally speaking, national level holding companies  might be newly founded, or existing banks, insurance companies,  funds, and investment corporations might be made into holding  companies. Several different choices exist in the actual  founding process:    One proposal is to prohibit banking institutions from  holding  shares. This is because even though the source of banks'  shareholding funds is not savings but administratively allocated  equity rights or equity rights distribution certificates,  nevertheless, should recovery of capital invested in  shareholdintgs become impossible, the banks would be at  considerable risk. Should a crisis occur at a participating  share enterprise, the banks stability would be shaken. Thus, it  has been proposed that national level holding companies be  founded by personnel drawn from the former Ministry of Industry.  However, in order to guard against industrial monopolies, most  of the equity rights of formerly subordinate enterprises would  be dispersed into other shareholding companies. Another proposal  is for all national level holding companies to be financial  institutions. State-owned enterprises throughout the country are  generally fairly heavily in debt to banks. If they held shares,  banks could swap indebtedness for equity, thereby solving the  enterprise indebtedness problem while simultaneously making  banks shareholders. In addition, large corporate blocs generally  mostly exercise financial control over subordinate companies, so  bank share holdings would help the development of large  entrepreneurial blocs around banks. We believe both methods  might be mixed.    (3) Founding of second level national holding companies.  China has more than 1,000 large- and medium-sized state-owned  enterprises under central government control. Nationwide,  large- and medium-sized state-owned enterprises number in the  thousands. The founding of only 10-odd primary level national  holding companies would scarcely suffice to complete the  restructuring of the ownership of state-owned enterprises. Thus,  the founding of second level national holding companies is  needed. First level holding companies might hold equity in  second level holding companies, and second level holding  companies might also swap shareholdings among each other. Second  level holding companies could also hold equity in enterprises.  They would be like the presently existing entrepreneurial block  companies.    (4) Selection of methods for the swapping of share holdings  between national holding companies and enterprises. One method  is a pyramidal ownership structure. This means a share holding  relationship with swaps only downward and sideways. This means  that the holding company at the top of the pyramid would have  substantial authority and control capabilities, while second  level national holding companies as the core could easily spawn  numerous large entrepreneurial blocs. Through its control of  shares, the state would wield tremendous economic power. Another  method is the network ownership structure in which swaps could  be made either laterally or vertically. A necessary precondition  is fairly centralized equity in national holding companies,  particularly in second level holding companies, enterprises also  being able to hold equity in national holding companies. This is  the kind of structure for the swapping of share holdings among  juridical entities in Japan. We believe a rather appropriate  method would be to use the first method for the most part. Later  on, control could be gradually loosened, a title made toward the  second method. Adoption of this transitional method includes an  assumption that initially the state will provide full funding  for the national holding company's equity. Then later on,  depending on the spread of individual holding company equity in  different industries and fields, such as ordinary industries and  the tertiary industry field, a change can be made gradually  toward a form of holding in which state control of shares and  share participation is paramount.    (5) Associated Government Agency Reform    Establishment of national holding companies, separating  enterprises from direct government control, requires  simultaneous reform of government agencies to bring about a  genuine transformation of government functions.    All industrial departments in charge must be basically  eliminated. Those departments that have been in charge of  industrial planning and administration may be a part of the  Economic Relations and Trade Committee once they have been  reduced in size. The Economic Relations and Trade Committee will  be responsible for functions similar to those of Japan's  Ministry of International Trade and Industry [MITI]. As a  transitional organization, once personnel cutbacks have been  made, it may regain administrative organs for basic industries  and sophisticated and strategic industries such as energy,  communications, aviation, and shipping.    Founding of a large three-in-one fiscal mechanism made up of  public finance, taxation, and national assets. The Ministry of  Finance should abolish departments and bureaus in charge of  enterprises' financial matters. It should reform the existing  system of direct control over the finances of state-owned  enterprises, changing to indirect control methods made up  primarily of income tax collection, and supervision of returns  from state-owned assets. Correspondingly, the fiscal budget  should be changed to a three account form consisting of  recurring, construction, and capital accounts. The basic  functions of the State Administration of State Property are  administrative supervision of state-owned assets, protection of  the rights of enterprises as juridical persons, and to examine,  verify, and coordinate.    Establishment of a public ownership system committee chosen  by the NPC to serve as the ultimate board of directors for  state-owned assets. Not only will it appoint members of the  National level holding company board of directors, but it will  also decide national investment, empowerment, and the taking  back of empowerment.    (6) Founding of mechanism for the circulation and transfer  of  juridical entity equity for the fashioning of market competition  among public juridical entities and among other juridical  entities.    Thus, after state-owned enterprises have been turned into  stock companies, more limited liability companies will have to  be set up and listed for exchange when conditions warrant. In  addition, a juridical entity equity exchange organ must be  established. A negotiable securities exchange must also be  established for gradual expansion of the number of juridical  entity shares listed. This is to promote the circulation and  transfer of juridical entity equity for optimum allocation of  resources.    Public juridical entity equity exchanges must also include  second level national holding companies. An equity exchange  percentage may be set, fluctuations in share price becoming an  important indicator for holding companies. In addition, this  will also stimulate holding companies more, which is good for  competition.    (7) Transformation of the local state-owned enterprise  equity  system. Local state-owned enterprises or a portion of them may  be designated for local public ownership. Alternatively, the NPC  Standing Committee may empower local people's congress standing  committees to set up local public ownership committees as  plenipotentiaries for local state-owned Assets. Local  state-owned equity organizations may be rebuilt using the  methods explained above. This could accelerate the conversion  process nationwide.    However, consideration also should be given to the founding  of an equity relationship for swapping of local state-owned  equity between the central government and local governments, and  among local governments. A minimum amount of sales should be set  to improve the effective allocation of key resources within the  market nationwide.    F) Sequence and Steps in the Transformation of the  State-Owned Enterprise Equity Structure    The first step is a wide-ranging inventory of the assets of  state-owned large- and medium-sized enterprises to speed up and  widen the process of changing enterprises to a stock system.  This means issuing capital stock for enterprise assets, dividing  the stock into shares, and determining enterprises' juridical  corporate status.    The second step is setting up national level (or bi-level)  holding companies, selecting existing banks, insurance  companies, funds, and investment corporations for conversion to  holding companies.    The third step is reforming government agencies, share  companies dividing up equity rights at the same time, swapping  holdings, and beginning open share subscription.    The fourth step is listing of share corporations as  conditions warrant, and beginning equity trading in securities  exchanges to advance optimum allocation of publicly owned equity.    Reform of the state-owned property control system is an  enormous piece of systems engineering that ramifies into all  parts of the economy. It requires painstaking planning and  long-term preparation. Therefore, we should begin to do it as  soon as possible, learn as we go, and gradually move ahead. One  fairly safe way to proceed is to select several sectors, and one  or two cities as pilot projects. This will both help summarize  experiences as work proceeds to make revisions and improvements,  and will also reduce social shock.</p>

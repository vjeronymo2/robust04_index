			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Leading Article: Polish deal THE INTERNATIONAL Monetary Fund has tacitly passed over Poland's inability to cut its budget deficit this year and agreed a new letter of intent, thus showing its faith in the government's ability to restrain spending and raise tax revenues in 1993. The deal is excellent news for Poland. At the same time, it places a good deal of responsibility on the Polish parliament, which has previously rejected government demands for a cut in pensions and other social payments. These cuts will be essential, however, if Poland is to honour next year's agreed budget deficit limit of 5.1 per cent of GDP. Simultaneously, the Polish government, just like the governments of other 'fast-track' reforming countries of central Europe, must put high priority on the introduction of modern income and value-added tax systems, in order to replace the primitive turnover and profit tax systems inherited from the communist past. Given progress on both fronts, Poland should be able to cut spending and raise tax revenue sufficiently to meet the new IMF target, particularly against the background of a recovery in industrial output and a strong balance of payments. But hopes of recovery also depend on the state of the German and other EC economies next year. EC governments must allow east and central European countries such as Poland to increase their exports, without the sort of anti-dumping action invoked recently in the case of steel pipe imports. Agreement on the new Dollars 660m IMF loan arrangement for Poland is important to Polish recovery in several ways. Warsaw needs the IMF seal of approval before Poland's official creditors can proceed with the second stage of the overall 50 per cent reduction in official debt agreed in March 1991. Just as important, an IMF agreement should pave the way for a resumption of negotiations with Poland's private bank creditors, to whom it owes around Dollars 12bn. Many commercial banks, who have received only Dollars 100m in interest since the autumn of 1989, were unhappy with the terms of the official debt reduction. In particular, they will be seeking to recoup as much as possible of the Dollars 3bn unpaid interest which has accumulated over the years. Poland's inability to settle with its bank creditors remains a big obstacle to the foreign equity investment that Poland needs. Once the IMF deal is finalised, Warsaw should waste no time in seeking a reasonable deal from the banks.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Parkin, PRESS ASSOCIATION] </F>   [Text] Next week's Anglo-Irish summit in London will  concentrate on reviewing the joint bid for peace in Northern  Ireland, Dublin premier Albert Reynolds said today.    Mr Reynolds, due to meet John Major when both attend the  February 19 England-Ireland rugby fixture at Twickenham, said  the talks would involve Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and  Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring.    "The meeting will be a question of monitoring the situation  relating to the Downing Street peace declaration, updating  ourselves as to where it's at and having a general review of the  progress of the declaration," he told the Dublin parliament.    Mr Reynolds, who on Monday [7 February] night received  British proposals for resuming inter-party negotiations on  Northern Ireland's future, said ministers from the two  governments would consider how they could proceed to the next  stage of the talks that stalled well over a year ago.    He insisted there was no "conflict or competition" between  last year's December 15 peace statement and the British attempt  to restart the talks.    "I do not see the peace declaration standing in the way of  talks. I believe it gives the talks process a greater chance of  success. There is now a new starting point because of the  declaration."    Mr Spring said today the proposals received from Britain  contained "a checklist of relevant points in relation to the  recommencement of the talks process."    Mr Reynolds rejected calls in the Dail to publish details of  his correspondence with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams.    He refused to depart from "a long-established tradition of  confidentiality" regarding communications involving the head of  government.    The premier said he sent a detailed letter to Mr Adams,  backed up by a memorandum, in reply to a request for  clarification of the Downing Street declaration.    "I have provided as much explanation and clarification as  possible."    Mr Reynolds said he looked forward to an early response from  the IRA and its Sinn Fein political spokesmen to the peace  initiative.    While no deadline had been set, a lot of attention would  naturally focus on Sinn Fein's annual conference in Dublin at  the end of the month, he added.    He brushed aside opposition criticism of Dublin's attitude  towards the granting by the US of a visa permitting Mr Adams to  speak in America last week.    "The American administration took the decision and that was  that. We don't get involved in trying to tell foreign  administrations what kind of decisions to take."    Sinn Fein today put the blame for their slow response to the  declaration on the [British] Government.    Party chairman Tom Hartley condemned London's "continued  stubborn refusal" to clarify the declaration.    He said that in contrast to Britain's inflexibility, the  Dublin government acted responsibly in the matter and its  efforts were welcome and helpful.    "If John Major is serious about constructing a real peace  process he should follow the lead given by Albert Reynolds,  rather than pursuing the tried and failed policy of partition."    Mr Hartley said long-overdue clarification would allow every  one to make a judgment of the London-Dublin plan. "Britain's  refusal to do so is unnecessarily delaying our process of  consultation and consideration."    Sir Patrick tonight emphasised the Government's  determination  to defeat terrorism.    "We shall continue to provide the security forces with the  resources they need to bring those guilty of terrorist crime to  account through the due process of law," he said during a visit  to police and Army bases in north Belfast.</p>

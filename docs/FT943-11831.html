			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / Observer: Lifer Some people are never satisfied. Apparently not fully stretched in his role scrutinising the glamorous world of building societies, Robert Villiers, analyst at UBS, has released a dance CD single and video. Mr V, as he bills himself, can obviously put this sort of thing together with the facility of a teenage scribbler accustomed to deadlines. 'I knocked it off in an afternoon' he tells Observer unassumingly. Still, outings for his oeuvre on Radio 1 and Kiss FM have not gone to his head, and he will admit to no immediate plans for chucking in the day job. The title of the single, 'Give me life', is impressively ambiguous however. Does it betray a secret wish to escape from his current position or should it be read as a plea for an extended sentence?</p>

			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE;  </P> <P> 2 SUSPECTS HELD IN AUTO THEFT CASE  </P> <P> Two San Francisco Bay Area residents suspected of stealing a car, a wallet full  of credit cards and at least one blank check taken from a Laguna Hills business  have been arrested, authorities said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Kimberly Dawn Masincup, 23, of San Mateo, and Yarub Marwan Taher, 27, of San  Francisco, were being held on $10,000 bail each at Orange County Jail,  Sheriff's Department Lt. Richard J. Olson said.  </P> <P> The pair were scheduled to appear today for arraignment on auto theft and  possession of stolen property charges at Harbor Municipal Court, Olson said.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Angel Johnson said that two CHP officers riding north along the San  Diego Freeway about 11 p.m. Tuesday saw a car idling on the freeway emergency  lane south of the Culver Drive off-ramp.  </P> <P> "They thought it was a disabled vehicle," Johnson said.  </P> <P> But as the patrol car pulled up, the driver sped off, she said. A short chase  ensued and then the car, reported stolen Sept. 15 from a Dollar Rent-a-Car lot  in San Francisco, turned off at Culver Drive and stopped, she said.  </P> <P> The two were arrested without incident, Johnson said. A search of the car after  the arrests also turned up four credit cards believed stolen and two blank  checks, one of which has been confirmed stolen, she said.  </P> <P> Investigators were looking into whether a blank check from a Los Angeles  business was stolen. In addition, a video recorder, believed bought with one of  the credit cards, was discovered in the car.  </P> <P> Johnson said the pair appeared to have been heading north to San Francisco when  they were stopped.

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RITE AID DRUG PRESIDENT PLEADS INNOCENT TO BRIBERY CHARGES  </P> <P> The president of Rite Aid Corp., the nation's largest drugstore chain, pleaded  innocent today to charges that he bribed a state Pharmacy Board member, and the  case was assigned to a judge who previously issued rulings favorable to Rite  Aid.  </P> <P> Martin Grass, 35, did not speak during his arraignment before Cuyahoga County  Common Pleas Judge Jose Villanueva; his plea was entered by his lawyer.  </P> <P> Grass and the corporation are charged with one count each of bribery and  possession of criminal tools -- the corporate jet on which Grass flew to meet  Pharmacy Board member Melvin Wilczynski of Toledo at Cleveland Hopkins  International Airport on April 27.  </P> <P> Grass was arrested after sheriff's deputies videotaped his meeting with  Wilczynski at a nearby hotel.  </P> <P> Rite Aid has claimed that the $33,000 check for Wilczynski represented money  that the Shiremanstown, Pa., drugstore chain owed Wilczynski as part of an  agreement with another chain Rite Aid purchased last year.  </P> <P> Ironically, the case was assigned -- by random draw -- to Judge Lillian Greene,  who issued a temporary restraining order earlier this month halting the  processing and service of the indictments on Grass and the corporation, ruling  that they violated a gag order she imposed in June.  </P></p>

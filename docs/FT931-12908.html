			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Pounds 20bn tax rise by late 1990s, warns institute THE UK faces the possibility of tax increases totalling Pounds 20bn over the next few years, according to a report published yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, a research group, in collaboration with US investment bank Goldman Sachs. The study says the extra taxes are needed to combat a 'dramatic worsening' in the UK's finances, mainly brought about by extra social security spending and lower tax income triggered by the recession. As a tax increase in the March 16 Budget would put at risk tentative signs of recovery, the government will probably delay any fiscal tightening until this year's December Budget, which applies to 1994-95 and is part of a new Treasury system for planning fiscal policy and public spending at the same time. The IFS/Goldman Sachs study - called the Green Budget - says the government is likely in December to start clawing back the deficit through tax increases of Pounds 5bn to Pounds 6bn. That could be done by increasing national insurance contributions and by extending the scope of value added tax. If VAT were levied on all items - such as food - which are zero rated, this could raise as much as Pounds 11bn a year. Other possibilities are 'environmental taxes' on carbon-based fuels, higher taxes on savings such as pensions and the end of mortgage tax relief. The Treasury is also likely to look at attracting more private money into normally state-funded projects such as roads and railways. The study says Mr Lamont should try to stimulate a recovery over the next few months by looser monetary policy. Once the recession has clearly ended, the government should start regaining control of public finances through tax increases phased over two or three years. The IFS/Goldman Sachs team thinks the public sector borrowing requirement will be Pounds 38bn in 1992-3, against Treasury projections of Pounds 37bn. It may climb to about Pounds 54bn in 1993-94, significantly more than the Treasury's Pounds 44bn estimate. The study says assuming 3 per cent a year growth is achievable, the Treasury should aim to reduce the PSBR to about 3 per cent of GDP by the mid to late 1990s. Because only modest public spending cuts are likely in this period, that leaves most of the 'black hole' in public finances to be filled by a tax increase of 3 per cent of GDP - about Pounds 20bn.

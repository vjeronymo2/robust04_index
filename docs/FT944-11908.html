			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Survey of UK Consumer Credit and Asset Finance (3): Quiet revolution in marketing strategy - Motor finance / A look at personal contract purchase schemes A quiet revolution is under way in motor financing. In August, around half the new M cars registered will have been sold through a personal contract purchase (PCP) scheme - just over two years since the first national plan was introduced by Ford, the car manufacturer. Sine then, Ford's Options has been joined by schemes from nearly all car manufacturers, including Vauxhall Choices 1-2-3, Rover Select and Peugeot Passport. The schemes are a return to the old-style leasing schemes, but with a significant difference: drivers have the option to purchase the vehicle. Private buyers pay a deposit on a new vehicle, typically anything over a fifth of the value. The dealer will then calculate the future value of the car at the end of the payment period, which can be anything from two to five years. The buyer pays the difference, plus interest, as a monthly payment. At the end of the period the buyer has two options: to buy the vehicle outright, for which the outstanding future value sum must be paid; or to part-exchange the vehicle for another new car. Thus instead of paying the remaining lump sum to own an older car, the buyer trades it in to pay a similar amount for a new one. For the customer this has obvious advantages. It makes a new car more affordable. Monthly payments are lower than with a straight loan or hire purchase where the entire cost of the car is repaid over the term of the agreement. For example, with a PCP, a Rover Metro can be leased for as little as Pounds 25 a week, after the initial deposit. It also means that the customer will have a new car every few years. Another bonus is that often the warranty on the car will mean that many potential repair costs are covered. As well as giving the new car market a shot in the arm, PCPs carry other benefits to the dealers and manufacturers. They promote brand loyalty, encouraging customers to exchange their used cars for new. The manufacturer benefits from the regular servicing and repair of the vehicle plus, at the end of the term, the probability of the customer trading in the old vehicle for a new one of the same make. If the customer does decide to hand back the car, the garage is left with a low mileage - most of PCP schemes limit annual mileage - car, with one owner and which has been serviced regularly, which can then be sold on. But PCPs have not suited all buyers. They are unusually available only on new cars, or sometimes those up to two or three years old. For many buyers, particularly those who do not have an old car to trade in or a lump sum, it is not convenient to find a deposit. It may also not be agreeable to pay a lump sum at the end of the payment period. Another potential drawback is that agreed future values are covered by a variety of clauses, particularly those insisting on the good condition of the car, and mileage limits - usually 6,000 to 12,000 a year. As well as never owning the vehicle outright, drivers are also tied to the same manufacturer every time they change models. However, the overall success and popularity of PCPs is undeniable, to the extent that banks and building societies are changing their product ranges to meet the challenge. Yorkshire Bank, which offers car loans with a typical annual percentage rate (APR) of about 16 per cent, has introduced an HP-style New Car Finance Plan with typical APR of between 10.7 and 11.6 per cent for loans of Pounds 3,000 and above. Midland Bank recently offered its 3m credit card customers Carchoice, in which they could lease a new car from Swan National - the hire company bought by the bank last year - for two years and either return it at the end or buy it outright for an extra fee. There have been other developments in the motor finance sector underpinning the PCP revolution. 'The finance houses and the car dealers have finally got their act together,' says Graham Woodhouse, chief executive of Rover Finance. 'We are at the point of sale so that customers get not only first-class sales service but also the best financial assistance as well.' The result, says Mr Woodhouse, is an improved service and an increase in sales. 'We have increased the number of sales inquiries into actual sales.' This has been achieved through a high investment in new technology at garages. Customers can be informed of terms and conditions for potential purchases on a variety of options within minutes of an inquiry. Neil Tomkins, managing director of Lombard Motor Finance, said: 'Those customers who would have gone to the bank for a loan are now being converted at the point of sale through better training and new technology.' The upgrading of the point of sale has occurred while dealers' margins have declined. With many manufacturers offering cash-back deals on various models, dealers' margins have been cut from around 18 per cent to 10 per cent. According to the Finance and Leasing Association, new car motor finance was up 29 per cent year-on-year for August. 'It's a healthy leap, but the biggest part seems to have happened at the start of the year, and the indications are that sales growth is slowing,' said Mr Woodhouse. But he added: 'We do seem to have recovered the feel-good factor in the industry.'</p>

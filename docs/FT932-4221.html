			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Letter: Labour principles still relevant Sir, The article by Frances Williams, 'Soft bark and not much of a bite' (June 2), betrayed a lack of perspective regarding the influence and role of the International Labour Organisation and gave an unbalanced account of its position and achievements. The ILO is not alone in having to come to terms with the social, economic and political debris left by the communist regimes in central and eastern Europe. But it is worth noting that most of the countries of the region are using ILO conventions as the basis for the development of labour legislation, putting their trust in tripartite consultation and reaffirming commitment to freedom of association in tackling vast economic problems. The ILO alone provides comprehensive accounts of the extent of bonded and child labour, poverty, unemployment, and risks to safety and health round the world which must be the starting point for efforts to eradicate those evils. It alone exposes repressive governments to detailed public scrutiny and cross-questioning about violations of conventions protecting human rights which it authoritatively identifies. From our experience, I know ILO criticisms and condemnations have had some impact even on the UK government, despite a shameless offensive of misrepresentation and disparagement of the organisation on those occasions. Recollection of the catastrophic experience of social breakdown and injustice which led to two wars, to the foundation of the ILO and inspired its development after 1944 seems to be unfashionable now. However, increasingly we see that reputable economic commentators are joining the ILO in exposing the abject failure in economic, as well as social terms, of the Thatcher experiment to show that the values of solidarity, justice, consultation and commitment to gradual social improvement are central to long-term economic success and to peace. There may be just criticism of the ILO for buying uncritically so much of the neo-liberal message and for failing to give a lead in fighting mass unemployment. That, too, in my view, arises from pursuit of a passing fashion; it does not bring any discredit to the principles on which the ILO was founded. They are still relevant and the international community will return to them. Norman Willis, general secretary, Trades Union Congress, Great Russell Street, London WC1B 3LS</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (5): Ripples of the 'bubble boom' - There are signs the property market will soon touch bottom IN EBISU, on the fringe of central Tokyo, the Shinozaki real estate agency is able to find tenants as soon as new apartments surface, and rents are high and still rising. But, in Osaka, Japan's second largest city, developers are struggling to find buyers for apartments whose prices have fallen 40 per cent and are still falling. The downturn in the Japanese property prices over the past two years has been as erratic as the surge in prices during the 1980s, when speculative fever gripped investors, and office buildings, resorts and apartment blocks sprouted in ever more remote areas. There are signs that the market will soon touch bottom, but property companies are agreed that recovery will come gradually and unevenly. Developers say that the rapid build-up of unsold apartments last year has slowed, while estate agents have noted inquiries increasing in tandem with the decrease in interest rates. Housing loan approvals in the October to December quarter rose 29,000 from a year earlier to 131,000. But there are also concerns that the property debt burden inherited by Japanese banks will limit their ability to lend for new investment, and that ill-conceived projects begun before the market downturn will continue to appear on the market, keeping prices and confidence soft for the next year or two. Japanese property, like the stock market, had been regarded as a safe bet in the 1980s, and even when Tokyo prices rose by 76.8 per cent in 1987, the general presumption was that the limited supply of land in the capital would ensure prices could only go higher. Apartment prices in central Tokyo have been flat for virtually the past three years, with a fall of just over 1 per cent last year, and the most widely accepted estimate is that the price of land in Japan has fallen by an average of about 30 per cent over the past two years. Professor Shunsuke Ishihara, chairman of the Association for Real Estate Sciences, reckons that apartment prices in greater Tokyo, including the Yokohama area, have fallen by an average of 20 per cent, while prices in Osaka have fallen by 40 per cent since the market turned sour. Meanwhile, housing starts have fallen from a peak of 1.7m a year in 1990 to 1.37m last year, and the industry expects demand will remain at around 1.3m units for the next few years. 'We simply cannot expect the same sort of development growth as the 1980s, but in the coming four to five years we will see moderate growth of perhaps 4 per cent,' Professor Ishihara said. That is a more modest expectation that the 22.7 per cent growth in apartment starts in 1987. Daikyo, the leading apartment builder, has seen its stock of unsold Tokyo apartments surge from 3,000 in 1990 to 9,000 last year, but said that the scaling down of new construction plans has already slowed the build-up. Demand for the company's new Tokyo apartments had been at around 41,500 a year in 1990, but Mr Katsuhiko Muramoto, Daikyo's deputy-president, said 26,000 apartments a year is a more sustainable level. 'There is still demand for apartments that are reasonably priced and in a good location. One positive effect of the slowdown is that costs have also fallen. Land prices are down about 30 per cent, and the construction cost is now 10 per cent lower than a year ago,' Mr Muramoto said. However, he said that the average price of a two-bedroom, family-style apartment has remained steady at around Y59m, and Daikyo is now aiming at the middle-class buyer with a budget of around Y50m rather than the wealthier client willing to spend Y100m because the demand for luxury apartments has been particularly weak in the past year. The landscape for the office market varies by district, with the Tokyo business district still showing 99 per cent occupancy, but Ikoma Corporation, a commercial real estate broker, estimating that the rate has fallen from 99.7 to 94.5 per cent in the six months to December in one district on the fringe of the city. Mr Ippei Itoh, Ikoma's general manager, said that the market has entered a 'very interesting transition period", and that landlords in softer areas have been forced to be more flexible in negotiating deposits and rents. 'It is still a seller's market in central Tokyo, but prospective tenants are now at least able to negotiate with landlords. In the past, there was a long queue of people wanting space,' Mr Itoh said. He expects that Japanese banks' wariness of the real estate market will limit the number of new projects in the next year, and lead to a gradual soaking up of the space excess: 'The banks are very conscious of their capital adequacy ratios, and they are trying to cope with bad debts now in real estate.' The ministry of finance, concerned at the banks' property exposure, had imposed curbs two years ago on lending for development in the hope of starving speculators of funds. At the same time, banks have had to assist clients by holding land off the market, and restructuring a few of their larger property developer clients. 'We are still feeling the ripples of the bubble boom,' Mr Itoh said.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                           NEW UNIT STARTS  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Year   Total units (m)  % change 1985           1.24          4.1 1986           1.36         10.4 1987           1.67         22.7 1988           1.68          0.69 1989           1.66         -1.3 1990           1.71          2.7 1991           1.37        -19.7  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: FT statistics  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

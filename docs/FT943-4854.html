			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Sizewell B start-up likely in December Nuclear Electric, the state-owned generator, is expected to apply within two weeks for permission to load the first uranium fuel into Sizewell B, Britain's first pressurised-water reactor power station. Staff from the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, who are scrutinising safety systems on the Suffolk site, are expected to give the go-ahead for fuel loading subject to satisfactory completion of outstanding work. Sizewell B, which has been built within its Pounds 2.03bn budget, was expected to begin generating electricity during the summer. However, the complexity of the commissioning process and delay in obtaining authorisation to discharge radioactivity into the environment means the plant is unlikely to be started up before December. The delay has resulted in the failure of Nuclear Electric to meet the commitment it gave the government to build the power station and load fuel within 72 months - that period expired on August 31. Nuclear Electric had set itself a target of 63 months. Officials blame commissioning delays on the fact that, although Sizewell B was modelled on the US Westinghouse design, it is in many respects a prototype. Even if fuel loading goes ahead later this month, the reactor cannot be activated until the pollution inspectorate grants a discharge authorisation. Further complex commissioning procedures also have to be approved by the NII before generation can begin.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Ban for Tory aides caught in Blair office Security at Mr Tony Blair's Westminster office was being tightened yesterday after two Conservative aides caught on the premises by staff were banned from the Commons for seven weeks. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, ordered the removal of security passes issued to the aides - researchers for Mr David Atkinson, Tory MP for Bournemouth East - after a police inquiry into their intrusion into Mr Blair's office on Friday evening. Miss Boothroyd said the inquiry had concluded that the researchers 'abused the privilege' of access to the Commons, but there was 'no malice' in the incident, which reflected 'an excess of seasonal spirits'. The inquiry was set up by Sir Alan Urwick, the Commons Serjeant at Arms, after the two aides and a friend with a day pass were discovered by Ms Sue Jackson, Mr Blair's head of administration, who heard laughter coming from his office. One of the researchers, Mr Andrew Hull, said they had lost their way in the Commons' labyrinthine corridors while returning from a social engagement. He wrote to Mr Blair yesterday, apologising for the incident. Mr Atkinson said the explanation given to him coincided with Miss Boothroyd's judgment that no malice was involved. He said he would consider Mr Hull's future, but would probably regard his suspension as sufficient punishment. Mr Blair, campaigning in Dudley West for tomorrow's by-election, said he was 'concerned' about the incident, and revealed that his staff were checking papers to make sure that nothing had been removed from his office. Labour MPs claimed that the incident was an attempt to acquire sensitive information from Mr Blair's office. Some linked it with a leaked memo to the prime minister from Mr John Maples, a Conservative party vice-chairman, urging an aggressive approach to Labour. 'There is feeling on the Labour benches this is a sort of minor 'Westminstergate' - a deliberate attempt to find out information unofficially from the opposition leader's office,' said Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall South. Ms Hilary Armstrong, a former aide to the late John Smith, said it was 'difficult to give credibility' to Mr Hull's explanation. 'It is an office which is away from the main area of the Commons. There is a long corridor leading to it, and 'Leader of the Opposition' is emblazoned above the door that leads into the suite of offices,' she told BBC Radio. Other Labour MPs called for tighter controls on researchers, whose numbers have increased greatly in recent years in spite of attempts by the Commons authorities to impose limits. Some MPs have employed as many as five unpaid or poorly paid researchers at a time. Many are politics students - often from the US - eager to gain experience for academic purposes or as the foundation for a political career. Earlier complaints prompted a limit of one researcher for most backbench MPs, but senior backbenchers and frontbenchers are allowed two or more, by negotiation with the Commons authorities. As a result, several hundred researchers have privileged access to the Commons, including areas such as the library, closed to most other passholders except MPs themselves.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Doubtful opinion Sir, As someone with a high regard for your newspaper, I am dismayed that you have advertised the opinion of central bankers, finance ministry officials and financial executives who regard yours as the publication that most influences them ('The FT influence', October 10). I would not stake my reputation on the mess created by these gentlemen. J Toporowski, South Bank University, 103 Borough Road, London SE1 0AA</p>

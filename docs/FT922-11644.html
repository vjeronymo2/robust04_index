			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / International Company News: Acquisitions help boost sales by 23.7% at Sasib SASIB, the diversified precision engineering group controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti's CIR holding company, raised net group profits by 4.3 per cent to L73.2bn (Dollars 59.22m) last year, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. Consolidated sales at the group jumped by 23.7 per cent to L766.6bn due to a continuing acquisitions drive. Adjusted for new purchases, sales rose 5.3 per cent last year. The company, which produces food processing equipment and railway signalling technology with its original business of building cigarette-making machines, is paying an unchanged dividend of L230 for ordinary shares and L250 for savings shares. Mr Gian Carlo Vaccari, managing director, said Sasib owned almost 3.2 per cent of Credito Romagnolo, the big Bologna-based bank which recently raised to 10 per cent the limit on the the size of stakes which could be held by individual shareholders. In October, Sasib owned only 1.85 per cent of the bank.</p>

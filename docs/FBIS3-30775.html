Baudys confirmed that by the end of 1995 the Czech Army  would  reach its final size -- 65,000 troops. He said, however, that  further decrease in the army size was not being considered thus  far because, Baudys said, following the euphoria after the fall  of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet bloc, "a more  realistic standpoint is gaining the upper hand and the  restriction of armed forces in individual countries is coming to  a halt." He added that the share of military expenditures in  the state budgets of a number of European countries has begun to  grow again.</p>

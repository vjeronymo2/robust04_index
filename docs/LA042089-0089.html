			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> REDONDO OPTS FOR OWN UNIFIED SCHOOL SYSTEM  </P> <P> In a surprise move that could accelerate unification of school districts in  three beach cities, the Redondo Beach school board has decided to form its own  kindergarten-through-12th-grade system.  </P> <P> The 4-1 decision Tuesday apparently closes the door on proposals to form a  single large district by consolidating elementary schools in Redondo Beach,  Manhattan Beach and Hermosa Beach with the South Bay Union High School  District.  </P> <P> If successful, the Redondo Beach plan would lead to the dissolution of the high  school district that serves the three cities. Redondo Beach would take over  Redondo Union High School, leaving Manhattan Beach to form a separate K-12  district around the grade schools in that city and its local high school, Mira  Costa.  </P> <P> The small district in Hermosa Beach would merge its single elementary school  with one of the new unified systems. Redondo Beach, in mapping out its own  plan, formally invited Hermosa Beach to join.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Control Our Destiny'  </P> <P> "It's time to move forward," Redondo Beach board President Rebecca Sargent said  Wednesday. "We have a great opportunity here to control our own destiny. We  will be able to continue the programs that we believe are best for our  children."  </P> <P> Sargent said the board has all the information it needs on the unification  issue and is confident that most residents want to maintain local control  rather than become part of a larger school system.  </P> <P> Supt. Nick Parras said Wednesday that he expects to come up with a detailed  unification plan by fall. After public hearings, the plan would be converted to  a petition that would have to be signed by at least 25% of the city's  registered voters to qualify for review by county and state agencies. Hermosa  Beach voters would be included if that city decides to join the new Redondo  Beach school system, he said.  </P> <P> In Hermosa Beach, Supt. Shalee Cunningham said her board wants to keep its  options open until "we get more input from the community." She said a survey  will be started next week.  </P> <P> "We graduate about 100 students a year, and most of them go to Redondo Union,"  she said. "There's a tremendous loyalty to that school."  </P> <P> The final step in the unification process is a vote in the affected  communities, which presumably would be the three beach cities. Parras said such  an election could occur as early as fall, 1990, and a new, unified district  could begin operations a year later.  </P> <P> Trustee Sylvia Zellers cast the only vote against Redondo Beach going it alone.  She said a larger school system would provide more educational advantages.  </P> <P> Noel Palm, president of the high school district, said he was surprised by  Redondo Beach's abrupt decision to break off discussions with the other  districts. The talks began in January, at the high school district's behest,  and expanded into several public hearings.  </P> <P> Last week, the boards of the four districts tentatively agreed to hire a  consultant to study the pros and cons of a single, 10,000-student system.  </P> <P> "At this point, we don't know where this is going," Palm said. "It's out of our  hands."  </P> <P> If the district is split between Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach, Palm said,  Mira Costa will lose about one-third of its students, making it too small to  continue many of the elective programs offered there and at Redondo Union.  Students lost by Mira Costa would go to Redondo Union, where enrollment would  rise to about 2,000, he said.  </P> <P> Each school now has about 1,500 students, but that level at Mira Costa has been  maintained by assigning 400 to 500 Redondo Beach students to the campus in  Manhattan Beach, he said.  </P> <P> "We're used to thinking about the welfare of students in all three cities,"  Palm said. "We're concerned that splitting the (high school) district will not  be in the best interests of some students."  </P> <P> Enrollment in all the districts has fallen sharply in the last 15 to 20 years.  Unification has been proposed in the past, but the movement this year is the  first that appears almost certain to result in mergers.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GOP ELECTS GINGRICH AS HOUSE WHIP;  </P> <P> CONFRONTATIONAL CONSERVATIVE WINS PARTY'S NO. 2 POST  </P> <P> Frustrated by decades of Democratic domination, House Republicans on Wednesday  elected confrontational conservative Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia to their  second-ranking leadership post, over the opposition of House Republican leader  Robert H. Michel of Illinois.  </P> <P> Backers of Gingrich said his 87-85 victory over the more traditional and less  colorful Rep. Edward R. Madigan (R-Ill.) reflected a widespread demand for more  aggressive tactics in dealing with the Democratic majority.  </P> <P> An elated Gingrich said his strategy, in contrast with the current Republican  approach, would be "closer to a UCLA full-court press."  </P> <P> Gingrich's new title is minority whip, the post held by Rep. Dick Cheney of  Wyoming until President Bush named him defense secretary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Not Seeking 'Nice Guys'  </P> <P> Gingrich's backers rejected the view that the minority Republicans must  cooperate with Democrats to influence legislation, as Madigan often did as a  member of the Agriculture Committee. "Ed Madigan is a nice guy," said Rep.  Chuck Douglas (R-N.H.). "And nice guys aren't what we were looking for."  </P> <P> Michel, clearly downcast by the defeat of Madigan, said that he would "go with  the flow" and make changes where necessary in the Republican high command. But  he also noted that a minority party with 80 fewer votes than the Democrats must  carefully select the issues where it can fight and have a chance to win.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders were quietly jubilant at Gingrich's success. They view him  as the Republican most likely to unify the often-splintered factions of their  party if he continues his highly partisan attacks in his new position.  </P> <P> It was Gingrich who filed the charges that have led to a House Ethics Committee  investigation of the financial affairs of the House's leading Democrat, Speaker  Jim Wright of Texas.  </P> <P> "We're obviously going to have a delicate and difficult relationship at best,"  Gingrich said of the Speaker.  </P> <P> Wright extended congratulations and best wishes to Gingrich. Told that Gingrich  had promised to treat him with courtesy, however, Wright laughed before saying:  "I look forward to that."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foley Avoids Prejudging  </P> <P> House Democratic Leader Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said that he would not  prejudge Gingrich, who has accused the Democrats of being run by a "corrupt,  left-wing machine."  </P> <P> But Rep. Tony Coelho (D-Merced), who ranks third in the Democratic leadership  behind Wright and Foley, could hardly conceal his joy at Gingrich's selection,  calling it "manna from heaven." He said Democrats could exploit Gingrich's  ultraconservative positions on Social Security and other issues.  </P> <P> Coelho, who as majority whip will be Gingrich's counterpart on the Democratic  side, pointed out that Gingrich's job will be to count votes and build  coalitions with members of the other party. "He can no longer bomb bridges, he  has to build bridges," Coelho said.  </P> <P> Even Rep. Lynn Martin (R-Ill.), who voted for Madigan out of home-state  loyalty, said that Gingrich won because of his hard work, enthusiasm and  ability to command media attention. "Of course, if you live by the press, you  can die by the press," she noted.  </P> <P> </P> <P> O.C. Delegation Backed Winner  </P> <P> All five Orange County congressmen backed Gingrich.  </P> <P> Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad) said he went into Wednesday's vote uncommitted  but decided that Madigan is too similar to other House Republican leaders, whom  he called "consensus builders."  </P> <P> "We need someone who can go toe to toe with the Democrats and fight them in  their own style," Packard said, explaining why he finally voted for Gingrich.  "They've got their Newt Gingriches. . . . We've not had anyone who would take  them on."  </P> <P> Rep. C. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who as chairman of the House  Republican freshman caucus helped round up votes for Gingrich, said he was "as  excited about today's vote as I was on the night of my own election."  </P> <P> "Without a doubt, House Republicans will now be offering a legislative agenda  of their own which will be forward looking and responsible and in favor of  growth and jobs," Cox said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Are Dismayed  </P> <P> Some Republicans were dismayed by the outcome. Rep. Silvio O. Conte (R-Mass.)  said it is a "tragedy" to divide the minority party over the whip contest.  Other GOP veterans complained that Gingrich was largely untested in legislative  negotiations and the intricacies of counting how Republicans would vote on  closely contested bills or amendments.  </P> <P> "I have a lot to learn about the inside game," acknowledged Gingrich, a former  history professor better known as a debater and gadfly than a craftsman  familiar with the nitty-gritty details.  </P> <P> Gingrich, seeking to reach out to moderates in his party, arranged for veteran  Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota to nominate him for the whip's job, with  seconding speeches by Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt of Arkansas, a friend of  President Bush's, and the widely respected Rep. Olympia J. Snowe of Maine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'He'll Mature'  </P> <P> Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), a staunch conservative, predicted that Gingrich  would do well in the whip's job. "He's smart enough to know we have to achieve,  not just fight. You can say what you want about Newt, but he's smart. He'll  mature to the job," Hyde said.  </P> <P> After his election, which was greeted with whoops and hollers in the staid  Republican Capitol Hill Club two blocks from the Capitol, Gingrich promised to  be a team player. He said his victory was not a rejection of the way the more  easy-going Michel has led.  </P> <P> "If the question had been a test of Bob Michel's leadership, I wouldn't have  got 40 votes," he said.  </P> <P> Madigan holds that Republicans will benefit not from confrontation, but from  reapportionment of congressional districts after the 1990 census, picking  better candidates and sound campaign financing.  </P> <P> Staff writer Claudia Luther in Orange County contributed to this story.  </P></p>

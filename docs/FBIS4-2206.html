			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 6 (CNA) -- Visiting Malaysian  Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Datuk Sri Rafidah Aziz  said here Wednesday [6 April] that Malaysia supports Taiwan's  bid to join the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).    Rifadah, however, said that Malaysia doesn't have a set  policy on whether Taiwan or Mainland China should join the world  organization first. Beijing has reiterated that it should be  admitted into GATT ahead of Taipei.    Rifadah's visit here is part of her global efforts to woo  investments in the Southeast Asian nation. She presided over a  symposium on Malaysia's investment climate in the morning.    She also said that it's "logical" for Taiwan to become a  founding member of the East Asia Economic Caucus (EAEC), a  regional economic cooperation grouping proposed by Malaysian  Prime Minister Datuk Sri Mahathir Mohamed.    She said that to be an EAEC member, a candidate must be  Asian  country that is a member of the Asian-Pacific Economic  Cooperation Forum and Taiwan meets all these conditions.    In meeting Premier Lien Chan, Rafidah said that she is  optimistic about the development of cooperative ties between  Taiwan and Malaysia,    Lien in return expressed the hope that more ranking  Malaysian  officials would visit Taiwan to enhance mutual understanding and  exchanges. He also asked Rafidah to forward his invitation for  Prime Minister Mahathir to visit Taiwan.</p>

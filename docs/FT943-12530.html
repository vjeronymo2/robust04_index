			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Working Life: Federal - Buzzword If the EU is not converging, its terms of abuse are. As the battle raged between 'anti-federalist' and 'arch-federalist' last month, Jacques Santer, Commission President elect, was recast as a 'non-entity' by the UK press, translated by El Pais, the Spanish newspaper, as 'un don nadie' (17 July). Federal means 'government in which two or more states constitute a political unity while remaining more or less independent with regard to their internal affairs' (OED). That, especially the 'more or less' part, leaves scope for debate. The word derives from latin fidere (to trust) and foedus (treaty); the Latin foederatus means 'bound by treaty'. The word evolved into the medieval French federation and then into English. Federalism has become a label applied by nationalistic British Conservatives to anyone who believes in European convergence or the ceding of power to Brussels. 'Spot the federalist' has become one of the main pastimes of British euro-sceptics. Anyone tarred with the federalist brush is deemed untrustworthy by the British right wing though scant attention is paid to what the term means. So last month's search to replace Jacques Delors turned upon whether the candidate was regarded merely as a 'federalist', a 'centralising federalist' (Jean Luc-Dehaene, the initial candidate) or a 'decentralising federalist' (Santer's variety, according to John Major). Why is federalist, for a British Conservative, a term of abuse, but often a term of approval for many Continental Europeans or Americans? Federalism stems from the US and France in the 18th century. It has European roots but an American upbringing. Strictly it dates from the 1780s in America under Washington, Adams and Madison, creators of the US governance. The latter wrote in Federalist Papers: 'The powers delegated by the Constitution to the federal government are few and defined' (26 January, 1788). The architecture of the period (1780-1800) is even known as Federalist.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian head of state,  sent a message of greetings to Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin.  The message says:    Highly esteemed Boris Nikolayevich,    I am sincerely pleased to have the opportunity of conveying  to you and all citizens of Russia the warmest greetings from the  Georgian people and me personally in connection with the  establishment of a new remarkable tradition to celebrate the  statehood of a new Russia. In accordance with your edict, the  day of the declaration of the Russian Federation's sovereignty  has been declared a public holiday. I am confident that for all  states that are Russia's friends this day will become a symbol  of the new Russia's democratic aspirations.    I would like to take the opportunity provided by this  festive  occasion to stress once again the special importance that  Georgia attaches to relations with Russia. This was fully  reflected by the (?comprehensive) treaty signed in Tbilisi.    Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich, we value highly the effort put  forth by Russian diplomacy and you personally aimed at achieving  a speedy settlement of conflicts on the territory of Georgia.  The Russian leadership has more than once reaffirmed its  commitment to the territorial integrity of the Georgian state  and the inviolability of its borders. We are convinced that  future talks between our countries will contribute to the  development of dynamic and purposeful relations.    It is natural that relations between our countries exceed  the  limits of bilateral relations. As regards Russia's special role  in history, today it is primarily that of a guarantor of peace  and stability.    I sincerely wish every citizen of Russia well-being,  happiness, and prosperity.    [Signed] Eduard Shevardnadze.</p>

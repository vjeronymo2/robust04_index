			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Exporters worry over screwdriver economy LEADING EXPORTERS have warned ministers that the UK will become 'a screwdriver- assembly economy' if the government's 'lamentable' attitude to supporting exports is not reversed, the Labour party said yesterday. A memorandum sent during the general election campaign and leaked to Labour warns that, without corrective action, the UK's 'only real exports will be British jobs'. Labour said the memo was backed by organisations, including the British Exporters' Association. However, its claim that the document was backed also by the Association of British Chambers of Commerce was denied by the association last night. The strong language highlights the private anxieties of many exporters, particularly since the sale last year of the short-term insurance division of the government's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). It suggests there was an organised lobbying campaign during the election by exporters to persuade Mr John Major to shake up the Department of Trade and Industry and put pressure on the Treasury. The memorandum says the organisations planned 'to convene a press conference in the near future to expose the fallacy of the Treasury position'. Yesterday the British Exporters' Association confirmed that it planned to meet Mr Richard Needham, the new trade minister, on May 26 but refused to comment on the leaked document. The DTI said the volume of UK exports was at a record level but that Mr Needham was always ready to listen to industry's view. Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said that during the election exporters had met Mr (now Lord) John Wakeham, the former energy secretary who helped run Conservative Central Office. The prime minister, he said, had also been involved in discussions. The memorandum says: 'The Treasury view is that any form of export support is a subsidy and therefore ideologically unsound. The Treasury would rather pay unemployment benefit than invest in employment through the promotion of exports.' The exporters go on to say that the ECGD sale, plus the introduction of a Portfolio Management System which introduced stricter disciplines on the cost of export cover, means 'most small companies do not export because of lack of incentive or assistance'. The memorandum concludes: 'On the government's own figures, the balance of payments will continue to grow in both 1992 and 1993. Unless corrective action is taken, the UK will become a screwdriver-assembly economy, and our only real exports will be British jobs.'</p>

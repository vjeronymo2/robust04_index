			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FALLACY OF THE FORTY;  </P> <P> PURPORTED 40-YARD CLOCKINGS OF PLAYERS FAIL TO ACCOUNT FOR REACTION TIMES  </P> <P> Canyon High football Coach Harry Welch refers to them as "Liars Poker."  </P> <P> Kennedy High mentor Bob Francola says they are important barometers in the  evaluation of a player's capabilities.  </P> <P> Whatever your opinion, 40-yard dash times have become among the most vital  statistics in football, be it at the high school, collegiate or professional  level.  </P> <P> The 40 is oftentimes a major determinant in how highly recruited a player is  coming out of high school or how high he goes in the National Football League  draft out of college.  </P> <P> But what exactly do the times mean? For years, track and field purists have  scoffed at the reputed 40-yard times of football players, and with good reason.  </P> <P> After all, according to these times, there are several players in the NFL who  could blow away Canadian Ben Johnson -- steroids and all -- in the 40.  </P> <P> This is the same Ben Johnson who is considered by most track experts to be the  fastest starter in history. The same Ben Johnson who set a world record of 9.83  seconds in the 100 meters in the 1987 World Championships in Rome, and the same  Ben Johnson who lowered that mark to 9.79 in last year's Olympic Games in Seoul  before being stripped of the record and his gold medal after testing positive  for steroids.  </P> <P> Bo Jackson (4.18 seconds) of the Los Angeles Raiders and Deion Sanders (4.25)  of the Atlanta Falcons are just two NFL players who could outrun Johnson based  on their 40 times.  </P> <P> There are even a handful of high school players in the Valley who could give  Big Ben a run for his money if their times are correct. Players such as Jerome  Casey, Tobaise Brookins and Girmar Johnson of Sylmar, all of whom sport 40  times of 4.35, according to Spartan Coach Jeff Engilman.  </P> <P> If you're looking for more phantom speed, try Green Bay Packer offensive tackle  Tony Mandarich, all 6-foot-6, 315 pounds of him, who has reportedly run 4.65.  </P> <P> The aforementioned players' times are even more startling because they came  without the aid of starting blocks and were run on football fields -- a slower  surface than the synthetic tracks on which Johnson runs.  </P> <P> During Johnson's world-record 100 in Rome, he was clocked in 4.67 at 40 meters,  which converts to 4.28 at 40 yards, one-tenth of a second slower than Jackson's  reported time. And Carl Lewis doesn't even belong on the same track as Jackson:  His 40-meter time of 4.78 converts to 4.39 at 40 yards.  </P> <P> Bo may know track but not that well.  </P> <P> So what do 40 times measure?  </P> <P> They measure the ability to run 40 yards after the runner has reacted to a  starting gun or command. And after the timer has reacted to the runner's  reaction. In other words, when a coach times a player in the 40, he or she  waits for the player to react before starting the stopwatch, then stops it when  the player crosses the 40-yard mark.  </P> <P> Those procedures alone can produce a time that is about a half-second faster  than if the player was timed in the manner employed at major track meets.  </P> <P> Studies have shown that it takes humans an average of .24 seconds to react to a  starter's gun, and that average also holds true for the timer holding a  stopwatch.  </P> <P> Based on these figures, an athlete's 40-yard time is actually .48 seconds  faster than what he ran.  </P> <P> Half of the .48 figure is the time it takes the athlete to react to the  starting command, and the other half is the time it takes a timer to start a  stopwatch.  </P> <P> Also, none of the reported times can accurately be measured in hundredths of a  second. Only fully automatic times can be recorded in this manner. These are  times whereby a clock is electronically started by a starter's pistol and  automatically stopped when the runner's torso breaks a beam of light at the end  of a race.  </P> <P> Granted, Jackson and Sanders are not your average humans, but Bo's hand-timed  4.18 is more like a fully automatic 4.58 or 4.63 and Neon Deion's 4.25 is  probably equivalent to a 4.65 or 4.70.  </P> <P> Their times are still fast but no longer phenomenal.  </P> <P> Even with the "standardized" procedures for timing a football 40, coaches still  disagree about the validity of times. Montclair Prep Coach George Giannini  agrees with Welch, saying that "they're real arbitrary."  </P> <P> Welch's opinion is based on the abundance of high school players with reported  4.3 and 4.4 speed.  </P> <P> "I've never timed a kid faster than 4.55 . . . yet I constantly hear that this  kid has run 4.4 and this kid has run 4.35. I guess it's possible, but I've  never had one of those kids," he said.  </P> <P> In an effort to legitimize 40 times at Montclair Prep, Giannini clocks his  players five times and takes the average of those clockings.  </P> <P> Based on this method, Michael Jones, Derek Sparks and Leland Sparks all ran  4.5.  </P> <P> "They're all legitimate 4.5 sprinters," Giannini said. "Those times are valid."  </P> <P> Still, under fully automatic timing, they would be hard-pressed to break 5.0.  </P> <P> Francola admitted that there are some innate discrepancies in 40 times, but  that doesn't eliminate their importance.  </P> <P> "The 40 is as important as any of the parameters we use in measuring a player's  ability," he said. "The players are very conscious about their times and so are  we. Speed is important. Speed is something that you cannot coach."  </P> <P> Francola, who claims that he has two 4.44 sprinters in Ontiwaun Carter and  Vince Solomon, pointed out that blazing speed on a straight line doesn't always  translate into a breakaway threat at running back. "Vince has 4.4 speed, but he  can't cut like Ontiwaun can," he said.  </P> <P> Then there's San Fernando's Michael Wynn, one of the top-ranked high school  quarterbacks in the nation, who has a listed 40 time of 4.6. He has never  actually run that fast.  </P> <P> "The reason they say 4.6 is because I haven't been timed since my sophomore  season and that's when I ran 4.7," Wynn said. "But they say I've gotten faster  since then. The 4.6 is an estimation."  </P> <P> So the next time you're watching a football game and the announcer says a  player built like a gorilla can run like a gazelle, remember it is a sign of  the times.  </P></p>

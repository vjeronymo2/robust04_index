			<p>931216 FT  16 DEC 93 / The Gatt Deal: Ringmasters who dramatically saved show - Settling disputes / Uruguay Round's transformation from circus act to world trade blockbuster Rufus Yerxa, the unflagging US trade negotiator, joked after a sleepless weekend 'negotia-thon' with the European Union: 'I have tried and failed over the past three Decembers to finish this Round. I'm damned if I'm not going to get at least one success on my CV.' At this point last year, when talk was of President George Bush and Mrs Carla Hills, his US trade representative, making a last urgent push to complete the Uruguay Round of world trade talks before Mr Bill Clinton replaced him, Mr Yerxa took his son to the circus. Much has happened over the past 12 months to transform the Uruguay Round from a wearisome butt of jokes to a reality that is likely to provide a significant boost to international trade. The transformation was based on three men: Sir Leon Brittan, appointed on January 1 to succeed the amiable but ineffectual Mr Frans Andriessen as EU trade commissioner; Mr Mickey Kantor, appointed in mid-January as Mr Clinton's US trade representative; and Mr Peter Sutherland, who replaced a battle-weary Mr Arthur Dunkel as director general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in July. Their first joint achievement was to set, and then keep in place, yesterday's deadline for completion of Uruguay Round negotiations. Gatt's reputation for missing deadlines had almost made it a laughing stock over the seven-year life of the Round. The chemistry between Sir Leon and Mr Kantor was important. While both are Lithuanian Jews by origin, the two could hardly seem less alike: Sir Leon, the patrician Englishman; Mr Kantor a lean, wiry street-fighter. But both came to their jobs with reputations as non-nonsense 'deal-makers', and their shared commitment to close the Uruguay Round deal was soon apparent. At a time when the US had lost faith in any commissioner's ability to deliver a deal from a fractious and hydra-headed EU, Sir Leon instilled confidence that he could deliver what he promised. Mr Kantor compensated for his slight knowledge of trade policy and of international affairs with his unassailably close links with Mr Clinton. The trans-Atlantic shuttle of the past 10 months, which has brought the two together at least a dozen times, played a big part in concluding a deal. But perhaps the key development of the year was Mr Dunkel's replacement by Mr Sutherland. One Gatt ambassador recalled: 'Arthur can be credited for 85 per cent of the outcome of the Round. But by the time he had completed the Draft Final Act at the end of 1991, he had exhausted all of his resources: he just couldn't do the last 15 per cent.' Mr Sutherland attacked the last 15 per cent with a vengeance. He was already meeting ministers from leading industrial countries at the OECD summit in July before being formally appointed, intent on ensuring that the Uruguay Round was the main focus of the Tokyo Group of Seven summit. He succeeded in this. The tariff-cutting proposals to emerge from the G7 summit - which included commitments to cut tariffs to zero on a number of important industrial products - broke months of deadlock and gave other countries involved in the Round a clearer sense of possibilities. There followed two months of intensive global diplomacy in which Mr Sutherland met leaders of all the main industrial powers, representatives of the Cairns Group of 14 food-exporting countries, Latin American leaders in Montevideo, Asean leaders in Singapore, leaders across eastern and central Europe and leaders in India and Mexico. At the end of this process he had convinced marginalised developing countries that their patience would be rewarded, and their involvement appreciated. He had also won commitments from leaders that they would not allow the Round to collapse. A crowning moment was his appearance at the IMF/World Bank summit in Washington alongside the heads of these two other Bretton Woods institutions. The elevation of trade policy to the centre of national economic and foreign policy meant that perhaps for the first time in decades, the head of Gatt was seen as being on an equal standing. Behind the political theatre, Mr Sutherland revitalised a depressed and war-weary Gatt staff. He was never reluctant to bark at recalcitrant negotiators, nor to telephone world leaders for help in breaking logjams: 'I didn't take this on to lose the thing,' he commented recently. Negotiators have often been stunned by his bluntness - none more so perhaps than US treasury mandarins who came to Geneva to lecture, but ended listening, and diluting their demands. As a Gatt ambassador commented: 'If we were worried about the occasional fight, we would not have appointed an Irish rugby player as director general.' During the scrummaging of the past week in Geneva, Mr Sutherland's sporting talents have unquestionably been in heavy demand. As a Uruguay Round success was confirmed yesterday, it will be the trading system that emerges the true victor.</p>

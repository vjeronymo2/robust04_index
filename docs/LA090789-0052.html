			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'COMPLETELY DIFFERENT' EVOLUTION IDEA;  </P> <P> SUPER ICE AGE GAVE LIFE ON EARTH GROWING PAINS  </P> <P> Life on Earth had an easy birth, but a difficult childhood.  </P> <P> Scientists have recently painted a startling new picture of the Earth's early  history, which, among other things, suggests that our planet once suffered  through a super ice age from which it almost did not recover.  </P> <P> The new scenario fills an evolutionary gap that has puzzled researchers for  decades. According to one researcher, our previous conception of the early  history of Earth "has been stood on its head."  </P> <P> The discoveries are also helping scientists understand why it took more than 2  billion years for complex plants and animals to appear on the Earth, and why  their appearance in the fossil record is so abrupt. And the new information is  helping scientists appreciate the crucial role of carbon dioxide in regulating  the Earth's climate.  </P> <P> This newly emerging picture is providing more and better information about the  development of the global environment, especially at the crucial point in time  when the atmosphere was changing from anaerobic, which could not support human  life, to aerobic, which could.  </P> <P> Because the conditions at that time were unique, such a scenario is unlikely to  occur on Earth again, but the information learned about that period will help  researchers determine if life could have developed on other planets and in  other solar systems, and how it might have evolved.  </P> <P> What researchers have learned is that, a little more than a billion years ago,  the Earth's oceans were teeming with microscopic life -- blue-green algae,  phytoplankton, cyanobacteria and thousands of other single-celled species, the  product of 2.5 billion years of slow evolution.  </P> <P> These microorganisms were proliferating so rapidly that they used up most of  the carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere, allowing the life-giving warmth  normally trapped by atmospheric carbon dioxide to radiate into space -- the  opposite of the greenhouse effect that climatologists now fear is warming the  planet.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glaciers at Equator  </P> <P> Within 400 million years, the globe had cooled to the point where glaciers  covered the Equator at sea level, and as many as two-thirds of all the species  on the planet had been snuffed out by cold. This "snowball Earth," researchers  say, came perilously close to being forever entombed in ice, and was rescued  only by the release of more carbon dioxide from the Earth's mantle by  volcanoes.  </P> <P> That super ice age was much longer and much colder and had greater impact on  living organisms than normal ice ages. Normal ice ages, which are caused by  natural variations in the Earth's orbit, persist about 100,000 years, with  10,000- to 20,000-year intervals of warmth between them. The super ice age was  superimposed on top of this normal pattern of ice ages and lasted for tens of  millions of years.  </P> <P> "It looks like the world's ecological system collapsed slowly," paleobiologist  J. William Schopf of UCLA said. "That sort of thing has never been observed  anytime before or since. It's completely different from the sort of extinctions  one thinks about in the rest of the geological record."  </P> <P> But the Earth made a miraculous recovery and, as the planet slowly warmed, new  forms of life began to appear -- multicelled organisms with hard shells or  internal bone structures unlike anything that preceded them in the fossil  record.  </P> <P> In a sense, geologist Joseph Kirschvink of Caltech said, the slow creep of  glaciers to the Equator had the effect of "scraping off the planet down to the  bone, so that life suddenly had a new environment to inhabit." And once those  new environmental niches were established, life proliferated and evolved  rapidly, progressing from simple multicelled organisms all the way to humans in  only 600 million years, less than 15% of the Earth's history.  </P> <P> The result of this remarkable picture of the Earth's adolescence, geochemist  John M. Hayes of Indiana University said, is that "our approach to the Earth's  history has been stood on its head." Where researchers once thought that levels  of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the atmosphere had changed only slowly and by  only small amounts, he said, the new evidence has suggested much greater  changes, accompanied by large changes in the nature of life.  </P> <P> "It's exciting times," Hayes said of the current research. "There are really  fundamental ideas being changed and concepts being developed that are of the  first magnitude in terms of their significance."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10-Country Research Project  </P> <P> The new discoveries came from an unusual collaboration of more than 50  researchers from 10 countries. They have been drawn together for the past five  years in an unprecedented research project under the aegis of Schopf, head of  UCLA's Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life.  </P> <P> The group, called the Precambrian Paleobiologic Research Group -- Proterozoic,  or PPRG -- P, has carried out an extensive series of biological and geological  field trips and collected more than 1,800 rock specimens for laboratory  analysis -- an unprecedented number of specimens for this period of history.  </P> <P> The Precambrian Era, the period from the Earth's formation about 4.5 billion  years ago until roughly 570 million years ago, has long been a source of  puzzlement because the fossil record -- the mineralized remains of plants and  animals -- appeared to begin abruptly roughly 570 million years ago. The oldest  fossils that had been discovered, until about 40 years ago, were of trilobites,  hard-shelled, segmented forerunners of modern insects, spiders and crabs.  </P> <P> In the 1950s, however, the late Stanley Tyler of the University of Wisconsin  and Elso S. Barghoorn of Harvard University showed that unusual microscopic  structures found in quartzite rock from the northern shores of Lake Superior  were actually fossils of algae dating from 2.1 billion years ago.  </P> <P> More recently, Schopf and others have found still older fossils, the most  ancient being 3.5-billion-year-old fossils of slimy green bacteria that  colonized muddy ponds in western Australia.  </P> <P> Despite their great age, the fossils Schopf discovered were not as simple as  might have been expected. In fact, they formed filaments and colonies that did  not seem much different from those formed by similar algae and bacteria today.  Schopf and others concluded that life must have begun fairly soon after the  Earth was formed, perhaps within the first half-billion years, for evolution to  have progressed that far.  </P> <P> But in solving one mystery, Schopf had created another. If life could begin and  evolve into sophisticated bacteria so easily in the first few hundred million  years of the planet's history, why were another 2 billion years required before  the first multicelled organisms appeared?  </P> <P> "We're talking about a vast amount of time," said micropaleontologist Carl V.  Mendolson of Beloit College in Beloit, Wis. "We're trying to read this book of  life based on very few pages."  </P> <P> Based on the work of the PPRG-P, though, researchers are beginning to pull  together the first comprehensive picture of what the Earth must have been like  during the Proterozoic Period, that portion of the Precambrian Era ranging from  2.5 billion years ago up to 570 million years ago. And that picture "strains  some of the evolutionary scenarios that have been widely accepted,"  geophysicist J. John Sepkoski Jr. of the University of Chicago said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Accelerated Pace  </P> <P> Paleontologists have long believed that the Proterozoic was characterized by  continuous and slow evolution, a process that led naturally to the evolution of  the complex, multicellular species. But the new evidence indicates, Sepkoski  said, "that is not at all correct. Early on in the Earth's history, a  reasonably stable (biological) community was put together and it really didn't  change through the Proterozoic."  </P> <P> Only when the climate underwent a near-catastrophic upheaval at the end of the  Proterozoic did the evolutionary pace begin to accelerate again. "There wasn't  an evolutionary march toward greater and greater complexity, toward modernity,  but a record of jumps and starts," Sepkoski said.  </P> <P> The key evidence supporting this new scenario of the Earth's evolution lay in  the residual magnetism of 1-billion-year-old rocks studied by George E.  Williams of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization  and Brian J. J. Embleton of Macquarie University, both in North Ryde,  Australia.  </P> <P> That magnetism indicates that Australia was on the Equator a billion years ago.  Evidence from sediments formed at that time also indicates the continent was  covered by glaciers. If Australia, on the Equator, was covered by glaciers,  then the whole world must have been, because the ice would have spread from the  poles.  </P> <P> Why did the glaciers form? Scientists blame the loss of carbon dioxide from the  Earth's atmosphere.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Carbon Not Released  </P> <P> About 1 billion years ago, the Earth's oceans were filled with microscopic life  that extracted carbon dioxide from the air and converted it into sugar  molecules that became part of their cellular structures.  </P> <P> As they died naturally, the microorganisms drifted to the bottom of seas and  were buried in sediments, so that the carbon they contained could not be  released back into the atmosphere.  </P> <P> Today this process is comparatively rare because the bulk of the microorganisms  are eaten by animals and their carbon recycled through the food chain. Most  researchers agree that the circumstances that caused global glaciation were  unique and that the event could not happen again.  </P> <P> "Organic carbon was being buried at rates as high as anything we've seen in the  last billion years," said Andrew Knoll of Harvard, whose study of sediments has  been crucial in documenting the changes in carbon dioxide levels.  </P> <P> As new generations of microorganisms removed more and more carbon dioxide from  the atmosphere, temperatures slowly grew colder and glaciers crept toward the  Equator from both poles, eventually enveloping the whole planet.  </P> <P> As the climate cooled, whole species began dying off, Schopf said. According to  the fossil record, he added, "at least half, maybe two-thirds of the things  that were alive didn't make it after about 600 million years ago."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Most Life Died  </P> <P> The only thing that saved the Earth from completely freezing over, apparently,  was the fact that most life had died off. Living organisms were therefore no  longer removing much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and the carbon dioxide  released by volcanoes began accumulating, gradually warming the planet.  </P> <P> In a remarkable coincidence, researchers said, at just about this time oxygen  began accumulating in the atmosphere. Living organisms thus confronted an  ecology that had been stripped of most of the previous life forms and had an  abundance of oxygen to meet their needs.  </P> <P> Climatologists know that the first fossils of multicellular animals are found  in sediments lying immediately above those deposited during the glacial period  -- and they are found all over the world. "Some external event triggered the  ability of organisms to mineralize and grow larger . . . and one very good  possibility is the oxygenation of the atmosphere," biologist Bruce Runnegar of  UCLA said.  </P> <P> Because of all the tectonic, atmospheric and environmental shifts, said Knoll,  "we have to conclude that the world changed in a fairly fundamental way."  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Super Ice Age  </P> <P> Earth was in danger of becoming totally encased in ice forever  </P> <P> Researchers trying to solve they mystrey of why complex creatures suddenly  appeared on the Earthsome 570 million years ago have pieced together a  stratling new picture of an Earth that almost became a massive ball of ice. As  carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere by natural processes, the Earth  grew colder until glaciers covered even the equator. As many as two-thirds of  all species were killed off in the freeze.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earth  </P> <P> 800 million years ago  </P> <P> Earth's land masses were concentrated into two large supercontinents, centered  on the equator. When the amount of carbon dioxide in the air reached its lowest  level, Earth was encased in ice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Earth  </P> <P> 600 million years ago to now  </P> <P> The extinction of so many species, combined with growing concentrations of  oxygen in the air, allowed new forms of organisms to appear and begin to spread  over the planet in a new stage in theevolution of life on Earth.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Life  </P> <P> 3 billion to 800 million years ago  </P> <P> Life in the oceans consisted of large groups of one-celled micoorganisms.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Oceans  </P> <P> z3 billion to 800 million years ago  </P> <P> One-celled organisms proliferated, converting carbon dioxide into cellular  materials. As they died, they sank to the bottom and were buried.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Glaciers  </P> <P> 1 billion to 800 million years ago  </P> <P> As carbon dioxide was removed from the atmosphere, the Earth got colder and  glaciers at the poles began to expand and move toward the Equator. Over time  the glaciers ended up covering almostthe entire planet including the oceans.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Volcanoes  </P> <P> 800 million to 600 million years ago  </P> <P> Earth was saved from a permanent deep freeze when volcanoes erupted and  released carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Thus began a process to replace  the carbon dioxide taken out by one-celledorganisms.  </P></p>

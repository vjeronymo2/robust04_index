			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Emerging Markets: Dollar stays focus of market attention - Currencies The dollar will again be the focus of attention this week after its fall last Friday in the wake of worse than expected August PPI figures. A host of releases this week will provide the market with a clearer view on the state of the US economy, and hence the likely outlook for US interest rates and the dollar. The dollar has been in a down trend ever since February, and few observers expect this to reverse until US interest rates are seen to have reached a plateau. The prospect of rates rising puts a dampener on asset prices, and foreign investors are likely to remain wary of buying US assets so long as the prospect of rising interest rates looms. The market thought US rates were on hold after the Fed lifted the discount rate to 4 per cent, on August 16. But the PPI figures suggest they may have to rise sooner than previously thought. The CPI tomorrow, and the retail sales figures on Wednesday, will be the key releases. Progress in US-Japan trade talks will also affect the dollar, as the September 30 deadline for the implementation of trade sanctions draws closer. Upward pressure on the yen could be eased if, on Friday, the Japanese cabinet authorises tax reforms which should stimulate consump-tion, possibly curbing Japan's large current account surplus. Markets will also keeping an eye on developments in Germany. On the political front, the focus will be the run-up to the October elections. A victory for Chancellor Kohl is firmly discounted, and this is adding lustre to the D-Mark. On the economic front, the focus is the Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday. Council members have stressed that rates could fall further, but analysts are not expecting changes this week. Bubbling on the back burner will be the debate on a multi-tiered Europe, which re-surfaced last week. It has the potential to bolster the currencies of core European countries, at the expense of those with fiscal problems.</p>

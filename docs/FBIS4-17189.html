			<p>BFN     [Text] The talks on a gradual settlement of the Black Sea  Fleet issue between the Russian and Ukrainian military  delegations practically came to a halt after the first round in  Sevastopol today. This was reported to INTERFAX by a  participant in the talks who did not want to disclose his name.    He stressed that the position of the Ukrainian delegation  which had stated its intention of setting up the Ukrainian Navy  headquarters in Sevastopol had become a "stumbling block" at the  talks. The Ukrainian delegation put forward a compromise  proposal that both the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian Black Sea  Fleet headquarters be in Sevastopol. The Black Sea Fleet  headquarters would be in the Sevastopol Bay and the Ukrainian  ones in the Karantinny Bay.    Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told INTERFAX after  the first round of talks that the parties had made known their  positions on the separate location of the two headquarters and  on their proposals on division of the fleet ships.    Grachev pointed out that the proposal that the Ukrainian  Navy  and the Russian Black Sea Fleet be based in Sevastopol had not  as yet been discussed.    Experts participating in the negotiations emphasized that  the  proposals of the Ukrainian party contradicted the agreement on  the gradual settlement of the Black Sea Fleet issues signed by  the Russian and the Ukrainian presidents in Moscow on 15 April.  The document states that the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian  Black Sea Fleet will be based separately.    An INTERFAX correspondent learned that the Russian-Ukrainian  talks were continuing at the level of experts in the afternoon.    The two full military delegations are expected to renew the  talks on Friday morning. Russian Defense Minister Grachev and  Ukrainian Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy will hold a press  conference on the same day.    INTERFAX learned from sources close to the Black Sea Fleet  command that Ukrainian Defense Minister Radetskyy and Navy  Commander Vladimir Beskorovainy had met before the talks in  Sevastopol and had discussed the issue with Ukrainian President  Leonid Kravchuk. The Ukrainian position had been worked out at  the meeting stating that Ukraine must receive 26 warships and  160 support vessels of the Black Sea Fleet. The total number of  the Black Sea Fleet warships and support vessels exceeds 300.    However, the Ukrainian delegation did not confirm this  information to INTERFAX.</p>

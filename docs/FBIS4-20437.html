			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gu Yue [0657 2588]] </F>   [Text] Under the financial sponsorship of the National  Science Foundation, a research program has been initiated to  study certain key topics in aerodynamics -- vortices, shock  waves, and complex flows. The research work is carried out under  the direction of the renowned aerodynamicist and committee  member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Prof. Zhuan  Fenggan. Members of the research team include 140 scientists and  engineers from the Beijing Aerodynamics Research Group of the  Aerospace Industrial Corp., the Beijing Aeronautical and  Aerospace University, the Graduate School of the Chinese  Technical University, the Beijing University, the Mechanics  Institute and Computer Center of the CAS, the Qinghua  University, and the Chinese Aerodynamics Research and  Development Center. Specifically, the research program covers  the following eight problem areas: the characteristics and  control of vortex flows; the effect of external excitation on  shear layers and vortex motion; the interaction of moving  shock-wave systems in gas flows; the shock-wave diffraction  theory (using high-resolution digital simulation method and  optical measurement technique); the non-equilibrium effect in  high-temperature gas dynamics; digital simulation of  non-equilibrium rarefied gas flows and experimental research of  the transition region; digital simulation of internal complex  flow field; and simulation of viscous separated flow field and  eddy motion. All the planned activities of the research program  have been successfully completed; many of the results have  advanced the state-of-the-art in the particular field and are  recognized by the international research community.    In the study of ``interaction between three-dimensional  shock  waves and boundary layers,'' a comprehensive set of experimental  data has been obtained. In the study of separated flow and eddy  motion, for the first time mathematical conditions of flow  separation and the conditions that must be satisfied by the  lines of flow attachment have been derived. It has been proved  for the first time that the lines of flow separation are the  lines of convergence of the limiting stream lines, and they are  themselves limiting stream lines; but the convergence of the  limiting stream lines does not provide sufficient condition for  the existence of the lines of separation. Also, for the first  time the topological distribution of singularities along the  lines of separation and the evolution of Hopf fork vortices  along the vortex axis have been discovered. In the study of  flows inside a curved pipe, digital simulation results of  internal secondary flows have been obtained. In particular, the  research in digital simulation of rarefied gases has received  international recognition by world-renowned scholars.    In mid-June, the results of this research program were  reviewed and accepted by the National Foundation of Natural  Sciences. Members of acceptance committee believe that many of  the results are creative and original, and are judged to be  state-of-the-art. For example, the flow-field analysis of  separated flows and vortices, the study of high accuracy and  high resolution format of digital computations, the study of  vortex control techniques, the digital simulation of rarefied  gas flows, and the study of shock-wave dynamics are considered  to be outstanding achievements. Flow-field measurement and  display technique is an important research tool in fluid  mechanics; achieving such good results under existing test  conditions is highly commendable.    Vortices, shock waves and complex flows are currently the  most active areas of research in fluid mechanics. They involve  the understanding of fundamental laws in fluid flow and in  physics. Further studies in these areas not only have important  theoretical implications, but also have practical applications  in many engineering fields such as aeronautical, aerospace,  mechanical and chemical engineering.</p>

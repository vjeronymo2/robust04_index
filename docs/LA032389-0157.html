			<p><P> March 23, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> LA QUINTA MOVES INTO SPOTLIGHT;  </P> <P> AZTECS UPSTAGE KENNEDY TO WIN TOURNAMENT TITLE  </P> <P> La Quinta High School stole the spotlight from Kennedy Wednesday, defeating its  Garden Grove League rival, 7-1, for the championship of the Anaheim Lions  tournament at Glover Field.  </P> <P> Kennedy -- the preseason favorite to win the Garden Grove League title -- had  not allowed a run in 25 consecutive innings. And Robert Espinoza, fresh off a  no-hitter over Riordan of San Francisco in the first round, was on the mound  trying to extend that streak.  </P> <P> But the Aztecs pounded out seven hits for seven runs in the first two innings,  while Corey Giuliano, the tournament's most valuable pitcher, tossed a  four-hitter, striking out six and walking one.  </P> <P> "It's a tough situation to have to play against a team they consider the best  in your league," La Quinta Coach Dave Demerest said.  </P> <P> "They'll use this as an incentive 10 days from now (when the teams meet in  league play).  </P> <P> "I just hope our kids have enough intelligence to realize the score is 0-0  again in 10 days."  </P> <P> La Quinta (10-2-1) took care of that in a hurry Wednesday, as Jason Parsons  lined a triple to the right-field alley, driving in two runs with one out in  the first inning.  </P> <P> Before the inning was over, the Aztecs had scored five runs (three earned) on  four hits, chasing Espinoza (1-2).  </P> <P> Parsons, the tournament MVP, was two for four with two runs scored and two  RBIs. Left fielder James Johnson was one for two with two RBIs and two walks.  </P> <P> Kennedy's Scott Walker entered the game in the second inning, allowing two runs  (one earned) before settling down with 3 1/3 hitless innings. Mike Stenner  pitched a perfect final two-thirds of an inning for the Fighting Irish.  </P> <P> Kennedy (8-3) managed just a run in the second off Giuliano (5-1), who also  pitched a four-hitter in the first round against University.  </P> <P> "I wanted this one," said Giuliano, a senior left-hander.  </P> <P> "I felt I could complete it. I like to throw a lot of innings, the adrenaline  was flowing and I felt really good.  </P> <P> "Pitching is supposed to be our weak spot, but we have been really great."  </P> <P> In other Anaheim Lions tournament games:  </P> <P> Cerritos 8, Canyon 0 -- Tony Coto pitched a three-hitter, striking out six, for  Cerritos in the consolation final at Glover Stadium. Ricky Craddle had a solo  home run for Cerritos. Canyon is 5-6 on the season.  </P> <P> Westminster 7, Dana Hills 4 -- Brett Grebe was three for four with two RBIs to  help Westminster rally for the victory in the third-place game at Glover  Stadium. Chris Larson was two for four with a double, a steal and two RBIs for  Westminster (8-2-1). Lance Marks hit a two-run homer in the first inning to  give Dana Hills a 2-0 lead. Mike Oetinger was two for three with a double for  Dana Hills.  </P> <P> Troy 15, Garden Grove 3 -- The Warriors scored 11 runs in the second to erase a  2-0 lead in a consolation-round game at Glover Stadium. Craig Cochell hit a  bases-loaded double to drive in two runs in the second and Tom Furukawa  followed with a double to drive in two more. Tom Wilson (3-0) pitched a  three-hitter, striking out 12, for the Warriors (6-2). Wilson allowed three  unearned runs. LARRY NISTA  </P></p>

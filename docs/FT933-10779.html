			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / International Company News: BAT shows interest in Seita BAT Industries, the Anglo-American tobacco and insurance group, would consider taking a majority stake in the tobacco operations of Seita, the French state-owned tobacco monopoly, following its privatisation. 'If the tobacco business was to become free standing and we could acquire a majority stake - which it is not at all clear we could - then we might be interested,' BAT said. BAT would not be interested in acquiring the non-tobacco interests of Seita and would be interested only in acquiring a controlling stake. Also, it is not clear what form the privatisation of Seita will take. If it took the form of a public flotation, BAT would be unlikely to be able to acquire a sufficient stake at a reasonable price, the company said. BAT was responding to suggestions in a press interview with its chairman, Sir Patrick Sheehy, that the company would be interested in returning to the UK tobacco market. 'France is one of the largest tobacco markets in Europe. It is of rather greater interest to us than Britain,' he said. BAT has tried unsuccessfully to penetrate the French market, which is dominated by Seita. Seita is estimated to control 80 per cent of all French tobacco distribution, and it has been difficult for foreign companies to gain a toehold in that market. BAT has only a small operation, BAT France, which has a negligible market share. Recently, BAT agreed to swap some of its brands with rival American Brands, and in the process acquired that company's Lucky Strike and Pall Mall businesses there.</p>

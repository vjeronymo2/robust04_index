			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Observer: Lucrative deal GJW Government Relations is one of the best lobbying firms around. It is also one of the canniest when it comes to making money. Having sold out for Pounds 6.5m to a company headed by Frank Lowe and Sir Tim Bell just before the 1987 stock market crash, the three key figures, Andrew Gifford, Wilf Weeks and Jenny Jeger, have bought back their business  -now owned by Interpublic - for next to nothing. Andrew Gifford is terribly discreet about the terms of the buy-back from Interpublic, a US advertising agency, save to admit that most of the consideration is deferred. If GJW does well, so will Interpublic. But given that GJW is three times bigger, and profitable, than it was when Gifford and his pals last sold it, they seem to have got a bargain. It also means that they can compete head on with Sir Tim Bell's outfit without having to bother about the conflicts of interest which forced them to sit on the sidelines during Hanson's stalking of ICI, because Sir Tim was working for the opposition.</p>

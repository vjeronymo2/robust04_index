			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Immediately after meeting the Japanese minister  early this morning, Viktor Chernomyrdin left for Sochi where  Boris Yeltsin is on vacation. The unexpected movements of such  high-ranking personalities give rise to the usual flurry of  speculation and conjecture of all kinds, especially as there  have been rumors recently that the president's health has  deteriorated seriously. Rather than indulge in unproductive  speculation, we telephoned the head of the president's press  service, Anatoliy Krasikov. Here is what he said:    [Begin Krasikov recording] It had long been planned that  they  would see each other at some stage. After all, the government  has prepared the draft budget for them to look at. This draft  has been forwarded to the president, on the one hand, and to the  Duma on the other. The Duma is starting to debate the draft.  In other words, these issues have to be discussed. There are  also a number of other practical questions. Right from the  outset we said that the president was going there not just for a  vacation but also to do some work. He is sending us documents.  He is relaxing too. The other day he took a trip outside  Sochi. So, he has done a little travelling in the North  Caucasus. But he cannot cut himself off completely from  political life in the country. So, he has to hold consultations  with people here on the issues that the government is examining.  This led to rumors that the president had returned to Moscow.  He hasn't been in Moscow at all. Instead, he will meet  Chernomyrdin there, on the spot, and discuss these things with  him.    So, it's nothing to do with his health, or -- there have  also  been other rumors about some kind of coup and God knows what  else. This is all a strategy aimed at whipping up tension, which  suits certain people. [end recording]</p>

The  movement also announced the cancellation of the cease-fire  between its combat groups and the forces of occupation, and  herds of settlers and the resumption of operations against them.    The movement called on the strike forces to escalate the  intifadah against the settlers and the army forces at all times  and to consider any settler who passes in Hebron streets as a  target for our strike forces.    The movement also called on national institutions and  figures  to halt all forms of contact with the departments of the  military governor in Hebron, and held the Rabin government  responsible for preparing and implementing the horrendous crime  perpetrated by the settlers under the protection of the  occupation forces.</p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / US and Russia agree N-cuts: Drastic reductions in nuclear arsenals - Deal may be signed this weekend US AND RUSSIAN foreign ministers yesterday agreed to a strategic arms limitation deal that would cut the number of nuclear weapons by almost three quarters within a decade. Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, his Russian counterpart, said after a meeting in Geneva that they would take their draft of the treaty known as Start 2 to presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin for final approval. The cuts that should follow would leave the world with its smallest nuclear arsenal since the early 1960s. Mr Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, last night said Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin would issue a joint statement today and were likely to sign the treaty on January 2 or 3. Earlier, he said the summit was likely to be held in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. Mr Bush is already due to travel to Somalia to spend New Year's Eve with US troops. He will then fly on to Saudi Arabia and is expected to meet King Fahd on Friday. Mr Eagleburger, however, left open the possibility of further negotiations to fine-tune the agreement. 'It's up to the presidents to look at the documents and see if we've made sufficient progress to sign an agreement,' he said. 'If there are changes they would want to suggest, obviously, we'd have to come back together again.' The negotiations over the wording of Start 2 were completed in record time, just six months after presidents Bush and Yeltsin agreed a draft at their summit in Washington. Nevertheless, the final agreement was held up by disagreements on the size of Russian missile silos, the convertibility of multiple-warhead missiles to single-warhead use and the flexibility of US bombers to carry nuclear or conventional payloads. The details of how these differences were resolved were not revealed yesterday. In Washington, congressional leaders welcomed the news of Start 2's apparent completion. 'This is a great gift to the nation and to the world,' said Mr Lee Hamilton, who is about to take over as chairman of the House of Representatives foreign affairs committee. An announcement from US officials on when and where a summit meeting between Mr Bush and Mr Yeltsin might take place was expected after Mr Eagleburger returned to Washington late yesterday. In the meantime, White House planning for a trip to Sochi was going ahead. In Russia, Mr Yeltsin may yet face domestic opposition from politicians and the military over the nuclear weapons accord. Other countries which were once part of the Soviet Union that also have nuclear weapons may also delay the implementation of Start 2. Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus should disarm under the Start 1 treaty signed last year between Washington and Moscow, but only Kazakhstan has ratified Start 1. Alison Smith writes: In London, the Foreign Office welcomed the prospect of defining in treaty form the agreement on further reductions in strategic arsenals. The progress in the Start talks, however, brought renewed opposition pressure on the government not to increase the number of nuclear warheads when the Trident submarine is deployed in the mid-1990s. Sir Nicholas Bonsor, the Conservative chairman of the cross-party defence committee of MPs, welcomed the progress made but sounded a note of caution as he pointed out that Ukraine had neither taken part in the talks nor agreed to surrender its nuclear armaments to Russia.

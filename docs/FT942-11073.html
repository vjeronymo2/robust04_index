			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Israeli right-wing backlash spreads An Israeli backlash against the Palestinian self-rule accord intensified yesterday as right-wing politicians denounced the possible return of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees and farmers complained about the costs of the economic agreement. Right-wing members of the Knesset (parliament) criticised the government after Israeli and Palestine Liberation Organisation officials said they would start negotiating the first significant right of return for Palestinians who fled in the 1967 Six Day War. Israel says up to 200,000 could be eligible to return but the PLO says the figure is much higher. The right-wing opposition Likud party said the return of Palestinian refugees would lead to a demographic disaster. The Tsomet party called for new elections. Mr Rehavam Zeevi, leader of the Moledet opposition party, said: 'After the return of the 1967 refugees there will be a return of the 1948 refugees and later the return of Jews to their countries of origin.' The Israeli right wing, marginalised by the self-rule agreement, wants to mobilise a sceptical public to prevent the government from making further concessions to the PLO. On the economic front, protected Israeli farmers who will face competition from cheaper Palestinian producers for the first time since 1948 called for urgent talks with the Finance Ministry. Israeli manufacturers also warned that they would lose Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 960m) in sales over three years as a result of losing market share in the self-rule areas. The association said 9,000 jobs would be lost. The PLO continues to make plans for its delayed deployment of Palestinian police in the Gaza Strip and West Bank enclave of Jericho. In Tunis Mr Yassir Arafat, PLO chairman, was also trying to finalise his list of appointments for the 24-man national authority which will govern Gaza-Jericho. The delay in appointing the national authority is slowing the transfer of power from Israeli to Palestinians hands, but is likely to be extremely controversial in the occupied territories, where a power struggle for positions is already under way.</p>

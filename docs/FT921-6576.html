			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / Letter: Environment and syllables Sir, We are all environmentalists now. So, like P D Martin (Letters, February 18) et al, we naturally take to 'environmentally friendly' goods and causes. Or we would if 'environment-friendly' (with two fewer syllables) didn't seem so much neater - besides being closer to its German (umweltfreundlich) original. Among other things, as environmentalists will be the first to appreciate, this would also save forests by economising on newsprint] Walter Grey, 12 Arden Road, Finchley, London N3 3AN</p>

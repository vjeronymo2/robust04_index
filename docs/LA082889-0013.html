			<p><P> August 28, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONE MAN'S URBAN WOES  </P> <P> Poor Ben Stein, imprisoned by modern urban hostilities. Lawyer, writer, and  economist; rich, successful, and probably envied, yet he can't find a safe and  pleasant haven in this heedless and heartless world. The "new barbarians" are  at his gate, and the "new Dark Ages" have begun.  </P> <P> But wait -- are things really that terrible, all the time, for everyone? Take  his examples. I can manage plastic wrap on medicine bottles without serious  difficulty and with some feeling of security. It's not such a bad idea. My  American sports car has a simple and workable alarm system. It doesn't go off  by mistake, and I still have my radio and tape deck.  </P> <P> My house in a modest middle-class neighborhood isn't sealed -- no burglar  alarm, open windows -- yet nobody has broken in since we moved here 13 years  ago. Maybe we don't own enough for anyone to want it, or maybe it's just too  much trouble to cart things down our front steps. Sometimes someone nearby  plays a loud radio, or a dog barks at midnight, and they're building a house  down the hillside, but mostly it's peaceful. Yes, there's smog, but the dust  here is kinder and gentler then the sticky black East Coast variety.  </P> <P> Go away and hide, Ben. Wall yourself in. You're right -- it's a dangerous  world, and trouble is everywhere, even in L.A. Some people have no homes. Some  people are poor and sick. Some people -- "new barbarians," perhaps -- are  desperate, or drugged, or crazed, or evil, or criminal, or some combination of  those things. Our society isn't doing much to solve any of their problems or  the problems they make for the rest of us. I don't deny it. Sometimes, though  not often enough, I even try to do something about it. But right now I'm going  to sit here on my patio and enjoy the summer afternoon.  </P> <P> MARY ELLEN GALE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

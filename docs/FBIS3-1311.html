			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] President Paul Biya of Cameroon says his absence at  the eighth summit of the Lake Chad Basin Commission going on in  Abuja is not deliberate. In a letter to the head of state,  General Sani Abacha, he said his inability to personally attend  was due to commitments at the national level. The letter was  read by the leader of the Cameroonian delegation to the summit,  Mr. Augustin Kodock, at the state banquet held in honor of the  visiting heads of state in Abuja. State House correspondent Oje  Ogbonaya Oje was there:    [Begin recording] [Oje] Mr. Augustin Kodcok, who is also the  Cameroonian minister of state in charge of planning and regional  development, said it was necessary to make the letter public to  reduce speculation and mutual suspicion on why President Biya  was not attending the summit.    [Kodock] My president and dear brother, you kindly invited  me  to participate in the summit of heads of state of the Lake Chad  Basin Commission scheduled in Abuja on 21 to 23 March 1994.  Commitments at the national level unfortunately made it  difficult for me to honor your kind invitation, and believe me,  Mr. President and dear brother, I do regret this sincerely.    [Oje] President Biya appealed to the head of state to extend  the usual Nigerian hospitality to the Cameroonian delegation to  the summit. He has reaffirmed his country's interests in the  activities of the Lake Chad Basin Commission.    In a three-page address delivered at the dinner, Gen. Abacha  described the Lake Chad Basin Commission as a forum to promote  development in areas of agriculture and water resources among  member countries through regional cooperation:    [Abacha] Our commission is one of the pioneers in this  field.  It is, therefore, imperative that our efforts toward integrated  planning within the Chad Basin were in the advantage of all  concerned. However, as members of an organization grouping  brotherly neighbors, we cannot restrict our views only to the  issues of economic development and the [word indistinct] of the  environment. Our commission will also increase its role as a  forum for the enhancement of peaceful coexistence among the  member states. We all know that no serious economic development  can take place without peace and security.    [Oje] The state banquet, also attended by Presidents Idriss  Deby of Chad, Mahamane Ousmane of Niger, and their entourage as  well as members of the Provisional Ruling Council, ministers,  and members of the diplomatic corps was full of glamor.  Traditional dances from Sokoto, Borno, Kano, Plateau, and Benue  also added color to the occasion. [end recording]</p>

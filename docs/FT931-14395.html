			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Portrait of composer attracts Dollars 2.4m: Saleroom A RATHER battered portrait dating from the late 15th century and cautiously attributed to the 'School of Bruges' sold for Dollars 2.42m (Pounds 1.59m) at Sotheby's in New York at the weekend, way above its top estimate of Dollars 600,000. It was acquired for the Kimbell Art Foundation at Fort Worth, one of the richest art galleries in the US. The high price can be attributed to the celebrity of the sitter, the composer Jacob Obrecht (it is probably the first realistic likeness of a composer), and to the fact that Mr Dirk de Vos, the curator of the Bruges Museum, is convinced that the work is by the celebrated Flemish artist Hans Memling. The picture was the highlight of an Old Masters auction that totalled Dollars 12.4m, but which was nearly 23 per cent unsold. A still life with fruit by Jan Davidsz de Heem also went far above forecast, making Dollars 1.45m. In a sale of Old Master drawings at Sotheby's a sketch by the 18th century French artist Fragonard of the garden of an Italian villa did well, selling for Dollars 343,000. The highlight of a Christie's auction of European works of art in New York was a posthumous marble bust of the French soldier and strategist the Comte de Guibert, commissioned in 1791 by his widow from Jean-Antoine Houdon. It sold below estimate for Dollars 820,000.</p>

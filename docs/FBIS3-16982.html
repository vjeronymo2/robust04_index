A ministry official told ITAR-TASS that an official  statement  of the Foreign Ministry on the matter will follow soon.    The catastrophe killing 34 people occured when a  Tehran-bound  Iranian cargo plane instead of entering the Armenian airspace  suddenly changed course due to unknown reasons and hit the  ground several miles off Stepanakert, the administrative centre  of the disputed Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.</p>

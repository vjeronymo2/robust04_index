			<p>940613 FT  13 JUN 94 / Mexican rebels spurn offer Rebels in Mexico's southern state of Chiapas rejected the government's peace offer, saying their local demands were met only partially and that permanent peace could only be achieved via a nationwide democratic transition, Ted Bardacke reports from Mexico City. They also pledged to maintain the ceasefire that has held since mid-January. The peace offer, which emerged from negotiations in the Chiapas city of San Cristobal de las Casas in March, was rejected by 97.88 per cent of the rebel forces and their supporters in voting held over the past month, according to a rebel communique.</p>

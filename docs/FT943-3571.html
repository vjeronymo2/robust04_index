			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Government Bonds: Gilts rise sharply on news of higher base rates The surprise move by the UK chancellor Mr Kenneth Clarke to raise UK base rates for the first time in almost five years prompted a rise of almost one point at the long end of the UK gilt market yesterday. The market had been falling on news of a higher than expected rise in August factory gate prices but changed tack following the news of the half-point rise in the base rate to 5 3/4 per cent. The change in sentiment caused gilts to outperform other European government bond markets. 'The gilt market loved it, especially given the firm comments on tax,' said Mr Simon Briscoe, UK economist at SG Warburg. 'There had been some uncertainty about policy here and the market finds this very reassuring. I would be surprised if the market didn't move ahead in the next few days.' Mr John Shepperd at Yamaichi said: 'If we continue to get tight monetary and tight fiscal policy, this will leave the gilt market very well placed to outperform other European bond markets.' He added, however, that there was still the possibility of a further interest rate rise at the time of the November budget. Mr Michael Saunders at Salomon Brothers said the UK economy was likely to continue to accelerate, despite the rate rise, and forecast that the chancellor would increase rates by another 50 basis points within the next few months. 'This has strengthened his position in the markets,' he said. The yield spread between gilts and bunds narrowed from around 145 basis points on Friday to about 135 basis points yesterday. On Liffe, the December long gilt future rose to 100 1/32 in late trading, up  27/32 points on the day. The timing of the rise in UK base rates caused some nervousness in continental European bond markets because it came so hard on the heels of Friday's publication of US wholesale prices. The sharp increase in the August data had revived fears that the Federal Reserve would have to raise rates again soon to curb inflation. Most analysts said the UK move was another strong signal that no further interest rate cuts in Europe were likely. 'The UK rate rise confirms that the interest rate cycle has turned in Europe,' said Mr Andrew Bevan, international bond economist at Goldman Sachs. Immediately after the UK rate rise, the market started speculating that Denmark would be the next country to tighten, which prompted the Danish central bank to make an official denial that it was considering such a move. Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, still believed that Germany would cut rates by a half-point before the end of the year. 'There is no reason for the Bundesbank to raise rates until the end of next year,' he said. He added that there was no history of the Bundesbank using rate rises as pre-emptive strikes against inflation. The Bundesbank is due to hold its regular meeting on Thursday but is not expected to announce interest rate changes. It is also likely to stick with a fixed-rate repo. 'The Bundesbank wants to give a clear indication that things are on hold,' said Mr Bevan. On Liffe, the December bund future rose 0.25 points to 88.96 in moderate trading. US Treasury bond prices dipped yesterday as traders braced themselves for today's reading on consumer price inflation. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 3/32 at 97 1/2 , with the yield rising to 7.708 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was off  1/32 at 99 13/16 , to yield 6.334 per cent. In the early hours of trading an uneasy calm prevailed as dealers squared up their positions before the release of the August consumer price index this morning. Despite a generally negative tone, prices on the long end of the yield curve started out a little firmer, in a corrective move that followed Friday's huge sell-off. However, the session was dominated by fears of inflation, which surfaced last Friday on news of a 0.6 per cent jump in August producer prices, compared with expectations of a 0.4 per cent rise, and bonds across the board soon succumbed to the pessimism. The market was concerned that the CPI would replicate the inflationary trend in producer prices. Before the release of the PPI, a 0.4 per cent gain in August consumer prices was forecast. Analysts said it is likely that the intermediate and long-dated segments of the maturity range will tumble again if the figure exceeds that level, though a weaker than expected result could bring temporary relief. Any improvement might prove short-lived, however. The market is facing a barrage of economic reports later in the week, including data on retail sales figures, industrial production and capacity utilisation. Most observers still believe the Federal Reserve will delay its next move to tighter credit conditions until November, despite the bad news on inflation, but there are signs that confidence in that scenario is eroding. This week's data should either confirm the consensus view or undermine it.</p>

			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / International Company News: Dassault and Aerospatiale to link under French government scheme DASSAULT, the French aircraft manufacturer, is to join forces with Aerospatiale, the aerospace concern, in a French government plan to bolster the two groups in the increasingly competitive aerospace industry. The government yesterday announced plans to revive Sogepa, the dormant state-owned company which still owns shares in both Dassault and Aerospatiale, by ceding part of its holding in the two groups. The deal is an initiative by Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister Under the terms of the deal, Sogepa, which already owns 20 per cent of Dassault, will receive another 16 per cent, leaving the government with 10 per cent. The state also plans to transfer part of its 72 per cent stake in Aerospatiale to increase Sogepa's 7 per cent holding. Sogepa will then form a supervisory committee composed of representatives of Dassault and Aerospatiale to identify opportunities for co-operation. The two groups already collaborate in composite materials and the Hermes space programme. Mr Louis Gallois, chairman of Aerospatiale, will be Sogepa's chairman and will join Dassault's administrative board. Mr Serge Dassault, his opposite number at Dassault, will become deputy chairman of Sogepa and a member of Aerospatiale's administrative board.</p>

			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUNNY SKIES, WARMER DAYS HEAD THIS WAY  </P> <P> Now that weekend picnics and holiday get-togethers have been ruined by drizzle  and clouds, it looks like the weather will clear up just in time for another  workweek.  </P> <P> The recent storm that passed through San Diego County should be just a memory  by this morning, according to the National Weather Service.  </P> <P> Sunnier skies and warmer temperatures are on tap for the rest of the week,  forecasters said.  </P> <P> The showers that lingered in the mountains and inland valleys Sunday evening  will be gone today, leaving only a few chilly gusts of wind and high clouds  throughout the county, forecaster Wally Segiel said.  </P> <P> Temperatures in downtown San Diego will be about 69 degrees today, with  nighttime lows in the 50s, Segiel said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Warming Trend  </P> <P> There will be more clearing and warmer temperatures Tuesday and throughout the  rest of the week, he said.  </P> <P> The weekend storm dropped .63 inches of rain on San Diego, bringing the total  rainfall for the season to 5.43 inches -- still 2.58 inches short of the normal  seasonal rainfall, according to weather service statistics.  </P> <P> The heaviest rainfall was in the mountains, with Palomar Mountain reporting  4.20 inches of rain and Julian measuring 3 inches, since the storm began  Saturday morning, Segiel said.  </P> <P> Campo, Escondido and Poway each reported at least an inch of rain, with lesser  amounts falling in coastal areas.  </P> <P> The relatively mild storm provided "a good drenching," but there were no  reported damages, Segiel said.  </P></p>

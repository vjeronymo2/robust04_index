			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: APV declines sharply midway to Pounds 4.9m APV, which supplies processing equipment to the food and drink industries, blamed continuing pressure from competitors on margins for a sharp drop in its profitability. The group, which is restructuring after expanding rapidly by acquisition in the 1980s, said it would accelerate its programme of cutting costs, disposing of non-core businesses and increasing market penetration in key areas. Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 12m to Pounds 4.9m in the six months to June 30 on sales which were down from Pounds 437m to Pounds 417m. Turnover of continuing operations increased by Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 416m, although changes in exchange rates inflated the overall sales figure by more than Pounds 50m. Profit from continuing operations, excluding divestments, was Pounds 9.7m, compared with Pounds 12.5m in 1992. Currency effects added Pounds 1.5m to the profits figure. The group said its order book at the end of June was 4 per cent lower than at the same stage last year, but the value of orders received in July and August was much higher. Mr Clive Strowger, chief executive, has closed five production plants and sold six businesses since he was appointed in June last year. The group's workforce fell by 400 to just under 11,000 in the six months to June. Two years ago it stood at 14,000. Sir Peter Cazalet, chairman, said customers in the UK and US would only invest in capital equipment when they were confident that there was a sustained economic recovery. He added: 'The group's businesses in the Asia Pacific region continue to enjoy favourable economic and market conditions. However, it may be some time before there is an improvement in the economic climate in continental Europe, which is the source of nearly 40 per cent of the the group's orders and sales.' The group said reduced trading profits and significant restructuring costs would depress UK taxable profits this year, resulting in a substantial Advance Corporation Tax write-off, giving an effective tax rate of 51 per cent. Earnings per share fell from 2.8p to 0.7p, but the interim dividend was held at 2p.</p>

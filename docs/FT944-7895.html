			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Berlusconi faces questioning as bribe probe widens: Magistrates step up investigation of Italian leader's business empire Italian magistrates yesterday warned Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, that he faced questioning about bribery allegations as part of the 'clean hands' investigation into political corruption. The move is a sign that the elite team of Milan's anti-corruption magistrates are stepping up their investigation and their on-off feud with the government, which took office in May. However, in a statement broadcast on television last night, Mr Berlusconi hit back at what he described as 'below-the-belt' attempts to destabilise the government, saying that 'only a clear and explicit vote of no confidence' by the lower house of the Italian parliament would induce him to resign. Partners in his fragile coalition rallied to his support yesterday. Mr Berlusconi repeated that he was confident the magistrates had no evidence for charging him personally with allegations that top managers at his Fininvest business empire paid kickbacks to tax police in return for a favourable audit. On news of the magistrates' decision, the lira slipped to a new low of L1,035.5 against the D-Mark yesterday afternoon. Government bonds also weakened and Milan stock market indices fell by more than 2.8 per cent. International investors fear the increased pressure on the prime minister might make it even more difficult for the government to push tough 1995 budget measures through the senate, the upper house of parliament where the coalition does not have a majority. The senate starts debating the proposals today. The magistrates' warning does not imply any guilt on Mr Berlusconi's part, and under special rules he may be interviewed at his official residence in Rome rather than in the draughty Milan palace of justice. However, the prime minister was clearly angered by the timing of the announcement. It came at a moment of maximum international exposure for Mr Berlusconi, who has been hosting the United Nations conference against international crime in Naples, and at a low point in his 10-month-old venture into politics. Forza Italia, the party Mr Berlusconi founded in January, is recovering from a poor performance in regional and local elections on Sunday, and his government is engaged in a bruising battle with trade unions over planned cuts to welfare and pension benefits. 'We are not prepared to allow a disgraceful abuse of criminal justice to massacre the first rule of democracy, which says that he who has the votes to govern shall govern,' the prime minister said on television last night. Mr Berlusconi is likely to be questioned about his alleged involvement in two or three cases of bribery by subsidiaries of Fininvest, the media, property and financial services empire he built from nothing. The prime minister has already admitted publicly that bribes were paid by the group, although he has pointed out that the sums paid - no more than L130m (Dollars 81,000) in each case - were small by comparison with overall turnover. His brother Paolo has taken responsibility for giving the orders and was briefly arrested during the summer in an earlier phase of the same investigation. The prime minister said yesterday that the Fininvest managers already interrogated were victims of extortion, a line similar to that adopted by many Italian entrepreneurs caught up in the inquiry into systematic bribery of tax police. Speculation about the imminent investigation of the prime minister, either by Milan or Palermo magistrates, has swept financial markets recently, fuelled by comments last month by the head of the Milan magistrates that the inquiries were reaching 'high political levels'.

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special envoy Antonio Ortega] </F>   [Text] San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico, 10 Jan (AFP) --  The guerrilla members of the Zapatista National Liberation Army  (EZLN) consider unacceptable the Mexican Government's conditions  for a consultation, according to a communique dated 6 January  and divulged on Monday in San Cristobal de las Casas.    "The `consultation' conditions that the government is trying  to impose on us are unacceptable (....) We will not put down  our weapons until our demands are accepted," it is stated in the  EZLN communique, written in four pages and sent to TIEMPO  newspaper in San Cristobal, Chiapas State.    The guerrilla members demand "recognition of the EZLN as a  belligerent force," a "cease-fire by both parties throughout the  territory involved in the conflict," and the "withdrawal of  federal troops from all the communities, with full respect for  human rights." A communique from the Clandestine Indian  Revolutionary Committee-General Command of the EZLN also demands  an end to the "indiscriminate bombardment of rural towns."    "Our troops pledge to respect those conditions (cease-fire  and others) if the federal government does likewise. Otherwise,  our troops will continue to advance toward the country's  capital," the EZLN emphasizes. The text also states: "Since 1  January this year our Zapatista troops began a series of  political-military actions the goal of which is to let the  people of Mexico and the rest of the world know under what  conditions millions of Mexicans, particularly we the Indians,  live and die." "The actions we started prove our decision to  fight for our most basic rights through the only means left by  the government authorities," the text adds.    The rebels issued an appeal "to the U.S. Government and  peoples. They ask the U.S. people to initiate actions of  solidarity and support for our fellow citizens and ask the U.S.  Government to suspend all economic and military assistance to  the Mexican Federal Government, which is a dictatorial  government that does not respect human rights, and because such  aid will be used to massacre the peoples of Mexico."    The guerrillas state that "our EZLN does not have in its  ranks, its organization, or its leadership, any foreigner, nor  has it ever received any support or advice from revolutionary  movements of other countries or foreign governments." "The  report that there are Guatemalans trained in the neighboring  country in our ranks are stories invented by the federal  government to undermine our cause," the communique states.    The EZLN also rejected any links with the Guatemalan  National  Revolutionary Unity, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation  Front of El Salvador, or the church. "The EZLN commanders and  troops are mostly Chiapas Indians. That is because we, the  Indians, represent the most humiliated and dispossessed sector  of Mexico," the communique says. It adds that the EZLN also  includes Mexicans of other social levels and different states of  our country."    Commander "Marcos" who signed the communique asked the  newspaper TIEMPO to release the document to national and  international media.</p>

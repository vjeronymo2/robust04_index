			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Majdi Hilmi] </F>   [Text] The Sudanese opposition National Democratic Grouping  has affirmed that the Sudanese regime's policy is to divide  Sudan and to foment disturbances among its sects and people.    In a memorandum sent to Arab foreign ministers, the grouping  pointed out that the regime has obstructed the Constitution,  dissolved parties and democratic unions, and launched ethnic war  against the south. This, the grouping added, threatens Sudan's  unity and invites foreign intervention. The grouping accused  the regime of harboring and training terrorists in Sudan. It  said that the regime is providing terrorists with weapons,  funds, and passports. The grouping maintained that it has  information that terrorists come from various Arab countries to  training camps in Sudan.    In its memorandum, the Sudanese grouping urged the Arab  League to intercede and stop the ongoing war in southern Sudan.  The grouping also called for removing the regime and setting up  a democratic authority that would respect the right of  citizenship; separate religion from politics; recognize  religious, cultural, and ethnic diversity; and recognize the  independence of the judiciary and the legal profession. The  grouping voiced its support for the unity of Sudan and its  people.</p>

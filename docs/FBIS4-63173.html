			<p>BFN     [Text] The Russian government has, in a bid to improve  cooperation with western nations in arms sales, passed a  resolution granting manufacturers of arms and military hardware  the right to seek foreign partners independently and sign  contracts with them for the export of their surplus products  after meeting the government order.    Moscow has thereby virtually eliminated the Rosvooruzheniye  concern's monopoly of the arms trade. The concern was set up at  the end of last year and, according to Russian Vice-Premier and  Economics Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, should have become a  "holding of other organizations currently involved in arms  trading." However, leading arms designers and manufacturers  objected to the formation of the concern, seeing in it a threat  to the new arms export mechanism created after the break up of  the USSR.    Under the new government resolution, arms exporters must  prove their suitability to engage in foreign trade and be  registered accordingly. They negotiate and pass tactical and  technical specifications for certain types of arms and military  hardware to partners from countries with which arms trade is not  prohibited. Arms manufacturers also have the right to select  agents from a list of organizations which have permission to  engage in foreign trade in arms.    Russian arms exports have fallen in recent years from  approximately 10 million dollars to approximately 2.2 million  dollars.</p>

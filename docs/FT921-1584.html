			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / Rocket failure cuts China's space edge THE failed launch of the Chinese Long March 3 rocket on Sunday, seen by millions on live television, was more than just embarrassing for Beijing. It could undermine China's efforts to take a slice of the lucrative international commercial satellite launch market as well as raising costs and causing delays for the whole of the satellite industry. China is a new arrival in an industry ripe for increased competition. Business is booming but there are only five players in the world: General Dynamics of the US, Europe's Ariane, Russia's KB Salyut with its Proton rocket, Japan's H2 rocket and China. So operators of satellite services are desperate to maintain or raise the number of launch suppliers. Intelsat, the international satellite communications consortium, has a policy of spreading contracts to increase the number of suppliers. Mr Olaf Lundgren, the secretary-general of Inmarsat, the 64-member consortium which specialises in mobile communications systems says: 'It would be very worrisome for there to be less competition'. China, and Russia, are selling on price. European or US launches cost Dollars 50m-Dollars 75m each while China charges less than Dollars 40m (Pounds 23m) per satellite. The price advantage has meant a promising start. China joined the competition for commercial launch services in 1987 and its first successful launch was for a French company. In April 1990, Long March 3 put a 24-transponder communications satellite, AsiaSat-1, into space for a Hong-Kong based consortium. The programme has had problems, however. In December, a launch failed to put its satellite in to the correct orbit. Sunday's was intended to restore confidence. If Long March 3 turns out to be unreliable, then satellite operators and their customers in telecommunications and broadcasting face the prospect of relying more on high cost western suppliers. They will also have to reschedule launches and learn to live with the delays to new services. This prospect has not yet upset the timetable for Long March 3. One Swedish and two Australian satellites are due to be launched this year and the order book stretches into the late 1990s. China denies subsidising the industry. The Great Wall Industry Corporation, responsible for the commercial launch business, attributes China's low prices to low costs of materials and labour. Price is not everything: since each satellite costs around Dollars 100m, with insurance adding 15-18 per cent, operators need reliability too. New competitors are likely to put in an appearance. Ukraine and Kazakhstan, once part of the Soviet Union, have formed their own space agencies. India and Israel have launch vehicles too. China must move quickly to reassure existing and potential customers it is in the first division of suppliers. Optus, the Australian satellite operator, is confident the next launch attempt will be in weeks.</p>

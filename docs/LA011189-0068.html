			<p><P> January 11, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CREDIT;  </P> <P> BOND PRICES NUDGED HIGHER BY STRENGTHENING DOLLAR  </P> <P> Bond prices rose slightly in modest trading today, helped by continued strength  in the dollar.  </P> <P> The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond rose 3/32 point, or 94 cents per $1,000  in face value, by midday. Its yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell  to 9.04% from 9.05% late Monday.  </P> <P> The outlook of a rising dollar helps bond prices by dampening inflation  prospects and attracting foreign investors to dollar-denominated investments.  </P> <P> In addition, the dollar's strength decreases the chance that the Federal  Reserve will further tighten interest rates, said Robert Chandross, the chief  economist in the North American head office of Lloyds Bank in New York.  </P> <P> The Fed does not want to raise rates too much because that would make dollars  even more attractive, Chandross said. The central bank has been trying to hold  down the dollar through tactics such as sales of dollars in the open market.  </P> <P> The dollar rose Tuesday despite the Fed's limited dollar selling.  </P> <P> Bond trading remained fairly light in the absence of important economic news.  Traders are looking ahead to Friday's government reports on wholesale prices  and retail sales, which will give an indication of the inflation outlook.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, short-term government issues were  1/32 to 3/32 point higher, intermediate maturities were 1/16 point higher and  long-term issues ranged from 1/16 point to 5/32 point higher, according to  Telerate Inc., a financial information service.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, rose 0.72 to 1,128.70.  </P> <P> Corporate bonds were slightly higher. Moody's investment grade corporate bond  index, which measures price movements on 80 industrial bonds with maturities of  five years or longer, rose 0.07 to 294.37.  </P> <P> In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal  bonds was up 7/32 point at 91.5 as of 3 p.m. EST. The average yield to maturity  fell to 7.75% from 7.77% late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 8.55% as the discount fell 8 basis  points to 8.27%. Yields on six-month bills fell to 8.89% as the discount fell 6  basis points to 8.41%. Yields on one-year bills fell to 9.13% as the discount  fell 2 basis points to 8.46%.  </P> <P> A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the  annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The discount is the  percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at  maturity.  </P> <P> The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was  quoted at 9.125%, unchanged from late Monday.  </P></p>

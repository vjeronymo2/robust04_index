			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / Rome faces snub over pay accord CONFINDUSTRIA, the Italian industrialists' confederation, and the unions have reacted coolly to last minute government proposals to break a deadlock over wage and work conditions. The government has staked its prestige on a quick deal which would signal there was no danger of a return to wage inflation. An agreement is also seen as an important pre-condition for providing a stable climate for the 1994 budget. Talks between employers and the unions aim to produce a new framework for industrial relations and wage guidelines after last August's abandonment of the scala mobile system of indexed wages. Since then, there have been desultory efforts to find a new formula with some guarantee against wages being eroded by inflation and more flexibility in Italy's labour laws. One deadline has already passed this week and another has been set for Saturday. In forcing the pace for an agreement, the government of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi has dramatised the consequences of failure warning of harm to all three sides. Confindustria has taken advantage of a weakened union movement and the recession to force through changes. The proposals include the principle of productivity-linked pay, and limits on the continued high level of social security contributions and the invisible labour costs born by employers. The unions are fighting to save their waning influence - still based round three confederations reflecting the Cold War division of the labour movement. The CGIL, the most powerful federation traditionally controlled by the communists, risks a split if the Confindustria ideas are even partially accepted. Confindustria wants to end the practice of dealing with unions at both national and local level. The organisation is proposing a minimum national wage with individual industries and companies free to make their own local productivity deals. They have also suggested companies make 'temporary' pay increases above the minimum which are not calculated for social security contributions. These increases can be removed if necessary the following year and do not raise the overall level of social security contribution. On Wednesday, the government announced that a five-man team headed by Prof Mario Draghi, the director-general of the treasury, had been given a month to finalise procedures for the privatisation of ENEL, the electricity authority, INA, the insurance institute, Stet, the telecoms group, Agip, the oil production arm of ENI and three financial institutions - IMI, Comit and Credit.</p>

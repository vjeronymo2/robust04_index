			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 5 (XINHUA) -- U.S. naval manoeuvres in  the Pacific off Hawaii are a long-scheduled, routine exercise  and not a show of force to the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea (DPRK), U.S National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said in  Britain Sunday [5 June].    Lake, with President Bill Clinton at D-Day celebration in  Portsmouth, England, was quoted by REUTER NEWS AGENCY as saying  the code-named "Rimpac" exercise "is not a show of force for  North Korea's benefit."    The United States have warned of a wave of international  sanctions against DPRK which has dispute with the International  Atomic Energy Agency over nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.  Pyongyang has said the sanctions would be regarded as war.    The U.S naval manoeuvre has aroused fears that tension on  the  Korean Peninsula would escalate. But Lake said the exercise was  not targeted on DPRK.    "There has been a long-scheduled routine exercise involving  the United States and other nations," Lake said, "we are not  making any new deployment or redeployment."</p>

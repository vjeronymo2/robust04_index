			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent Aleksandr Krylovich] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- Russian and Kazakh Foreign  Ministers Andrey Kozyrev and Kanat Saudabayev who held talks in  Moscow on Friday, concentrated on how to speed up the  implementation of agreements reached by the Russian and Kazakh  presidents, including the citizenship issue.    Saudabayev, who was appointed to this post last April,  visits  Moscow in this capacity for the first time.    According to the Russian foreign minister, the  implementation  of agreements reached during Kazakh President Nursultan  Nazarbayev's visit to Russia last March has been unjustifiably  delayed, which provokes "some concern".    ITAR-TASS learnt from reliable sources that the matter in  question is deepening and specification of 20 agreements.    The main of them are the treaty of deepening economic  cooperation, the treaty of military cooperation, the agreement  on terms of using and leasing the Baykonur Cosmodrome as well as  the memorandum on the basic principles questions on citizenship  and legal status of Russian and Kazakh citizens.    The sides will also have to prepare the first official visit  to Kazakhstan by Russian President Boris Yeltsin. According to  information received by ITAR-TASS, its specific period has not  been set and will be discussed "at a diplomatic level".    On Thursday, the Kazakh side handed over several draft  documents on which work will be conducted, taking into account  results of the present ministerial meeting. These documents  include a draft agreement on a legal status of citizens which is  of special concern for the Russian side.    The Russian side received on Friday draft agreements on  simplified procedure of obtaining citizenship, procedure of  military service and cooperation on labour migration. A working  group set up today will be occupied with their final wording.    In the opinion of a high-ranking official of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, the present exchange of opinions "will enable  the two sides to remove dissatisfaction caused by the  insufficiently quick implementation of the understandings  between the presidents".</p>

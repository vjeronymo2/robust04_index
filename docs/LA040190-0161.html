			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BASEBALL MISCELLANY;  </P> <P> NAMES AND NUMBERS  </P> <P> EXTENUATING: Richard Moss, the agent for Nolan Ryan, discussed a possible  contract extension with the Texas Rangers the other day. Ryan, 43, previously  indicated that the 1990 season would probably be his last. He is still  concerned, he said, about his ability to maintain a high performance standard  through the life of an extension, but he added: "I'd be lying if I told you  those $3-million contracts didn't get my attention. I'd be lying if I told you  that (the possible offering of an extension by the Rangers) wouldn't affect my  decision."  </P> <P> TURNOVER: The Baltimore Orioles have continued the process that began last  year. Their 39-man roster averages 26 years 9 months, second-youngest in the  American League to the Toronto Blue Jays' average of 25 years 9 months. Of the  39 players, 28 have fewer than three years' major league service, and only Cal  Ripken Jr. remains from the 1986 team.  </P> <P> TIGHTENING HIS BELT: The Kansas City Royals' George Brett has lost 30 pounds  since Dec. 1. Brett said he became obsessed with a conditioning program after  hitting what he considered an embarrassing .280 last season. "I used to be able  to get two hours' sleep, come to the park with a headache and still get three  hits," he said. "I can't do that anymore. I've tried, but I can't."  </P> <P> BUTLER DID IT: The crackdown on oversized gloves was certain to snare San  Francisco Giants center fielder Brett Butler, who told Bay Area reporters: "The  way it is now, my gamer is illegal and it's one I've used for six years. I  guess I better call Mizuno and have them make me a Little League model."  </P> <P> WOUNDED: The Milwaukee Brewers, besieged by injuries last season, are back at  it. Shortstop Bill Speiers, coming off shoulder surgery, sprained an ankle in  the first exhibition game, and third baseman Paul Molitor received an injection  for shoulder soreness. Second baseman Jim Gantner, who had major knee surgery,  will not be ready for opening day, but first baseman Greg Brock will, despite  recent shoulder surgery. General Manager Harry Dalton calls it his All-Scar  infield and said he was hoping the 27-man roster went through, because "we were  thinking about using those spots to carry three doctors."  </P> <P> ADD BREWERS: There's one plus, at least. Infielder Dale Sveum, who broke a leg  on Sept. 3, 1988, and did not play last season, has made an unexpectedly strong  comeback this spring and may open at second base.  </P> <P> TORTURE: Reflecting on the Angels' four-game exhibition series against San  Diego in Yuma, Ariz., Giant coach Dusty Baker said: "That's brutal. I wouldn't  even send Noreiga to Yuma for four days." ROSS NEWHAN  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MINORITY-STUDENT AID WILL SURVIVE, KEMP PREDICTS  </P> <P> Housing Secretary Jack Kemp predicted Sunday that the Bush Administration will  find a way to preserve minority-only scholarships that are linked to students'  financial needs.  </P> <P> The White House and Justice Department are reviewing a controversial opinion  from the Education Department's top civil rights official that cast doubt on  the legality of race-based scholarships.  </P> <P> Kemp, speaking on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation," said: "Like most Americans, I  don't believe in race-based or religious-based quotas."  </P> <P> But he added: "I do believe in affirmative efforts by colleges to open up  opportunity to minorities and low-income people.  </P> <P> "It would be a mistake for the federal government to shut off federal aid to a  college . . . because it's trying to promote opportunities for minorities based  on need and minority status."  </P> <P> The dispute, which has upset many college administrators and civil rights  groups, was triggered by an opinion circulated by Michael Williams, the  assistant education secretary for civil rights, that federal law bars college  scholarships predicated only on race. He warned colleges could lose their  eligibility for federal aid if they gave such scholarships.  </P> <P> But Kemp said Williams' interpretation of the law did not rule out scholarships  based on race as well as financial need.  </P></p>

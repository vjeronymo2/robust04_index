			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Observer: Banking on failure Who should determine the performance-related pay of TSB directors? The non-executive directors? The shareholders? TSB's customers even? The latest signs are that the UK's sixth largest bank intends to branch out and give its opposition a say as well. The dear old TSB has introduced an executive bonus scheme which will mean that the pay of chief executive Peter Ellwood and his top team will be affected by how the bank's financial performance compares with an average drawn from a select group of competitors, including Abbey National, Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. It may be a laudable attempt to restrain top people's pay at a time when the banking sector is generating increasingly vast profits. But it does add a rather random and extraneous element into the calculations. After all, what good is it to TSB shareholders if everyone else flops in 1994-95?.</p>

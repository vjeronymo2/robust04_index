			<p>BFN     [Text] A special directorate for searching and detaining  criminals will be set up in Russia in the very near future,  Sergey Stepashin, director of the federal counterintelligence  service, has said at a news conference in Vladivostok. He also  said the special services of Japan, North Korea, and China had  recently stepped up their activities in the Maritime Kray.    Replying to a question by an ITAR-TASS correspondent on how,  in the light of the latest decree by the Russian president on  the immediate measures to protect the population against  banditism and other forms of organized crime, local  counterintelligence and interior directorates would interact,  Stepashin said the federal counterintelligence service next week  would sign an agreement with Viktor Yerin, interior minister of  the Russian Federation, which would define the interaction and  division of powers between the two departments. In Sergey  Stepashin's words, it has been decided to put an end to  competition between the departments. From now on  counterintelligence officers, jointly with the interior  ministry, will deal in real earnest with cases of corruption in  the top echelons of state power and a number of organized crime  groups using the channel of international terrorism and drugs  smuggling. The federal counterintelligence service will help  the interior ministry with equipment.    Sergey Stepashin said the president in the very near future  would sign a decree setting up a special directorate in the  federal intelligence service and territorial directorates,  accordingly. Thus, counterintelligence will get the opportunity  to participate directly in searching, detaining, and eliminating  those who encroach upon the law and people's rights and lives.    The director of the federal counterintelligence service also  visited the major port town of Nakhodka.</p>

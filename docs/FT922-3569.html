			<p>920610 FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's restructuring plan COMIBOL, the Bolivian state mining corporation, has finally signed a joint venture with Mineracao Taboca, a subsidiary of the Brazilian company Paranapanema. The 20-year contract, to exploit the vast tin tailing dumps of the Catavi-Siglo Veinte mining complex in the department of Potosi, marks a crucial step in the attempt to restructure state mining operations, but threatens to ignite a fierce industrial conflict that the government may be hard pressed to win. Tin tailings are the remnants of ore after the metal extraction process. In Catavi, 60 years of production before the closure of the mine in 1985 have left a mountain of nearly 60m tonnes of tailings that still contain an average tin grade of 0.3 per cent and from which tin can now be extracted profitably using modern open cast mining techniques. The joint venture will produce 2,900 tonnes of tin a year, about 2 per cent of world output and will increase Comibol's tin production by around 40 per cent to its highest level in a decade. 'This is an important event in the transformation of a backward industry into one that is vigorously competitive,' says Mr Alvaro Rejas, the minister of mines. The government strategy for Comibol is to transform it from a state corporation that directly manages mines to a holding company of joint ventures with private mining groups. Last year it signed an agreement with the world Bank to form six joint ventures by the end of 1991 in return for credits to develop the mining industry. However, the unions have vowed to resist any form of privatisation and have caused serious delays. Until now only one other joint venture, Tasna, has been formed successfully despite constant pressure from the World Bank. All other attempts have either collapsed or are stuck in negotiation. At the beginning of this year a deal over another important tin mine, Colquiri, brought a national miners' strike with the support of other labour sectors. The government was forced to back down and signed an agreement to discuss all future deals with the union. Mr Edgar Ramirez, leader of the miners' union, claims that the government has broken this agreement over Catavi and that he has a viable alternative plan that will allow the mine to stay in state hands. Bolivia can ill-afford a more extended mining stoppage. Because exports in the natural gas and agriculture sectors have already been hit badly this year, any problems in mining would be harshly felt. Yet with elections due next year, the government of President Jaime Paz Zamora is politically constrained in the measures it can take to break a strike. Caught between the rock of a declining reputation within international financial institutions and the hard place of another damaging labour dispute, the next few weeks promise to be uncomfortable.</p>

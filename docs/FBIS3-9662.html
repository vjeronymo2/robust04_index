The negotiations, the first since the conflict erupted two  years ago, broke off on March 22 after failing to reach a  ceasefire agreement. The talks were brokered by Russian envoy  Vitaliy Churkin.    Kai Eide, the UN representative who is co-chairing the talks  with European Union Ambassador Gert Ahrens, said: "I think that  we will now conclude the cease-fire agreement and then we will  look for the implementation of it."    The talks are aimed solely at forging a ceasefire between  the  two sides. The rebel Serbs have proclaimed a separatist  republic, the Serb republic of Krajina (RSK), on roughly a  quarter of Croatian territory.    Eide said the negotiating teams have spent the last week  studying the oustanding problems. "We carried out...  preparation on the ground and on the maps," he said, adding  that there were a "few remaining issues. I think that it is up  to the political determination of the two parties to solve  them." "We certainly expect them to have that determination," he  added.    John Mills, spokesman for the mediators, said after the  start  of Tuesday's talks that: ``the Krajina and the Croatian  delegates, with a military negotiation team, immediately started  working on the maps.    "There is determination (and) impatience to get results.  This is an opportunity that should not be allowed to go by," he  added.</p>

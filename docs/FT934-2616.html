			<p>931213 FT  13 DEC 93 / The Lex Column: Price is Paramount Now that QVC has managed to get on to equal terms with Viacom through the courts, the struggle for Paramount is in the end game. In what is effectively an auction, the battle will turn purely on the level of the bids and the mix of cash and shares offered by each side. Yet spotting who is prepared to pay the most is impossible at present. Both sides are financially strong and have star-struck backers. Mr Barry Diller at QVC and Mr Sumner Redstone at Viacom are heavily committed and will be loath to flinch now. That suggests the bidding will go much higher, despite the giddy price already being asked for Paramount's assets. It is hardly reassuring that the deals are based on the kind of 'vision thing' which can so easily lead companies astray. The vertical integration of programme production with distribution channels is at least questionable. True, it has formed the basis of Hollywood's historical success. But owners of the much-touted information superhighways will need to pump as much programming from as wide a range of sources as possible to make use of their systems. Equally, programmes will need to be sold through several channels to justify production costs. A more complex web may thus ultimately emerge. This phase of the revolution is primarily defensive, since distributors feel that they will be stronger if they own at least some of the programming. Mr Rupert Murdoch's early and economical purchases of Fox, BSkyB and Star thus look astute. But the risks to later entrants could prove serious.</p>

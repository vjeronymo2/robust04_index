			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Wellcome under scrutiny - The Week Ahead Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, reports its full-year results on Wednesday. Few surprises are expected and pre-tax profits of between Pounds 500m and Pounds 505m are forecast (Pounds 402.9m last year). Sales of Zovirax, its herpes, shingles and chicken pox treatment, should have topped Pounds 600m for the year, putting it in the world's top ten selling drugs for the first time. Wellcome's margins will also be under scrutiny. The new management has undertaken to increase margins to 30 per cent by 1996. Analysts believe they should improve 2.4 percentage points to about 27 per cent this year. Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer, announces its third quarter results on Thursday. They will be watched even more carefully than usual because of the proposed split of the company next year into two separate groups. Pre-tax profits are likely to be grim, at around Pounds 100m compared with Pounds 196m last year. Most of analysts' predictions for next year are based on an upturn in the cycle. A gloomy forecast from Sir Denys Henderson, chairman, is likely to lead to further downgrades. Marks and Spencer, which singlehandedly accounts for some 30 per cent of the market capitalisation of the stores sector, is likely to make some encouraging noises about its trading prospects when it reports its interim results on Wednesday. Against a background of ambivalent signals about the state of consumer spending, M and S's views will be seen as being of critical importance in gauging sentiment towards the sector. Stringent cost control measures will have enabled the company to lift pre-tax profits by as much as 16 per cent to Pounds 250m. The company's aggressive 'Outstanding Autumn Value' advertising campaign is also likely to add to its confident mood. However, M and S's food business, which accounts for 40 per cent of sales, will have continued to face severe competitive pressures. Blenheim Group, the exhibitions manager, is expected to announce pre-tax profits of about Pounds 34m for the year to 31 August when it announces second interim results on Tuesday. Analysts will be watching for signs Blenheim's recent rapid growth is slowing, and for the trading outlook in its important French market.</p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SHERIFF WARNS DEPUTIES ABOUT ACTIVIST'S  'STINGS'  </P> <P> Sheriff Sherman Block has warned Los Angeles County deputies to beware of a  former Hawthorne police officer whose videotaped "stings" of officers have  angered law enforcement agencies.  </P> <P> Block, in a memorandum to sheriff patrols, alerted deputies about any "contact  with Don Jackson" after the activist attempted to conduct a sting operation  last Friday against sheriff's deputies in the Lennox area.  </P> <P> Jackson, 31, who says police often use excessive force against minorities,  confirmed Wednesday that he and a passenger armed with a videotape camera drove  through that area in the early morning to see if deputies would stop them  without cause.  </P> <P> Instead, Jackson said he was stopped that night by California Highway Patrol  officers who accused him of weaving across the double-yellow line. Jackson said  he was stopped illegally -- a claim that a CHP spokesman later disputed.  Jackson was given a field sobriety test before being released.  </P> <P> That incident prompted Block's memorandum warning deputies of Jackson's  activities.  </P> <P> Jackson said he intends to continue his efforts to "send a message to law  enforcement that these illegal stops will not be tolerated."  </P> <P> Jackson gained national attention last January when an NBC television news crew  surreptitiously photographed a white Long Beach policeman as he appeared to  slam Jackson's head through a shop window after a traffic stop.  </P></p>

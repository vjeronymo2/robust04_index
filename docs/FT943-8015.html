			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Stanelco Pounds 160,000 in loss but optimistic Pre-tax losses of Pounds 160,000 were incurred by Stanelco, the USM-quoted maker and supplier of high frequency thermal processing equipment, in the year to February 28. Turnover slipped to Pounds 1.15m, against Pounds 1.43m last time when profits were Pounds 39,000. The pre-tax result was after exceptional costs of Pounds 44,000 relating to Stanelco Products' move to larger premises and redundancy costs. Directors said the group had been through a difficult trading period caused by problems with one large contract which had now been resolved. Since the year-end the group had returned to profitability and was benefiting from increased orders. The group continued to look for acquisition targets, they said. The shares rose by  1/4 p to 1p.</p>

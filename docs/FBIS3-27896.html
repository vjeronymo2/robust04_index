These two North Korean solders were repatriated to  North Korea through Panmunjom at 1500 [0600 GMT] on 1 February.  The two North Korean soldiers are Private First Class Kim  Chol-chin and Private Kim Kyong-chol of North Korea's People's  Security Forces. They were being treated at the capital  military hospital. The issue of their repatriation was carried  out from a humanitarian point of view, following their desire to  return to the North.    The National Defense Ministry had discussed this matter with  the North Korean side through the Military Armistice Commission  on 29 January. This is the first instance of repatriation of  North Korean soldiers who are on active duty.</p>

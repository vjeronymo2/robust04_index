			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Food &amp; Drink: Lunch for a Fiver still gives food for thought  -Nicholas Lander finds restaurateurs more responsive to pricing policy THE Manhattan restaurants which inspired the FT's 'Lunch for a Fiver' with their Dollars 19.92 offer last year can easily work out what to do for a follow-up: add a cent for the year. But British restaurateurs have had to work harder to capitalise on the excitement generated by the Weekend FT's promotion in January. Their object is to attract customers who may have thought that lunching out had become just too expensive. They have been encouraged by the feeling, albeit still vague, that business is slowly improving. The end of winter, longer days, a cheaper pound to attract tourists and a slightly more optimistic local business community have encouraged restaurateurs to look for new custom in a variety of ways. Wheeler's Restaurants seem to be doing the most to establish a more exact relationship between price and volume. It knows from being a part of the Forte group just how much the public's eating habits can change. Today, because of the revolution in British licensing laws, customers will go out for Sunday lunch earlier and later than the customary time of 1pm - a habit unthinkable five years ago. But can they be persuaded to do so in the City of London from Monday to Friday? To find out, Wheeler's is offering a one hour executive lunch (two courses at Pounds 7.50, three at Pounds 8.75) from 11.30am-12.45pm to fill the quietest period in any City restaurant. Restaurants are quiet because City meetings are fixed for 12 and then, after the normal lunch at 1pm, for 2.30pm. Wheeler's hopes that price - and gentle persuasion  - may induce some flexibility. The group has had more than 5,000 leaflets printed with menu details which are being distributed in the mornings to commuters as they head out of Temple and Fenchurch Street Underground stations so that they can decide to plan their day around them. Russel Joffe, managing director of the six Cafe Flo restaurants, decided not to change a winning formula. As Lunch for a Fiver was generating so much new custom that it threatened to upset his regular clientele, he plans to continue his Pounds 5 lunch offer for as long as possible. He has also introduced it into his gastronomic promotions so that there was a Pounds 5 menu in his recent Alsace festival. It is still bringing in business and profits. Each restaurant is serving an average of 60 Pounds 5 lunches a week (with his Kensington branch the busiest) and he is persuading his suppliers to offer attractive prices to maintain margins. And he has been encouraged by two other developments. First, the challenge of producing good food at Pounds 5 has maintained his kitchen staffs' enthusiasm, which has in turn been reinforced by his customers' more frequent visits. Those who used to eat out once a week will come twice for a Pounds 5 lunch. Out of London, where business has been more difficult for the past year, Lunch for a Fiver has led to some attractively priced lunch offers and to a growing realisation among restaurateurs that they have to be working constantly, not just for two weeks in January, to bring their name to their customers' attention. Tim and Sue Cumming, who ply their trade at the Vintners' Rooms in bargain-conscious Edinburgh, know that their lunch trade is the key to financial solvency. Consequently, lunch menus are Pounds 7.50 (two courses) and Pounds 10 (for three), prices below which they cannot afford to dip. But, in spite of the quality of the food, price is not a strong enough inducement on its own to draw even more customers from Edinburgh's financial centre. But the anticipated boost from tourists, festival-goers and a continuation of a busy evening trade makes them far more optimistic than a year ago - and keen to participate in the next FT promotion. These sentiments were echoed by Stephen and Judy Markwick in Bristol. Situated in the centre of the business community, their revised lunch menus (Pounds 8.50 for two courses, Pounds 10.50 for three) have generated the volume if not the profits. Markwick admitted that in percentage terms he was spending more on his raw materials but that, because he had been so busy, he had not worked out definitively what this was doing to his bottom line. In Norfolk, David and Mary Adlard faced a more difficult problem in their Norwich restaurant. Their Lunch for a Fiver fortnight was fully booked even before it started but even a memo from a local businessman to his staff to take advantage of their keenly- priced wines failed to boost takings. Their new pricing structure, Lunch for a Tenner (Pounds 13 for three courses) has doubled lunchtime trade. Busier lunches have financially compensated for the uneven dinner trade of February and March and boosted morale in the kitchen. It has also given the Adlards the impetus to look for new business. They have extended their opening hours to attract post-theatre business from the nearby Theatre Royale and the first table of three spent Pounds 250 - a significant amount for a small business. Back in London, Lunch for a Fiver provided the financial stimulus to the changes already under way at one of London's oldest restaurants, Simpsons-in-the-Strand. It has recently been re-decorated and equipped with espresso machines that even took the Savoy's marketing director by surprise. Brian Clivaz, its general manager, now realises just how price sensitive his business is. He has lowered wine prices, introduced Lunch for a Tenner, which 15 per cent of his customers choose, and charges the same for his pre-theatre suppers. Business is now back to the level it was two years ago. Clivaz wants to capitalise on this by turning Simpson's into a 'mecca for the mind' (it was founded in 1828 as a chess club). The restaurant has been the venue for Nigel Short and Gary Kasparov to open the bids for their world chess championship match and, on Sundays, Simpsons will host events that will stimulate their customers' minds and digestive systems. Lunch for a Fiver may not have yielded instant profits. But it has stimulated chefs and restaurateurs and, in its wake, left an increased number of satisfied customers.</p>

			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Hoverspeed gets duty-free licence Hoverspeed, the cross-channel hovercraft operator, yesterday received a licence for its duty-free shop at Dover - 18 years after it first opened, Neil Buckley writes. Bemused magistrates at Dover granted the Pounds 12.50 licence for selling wines, spirits and beer after it emerged that due to an oversight the shop had been operating illegally since it was opened by Hover-speed's predecessor company Seaspeed. The company does not require a licence for duty-free sales on cross-channel hovercraft and SeaCat vessels, but had omitted to apply for one for its on-shore shop. The mistake was discovered last month when police checked their records after an application by Hoverspeed's new competitor Eurotunnel, operator of the Channel tunnel, for a licence to run a duty-free shop at nearby Folkestone. Mrs Vivien Judd, a Dover magistrate, criticised police and asked for a written report on why the company was allowed to continue trading after the mistake was discovered. Mr James Rankin, for Hoverspeed, apologised to magistrates for the lateness of the application 'which should have been made 18 years ago'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Irina Petrovskaya: "Novosti-Minus"] </F>   [Text] The reputation and degree of influence of one  television company or another are determined by the level and  quality of its news service. Everything else is added to the  main dish like an appetizer, a garnish, or a dessert--without  this the dinner will seem incomplete, but without the main dish  there will not be any dinner at all.    As we know, the quality of news services themselves becomes  apparent in the difficult and extreme situations--in the ability  to respond quickly and to provide viewers with full information  on what is taking place at a given place, at a given hour.    During the October events last year, it became clear that  our  news is far from being on a par with generally accepted world  standards. This is not so noticeable in everyday life: well, are  you sometimes amazed why they begin a program with this event  and not that one, why they call something amorphous and  indistinct, and why the anchors who make their appearance in a  picture are either frivolous and flippant or display an air of  messianism and importance? Why do they permit themselves to  engage in lyrical digressions and unconvincing personal  assessments?    The event which took place last week--the release of the  "Octobrists" from Lefortovo Prison and its airing on various  channels--once again graphically revealed all the flaws of the  news services of both the state television companies and the  clear advantage of the nonstate NTV company by comparison.    I cannot help but acknowledge that both "Vesti" and  "Novosti"  tried very hard to meet the requirements of the moment and the  event--they made their own predictions and assessed what had  taken place themselves. However, one thing was required from the  news reporters from the beginning: that they show the  event promptly and reliably, with the details.    The NTV "Segodnya" program at 1900 hours on Saturday evening  began with such coverage. Viewers were able to see the crowd,  photographed from different points, attending a meeting at the  walls of the investigation isolation room, the limousines  arriving for those given amnesty, the departure from the  casemates of the principal persons concerned in chronological  order, and Khasbulatov's arrival at his own house. Two groups of  cameramen stood watch at the prison, which made it possible to  provide for their maneuverability. We also heard the first  remarks from those who had been freed. NTV correspondents  clearly, without emotions and personal assessments, showed and  reported "What happened? Where? When?"    After an hour, "Vesti" rushed on the air. Anchor Tatyana  Khudobina appeared on the screen, showing by her attitude that  she was personally outraged by what had taken place. She uttered  pompous banalities on the subject for several minutes: "We are  at a loss to understand Russia." The code of the American  corporation NBC News contains the following rule: "We permit  those whose experience and sense of responsibility warrants this  to go beyond the reports on immediate events of the day and to  evaluate them not in the sense of exhorting or imposing their  personal opinion, but so that the viewers can receive something  more than an official statement of facts. If the desire to  engage in dogmatic expatiation arises, it should be suppressed."    Alas, all the so-called commentary by T. Khudobina, as well  as the commentary by S. Medvedeva in Ostankino's "Novosti,"  consisted of just such expatiations and exhortations, which were  not "suppressed" by anyone in time. But they were very  inarticulate on the key event of the day. As an example, "Vesti"  showed what was taking place at Lefortovo after 15 minutes, and  at the same time, a correspondent not in the picture was  duplicating the text of what we saw for ourselves on the screen.  It is amusing that "Novosti" on the first channel has added the  word "plus" to its name for the news at 2100 hours on Saturday  evening. Apparently something similar to "Itogi" had been  planned. But it turned out to be "Novosti-Minus"--the program  had everything except a normal account of the news.    The next day, which required skillful comprehension of what  had taken place, one more problem arose: the absence of  professional commentator-analysts on state television (Nikolay  Svanidze came out with his "Podrobnosti" [Details] on Monday).  And once again, only "Itogi" provided a competent analysis of  the event, the underlying reason for it and the details, and it  named and presented its well-informed sources to the audience.    But "Vesti" and "Novosti" only dropped hints with a  thoughtful air about certain informed sources--as a rule, those  whose simple formulation attests to the lack of informants who  are really well-informed and close to the ruling circles. If the  reporters for state television cannot obtain information  firsthand, this means either that the reporters themselves are  lazy and lack prestige or the ruling structures could not care  less about them. So they have to make do with hints, innuendos,  and personal assumptions. So it turns out to be neither news nor  analysis, but some kind of impossible concoction which makes our  Western colleagues horrified. Puzzled, they ask: "What are your  television reporters doing? Is this really possible?" Everything  is possible here. Continuous "Novosti-Minus."    At parliamentary sessions devoted to mass media problems,  Mikhail Poltoranin, the current head of the Committee on the SMI  [Mass Media], once again started speaking about "certain  commercial structures" which are trying with all their might to  take possession of state television to the detriment of the  state and the state system. A week earlier, the custodian of the  dying center of television in St. Petersburg, Bella Kurkova,  prophesied the same terrible danger. "Is it possible to have  independent television, bought by the banks?" she asked, with  her distinctive passion. And she answered herself with the same  passion: "Never in our lives."    Attempts to prove what cannot be proved could be successful  when we knew no other television but state television. But now,  when viewers have a choice and the opportunity to compare,  statements about the mythical threat from commercial television  seem strange, at least. The appearance on the air of NTV news  programs, which have won a high rating right away, convince us  of just the opposite: it is precisely the nonstate news programs  which are demonstrating a national approach, a high degree of  social responsibility, competence, and professionalism. All  arguments such as this are unfounded: "Of course, we can try  this ourselves for such money, and buy the news sources." The  viewer does not care at all who bought it, from whom, or for how  much--just give him the facts, the details. The NTV news  programs are providing them--and firsthand.</p>

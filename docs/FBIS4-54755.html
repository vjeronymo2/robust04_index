			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Slovak Minister of Finance Rudolf Filkus by </F> Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not given: "R. Filkus: A Third  Way Not Considered"]    [Text] In Moravcik's government, there are a number of  officials who are not too well known even to the Slovak public.  That is not true of the Slovak Republic [SR] finance minister,  the well-known Slovak macroeconomist Rudolf Filkus, who granted  an interview to the Bratislava correspondent of HOSPODARSKE  NOVINY.    [Zabojnik] What will be the basic objective of your work as  finance minister?    [Filkus] We have to make an effort to achieve macroeconomic  as well as microeconomic stability. We want to continue with the  steps that have already been taken, and we shall not think any  more about whether we should use some different third way to  reach market conditions. We have already gone through the  liberalization of trade and prices, the internal convertibility  of the currency, privatization, as well as a tight macroeconomic  budget and monetary policy. In view of the conditions that are  thus being created, we shall continue on this road.    [Zabojnik] How, specifically, in monetary policy, for  instance?    [Filkus] The minister of finance should not talk about what  monetary policy should be. That is a matter for the Slovak  National Bank [NBS], and nobody should interfere in it. It is up  to the NBS to choose the steps according to its criteria,  foreign currency reserves, inflation, or the budget deficit.  Naturally, there can be mutual consultations and joint  deliberations about what to do next but only to the extent that,  as the finance minister, I must help find solutions when there  is a budget deficit to prevent the process of inflation from  deepening. What I have in mind is the interlinkage of banking,  monetary, and economic instruments.    [Zabojnik] Which part of the SR economy appears to you to be  the most problematic?    [Filkus] The greatest risks exist now in the economic  microsphere, which does not live off its output but is consuming  capital. This is directly connected with insolvency, but  especially with privatization, not only from the standpoint of  its acceleration but also its depolitization. This important  instrument of the transformation process has become here an  instrument for the concentration of political power.    [Zabojnik] You were not enthusiastic about the structure of  this year's SR budget even at the time you were in the  opposition. How will you specifically apply your views when, as  finance minister, you are contemplating the amendment of the law  on the state budget? I would be particularly interested in how  you intend to handle its expenditure component.    [Filkus] Many before us, when they wanted to achieve a  certain balance in the budget, took the approach of using the  so-called salami method to keep slicing off expenditures. For  the minister and his department, it must also be of special  importance and interest by what channels the revenues should  flow in, not just keep cutting expenditures. I must therefore  also be interested in taxes and custom duties, where there is  enormous unused potential in control.    [Zabojnik] You are therefore indirectly in agreement with  the  statement of your predecessor, who said that you cannot squeeze  blood out of a turnip?    [Filkus] Well, all right, but today we have a number of  disadvantaged branches, such as education, health care, and  culture, and we cannot afford to cut any more from the outlays  scheduled for them.    [Zabojnik] Can this government, considering Slovakia's  objective possibilities, proceed differently in its relations  with the Czech Republic than Meciar did?    [Filkus] First of all, we have to come to an agreement so  that we talk about common interests--in the matter of  certificates, customs union, or clearing blocs. We must meet  each other halfway. For example, in the case of the customs  union, we must start with the idea that it is advantageous for  both, but we must also notice who is at greater disadvantage. As  far as certificates are concerned, we took the step on our part  that allows for keeping in force the agreement on mutual  recognition of Czech and Slovak documents, which will prevent  the creation of the situation on the border that we had before.  We also unequivocally agreed that it is necessary to abolish the  old bloc, which, however, is also up to the parliament.</p>

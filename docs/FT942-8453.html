			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Arts: Mummenschanz - Mime After 25 years of hiding inside roles of flexi-tubing, air-filled packaging and moulded foam, the three members of Swiss Mime-theatre troupe, Mummenschanz, have decided to call it a day, having accepted that the number of facial expressions one can pull while sporting a malleable, doughy head is limited. Parade, the company's swan song at Sadler's Wells, is fashioned as a collection of greatest hits but, four tracks into the show one realises that Mummenschanz is a one-hit wonder and that the 'parade' denotes a tired, conveyor-belt selection of inhabitable or manipulable props through which the two-men, one woman team conjure up the same few sketches over and over again. Boy meets girls is the most familiar theme - and one which Mummenschanz seems incapable of visualising as anything other than coy declarations of physical attraction between a couple of over-excited yet asexual figures, sheathed in black from head to toe. Everything in Parade belongs to this tedious, mass appeal 'naughty but nice' mentality and, as one might expect, it is all kept above the belt. In one such 'headpiece' encounter, a male plug and female socket make contact and, even after they have exited together, lights continue to flash; in another, a pair of huge, empty, gossamer-fine condom faces billow in erect anticipation and crumple in flaccid disappointment by turns as their owners dash back and forth across the stage, unable to unite. Watching these vignettes, one sees the weakness of Mummenschanz's art: it has become a series of visual gags which have run their course. And the theatrical notion which informs them - that is, the transformation of human bodies into amorphous, inanimate objects, only to attempt to breathe life into them again - amounts, on stage, to little more than perverse gimmickry. The performer as breeze block or cylindrical roly-poly is not a new idea: during the Bauhaus period, Oskar Schlemmer created various assemblages of moving objects and puppet figures in his Mechanical and Triadic Ballets. At that time, Schlemmer's pared-down physical theatre constituted a radical departure from Expressionism. Watching Mummenschanz, however, throws one back to a far less fertile era of performance - an era of black light mime theatre, full of wacky tricks and cutesy, applause-milking turns. At Sadler's Wells until May 21 (071-278-8916)</p>

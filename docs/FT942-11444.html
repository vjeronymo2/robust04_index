			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / Survey of International Corporate Finance (4): A stately route to success - Goldman Sachs achieved notoriety in Europe after a record year Last year was uncomfortably successful for Goldman Sachs in Europe. Although it has had substantial operations in London for 25 years, it finally achieved popular notoriety when each partner earned a reputed Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.4m) profit share after a record year. For the European partners, this was a mixed blessing. Although the money - entirely ploughed back into the partners' capital accounts - no doubt came in useful, the windfall reflected more a one-way bet on bond and currency markets than their achievement in developing Goldman's underlying strength in Europe. Yet it was not just bonuses that made European investment banks talk about Goldman last year. Along with other US investment banks, there were increasing signs that Goldman's corporate finance business was providing uncomfortably fierce competition for the domestic houses across Europe. Goldman has developed at a more stately pace in Europe than some other US investment banks. This partly reflects the management style deriving from it remaining a partnership. The need to reach consensus means that it can take longer to commit forces than others, but tends to be more consistent. Mr Artur Walther, co-head of Goldman's Frankfurt office, says this helped Goldman to avoid over-rapid European expansion in the 1980s. 'We did not have the bad experience of the 1980s, and there were people waiting in London to be transferred when things started to change and open up here,' he says. In the 1970s, Goldman's London operation was largely confined to being an arm of the US broking business, selling US stocks to British pension funds. But the firm made its mark in the 1980s through corporate finance, giving advice to companies on how to fend off hostile bids. Mr Rick Sapp, a London-based mergers and acquisitions partner, says that its valuation techniques, and willingness to restructure companies in defences marked it out. 'We were aggressive in defending shareholder value against bad offers, rather than just defending management.' Mr Sapp adds Goldman has moderated that approach in the 1990s to suit less aggressive times. 'We offer alternatives, and the clients can choose for themselves. We do not go around advising companies to rip themselves apart for fun, and you certainly should not do it at this point in the cycle.' The most important change in Goldman's business in the 1990s has been the diversification into continental Europe. After building its corporate finance arm on UK bid defences and privatisation, and helping European companies enter the US, it concentrated on cross-border work. 'We realised quite quickly that the European market was relatively untouched by UK merchant banks, and we could offer an international perspective to companies which had relied on local banks,' says Mr Sapp. Its targets were the largest blue chip European companies operating across borders. Mr Richard Sharp, chief operating officer for European investment banking services, says that it gained by concentrating on cross-border work. 'We did not have the natural flow of business in any one country. For us, European work was everything, and so we went at it with intensity,' he says. In practice, this has meant a lot of work advising European companies on cross-border acquisitions and restructuring. Mr Sylvain Hefes, the head of Goldman's Paris office, says that one of its most important attractions is a network of contacts with blue chip companies. 'Anyone can produce a book, and say that this company in Hong Kong is a potential partner because he did this or that deal. But when it comes to saying it is managed by Mr X and this is how he thinks, and this is how his board is structured, then it is harder for a local bank.' By structuring cross-border deals, Goldman can justify fees which are high compared with some European competitors. 'We believe in repeat business, so the fee has to be justified. It can be both significant, yet modest in proportion to the value of the deal,' says Mr Sharp. This may be a more difficult task as Goldman tries to move more deeply into Europe in domestic as well as cross-border advisory work. Although it has managed to persuade many of the large UK companies to employ it alongside UK merchant banks, it has yet to achieve the same strength elsewhere. Goldman's partners admit that it is still vulnerable to European competitors playing on its US roots. But Mr Hefes says it can flourish despite this. 'We do not have to wrap ourselves in the French flag. We just have to show that we are competent, and we are here to stay,' he says.</p>

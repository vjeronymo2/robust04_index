			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Letter: Driving out photocopier 'cowboys' Sir, Members of the Finance &amp; Leasing Association, who account for about 80 per cent of the UK photocopier leasing market, are concerned about the bad publicity on the industry ('Companies fooled by 'cowboy' copier salesmen', August 18). Much coverage has not mentioned steps taken to correct the situation described. The vast majority of complaints are not against members of the FLA. Detailed FLA guidelines were agreed in January addressing the problems of documentation. These were registered by the Office of Fair Trading. All members' documentation had to be revised by April 1 and this was achieved. These guidelines ensure contracts do not contain unclear clauses which could involve costly extras. They state that the period of hire must not be longer than the expected life of the equipment. We, like the CBI and the Campaign To Clean Up Copier Contracts, are determined to eliminate the industry's problems. Ron Young, chairman, Finance &amp; Leasing Association, 18 Upper Grosvenor Street, London W1X 9PB</p>

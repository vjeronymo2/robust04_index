			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 20 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice-President  Rong Yiren held talks here this morning with Philippine  Vice-President Joseph Ejercito Estrada.    During the talks Estrada reaffirmed his government's  "one-China" policy, and Rong expressed his appreciation for this.    Estrada said that the Philippine economic and cultural ties  with Taiwan are confined to the non-governmental level.    The Philippine Government adheres to its firm promise made  in  a communique signed between the two countries in 1975 and to its  consistent stand that the Government of the People's Republic of  China is the only legitimate government of China, and that  Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.    During the talks, which lasted for over an hour, Rong and  Estrada exchanged views on bilateral issues and regional and  other international issues of common concern.    Rong spoke highly of the development of bilateral friendly  ties over the past few years, adding that China and the  Philippines are close neighbors, and leaders of the two  countries have exchanged visits frequently.    He noted that gratifying results have been made in bilateral  exchanges and cooperation in the fields of politics, economy,  trade, and science and technology as well as culture since the  two countries established diplomatic relations 19 years ago.    He said China places great importance on developing its  trade  and economic cooperation with the Philippines, and encourages  Chinese industrialists and businessmen to conduct varied ways of  cooperation in the Philippines.    Rong said that the cooperation of Philippine industrialists  and businessmen is also welcomed by China.    He said he was convinced that, with joint efforts, Sino-  Philippine relations will grow in depth.    Estrada said he was satisfied with the growth of bilateral  friendly ties and cooperation, and said he hoped that his visit  would contribute to furthering such a relationship.    He said he wished to increase the volume of bilateral trade  and welcomed more Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in his country.    During the talks Estrada invited Rong to visit the  Philippines, and Rong accepted the invitation with pleasure.    Before the talks Rong presided over a ceremony welcoming  Vice- President Estrada and Mrs. Estrada and their party.    After the talks, the two leaders attended a ceremony to sign  a trade protocol for this year.    In the afternoon, the Philippine vice-president met Tao  Siju,  minister of public security.    This evening Rong is to give a banquet in honor of Estrada  and his party.</p>

The two-day conference was held at the United Nations  University in Tokyo.    "Population growth is a major obstacle to the alleviation of  poverty, sustained socioeconomic development, and the  improvement of the status of women," said the draft text of the  Tokyo declaration of the meeting of eminent persons on  population and development.    The meeting, also sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was  held  in preparation for the International Conference on Population  and Development (ICPD) slated for September in Cairo.    "We...call upon all governments and intergovernmental and  nongovernmental organizations to do their utmost to make the  (Cairo) conference a milestone in the global effort to eradicate  poverty and socioeconomic inequality, to achieve sustained  economic growth and sustainable development, to improve the  status and role of women and to reduce population growth," it  said.    The United Nations has predicted the world population, now  at  5.6 billion, will increase to 10 billion by 2050.    The declaration urged developing countries to integrate  population issues into national development planning, and  developed nations to change their patterns of consumption and to  curb overproduction in order to reduce the impact on the  environment and on the use of resources.    It also urged "the world community...to increase their  financial commitment to population and related activities in  developing countries in order to reach the estimated amount of  approximately 13 billion dollars...by the year 2000 and  approximately 17 billion dollars by the year 2015 annually."    At a news conference held immediately after the meeting  ended, International Planned Parenthood Federation President  Fred Sai, vice chairman of the Tokyo meeting, said, "one thing  which has come out here...is that...we have to start addressing  population issues much more seriously."    He said the other point stressed through the discussion was  the importance of "partnership between the developed and  developing countries."    The news conference was also attended by Nafis Sadik,  executive director of the U.N. Population Fund, U.N. University  Rector Heitor Gurgulino de Souza, Egypt's National Population  Council Secretary General Maher Mahran [name as received] and  former Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, chairman of the  gathering.    The 14-member panel of the meeting debated sustainable  development, family planning and the status of women in relation  to population.    The panel also included former World Bank President Robert  McNamara, former Mexican President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado  and former Kiribati President Jeremia T. Tabai.</p>

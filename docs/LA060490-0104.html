			<p><P> June 4, 1990, Monday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> Santa Paula shooting -- An item on Sunday's Week in Review page incorrectly  stated that Delfino Enricos Lopez, 43, of Santa Paula was accused in the  shooting of a neighbor May 28. Lopez had been arrested on suspicion of murder  after the shooting, but he was released Friday after prosecutors said they had  insufficient evidence to prove he had committed a crime.  </P></p>

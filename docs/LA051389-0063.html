			<p><P> May 13, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BIG OIL' IS ALL OF US;  </P> <P> A NATION OF GAS GUZZLERS CAN'T BLAME THE SUPPLIER  </P> <P> It was lively theater -- but not much more -- when a member of Congress stood  in the well of the House the other day and scissored in half his Exxon credit  card. It was heady populism -- but not much more -- when some talk-radio  babblers called for a boycott of Exxon.  </P> <P> Aside from a few satisfying moments of stick-it-to-the-bums glee, these attacks  on Exxon the oil spiller do little to protect the world from the next  blackening, in Alaska or wherever.  </P> <P> What does a boycott accomplish? Don't fill up at the Exxon gas station but  drive down the street to Amoco? That's the company guilty of Europe's worst oil  spill when its Amoco Cadiz came apart off the coast of Brittany in 1978. Or  perhaps instead of Exxon, boycotters should buy from Unocal? It was 20 years  ago this spring that one of Union Oil's offshore rigs broke and blackened the  beaches of Santa Barbara, Calif.  </P> <P> I went to Santa Barbara in May, 1969, to write about the spill. Boycott fervor  was in the air then, too. Union was vilified by a citizens' group, GOO (Get Oil  Out).  </P> <P> Big oil didn't get out -- not out of the Santa Barbara Channel, nor Prince  William Sound, nor Antarctica's Palmer Peninsula where 250,000 gallons of oil  were spilled last January.  </P> <P> To be meaningful, a boycott of all oil companies would be needed. The  congressman-showman who snipped his Exxon credit card would have been credible  had he announced, say, that he was cutting in half his personal consumption of  oil or was taking public transportation or commuting by bicycle to work or  insulating his home, or was pushing for heat-tight buildings back in his home  district where he rents office space.  </P> <P> Energy conservation and energy efficiency is the only boycott that oil  companies respect, because it's the only one that can last beyond the latest  post-spill furor. If a nation's habits of consumption are radically changed,  the oil industry's habits of production are forced to change also.  </P> <P> Greenpeace magazine reports this month that "the United States loses more  energy each year through poorly engineered windows than is provided by all the  oil flowing through the Alaska pipeline."  </P> <P> Environmental groups have deep wells of information to prove that America can  save more oil than it can produce or import. The ability to change cars from  gas guzzlers to gas sippers has been demonstrated. In 1973 automobile  efficiency was an inefficient 14 miles per gallon. Two years later federal  standards were passed and the efficiency doubled to 28 m.p.g. by 1987. The  technology is available to increase it to 45 m.p.g. by 1995, which would  eventually more than eliminate the need to import any oil at all.  </P> <P> Nothing has been said by George Bush since the Alaska spill about rallying the  country to conservation or efficiency. The former Texas oil man doesn't think  that way. When he was vice president, Bush's Task Force on Regulatory Relief  tried to repeal the 1975 fuel-efficiency standards. Congress refused, but did,  as a compromise, weaken them.  </P> <P> Instead of the President promoting conservation and efficiency, his Department  of Interior is advancing proposals for exploiting coastal oil off Washington,  Oregon and Florida, as well as in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Of seven  industrial nations, the United States ranks last in the percentage of income  devoted to energy-conservation research.  </P> <P> If oil were an illegal drug, the United States would be the world's sorriest  addict. It has 5% of the Earth's population but consumes 25% of its energy.  </P> <P> The high from this addiction is so pleasurable that only a few politicians dare  advance the conservation ethic. A member of Congress who called on Americans,  let's say, to bicycle to work would be as ridiculed as Jimmy Carter was when he  asked citizens to lower their thermostats.  </P> <P> When freebasing, whether on crack or oil, addicts lose touch with reality. Now  the Exxon addicts are announcing that they are changing dealers, as if becoming  an Amoco addict is the answer. It's not. A boycott high, apparently, has some  of the same thrill as an oil high. And the same downer after.  </P></p>

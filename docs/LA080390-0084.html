			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ABC SCALES TWIN TV PEAKS IN AWARD NOMINATIONS;  </P> <P> EMMYS: ABC HOPES PUBLICITY WILL BOOST THE SERIAL'S RATINGS AND THE NETWORK'S  EFFORTS TO CATCH NBC.  </P> <P> News that ABC's "Twin Peaks" had topped all shows with 14 Emmy nominations and  that the network had tied NBC in the overall totals with 95 prompted shouts of  glee in the second-place network's Century City offices Thursday.  </P> <P> "There's a bunch of happy folks over here," said Ted Harbert, ABC's executive  vice president for prime time. "Good news doesn't come in big heaps very often  in this business, and so when you do get a big heap of good news, we allow  ourselves, to quote (former ABC Entertainment President) Brandon Stoddard from  a few years back, 11 minutes to revel in the joy before getting right back to  it."  </P> <P> Right back to it for ABC means spreading the news, especially about "Twin  Peaks." The quirky soap opera begins eight weeks of reruns Sunday, and Harbert  said that beginning tonight, the network will be airing promos touting the fact  that the series claimed more Emmy nominations than any other show this year.  </P> <P> Although there is no direct correlation between Emmy honors and ratings -- in  fact, some of this season's highest-rated series, including "The Cosby Show,"  "Roseanne" and "America's Funniest Home Videos," were largely ignored by the  Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences -- history suggests that heavy Emmy  recognition can provide a boost to some shows. "Hill Street Blues," for  example, was dismally rated when it first hit the air, but after snagging 21  nominations and virtually sweeping the major awards in 1981, viewership began  to grow. It eventually became a ratings success.  </P> <P> Harbert believes that even for a show like "Twin Peaks," which already has been  blessed with an inordinate amount of media attention, the Emmy nominations  can't help but lure more viewers into its weird and wild web of intrigue.  </P> <P> "There are still a lot of people out there, millions of Americans, who have  never seen the show," he said. "Maybe they were 'Cheers' fans and they weren't  available to watch it on Thursdays. For a brand new show -- and remember, 'Twin  Peaks' has only been on for seven episodes (plus the two-hour pilot) -- this  kind of recognition is truly helpful. I think you can draw a direct comparison  to 'Hill Street.' There was a show that started slowly in the ratings and the  recognition certainly served as a motivation for people to check it out and see  what all the fuss was about."  </P> <P> "I think it will help in bringing new people to the show, particularly since we  are starting reruns on Sunday," said Mark Frost, executive producer and  co-creator of "Twin Peaks." "Fourteen Emmy nominations may be just enough  incentive for some people who have resisted before, or who haven't been around  at the right time, to make a point of tuning us in."  </P> <P> Overall, ABC was up 10 nominations from last year, while NBC, which has led the  Emmy race and the ratings race for the last several years, was down eight.  Harbert said that the tie in total nominations is one of the signals that ABC,  which narrowed the ratings gap a bit this past season, is closing in on No. 1.  </P> <P> "It's a great tribute to the quality of the staffs our producers have put  together," he said, "and proof that if you put on better shows, people will  notice. . . . It's terrific for morale. Ratings are so hard to get no matter  how good your shows are, this kind of validation is a good motivator to keep on  going."  </P> <P> For David Lynch, the director of such eccentric films as "Blue Velvet," "The  Elephant Man" and "Eraserhead," Thursday was like a dream sequence right out  "Twin Peaks." In his maiden American television effort, Lynch could become the  first person to win five Emmys for one show in a single year.  </P> <P> "It's pretty amazing," Lynch said from the set of the show, where he is  directing an episode for the upcoming season. "Nothing like this has ever  happened to me before."  </P> <P> Lynch was nominated for producing, directing, writing, song lyrics and  composing the series' main title theme music with Angelo Badalamenti. (Sam  Simon, co-executive producer of "The Tracey Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons,"  was also nominated for five Emmys on Thursday, but since two of them are in the  same category, he could only win five if they tied.)  </P> <P> Lynch's film "Wild at Heart," which opens in theaters Aug. 17, already won the  grand prize at the Cannes Film Festival this year. He received a best director  Academy Award nomination for "Blue Velvet," but didn't win.  </P></p>

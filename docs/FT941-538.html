			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Markets get heartburn after poll party: The Italian election  -Berlusconi alliance succeeds in the campaign but must now find a way to govern The Italian election appears to have delivered most of what a nervous financial and business community had hoped for: a clear victory in the lower chamber of parliament by a single alliance of the right. Some horse-trading will be necessary for control of the upper house, but the fear of a parliament in which no single grouping has a majority has gone. However, investors are notoriously fickle when it comes to politics. On Monday, the markets were inspired by secret and illegal exit polls showing Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, as a clear winner at the head of his Forza Italia party and its allies, the populist Northern League and the far-right National Alliance. Milan's main stock market index rose by 3.76 per cent; the lira strengthened. Yesterday, although those predictions were broadly confirmed, the hangover from Monday's election night party took its toll. The Milan index began to lose ground as the markets digested the fact that the Berlusconi alliance, so adept at campaigning, would now have to turn its hand to the trickier task of governing. 'International investors will focus on what any government has to do, and they will judge a government by how quickly it acts,' said Mr Vittorio Pignatti-Morano, general manager of Lehman Brothers in Italy. Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, yesterday echoed these sentiments, urging a new government to act quickly and clearly to pursue the process of economic improvement begun by the technocratic government of the past two years. 'The vote has given a clear indication of a choice which supports market forces and gives the state a fundamental role in direction and control (of the economy) rather than management, freeing the economy from the bonds which restrain it.' The main reason for market concern is the potential for a row between Mr Berlusconi and his partners. Even as results came in on Monday night, Mr Umberto Bossi, head of the Northern League, made a point of knocking the media magnate's aspirations to be prime minister and repeating reservations about governing with the National Alliance. In its first phase, the new government will have to act quickly to reshape the public sector, implement fiscal reform and plug the gaps in the pensions budget. Only then is the new coalition likely to pursue its promises of stimulating economic recovery, including Forza Italia's ambitious promise to create 1m jobs. In the meantime, many entrepreneurs will be looking to the government to break the old incestuous links between business and politics. Critics doubt Mr Berlusconi is the man to champion a new relationship. Coincidentally, the trial began yesterday of Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist party chief, and 12 others accused of corruption over alleged bribes by an insurance company for a contract with state energy group Eni. On privatisation, which the victorious parties want to speed up, the government will have to take a final decision on how to sell 52 per cent of Stet, the national telecoms utility, and who should advise on the sale, but the timetable for this and other outstanding privatisations is already pencilled into investors' diaries. In any case, entrepreneurs who stood successfully for Forza Italia, the Northern League and the National Alliance across the country should try to hold the new government to its promises to favour small and medium-sized enterprises as well as the industrial conglomerates traditionally close to the government. The new administration will not want to alienate this support. As Mr Alberto Rolla of securities house Milla put it yesterday: 'The political struggle was very dirty, especially in the last days (of the campaign), and his (Mr Berlusconi's) problem now is presenting himself as someone who can make peace with everyone.'</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLUMN RIGHT;  </P> <P> DON'T RUSH INTO FOLLY IN THE GULF;  </P> <P> THERE ARE NO COMPELLING ARGUMENTS FOR STARTING A WAR WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL  CONSENT.  </P> <P> The beat of Persian Gulf war drums has suddenly become very loud. Reiterating  that Saddam Hussein is another Hitler, the Administration is now hinting that  the mistreatment of U.S. hostages in Iraq and Kuwait will be used as a pretext  for war.  </P> <P> The United States is again sliding inexorably into a war the Congress has not  sanctioned. Since 1945, American Presidents have committed U.S. troops to two  major wars (Korea and Vietnam) and a host of lesser conflicts (most recently  Panama, Grenada and Lebanon) without asking Congress to declare war. Dusting  off the imperial presidency's supposed prerogatives, the Bush Administration  has categorically refused to promise that it will seek congressional  authorization before initiating hostilities against Iraq. Congress should act  now -- before it is too late -- and prohibit the use of U.S. forces in  offensive actions against Iraq unless Congress expressly approves.  </P> <P> By making the President commander in chief while reserving to Congress the  power to declare war and ratify treaties, the Framers issued -- in  constitutional scholar Edward S. Corwin's oft-quoted observation -- an  invitation for the two branches to struggle for supremacy in conducting foreign  policy. Nevertheless, until the end of World War II, it was clearly understood  that a President could not commit U.S. forces to a major conflict without the  consent of Congress.  </P> <P> The Cold War's exigencies upset the delicate constitutional balance. To meet  the perceived communist threat in a world that was viewed as bipolar both  geopolitically and ideologically, the United States became a national security  state -- permanently mobilized for war in order to contain communism worldwide.  Executive-branch authority increased dramatically while congressional power  eroded (and, to a large degree, was abdicated voluntarily). In a nuclear world,  it was said, the President needed a free hand to respond quickly to global  crises.  </P> <P> In the Persian Gulf crisis, however, there are no compelling arguments for  allowing the Administration to start a war without first obtaining  congressional consent. Americans and their elected representatives have the  time to debate Washington's Persian Gulf policy, a debate too important to be  left to street demonstrations staged by aging 1960s radicals. The Persian Gulf  crisis is not a Cold War superpower confrontation with all the possibilities of  sudden escalation to the nuclear level that such a clash could entail. There is  no imminent danger to America's territorial integrity, to its physical and  economic security or even to the global balance of power. Thus, none of the  conditions cited during the Cold War as support for unconstrained presidential  authority to use the military apply in this case. This crisis has dragged on  more than three months, and there is time to reflect before making the fateful  decision for war in the gulf, a conflict that may not end quickly and will  assuredly cost many American lives.  </P> <P> A sober assessment of U.S. policy objectives in the gulf is needed. Will  vanquishing Iraq really bring stability to that perennially volatile region?  Will the anti-Iraq coalition hold together if the United States strikes Iraq  first? What impact will an American-initiated war have on moderate Arab  governments -- and on Arab populations? How will Washington's policy affect  U.S.-Israeli relations?  </P> <P> Beyond the issues pertinent to the immediate crisis, Bush's whole notion of a  "new world order" needs to be scrutinized. In the post-Cold War era, it is far  from clear that America must remain the world's policeman, or that it can  afford to do so. In this sense, the Persian Gulf crisis provides the  opportunity for a new, full-scale "Great Debate" about America's purposes and  world role.  </P> <P> Wars are easy to start but often difficult to end. Thus the hard questions --  the nature of America's security interests, the feasibility of Washington's  objectives and the relationship of military means to policy ends must be asked  before the shooting starts.  </P> <P> In its historic 1966 hearings, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee asked the  right questions about U.S. policy in Vietnam. But it was too late to halt the  march of folly in Southeast Asia, because vast numbers of American troops had  already been committed to combat. Congress should not make that mistake again.  Morally and constitutionally, it is time for Congress to assert its  foreign-policy prerogatives -- especially the power to declare war -- in the  Persian Gulf crisis.  </P></p>

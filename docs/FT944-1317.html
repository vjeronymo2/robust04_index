			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / Banking regulator urged for societies The regulation of building societies should be amalgamated into banking supervision instead of being left to a separate body, a Commons committee recommended yesterday. A report from the Treasury committee of MPs said that the Building Societies Commission could be absorbed into the supervisory division of the Bank of England. It called for building societies to be able to undertake a broader range of activities, limited only by what their members decided and what their supervisor said was prudent, but also to be more accountable to their members. The committee argued that the case for a single regulator grew stronger as societies diversified more widely into financial services. It said: 'There may be a point at which the expanding activities of the larger societies will require the supervisory disciplines of Bank of England scrutiny.' The MPs also highlighted advantages in changing the law to allow societies to become banks while retaining their mutual status. They said the government should consult the Bank of England about developing this option as an alternative route for societies that wanted wider powers. The report has been timed to be taken into account by the Treasury's own review of societies' powers and accountability, which is expected to be published in mid-January. As mutual organisations, societies are owned by their millions of members rather than by a separate category of shareholders. The MPs criticised societies, saying there was evidence they had 'tended to take their members for granted', and put forward some specific changes to improve involvement and accountability. The report dismissed the arguments advanced by societies against paying dividends or loyalty bonuses, and said the organisations should be compelled to be more open with members about accumulated reserves, and should consider the scope for such payments. It called for greater use of postal voting and for further work on making it easier for members to nominate directors. The idea of mutuality was 'under strain from the transformation of regional deposit-taking and mortgage-lending bodies into national multi-faceted financial organisations'. The committee's backing for a more permissive legislative regime and ways of making societies more accountable to members - such as by distributing 'user-friendly' leaflets about membership rights to all members - is in line with thinking in the Treasury review. However, if societies are to be given wider powers anyway, the government is much less likely to favour creating a class of mutual banks. Halifax Building Society, the UK's largest, advocated this idea, but has since announced plans to become a public limited company with a full banking licence after merging with Leeds Permanent Building Society.</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / Political Notebook: A forgotten war in the Balkans Sleaze, ministerial resignations, more sleaze. Post Office privatisation, Europe. The odd MP is even thinking ahead to Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget. The one thing no one at Westminster is talking about is Bosnia. The conflict has slipped from the front to foreign news pages. Television news programmes have become bored with images from a still-besieged but, in Bosnian terms, half-normal Sarejevo. The soon-to-depart General Sir Michael Rose, the British commander of the United Nations forces, merits still the occasional radio interview. But the average MP has forgotten that 3,500 British troops are spending a third winter helping to keep the fragile peace in the former Yugoslav province. Across the road from the House of Commons at the Foreign Office there are different priorities. For two months now, Bosnia has been Mr Douglas Hurd's principal preoccupation - so much so that he occasionally asks himself whether it has become an unhealthy obsession. It has not. A few weeks ago Mr Hurd feared the biggest rift in Anglo-American relations since Suez. The prospect was removed, but only temporarily, by the Moslem Bosnian government's decision to suspend until next spring its demand for the UN to lift the international arms embargo. Had it not done so, Washington would have forced a vote in the security council. London would have abstained and, assuming the embargo was lifted, would have ordered an immediate withdrawal of British troops. The French would have done likewise. The five-nation contract, which includes also Russia and Germany, would have fractured. Britain still expects a confrontation in the security council. President Bill Clinton is expected within the next day or so to meet his long-standing commitment to Congress by tabling a UN resolution which would set a firm spring deadline for the removal of the arms embargo. London and Paris will not support such 'automaticity'. The two governments will go no further than the existing wording of the contact group that lifting the embargo may at some indeterminate stage be 'unavoidable'. Mr Hurd's expectation is that the clash will be containable. If he goes ahead Mr Clinton will have met his obligation to Congress by framing a strong motion in support of the Bosnian Moslems. But, on British calculations, the motion will not gain the necessary nine votes to get through the security council. The hope is that honour will thus be satisfied. And the contact group will have six months grace to try to persuade, or rather coerce, the Bosnian Serbs into a comprehensive settlement. Viewed from the Foreign Office such a deal looks possible. Mr Hurd wants other elements - including for example confirmation of the Serb-Croat border and protection for the Serb enclaves in Croatia - drawn into the negotiations. That would increase at least the number of cards on the table. But to say a deal is probable would be to stretch the point. When pressed, the British will admit that success or failure will depend not on any new maps but on whether - and how quickly - President Miloslevic of Serbia wins his power struggle with the Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic. The contact group has been told by the Russians that if the blockade imposed by President Miloslevic was watertight, then the Bosnian Serbs' key supplies would be exhausted within two months. But it is not watertight. All sorts of people - including Moslems and Croatians - are willing apparently to supply Mr Karadzic's army if the price is high enough. Britain does not have the most creditable record over the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. At the outset it was too eager to please Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl by giving recognition to Croatia. It insisted that sanctions were the best method against the Serbian forces which overran a large part of Bosnia, but never did enough to ensure that they worked. It was too dismissive of President Clinton's determination last year to inject a moral dimension into the west's approach. Now the unity of the western alliance depends on a Serbian president defeating a Bosnian Serb warlord. If the latter holds on, the arms embargo probably will be lifted next spring. In those circumstances the UN forces will be withdrawn in a scramble. Bosnia, in the words of one member of the British cabinet, will then go the way of Somalia. Everyone will blame everyone else. But Bosnia is not Somalia. History as well as geography tells us that. It is in Europe's backyard. It is the fuse which could ignite wider conflagration in the Balkans and explode the precarious attempts to build a post-Communist international order. So Mr Hurd is right to be preoccupied. And some time soon others at Westminster may again start taking an interest in Bosnia's forgotten conflict.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ivan Rioufol (Paris) and Jean-Paul Picaper </F> (Bonn): "Questions Regarding the European Networks of the FIS"]    [Excerpts] Supposedly, the [Algerian] Islamic Salvation  Front (FIS) maintains terrorist networks in France, as well as  Europe, that have specialized in arms trafficking and procuring  forged documents. Yet another illustration of this has just  been provided by the arrest in Marseilles of a 30-year-old  Algerian illegal immigrant named Abderrahamane Messaoui. This  man, who is presumed to be a member of the FIS, was arrested  last Sunday by the 6th Central Division of the French Criminal  Investigation Department. Yesterday he was moved to Paris and  immediately sent before the antiterrorist judge Jean-Louis  Bruguiere, before being detained pending further proceedings.  Messaoui is suspected of being a "liaison agent" acting as a  go-between for Islamic fundamentalists in France and other  European networks of fundamentalists. [passage omitted]    "Tracked" to Marseilles, Messaoui was apprehended Sunday in  the city of Air-Bel, where he was staying with a friend, one  Kamel A. Some sources claim that the Islamic fundamentalist  was preparing to return to Algeria. He was charged with  conspiracy and stealing and receiving forged administrative  documents. According to the initial findings of the inquiry,  the FIS sympathizer supposedly took possession of forged  Algerian documents in Lille, a fact that would explain his  presence at the home of Chaid Eddour when the police carried out  a check last March.    However, the investigators will above all be examining  Messaoui's supposed relations with certain Islamic networks  established in Europe, more particularly in the Netherlands, and  especially in Germany. There are certain indications that  Messaoui was in fact constantly in touch with FIS "dignitaries"  who are currently refugees in Germany.  <H5>  Pacifist Policy </H5>   Most of them are gathered together in Aachen, where Rabah  Kebir, the former Islamic fundamentalist teacher and professor  of chemistry and physics, now turned foreign spokesman for the  executive body of the FIS, has his home. Last February, Kebir  saw all political activity in Germany banned, and so far his  request for political asylum has not been accepted.    Of course, the FIS headquarters in Germany maintains that it  "represents the pacifist policy of the FIS" and categorically  denies any links with the trafficking of arms or forged  documents. However, the fact remains that Abdelhakim Boutrif,  the FIS "smuggler" apprehended in Meurthe-et-Moselle, was backed  by an Algerian known to the German criminal police force (BKA),  who also lives in Aachen. Having arrived in Germany in 1993,  this man is alleged to be the FIS's most senior figure abroad in  charge of organizational matters. In January he already  chartered the ship MS-Ibn-Siradj to take on a cargo of arms in  Antwerp. Meanwhile, in mid-January 1994, the German Embassy in  Algiers sent out a memo announcing that the FIS was planning  shipments of arms originating in Central Europe.    In actual fact, some sources claim that the watchwords of  the  Islamic fundamentalists abroad are spelled out primarily by the  refugee FIS headquarters in Germany and then relayed by secret  networks set up in various European countries, including the  Benelux countries and France, of course, where the  fundamentalist mosques serve as agreed meeting places. This  international dimension of the FIS networks, a vague picture of  which seems to be emerging following the arrest of Abderrahamane  Messaoui, is an area that the investigation starting up in  France could probe further, no doubt in collaboration with the  justice departments of the other countries involved.</p>

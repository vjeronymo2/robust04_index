			<p>BFN     [Text] The Ukrainian Supreme Council set up a working  commission this evening for conducting talks with Crimea. It  has been revealed that Simferopol's delegation at these talks  will be headed by Sergey Tsekov, head of the Crimean Supreme  Soviet. Yevgeniy Saburov, the head of government of the Republic  of Crimea, expressed a hope in an interview with our radio  station that the talks will be successful, the conflict  resolved, and the situation in the Crimea will remain quiet.    [Begin Saburov recording] We continue to work in a calm  manner. Crimea does not respond -- tries not to respond -- to  provocations. Crimea is living its normal peaceful life. The  Crimean Government is at the moment working on a report about  the socioeconomic situation in the Republic, which is very poor.  The Kiev leaders are disseminating false reports that the  situation in Crimea is unstable and unquiet and because of this  people are not coming here very much. I would like to tell you  that the situation in Crimea is absolutely stable and quiet. No  one is really interested in these bickerings between  authorities. The weather here is marvelous and we look forward  to seeing you all! [end recording]</p>

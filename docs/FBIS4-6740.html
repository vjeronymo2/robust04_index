			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 21 (YONHAP) -- Prime minister Yi  Hoe-chang instructed relevant government offices on Thursday [21  April] to obtain his approval of all unification-or national  security-related policies referred to the Policy Coordination  Council before they are put into practice.    "Since the Unification and National Security Policy  Coordination Council is designed to review and adopt draft  government policies, all policy matters referred to and decided  by the council should now on be approved by the premier prior to  their implementation," the premier said.    Kang Hyong-sok, the prime minister's spokesman, said Yi gave  the instructions at his senior officials' meeting earlier in the  day while stressing that all government policies should be  drafted and determined through cabinet debate.    The premier stressed that it was unthinkable that, for  instance, the policy of allowing North Korean loggers'  resettlement in South Korea was released to the press before it  was adopted at the cabinet level.    "Prime Minister Yi asked his secretariat to caution relevant  government offices in this connection," the spokesman said.    Prime Minister Yi also told his staff to see to it that any  expansion of mountain roads should be made in a way that does  not damage environment, the spokesman said.</p>

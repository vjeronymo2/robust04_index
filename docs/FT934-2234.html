			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Tory right fends off challenge The Conservative right was in firm control of the party's backbench committees last night after fighting off a final challenge from the centre-left. Mr John Townend, a member of the rightwing 92 Group, was re-elected chairman of the finance committee by a large majority in a contest with Mr Nigel Forman, a member of the Mainstream group. The result marks a further defeat for Mainstream, which was set up in the summer to bolster support for Mr John Major, the prime minister. The group failed last month to take control of the executive of the powerful 1922 Committee of backbench Conservatives, which was captured by the 92 Group last year. Last night's result, which followed an unusually high turnout of 160 MPs, was welcomed by rightwingers and received stoically by the centre-left. Mr Townend said the election reflected backbench support for his views on the need for tight public spending control and minimal tax increases. Mr Forman said backbenchers had voted for stability. 'The Tory party tradition is to support the status quo. They did that tonight,' he said. Mainstream's only success was the removal from the 1922 executive of Sir George Gardiner, the MP for Reigate, who was one of the most vocal critics of the Maastricht treaty. Sir George was replaced by another 92 Group member. The group's failure to weaken the right's hold on the party's committees underlines the organisational ability of the 92 Group.</p>

			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Retail Sales Up 0.1%: Retail sales edged up a meager 0.1% last month after  dropping sharply in February, the Commerce Department said in a report analysts  cited as evidence that cautious consumer spending is moderating economic  growth. Sales totaled a seasonally adjusted $139.42 billion last month, held  back by sluggish business at department stores and auto dealerships, the  Commerce Department reported. Sales had plunged 0.6% in February. The weak  figures for the past two months are consistent with a series of recent  government reports that suggest slower economic growth lies ahead as the record  peacetime expansion stretches in to its seventh year. "I don't think we are  going to see a big slowdown or a caving in, but there is definitely a softer  tone to growth and it is being driven by softer consumer spending," said  economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. For the third straight month, overall  sales in March were held down by a decline in spending on autos, which account  for almost one-fourth of the retail total.  </P></p>

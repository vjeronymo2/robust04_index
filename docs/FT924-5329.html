			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Labour plea over Civil Service LABOUR last night accused the government of trying to deprive Britain of a national Civil Service through compulsory competitive tendering and the use of private contractors. But claims in the Commons by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, shadow public service minister, that she favoured testing public services against the market were ridiculed by Mr William Waldegrave, public service minister, and his colleagues on the government front bench. Mr Robert Jackson, junior public service minister, told Ms Mowlam: 'You are in favour of market-testing on the basis that no contract is awarded to any outside bidder.' Mr Waldegrave envisaged the development of the so-called Next Steps agencies resulting eventually in the Civil Service forming a 'relatively small policy-making core' with independent organisations delivering services. He said the National Health Service was benefiting from reforms separating the purchasers of services from their providers, and said he aimed to establish the same system throughout public service. Mr Waldegrave accepted that there should be a level playing field between 'in-house' bids and those made by private contractors. Inland Revenue typists and secretaries yesterday lobbied parliament to protest at the alleged threat to taxpayers' confidentiality in plans to privatise their work.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Blinov, Candidate of Economic Sciences, </F> Russian Federation State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy and  Support of New Economic Structures: "Support for  Entrepreneurship: Helping Those Who Help Themselves"]    [Text] For the Russian economy, which is traveling  the difficult path of reform, the task of development and  support of entrepreneurship, mainly small-scale forms of it in  the production sphere, is one of the state's main tasks. Another  year has passed--it is time to sum up the results. What have we  managed to accomplish here? The editorial staff asked  specialists of the GKAP [State Committee for Antimonopoly Policy  and Support of New Economic Structures] of Russia to answer this  question.    Readers of EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN know, of course, that, in  keeping with the law "On Competition and Restriction of  Monopolistic Activity in Commodity Markets," the Fund for  Support of Entrepreneurship and Development of Competition was  finally created under the GKAP of Russia. With the irony of  fate, the decree of the Council of Ministers-Government of the  Russian Federation on its formation came out on 1 April 1993.  Now the fund's activity is in the stage of establishment. Among  the problems being solved, it is necessary to single out the  approval by its supervisory council of the "Temporary Statute on  the Procedure for Disbursement of the Monies of the Fund." It  has been established that of the projects and programs already  submitted to the Fund (for a total of 400 billion rubles [R])  the ones to be submitted for financing in 1993 will be those  that meet the following conditions: the fund's credit rate is  from 100 to 200 percent; no more than 50 percent of the overall  cost of the project is to be financed through the fund; credit  is to be repaid within a period of up to 1.5 years; credit funds  may not be used to repay debts of enterprises.    The rest of the projects are to be included in the budget  proposal for 1994.    It should be stated that more than 50 regional funds for  support of entrepreneurship have been created on the territory  of the Russian Federation. Territorial administrations of the  GKAP of Russia are included on supervisory councils of the  majority of these funds and are the initiators of their  creation. The money in the funds ranges from R4 million (in the  Penza fund for support of entrepreneurship) to R1 billion (the  Nizhniy Novgorod fund for support of entrepreneurship and  development of competition). Regional funds in local commodity  markets have already rendered significant assistance to small  business enterprises, including in the creation of facilities of  the infrastructure for the development of entrepreneurship.    Thus, Yaroslav Oblast created a Social-Entrepreneurial  Center  with the participation of the territorial administration of the  GKAP of Russia. Its purpose is to render a wide range of  services for the development of the region's small business. And  one of the center's features is the fact that it operates in  direct contact with the Committee on Employment and is called  upon to partially solve problems of social rehabilitation of the  unemployed in the oblast (including rendering assistance in the  organization of their own business). Within the framework of the  center, it is intended to create a network of store-incubators,  in which it will be possible to carry out several tasks at the  same time: on-the-job training of students, training of  entrepreneurs in commercial activity, and selling of products of  local small enterprises.    Another of the innovations of this center is the creation of  an incubator--a farmer-run farm based on the rural lyceum for  orphan children in Gavrilov-Yamskiy Rayon.    It is also intended to open a branch of the center based on  enterprises undergoing conversion in Rybinsk. A priority here is  the creation of additional jobs in the sphere of production of  consumer goods and services, introducing new technologies in the  production sites released as a result of conversion.    On the basis of "Youth Housing Cooperatives" in Tula Oblast,  also with the participation of the local antimonopoly  administration, a business incubator has been created in which  entrepreneurs receive all the necessary information about how to  start their own business and where they can receive help in  filling out all the necessary founding documents and a business  plan.    In Pskov Oblast a training-entrepreneurial center with a  business incubator and a technological park has been created on  the basis of the Pskov training center. In 1993 about 2,000  specialists in more than 50 occupations were trained here,  including about 150 entrepreneur-managers of small enterprises  and bookkeepers. Enlisting Dutch specialists, they trained a  group of female entrepreneurs. This center is now selecting two  groups of students (on a competitive basis) for subsequent  employment in entrepreneurial structures. Classes will be  conducted by teachers from Holland and Sweden. It is assumed  that the Pskov business incubator will render assistance to  entrepreneurs in construction, personnel selection, information  on consumers of products produced by the small-business  enterprises, and other questions.    The Far Eastern International Center for Policy in the Area  of Small Business was created with the participation of Japanese  business circles. A similar center is to be created in the  northwestern region. Negotiations are already being conducted  with representatives of state and financial structures of  Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and administrations of the  northwestern oblasts for the creation of an international  business park.    Interesting work in this area is being done in Moscow on the  basis of MGU [Moscow State University]. The construction of an  innovative incubator is now being completed. The MGU Science  Park is oriented toward support of small science-intensive  enterprises and firms working in the area of ecology,  biotechnology, laser and optical technologies, and information  technologies. As of today, the selective competition has been  completed, as a result of which 30 scientific and technical  projects and science-intensive firms have become active members  of the MGU science park.    It is planned to create a large support infrastructure in  it,  particularly a telecommunications center based on two satellite  communications stations that will interact with international  communications systems.    A "Tekhnopark" has been created, with the main goal of  providing for effective development of the large Siberian region  in Tomsk Oblast. It is a regional interdepartmental center for  new technologies, commerce, and international relations.    These are only a few of the examples of organization of  support and development of small entrepreneurship in the regions  with the participation of the Antimonopoly Committee and its  local administrations. Unfortunately, the significance of this  work is not yet being matched by the necessary volumes of  financing. In this connection, one of the areas of the activity  of the GKAP of Russia is the organization of interregional  interaction in the sphere of support for entrepreneurship in  large economic regions, which makes it possible to utilize  objects of the infrastructure and limited financial means more  effectively.    In our opinion, it is most effective to render priority aid  to those regions where the local authorities are already  pursuing an active policy for support of entrepreneurship. This  is not only justified from the standpoint of the effectiveness  of the utilization of federal resources, but it also motivates  other regions to develop this work independently.</p>

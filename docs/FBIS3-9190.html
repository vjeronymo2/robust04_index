			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Tom Luke: "Partnership for Peace Is an </F> Absurdity"]    [Text] Henry Kissinger has called the Partnership for  Peace a "gimmick." Synonyms for this include maneuver, trick,  device, ploy, strategy, and so on.    President Walesa, of all the ruling circles from the  countries involved, is demanding most emphatically equal  membership in the North Atlantic Alliance (NATO). Warsaw knows  from experience that friendly pacts with Russia under any  Russian Government lead to thralldom. The representatives of  the other countries, however, act as if they know nothing of  this risk.    The protest from Moscow, shortly after Yeltsin's agreement,  against its former satellite states becoming affiliated with the  Alliance was an ominous sign confirming Russia's tendency to  regard these states as its zone of interest. This is not as  binding as if Russia were assuming the right to determine what  place the sovereign states in this geographic zone will hold in  Europe and the world, as long as they do not cede this right to  it. It is alarming, however, that the West is practicing a new  policy of appeasement, called Partnership for Peace, to the  detriment of the genuine endeavor for an independent democratic  arrangement in Central Europe. Has nothing been learned from  Munich and Yalta? In its incorrigible naivete, the West is  staking everything on the "democrat" Yeltsin, the proponent of a  market economy, long after he abandoned his former reform allies  to their fate and began to seek compromises with the  antidemocratic forces.    No normal and sensible person can condone the threat of a  nuclear conflict. The United States is rightly striving for  nuclear disarmament, but it is not its job to exert pressure on  Ukraine to surrender its nuclear weapons to Russia and thus  clear a corridor for the Russian armies' hypothetical invasion  of Central Europe. The tactic of "Russia First" is built on sand  by inexperienced U.S. bureaucrats. After World War II, the  Russian empire expanded within the limits tolerated by the West.  Moscow did not dare cross this clearly marked demarcation line  even when Soviet power was at its height. Following the Soviet  collapse, there came an unexpected opportunity to extend the  security arrangement of free states in the opposite direction,  into a region where a strategic vacuum had evolved. A  correction to the strategic map of Europe could anyhow only  involve a minimum number of states--that is, those that embody  civic maturity, domestic stability, successfully initiated  economic development, and the will to defend individual freedom,  and those that have a common border with today's NATO.    The vacuum between the power-wielding camps never was viable  in the long term. The affiliation of certain former satellite  countries to the Alliance today would provoke protests from  Moscow but no specific countermeasures because, at the moment,  Russia is too polarized and weakened. Nevertheless, in a year  or in a decade, after the installation of the next potential  totalitarian regime over the masses whipped up by the idea of a  Greater Russia, which can be envisaged, the West will not risk a  conflict, even for the geographic expansion of democracy. In  the event that the economic boom in Russia is unsuccessful and,  thus, civil discontent increases, the new totalitarian power in  Moscow will be compelled to conduct an aggressive policy in  order to divert attention away from the real poverty at home.    German strategists have calculated that, if NATO is not  expanded eastward, the FRG will be the first bastion of defense  in the event of Russian military aggression against Europe. It  is possible, therefore, to anticipate that Germany, in its own  interest, would welcome pushing NATO's borders toward the east.  The rest of Western Europe is descending into a state of tired  resignation and inability to defend itself against totalitarian  aggression. In this century, it was the English-speaking world  that derived sufficient vitality to defend individual freedom,  not only by words, as became the habit in the other  postindustrial democracies, but also by deeds. The situation in  Russia is far from being clear-cut enough for us to be able to  tell what combination of communists, ultranationalists, the KGB,  the Army, and orthodox fundamentalists will prevail and when.  Therefore, it could lead to a catastrophe if the United States,  in the role of leading global democracy, were to continue the  policy of appeasement. The Partnership for Peace is the exact  opposite of a policy of strength.    In an attempt not to provoke Moscow and, at the same time,  to  placate the nations that experienced the Russian grasp and are  monitoring developments in Russia with horror, President Clinton  is heralding the utopian Partnership for Peace instead of  security guarantees. "Democracy as far as the Urals" or even  "Democracy as far as Vladivostok" perhaps exists in Clinton's  dreams, but it has nothing in common with realistic policy. The  appeal to all members of the former Soviet empire to join the  Partnership for Peace predetermines the division of Europe into  the NATO sphere and also into certain internationally recognized  neutral countries such as Switzerland, Austria, and Sweden, and,  finally, into the remaining countries.    No claim uttered smilingly to the opposite will change the  fact that Clinton's naive delusion is actively driving the  countries that have just gained their independence into an  arrangement where Russia is assuming supremacy and the right of  veto. Moreover, this plan, which, despite its name, is  providing neither peace nor equal partnership, places the new  democracies, and particularly the Czech Republic, on a par with  entities that do not have a democratic tradition, do not respect  human rights, and are socially and economically at the bottom.    It is surprising that the Czech Government does not have a  sufficient quantity of insight and the dynamism not to sign its  own death warrant in the tradition of its predecessors.  Rejecting the offensive nonsense called Partnership for Peace  would be far less dangerous than signing it. This way, Prague  would retain its freedom to negotiate unilaterally on joining  NATO or to negotiate on mutual defense with certain select  states. The Czech Republic's integration into the Western  community would irritate Moscow, but it would accept it de facto  because the Republic does not have a common border with the  former Soviet Union. It is up to the Czech Government to  persuade the West that, as opposed to the other former communist  states, the Czech Republic qualifies as an equal partner. As an  ally, it would be more reliable, more stable, and more  respectful of human rights on its territory than many a full  member of the Alliance.</p>

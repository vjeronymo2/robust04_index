			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Announcer] A meeting between Ukraine's President  Leonid Kravchuk and former U.S. President Richard Nixon is to  take place soon. What does Leonid Kravchuk himself expect from  this meeting? Volodymyr Tatarenko asked him to answer this  question:    [Begin recording] [Kravchuk] The principal goal of the  meeting is to involve private capital in Ukraine. We are  setting such a goal while discussing this issue in the United  States because we know that, and it seems to me that I had  already said this at the news conference: No matter what credits  are granted to us, unless private capital is invested in  Ukraine, because it makes the bulk of the capital...[pauses] By  the way, do you know how much the United States invests in  foreign countries annually? Four hundred and fifty billion  dollars. Can you imagine this? Half a trillion dollars are  invested. But it is not the state that invests, but private  firms. These are the Morgan, General Motors, Pepsi Cola,  Johnson and Johnson, and so on and so forth. They have capital  and they invest it. So, to involve them we here have to act  relevantly adequately. That is to say, conditions, protection  of [investments], and a market itself must be created. However,  there should be promotion.    Therefore, the main goal of my meeting with vice president  [title as heard] Mr. Nixon is to agree on how to involve private  capital in Ukraine. This is the main thing. And to exchange  opinions on the political situation. He has relevant  instructions from relevant circles in the United States and he  wants to draw his own conclusions proceeding from his own  observations.    [Unidentified correspondent] And what if he meets the  opposition leaders?    [Kravchuk] He is welcome to do this. I will not object to  this. I will even propose this to him. Let him listen to the  opposition leaders. I would only want him to ask them to show  him their programs. Not just words, but programs. Because,  there are quite a few amateurs whose hobby is to talk a lot. If  he considers their programs and they are better and more  effective, believe me, we will glorify our dear opposition.

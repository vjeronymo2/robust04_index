			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Bid to create third largest Italian bank wins support Directors of Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bologna banking group, have backed plans for an improved bid by Credito Italiano (Credit), aimed at creating Italy's third-largest banking group. The Milan bank, privatised last year, plans to buy 65 per cent of Rolo at L20,000 a share, a 17 per cent premium to Friday's closing price. Today the two banks are likely to seek Bank of Italy approval for the deal, which would value the whole company at more than L4,350bn (Pounds 1.7bn). If Rolo's shareholders accept the offer it will end six weeks of uncertainty about the future of one of Italy's strongest regional banks, and show that further consolidation of the fragmented Italian banking sector can be achieved only if local interests are respected. Credit disclosed at the end of October that it planned to bid L19,000 a share for only 48 per cent of Rolo, to add to the 2 per cent stake it already owned. Rolo's directors dismissed the proposal as hostile and inadequate. At a meeting on Saturday night, the Rolo board was finally won over by Credit's commitment to pay more for a larger stake and the promise that Rolo's regional identity and generous dividend policy would be preserved. The stake will cost the Milan bank more than L2,800bn - about equal to Credit's own market capitalisation - and the two banks will have combined assets of nearly L145,000bn and about 1,000 branches across the country. In a statement, Rolo's board said the new offer would 'respect the interests of the Rolo group and its shareholders better than (the earlier plan)'. The decision was backed by all directors, including representatives of Rolo's largest shareholders, Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of Olivetti, the Italian computer group, and Banque Nationale de Paris. Rolo's decision is likely to kill off alternative plans for a merger between Rolo and Caer, the parent company of the neighbouring Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo). Italian newspapers speculated yesterday that Carisbo might now launch a counter-bid with the help of Cariplo, the unquoted Milan institution that claims to be the world's biggest savings bank. However, analysts said the price paid by Credit was already high, and although Cariplo has been watching the situation, the savings bank indicated last month that it would only be interested in a friendly takeover of Rolo. Credit was controlled by Iri, the Italian state holding company, until privatisation a year ago. At the end of September, Credit used its new-found freedom to issue shares and bonds to help pay for acquisitions. With the exercise of warrants, the two issues should eventually raise more than L2,600bn. Lex, Page 16</p>

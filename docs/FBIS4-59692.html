			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At the Iraqi Mission in New York yesterday,  Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 'Aziz received a delegation of Arab  and international figures participating in an international  campaign against the unjust blockade imposed on Iraq.    During a reception held by the Iraqi Mission in the honor of  the figures, the deputy prime minister reviewed Iraq's position,  which sees the need for the Security Council to recognize the  facts that are supported by UN circles in charge of implementing  UN resolutions.    Tariq 'Aziz said Iraq has implemented a great deal of these  resolutions, and it is now the turn of the Security Council to  recognize these facts and consequently lift the unjust blockade  imposed on Iraq.    The deputy prime minister said one member only; namely, the  United States, is using its influence to prevent the  implementation of Security Council resolutions. It thus  represents the minority at the Security Council.    Tariq 'Aziz answered questions by several members of the  delegation of international personalities on Iraq's relationship  with the Security Council. [passage omitted]</p>

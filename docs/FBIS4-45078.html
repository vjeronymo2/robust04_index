			<p>CSO     [Text] EXPRESS NEWS SERVICE, Washington--It is a measure of  the changing mood of the U.S. Congress that an anti-India move  aimed at cutting development assistance to India was defeated  unanimously in the Rules Committee of the House of  Representatives on Wednesday.    U.S. development assistance and aid under the International  Military Education and Training (IMET) is meagre -- slightly  over half a billion dollars a year. For the past three years in  a row, however, amendments to cut this aid have been routinely  discussed in the house and used by India-baiters to make  outlandish charges of human rights violations in Punjab and  Kashmir. At the forefront of such moves have been India's  bete noir representative Dan Burton of Indiana and  some California Congressmen.    Last year, representatives Dan Burton and Vic Fazio of  California managed to embarrass India when a similar amendment  to censure it on human rights violations was barely defeated  (231 to 202 votes) in the House.    This year too Rep. Dan Burton was flogging his usual  legislative agenda. He moved two amendments to the  Appropriations Bill. Had even one of them been admitted, there  would have been an embarrassing debate in the House on India's  human rights record. Embarrassing, because representative Dan  Burton is given to making outlandish charges. For the past three  years, he has been showing old, grisly photographs of some  militants killed in Punjab, creating the impression that they  were recent. A day before Prime Minister Rao addressed the U.S.  Congress, he claimed in the House that "right now in  North-Western India in a place called Punjab and in a place  called Kashmir, 1.1 million Indian troops are gang-raping  women." The Congressional response to the Indian Prime  Minister's address to a joint session was positive. Rao's visit  to the United States and his meeting with President Clinton also  created the impression that the two nations were serious about  improving their ties.    There is also the fact that U.S. Congressmen are getting  better informed about India, especially its economic reforms.  This is the direct result of lobbying by members of the India  Caucus led by Congressman Jim McDermott, by the lobbyist hired  by India as well as by the big U.S. Corporations in the India  Interest Group. Congressmen almost always listen to the voice of  American business.</p>

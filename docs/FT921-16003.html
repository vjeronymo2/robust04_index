			<p>920107 FT  07 JAN 92 / Appointments: Insurance moves INFOCHECK Group, the credit agency, is stepping up its involvement in the credit insurance field with the recruitment of Robert Lilley, a director with brokers Jardine Credit Insurance. After a long career at Trade Indemnity, the UK's biggest trade credit insurer, Lilley, now 42, knows the business well. While at Jardine he worked with Infocheck on the development of an on-line turnover policy which was launched a year ago with the support of AMA Underwriting Agencies and credit insurance brokers. ***** Roger Major (above), formerly a director of Meacock Samuelson &amp; Devitt, has joined WINDSOR as director and head of its reinsurance team. Christopher Pitchford is appointed md of Lyon Lohr (Life and Pensions), part of Windsor. ***** Neil Eckert is appointed to the boards of The BENFIELD Group and Benfield, Lovick &amp; Rees. ***** Stephen Bryant and Michael Newfield are appointed directors of PIERI (Underwriting Agencies). ***** David Wallis is appointed chief executive officer of BCS Management and Alan Cleary, chief executive of MERRETT's insurance services division, becomes chairman. ***** Hywel Bevan has become deputy chairman of SEDGWICK JAMES (London) on the retirement of Paul Dingli. ***** Michael Simmonds is promoted to deputy chairman of GREIG FESTER; he is replaced as group finance director by Frank Hitchman. ***** Richard Matthews has been appointed director of operations for the consumer insurance activities of the FRIZZELL Group; in his place Terence Trinder is to be appointed md of Frizzell Banking Services; he moves from Security Pacific Holdings. ***** Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen, a non-executive director since 1988, is the new chairman of WILLIS FABER &amp; DUMAS (AGENCIES); he succeeds John Wooderson, who is appointed chairman of Willis Corroon Americas. ***** Peter Downing is promoted to finance director of NRG Victory Reinsurance. ***** Donna Moore, 51, a former senior vice president of Disney stores, will next month take up the post of president of LAURA ASHLEY's north American division, which runs more than 180 retail outlets. ***** She takes over a slightly different role from the one vacated by Terry Smith who resigned in November. Jim Maxmin, the American who became chief executive in July, has been quick to stamp a different management culture on the group and run the business as a single international operation rather than a series of fragmented national organisations. He says he was particularly attracted to Moore's 'unique insight into brand marketing'. ***** John Poulter (right) has succeeded Derek Kingsbury as group chief executive of FAIREY Group. Kingsbury, 66, remains executive chairman until the company's annual meeting in April when he is to become non-executive chairman. Poulter, 50, joined Fairey in April 1988 and has been group managing director for the past three years. He previously worked for BTR, Thomas Tilling and Cambridge Instruments Group.</p>

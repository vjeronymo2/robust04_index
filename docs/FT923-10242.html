			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / Survey of Power Generation Equipment (11): Success through flexibility - Profile, GEC Alsthom Large Machines MODERN manufacturing techniques vary enormously across different industries, but the production of power generation equipment in an increasingly competitive global environment brings special challenges. The key to successful manufacturing in power equipment is flexibility. Predicting the product mix months ahead or even, in some cases, days ahead, is an 'absolute killer', says Dr Mike Lloyd, director and general manager of GEC Alsthom Large Machines. The average batch size going through the company's Rugby plant is just under two, he says. Coming off the production line are 800 units a year  - motors and generators - in a wide variety of types and sizes ranging from 100KW to 100MW, and higher still for hydro-generators. The need to increase flexibility - along with productivity, and responsiveness to customers' needs - helps to explain why Large Machines has just completed a Pounds 27m site reorganisation at Rugby to concentrate production into a streamlined, cost-effective modern factory, sweeping away 90 years of history and outmoded 'us and them' attitudes. The tangible signs of the four-year reorganisation, at a sprawling, 106-acre site (which employed 12,000 in the 1950s), include some tried and tested techniques such as design-for-manufacturing and flexible manufacturing cells. But the 'World Class' programme has gone a long way beyond that, to envelop total quality management, multi-skilling and teamwork. Results are already coming through. A crash programme of demolition and refurbishment has more than halved the floor area (to 600,000 sq ft), and the headcount has been reduced from 1,400 (in 1987) to 1,000. Yet sales have increased in the same period from Pounds 36m to a projected Pounds 60m this year, and, on average, production lead-times have been halved. Even from four years ago, the factory floor is now unrecognisable. The introduction of 12 cells, coupled with the reorganisation of production into a more logical flow, has drastically reduced the distances travelled - and hence time wasted - by semi-finished products. Where necessary and practical, equipment has been duplicated in order to speed up flows - such as the provision of a second small testing centre for testing high voltage coils and complete stators. In the machine shop, which is one-quarter the size of its predecessors, two new machining centres have been installed, each of which can handle tasks which previously would have required five or six machines. But high levels of automation are applied only to the extent that they can contribute to flexibility and quality. 'We are not pushing to get these machines running all day just to get our investment back,' says Dr Lloyd, 'but to get exactly the product we want, no more and no less.' The semi-automated approach has required the reorganisation team to focus as much on 'people' issues as on production techniques. Hence, training on new equipment was matched by company-wide training and communication, to create a climate of improvement to which each individual can contribute. Other important innovations include a sophisticated noise test facility which the company claims is the world's first for a power equipment manufacturing plant, and a new machine test department, costing about Pounds 6.5m. The centrepiece of the large machine test facility is a Pounds 3.5m cycloconverter, for variable speed machine production testing. The ability to test large machines, often in excess of 5m in diameter, within the factory enables site commissioning problems to be minimised before despatch. This is particularly important, because much of the 'intelligence' in variable speed drives is written into software that drives the electronics in the cycloconverter. The external aspects of the reorganisation extend to the suppliers: the core number has been reduced from 650 to 450, and Dr Lloyd aims to reduce regular suppliers to below 300 - and, naturally, to the customers. Last month GEC Alsthom showed 400 of these round a factory which can now be used as a marketing tool. 'I'm not saying we've got all the answers,' says Dr Lloyd, 'but we've made as good a start as any I have seen in this industry.'</p>

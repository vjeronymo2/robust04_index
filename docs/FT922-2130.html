			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / ANZ under pressure to pay Rs4bn ANZ Grindlays, the Australian-owned bank, has been ordered by India's central bank to pay Rs4bn (Pounds 77m) in the wake of the Bombay securities scandal. If it refuses to pay, ANZ risks losing its banking licence in India, where it is one of the longest established foreign banks, with 56 branches and post-tax profits of Rs350m last year. The Reserve Bank of India's demand was made by Mr R. Janakiraman, deputy governor, at a meeting in Bombay last night with Mr Bob Edgar, chief executive of ANZ Grindlays. The order follows a protracted dispute between the two sides over whether ANZ has any liability to repay Rs4bn to the National Housing Bank, itself a subsidiary of the Reserve Bank. The NHB paid the money to ANZ with a series of cheques made out in ANZ's name. The foreign bank paid the money into the current account of Mr Harshad Mehta, a broker who has since been charged with fraud, even though it did not have a specific instruction from NHB to do so. Mr Mehta used the money to pay debts to the State Bank of India. ANZ claims that it was acting in line with normal market practice in the interbank securities market, and that all banks credited brokers accounts in this way. Pressure on ANZ has been increased by State Bank of India's decision to repay Rs7bn to NHB on Tuesday. That money - not connected with the Rs4bn it had received through ANZ - had also been credited to Mr Mehta's account without the NHB's explicit authorisation. The Reserve Bank has put pressure on ANZ in recent weeks to provide against the possibility that it would have to repay the money to NHB. In response, ANZ said it had set aside the funds in case it had to repay the money - though it did not accept liability or say whether it had actually set up a provision in its accounts.</p>

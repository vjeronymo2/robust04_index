			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Books: Tooled to self destruct SELF-MADE MAN AND HIS UNDOING by Jonathan Kingdon Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 20, 369 pages JONATHAN KINGDON was born and brought up in East Africa where, according to current theory, humankind's evolutionary roots lie. He went to school in Oxford, returning to Tanganyika by flying boat for his holidays. On one such occasion he was presented with an immigration form demanding to know his race; so he wrote 'human'. An irate official told him to describe himself as 'Caucasian'. Kingdon replied that he was neither a cork nor an Asian. This early sense of the oneness of the human family anticipates Kingdon's enquiry into human origins and diversity, the themes of this highly readable book. Kingdon argues that human evolution has been influenced by technology; human form, racial differences, the variety of languages and human relations with nature, are all, he says, in important part the result of human beings' unique status as 'artefacts of their own artefacts'. The premiss is simple. Two key tenets of evolutionary biology are that living things adapt to circumstance, and that circumstances change. If one applies these thoughts to humanity, one sees that the development of tools and technologies must have feedback effects on their inventors' own nature. Food processing technologies obviate the need for powerful jaws and teeth, and make more diverse food sources available. The Promethean control of fire makes it possible to occupy cooler regions of the world, as does the ability to manufacture protective clothing and to build shelters. It also makes possible the production of more elaborate tools. The spread of our ancestors, thus facilitated, into territories and climates very different from humanity's Eden on East Africa's savannahs, is the source of human diversity. A visible example of this is skin colour. When humans migrated north into regions where the sun shines less strongly, their skins responded by losing pigment, so preserving the ability to synthesise vitamin D from sunlight. Mastery of fire, clothes-making and weapons technology made the northern migration possible; the 'self-made climate ordeal' which followed produced 'white' people - 'depigmented ex-Africans'. On this view technology is the interface between humans and nature, and plays a major part in influencing mankind's evolutionary direction in the same way as do climate, food supplies and other recognised factors. It is in this sense, Kingdon says, that man is 'self-made'. His book makes a strong case for this claim. The case brings with it other commitments which Kingdon himself acknowledges as speculative. They include the idea that Africans have had coastal connections with oceanic Asia from the earliest times, and that some differences now observable among the different human races are of very recent origin, perhaps dating back as little as 15,000 years. Kingdon sifts the evidence of fossils, paleology and geology to piece together a story of the spread of early man within and out of Africa. He applies concepts used by ecologists and zoologists to reflect on food and water in the evolutionary story, not just its availability as a determinant of migration but its influence on the development of agriculture and society generally. Knowledge of sources of water and food, of techniques in the culture of crops, and of other complex information, necessitated recording and transmitting information; this combined with other pressures to emphasise the importance of group cohesion and cooperation. It is astonishing how various the human need for tools has always been. Our ancestors used them for hunting, butchering, skinning, making clothes, building camps and hearths, digging mines, planting, tending and harvesting crops, and much besides. To make hunting equipment sharp, light and strong required skill. An excavation near Lake Malawi gives evidence of what was involved when a band of hunters killed and butchered an elephant. The animal was cut in three and handled by separate groups. Its tough hide quickly blunted their blades, so they had to make new tools as they proceeded. The amount of stone required for butchering an elephant is large, so the hunters had to carry tool-making kits with them. And they had to work swiftly, because meat decays in the heat. Kingdon gives a vivid picture of the ingenuity with which our ancestors faced such challenges. Kingdon draws a stark conclusion from his account of man as self-making tool-user: that today we have more powerful tools but less knowledge of nature and less sense of responsibility for it. That is why we present such a profound threat to our future. We have directed our own evolution through our use of technology; now we are in danger of ending the story by the same means. This is by now a familiar enough point, though it always merits reiteration. The value of Kingdon's book is that it sharpens the point in a powerful and fascinating new way.</p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LINCOLN BLVD. DEVELOPMENT  </P> <P> The proposed overdevelopment along Lincoln Boulevard reminds me of an  overweight aunt (overdeveloped Southern California ) who smokes (air pollution)  and has clogged arteries (the traffic mess) with a very large life insurance  policy (the financial benefits from the overdevelopment) whose policy's  beneficiaries are her nephews and nieces (local governments and developers).  </P> <P> In order to collect the policy's death benefit the nephews and nieces overfeed  the aunt, sweet-talk her, and encourage her to continue to smoke to hasten her  demise; and, thus, collect their money without regard for their aunt's health.  </P> <P> What the aunt really needs is to quit smoking, exercise (including her rights  to self-determination) and take the fat out of her diet. But the nephews and  nieces in their greed talk the aunt into keeping her bad habits.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, those of us who know and love the aunt, but are not her policy's  beneficiaries, suffer from the abuse done to her and are stuck paying her  estate's cost.  </P> <P> MATTHEW HETZ  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] On 2 June, a government source said that next week  the government will hold a meeting of its informal consultative  body, the "joint information council," on the alleged nuclear  development by the DPRK (North Korea). The objective of the  meeting is to discuss measures for coping with growing  international tension over the North Korean issue. The North  Korean situation has worsened since the UN Security Council's  presidential statement urging North Korea's early acceptance of  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) --  made in response to the nation's attempt to hastily replace fuel  rods used in its nuclear facilities.    The council was established in 1986 under the then Nakasone  cabinet to reinforce the crisis management capability of the  nation. The council is chaired by the (administrative) deputy  chief cabinet secretary, and members include directors of the  Foreign Ministry's International Information Bureau, the Defense  Agency's Defense Policy Bureau, the National Police Agency's  Security Bureau, the Cabinet Information Research Office, and  the Cabinet Security Affairs Office, as well as the deputy  director general of the Public Security Investigation Agency.</p>

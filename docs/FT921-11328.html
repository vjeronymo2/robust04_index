			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / Yugoslav presidency convenes crisis meeting THE Serb-dominated Yugoslav state presidency yesterday summoned Serb leaders from Croatia for a crisis meeting in Belgrade to try to persuade them to accept a United Nations plan to deploy 10,000 peacekeepers. At the same time, Mr Borisav Jovic, Serbia's representative to the state presidency, accused Croatia of blocking the UN initiative, raising fears that the ceasefire would collapse. In an interview on Belgrade television, Mr Jovic said despite opposition from Mr Milan Babic, leader of Krajina, a Serb-stronghold in southern Croatia, 'the greatest obstacle in my opinion is still the non-acceptance of Croatia.' The closed-door session of the Serb-controlled presidency was attended by Mr Babic and Mr Goran Hadzic, a Serb leader from eastern Croatia, General Blagoje Adzic, the acting federal defence minister, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the president of Serbia, Serb leaders from Bosnia-Hercegovina, the central republic and other top government officials. A western diplomat said: 'The meeting shows the tremendous pressure being exerted on Babic. They (Serbia's leaders) are trying to gain his approval. But Babic keeps vetoing the plan.' Mr Babic opposes the UN plan which calls for the federal army to withdraw from Serb-populated regions of Croatia after the deployment of UN peacekeepers. The army and Serb irregulars currently control one-third of Croatia. Western diplomats confirmed that the Croatian government was raising objections to the duration of the peace-keepers' mandate, and over who should control local police forces in the republic. Croatia will accept, if necessary, the six-month mandate being extended to one year. In addition, Croatia opposes the composition of the police forces, which would be proportionally represented. In practice, this would give the Serbs a majority control over the police forces in heavily Serb-inhabited regions of Croatia, and fuel fears that Croatia would not regain control over these territories. Mr Stjepan Herceg, a senior member of the republic's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, said: 'If Croatia did not succeed with the help of the UN or through peaceful means, it would have to use armed force (to regain its territory),' Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, reported.</p>

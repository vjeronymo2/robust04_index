			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Bavaria's CSU in unity bid for poll Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU), the ruling party in Germany's most independent-minded state since the foundation of the federal republic, was yesterday struggling to paper over serious divisions in the run-up to a bitter election campaign. The former state premier, Mr Max Streibl, who was forced to resign last year for accepting free holidays from a business friend, was facing bitter criticism and possible expulsion for holding talks with Mr Franz Schonhuber, leader of the extreme right-wing Republicans. At the same time, Mr Peter Gauweiler, the popular and populist Bavarian environment minister and CSU party leader in the city of Munich, is facing pressure for his resignation because of a simmering scandal over legal fees he has continued to earn while in office. Mr Gauweiler, the most outspoken critic of European integration in the CSU, which is the sister party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union in the Bonn coalition, held top-level talks yesterday with Mr Theo Waigel, the Bonn finance minister and party leader, and Mr Edmund Stoiber, the Bavarian premier and the real CSU strongman in Munich. He emerged tight-lipped, refusing to comment on the talks until today, But hitherto he has been strongly resisting pressure from Mr Stoiber to resign before his affair becomes an issue in the September elections. His plight is a severe embarrassment for the CSU, for he remains very popular with the party rank and file, and a clear vote-catcher in the contest with the Republicans for conservative votes. As an outspoken opponent of the Maastricht treaty and the process of European economic and monetary union, Mr Gauweiler was the man who coined the description 'Esperanto money' for the future single European currency. Mr Stoiber has now himself adopted a highly sceptical attitude towards European integration in his pre-election platform. Mr Streibl's contact with Mr Schonhuber is somewhat easier for the party leadership to deal with, because he is already largely discredited in the party and the electorate. The meeting was instantly condemned by Mr Waigel as a private initiative, and is seen in Bavaria as a reflection of personal bitterness on the part of the former premier. Mr Stoiber, as the man leading the CSU ticket in the state elections, is a passionate opponent of Mr Schonhuber and the Republicans, and has repeated his refusal to have anything to do with the party.</p>

			<p>920413 FT  13 APR 92 / Election 1992: Subtle race to be Speaker WITH the election over, the far subtler race to become Speaker of the House of Commons began yesterday. The dropping of Mr Peter Brooke as Northern Ireland secretary clears the way for him to succeed Mr Bernard Weatherill who retired before the election. But Mr Brooke faces a strong challenge from Mr Terence Higgins, former Tory chairman of the Commons' Treasury committee. Other challengers are expected to include Sir Giles Shaw, the Tory MP for Pudsey and a former industry minister. If MPs defied expectations and picked a Labour alternative, the front-runner would be Mrs Betty Boothroyd, currently one of the deputy speakers. Mr Brooke's strengths are the respect in which he is held by many Labour MPs, his sense of history and his regard for procedural proprieties. He is regarded affectionately among Tory backbenchers for his old-fashioned courtesy - but he may not necessarily be appreciated by fiery Labour critics. He may also lack an ability to control the Commons at its most tense moments. He is not authoritative by nature. He succeeded in bringing Ulster politicians to negotiations via patient progress rather than the well-chosen directive. Mr Higgins is similarly gentlemanly, but has spent longer earning the respect of backbenchers and is believed to be building cross-party support. He has not been a minister since the 1970s.</p>

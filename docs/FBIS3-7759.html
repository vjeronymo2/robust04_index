			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Sarajevo, Feb 28 (AFP) -- A total of 16  artillery shells landed in and around the airport in Tuzla in  northern Bosnia on Monday [28 February] morning, a UN spokesman  said here.    UN Dutch Major Rob Annink said one shell hit an empty  building and another fell on the runway.    He said the shelling came after U.S. jets in central Bosnia  shot down at 0548 GMT four Serb warplanes who were defying the  NATO no-flight zone over the former Yugoslav republic. He did  not specify the time of the shelling in Tuzla.    Annink said he could not say if there was a link between the  two incidents or if the shelling of Tuzla was by Serb forces.    Tuzla airport is, however, surrounded by Serb forces who  have  said they oppose a UN plan to open the airport in March to  receive humanitarian aid flights.    A French UN officer separately told AFP that a mortar shell  fell on Sunday near Sarajevo airport, which is held by UN troops.    He said the shell fell at 10:00 p.m. (2100 GMT) Sunday, 500  metres (yards) north of the airport, in what would be a clear  violation of the NATO ban on heavy weapons in the Sarajevo area.  [passage omitted]    The officer, who asked not to be named, said he could not  identify where the mortar shell came from.    He said three Serb tanks were seen from the airport moving  northwest at about midnight (2300 GMT Sunday), in what would be  another violation of the NATO ban.</p>

These meetings with North Korean  officials are intended to maintain contacts with the North  Korean team, which wants economic cooperation with South Korea,  in preparation for the settlement of the North Korean nuclear  issue. [passage omitted]    Although business circles are interested in the role of Hong  Sok-chong, who succeeded Kim Tal-hyon as chairman of the State  Planning Committee, they attach more importance to the role of  Kim Chong-u, vice chairman of the External Economic Committee  and chairman of the committee to promote the External Economic  Commission, who is part of the so-called "opening trio" along  with Premier Kang Song-san and Deputy Premier Kim Tal-hyon.  [passage omitted]    A figure who is in charge of North Korean affairs for a  conglomerate group said that "it is difficult to earnestly  approach the North Korean team -- which wants to promote  economic cooperation with South Korea -- led by Kim Chong-u,  because the North Korean nuclear issue has not yet been  completely resolved and its economic team has not been  reorganized." He added that "some progress has been made as a  result of ROK enterprises' constant attempts to make a personal  connection with Kim Chong-u." [passage omitted]</p>

Guzman was nominated for this position by Gustavo Tablada,  who minutes before resigned as parliamentary president during an  extended ovation. Marcia Quezada, third secretary, also  resigned amid acknowledgement from the deputies present.    A total of 56 deputies attended the afternoon session, while  the rest of those who have made a commitment to rejoin the  Assembly watched the voting from the hallways.    Tablada made a brief speech, limiting himself to saying that  he was fulfilling his commitment by occupying his seat in the  parliament.    Tablada's proposal was supported by the chief of the  Sandinist bloc, Sergio Ramirez. The Sandinist parliamentarian  affirmed that "a very clear message is being sent that with our  support for Luis Humberto Guzman we will work toward a consensus.    Ramirez said: "The UDC [Christian Democratic Union] took a  brave step by breaking a taboo deeply embedded in this nation's  unfortunate political culture." Ramirez added: "Tablada's step  is equally brave."    Other parliamentarians joined in to support the candidacy of  Guzman, who was unanimously elected National Assembly president.  Immediately after the election Guzman approached Tablada and  greeted him.    Armando Zambrana received similar support and was elected  third secretary of the Board of Directors.  <H5>  Internal Legislation Reformed </H5>   Guzman began his first speech as president of the National  Assembly by blaming the liberal-conservatives for the 150 years  of retardation in our country.    "The idea of exacerbating the crisis (through a campaign for  a constituent assembly) is absolutely immoral and crazy," the  new National Assembly president said forcefully.    After the 1990 change in government, "a change in the  political regimen can no longer be postponed in accordance with  the exigencies of peace, democracy, and development," Guzman  said.    We need an active and legitimate parliament, the UDC leader  said. He called on the rest of the deputies, who were absent  yesterday, to return to their parliamentary duties on 25  January, when sessions are scheduled to resume.    After the swearing-in ceremony, the deputies voted on  reforms  of internal legislation as established in a Justice Commission  document, the discussion of had been pending from the previous  legislative session. Six articles were reformed.    The reforms establish that members of the Board of Directors  should office for one year, while allowing for the possibility  of reelection.    The Assembly president's duties are set out in the reformed  articles, which also state that the Board of Directors will  determine the session's agenda by a majority vote.  <H5>  Ambassadors Call for Normalcy </H5>   Roberto Urroz, secretary general of the Nicaraguan  Democratic  Movement, who attended the morning swearing-in ceremony, said  his party did not take part in the voting because the Board of  Directors should have been more representative. But, he said,  this will not prevent the MDN [Nicaraguan Democratic Movement]  and the PSD [Social Democratic Party] from joining the regular  sessions later on.    "We hope more well-meaning deputies will start passing laws  to benefit the people," U.S. Ambassador John Maisto told  BARRICADA. The ambassador was forced to withdraw before the  sessions ended because of health problems.    Maisto said he felt "optimistic" about events in the  Assembly  and described as "positive" the steps being taken by the parties  which have announced their return to the National Assembly.    Papal Nuncio Paolo Giglio said he was optimistic about the  deputies' participation in the opening session. "I hope the  rest follow suit," the Vatican's representative said.    Chilean Ambassador Gaston Illanes said the ceremony was one  of great importance and noted that hopes are now focused on  complete normalization of the country.    The complete participation by the diplomatic corps was an  important sign of the international community's support for the  stabilization process implemented at the National Assembly,  several invited guests said. Yesterday the National Assembly  hall was not large enough.</p>

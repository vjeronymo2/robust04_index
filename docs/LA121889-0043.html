			<p><P> December 18, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S.-EAST BLOC TALKS TARGET HIGH-TECH EXPORTS TO SOVIETS  </P> <P> The United States has started talks with Poland and Hungary on preventing  diversion of U.S. high-technology exports to the Soviet Union, Commerce  Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said Sunday.  </P> <P> Mosbacher's remarks came a day after President Bush signaled that his  Administration is ready to consider relaxing of export controls involving  Warsaw Pact nations.  </P> <P> Mosbacher, appearing on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" program, was asked about a  pending request by the Control Data Corp. to sell several high-powered  computers to the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> He responded that "we'll have to look at each item on a case-by-case basis."  </P> <P> "We released middle technology, and we're going to look to see whether it  should go higher than that," Mosbacher said. "Eastern European countries, yes;  the Soviet Union, we'd have to be very careful."  </P></p>

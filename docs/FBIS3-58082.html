			<p>Language: <F P=105> Dutch </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Christian Democratic Appeal Losing </F> Popularity Among Voters"]    [Text] The Hague -- The CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal]  is becoming increasingly unsuccessful in the battle for the  voters' favor, opinion polls show. The most recent poll by the  InterView research bureau shows that the Christian Democrats'  attractiveness under Mr. Brinkman is declining.    If parliamentary elections were to be held now, the CDA  would  obtain only 38 seats, a loss of 16. Various polls since  mid-December have suddenly pointed to a significant loss for the  largest government party.    The poll results, which were announced on television  yesterday evening, also show that the PvdA [Labor Party] is  still facing heavy losses: 27 seats, compared with 49 in the  1989 elections. The VVD [People's Party for Freedom and  Democracy] and D66 [Democrats 66] opposition parties would both  win 7 and 20 seats respectively, taking them to 29 and 32 places  in Parliament.    The last day of the poll was the day before Christmas. In  addition, one-third of those asked said that they did not yet  know which party they would vote for on 3 May.</p>

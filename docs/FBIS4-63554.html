			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with People's Deputy Dmitriy Petrovich Bulakhov </F> by Vladimir Samoylov; place and date not given: "Any Law Is  Ineffective If Powers Do Not Want To Implement It"]    [Text] [Samoylov] Dmitriy Petrovich, you are a member of  the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme Soviet which adopted a  resolution "On Issuing Loans." When I read it, I recalled the  old days -- we call it the time of the command system.  Currently, we say we have nothing to do with it. Anyway, this  document is strange....    [Bulakhov] I am angry that everything is being done in a  hurry. Such an important issue -- issuing big loans to the  government -- demands more than a five minute or even a full day  discussion. A draft resolution was submitted to the members of  the Supreme Soviet Presidium five minutes before the beginning  of the discussion. Furthermore, this draft resolution gave  neither the reasons, the arguments, or assessments of the  consequences of this proposal.    [Samoylov] Even the budget of a family undergoes a longer  and  more precise discussion!    [Bulakhov] There should have been a financial-economic  grounding, consultations should have been held in various  legislative commissions, and so on. They did nothing of the  kind. This is a gross violation of a range of legislative acts.    [Samoylov] What legislative acts do you mean?    [Bulakhov] I am speaking about the laws "On the National  Bank," "On Banks and Banking System," and "On the Budget." The  most essential is that the Presidium of the Belarusian Supreme  Soviet is not authorized to resolve such issues.    [Samoylov] In my opinion, the precedent was established when  the Supreme Soviet Presidium adopted a decision to issue  trillions of rubles to the agricultural sector for conducting a  spring campaign.    [Bulakhov] I said then that we cannot resolve the issue by  violating the Constitution. Why did we adopt the Constitution  then?    [Samoylov] All of us remember how deputies congratulated  each  other when the Constitution was adopted. Currently, they  propose either introducing an addenda to the Constitution or  simply ignoring it. However, these are formal violations. What  can you say about this?    [Bulakhov] This is no secret. We lack money to pay wages to  the budget sector employees -- teachers, physicians, servicemen,  etc. Where can we take the money? As it is common with us, the  decision is very simple: To take the Belarusian National Bank's  profits and the working capital of the commercial banks.  However, nobody ever says under what conditions.    [Samoylov] They will probably conduct negotiations, as they  put it, privately.    [Bulakhov] If the Cabinet of Ministers begins conducting  negotiations and refers to the Supreme Soviet's decision, this  will mean extortion at the state level. Why are they doing  this? They say they proceed from economic expediency. However,  there is no such economic expediency. The problem arose due to  our government's "activities."    [Samoylov] What do you mean?    [Bulakhov] It promised to freeze prices and rents and to  raise wages on the eve of the election campaign. These promises  should be covered by money. However, you patch one hole but a  new one appears. The result of all this is that we cannot pay  workers of the budget sector.    However, the tragedy is that in one or one and a half months  from now, this will come back to us as increased inflation.  Prices will climb more quickly, the inflation rate will become  uncontrolled. Already in July we will have to pay for this  resolution.    [Samoylov] That is, after the presidential elections.    [Bulakhov] In June, we will cautiously cover this hole.    The danger is also in that we take the working capital from  commercial banks that, in fact, work for the economy. Actually,  we take this money from enterprises which could invest this  money. This is how we could finally ruin our industry.    [Samoylov] Are our laws so ineffective that it is possible  to  ignore them?    [Bulakhov] Any law is ineffective if the power does not want  to implement it.    [Samoylov] What will you do? Will you leave the people  without money?    [Bulakhov] This is the first time (however, not the last  one)  that we have had a nonpayment crisis. This disease is well  known in Russia where the workers of the budget sector sometimes  do not receive money for three to four months. This is the  result of our economic helplessness. We should formulate a  strategy of a credit and money policy which, to my regret, we  now lack.    This should be honestly explained to the people. However,  this is unrewarding. The presidential elections are just around  the corner. However, after elections, everything could go to  hell! Therefore, this expediency was dictated by political  reasons. The government, which had bet on Kebich, wants to save  up additional points before the elections. The poor people will  pay this bill.</p>

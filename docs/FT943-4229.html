			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / International Company News: German bank puts in offer for BNC stake A little-known German bank is thought to be behind the mysterious counter-bid for Banca Nazionale delle Communicazioni (BNC), the Italian bank being courted by Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino. Italian news agencies said the Bank fur Vermogens-anlagen und Handel (BVH), based in Dusseldorf, had yesterday confirmed that it had tabled an offer for a stake in BNC, which is controlled by the Italian state rail-way. Mr Publio Fiori, the Italian transport minister, has repeatedly claimed over the past few weeks that a counter-bid for BNC was imminent. He is trying to put pressure on San Paolo di Torino, Italy's biggest bank, to amend its preliminary all-share bid for BNC, to safeguard the interests of the state railways. BVH in Dusseldorf and Mr Fiori's office - which is reported to have received the BVH offer on Wednesday night - were silent yesterday about the details of any alternative bid, and San Paolo, the only group to have declared a formal interest, still seems the favourite to acquire BNC. Mr Fiori's intervention has irritated the Italian Treasury and the Bank of Italy. Last month Mr Fiori accused the central bank, which is responsible for vetting bank takeovers, of trying to force BNC into the San Paolo fold. He also revealed that Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna, another Italian bank, had proposed an alternative cash offer for a majority stake in BNC. That bid was rejected by the Bank of Italy. The San Paolo offer was first announced in March, before Mr Fiori became transport minister, and the two banks had hoped to wrap up the deal quickly. The merger must be completed by the end of this year to take advantage of tax-breaks offered under 1990 banking legislation.</p>

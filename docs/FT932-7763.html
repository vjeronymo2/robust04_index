			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: Warehouse clubs pay price for wafer-thin margins - The gloom surrounding large discount stores in the US as profits and sales recede AFTER two decades of heady expansion, has the 'warehouse club' explosion in the US come to an abrupt halt? If so, what does this mean for the nation's large discount store operators, who own many of these cut-price, no-frills retail barns, and whose 'everyday low pricing' strategies have dominated the stores sector for the past few years? The worries are real. Only this week, K mart - in the process of reporting an 80 per cent slump in first-quarter profits - noted that 'like-for-like' sales in its 114-outlet PACE warehouse chain dipped by almost 6 per cent during the three months to April. Waban, which owns the smallest of the five big warehouse club chains, reported a 28 per cent fall in underlying first-quarter profits. On the west coast, shares in Washington-based Costco, which has plans to introduce warehouse clubs to the UK, have halved over the past year. Even the mighty Wal-Mart Stores has been affected. Wal-Mart's Sam's Clubs division, the largest club chain, saw revenues from comparable outlets decline in February and March. That, in turn, fuelled Wall Street's perennial worries over whether America's top-selling retailer would be able to sustain its remarkable growth rate. Wal-Mart shares are flirting with their 52-week low. Such gloom contrasts sharply with the results established by warehouse clubs over the past 15 years. The concept was born in California in the late-1970s, when an aptly-named entrepreneur, Mr Sol Price, opened the first outlet in San Diego. Competitors quickly followed Mr Price's lead and club sales erupted. Having stood at only Dollars 2bn in 1984, they rose to almost Dollars 18bn in 1989. Last year, they totalled Dollars 33bn. These advances have come partly from new openings, but some operators - such as Costco - have enjoyed comparable store sales growth in excess of 20 per cent in recent years. Today, the typical warehouse club outlet comprises a large shack, probably on the outskirts of an urban area and stocked with anything from office supplies to food items, which are sold at bargain-basement prices. Many of the customers, who usually pay a one-off membership fee, are small businesses. To keep costs down, warehouse clubs carry a limited range of items (perhaps 3,500 to 4,500 compared with a discount retailer's 20,000-plus), have shorter opening hours, and use minimal advertising. Gross margins in the warehouse club business have always been thin, making sales growth essential to any profit momentum. Now, it seems, this is waning. 'Warehouse clubs have found it difficult to get any real sales growth,' says Mr Walter Loeb, retail consultant. Mr Jeffrey Feiner, analyst at Salomon Brothers, estimates same-store sales growth at Costco and Sam's will probably reach 5 per cent in 1993, way below the double-digit figures seen in recent years. However, this stagnation, say the pessimists, is only symptomatic of more fundamental problems faced by the warehouse club industry: Clubs are seeing increased competition from a new breed of specialised superstores. These have sprung up in many product sectors, from books to footwear, and, in many cases, have yet to prove themselves in profit terms. Such outlets are large (at upwards of 100,000 sq ft, they are at least three times the size of an average UK supermarket) and carry an extensive range of products within a clearly defined merchandise category. The Incredible Universe stores, which Tandy Corporation opened in Texas and Oregon last year is a good example. At about 150,000 sq ft, these outlets are about 50 per cent larger than the average warehouse club. They are filled solely with electronic goods, from refrigerators to cameras, which are proffered at highly attractive prices. 'These power retailers have well-informed sales people to advise on selection,' comments Mr Loeb. 'They carry competitively-priced products, so many customers no longer regard warehouse clubs as the lowest price source.' He notes that some supermarkets are devoting part of their store space to warehouse-style racking, bulk-packaged goods and selling at club-style prices. There is the lack of growth in the economy generally, and in the small business sector in particular. According to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the financial information group, the number of new business incorporations was on a steady five-year decline between 1986 and 1991, while business failures have been mounting steadily and reached record levels in 1992. In an effort to stimulate sales, some warehouse club operators have been experimenting with new product lines. Costco, for example, has tested garden equipment and professional tools, while others have added drug store products and optical services. The clubs' success is intrinsically linked to their very tight operating parameters, and the wafer-thin margins leave little room for error. Any significant increase in items offered, tends to result in a disproportionate rise in selling costs. Club operators, buoyed by the apparent success of their sub-sector, have been opening new outlets at a formidable rate. This has led to congestion in certain geographical regions. In the Dallas-Fort Worth area, for example, Sam's had more than a dozen stores by the end of 1992, PACE had four, and Price Club, one. Almost two-thirds of these outlets had opened over the past two years. That said, some analysts think the recent reaction to the clubs' sales slowdown has been overdone. They note that food items account for over half the clubs' turnover, and that food prices have been falling - meaning that sales in this area have had to run to stand still. That is unlikely to be a long-term trend. The warehouse club sector may have scope for some further consolidation, alleviating the congestion difficulties. To an extent, this has happened. An example is the merger of PACE and Price Savers, once owned by Kroger, the supermarket group. 'Similar to other retail sub-sectors, we believe that the warehouse club sector will have to undergo some type of shake-out,' say analysts at Salomon. What seems likely is that, if home market growth is slowing, warehouse club operators will be increasingly anxious to expand their horizons. This has started to happen. Wal-Mart and Price Company, have crossed the border into Mexico in conjunction with local partners. Price Company, in a joint venture with Littlewoods, and Costco, in which France's Carrefour owns a minority stake, plan to open outlets in the UK. Both companies operate a dozen or more club outlets in Canada. Price, while denying that overseas expansion is simply a response to sluggish conditions at home, has a joint venture in Spain and Portugal, where it is looking for sites in the hope of opening its first warehouse on the outskirts of Madrid next year. However, Price is more cautious about some pundits' suggestions that the warehouse clubs could work well in parts of eastern Europe. 'Eastern Europe is a procurement question,' it comments. 'One can establish clubs, but will one have products to sell?'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- US WAREHOUSE CLUBS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Chain                           Sales     Operating   Number of                          (Dollars bn)       profits      stores                                         (Dollars m)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sam's Club                       12.3           270         256 Price Club                        7.5           223          94 Costco Wholesale Club             6.6           184         100 PACE                              4.4             3         114 BJ's Wholesale Club               1.8            30          39  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Figures at end January 1993.

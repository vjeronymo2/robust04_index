			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Nikolay Yeronin and </F> Anatoliy Krasnov]    [Text] Moscow April 14 TASS -- "We are getting the  impression that our partners in the West, especially in NATO,  have not found the correct solutions yet", announced Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev in response to journalists'  questions about NATO's decision to bomb Serbian positions.    Kozyrev announced that Russia intends to sign the  Partnership  for Peace initiative, but has not yet determined the appropriate  date. "We are interested in a much more serious approach, not in  just discussing some framework document. We also have proposals  worked out by the Russian Foreign and Defence Ministries, but we  are interested in much more serious relations, which would rule  out surprises and unilateral measures, especially military ones,  in those areas where we should be cooperating most closely", the  foreign minister said.    "It seems that my last conversations with the American  secretary of state and the British foreign secretary, and  especially today's talk with French Minister of Foreign Affairs  Alain Juppe, allow us to hope that both sides will learn their  lessons from the recent events", Kozyrev said. "And we really  are thinking over a more serious and substantial format for  relations with NATO".    The Russian foreign minister was speaking on Thursday at a  briefing for foreign and Russian journalists on the results of  talks with Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is now in  Moscow on an official visit.</p>

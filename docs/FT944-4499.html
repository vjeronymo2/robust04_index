			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / Strong growth in factory output: Figures provide more evidence of faster-than-expected expansion in economy Economics Staff Manufacturing continued to grow strongly in October, official figures showed yesterday. With concern about the high rate of economic growth apparently one factor that triggered the interest rate rise yesterday, the figures provided further indications that the economy is expanding more quickly than expected. The Central Statistical Office said manufacturing output was a seasonally adjusted 0.5 per cent higher in October than in September. Manufacturing output between July and October was 1.2 per cent higher than in the previous three months, and 5.3 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Manufacturing growth was partly offset in October by a slowdown in North Sea production. The output of the mining and quarrying sector fell 2.8 per cent in October, compared with the previous month, largely because of a statistical discrepancy in the CSO's system of seasonal adjustment. Although oil production rose by 300,000 tonnes in October, it rose by less than last October, and consequently the CSO's system of seasonal adjustment recorded the rise as afall. The CSO said that this discrepancy reflected the fact that North Sea maintenance work was being carried out throughout the year, instead of being concentrated in the summer months. This apparent fall in North Sea output reduced the overall index of production by more than 0.2 percentage points. Consequently, the output rose only 0.1 per cent between September and October. This rise was lower than the City had expected. Nevertheless, the CSO pointed out yesterday that the index of production reached a record in October, while the manufacturing index was only 0.6 per cent below the previous manufacturing record seen in March 1990. The strongest manufacturing growth was in the investment goods sector, which expanded 2.2 per cent in the three months to October, compared with the previous three months. With domestic investment remaining weak, analysts said that most of this growth was probably export-led. Engineering performed well during this period, growing 2.6 per cent in the three months to October compared with the previous three months. The rate of economic growth may slow towards the end of the next year, according to CSO cyclical indicators published yesterday. The longer leading indicator, which includes data on housing, business expectations and financial flows, and indicates turning points about 13 months in advance, fell in October for the first time for six months.</p>

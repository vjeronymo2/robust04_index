No. 36&hyph;02374) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluations points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected areas. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2.

No. 15&hyph;14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky. The petitioner requests that the minimum volume of air reaching the inby monitoring point be 5,000 cubic feet per minute. In addition, the petitioner proposes to physically examine the affected areas weekly rather than daily because the mine wide atmospheric monitoring system, with a proposed additional sensor to measure air velocity, would provide the necessary monitoring. This petition modifies a Decision and Order on a previous petition, docket number M&hyph;92&hyph;94&hyph;C. The petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would not result in a diminution of safety to the miners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3.

No. 46&hyph;01437) located in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof conditions, certain areas of the return air course cannot be traveled safely.

No. 04&hyph;04695) located in Tuolumne County, California. The petitioner proposes to eliminate the use of berms during construction of the final lift on the tailings dam and place material on the dam in one-foot compact layers in order to comply with the California State Division of Dam Safety. The petitioner states that the height of the dam (200 <!-- PJG 0020 minuteslatlong --> &rsquo;) has reached a point where the width on top will not allow enough room for scrapers to travel and dump their loads if berms are used. In addition, the petitioner states that to maintain a safe work environment, mobile equipment that would work on top would drive forward only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Request for Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Persons interested in these petitions may furnish written comments.

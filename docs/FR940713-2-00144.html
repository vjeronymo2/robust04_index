These improvements will provide access to transportation facilities and related development in the area including the proposed Disney development. The pending FHWA action is a decision on a VDOT proposal for (1) a new interchange access to I&hyph;66 west of the existing I&hyph;66/Route 15 interchange, (2) modifications to the existing I&hyph;66/Route 15 interchange and (3) modifications to the existing I&hyph;66/Route 29 Interchange. There are no federal funds involved in the proposed transportation improvements at these sites. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Robert E.

In addition, the EIS will include a discussion of: (1) The widening of I&hyph;66 from Route 234 to approximately 2 miles west of the existing interchange with Route 15, a distance of approximately 8.5 miles (the proposed improvements are considered necessary to improve traffic flow along the I&hyph;66 corridor, accommodate current and projected traffic demands, to serve existing and future access needs in the region and to improve transportation safety); (2) the widening of Route 15 and (3) the relocation of portions of Routes 55 and 681 near the I&hyph;66 interchange. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives under consideration include, but are not limited to: (1) Taking no action (no build); (2) Transportation System Management Activities (improving present systems); (3) transit options; (4) upgrading existing roadways and build alternatives based on variations of typical section, grade and alignment and (5) combinations of alternatives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The subject areas to be studied in the EIS process will include, but are not limited to: traffic and transportation service, air quality, noise, surface and groundwater resources, soils and geology, wetlands, vegetation and wildlife, farmlands, visual, community impacts, historic sites and structures and archaeological resources, parks, wildlife refuges and recreational areas, construction impacts, secondary impacts of the proposed transportation project and cumulative impacts. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information describing the proposed action and study will be provided to appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies and to private organizations and citizens who have previously expressed or are known to have an interest in this project to solicit their comments. An extensive public and interagency involvement process will be maintained throughout the EIS process. Public meetings will be held at a number of locations. In addition, a formal public hearing will also be held after the issuance of the draft EIS. The draft EIS will be available for public and agency review and comment prior to the formal public hearing. Public notice will be given of the time and place of these meetings and of the hearing. A decision has been made to conduct scoping for this project and following publication of this Notice of Intent, the FHWA and VDOT will begin the scoping process in accordance with 40 CFR 1501.7. Times and locations of the scoping meetings have not yet been set. To ensure that the full range of issues related to this proposed action are addressed and all significant issues are identified, comments and suggestions are invited from all interested parties.

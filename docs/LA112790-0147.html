			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: MOSCOW;  </P> <P> FOOD IN RUSSIAN SPOTLIGHT  </P> <P> An extraordinary congress of the Russian republic's Parliament this week will  debate a set of resolutions, including one allowing private land ownership,  which the republic's president, Boris N. Yeltsin, says could have as dramatic  an effect as the law that freed the serfs 129 years ago.  </P> <P> The session, meant to address the growing food problem in the largest of the  Soviet Union's 15 constituent republics, will also put more pressure on Soviet  Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and his council of ministers, whom Yeltsin  accuses of making matters "worse by the day." He says private land ownership  will increase farm output.  </P></p>

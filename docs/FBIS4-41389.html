			<p>BFN     [Text] President Mircea Snegur has called for parliamentary  approval of the government-proposed economic recovery plan for  1994-97.    He said that as a first stage, it was important to curb  inflation so as to strengthen the entire infrastructure of the  market economy.    "If we fail to do this quickly, there will be a new round of  inflation leading to most dire implications," Snegur said.    The president spoke against emergency economic measures  calling instead for calm and regaining public trust.    At the same time, he admitted that initial conditions for  implementing the government program were bad: there was a  further slump in production, widespread stoppages and very low  investment activity.    Snegur named budgetary, financial and crediting policies,  industrial reorganization, privatization, utilization of the  workforce and social security safeguards as key problems facing  the government.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Comments" column: "Robert Lamb's Statement"] </F>   [Text] We do not know whether we should feel satisfied with  Robert Lamb's [U.S. State Department special coordinator on  Cyprus] visit and statements. But the basic conclusion is that  the Americans and others refuse to realize that the talks have  reached a real impasse. They refuse to blame the side  responsible for the impasse, that is, the Turkish side.    Lamb's positions create the impression that the talks are  advancing, that there has been agreement on many points, and  that agreement is possible soon. If his positions do not  indicate ignorance of today's reality, and they do not indicate  such ignorance, then they represent an effort to dispel the  impressions created not only by our positions, but also by the  statements of the UN representatives.    We voice our concern that we will return to the ups and  downs  of meaningless talks and that again the Turkish side will not  bear the responsibilities of another impasse. This will make  Rauf Denktas even bolder; he will filibuster every effort for  progress in the Cyprus issue.    We are faced with an impasse and the inability of the  international community to blame the side that led to this  situation. We understand that the government is awaiting the UN  secretary general's report before taking any further steps. We  just want to repeat that if we want to prevent particular  situations and create developments instead of following them, we  should act immediately. We should show our disappointment and  disgust that Denktas--with the support of Ankara--fools  everyone. We should also stress that we will not put up with  this insulting mockery.</p>

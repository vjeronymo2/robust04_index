BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CHINA LOSES $1 BILLION IN TOURISM  </P> <P> The massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's Tian An Men Square  last June has cost the People's Republic at least $1 billion in lost tourist  revenues, a Chinese official said.  </P> <P> "We lost $1 billion or so this year," said Chinese Counsel General Zheng  Wanzhen after a brief appearance at a meeting of the International Assn. of  Travel Research and Marketing Professionals. A panel of Asian experts said the  lost tourist revenues would total $1.3 billion by the end of the year.  </P> <P> Zheng was optimistic that the tourist trade would snap back. "By next year it  will be fully recovered," he predicted. "What happened in June and July is a  very minor event in the course of China's history."  </P> <P> Others at the meeting disagreed on how quickly travel to China would pick up.  </P></p>

			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Work, rest and pay: Talks aimed at averting a German strike Two hard men were yesterday locked in negotiations to head off a potentially ruinous strike in Germany's recession-hit engineering industry. In the blue corner, Mr Hans-Joachim Gottschol, 66, president of Gesamtmetall, the German engineering employers' federation: blue-eyed, tight-lipped and known to his adversaries as 'the hard man from Ennepetal'. That is the picturesque little Sauerland valley, east of Cologne, where he and his brother have built up a thriving business reprocessing aluminium scrap. Gottschol Aluminium is the archetypical successful small company from the German Mittelstand, and Mr Gottschol, the archetypical Mittelstand entrepreneur, the backbone of Germany's economic prosperity. He is a no-frills businessman, whose arrival at the head of Germany's most powerful individual employers' group in 1992 represented the revenge of his fellow small-time entrepreneurs, after years of domination by the smooth-talking heavyweights from big business. In the red corner sits Mr Klaus Zwickel, leader of IG Metall, the 3.2m-strong engineering workers' union, pride of the German labour movement and pace-setter for high wages, generous benefits and tough but reasonable bargaining in the annual rounds of Germany's industrial relations bargaining system. At 54, he is 12 years younger than his rival, but also in his way, an old-fashioned epitome of his breed: big hands, broad shoulders and close-cropped grizzled hair around a bald head. He is a man who says what he thinks, and does what he says, a lifelong trade unionist with a passionate belief in the good and necessary role that the unions should play. He was thrust unexpectedly into his job last year, after the embarrassing and disastrous resignation of his high-profile predecessor, Mr Franz Steinkuhler, over allegations of insider trading in Daimler-Benz shares. These then are the two classic adversaries who met yesterday with their immediate aides in a hotel in Darmstadt, just south of Frankfurt, in a summit meeting to thrash out their differences. They are faced with the threat of an all-out strike in an industry suffering its sharpest recession since the postwar German economic recovery began. Since 1991, 600,000 jobs have been lost in the mechanical and electrical engineering, and automobile industries. Everyone agrees that a strike would be suicidal, above all for the engineering workers. Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Rudolf Scharping, the opposition leader, have appealed for good sense and compromise. And yet the two sides have gone through negotiations in 34 rounds of regional pay talks, without any sign of rapprochement. For once, the traditional tables of industrial relations have been turned: the employers are on the offensive, and the trade union on the retreat. It was Mr Gottschol who last September served notice to terminate the current wage and holiday contracts - an unprecedented move, intended to underline employers' determination to win cost-cutting concessions. 'The fundamental cause of the growing unemployment is a profound cost crisis in the German engineering industry,' Mr Gottschol maintains. Comparative hourly costs in France and the US are 60 per cent of those in Germany. He wants real cost cuts of at least 10 per cent. The union came back with a demand for a package linking job security and income preservation: in spite of an unrealistic 5.5-6 per cent wage demand, it was obviously a defensive claim, with the emphasis on saving jobs, not on raising pay. As part of that, Mr Zwickel has thrown in a call for a temporary deal on a four-day or 30-hour working week - to save jobs by persuading everyone to work less. Mr Gottschol says it is a policy of desperation: it may reduce the absolute wage bill for those facing a disastrous slump in demand - like Volkswagen, which has agreed such a deal - but it would actually increase unit wage costs, aggravating the problem of German competitiveness. The employers' stance represents the conviction of Mr Gottschol and his fellow small and medium-sized employers that previous wage deals, including shorter working hours and disproportionate pay rises for the low paid, have had a devastating effect on wage costs. The current engineering industry working week is 36 hours, with an agreement to cut it to 35 from October 1995. Mr Gottschol says if there is to be any change, it must allow individual employers to negotiate longer hours as well as shorter. Only by going back towards a 40-hour week can they hope to cut their unit wage costs, he says. Mr Zwickel is terrified that by agreeing to a flexible deal - allowing plant-level bargaining to decide between, say, 30 and 40 hours a week - the concept of a national wage and conditions agreement will be terminally undermined. He suspects that is precisely Mr Gottschol's intention. The irony is that, behind the tough bargaining positions, both men are standing on shifting sands: both face a decline in their membership, as the industry shrinks and employers look for greater flexibility outside the confines of the annual pay round. If Mr Gottschol and Mr Zwickel want to preserve their positions, they are condemned to do a deal. If they want to keep their membership on board, they must make that deal mutually acceptable. They have more in common than might at first appear.</p>

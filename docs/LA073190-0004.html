			<p><P> July 31, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FREEWAYS TURN INTO DEATHTRAP FOR MIGRANTS;  </P> <P> FATALITIES: A GROWING NUMBER OF ILLEGAL MIGRANTS ARE BEING KILLED AS THEY DASH  ACROSS FREEWAYS NEAR THE BORDER AND THE SAN ONOFRE CHECKPOINT AS THEY ATTEMPT  TO AVOID DETECTION.  </P> <P> As more and more unauthorized immigrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border, the toll  of undocumented pedestrians struck by vehicles and killed on the freeways of  San Diego County continues to mount.  </P> <P> This past weekend, authorities say, three more people believed to have been  undocumented immigrants were killed along Interstate 5. In recent years,  border-area freeways have become deathtraps for undocumented people who attempt  to negotiate the busy roads on foot.  </P> <P> Thus far in 1990, authorities say, 25 people believed to have been in the  United States illegally have been struck and killed on freeways on the two most  hazardous roadway zones in the San Diego area. In 1989, there were 37 such  fatalities.  </P> <P> Including the most recent victims, officials say 115 known or suspected  undocumented immigrants have been killed since 1987 in the two principal  problem areas. Most are killed during the evenings, the most popular time for  illicit border-crossings.  </P> <P> Those numbers do not include undocumented people killed on other stretches of  area freeways and on other roadways in the San Diego area. Authorities don't  separate figures for those areas.  </P> <P> Most deaths occur in a dense grid of highways -- including Interstates 5 and  805 and California 905 -- that converge near the U.S.-Mexico border. The  roadways are often barriers to undocumented pedestrians who have just crossed.  </P> <P> But a rising number of them are being struck and killed 70 miles to the north,  near the U.S. immigration checkpoint north of Oceanside.  </P> <P> Unauthorized immigrants often attempt to circumvent the checkpoint on foot,  usually after they have been dropped off on the shoulder or the median of I-5  by smugglers. Often, they must must negotiate eight lanes of high-speed traffic  to avoid the checkpoint, and then they must repeat the hazardous feat in order  to reconnect with smugglers who have cleared the checkpoint in their vehicles.  </P> <P> Many of the victims are unaccustomed to the speed of traffic on California  roads. Women, children and the elderly are often struck. Sometimes victims were  unable to keep up with others in their groups. Most are Mexican citizens,  though some Central Americans have also been killed.  </P> <P> About half the victims are struck by hit-and-run drivers, according to the  California Highway Patrol.  </P> <P> Various government agencies -- including the CHP, the state Department of  Transportation and the U.S. Border Patrol -- have taken action aimed at  reducing the carnage, but the fatalities continue.  </P> <P> "We've got to do more," said Claudia Smith, counsel in Oceanside for California  Rural Legal Aid, which provides legal assistance to immigrants. "The problem is  increasing."  </P> <P> In response, Caltrans has taken a number of steps in recent years.  </P> <P> Among the department's efforts have been the pruning of roadside brush that  provides cover for immigrants; the improvement of lighting in trouble spots;  the posting of roadside flashing signs warning motorists of the presence of  pedestrians, and a public awareness campaign aimed at both immigrants and  drivers.  </P> <P> Caltrans now plans to install huge overhead flashing signs on the two major  freeways near the border zone in an effort to sensitize motorists to the  hazard. Most drivers are not aware of the possible presence of pedestrians on  freeways, authorities say.  </P> <P> "We're very concerned about the problem, and we're seeking solutions in a  number of ways," said Anita Yoder, a Caltrans spokeswoman in Sacramento.  </P> <P> However, a number of immigrant advocates believe Caltrans could do more,  including installing overhead flashing signals near the immigration checkpoint  in northern San Diego County. There are no plans now to put up the signs, said  Jim Larson, a Caltrans spokesman in San Diego.  </P> <P> U.S. immigration officials say the number of people attempting to enter the  United States illegally via the U.S.-Mexico border is on the rise, contributing  to an increased number of undocumented pedestrians.  </P> <P> Among the 25 killed thus far this year, the majority -- 16 -- were hit by  vehicles while traversing roadways near the border strip.  </P> <P> The other nine died after being hit along I-5 in the vicinity of the U.S.  immigration checkpoint.  </P> <P> The two most recent victims -- a man and a woman seen holding hands as they  crossed the freeway shortly before they were struck -- were hit Saturday night  at a point just south of the checkpoint. They remained unidentified.  </P> <P> On Friday evening, a man was struck along I-5 near the U.S.-Mexico border. He  was identified only as Jose Toribo Barrales.  </P></p>

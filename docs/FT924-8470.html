			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Matrix Churchill: Ministers warned to help probe MINISTERS who refuse to give evidence to the judicial inquiry into the sale of defence equipment to Iraq would be sacked, Mr John Major said in the Commons yesterday. The prime minister's warning came amid Labour allegations that the government was engaged in a cover-up over the extent of ministers' knowledge of the sale of defence equipment to Iraq in the run-up to the Gulf war. The allegations were repeatedly denied by Sir Nicholas Lyell, the attorney-general, as the storm broke over what Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, called a 'murky and black business'. Suspicions on the opposition benches were fuelled by unresolved doubts over whether Mr Alan Clark, the former trade minister, could be compelled to give evidence to the judicial inquiry to be conducted by Lord Justice Scott. Mr Major came to the assistance of Sir Nicholas as he struggled to assure opposition critics that members of the government would give evidence to the tribunal if 'invited' to do so. The attorney-general's protestations that it was inconceivable that ministers would refuse to comply with a request from Lord Justice Scott were brushed aside. After a whispered conversation with Mr Major, Sir Nicholas said that, if necessary, the prime minister would order ministers to give evidence. Sir Nicholas stressed: 'If anybody sought not to attend, which I find inconceivable, they would be unlikely to remain ministers for long if they disobeyed such an order'. Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat MP for Fife North East, sought clarification of the position if a former minister declined to give evidence to the inquiry. Miss Betty Boothroyd, the speaker, replied that as the inquiry was not being conducted by the House she thought it would have 'no authority' in the matter. Sir Nicholas rejected demands that it should be conducted under the terms of the 1921 Tribunal of Inquiries Act so that Lord Justice Scott would have the power to summon witnesses and cross-examine them under oath. He stressed that the 1921 tribunal procedure had 'disadvantages,' including the fact that it was likely to prevent any prosecutions being launched subsequently. Mr David Winnick, Labour MP for Walsall North, said: 'Could there be a greater contrast between the honour and integrity of the judge in this court case and ministers who apparently were quite willing to send innocent people to prison and whose record and reputation is such that they should consider as quickly as possible - if they have any honour left - of resigning long before this judicial inquiry begins?' Mr Ken Livingstone, Labour MP for Brent East, angered Conservative MPs by asking if the inquiry would be able to examine the alleged role of Mr Mark Thatcher, son of the former prime minister. He asked: 'Will the officers of MI5 and MI6 be under compulsion to tell the inquiry whether they advised the former prime minister of her son's arms dealings in this area and his own involvement in the shipment of munitions to Iraq?' Miss Boothroyd told him: 'That is not a matter for the Speaker.' In an exchange with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, the prime minister referred to 'extraordinary stories' concerning the matter, and added 'they must be clarified beyond any measure of doubt'.</p>

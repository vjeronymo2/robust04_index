			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLEASE PASS SOME MORE ADVICE;  </P> <P> HEALTH: IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES, AS OAT-BRAN TOGETHERNESS GREW INTO A MID-LIFE  HOBBY.  </P> <P> And now we continue "General Outpatient," the ongoing weekly saga of two  average Americans fighting the battle against the bulge of medical mis- and  dis-information.  </P> <P> As devoted viewers of this show may recall, we first met Dick and Jane when  they still believed that Food is Love. Indeed, Dick had courted Jane (he  blushes to think about it now) with a box of chocolates. The butterfat content  alone would turn his token of affection into a lethal weapon. But who knew  then?  </P> <P> After much time and many episodes, our friends joined the legions who abide and  try-not-to-die by the motto, Food is Medicine. These days, they take their  medicine -- low-sodium and hold the butter. In the salad days of their lives,  they have learned to use olive and eschew palm. They just-say-no to eggs and  yes to potatoes, which they call potassium, as in: "Baked potassium for supper,  dear?"  </P> <P> This transition was not as easy as it may seem to those of you who watch them  graze through dinner. At times, Jane notices that her diet resembles the meals  her grandmother had fled the Old Country to avoid. Dick wonders aloud whether  he was destined to live longer and enjoy it less.  </P> <P> Frankly, even a self-consciously healthy marriage such as theirs had its rough  spots, which fans surely recall. As passionate followers of medical research,  they have had their arguments. There came the time when she wanted to cut down  on cocktails because of a link found between booze and breast cancer. He, on  the other hand, wanted to hoist a few because it was writ that it lowered  cholesterol.  </P> <P> But these were the sort of family arguments that disrupt most homes in this  you-are-what-you-eat era -- arguments that have replaced disputes over religion  and politics -- as we sit around the kitchen table reading ingredients to each  other.  </P> <P> Recently, however, Dick and Jane had found areas of happy communality in  "General Outpatient." The past year had been the best of times when oat-bran  obsession had become something of a mid-life hobby.  </P> <P> This was a period of intense togetherness, not to mention aloneness, since oat  bran had certain digestive side effects that made Dick and Jane less than  welcome guests -- something our viewers wouldn't have known.  </P> <P> But now, we tune in one week after Dick and Jane received the news that oat  bran is not the miracle cure for cholesterol, that its value was in taking up  stomach room normally occupied by sausages and Brie. That the oat-bran mania  was madness!  </P> <P> Our couple seem as disconsolate as former followers of Jim Bakker.  </P> <P> Can this marriage be saved? What has held them together, this all-American  couple, except a devotion to their innard needs? And a deep belief that finally  they would find the way to perfect health.  </P> <P> But wait a minute, the camera pans in on Jane as she notices new medical  research in the news. Researchers say that older couples who drink coffee  appear to be more sexually active.  </P> <P> Tune in next week, when "General Outpatient" goes X-rated.  </P></p>

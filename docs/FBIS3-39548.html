			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Foivos Karzis] </F>   [Text] Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes and Hans van  den Broek, European Community commissioner on foreign affairs,  appeared extremely reserved about the measures the Greek  Government has taken on Skopje. Claes and van den Broek arrived  in Athens a short time ago together with German Foreign Minister  Klaus Kinkel and his Russian counterpart Andrey Kozyrev to  attend tomorrow's meeting between the European troika and Russia.    Claes said he does not hide his concern and will continue to  insist that the Athens-Skopje dialogue resume at the United  Nations, something, as he put it, that everybody in Europe  considers as the best way to safeguard the good neighborliness  between the two countries and, primarily, something that ensures  the smooth functioning of the European Union as a whole and  toward its neighbors.    Van den Broek said he will seek clarification on the  measures  from the Greek Government and will also examine their  compatibility with the legal framework of the European Union.    Their disagreement over the Bosnian issue is clear. Kozyrev  expressed his clear opposition to the NATO threat of bombings  and implied that any bombing would also affect Russia's  participation in the NATO Partnership for Peace plan concerning  the accession of Eastern countries. Kozyrev left open the  possibility of Russian blue helmet [United Nations] troops going  to Sarajevo to safeguard peace as early as the weekend.    Claes and van den Broek expressed their optimism that  bombings will be averted but also stated the conviction that the  strict NATO ultimatum was decoded correctly and both Europe and  the Atlantic Alliance should insist on it.</p>

			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / International Company News: Last Kassbohrer division sold off The all-terrain vehicles division of the private Kassbohrer automotive group has been taken over by the German arm of the Schroder Ventures group for an undisclosed sum. The senior management, led by Mr Erwin Wieland, will participate in the deal and continue to run the business. Schroders &amp; Partner Beteiligungsberatung, however, will hold the 'overwhelming' majority of the stake, Schroders said last night. The buy-out, Schroders' fifth this year, was among the five biggest recorded in Germany, the finance house said. The division turned over DM169m (Dollars 110m) last year and is best known for its Pisten Bully piste bashers which prepare and groom ski runs. Some 9,000 have been delivered in the past 25 years. It also makes beach cleaning vehicles and a small range of tracked vehicles. Employing a staff of 300, with 200 in the main base in Ulm, it claims to have a 65 per cent share of the European and a 50 per cent stake in world markets for piste preparation equipment. Schroders said yesterday the Canadian Bombardier group, which had long been interested in the business, had dropped out after making an offer considered to be too low by creditor banks and the out-going Kassbohrer family. The disposal completes the break-up of the 100-year-old Kassbohrer group. This follows the recent agreement to sell the Setra marque bus business to Mercedes-Benz.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BARGAINS: BEST FURNITURE DISCOUNTS ARE IN CATALOGUES  </P> <P> When shopping for home furnishings, one of the best ways to save money and  energy is the catalogue discounter. You can relax, browse through hundreds of  catalogues, and come up with a price that is consistently 30% to 40% lower than  retail.  </P> <P> The best procedure is to shop furniture stores or home furnishings magazines,  note the manufacturer's name and the model number of the pieces you want, then  visit a catalogue showroom. Many of these operations will even quote on the  telephone and save you running all over town using up gas and contributing to  the traffic snarls.  </P> <P> One of the better catalogue showrooms is Innerhouse, which will quote prices  over the phone. Generally its figures will be lower than the major furniture  stores at sale time. Recently, I was checking a Lane cedar chest that retails  for $599.95. A major furniture discount store had it on sale for $449, but the  price at Innerhouse was $390. So you don't have to wait for furniture sales if  you shop the catalogue showrooms and you still get a better price most of the  time.  </P> <P> The key to the cataloguers' very low markup is that their overhead is cut way  down by the fact that they don't maintain costly warehouses. This also allows  the cataloguer to represent a great many furniture companies.  </P> <P> Some of the manufacturers on the Innerhouse roster are Hooker (a pine  entertainment center that lists at $1,274 is $897), American Craftsman (a  five-piece cherry dining set that lists for $2,340 is $1,432), Lea, Nordwyn's,  Universal, Riverside, Heartwood, Corsican, Dino Marc Anthony, Hippopotamus,  Chair Factory, Kessler and Stiffel. A porcelain and brass table lamp by Stiffel  with a three-way switch is $309 instead of $475.  </P> <P> The Innerhouse represents manufacturers of categories other than furniture:  carpeting, window coverings, wall coverings, and accessories all at the same  30% to 40% below retail.  </P> <P> Delivery time ranges from three to four weeks depending on the location of the  manufacturer. You'll save if you pick up the smaller items; an independent  delivery service is available through Innerhouse and charges 6% of your  purchase for delivery.  </P> <P> Innerhouse is at 382 N. Allen St. in Pasadena (818) 795-1143, and at 2041  Pacific Coast Highway in Torrance (213) 539-4002.  </P> <P> Floor samples are sometimes outrageous deals. Negotiate on them. It'll pay off.  </P> <P> It's cashmere sweater time, and for those who have scratched this high-ticket  item off gift lists as being too costly, head for the annual William Kasper  Cashmere Sale to be held Dec. 2, 3 and 4 at the Holiday Inn Westwood Plaza  Hotel, 10740 Wilshire Blvd., Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Prices will be dazzling, starting at $89 for a two-ply woman's sweater that  wholesales for $139. This may be the last chance to get quality cashmere that's  affordable.  </P></p>

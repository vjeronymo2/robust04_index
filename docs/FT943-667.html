			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / The Lex Column: Deferred tax UK finance directors must feel beleaguered. Last week the Accounting Standards Board put noses out of joint by tightening up acquisition accounting. Tomorrow the ASB meets to discuss deferred tax. Though it will be several months before proposals are published and these will be subject to consultation, the board is leaning towards scrapping the current 'partial provisioning' system. If this happened, the reported earnings of some companies with heavy investment programmes could decline sharply, according to research published today by brokers Colin Stuart. The snag with partial provisioning is that it gives finance directors considerable discretion over what tax charge to report. Deferred tax arises mainly when capital allowances exceed depreciation, so companies can massage reported earnings by varying their investment plans. This sits badly with the ASB's drive to remove opportunities for creative accounting. But there are also problems with the main alternative 'full provisioning', under which deferred tax is immediately charged against profits. The actual payment of tax may be deferred for many years. A tax liability postponed clearly does not have the same financial impact as one due today. An attractive option would be to discount a company's deferred tax liabilities by its cost of capital. Though there would be debate over what the appropriate cost of capital should be, there would be less discretion than under partial provisioning. Moreover, if a robust model for discounting deferred tax liabilities could be developed for deferred tax, it would pave the way for discounting other liabilities and assets. That would produce more financially meaningful numbers and be a prize well worth securing.</p>

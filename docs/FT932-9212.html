			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Anglo-Swedish steel group in red AVESTA Sheffield, the newly-formed Anglo-Swedish stainless steel producer, yesterday disclosed a first-quarter loss after financial items of SKr53m (Dollars 7.2m) and said it planned to shut one of its three melting shops. The company will close its Degerfors plant in Sweden, with the loss of some 380 jobs, to concentrate production on Avesta in Sweden and Sheffield in the UK. The closure, which will cost an estimated SKr190m, will take place over the next 12-18 months as additional capacity is built up at Avesta. The company said its first-quarter figure was better than in the corresponding 1992 period, although it did not provide a comparative figure because Avesta only merged with the British Steel Stainless last November. Sales in the latest three months amounted to SKr3.5bn, compared with SKr11.8bn in the whole of 1992. The company noted that the weaker Swedish and UK currencies and lower energy and employer charges in Sweden had strengthened its competitiveness. But it noted that it was getting little relief from market conditions. The group said it was expecting its full-year result to be considerably better than last year, when it sustained a SKr564m loss.</p>

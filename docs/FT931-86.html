			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: IBM revises top-selling customer activity program IBM has launched a new version of its top-selling software program that signals the company's continuing shift toward supporting networked computer systems and away from centralised mainframe-based systems. The new software, Customer Information Control System (Cics) OS/2 version 2, enables companies, such as banks and retailers, to run transaction processing applications on networks of personal computers, workstations, minicomputers and mainframes. Cics - known colloquially among IBM computer users as 'covered in chocolate sauce' - is a program that provides reports on customer activity. The new version is aimed at computer users who are shifting such functions off mainframe computers on to network servers, such as IBM's PS/2 PCs. It was developed at the company's Hursley Laboratory in the UK. A significant feature of the new version of Cics OS/2 is that it is aimed at multi-vendor networks of PCs and servers running different operating systems, including Microsoft's popular Windows program as well as IBM's OS/2 . IBM also announced it was working with Apple Computer to develop software that will enable Apple Macintosh PCs to be used on Cics networks.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Public Law 94&hyph;163, created the Energy Conservation Program for Consumer Products other than Automobiles (Program). The most recent amendment, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (EPACT), Pub. L. 102&hyph;486, identified several new categories of products and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> equipment beyond the existing residential appliances for inclusion in various required and voluntary testing and information programs to promote energy efficiency. Voluntary programs were specified for commercial office equipment, window rating and labeling, and luminaires.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As described in section 126 of EPACT, the Secretary of Energy, after consulting with industry associations and other interested organizations, is to provide technical and financial assistance to support a voluntary national testing and information program for those types of luminaires that are widely used, and for which there is a potential for significant energy savings as a result of such programs. Such program will provide information that, when conveyed to consumers, will enable purchasers of the equipment to make more informed decisions about the energy efficiency and costs of alternative products.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The voluntary program should determine the luminaires to be covered, include specifications for testing procedures, and include information, which may be disseminated through catalogs, trade publications, labels, or other mechanisms, that will allow consumers to assess the energy consumption and potential cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings of alternative products. Such program shall be developed by an appropriate organization (composed of interested parties) according to commonly accepted procedures for the development of national testing procedures and labeling programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Not later than three years after the date of enactment of EPACT (October 24, 1995), the Secretary shall make a determination as to whether the voluntary program is positioned to achieve the objectives established for the testing and rating of luminaires. If the Secretary determines that the voluntary program is not consistent with the objectives of the legislation, the Secretary shall, after consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, develop test procedures for luminaires. One year later, the Federal Trade Commission would prescribe labeling rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the passage of EPACT, the Department of Energy has monitored the efforts of the luminaire industry to develop a testing and information program through the National Lighting Collaborative (NLC or Collaborative), a working group composed of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American Lighting Association, lighting manufacturers, environmental organizations, designers, national laboratories, and other lighting professionals. On May 24, 1994, DOE held a public meeting to invite interested parties to offer suggestions concerning methods of evaluation and to obtain updates on the progress of the Collaborative's voluntary program. Subsequent comments were invited through June 15, 1994. Additional suggestions and information were supplied by the Collaborative on July 28, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the meeting is twofold: (1) to discuss comments on the proposed evaluation criteria; and (2) to provide an opportunity to inform DOE on the progress of the voluntary program and establish a timetable for the evaluation of the program. After the meeting and comment period, the Department will consider all comments and publish the evaluation criteria in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> 4. Public Meeting Procedure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The meeting will be informal. Participants are requested to review a copy of the draft evaluation criteria before the meeting. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Issued in Washington, DC, December 20, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Christine A.

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / No payout as LIG slumps London International Group surprised the market yesterday by announcing interim losses, warning of 'very substantial' restructuring charges and passing the dividend. Its plans include the sale of large parts of the business and a capital reconstruction. Mr Alan Woltz, non-executive chairman, is to resign once a replacement is found, probably by the financial year-end in March. The shares slumped to 95p initially before recovering to 111p, a loss of 28p on the day. They have fallen from 272p in January. The results followed a profit warning and the resignation of Mr Tony Butterworth as chief executive in September. Yesterday Mr Nick Hodges, the new chief executive, said 'we are aware of the criticisms of the group over the non-delivery of promises. We intend to start a new era at LIG.' He added that the new management team, which includes Mr James Tyrell as finance director, had 'only got one chance' to sort out the group's problems but he was sure it could be returned to an acceptable level of profitability. A strategic review of the business had already been carried out, and LIG had decided to sell its ColourCare photo-processing division and some of its health and beauty brands. It would concentrate on its 'thin film technology' products, notably condoms, surgeons' and specialist gloves. It would build on global brands such as Durex condoms and Biogel surgeons' gloves. There would also be further rationalisation, and 2,000 of the 7,000 jobs in the health and personal products division would go worldwide. Analysts said they could not predict full-year figures because of the exceptional charges of these moves which could run into 'tens of millions,' one said. The half-year showed a pre-tax loss of Pounds 5.1m compared with a profit of Pounds 15.5m. Net debt had risen from Pounds 127.7m on March 31 to Pounds 153.9m on September 30. Shareholders' funds were Pounds 109.4m and there were Pounds 53.9m of intangible assets on the balance sheet. Mr Hodges said a rights issue was not necessary as disposals should raise 'a substantial sum'. He said the group was not breaching covenants on its loans and had the full support of its banks. The loss-making photo-processing division, which has more than 30 per cent of the UK market, was valued in the books at more than Pounds 30m, he said. It was now 'a question of getting the best available price not waiting for what might come'. The group could also sell some of its toiletries brands, which include Woodward's gripe water, Wrights Coal Tar Soap, Galloways and Buttercup cough mixtures, Eucryl tooth powder, and, in Italy, the Mister Baby range of baby products.

			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / The Maastricht Vote: Sceptics focus on treaty details AMONG ALL the lists of potential Tory rebels on Maastricht, the document at the centre of the row is in danger of going unnoticed - except by the Euro-sceptics who have examined it clause by clause and swap detailed references to articles and protocols. The 130 or so pages of the English text of the treaty include the changes to the existing treaties about the European Economic Community - or the European Community as it will now become - as well as 17 protocols and 33 declarations. The most important changes to the previous treaties relate to economic and monetary union. Those would set up in three stages the replacement of national currencies with the Ecu as the single European currency, and the replacement of national central banks with an independent European central bank. The transitional provisions include the setting up of a European Monetary Institute to strengthen monetary co-operation and facilitate the use of the Ecu; and progress by the member states towards low inflation, stable exchange rates and low budget deficits, as the 'convergence criteria' for the basis of economic and monetary union. The UK has secured an 'opt-out' from the final stage of economic and monetary union, but the treaty language makes clear that all member states, whether or not they are likely to be included in the single currency, are expected to work towards meeting the convergence criteria. Other changes extend the Community's policy range in some areas and give the Community a new role in others such as industrial policy, research and technological development and trans-European transport and telecommunications networks. The treaty extends the Community's role in environmental policy and paves the way for it to have a say in civil protection, energy and tourism. Separately from the amendments to earlier treaties, the Maastricht agreement pro-vides for intergovernmental co-operation in foreign and home affairs. On foreign and security policy, it is the Council of Ministers that will decide what should be covered in a common policy although the Commission will be 'fully associated' with the policy. Most foreign and security policy decisions will have to be taken unanimously, but some implementation decisions will be by qualified majority voting. The Western European Union, the European element of Nato, is given a prominent role in the defence implications of the foreign policy. The most significant declaration - and the area of the other UK opt-out - is that on social policy. The UK will be unable to take part in the discussions about improved working conditions and social protection, but will not have to bear the costs of implementing those policies. Of the other provisions, the most controversial at Westminster is the setting up of a 'cohesion fund' to help less developed countries in the Community. Beyond the changes themselves, the language of Maastricht is itself an issue at Westminster. In particular, its references to marking a new stage in creating 'an ever closer union' and its establishment of 'citizenship of the union' will doubtless be raised today whenever the government argues that the treaty is a turning point away from European centralisation.</p>

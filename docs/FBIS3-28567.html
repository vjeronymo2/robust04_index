The officials said the decision was reached at the inaugural  session of an administrative reform promotion group presided  over by Hosokawa.    They said the program, based on the goal of total removal of  regulations, calls for abolishing controls in 866 areas and  easing them in 725 categories.    A total of 160 areas was added to the scope of deregulation  announced by the government last December, they said.    To implement the deregulation, about 60 existing laws have  to  be revised, and the government will submit a host of  law-revising bills to the current session of the Diet for  approval, they said.    The officials said the people will be informed of the  progress of deregulation through a white paper to be released by  the government.    The deregulation includes an easing of automobile inspection  requirements and paves the way for small-scale brewers to  produce local brand beer, the officials said.</p>

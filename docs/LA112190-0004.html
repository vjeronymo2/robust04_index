			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDAMENTALISM AND UNREST IN INDIA  </P> <P> India is the birthplace of four established religions: Hinduism, Buddhism,  Sikhism and Jainism. A vast majority of Hindus in the world live there.  </P> <P> So do Sikhs. So do Jains. Many Buddhists live there. And India is the second  most Muslim-populous nation in the world. Yes, there are more Muslims in India  than in Pakistan.  </P> <P> In almost any city in India, you can find a Hindu temple, a Christian church, a  Jain temple, a Muslim mosque and a Sikh gurdwara within a block of each other.  Hindus, Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists intermarry and visit each other's places of  worship.  </P> <P> No nation in the world can lay claim to such an evolving diversity, to such  distinctions. Please give India understanding.  </P> <P> S. NARASIMHA REDDY, Torrance  </P></p>

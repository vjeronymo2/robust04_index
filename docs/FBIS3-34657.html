			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Taysir Khalid, member of the Political Bureau of the  Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine [DFLP], has  emphasized that the front will continue to struggle alongside  all Palestinian nationalist forces, organizations, and  personalities against the Gaza-Jericho agreement and all forms  of its implementation, including the Cairo agreement, signed by  PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shim'on  Peres.    Khalid added that the signing of the Cairo agreement by  Yasir  'Arafat is illegitimate and is not binding on the PLO or the  Palestinian people because 'Arafat did not refer to any of the  PLO institutions that have a say on the present and future of  the Palestinian people.    Khalid urged the PLO Executive Committee chairman to respect  the Palestinian people's will, and to subject the Gaza-Jericho  agreement to a referendum among the Palestinians inside and  outside the occupied territories. He said this referendum would  let the Palestinians express their opinion on this agreement and  this destructive policy that furthers division within the PLO  and the Palestinian people, sacrifices the Palestinian people's  higher national interests, and changes the territories into  protectorates under Israeli sovereignty.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The ANC [African National Congress] has announced a  campaign to rebuild the social fabric in violence torn East Rand  townships. Announcing the campaign at a Johannesburg media  conference, ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging]  Regional Executive Committee member Jessie Duarte said the aim  of the campaign is to build peace consciousness in the area.  She said the peace plan is a call from all South Africans for  help to build the social fabric in the area. Organizations  across the political spectrum have been invited to a meeting on  15 January. This is when a working group will lay the  foundation for the campaign.    Duarte says among other plans, the ANC has proposed that  people from outside the East Rand, irrespective of political  affiliation and race, spend time and talk to residents in  violence plagued areas. She says the campaign was initiated by  the ANC, but it is for all South Africa who need to hold a free  and fair election and a peaceful transition.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> With regard to your Critic's Corner column on Dec. 3, I have no idea what  section or portion of the television-viewing population I represent, but I  disagree with the entire thrust of the piece. I thoroughly enjoy reenactments!  I think Fox TV popularized the "simulated reenactment" concept on contemporary  television, which would help explain what I believe is Fox's steady rise in  grass-roots popularity of late: It knows what the public wants. My verdict is  still out on whether reenactments are acceptable for actual, current on-air  news items; but if they are clearly labeled, any reasonable person will accept  them as such.  </P> <P> McCall, Westchester  </P></p>

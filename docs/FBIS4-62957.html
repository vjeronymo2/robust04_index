			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Vladimir Nadein report: "Duma and Senate Vote Against </F> Their Presidents -- But This Is Unlikely To Affect Situation in  Bosnia"]    [Text] Washington -- At the same time as the Russian  parliament's lower house -- the State Duma -- voted in favor of  lifting the embargo on trade with Yugoslavia, the upper house of  the U.S. Congress -- the Senate -- spoke out in favor of lifting  restrictions on the sale of weapons to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Both  in Moscow and Washington a further step has been taken toward  the position expounded by former U.S. Secretary of State  Eagleburger to the effect that, if people are firmly intent on  killing one another, then everybody else has to stand aside and  grant the belligerent parties freedom of action until their  ardor abates.    The economic blockade established by decision of the United  Nations affects Serbia and Montenegro. It does not apply to  Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia.    However, all former SFRY countries find themselves under  strict observation in the matter of weapons deliveries. Experts  believe that this embargo is advantageous to Serbia and places  its rivals in a known losing position. This concerns Bosnia in  particular, insofar as Yugoslavia's entire defense industry is  concentrated in Serbia and, to a lesser degree, in Croatia.    Recent reports that the Iranian Government, in conjunction  with those of certain other Muslim states, has been secretly  supplying weapons to the Bosnian Government -- led, as it is, by  fellow believers -- placed American legislators in a somewhat  awkward position. Iran is still on the blacklist of countries  which, according to information from the U.S. State Department,  support international terrorism.    However, on Capitol Hill, where the dome of the famous  Congress Building rises over Washington, irritation over the  half-hearted and inconsistent foreign policy of the Clinton  administration has long been evident.    This concerns not only the Bosnians, whose sufferings and  tortures have long since become not so much an indictment of  Clinton's indecisiveness as a weapon in the hands of his  political opponents. The views of the president and a great  many legislators also differ over the thrust of the crisis in  Haiti, and the means through which to avert the highly likely  appearance of nuclear weapons in North Korean hands.    Alongside the number of senators and congressmen supporting  the continuation of trade-related most-favored-nation status for  China, despite its leaders harsh suppression of any political  opposition, the ranks of those pushing for trade sanctions  against China are swelling.    Russia, having long been almost the only spot on the  political map to enjoy the conciliation and accord of all the  main U.S. political forces, is also becoming a trouble spot.  Clinton is being criticized for overly blatant pro-Russianism  and malleability in implementing NATO's Partnership for Peace  program in granting Russia, the critics claim, a special right  of veto on the full-fledged entry into NATO of certain former  Warsaw Pact members.    In voting by an overwhelming majority to halt the embargo on  the delivery of arms to Bosnia, the Senate took "an easy,  no-cost decision." Naturally, it avoids the introduction of  American troops into the zone of hostilities, and even air  strikes, all of which are fraught with possible losses of  American lives. However, the prospect of the implementation of  both resolutions -- that of the Russian Duma and the American  Senate -- is not completely inoffensive. The appearance of  heavy weaponry on the Bosnian side will jeopardize French,  British, Ukrainian, and Russian lives, and will quite likely  lead to their speedy withdrawal from Yugoslavia.    The history of democracy has demonstrated time and again  that  the implementation of foreign policy cannot be realized by  parliamentary ballot, even if the fantasy of an irreproachable  parliament is brought into play. So it is not difficult to  predict that both governments, Russian and American alike, will  try to hide behind polite smiles their irritation at the  legislators' interference in the prerogatives of the executive.    During the Cold War, the lines of the division of interests  were drawn so clearly that there was little room for opinions  beyond the bounds of a simple "yes" and "no." Now everything is  blurred, the majority of regional conflicts are notable for  their striking complexity, and the involvement therein of the  superpowers does not bode well. Which is why American  legislators are criticizing the administration without  counterposing their own positive programs.    The reasons for this modesty are clear. First, a positive  program has to be answered for -- and certainly before the  elections. Second, the Americans, like the Russians, are  becoming less and less interested in foreign policy, giving  preference to problems closer to home.</p>

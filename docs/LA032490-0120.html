			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THATCHER DETERMINED TO CARRY ON DESPITE BY-ELECTION SETBACK;  </P> <P> BRITAIN: LABOR'S WIN OF A 'SAFE' TORY SEAT MAY REFLECT A TIDE AGAINST HER. BUT  SHE REJECTS 'TRIMMING AND TURNING.'  </P> <P> A "disappointed" Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday that despite one  of her Conservative Party's most humiliating by-election defeats in more than  half a century, she will stick to the policies that have kept her in office for  nearly 11 years.  </P> <P> "We are not a 'fair-weather' party," the 64-year-old prime minister stated in a  letter to party Chairman Kenneth Baker. "We are not for trimming and turning."  </P> <P> The Conservatives were drubbed at the polls Thursday in a semi-rural  constituency north of Birmingham where they had enjoyed a large majority at the  last general election in 1987.  </P> <P> Final results announced early Friday showed the rival Labor Party candidate,  social worker Sylvia Heal, taking 49% of the vote, against 33% for her  Conservative competitor, publisher Charles Prior. The remaining votes were  shared among other candidates representing smaller parties.  </P> <P> Heal's 9,449-vote margin of victory marked a stunning turnaround. In 1987, John  Heddle won the seat for the Conservatives with a 14,654-vote cushion. Heddle's  suicide last December triggered Thursday's special election to fill his vacant  seat.  </P> <P> The vote was widely seen here as evidence of a powerful anti-Thatcher tide  among voters that seriously jeopardizes her chances of gaining a fourth term in  office at the next general election, which must be held before mid-1992.  </P> <P> Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said the voting had marked more of a turning  point for the Conservative Party than for his own.  </P> <P> "They are going to have to make up their minds how quickly they get rid of Mrs.  Thatcher," he said.  </P> <P> In her letter to Baker, the prime minister acknowledged that the voters of the  Mid-Staffordshire constituency had "taken their chance to send us a message"  about high mortgage interest rates and an unpopular new local taxing scheme.  "These matters are naturally of concern to us all," she said.  </P> <P> However, Thatcher insisted, "I know that by continuing the policies which have  served us so well, we will win back the support of the electors of  Mid-Staffordshire at the next general election."  </P> <P> A close Thatcher aide said the prime minister considered the Mid-Staffordshire  result to represent a protest rather than a sea-change in the national  political mood.  </P> <P> Ruling parties here traditionally suffer a slump in the middle of their terms  of office. They almost always recover somewhat before the next election,  although sometimes not enough to stay in office.  </P> <P> According to the latest British Broadcasting Corp. compilation of the four most  important polls here, Conservative support nationwide has fallen to 30% from  45% at the beginning of 1989. The party won the 1987 general election with  43.3% of the vote. Satisfaction with Thatcher's leadership stands at an  all-time low of 26%, the BBC said.  </P> <P> What most worries the Conservatives is that the erosion in support has come  mostly among those people who have been the primary benefactors of Thatcherism:  young homeowners and skilled workers. They are hit hard by one of Europe's  highest inflation rates and a government policy of keeping interest rates high  that has pushed mortgage payments up by several hundred dollars.  </P></p>

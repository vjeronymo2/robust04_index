Regulatory Impact Statement <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Executive Order 12866  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any document that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the proposed rule, we determined that a regulatory impact analysis was not required for these rules because they would not have an annual impact of $100 million or more or meet any of the other threshold criteria. However, we indicated our intention to include in the final rule a cost and benefit analysis that considers the social benefits to Medicare beneficiaries who use EPO at home. We asked for specific comments concerning benefits from home administration of EPO. We listed, as examples of these benefits, savings in travel and transportation costs previously required to obtain EPO or the ability of the beneficiary to resume employment. We also requested public comment on any benefits and costs that may be anticipated as a result of this regulation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No comments were received concerning the benefits of self-administration of EPO or on any portion of the impact analysis. Thus, we have prepared an analysis based on our review of data available to us and of pertinent literature. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The following chart summarizes home dialysis beneficiary records for the period February 28, 1991 through February 29, 1992. It reflects the most current data on file and also encompasses the time immediately before and after July 1, 1991, the effective data of coverage of home administration of EPO. We identified, as ESRD beneficiaries who are potentially eligible for home use of EPO, beneficiaries who have completed the necessary home dialysis training or were home dialysis patients during this period. The chart indicates the number of beneficiaries on home dialysis and the number receiving EPO therapy as of June 30, 1991. The same information is shown for the billing period November 1, 1991 through January 31, 1992, the most current billing information for home dialysis beneficiaries. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <TABLE>  <!-- PJG tableformat 5,L2,i1,s100,20,20,20,20 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=95 g=1 f=4 --> Home Dialysis Beneficiaries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=96 g=1 f=4 --> [February 28, 1991&hyph;February 29, 1992] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1&blank; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Home Dialysis Beneficiaries <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Self-Adm.* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Fac/Phy.** <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0150 intable --> 1Not Receiv'g EPO <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0152 intable -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=01 g=1 f=4 --> As of 6/30/91  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 38,515  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> &blank;  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 12,733  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 25,782 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Billing Period 11/1/91&hyph;1/31/92  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 38,515  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 1,656  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 11,890  <!-- PJG 007 0104 intable --> 24,969 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> *Self-Adm. stands for self-administered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 007 0146 intable --> **Fac/Phy. stands for facility or physician administered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </TABLE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Our records indicate that as of June 30, 1991 there were 38,515 beneficiaries that dialyzed at home. Before coverage of home administration of EPO, 12,733 of these beneficiaries received EPO in the ESRD facility or in a physician's office. As a result of coverage of home administration of EPO, 1,656 beneficiaries or 4.3 percent of home dialysis beneficiaries self-administer EPO. We estimate that this number will increase as more beneficiaries become qualified to self-administer EPO and realize the benefits of home administration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In attempting to perform a cost-benefit analysis, we reviewed three published reports and one unpublished report. We also relied upon billing information submitted by intermediaries. Average expenditure for ESRD beneficiaries receiving EPO therapy approximate $6,900 exclusive of dialysis treatment. This amount includes the cost of the drug and other services such as iron treatment and hypertension therapy. The average annual cost for patients not using EPO approximates $450, exclusive of dialysis treatments, and includes the cost of other services such as blood transfusions and hepatitis therapy. The annual expenditures for EPO users represent very gross estimates. More definitive cost data and experience with the administration of EPO is needed in order to permit analysis of actual costs and EPO's relative effects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As mentioned earlier in this preamble, use of EPO by chronic renal failure patients reduces or eliminates the need for blood transfusions. EPO also reduces the recipients' risk of transfusion-related illnesses. The transmission of non-A, non-B hepatitis is of greatest concern (see ``Recombinant Human Erythropoietin: Factors to Consider in Cost-Benefit Analysis'', American Journal of Kidney Diseases, Vol. XVII, No. 1, January 1991). Although rare, the threat of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis B should also be considered. For ESRD patients receiving EPO, the risk of hepatitis infection related to transfusions has been reduced from 13.8 to 4.5 percent because the patient's need for blood transfusions has been reduced and in some cases eliminated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reclaiming tax credits I HAVE BOUGHT BT3 shares for my son, who is six months old. To whom should I write and what is the procedure for claiming back tax credits attached to the dividends? Second, I have a brother who works and lives in Canada. He holds various UK shares, with his address registered in the UK (ie, my address). Can he claim back tax credits attached to dividends, and what is/are the procedures? Provided that your son's income (inclusive of tax credits) from gifts from your wife and yourself does not exceed Pounds 100 in 1993-94, you should ask your local tax office for a form on which you and your wife can claim payment of the tax credits on his behalf next April. If possible, tell the local tax office the names and reference numbers of the tax offices which deal with your own and your wife's returns. If your son's income derived (directly or indirectly) from funds provided by your wife and yourself exceeds Pounds 100 in 1993-94, no tax credits will be paid to you on his behalf; his dividends will be treated as your own (or your wife's, as the case may be) under section 663 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. On the second point, we take it your brother is a Commonwealth citizen. That being so, he is entitled to a full personal allowance against his UK income for 1990-91 onwards. If his UK dividends (inclusive of tax credits) exceed his personal allowance, he will be entitled to payment of a quarter of the 20 per cent tax credit on his dividends for the present tax year in excess of his personal allowance, by virtue of article 10(3) of the double taxation convention between Canada and the UK. For 1990-91 to 1992-93, the corresponding payment will be two-fifths of the 25 per cent tax credit; in each case, the effective residual rate of UK tax is 15 per cent, and this is eligible for credit against his Canadian tax liability by virtue of article 21(1)(a) of the convention. He should write for claim forms (one for each tax year) to the Inland Revenue, Claims Branch (International), St John's House, Merton Road, Bootle, Merseyside, L69 9BB, giving his nationality and details of any periods spent in the UK in the past six years. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SENATE PANEL TO PROBE IRAN-CONTRA PAPERS  </P> <P> The Senate Intelligence Committee has decided to launch a formal investigation  of the apparent White House failure to provide key documents to the  congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra scandal, its chairman  said Wednesday.  </P> <P> Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), who heads the intelligence panel, said that he  ordered the inquiry in response to requests from several senators who said that  they had not been given six significant documents that surfaced as evidence in  the trial of former White House aide Oliver L. North.  </P> <P> The six documents center on a secret Ronald Reagan Administration effort to  persuade Honduras to aid the Nicaraguan rebels, including the acceleration of  U.S. economic aid to Honduras. Several of the documents also include evidence  that President Bush, as vice president, was more involved in the secret Contra  aid operation than he has admitted.  </P> <P> "We will look at this matter expeditiously and in a businesslike, nonpolitical  manner," Boren said in a statement released by his office. "I am determined  that this matter will not be blown out of proportion or made into a political  football."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, jurors at the North trial deliberated for a fifth day without  reaching a verdict. They met for six hours before quitting for the day at 4:25  p.m., bringing their deliberations to 27 hours over five days.  </P> <P> Theories of why the trial documents were not released to the congressional  committees range from a deliberate cover-up to simple incompetence,  congressional investigators said.  </P> <P> Some former aides to the Iran-Contra committees said that they have long  suspected that the White House deliberately withheld some information. White  House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, who served in the Reagan Administration at  the time of the 1987 congressional inquiry, has denied that charge.  </P> <P> </P> <P> White House Letter  </P> <P> Late Wednesday evening, the White House released copies of a letter from White  House counsel C. Boyden Gray to Mitchell pledging to "endeavor to be as helpful  as we can" in resolving questions about the documents.  </P> <P> But Gray took considerable pains to distance Bush from the controversy. "As you  know," he wrote, "this Administration was not a party to (the) agreements to  assist the committees and their work."  </P> <P> "We have confidence that the last Administration followed the agreed  procedures, and that its representatives will be able to address your  concerns," Gray wrote, noting that Reagan's counsel, Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr.,  "had overall responsibility" for ensuring congressional investigators received  what they needed.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Could Pick Documents  </P> <P> The congressional committees allowed the White House to determine which  documents were relevant to their investigation.  </P> <P> Other former committee aides have said that the problem may have been more  innocent. "I went down to the White House to see how they were compiling these  documents, and I've never seen a more chaotic operation in my life," one said.  </P> <P> Boren's decision to launch a formal investigation followed a request from  Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.); Sen. Daniel K. Inouye  (D-Hawaii), the chairman of the Senate Iran-Contra panel, and Sen. Warren B.  Rudman (R-N.H.), the panel's vice chairman.  </P> <P> Mitchell, Inouye and Rudman complained that the congressional committees  apparently did not receive copies of four significant documents released during  the North trial. In the case of two other documents, they said, the committees  received copies that were not as complete as the versions released in the North  trial.  </P> <P> The four documents that the committees did not receive:  </P> <P>  -- A Feb. 19, 1985, memorandum from National Security Adviser Robert C.  McFarlane to President Reagan, recommending accelerated economic and military  aid to Honduras as "incentives for them to persist in aiding the freedom  fighters." The memo shows that Reagan approved the recommendation and that a  copy was sent to Bush.  </P> <P>  -- A Feb. 20, 1985, memorandum from North and NSC aide Raymond F. Burghardt to  McFarlane, noting -- among other things -- that the Honduran aid deal violated  the spirit of the law. "Notwithstanding our own interpretations, it is very  clear . . . that the legislative intent was to deny any direct or indirect  support for military/paramilitary operations in Nicaragua," the memorandum  says.  </P> <P>  -- A Feb. 22, 1985, memorandum from Burghardt to McFarlane, asking for  authorization to hand-carry a letter from Reagan to the president of Honduras.  </P> <P>  -- An Oct. 30, 1985, memorandum from North to McFarlane, indicating that  Reagan may have approved a scheme to airdrop recoilless rifles to the Contras  for an attack on weapons shipments into Nicaragua's Caribbean ports.  </P> <P> The two documents that the committee received in less complete versions:  </P> <P>  -- A Feb. 11, 1985, NSC memorandum on the Honduran deal. The version released  during the trial includes an additional memorandum describing the aid that the  United States would provide "as an incentive to the Hondurans for their  continued support to (the Contras). Obviously this part of the message should  not be contained in a written document, but rather delivered verbally by a  discreet emissary." The author of the memorandum presumably meant "orally"  rather than "verbally."  </P> <P>  -- An April 25, 1985, memorandum on President Reagan's telephone call to  then-Honduran President Roberto Suazo Cordova. The version released during the  trial includes Reagan's handwritten notes on the conversation, in which he  urged Suazo to help the Contras and Suazo asked for more economic aid; it also  includes a notation indicating a copy went to Bush.  </P> <P> Staff writer Robert L.

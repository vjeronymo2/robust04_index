			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Copyright Code defines the local service area of a broadcast station as the area in which the station would be entitled to insist upon its signal being retransmitted by a cable system in accordance with ``the rules, regulations, and authorizations of the Federal Communications Commission in effect on April 15, 1976''_ <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the 1976 must-carry rules. 17 U.S.C. 111(f). There is no question that in creating the cable compulsory license, Congress chose to freeze the 1976 must-carry rules for purposes of calculating cable copyright royalties. H.R. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 99 (1976). The purpose of freezing the must-carry rules was to insure that any subsequent rule amendments by the FCC that either increase or decrease the size of the local service area for its purposes do not change the definition for copyright purposes. The Committee believes that any such change for copyright purposes, which would materially affect the royalty fee payments provided in the legislation, should only be made by an amendment to the statute. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 --> Id.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Because Congress froze the 1976 must-carry rules for copyright purposes in determining local signals, we must resolve whether Congress also intended to freeze the major television market list as it was in 1976. We are persuaded by the legislative history of the Copyright Code, and the supporting views of the majority of commentators to this proceeding, that Congress did not intend to freeze &sect;76.51, and that FCC redesignations of markets on the list are not substantive changes to the 1976 must-carry rules. In describing the must-carry area for the definition of the local service area of a broadcast signal, the 1976 House Committee Report specifically listed the FCC rules that contained must-carry provisions: ``Under FCC rules and regulations this so-called must-carry area is defined based on the market size and position of cable systems in 47 C.F.R. &sect;&sect;76.57, 76.59, 76.61 and 76.63.'' Id. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Omission of &sect;76.51 is not surprising since &sect;76.51 is not a must-carry rule; &sect;76.51 is only incorporated by reference to must-carry determinations. We therefore reaffirm the conclusions announced in our 1987 Policy Decision: (1) Congress did not intend &sect;76.51 to be frozen to its April 15, 1976 status for purposes of determining cable systems' local service area and copyright royalty fees; and (2) when the FCC amends its major television market list in 47 CFR 76.51, there has been no substantive rule change effected so as to impact calculations of cable copyright royalties. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 52 FR 28365 (July 29, 1987).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

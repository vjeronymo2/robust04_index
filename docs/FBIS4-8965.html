			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, prime ministerial candidate of </F> the Alliance of Free Democrats, by Zoltan Fekete; place and date  not given: "The SZDSZ Is Not Planning a Political Cleanup"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Fekete] When you were  elected list leader, that is, prime ministerial candidate, by  your party, many people thought that history was repeating  itself in the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ]. This means  that, after the so-called inner city "hard core" had placed  [former Chairman] Peter Tolgyessy in the center, it again wants  to put a presentable, and even likable, person in the center who  can be accepted by the country's public. Are you not afraid  that you will also be pushed in the background like your party  chairman predecessor was if you do not obey the "hard core"?    [Kuncze] On the one hand, I do not believe in the existence  of anything like an inner-city "hard core" and, on the other  hand, if Tolgyessy was here, he would probably object strongly  to having been placed into his position by a non-existent "hard  core." Tolgyessy was elected party chairman by a large majority  of the national meeting of delegates, while I was elected list  leader and prime ministerial candidate on the basis of the  recommendation of the executive body of the SZDSZ's National  Council. I believe that my candidacy has the support of the  whole SZDSZ membership.    [Fekete] By rejecting the existence of the "hard core," you  obviously do not wish to deny the existence of a sharp contrast  between the line represented by [SZDSZ Chairman] Ivan Peto,  Miklos Haraszti, and Balint Magyar, and the Tolgyessy wing?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ does have various trends and platforms  but, to the best of my knowledge, Tolgyessy has not joined any  of these. However, these platforms and views are not determined  according to the dwelling places of the members, and the  contrast between them is not as sharp as you suggest. The  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is not divided according to  where its members live, either.... [passage omitted]    [Fekete] How can you now describe cooperation between the  parties of the Liberal Bloc? I mainly ask this because a  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] deputy recently said that  overtaking the SZDSZ, and to come out of the election campaign  as the biggest Hungarian liberal party are the most important  goals for the Fidesz.    [Kuncze] I can confidently say that cooperation between the  liberal parties is running smoothly, we have completed the  coordination of our election programs and, although we have  differences, these are not unbridgeable. As for the statements  of the Fidesz politician, I certainly agree with him because we  are running in the elections separately and we are rivals as  well as allies. This is perfectly natural, just as the fact  that differences exist between the two parties. I trust that  liberals will be governing in Hungary after the 1994 elections.  [passage omitted]    [Fekete] [passage omitted] The SZDSZ has an advertisement  that states that you would reduce government expenditure after  you come to power. It is very attractive that you take the  money out of your pocket in advance. What will happen to the  tax burden of the citizens?    [Kuncze] We are serious about our intention to reduce the  government's expenditure because otherwise it is impossible to  convince the citizens that the government is handling their tax  forints responsibly, that it does not spend the money lightly  while it is earned by the taxpayers with hard work. On the  other hand, the SZDSZ's economic experts believe that a  significant reduction of expenditure is indeed necessary to end  the current terrible state of the economy. The SZDSZ's plans  include tax reductions both in the economic organizations and  the private sphere. [passage omitted]    [Fekete] In your view, will we need a government of experts?    [Kuncze] The next government will also be formed by  politicians and the political positions will be occupied by  politicians. At the same time, we need politicians who are  familiar with the area they are to manage and control. In this  sense, we need experts, but I emphasize that this does not mean  that the ministerial positions will be occupied by experts who  are independent of parties.    [Fekete] [Hungarian Socialist Party Chairman] Gyula Horn  recently promised that some dismissed radio workers will be  placed back into their positions, although he did not actually  promise a clean-up. Is it possible that the SZDSZ will also  launch these kinds of measures, or are you more in favor of  legal solutions?    [Kuncze] I would like to see an end to fear in this country  once and for all, and for this very reason I am not going to  react to any threats, and I do not even like to listen to them.  Under an SZDSZ government, no one needs to be afraid of any  kind of political clean-up. It is a different matter that we  need good professionals in the various positions of state  administration; if someone is well-prepared and suitable for his  job then we will not look at his party affiliation or who placed  him into his job. However, if the person is unsuitable for his  tasks then he must go, again, regardless of his party  affiliation. Therefore, people who are good at what they are  doing have nothing to be afraid of.    [Fekete] Three weeks before the elections, how many parties  have a chance to get into Parliament?    [Kuncze] As far as I can judge, the same six parliamentary  parties that the electors gave legislative tasks in 1990 have a  chance to get into Parliament. I am now talking about reaching  the 5-percent limit; it is quite possible that some  representatives of other parties will also be elected to  Parliament. [passage omitted]    [Fekete] How many parliamentary mandates do you think the  SZDSZ will get in May?    [Kuncze] We have the chance to repeat our 1990 performance  and gain 90 to 100 parliamentary seats. If we succeed in this  then it will be certain that the liberal parties together will  be unavoidable factors in the next governmental cycle.</p>

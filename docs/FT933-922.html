			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Hope for fresh start in Japan-US relations: Hosokawa's trip MR Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's new prime minister, is to meet US President Bill Clinton today for what officials hope will be a fresh start to strained US-Japan relations. The meeting, their first since Mr Hosokawa became prime minister seven weeks ago, will allow them to review relations following the end of 38 years of rule by the Liberal Democratic party. Mr Hosokawa will also address the United Nations General Assembly today, and he is expected to apologise for Japan's actions in the second world war, the first time he will have done so in a foreign setting. The move is part of the new government's efforts to plot out a larger Japanese role in international affairs. But at the same time, Mr Hosokawa is expected to be non-committal on Japanese approaches for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, because of opposition from the pacifist Social Democratic party, the largest in the seven-party coalition. Both sides' main objective for Mr Hosokawa's hour-long meeting with Mr Clinton is to build personal confidence and discuss broad issues, rather than detail. Mr Hosokawa will explain his political and economic reform policies and discuss foreign policy co-operation on Russia, the Middle East, China and North Korea. He also hopes to discuss plans to reform the UN, though officials accept that it is unlikely that they will get through the whole agenda in such a brief encounter. Japanese officials believe strains with the US have been eased by the steps Tokyo has taken in the past few weeks to try to revive the economy, partly in response to pressure from Washington. These include plans to cut administrative red tape, a Y6,150bn (Pounds 37.7bn) public spending package and a  3/4 -point cut in the Bank of Japan's official discount rate to a new low of 1.75 per cent. US officials are disappointed that the new government has not cut income tax, but this is politically difficult for Mr Hosokawa. Meanwhile, two-week-old talks on mapping out the 'framework agreement' reached at the Tokyo economic summit last July have yet to make significant progress on ways for Japan to reduce its surplus by opening markets to foreign competition. Mr Hosokawa claimed on Friday that Tokyo and Washington had agreed there would be no attempt to set a numerically targeted cut in Japan's record current account surplus, a big irritant to relations. The surplus hit Dollars 117.55bn (Pounds 76.3bn), or 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product, last year, a factor in the yen's rise of nearly 20 per cent against the dollar since January. 'Concerning the surplus, Japan and the US have agreed not to set numerical targets,' Mr Hosokawa told the upper house of parliament. 'It is not appropriate for the government to set specific targets because the surplus cannot be adjusted freely by just structural changes in one country.' Foreign Ministry officials, however, pointed out that this was in line with the original agreement at the Tokyo summit. The issue has given rise to numerous misunderstandings on both sides, but US officials in Tokyo had no comment. Tokyo's policy on this was plunged into confusion last week when Mr Tsutomu Hata, the foreign minister, suggested Japan should soften its opposition to targets. This was welcomed by Japanese business groups, which believe the dispute with the US on the current account surplus has contributed to the yen's rise. Mr Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japanese association of corporate executives, yesterday became the latest business leader to suggest that Japan should try to reduce the current account surplus to 2 per cent of GDP in the medium term. However, as Mr Hosokawa reminded parliament, the government is officially sticking to its opposition to precise targets.</p>

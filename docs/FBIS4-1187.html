			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by E. van Wyk] </F>   [Text] Pretoria April 25 SAPA -- A breakthrough was  expected shortly in investigations into the central Johannesburg  and Germiston bomb blasts, SA [South African] Police [SAP]  Commissioner Johan van der Merwe said on Monday [25 April].    Police had increased to R1 million [rand] the reward for  information leading to the arrest and conviction of those  responsible for the blasts, which left at least 17 people dead,  Gen van der Merwe said in a statement.    The SAP was sparing no effort in hunting down those  responsible for the mindless acts of terrorism and all available  resources, including the best detectives, would be deployed, the  general said.    "I call on all South Africans to unite and assist the SAP in  fighting this civil threat to public safety and democracy in our  country."    He called for calm and understanding from the public and  said  the SAP would immediately institute wide-ranging measures to  prevent similar atrocities. Areas would be cordoned off and  snap searches conducted. The SAP remained committed to  combating terrorism "tooth and nail and will not fail in its  duty to protect the birth of democracy in South Africa. I am  able to say that investigations into these outrages have reached  the stage where it is hoped that a breakthrough will take place  shortly."</p>

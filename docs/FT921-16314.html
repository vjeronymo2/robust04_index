			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Directors' Transactions EVEREST Foods had poor results in 1990, at which point three directors bought shares at prices of between 72.5p and 80p. Following the company's recent offer, two directors have each sold 300,000 shares at 168p, although two other directors have increased their holdings. Substantial buying has been seen in Tarmac, with Sir Anthony Bamford buying a further 200,000 shares at 99p. The price has fallen by almost two-thirds this year with this recent purchase following one in October at 160p. Sir Anthony was joined by a fellow non-executive director who purchased 100,000 shares. Richard Peskin, of Great Portland, the property company, has continued to increase his holding, purchasing shares at 152p. This purchase follows the acquisition of 500,000 shares earlier this month at about the same price. Nigel Rudd, chairman of Williams Holdings, has taken the opportunity to top up his holding following the failed offer for Racal Electronics.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Directors' share transactions in their own companies (listed &amp; USM)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 No of Company                     Shares     Value    directors  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- EMAP                          7,343       17    1 Everest Foods               600,000    1,008    2 Jupiter Tyndall              22,500       28    1 Kingfisher                  600,000    2,700    1 Sims Foods                  115,219      362    2 Ultramar                    124,688      320    3* Warburg SG (Cn Dfd)          10,000       25    1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital Gearing               3,600       10    1 Chloride Group              170,000       10    2 Everest Foods                16,686       28    2 Fisher (Albert)              30,000       20    1 Gt Portland Estates         115,000      175    1 Lasmo                         4,505       10    1 Mowlem (John)                11,970       14    3 Plaxton                      25,000       10    1 Tarmac                      300,000      299    2 Williams Holdings            50,000      145    1  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Value expressed in Pounds 000s.

Changes to this document were made in 1993 and published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> , October 6, 1993, Vol. 58, No. 192, page 52078. The changes published herein reflect soils added and deleted since the 1991 publication. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The national list of hydric soils changes as additional soil series are recognized and defined and/or properties of existing soil series are updated based on additional data. These changes reflect refinements in knowledge of the soils of the United States. New soil series are recognized as soils are mapped in previously unmapped areas. These new series have always met hydric soil criteria, whether recognized as series or not, and thus represent an insignificant change in acreage of hydric soils. Soils that are removed from the list are mostly dry phases of existing hydric soils. These dry phases would not have met wetland hydrology criteria, thus represent an insignificant change in acreage of wetlands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The list of hydric soils is computer generated using the hydric soil criteria and a database of properties of each soil series in the United States. The database is also used to generate interpretations of how soils perform for many land uses. Therefore, some changes in the list of hydric soils result from adding phases for a hydric soil to refine another interpretation. This split or addition of a hydric phase causes an increase in the number of hydric soils, but does not affect the acres of the hydric soil. Data for all soil series are in the Soil Interpretations Record and may be reviewed by contacting a local office of the Soil Conservation Service in the appropriate State. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The National Technical Committee also modified the definition of hydric soils as given in Miscellaneous Publication 1491 to ``A hydric soil is a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part.'' The change in the definition does not affect the National List of Hydric Soils. The change aligns the definition more closely with  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Soil Taxonomy <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and clarifies that artificially drained phases are hydric soils if the soil in its undisturbed state meets the criteria. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 29, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 -->  Richard W.

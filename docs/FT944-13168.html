			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / International Company News: Munich Re lifts payout to DM12 Munich Reinsurance, the world's largest reinsurance company, is increasing its dividend and strengthening reserves after a rise in profits which benefited from a sharp cut in underwriting losses. The payment to shareholders for the year to June 30 1994 will rise DM1 to DM12 a share, with the parent company's net profit up by 23 per cent to DM91m (Dollars 61m). Full group figures will be given early next month. In 1992-93, group net profits rose 3 per cent to DM287m, with group premium income 11 per cent higher at DM26bn. Last year's underwriting loss was DM315m, about a third of the previous year's figure. Munich Re, which owns 25 per cent of Allianz, Germany's and Europe's largest insurance concern - which in turn owns 25 per cent of Munich Re - also said it had added a further DM523m to its provisions for claims equalisation and for big risks, after DM33m in 1992-93. In spite of lower profits on its investments, it has also put another DM350m into its reserves for claims still outstanding, compared with DM450m last year. A further DM50 will go into its revenue reserves.</p>

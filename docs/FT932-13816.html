			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Fiat md appears before magistrates Mr Cesare Romiti, managing director of Italy's Fiat industrial group, yesterday appeared before magistrates investigating political corruption, writes Haig Simonian in Milan. The move represents a considerable climbdown by Fiat, which has been heavily implicated in allegations of kickbacks to politicians on public sector contracts. Until now the company has been reluctant to co-operate, resulting in the lengthy incarceration of numerous managers. However, Fiat's approach has recently changed as the arrests have moved up its corporate ladder. Just before Easter, magistrates issued a cautionary warrant against Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, Fiat's chief operating officer and the most senior executive so far involved. In spite of strict security, yesterday's meeting, in Milan's main police station, attracted considerable attention.</p>

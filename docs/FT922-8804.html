			<p>920512 FT  12 MAY 92 / Survey of Angola (6): Formidable obstacles - Foreign Investment ARGUABLY no country in Africa has been blessed with greater resources than Angola: oil and diamonds, plentiful fertile farmland with rivers that flow all year, huge marine resources, natural harbours, and an area five times the size of Britain but with only 10m people. The ruling MPLA party and Unita, their main rivals in the September elections, agree that foreign investment is essential if this cornucopia is to be developed. But the would-be investor faces some formidable obstacles, ranging from complex legislation to corruption, a slow-moving bureaucracy and all the problems associated with a country desperately short of skilled personnel and an infrastructure ruined by war. While acknowledging that much may have to be done, government officials point out that the 1988 investment law guaranteed remittance of net profits, contained provision for tax holidays, exemption from or reduction of customs duties on imports of capital goods and spare parts, and a guarantee of fair compensation in the event of expropriation - reinforced by Angola's decision to sign the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agreement (Miga). Funding from development agencies, led by the World Bank, should be available to reinforce the private sector role in priority investment areas, say officials. These include agriculture, food processing, mining, fishing and fish processing and construction. Advice is available from the Foreign Investment Office* whose role is to answer queries from abroad, evaluate proposals and act as co-ordinators. Would-be investors planning to make commitments before the September poll may need to tread carefully, however. Unita failed to secure the government's agreement to a proposal to establish a joint body to oversee foreign investment policy and decisions during the pre-election period. The result, claim party officials, is a number of questionable deals by government officials taking advantage of what may be their last opportunity to secure kickbacks or commissions. The trenchant tone of Unita's criticism of the foreign partners involved has concerned some businessmen and diplomats. They acknowledge that Unita has grounds for concern but suspect there is within the party a strong streak of economic nationalism, whose advocates are ideologically opposed to substantial foreign business involvement in the economy. Unita officials deny this and reaffirm the party's commitment to its investment code, published in July last year. Declaring its support for a 'private enterprise-based market economy', the party document 'recognises the critical role of foreign investment in providing access to foreign capital, technology, management skills and foreign markets.' A Unita government will 'actively encourage' investment in commercial agriculture and agro-business, fishing, mining, oil and petrochemicals, energy, and manufacturing, says the code, which also offers guarantees on remittances of profits, dividends and royalties. * Gabinete do Investimento Estrangeiro (Foreign Investment Office) Rua Cerqueira Lukoki No 25 Tel: 392620 Tx 3262 Fax 393381</p>

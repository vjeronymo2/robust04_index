			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 25 (XINHUA)--Building materials have  become the third biggest industry of Beijing, after the  automotive and electronics industries.    Officials of the Beijing Urban and Rural Construction  Committee said that the industry had a turnover of 7.5 billion  yuan and exports worth 31.33 million U.S. dollars in 1993.    A large part of the value was created in modern building  materials, such as cement, new wall material, sound-proof, fire-  proof and water-proof materials, porcelain ware, decoration  materials and hardware, rather than in bricks, sand and other  traditional products, the officials said.    According to the officials, energy-saving and other  high-tech  new building materials will be the direction for future  development.</p>

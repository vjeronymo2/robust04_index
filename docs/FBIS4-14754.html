			<p>BFN     [Text] Deputy Chairman of the State Duma Aleksandr  Vengerovskiy, one of the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party  of Russia, declared to INTERFAX that the resolution of the  Congress on a substantial expansion of the LDPR Chairman  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy's authorities would assist in  consolidation of the party.    "We have just conducted cleansing of the party from  temporary  people who entered the party to satisfy their private  ambitions," he noted.    Vengerovskiy called assertions stating that the LDPR turns  into the party of one man as groundless. In his opinion, it is  necessary to strengthen the role of the party's chairman  "because the party is on the way to power." To this effect the  authorities granted to Zhirinovskiy are not excessive ones  because under the present situation in Russia they are necessary  for the party's survival, said Vengerovskiy.    Vengerovskiy who has just returned from a trip throughout  the  former Yugoslavia declared that the present policy of the  Russian Foreign Ministry does not meet interests of the country.  "We commit a betrayal with respect to the fraternal Serbian  people who are experiencing different forms of genocide," said  he.    In his opinion, western special services and those who would  like to make the Balkans the zone of their century long  influence are waging the war on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia. He said that "the most terrible fact is that Russia  supports the sanctions against the Serbs." Vengerovskiy  believes that Moscow should strictly occupy the positions of the  Serbs and recognize the republic of Serb Krajina.    Vengerovsky qualifies Russia's joining NATO's Partnership  for  Peace program as "a national betrayal of the country."</p>

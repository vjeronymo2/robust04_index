She made this statement after Thursday's talks between the  Russian Foreign Minister, Andrey Kozyrev, and his Armenian  counterpart, Vahan Papazyan. The same day Kozyrev conferred  with the Foreign Minister of the self-proclaimed Republic of  Nagorno-Karabakh, Arkady Gukasyan.    According to Sidorova, the main goal pursued by Moscow is to  sign an agreement on a cease-fire and halting military actions  in Nagorno-Karabakh. "Russia fears that the conflict may further  destabilize the situation in the region," she pointed out.    "The negotiations are progressing with difficulty," Sidorova  said. "Each of the warring sides has its own claims. It's a  long conflict, and each side is apprehensive about taking some  wrong step," she stressed.    In the meantime, as the chief of the Russian Foreign  Ministry's Press and Information Department, Grigoriy Karasin,  said at Thursday's briefing in Moscow, the results of the talks  held by Kozyrev with Papazyan and Gukasyan, as well as with the  head of Azeri diplomacy, Gasan Gasanov, two days ago "show that  the warring sides' attitudes to the possibility of signing an  agreement on ceasing hostilities altogether have somewhat  softened."</p>

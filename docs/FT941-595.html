			<p>940329 FT  29 MAR 94 / International Company News: Sony wields axe in management reshape Sony, the Japanese consumer electronics company, yesterday announced a reorganisation plan aimed at improving corporate decision-making by reducing management layers. The company will cut the number of divisions and departments to 450 from 580, and reorganise its manufacturing and marketing groups into eight separate internal 'companies' or sections. The eight internal 'companies' are: consumer audio-visuals; components; recording media and energy; broadcast products; business and industrial systems; telecommunications; mobile electronics; and semiconductors. The section heads will be given more power, overseeing design, manufacturing and marketing. Matsushita Electric Industrial, the country's largest consumer electronics maker, announced similar a plan last December. This includes a cut in administrative personnel to 70 per cent of the previous number by shifting surplus administrative employees to marketing positions. Aside from restructuring plans centred on cost-cutting programmes announced in the past year, Japan's large electronics makers, hit by the recession and the strong yen, are struggling to revitalise their operations by changes in organisation, cutting the number of sections and section heads.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Yelena Shchedrunova report under the "Balkans" rubric: "A </F> New Russian Success in the Former Yugoslavia. Cease-fire  Agreement Signed Between Croatia and Serbian Krajina"]    [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] Vitaliy Churkin, Russia's  special representative in the talks on the former Yugoslavia,  who returned to Moscow on the evening of 30 March, has told your  SEGODNYA correspondent that the document signed gives all  reasons to state that the threat of a military conflict between  the Serbs and the Croats has been brought to nil. [passage  omitted]    The next step in the efforts to settle the conflict between  Croatia and Serbian Krajina will be talks on the resumption of  economic ties and communications between regions that are  scheduled to be held in two weeks or so, probably at the same  location. Discussion of the most crucial matter -- Serbian  Krajina's status -- was postponed indefinitely. Vitaliy Churkin  believes that the process of decisionmaking on the subject  should not be rushed; he pointed out, however, that both Russia  and the West adhere to the principle of Croatia's territorial  integrity. But he is "certain that solutions are possible that  would not be detrimental to either side." [passage omitted]    Vitaliy Churkin emphasized that the United States, the EC,  and the participants in the international conference have had a  significant role to play in achieving this result. Although the  meeting was sponsored and organized by Russia, which later  invited other participants to join it, only the thorough  coordination in the actions of all mediators made it possible to  make sure that the agreement was signed. Vitaliy Churkin  pointed out in particular that U.S. and Russian diplomats, who  had previously made repeated statements about the coincidence of  their views on the Balkan conflict, demonstrated this  coincidence in practice for the first time. The experience of  the Zagreb talks, he stressed, may also be used for Bosnia and  Herzegovina.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated above, consideration of the national costs and benefits of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of candidate standard levels was one of the factors considered in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking. (See Technical Support Document, Chapter 8.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> External Costs and Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A number of comments on the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking urged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Department to consider the external costs and benefits in its economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses of the efficiency standards proposed in this Notice of Proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rulemaking. For example, the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggested that DOE account explicitly for environmental costs in its economic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis. (American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, No. 6 at 6.) In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, Public Citizen stated that the Department should include in its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analyses all external costs and benefits, e.g., environmental quality,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national security, and reduced energy imports. (Public Citizen, No. 7 at 4.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Sierra Club stated that the difference between ``Consumer Analysis''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and ``Life-Cycle Cost Analysis'' is difficult to ascertain. They urged DOE to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate, as part of the Consumer Analysis; (a) environmental external costs;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, (b) national security and balance-of-payments costs of increased/decreased  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oil consumption. (Sierra Club, No. 43 at 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council said that the consumer and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> utility analyses should include monetization of externalities (environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and security) such as sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxides, particulate, and other air, water, and land use impacts of energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production and use. Such considerations should be consistent with current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> trends in state utility regulations. (Ohio Office of the Consumers' Council,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 60 at 2.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that appliance standards may generate external  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> societal benefits arising from reductions in oil imports, and emissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , NO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> x <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and CO <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and perhaps other pollutants. In this proposed rulemaking,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as in previous rulemakings, the Department derives the quantities of oil  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> savings and emissions reductions associated with the estimated energy demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reductions expected to result from the proposed standards, but does not attach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any externality values to these benefits. In a separate Advance Notice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed Rulemaking for three products (58 FR 47326, September 8, 1993), the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department has indicated that it would be desirable to establish monetary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> values for these external benefits, if sound analytical bases can be found for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doing so. The Department will attempt to develop and use such monetary values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the analysis of the likely impacts of updated standards for these three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product categories. However, because there is no consensus on how to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> undertake the analysis underlying estimates of such environmental and energy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security externalities, the Department is not yet able to set monetary values  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for such externalities accurately enough to be useful in the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Regional standards.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On another standards determination issue, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers stated opposition to the setting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of regional standards for room air conditioners. (Association of Home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appliance Manufacturers, No. 61A at 22.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department is not setting regional standards, but did conduct a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sensitivity analysis on life-cycle cost for room air conditioners because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their energy use is affected by climate. The sensitivity analysis considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional energy prices and usage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Corporate average fuel economy.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Rocky Mountain Institute stated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for appliances, like the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporate Average Fuel Economy for automobiles, could allow for the gradual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> phase-in of technologies that are substantially different from the present,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less-efficient technologies, e.g., horizontal-axis clothes washers and heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pump water heaters. (Rocky Mountain Institute, No. 15 at 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department acknowledges that some stringent standard levels could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involve radical industry manufacturing changes and recognizes that a Corporate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Average Fuel Economy-type approach to such standards could help to ease  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry's transition to producing these more efficient appliances. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes, however, that the Act precludes that option since the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statute requires any covered product to meet the energy conservation standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

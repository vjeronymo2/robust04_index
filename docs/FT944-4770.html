			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Row brews between BBC and ITC Tension is growing between the BBC and the Independent Television Commission over the future direction of the corporation's commercial policy. On Monday night Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general of the BBC, surprised a Royal Television Society dinner by attacking the ITC for its evidence to the government on the white paper to renew the corporation's royal charter. The attack came in part of the speech not released in advance by the BBC. Minutes after Sir George Russell, chairman of the ITC, had been made a fellow of the RTS, Mr Phillis criticised the ITC for submitting 'the least supportive response' to the government. In its evidence to the government, which was published last month, the ITC suggested that the BBC 'as a publicly funded broadcaster is not in a position to balance successfully the mixed cultures of public service broadcasting and commercial business enterprise'. The BBC has been encouraged by ministers to develop its commercial activities worldwide. Next month, in a joint venture with Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, the corporation will launch two 24-hour satellite channels aimed at Europe, one for news and one for entertainment. The ITC said that the company exploiting the relevant BBC assets and rights should not be owned by the corporation. Instead the assets should be franchised for a period to a wholly commercial group by competitive tender. The ITC called for the creation of an audit committee of BBC governors to review the franchising arrangements, and the privatisation of BBC transmitters to provide competition for National Transcomm, which transmits the commercial broadcasting channels. Mr Phillis said he had to question whether a regulator 'ought, in effect, to argue the case for those whom it actually regulates'. He also said: A possible move into digital terrestrial television would be damaged severely by the privatisation of BBC transmitters. He saw no logic in the franchising suggestion and asked why assets created by licence payers' money and the skills of BBC staff should be used to generate profit for shareholders in a franchise vehicle. Promised licence fee funding would not be put at risk and added that controls put in place meant that what the ITC described as 'dilemmas of cost allocation' would not arise.</p>

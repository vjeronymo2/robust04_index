Soskovets, Full Member of Russia's </F> Engineering Academy]    [Text] The history of Russian light alloy metallurgy which  served as the basis for subsequent formation of the aerospace  technology in the former USSR dates back to the commissioning of  the first specialized aluminum rolled stock mill 60 years ago.    The birth and constant dynamic development of aviation  engineering in the 1930s were inextricably linked to  improvements in the equipment and practices of casting ingots,  manufacturing various types of metallurgical semifinished  products, developing alloys, and expanding their applications in  the aircraft industry.    Aviation metallurgy achieved tremendous success during the  Great Patriotic War when an industrial base was created in the  shortest time in the eastern part of the country, complex  methods of manufacturing high-quality metal products were  implemented at new plants, and scientific research work aimed at  increasing aircraft ``survivability'' and improving their flight  performance was carried out.    The use of light alloys in space technology, shipbuilding,  and other areas of new technologies on a wider scale began in  the postwar years. As a result, aviation metallurgy is becoming  specialty metallurgy of light alloys and  organizationally--subordinated to the USSR Ministry of Aviation  Industry as a metallurgical department; at present, it is a part  of the Russian Federation Committee on Metallurgy.    The following landmarks characterize the postwar development  of specialty metallurgy:     -  mastering continuous casting of aluminum alloy ingots and  subsequently improving it by introducing vacuum melt treatment  using electromagnetic molds, group casting, etc.;    -  developing and bringing on stream high-output vertical  hydraulic presses with an up to 750 MN force for producing  large-size stampings as well as horizontal presses with an up to  200 MN force and mastering on their basis production of large  extruded sections and panels    -  developing and mastering multistand hot and cold rolling  mills  which ensure production of a broad assortment of slabs, sheets,  and bands for aircraft manufacturing and for other engineering  fields;    -  mastering and implementing titanium, high-temperature, and  refractory alloys and new melting methods (vacuum arc, electron  beam, and electroslag remelting) which make it possible to  produce alloys with a higher doping level in order to increase  the strength, heat resistance, and other properties of materials;    -  producing high-temperature nickel, titanium, and aluminum  alloys by the granular metallurgy method based on utilizing  rapid solidification and hot isostatic pressing and production  of billets by the methods of powder metallurgy, isothermal  stamping, diffusion welding, etc.    -  Specialty metallurgy made a significant contribution to  solving  complex problems related to the development of modern aviation  equipment at a high scientific and engineering level: these are  the Buran spacecraft, the Mriya AN-225 aircraft with the highest  load lifting capacity in the world, the comfortable civilian  aircraft IL-96-300, TU-204, and IL-114, the newest military  aircraft MIG-31, MIG-29, and SU-27, the Ka-32 and Mi-26  helicopters, highly efficient PS-90 and TV7-117 engines, support  aircraft, and other flying vehicles which are equal to the best  developments in the world.       Today, specialty and light alloy metallurgy in industrially  developed countries occupies one of the leading spots in various  types of rolled stock production. The assortment of semifinished  products produced has been expanded considerably, production of  especially large deformed products has been mastered, and the  quality indicators have been improved substantially.  Semifinished products from nickel-based alloys, refractory  metals, and aluminum-lithium alloys have been mastered and  implemented extensively.    A stable ratio has developed--40% of light alloy  blanks are  used in aviation and specialty technologies and 60%--in  the  national economy. This subindustry production largely determines  the possibilities of engineering progress in the production of  computer equipment, electronics, radio engineering, nuclear  power, construction, production of containers and packaging, and  other branches of the national economy.    In Russia, virtually all structural rolled stock from  aluminum, titanium, and a number of specialty alloys is produced  at eight specialty metallurgy plants: the SMK, SaMZ, KUMPO,  BKMPO, VSMPO, KMPP, KraMZ, and VILS.    Specialty metallurgy is characterized in that it represents  a  through technological production cycle--from smelting ingots to  developing ready products (including those with a high degree of  precision) for subsequent use in the mechanical engineering  complex. High-production processes which ensure production of  billets from light alloys of the requisite quality have been  implemented at all production stages.    The principal types of rolled stock are large-size slabs and  sheets from high- strength thermally hardened aluminum alloys.  This rolled stock makes it possible to reduce the number of  fastening joints in the structure thus considerably decreasing  the product mass.    Today, new practices have been developed for hot and cold  rolling of slabs and sheets with a variable cross section along  the length whose macro- and microstructure and mechanical  properties correspond to the sheets and slabs with a constant  cross section in the same shipping condition.    Sheets and bands with a textured surface and decorative  pattern are produced at specialty metallurgy plants, and  production of thin aluminum bands with embossed relief for new  structures of refrigerator and conditioner evaporators has been  assimilated. Sheets with an isotropic surface roughness are  being produced in order to improve the stamping ability and  adhesion resistance as well as to upgrade the outside appearance  of paint and varnish coats (primarily in the automotive  industry).    In the 1970s, sheet rolling production at the Samara  metallurgical plant was radically restructured. By upgrading the  hot rolling mill and installing two imported high-speed cold  rolling mills as well as a continuous heat treatment production  line, the capacity of the rolling shop producing sheets and  slabs from aluminum alloys increased by 2.5 times. During the  overhaul, large-scale production of anodized tin can band was  set up for the first time in our country.    Subsequent upgrading of the seven-stand hot rolling mill  2800  in the 1980s made it possible to increase the hot rolled coil  mass from 6 to 10 t and reduce the semifinished rolled stock  thickness from 6 to 3 mm, thus making it possible to increase  the productivity of modern high-speed cold rolling mills 1800  and 2300 and improve the rolled stock precision.    Today, a sheet rolling complex on the basis of a modern  8-stand hot rolling mill is being assembled at the Krasnoyarsk  metallurgical plant. The specialized equipment complex makes it  possible to produce large slabs from aluminum alloys with a  width of up to 2.7 and a length of up to 30 m. A unique  hardening unit with controlled jet cooling produced by the Ebner  Company ensures a high quality of slab and plate heat treatment.    Production of laminated sheets and slabs (including those  from dissimilar materials) as well as rolled-welded panels from  aluminum alloys has been set up at Russia's plants. The use of  laminated rolled stock in various fields of mechanical  engineering (in aerospace technology, shipbuilding, and rocket  building) makes it possible to use principally new structural  designs, lower the aircraft and spacecraft mass, increase the  service life characteristics, and save scarce materials.    Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with stainless steel  have been successfully used both as structural materials for  making vacuum-tight adaptors for welding products consisting of  dissimilar materials, for making containers and vessels intended  for storing corrosive liquids and biological products in  agriculture, and for producing clad metal kitchen utensils.    Aluminum alloy sheets and slabs plated with copper on one or  both sides are used for making current conducting electrical  equipment, current leads, contactors, and circuit breakers, and  repeater and radar systems; in household appliances, this  ensures a high operating reliability and saves scarce copper.    Rolled welded panels and thermal plates from aluminum and  its  alloys are used in heat exchange systems for developing  household refrigerators, heat and pressure chambers, and life  support systems and for making solar water heaters.    One hundred and eighty extrusion complexes and production  lines on the basis of horizontal hydraulic presses with a force  from 5 to 200 MN are in operation in rolling mills of specialty  metallurgy plants. They are used to produce more than 20,000  types of sections from aluminum alloys.    Commercial production of thin-walled panels with a 960-2,100  mm width and an up to 12 m length from aluminum (including  aluminum-lithium) alloys on the basis of presses with a force of  50-80-120 and 200 MN has been underway for 25 years. This unique  technology is based on extruding finned pipe and subsequently  uncoiling it into a plane on special dressing equipment.    The domestic industry is producing hot-extruded,  cold-strained, and welded pipes. In addition to making regular  round pipes, finned, rectangular, and oval-shaped pipes are also  produced. A method has been developed and specialized production  line equipment for making drilling pipes has been manufactured.    In recent years, highly efficient methods of producing  seamless tubes from aluminum alloys with an inside  corrosion-resistant coating has been developed in Russia in  recent years. Methods of making wound grain storage structures  have been developed.    Large-size stamped blanks (with a broad assortment) from  aluminum alloys are produced in vertical hydraulic stamping  presses with a force from 50 to 750 MN. Spars, beams, arm props,  chassis frames, etc., are being produced with a minimum  machining allowance.    Rolled large-size rings should be mentioned among large-size  semifinished products.    A technology of stamping piston-type parts from alloy AK12D  containing 12-14% Si has been developed at specialty  metallurgy  plants. Full-scale tests demonstrate that their wear resistance  increased by fivefold while their service life was extended by  approximately twofold.    Such branches as the aviation industry, shipbuilding,  general  mechanical engineering, chemical and petroleum machinebuilding,  and metallurgy have a need for titanium rolled stock.    Russia's titanium production set up at the VSMPO possesses  the largest smelting capacities in the world for making ingots.  With respect to the equipment range and capabilities and ingot  production, the smelting industry exceeds all other countries  taken together (120,000 t/yr). Cylindrical ingots with a  280-1,200 mm diameter and an up to 15 t mass are smelted. Double  and triple vacuum arc remelting technologies have been  implemented in production thus ensuring a high metal quality.  The autocrucible melting process which ensures chemical  homogeneity of titanium alloys and the possibility of utilizing  (up to 100%) waste and returning it back to the melt  without  preliminary grinding has been commercially implemented at the  VSMPO.    Existing production of deformed semifinished products from  titanium and its alloys carried out at the VSMPO, VILS, KMPP,  ChMZ, SMK, and other enterprises ensures a diverse assortment of  semifinished products from a wide range of alloys.    Methods of extruding titanium alloys and steels which  provided for overhauling existing hydraulic presses, heating  devices, and straightening tensile machines which have been used  before for making aluminum alloy sections was developed in the  mid-1960s for ensuring production of sections for engine frames.    Production of thin-walled sections with a minimum 1.5 mm  wall  thickness and with a surface quality which made it possible to  weld them without additional machining was set up in the early  70s. A coil method of making 0.2-0.8 mm thick sheets from  titanium alloys with a mass of 2 t has been mastered at the  VSMPO.    Due to the breakup of the USSR, Russia, being a dominant  consumer of titanium and its alloys, was left without its own  operating sources of titanium ore raw material or existing  production of alloying composition and has only a 40-45%  (of  the demand) capacity for titanium sponge production.    In the near future, the issues of supplying Russia's  titanium  industry with its own raw material, improving the rolled stock  and blank quality to the level of world standards, creating  conditions for more economic metal utilization at all process  stages, supplying all branches of the national economy with the  full range of semifinished products and blanks, and ensuring  access to the world market for Russia's titanium production must  be solved comprehensively in the near future.    The scientists working in specialty metallurgy mastered for  the first time in the 1960s vacuum arc melting of refractory  nickel alloys which subsequently was implemented at all ferrous  metallurgy plants. This made it possible considerably to improve  the metal purity. Extensive research into using electron beam  smelting has been carried out in order to improve the refractory  alloy ingot quality further. Work is underway on manufacturing  equipment and developing methods of continuous ingot casting  using intermediate foundry ladles and separating the metal  melting and solidification processes.    Yet nickel alloy blanks produced by traditional methods no  longer meet the increasing requirements of high-temperature  strength. Granular metallurgy which was borne at the VILS in the  1970s made it possible to ensure the properties of compact  blanks at the level of deformed metal properties or better and  thus eliminate deformation in a number of cases and produce  blanks with a high shape complexity and dimensional accuracy,  ensure a radical improvement in properties, and manufacture  principally new types of blanks (with a variable chemical  composition) and combined parts (discs with blades, impellers,  etc.) whose production is impossible by traditional metallurgy  methods.    Various types of specialized domestic equipment have been  developed for producing granules by the centrifugal electrode  sputtering methods and their processing and degassing, as well  as gasostats and equipment for subsequent processing and  monitoring of ready parts. A shop for producing granular  metallurgy products from refractory nickel alloys, particularly  discs and shafts for mass-produced aviation engines, has been  constructed and brought onstream. The RD-33 for MIG-29s are  equipped with discs and shafts produced by granular metallurgy  methods. Today, increasing the reliability of discs for modern  turbojet engines PS-90 and TV7-117 and passenger airliners  IL-96- 300, TU-204, and IL-114 is a high-priority task.    Development of modern aviation and specialty equipment calls  for creating new materials with a low density which have high  service characteristics. Traditional foundry and powder  metallurgy methods have virtually exhausted their capabilities  of increasing the properties of materials. In recent years,  extensive developments of materials using a principally new  method-- mechanical alloying--which differs in that all alloy  formation processes occur in the solid phase have been underway  at the VILS in recent years. This makes it possible to produce  materials with a unique combination of physical and mechanical  properties which are unattainable by other methods.    Assimilation of high-modulus aluminum-based materials for  instruments and their components whose use will make it possible  to lower the instrument mass by two- to fivefold and increase  the instrument reliability and accuracy and high-temperature and  heat resistance iron and nickel alloys for combustion chambers,  heat protection screens, nozzles, heat exchangers for high-  temperature structural fastening elements, etc., is underway.  This will make it possible to increase the operating temperature  of gas turbine engines by 100-150C made from age-hardened  titanium alloys with an elevated wear resistance. Materials on  the basis of intermetallic compounds with a reduced density and  elevated corrosion resistance are being developed for  substituting high-temperature nickel alloys in making gas  turbine engine blades.    In recent years, work has been underway on producing new  alloys by utilizing the vacuum deposition processes. The  possibility of producing aluminum alloys with an elevated  high-temperature strength for use in structural elements in  place of titanium alloys and steels is confirmed.    Composite materials with a metallic and ceramic matrix have  been generating considerable interest. Aluminum composite  materials with a discrete reinforcing agent are promising for  ensuring a low part mass combined with a high strength and  rigidity and good wear resistance. Thus, the specific rigidity  of Al-SiC materials is 1.5-2 times higher than that of  conventional structural alloys (steel and titanium and aluminum  alloys) while their specific strength is comparable to that of  titanium alloys and considerably exceeds high-strength steels.    The solution to the problem of producing materials ensuring  operation of structures at a 1,500-1,800C is closely  related to utilizing composites with a ceramic or intermetallic  matrix. Composites on the basis of silicon nitride and carbide  which are characterized in that they combine high strength and  heat conductivity with low specific gravity and coefficient of  thermal expansion are the most promising. The use of hot  isostatic pressing makes it possible to produce highly dense  blanks with a complex shape with a small finishing machining  allowance and with isotropic physical and chemical properties.    The accumulated experience of producing metallurgical  semifinished products for the defense complex must be actively  implemented under today's conditions for producing civilian  items. It is necessary to maintain the scientific and technical  potential of specialty metallurgy, support and promote  scientific developments, and lay the foundation for stable  performance of the industry in an environmental of world market  competition.    Due to a reform of economic management methods in Russia  under today's conditions and the need to merge with the  economies of the world community, there is an urgent issue of  ensuring that the metallurgical enterprises manufacture  competitive products which meet customer requirements. An  infrastructure for testing and certifying semifinished made from  light and specialty alloys in conformance with series 9000 ISO  international standard requirements must be developed for  ensuring the high competitiveness of the metallurgical products.  Setting up certification efforts will enable the metallurgical  plants to ensure high-quality product shipments to domestic  plants and earn a reputation of suppliers of high-quality  products among foreign partners.</p>

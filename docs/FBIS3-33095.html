			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Roberto Cavada -- live] </F>   [Text] We will now hear from Rebelde journalist Roberto  Cavada, who is at present out in the Escambray Mountains, where  a tour by Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina began today in  the company of the diplomatic corps accredited in Cuba. Good  evening Cavada. We are ready whenever you are.    [Cavada] Yes, thank you very much. Good evening, people of  Cuba. Once again, Cuba's Foreign Ministry has presented to (?the  world) the true architect of its diplomacy: the Cuban people.    This evening, over 40 chiefs of mission -- ambassadors,  consuls, military attaches -- left the Cuban capital to learn in  detail about all the things that the men and women of the  Escambray Mountain areas accomplish daily.    The first stop on this work tour was the Integrated Military  Enterprise of the Che Guevara Center in Manicaragua  Municipality, Villa Clara Province, very near the community of  La Campana, where the visitors were informed about the  possibilities the medical industry brings to the nation's life.  There, Brigadier General Luis Perez, an engineer and director of  the Military Enterprises Union, confirmed that over 40  factories, in addition to making and repairing all the military  material for the Revolutionary Armed Forces, are collaborating  with tourism, the nickel industry, and petroleum. In this way,  the alleged (?veils) that have always existed regarding military  information were lifted because, as Foreign Minister Robaina  said, at home, there are no hidden truths, and truth is  precisely the distinctive sign of Cuba's foreign policy, which  arises, without a doubt, from the interior of the country.    The following is the opinion of the Colombian ambassador to  Cuba:    [Begin recording] Well, as for me, I must say that [words  indistinct], because our idea is to bring businessmen, bring  people linked (?to) businesses in Colombia; and this way we can  identify the kinds of opportunities, the kind of exchange  agreements that can be realized. Thus, it is particularly useful  for the ambassadors and for me to begin learning from within how  industry is doing, how the Cuban economy is doing. [end  recording]    [Cavada] These have been exclusive details of the working  tour that began today in central Cuba for the diplomatic corps  accredited to Cuba, led by Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina.  People of Cluba, Roberto Cavada wishes you a good night.    [Havana Tele Rebelde and Cuba Vision Networks in Spanish at  0100 GMT on 18 February, in a similar report, add, to conclude  their report: Tomorrow, the group is scheduled to tour the Topes  de Collantes area and a number of Escambray Mountain areas. This  tour is part of a new offensive by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.  It is undoubtedly a way of meeting with the true protagonists of  the foreign policy on the island: our people.]</p>

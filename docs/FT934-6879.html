			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Stronger growth in the country / A look at rural and urban employment patterns For the last three decades employment in rural manufacturing companies has been growing relative to their urban counterparts. This is not so much due to relocation, but because firms in the country have been taking on proportionately more workers. At last week's Small Firms conference in Nottingham, a question posed was whether this growth in rural jobs is economically sustainable or whether businesses there may be fundamentally inefficient. Using evidence from companies that have survived and grown over a 10-year period, researchers David North and David Smallbone of Middlesex University showed markedly different employment generation patterns.* A 200 per cent increase in sales for a London company, for example, led to only a 66 per cent increase in employment; a similar sales rise for a rural business would have tripled the number of additional jobs. 'Whilst small and medium-sized enterprises in urban areas would appear to have a similar ability to achieve growth as firms elsewhere, they are more likely to achieve it in ways that minimise the number of additional workers employed directly by the firm,' Smallbone says. There are some obvious constraints on urban firms. Wage levels are higher in towns and cities; there is also a greater opportunity to subcontract, while rural companies have to be more self-sufficient. The research also shows that urban firms tend to adopt growth strategies that deliberately avoid taking on labour. Smallbone says the research does not have specific policy implications. It nevertheless suggests that those who see small firms as an important source of job creation should acknowledge the different employment patterns. On the subject of business - as opposed to employee - growth the conference heard a new paper on the Business Start Up Scheme (the name now given to what was originally the Enterprise Allowance Scheme and not to be confused with the forerunner of the Business Expansion Scheme). The EAS/BSUS was launched in 1981 as a means of supporting unemployed people wanting to make the transition to self employment. It was later handed over to the Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs) to administer. Research by Shailendra Vyakarnam and Robin Jacobs, of Transitions, a management research and development group, however, suggests much of the effort has been misplaced.** Many individuals backed by TECs have failed and few of those which survive ever progress beyond micro-businesses. 'There is evidence to suggest that growth businesses are started by teams and not by individuals,' says Vyakarnam. 'It is time to take another look at the start-up process and see if it is possible to re-design the delivery of support.' The idea that teams rather than individuals are more likely to produce businesses capable of growing is not new. Indeed when Compaq, the US computer group, was founded a decade ago it adopted the team approach and described itself as a 'big business starting small'. Studies carried out in Essex and Hertfordshire demonstrate that most putative entrepreneurs do not recognise the need for teams. The vast majority of people considering a new business had not discussed their ideas with anybody beyond their immediate family, the research showed. Vyakarnam argues that the government might have a better chance of supporting companies capable of growth if it reduced support for some of the TECs' traditional start-up programmes and backed programmes that help build teams. *David North and David Smallbone, Employment generation and small business growth in different geographical environments. **Shailendra Vyakarnam and Robin Jacobs; Teamstart - Overcoming the Blockages to small business growth.</p>

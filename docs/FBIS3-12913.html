The  sources said that the delegation will be headed by a minister  close to Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin. The sources in the PLO  leadership said that the meeting between Yasir 'Arafat and  Egyptian President Husni Mubarak in Cairo was positive; however,  it is still too early to talk of resuming the negotiations.  Moti Amir, our correspondent in Tunis, reports that the PLO  leadership feels that some tentative progress has been made  toward resuming the talks with Israel. For the time being,  however, no date has been set for their resumption.    Consultations were held at the prime minister's bureau last  night within the framework of the efforts to resume the talks  with the PLO. The participants analyzed the messages that  arrived from the PLO yesterday. Shlomo Raz, our political  correspondent, reports that the messages were delivered via  direct and indirect contacts between the Prime Minister's  Office, the Foreign Ministry, and the IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] and PLO elements in the territories and in Tunis. Among  those attending yesterday's consultations were Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres, Foreign Ministry Director General Uri Savir, and  senior IDF officers, headed by Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq.</p>

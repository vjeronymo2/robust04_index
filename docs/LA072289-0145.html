			<p><P> July 22, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUTHOR SHOWS HOW TO GET MOST THE MOST FROM PILLS  </P> <P> Sigmund Miller, author of "LifeSpan Plus," offers the following advice on  taking vitamin-mineral supplements:  </P> <P> Be sure to inform your doctor. Certain vitamins interfere with the action of  medications. L-dopa, used to treat Parkinson's disease, is reduced by taking  Vitamin B-6.  </P> <P> Take your supplements with or shortly after a meal. This ensures a higher rate  of absorption of the micronutrients.  </P> <P> Never gulp down a handful of pills with a glass of water and think of this as a  meal. Always eat healthful, wholesome food, and use vitamins as adjuncts to  your diet, not a substitute for it.  </P> <P> Take vitamins and minerals in combinations that provide the complete range of  nutritional substances. Vitamins and minerals work synergistically -- in  combination with each other.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 11 (AFP)--U.S. withdrawal of China's  most-favoured-nation (MFN) status could seriously upset China's  aim to rejoin the GATT by year's end, the world trade body's  chief said here Wednesday. While the two issues are not  directly related, MFN is an important principle within the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), GATT secretary  general Peter Sutherland said.    "Therefore the U.S. attitude, as a major contracting party  to  the Chinese integration into the world economy, will be of  considerable importance with regard to the conclusion of the  negotiation for China's full accession into the World Trade  Organisation (WTO)," Sutherland said. The WTO will replace GATT  on January 1.    If MFN is withdrawn, "it may signal difficulties vis-a-vis  the conclusion of China's re-entry to the WTO," Sutherland said.    U.S. President Bill Clinton must decide by June 3 on whether  to renew MFN, which he has made conditional on improvements in  China's human rights record. "The US attitude is of central  importance and that attitude will be signalled one way or  another by events in the MFN issue," he added.    China, which was a founding member of GATT but left after  the  communists came to power in 1949, has made it clear that it  attaches great political significance to being readmitted before  the WTO's inception. Sutherland, who met Tuesday with Foreign  Trade Minister Wu Yi, was speaking after giving a speech at an  international seminar on the Chinese economy in which he warned  that membership of the WTO was not "simply joining the club."    "It means entering into contractual undertakings based on  mutual benefit," he said. "There is a responsibility on the  part of China to show flexibility and to give adequate  assurances" to GATT members that it can honour the obligations  required by membership, he added.    While Chinese re-entry by year's end is possible, Sutherland  told reporters that it would be a "difficult task."    "It depends ultimately on the willingness of all the parties  to become extremely active in the negotiations and on the  Chinese side to be immediately responsive to the concerns about  transparency and other issues."</p>

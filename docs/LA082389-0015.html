			<p><P> August 23, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAT REFUSES TO APPEAR AT SENATE HEARING  </P> <P> Cats are famous for refusing to come when called. State Sen. Alan Robbins  learned Tuesday that that includes when they are called before a committee of  the Legislature.  </P> <P> Robbins (D-Tarzana) had his cat, Daisy, summoned as a witness before the state  Senate Judiciary Committee, which was considering a bill to require  manufacturers of cosmetic and household products to carry label notices if they  were tested on live animals.  </P> <P> The bill is aimed at discouraging such tests, which animal welfare advocates  say blind, scald and kill animals to determine whether chemicals endanger  humans.  </P> <P> Robbins wrote the bill and presumably was confident that his cat's appearance  would help it.  </P> <P> But when an aide went to Robbins' apartment to fetch Daisy, she dashed up the  fireplace chimney and refused to budge. "The cat was having none of it," the  aide explained. "That's how cats are."  </P> <P> Even without Daisy's help, the bill was sent to the full Senate by a 7-1 vote.  </P></p>

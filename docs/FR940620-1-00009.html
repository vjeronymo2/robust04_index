			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (b) The specific referral requirements of this part are limited to known or suspected criminal violations of the United States Code involving the assets, operations, or affairs of an institution. This part prescribes procedures for referring those violations to the proper Federal authorities and the Farm Credit Administration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Nothing in this part should be construed as reducing in any way an institution's responsibility to report known or suspected criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory or prosecuting authorities, whether State or Federal, even if circumstances required for a report under &sect;617.2 are not present.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Each referral required by &sect;617.2(a) shall be made on the Referral Form in accordance with the Referral Form Instructions relating to its filing and distribution and the requirements of &sect;617.2 (b) and (c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;617.2  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Referrals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Each institution and its board of directors shall exercise due diligence to ensure the discovery, investigation, and reporting of criminal activity.

In the event that a Farm Credit Bank makes a loan through a Federal land bank association which services the loan, the Farm Credit Bank has the responsibility to refer known or suspected criminal violations under this section. A report is required in circumstances where there is:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Any known or suspected criminal activity (e.g., theft, embezzlement), mysterious disappearance, unexplained shortage, misapplication, or other defalcation of property and/or funds, regardless of amount, where an institution employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution is suspected;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss (before reimbursement or recovery) of $1,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has a substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects and the suspect(s) is not an employee, officer, director, agent, or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of such an institution;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving an actual or potential loss (before reimbursement or recovery) of $5,000 or more, through false statements or other fraudulent means, where the institution has no substantial basis for identifying a possible suspect or group of suspects; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Any known or suspected criminal activity involving a financial transaction in which the institution was used as a conduit for such criminal activity (such as money laundering/structuring schemes).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) A copy of the completed Referral Form, accompanied by any relevant documentation, shall be provided to the Farm Credit Administration's Office of General Counsel no later than 30 calendar days after the institution's management, has discovered (or should have discovered) a known or suspected criminal violation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In circumstances where there is also a known or suspected violation of State or local criminal law, the institution shall also notify the appropriate State law enforcement authorities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) In addition to the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, the institution shall immediately notify by telephone the offices specified on the Referral Form upon discovery of cases involving known or suspected criminal violations requiring urgent attention or where a referable violation is ongoing. Such cases include, but are not limited to, those where:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) There is a likelihood that the suspect(s) will flee;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The magnitude or the continuation of the known or suspected criminal violation may imperil the institution's continued operation; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Key institution personnel are involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;617.3  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Notification of board of directors and bonding company.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Unless the criminal referral involves a member of the board of directors, the institution's board of directors shall be promptly notified of any criminal referral by the institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) If the criminal referral involves a member of the board of directors, discretion shall be exercised in notifying the board of directors of such a criminal referral.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) In any event, if any losses can be recovered under a surety bond or other contract for protection against losses, the institution involved shall promptly make all required notifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;617.4  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Institution responsibilities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Each institution shall establish effective policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with this part, including, but not limited to, adequate internal controls.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: June 13, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Curtis M.

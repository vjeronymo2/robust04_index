			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Strong advance for Hibernian Hibernian Group, the Dublin-based insurance and financial services company, yesterday announced a surge in 1993 pre-tax profits from IPounds 5.66m to IPounds 47.4m (Pounds 45.7m). The figure, however, was based on revised accounting policies and included IPounds 27m from investment profits, compared with previous losses of of IPounds 11.9m. Operating profits rose to Pounds 20.27m, a 16 per cent increase over 1992's Pounds 17.53m. The group's core general insurance business performed strongly in 1993, despite an increase in claims related to adverse weather. Profits of the division rose by IPounds 1.4m to IPounds 16.8m on the back of a 13 per cent increase in gross written general insurance premiums to Pounds 200.4m. Hibernian has been expanding into the UK and has 16 offices, which brought in IPounds 27m of premium income, an 18 per cent increase from 1992. It has also been building up its life insurance business, which contributed Pounds 3.4m, an increase of 63 per cent, aided by a broader range of products. Investment profits, including unrealised gains, reflected the performance of Irish equities and bonds following last year's devaluation of the punt, which also increased translated profits on overseas holdings. Mr Cecil Hayes, general manager finance, said the investment performance under the new accounting policy would be volatile, but it had averaged a IPounds 3m profit over the past decade. The company is continuing to expand its life assurance business and broaden its exposure to the UK. Earnings per share, pre-investment profits but after tax, amounted to 26.2p (22.6p). A recommended final dividend of 4.7p makes a 7p (6.2p) total.</p>

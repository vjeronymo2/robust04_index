Almost 50  percent of respondents to a public opinion poll believe that the  present government will stay in power for more than a year.    Over the last two years, the number of people who support  the  idea of increasing the president's influence on the work of the  government has decreased. Forty percent of respondents believe  that the policy of the government offers a chance for overcoming  the crisis, even though since November the number of optimists  has decreased quite noticeably (by almost 15 percent). For the  first time since the Pawlak government was formed, 37 percent of  Poles are of the opinion that this government is neither better  nor worse than the previous one; 34 percent believe it is better.    This research study was conducted by the Public Opinion  Research Center [CBOS] between 14 and 17 January with a  representative sample of adult Poles.</p>

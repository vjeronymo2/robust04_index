			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, 28 Feb (XINHUA) -- A Foreign Ministry  spokesman today made public facts concerning several major  issues in the Sino-British talks on the 1994-95 election  arrangements in Hong Kong.    The spokesman pointed out: From April to November 1993,  representatives of the Chinese and the British Governments held  17 rounds of talks on the 1994-95 election arrangements in Hong  Kong. Prior to the talks, the two countries reached an  understanding of confidentiality of the contents of talks. Now  the British, without having consultation with China, have  unilaterally published the contents of the talks, distorting and  attacking the Chinese stance in an attempt to shift  responsibility for disruption of the talks. China is compelled  to make public relevant talks on this to ensure a correct  understanding of the facts.    The facts published by the spokesman concerning several  major  issues in the Sino-British talks consist of seven issues and a  postscript. The seven issues are: 1) Britain obstinately clings  to the "three violations" political system program during the  talks; 2) Britain attempts to interfere with affairs which fall  within the scope of Chinese sovereignty; 3) The agreement and  understanding reached between the two countries on the issue of  the Election Committee must be honored; 4) The original  intention of functional constituency elections must be upheld;  5) The issue of the "through train" can only be resolved within  the scope of the National People's Congress decision and the  relevant provisions of the Basic Law; 6) China has exerted great  efforts to reach agreement on the issue of election arrangements  of regional organizations; and 7) Britain has deliberately  disrupted the talks.    The spokesman pointed out: The essence of the dispute  between China and Britain on the issue of Hong Kong's political  system is not a question of whether or not we want to develop  democracy, but one of whether or not we should keep good faith  internationally and converge the Basic Law with the realization  of Hong Kong's smooth transition. The dispute has been started  by the changes in Britain's policy toward Hong Kong. Facts will  prove that such changes do not conform with Britain's interests  and will cause damage to Hong Kong.    The latest Sino-British talks have broken down because of  Britain's disruption. China deems it necessary to sternly  reiterated that in accordance with the stipulations of the Sino-  British Joint Declaration, British administration of Hong Kong  ends on 30 June 1997, and the Chinese Government will resume the  exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on 1 July 1997. The  components of the political system structure of the British  administration of Hong Kong -- the last British Hong Kong  District Board, the two municipal councils, and the Legislative  Council -- must be dissolved along with the end of the British  administration period. From 1 July 1997, the political system  structure of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region will be  organized and established according to the NPC decision and the  relevant provisions of the Basic Law.    In conclusion, the spokesman emphatically pointed out:  Nobody can obstruct Hong Kong's forthcoming return to the  motherland's embrace. The Chinese Government and people are  entirely confident that they will be able to resume the exercise  of sovereignty over Hong Kong on schedule, and to implement the  principle of "one country, two systems" and the Basic Law to  preserve Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.</p>

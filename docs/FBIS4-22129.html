			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Ankara, MILLIYET -- It has been reported that  the fundamentalist illegal organization called the Islamic Great  Eastern Raiders-Front [Islami Buyuk Dogu Akincilar-Cephesi]  [IGER-F] was responsible for staging demonstrations in several  big cities, especially in Ankara and Istanbul, and stoning the  U.S. Embassy, as well as the TRT, the UN, and the True Path  Party headquarters. An investigation has been launched with  regard to the demonstrations.    Ankara Security Directorate officials stated that for the  past month the IGER-F has been waiting for a suitable  opportunity to promote itself and win sympathizers in all parts  of the country. The organization decided to stage actions  throughout the country following reports of attacks against  Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. [passage omitted]  <H5>  What Is IGER-F? </H5>   The aim of this illegal organization is cited as "changing  the existing constitutional order through the use of force, and  replacing it with a federal state under the name of United  Islamic State, which will incorporate all Middle Eastern  countries." The organization, which emerged in 1990, acts under  the slogan of armed struggle for a fundamentalist order and  undertakes bombings and armed attacks to achieve this goal. The  leader of the organization is Izzet Erdis, who is otherwise  known as Salih Mirzabeyoglu.  <H5>  Demiral's Confirmation </H5>   Nusret Demiral, chief prosecutor of the Ankara State  Security  Court, has confirmed that the incidents of two days ago were  directed by the illegal pro-fundamentalist IGER-F organization.  Demiral said: "Our work concerning the organization is  continuing. Our videos also clearly show that the persons who  guided the demonstrators are militants of this organization.  The investigation about them is being conducted in accordance  with the first and seventh articles of the anti-terror law."</p>

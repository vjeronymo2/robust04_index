			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / FT Christmas Books: The pick of the publishing year - From politics to poetry, history to humour - our writers choose the best books of 1994 Value for money this year has to be Italo Calvino's Italian Folk Tales (Penguin, Pounds 12.99). Purchased for my seven year old son last Christmas, this collection of ancient tales brilliantly re-told by Calvino in his spare but lucid style has provided pleasure and nourishment for parent and child alike night after night after night, and nearly a year on is still not finished. For inspiration my choice this year has to be Will Self's Grey Area and Other Stories (Bloomsbury, Pounds 9.99), a beautiful collection of Nathaniel West-ish tales which manage to combine the quirky stylistic devices which we know and love from The Quantity Theory of Insanity (characters from one story reappearing in another, for instance) with a chilling moral diagnosis of all that is wrong with our society. Finally, for pleasure, it has to be Robert Louis Stevenson's Kidnapped (Everyman Library, Pounds 9.99). I live in Enniskillen but I work in Belfast and I do my reading shuttling on the bus between the two. I hate that journey, but with Kidnapped in my hands I forgot entirely where I was because emotionally and imaginatively I was in Scotland. Some of the scenes had me in tears, while others made me laugh out loud. Thank God for Stevenson - fully rounded characters, and a story which touches the reader's heart.</p>

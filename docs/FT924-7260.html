			<p>921117 FT  17 NOV 92 / Survey of Business Travel (18): Only the best connections - Stewart Dalby pages through the guides to countries and airways THE BIBLE for air travellers going from or through Britain has long been the ABC World Airways Guide, published by the Reed Travel Group. This year, following extensive research, Reed has published an upgraded version of the guide called, ABC World Airways Corporate Edition. As well as steering air travellers through the complexities of airline schedules (it includes information on 450,000 domestic and international flight schedules and connections for the world's airlines), the guide gives full airport and destination details, a survey of airlines' business classes, airline seating plans, travel clubs/lounges, duty free shops, transport to city centres, car rentals, currency, business hours and public holidays, passport/visa requirements, vaccinations, hotel details, city maps and business and social hints. ABC World Airways Corporate Edition is published monthly in two volumes. An annual subscription costs Pounds 306. For business travellers who like to plan their own itineraries or to make changes en route there is a family of three pocket - sized ABC Executive Flight Planners. These are condensed versions of the ABC World Airways Guide. They are also published monthly and cover Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia and Pacific, and the Americas. Each one includes details of direct flights to, from, and within each region, plus the most useful transfer connections. An annual subscription for 12 monthly editions costs Pounds 69. Reed Travel Group is in Church Street, Dunstable, Bedfordshire, LU5 4HB (telephone 0581 600111). A third publication by the Reed Travel Group is the ABC Rail Guide, which includes timetables and fares. Updated every month, it covers all services in London and southern England, with complete details of rail services and fares between all Britain's main towns and cities. It costs Pounds 72 for an annual subscription from the publishers. It is also available from most leading bookshops, price Pounds 5.25. For European connections and rail routes, a goodguide is Thomas Cook European Rail Timetable. This costs Pounds 7.95, including postage, or is available on an annual subscription for Pounds 95 from Thomas Cook Travel Management, PO Box 36 Thorpe Road, Peterborough PE3 6SB. Thomas Cook publishes a number of other specialised books on air travelas well as its renowned guidebooks. Some of these are also available in a computer disk format, for an IBM-compatible personal computer. During the 1980s so many general travel and guide books were published that the choice is endless. Sarah Anderson and Simon Gaul, the joint proprietors of the Travel Bookshop, have written, A Guide to Guide Books Abroad, 1992, published by Thomas Cook at 50p. The Travel Bookshop is in London's Notting Hill at 13 Blenheim Crescent, London, W11 2EE (telephone 071 229 5260). The pamphlet makes the point that original guide books published in the 19th Century, such as Baedekers, John Murray, Cooks and Augustus Hare, are worth collecting and are also good value in revised editions. Many travellers today still find them useful because of the good descriptions they often provide of buildings. Another point which emerges is the predominance of two different types of guide - those catering for economy travellers for and those aimed at tourists in search of culture or gourmet food. Among the success stories in the 1980s have been Rough Guides and Lonely Planet publications, which tell how to travel cheaply. For slightly better - off tourists, Michelin guides, Travellers Handbooks and Blue Guides remain great favourites. Four other guide series, in particular, are worth mentioning. Fodor, a US group, is long established and publishes a wide range. They list top hotels and good restaurants. They are updated each year, and cater mainly for American travellers. Fodor guides cost just under Pounds 10 in the UK. Diplomatic and business contacts who travel frequently in eastern Europe swear by Insight guides. They are often written by local authors and the first chapters consist of a series of essays on history and culture. Simon Gaul at the Travel Bookshop recommends the Cadogan guides, which are relative newcomers and are aimed at the upmarket traveller. They are well produced and seem well suited to the business traveller. The Berlin guide, for example, opens with practical hints, followed by sections on history, suggestions for walks and other attractions. Prices for Cadogan guides start from Pounds 9.95. I prefer The Economist guides which have sections on the economic scene, the industrial scene, business awareness planning and reference, as well as practical information such as the addresses of embassies. But a problem in being so succinct and topical is that these guides quickly become out of date.</p>

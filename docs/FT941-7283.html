			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Leading Article: Yeltsin bends to the winds The west can no longer base its policies on the assumptions that Russia will manage market-oriented reform, remain democratic and continue to be co-operative. But it must also prevent prophecies of doom from becoming self-fulfilling. Unfortunately, past performance does not suggest it will walk this tightrope with skill. Russia's more assertive stance in eastern Europe and the Balkans, a spy scandal in Washington, the decision of the parliament to grant amnesty to organisers of last October's uprising and Mr Yeltsin's speech yesterday all give cause for concern, particularly after the election results and the resignation of reformers from the government. The speech shows how far the Russian president feels obliged to adopt the attitudes of his opponents. It also demonstrates the lack of any coherent economy policy. What were Mr Yeltsin's main themes? That the Russian state must be strengthened; that it must defend Russians living in the 'near abroad'; that Nato must not expand; and, finally, that the tax burden must be cut, while both the poor and a range of strategic industries are helped. What, other than that the Russian president is confused, can be concluded from this litany? One conclusion is that a weakened Mr Yeltsin is trying to marry the reforming hedgehog with the reactionary snake, the mistake for which he once condemned Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. A second is that this is unlikely to endure. Yesterday the rouble fell from 1,624 against the US dollar to 1,657. Accelerating inflation is unlikely to prove a workable - still less a palatable - way of bridging the gap between claims upon the state and the inability of that cadaver to meet them. This government will soon find itself in dire straits. The west must be able to respond to that eventuality, for it is conceivable - if unlikely - that another window for reform would then emerge. The meeting of the finance ministers and central bank governors of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries in Germany this weekend is the occasion for discussing what it would then do. Apparently, the finance ministers and central bank governors intend to ask the new Russian government to assure them of its determination to bring the country's inflation under control. In return, they hope to liberate the funds agreed at the last world economic summit in Tokyo. Nothing could be more ill-timed. The assurances would be worthless, and aiding a government that has no real commitment to reform, after failing to aid one that did, would be typically absurd. Western policy must be a nuanced holding operation. Russia is not yet a reliable friend. Nor is it a convinced enemy. The west bears part of the blame for the failure to achieve the former. It must avoid acting now in ways that guarantee the latter. The only possible approach is to respond to provocation, while encouraging co-operation. It will not be easy. But who imagined it would be?</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Budget View: Gilts need a manifesto WHAT HAS has been the most significant development in the British economy over the past year? Most people would probably say the 2 1/2 per cent fall in national income. For Norman Lamont in his Budget speech on Tuesday, however, it was the sharp and sustained reduction in inflation. I would not mock this judgment, selective though it may have been. Low inflation, when it is achieved, tends to be taken for granted. But it has to be fought for, and sacrifices must be made. During the coming election campaign there will be many promises of kick-starts and recovery engines, but few convincing pledges by the politicians that honest money will always come first. It is just as well that the stuffy Bundesbank stands ultimately at the centre of the European Monetary System. Of course, inflation itself does not at present seem to be a problem while the economy is so depressed. You still have to be worried that average pay continues to rise as rapidly as 7 1/4 per cent, with the public sector taking the lead - as it often does at this stage of the economic and political cycle, before a new government is forced to bring the public sector's finances back under control. But harsh reality over pay prospects will eventually sink in. The worry is in these depressed conditions that, nevertheless, the seeds can be sown of renewed inflation. Nigel Lawson fatally relaxed monetary policy in 1985. But now the British government has largely let go the reins of monetary policy by hooking sterling up to the Continental currencies. So six long, recessionary months have passed since sterling short-term interest rates last fell. Because of the tradition that politicians entirely keep their hands off interest rates during an election campaign there must - barring huge pressures on the sterling exchange rate - be at least another month with base rates at 10 1/2 per cent. Government supporters are disappointed that Norman Lamont has not been able to throw a half-point cut into the pre-election pot: the realisation that this would not after all happen this week was an important factor behind the stock market's 50-point fall on Wednesday. But there is another way of looking at interest rates, in real terms. On that basis, rates have actually been rising. When short-term rates hit 10 1/2 per cent in September the headline inflation rate was 4.7 per cent. Now it is 4.1 per cent, and it may not be much more than 3 per cent over the next year. With a real interest rate of 7 per cent-plus to encourage savers and dismay borrowers it is not surprising that Norman Lamont's economic recovery is forever just around the corner. In theory a better idea of real interest rates and inflationary expectations over the longer run can be gleaned from the government bond market, which has this week looked groggy as investors have gulped at the future borrowing requirements. The inflation-proofed real return available on index-linked gilts is about 4.4 per cent, but the corresponding fixed interest yield is 9.5 per cent. By implication the market is anticipating inflation in the long term of just over 5 per cent a year. At the time of the last Budget the figure was 6 per cent, and a year before that 7.5 per cent, so there is steady progress. Yet the market is still far from being convinced that the UK will enter the promised land of 2 to 3 per cent inflation forecast for the mid-1990s in the Treasury's annual Red Book of economic magic. If that target is reached, gilts yielding 9.5 per cent will turn out to be tremendous bargains. Not only will you start with juicy real returns but you can expect to make substantial capital gains - say, 25 per cent on a 15-year gilt - as nominal yields sink to between 6 and 7 per cent over the next few years. You might expect a total return of 15 per cent a year over the next four or five years, surely a more attractive prospect than for equities, which have returned 12 per cent a year on average since 1987. But is it believable? Government securities that are highly profitable for investors must be very expensive for governments (or more accurately, for taxpayers). Moreover, it will be odd if wealthy savers are able to prosper in a depressed economy. If a Labour government were in power then there certainly would be attempts to claw the abnormal investment returns back through taxation. More cynically one would say that a government with a big borrowing requirement has a vested interest in inflation. Borrowing, as we saw in Lamont's Budget, is an easy way out for a beleaguered finance minister. In 1990 John Major saw inflation running out of control, destroying the Tories' election chances. Joining the exchange rate mechanism seemed the only way to get inflation down quickly, and it has worked impeccably. Unfortunately, with a series of possible election dates coming up, it was never possible to warn the country candidly of the cost. Norman Lamont's sense of priorities is valid but, as we may discover on April 9, a few million others may with equal validity beg to differ. The Budget and You, Pages II to VII.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] [Passage indistinct] There have been clashes at  Kolouka. Our reporter Soumana Boubacar visited the scene of the  clashes. His report, due to its poor sound quality, is  interpreted in the studio by our reporter Ibounge.    [Ibounge] Indeed, according to Soumana Boubacar, the clashes  are taking place, as you said, at Kolouka, a small village 5 km  away from Bani Bangou. Violent and bloody clashes between  defense and security forces and Muslim fundamentalists have been  taking place there for the past three days. Here is the  chronology of events as narrated by our correspondent:    At 1400 on 11 April, the brigade commander of Bani Bangou  Gendarmerie took six of his men and proceeded to Kolouka to  arrest five Muslim fundamentalists following a radio message  transmitted from Oualam. On arrival at Kolouka, our gendarmes  met with fierce resistance and violent clashes ensued. The  Muslim fundamentalists, believing in their invulnerability,  crushed and beat the seven gendarmes to death and on the same  day declared their village a no-go area.    Yesterday morning, the prefect of Tillabery travelled to  Bani  Bangou to present his condolences to the bereaved families of  the seven gendarmes, and yesterday afternoon, an impressive  detachment of gendarmes and republican guards under the command  of Captain Ibrahim Moussa left Bani Bangou for Kolouka with the  mission to capture the fundamentalists responsible for the death  of the seven gendarmes. There was a new development this time:  a media representative was included in the convoy.    One may note that after several unheeded warnings, the  gendarmes and republican guards fired teargas at the  fundamentalists but they surged forward without any problem.  The defense and security men therefore opened fire but all to  no avail. The Kolouka Muslim fundamentalists -- under the  influence of drugs according to Soumana Boubacar -- were not  impressed by the intense firing and continued to advance. Then  came the retreat order. However, misfortune set in. A vehicle  belonging to the Republican Guard broke down. The occupants  tried to flee. One of them was caught by the fundamentalists  but before dying he managed, miraculously, to kill two  fundamentalists. The detachment then returned to Bani Bangou.  One republican guard, (Alga Dizabai), and two fundamentalists  died in yesterday's clash.    According to the latest information, the fundamentalists  plan  to march on Bani Bangou, which at any rate is under their  control as the gendarmes and republican guards have retreated to  Baleyara. Soumana Boubacar reports, however, that soldiers based  at (Kinoua) are reported to have cordoned off the area.</p>

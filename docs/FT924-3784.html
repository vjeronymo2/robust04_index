			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK Company News: BAe Dutch move prompts Ballast chairman to leave BRITISH Aerospace has decided against hiving off its Dutch construction subsidiary, Ballast Nedam, prompting the Dutch company's chairman to announce his resignation. Mr Willem Maeyer, who has spent the past year looking into the possibility of a partial or full buy-out, to be followed by a bourse flotation, is to resign at the end of this month. Until a successor is named, Mr Maeyer's job will be taken over by Mr Arie Glimmerveen, a former management board chairman who is now chairman of Ballast Nedam's supervisory board. Ballast Nedam said the move was the result of a decision by BAe against a buy-out, but it did not say what the future of the company would be. In the summer, Ballast Nedam informed its workforce that the company, or parts of it, may be hived off from the loss-making BAe group, which is undergoing a restructuring. At the time, an eventual bourse flotation was not ruled out. BAe acquired Ballast Nedam in 1987, mainly because of the Dutch company's wide experience of construction projects in the Middle East. Ballast Nedam, which built the causeway linking Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, was to be given a pivotal role in construction orders tied to the massive Saudi Arabian orders won by BAe for Tornado jet combat aircraft. However, plans to construct the Sulayil air base as part of the order were later shelved.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with General Rose, British commander of the UN </F> Blue Helmets in Bosnia, by Renaud Girard in Sarajevo; date not  given: "New Tensions on all Fronts in Bosnia-Herzegovina --  General Rose: `No NATO Bomb Will Be Dropped Without My Order'"]    [Text] Born in 1940 in Quetta, in the region of  British India which was to become Pakistan, General Michael Rose  is considered as one to Her Majesty's most brilliant soldiers. A  paratrooper, he is also an Oxford graduate. In 1982, during the  Falkland war, he was in command of the 22d SAS Regiment (Special  Air Service, the British Army's elite commando corps). After  becoming army chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Rose took  command on 5 January of the UN Protection Forces [UNPROFOR] in  Bosnia-Herzegovina.  <H5>  New Air Strike Doctrine </H5>   In an interview with LE FIGARO, he explains the new doctrine  on the use of air power as part of a UN peacekeeping operation.  Indeed, this is the first time UN ground soldiers on a  peacekeeping mission are given air support -- here from NATO  aircraft.    [Girard] Before the weekend there still were a few Serbian  gun batteries -- for instance at Osijek -- which were not under  UNPROFOR control, despite NATO's ultimatum. How do you explain  this? What are you going to do about it?    [Rose] The UNPROFOR has not yet succeeded in getting all  heavy weapons on all sites under control. First of all because  of the weather. Collecting all weapons was very difficult.  Second, the Serbs did not manage to carry out such a task as  efficiently as they thought they would: Their army is rather  poorly structured, it is only a loose collection of militias.  Third, they consider they never agreed to disarm, only to place  their weapons under UN control. There has been some confusion  at lower echelons.    [Girard] And yet NATO's ultimatum was very clear...    [Rose] Indeed, and we could have taken a much tougher stand.  We chose to be understanding to avoid negative repercussions on  our action as a whole. The goodwill of the Bosnian Serbs is  real, as we can see from our daily meetings with (their  "President") Radovan Karadzic. Serbian officials say: "We are  having difficulties, but we want to disarm and we are doing it.  Stop hassling us!" Basically, Serbian militia men are totally  confused, and this is the reason why we do not push as hard as  we could. However, I can certify that they cannot resume  artillery fire without first having to fight us. We removed  essential parts from their weapons, which means that,  technically, these guns are under our control, even if their  being scattered all over the place is an inconvenience. And the  situation is getting better every day.    [Girard] The Bosnian presidency stated that at least five  Serbian batteries remained out of UN control...    [Rose] We act every time reconnaissance aircraft identify  new heavy weapons. Often, the Serbs will have forgotten they  had placed guns here or there. These are abandoned guns which  they had not used in a long time. Nevertheless, I will not let  myself be diverted from my main goal: the peace process. This  is more than a mere cease-fire. We want to turn Sarajevo into a  European city again, an open city with a normal life. LE FIGARO  mentioned the risk of the siege becoming institutionalized, as  in Nicosia. I repeat, we do not want that. We have already  achieved a lot.  <H5>  `Totally in Phase With NATO' </H5>   [Girard] There are still incidents, light weapon fire. Are  you not afraid of the Serbs slowly chipping away at the  cease-fire?    [Rose] This is a real danger. The Serbs charged the  Bosnians with trying to advance their front-line positions at  four different places. If this is true, it is unacceptable. I  am going to visit those places: If trenches have indeed been  moved, I will demand that the Bosnian Army return to the  positions it held when the cease-fire took effect.    [Girard] Everyone could see over the last three weeks that  there was a substantial discrepancy between NATO's discourse,  which has been rather "hawkish," and that of the United Nations,  more on the "dovey" side. How do you overcome the contradiction?    [Rose] I can only comment from a tactical viewpoint, my own.  (...) But I can tell you that since 9 February, the day when I  laid the foundation of a peace agreement with the Serbs and the  Muslims, I have been totally in phase with NATO. You may have  noted that some terms of the Brussels' communique (NATO's  ultimatum issued on the night of 9 February) seem to have been  directly taken from the agreement signed by the Serbs and the  Bosnians. The ultimatum reinforced our peace plan.    [Girard] Were you absolutely certain that NATO Southern Area  Commander Admiral Boorda would only send out his planes on your  request?    [Rose] Absolutely. There must be no doubt about it: NATO  is here only as a support force. And it is a first: A regional  defense organization coming to support a UN peacekeeping force.  I am positive: Not a single NATO bomb will be dropped without  my order. With the exception of a plane acting in self-defense,  of course.    [Girard] Was your tactical approach -- enforcing the cease-  fire and sending Blue Helmets to guard Serb batteries -- not  inconsistent with a strategic decision to perform even a  symbolic strike in order to convince the Serbs of Western  determination?    [Girard] I am very clear on the matter. Our first priority  is to make sure humanitarian aid comes through. This is a  matter of survival for 2,700,000 people in Bosnia. Our second  priority is to facilitate the creation of safe havens, one of  them being Sarajevo. We will be able to carry out such missions  as long as we remain noncombatants. As soon as we become  combatants -- see what happened in Somalia -- we become helpless.  <H5>  `Our Planes Would Blow It to Smithereens' </H5>   There is one question left: How do we reconcile air strikes  and continued noncombatant status? Simple: The use of air  power must remain proportional and strictly connected to this or  that violation of the ultimatum. It must be a way to strike  back, not to change the military balance or the political  landscape. I developed a number of principles:    -- Any strike must be directed at the guilty party.    -- It must be proportionate: You are not going to destroy a  whole army because someone fired at you once.    -- It is necessary to determine in the field whether the  target is a legitimate one.    [Girard] Meaning... ?    [Rose] Let us take an example. Very recently, a U.S. plane  told us about hostile fire, speculating that it might have been  a 20-mm three-tube cannon (a weapon banned by the ultimatum).  We sent a military monitor to check it out and it turned out  that it had been only a young man wasting his 12.7-mm machine  gun's ammunition for the hell of it. This cretin was not worth  an air strike. However, should an artillery regiment -- on  whatever side -- attempt to reassemble and to fire on or from  Sarajevo, then our planes would blow it to smithereens.    [Girard] Then weapons will now surely remain silent in  Sarajevo?    [Rose] Both armies have now gotten as far as was possible  for them. Without their artillery, the Serbs cannot conquer any  more land, supposing they want to. (...) The Bosnians know  that they cannot substantially alter the military situation with  ground soldiers only. They have been paying attention to  Western pressure. In Sarajevo, we have reached a kind of climax  as far as military operations are concerned, which will make it  possible for the peace plan to be implemented.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Adolfo Miranda Saenz] </F>   [Text] I am motivated to write on this issue because three  prominent liberals have discussed it recently: the president of  the PLIUN [Independent Liberal Party for National Unity], Dr.  Alfonso Moncada, in an article on LA PRENSA's opinion page; Dr.  Guillermo Selva, a director of the PLI [Independent Liberal  Party] in an interview with LA PRENSA; and the president of the  PLC [Constitutionalist Liberal Party], Dr. Arnoldo Aleman, on  Radio Corporacion.    As the president of the PLIUN, Dr. Alfonso Moncada, says,  with the collapse of socialism the liberal principles that exalt  man are gaining more currency than ever. Humanist liberalism.  The social liberalism that advocates equal opportunity, social  and economic justice, truly fraternal relations among the  members of society, and broad freedoms.    I am talking about progressive, revolutionary liberalism  (even though at times these words may seem discredited), which  has nothing to do with the economic neoliberalism that makes the  poor poorer. Now that socialism has failed, progressive,  revolutionary liberalism is one of the hopes for the world's  poor.    Nicaragua needs such progressive, revolutionary liberalism.  Regrettably, however, the PALI [Liberal Party] (which has no  further names and sports a plain red flag with neither symbols  nor letters) is split and thus unable to develop its full  potential. We must seek liberal unity.    I will mention Dr. Moncada once again, acknowledging that he  is right when he says that liberal alliances can be established  with parties that have a liberal ideological foundation even  though they do not call themselves liberal. I am thus  enthusiastic about the fact that the PLIUN, the PUCA [Central  American Unionist Party], and the PJN [National Justice Party]  (which is predominantly Evangelical Protestant) are coming  together to seek solutions to the nation's problems. Unity for  change.    But this does not rule out efforts towards unity among all  liberals. I thus would like to bring up once again a point on  which Dr. Arnoldo Aleman and Dr. Alfonso Moncada agree: a  liberal plebiscite.    The liberal rank and file need to be summoned to a  plebiscite  from which will emerge a broad-based convention that will unite  the Liberal Party (without any other names, with a single flag  and a single anthem: the "Beautiful Sovereign"). Each liberal  faction or group would run its slate of candidates for  convention delegates in each municipality, and the delegates  would then be chosen in proportion to their vote so that all  groups (PLIUN, PLI, PLC, PALI, etc.) would be represented  proportionally no matter how small they may be.    But let us not forget our brothers in the PUCA and the PJN.  Their liberal roots run deep and are long-standing. Ever since  Zelaya and even before it there has been a strategic liberal  identification with the Morazan Central Americanists and the  Evangelical Protestants, and thus we will have to include them  in any plans for liberal unity. All the more so now that they  have joined with the PLIUN in seeking political solutions to the  problems of our people.    Nonetheless, what the head of the PLI, Dr. Guillermo Selva,  said also makes a great deal of sense. Although there would be a  plebiscite for total unity, that would take time and cost money.  This is why I agree with him that the first step would be to  form the Liberal Federation with all liberal parties or parties  holding a liberal philosophy, without exclusions, and on an  equal footing (until we count heads to find out how strong each  group is).    Why wait any longer? Yours truly is a member of the PLIUN  but  not an officer. At least not now. I am thus publicly challenging  the Boards of Directors to see which one will take the  initiative and, paying more attention to common ground than  differences (which we naturally have, since there are "wings" or  "factions" in every party), invite the others to begin talks  towards a Liberal Federation. Like many other liberals, I am  ready to work and contribute in whatever modest way I can to  achieve liberal unity.    But the floor now belongs to party officials like Dr.  Virgilio Godoy, Dr. Arnoldo Aleman, Dr. Alfonso Moncada, etc. I  am issuing the challenge...let us see who takes it up.    Let me go somewhat further. We must do more than seek  liberal  unity. For the good of Nicaragua each political family must seek  its own unity. The Conservatives. The Marxists. The Social  Christians. This would strengthen Nicaragua politically, because  it is absurd for such a small country to have so many parties.</p>

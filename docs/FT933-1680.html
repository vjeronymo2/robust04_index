			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Crisis in Russia: Reform still selling down on Karl Marx St KARL Marx Street in the centre of Irkutsk is typical of the market reforms sweeping Russia's provinces. Walk into any shop and you will find a wide range goods, which became available only after the Russian government freed prices and imports in January last year. Employees in the corner grocery store, clad in filthy white uniforms, look and behave much the same as they did before the shop was privatised. A wall-poster on an elegant pre-revolutionary building advertises evening courses in accounting, management and 'other skills essential for succeeding in a market economy'. But, as in the rest of provincial Russia, continued progress in Irkutsk - the province and provincial capital 4,000km east of Moscow - has been threatened by the political battle in Moscow. Irkutsk has 3m inhabitants, is the size of Turkey, and is in eastern Siberia, close to the Mongolian border. It is primarily a mineral-rich area, containing Russia's biggest hard rock gold deposit. For the shoppers on Karl Marx Street, reform has been harsh and bewildering. High prices in the shops make all but basic staples unaffordable for many. But grudging popular support among local people helped to pave the way for Mr Yeltsin's decision on Tuesday to replace the old-style parliament with new elections. Irina, a middle-aged nurse earning Rbs47,000 (Pounds 30) a month, said: 'We have always been poor. Now we have the freedom to do what we want so at least that's an improvement. We like Yeltsin, we feel that he's our muzhik (guy), but you get the impression that they're always throwing a spanner in the works.' She was referring to the Russian parliament and everybody else whom President Yeltsin has accused of blocking reforms. Yevgeny, a young architect, says the present government must be allowed 'to get on with the job, and then you can judge them.' He added: 'But this way, nobody is taking responsibility for anything.' The reaction of Yuri, a worker at a plant beside Lake Baikal, seems to reflect disenchantment with the spectacle of squabbling politicians. 'The parliament is in the way and should be got rid of,' he said. The infighting in Moscow has also meant that a federation treaty that was due to devolve power to the regions, has not yet been applied. This in turn has threatened to pull the country apart, with individual regions and republics competing with each other to transfer as little tax as possible to the centre while gaining as much power as possible. While Moscow still determines matters as trivial as fishing and hunting regulations for Irkutsk's rich lakes and forests, decision-making on more substantial issues, such as the mining of its rich mineral deposits, is paralysed. 'No wonder they say laws are not being applied. Moscow can no longer decide everything from so far away,' says Mr Victor Ignatenko, head of the regional parliament. The challenge for Mr Yeltsin is to take up the understandable grievances in the regions and republics. Many regions are simply grabbing whatever rights they can in the mean time. When a few Russian provinces this summer declared themselves 'republics' - a superior administrative entity designed by the communist authorities to give ethnic minorities a semblance of statehood - cautious Irkutsk decided against following their example.</p>

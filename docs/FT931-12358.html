			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Observer: Double up in t'pit It may be old hat these days to talk about there being reds under the bed. But it is rare indeed to find a public figure who has actually shared one with miners' leader Arthur Scargill, especially when the figure is Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the cross-party committee which is about to reveal how to save Britain's coal industry. Caborn, MP for Sheffield Central, says the reason for the sleeping partnership was that his brother David was a friend of both Scargill and former shipbuilders' union chief, Jimmy Reid, who used to visit the Caborn family's small house and occasionally stay overnight. But the MP stresses that, although he shared a bed with the fiery miner, they did not share a pillow. They slept head to toe.</p>

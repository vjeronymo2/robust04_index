			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 8 (YONHAP) -- There will be no special  pardon for imprisoned criminals this year in commemoration of  Buddha's birthday next week, the Justice Ministry said Sunday.  The government will minimize the number of felons released from  special amnesty granted during national holidays every year and  refer the convicted criminals to the regular release on the 20th  of every month, the Ministry said.    Ministry officials said the change is due to rising number  of  repeat offenses by those who have been released on holiday  amnesty. There was also concern that the release of security law  violators was weakening the seriousness of the law, they said.    Special holiday amnesty released approximately 100 more  criminals than during monthly pardon. The change in government  release is expected to reduce the number of pardoned criminals  by 400 to 500 a year.</p>

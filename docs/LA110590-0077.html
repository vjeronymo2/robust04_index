			<p><P> November 5, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTHORITIES FIND COCAINE IN SPACE SHUTTLE HANGAR;  </P> <P> DRUGS: AN INVESTIGATION IS LAUNCHED AFTER A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE NARCOTIC IS  FOUND IN A DESK USED BY SEVERAL PEOPLE. NO ARRESTS HAVE BEEN MADE.  </P> <P> A small amount of cocaine was found here in a hangar where space shuttles are  readied for launch, NASA officials said Sunday.  </P> <P> Space agency spokesman Karl Kristofferson said the drug was found early Friday  in an orbiter processing facility, one of two at the space center.  </P> <P> It is the first time cocaine has been found at the Kennedy Space Center.  </P> <P> In 1985, marijuana plants were discovered growing in isolated areas of the  Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge where the space center is located, but the case  did not involve NASA personnel.  </P> <P> NASA spokesman Hugh Harris said the cocaine was found under a desk that is used  by more than one person.  </P> <P> "It is a very small amount," Harris said. "Security doesn't want to talk about  any details until they do more of their investigation."  </P> <P> NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone told the Florida Today newspaper Saturday that the  drug seizure "is considered an isolated incident."  </P> <P> Malone said she did not know how much cocaine was involved. Officials said they  did not yet know who owned the drug, and no arrests have been made.  </P> <P> The investigation is led by security officers from NASA, Lockheed Space  Operations Co. and EG&amp;G Florida Inc.  </P> <P> Lockheed is responsible for overall shuttle processing at the Kennedy Space  Center under a multibillion-dollar contract, while EG&amp;G is responsible for  base operations, including security.  </P> <P> Malone initially said the cocaine was discovered by drug-sniffing dogs during a  routine sweep, but Harris said no dogs were involved.  </P> <P> "The security people don't want to say how it was found," Harris said.  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Euro-sceptics set test for Major TORY Euro-sceptics last night used the bill paving the way for enlargement of the European Community to test the government's commitment to clipping the wings of Brussels bureaucracy. Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire North and a former cabinet minister, urged Mr John Major to implement his 'Brixton manifesto'. He used Brixton because of the prime minister's association with the rundown inner-city area of London - and the manifesto was his recent article in The Economist newspaper underlining the importance of curbing centralism in the EC. Welcoming the prospect of several members of the European Free Trade Association becoming full members of the EC, Mr Biffen described them as being on the 'edge of Europe'. He suggested that their interests were likely to be aligned with Britain's. Mr Biffen looked to the government to ensure that this led to greater recognition of the 'diversity' of the member states of the EC and a departure from the centralisation of recent years. Mr Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, said the European Economic Area bill associated six Efta states - Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Sweden - with the EC and at least four were expected to become full members later. He forecast that the financial-services sector would be one of the main beneficiaries of the enlargement. The bill was given a second reading by 152 votes to nine. It later completed its remaining stages, gaining a third reading without a vote.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular weekly interview with Georgian State Council </F> Chairman Eduard Shevardnadze by correspondent Nato Oniani; place  and date not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] Batono Eduard, I believe when speaking  of the most significant issues of the past week, we have to  begin with the 26 May holiday [Georgia's Independence Day].  Georgia celebrated this holiday as befits a state and a  military parade was also held. We can recall heated arguments  just before 26 May. Some people expressed the opinion that  defeated troops should not hold a parade. However, it was not  merely a parade of defeated or victorious troops; it was a  celebration of the 26 May holiday with a military parade. The  parade was eventually held, as well as numerous other fetes  which you also attended. How necessary do you think it was to  celebrate this day in this way?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. Now that we have an  opportunity to analyze everything that occurred in the past days  pertaining to 26 May, I believe the authorities' decision to  hold a parade has proved to be right. One often encounters the  view that we do not have a sense of statehood, and we also hear  many other nihilistic remarks about our country, our state, our  independence, and so on. This sort of celebration was necessary  simply in order to demonstrate to the world not only that we  have a sense of statehood and realize the necessity to build our  statehood, but also the fact that appropriate structures and  attributes have already been created. This was necessary to  prove the above and in order that the people could see what had  already been done.    You are well aware that many opponents were categorically  opposed to holding the parade for understandable reasons. Some,  I suppose, intended to hold a grandiose antigovernment and  antistate rally, or, rather, rallies directed against the  authorities; naturally, this parade and other fetes would  frustrate their plans. They were probably afraid that the  rallies they had planned could lose their grandeur. Nothing  terrible has happened. The parade has been held. The people  have celebrated the day. The rallies were also held. Let the  people judge which was more significant.    The idea that defeated troops never hold parades is wrong  and  even harmful. The people, even defeated people, restore their  strength, build an army, and establish a police force, and the  authorities support the people in this great deed. All of this  is a guarantee of success in building a state. [passage omitted]    Just before the 26 May holiday, I signed a few documents,  later discussed by the Cabinet of Ministers, about speeding up  the process of privatizing state-owned enterprises. The  documents stipulate active participation in this process of the  enterprises' employees, including their managers. All  provisions will be given finishing touches. All this will be  published in the press, and the printing of vouchers for the  purchase of shares will be speeded up. The idea is that members  of labor collectives, their managers, and the corps of managers,  as well as each citizen of the republic, will become actual  proprietors. They will not be big owners, but each citizen will  have a definite share in the wealth created in the country over  the past decades. Provided the wealth expands, the citizen's  property will also become more significant.    I would also like to support an initiative launched by the  Georgian savings bank and its newly appointed president, Mr.  Chkhartishvili. He is a brilliant young man with a very good  way of thinking, and he has started his job very well. In  accordance with this initiative, every depositor -- and there  are many thousands of them -- will become a shareholder, in  effect one of the owners of the bank. Yesterday, I decided to  support a request to reduce the state's share, which is very big  and comprises dozen of billions [unit not specified], and the  sum will actually be distributed among the shareholders.  [passage omitted]    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, on 25 May up to 40 political and  social organizations signed a declaration of national accord and  unity. It was a document you called for at the meeting of the  board of the Union of Georgia's Citizens on your return from a  Moscow summit of the CIS countries on 16 April. The board  consented and the response was very good. Apart from its  symbolic significance of this, do you think there are any  prospects of real unity, as you said after the parade when you  quoted a verse by Galaktion [Galaktion Tabidze, a Georgian poet]  calling for unity?    [Shevardnadze] [passage omitted] I would say that this lays  a  foundation for future deeds. Some will join the movement,  others will probably dissociate themselves from it. However,  the movement for unity and integrity and the apprehension of  responsibilities for the state will take deeper roots among our  people and in the country generally.    Like many citizens of our country, I am categorically  opposed  to an unhealthy politicization of the community. However, I  will support politicization if it means that politics is  associated with the idea of statehood, with a concern for the  state, with tasks of building the state. In this respect, the  declaration is undoubtedly a step forward in the sense that it  fosters concern for the state and its building and helps unite  all forces.    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the topic of Abkhazia was in the air  last week. We know that a working team led by Lieutenant  General [Aleksandr] Sokolov arrived from Moscow to study issues  regarding the stationing of peacekeeping forces. Have any  practical steps been taken in this respect?    [Shevardnadze] I am still reluctant to speak of details.  However, it was a necessary and useful meeting. I am reluctant  to speak about any details because the UN Security Council  resolution on the issue is to be made public this week. The  resolution is to be passed this week. Thus far, the Security  Council has not passed a resolution consenting to the deployment  of peacekeeping forces and extending the role of UN observers  and their new mandate.    This issue, I mean a draft resolution, is also being  considered by the heads of CIS countries. The draft has been  distributed, and I have received my copy. That is natural,  because it was initiated at my request. The Russian president,  Mr. Yeltsin, has sent the draft to the heads of all states. As  far as I know, the first response is positive and an adequate  resolution may be passed.    In fact, almost everything is being prepared, everything is  done to secure the earliest possible beginning of a peacekeeping  operation. However, as I have already said, it will take a  certain time to make a political decision. It may take several  days or one or two weeks. After the decision is made, almost  everything will be ready for starting a stage-by-stage  peacekeeping operation. This is what we have recently been  considering in Tbilisi with Mr. Sokolov and others.    I would also like to say that people should not imagine that  the return of refugees to their homes will happen like this:  that one day all bridges will be opened and 250,000 or 300,000  people will return simultaneously. This is unbelievable. This  is impossible. An enormous amount of preparatory work will have  to be done. I will sign an edict in this connection later  today. The beginning of the process is approaching and a great  deal of preparatory work has to be done.    There is no doubt that the refugees will return to ravaged  and destroyed properties. Nothing has been sown there; nothing  has been looked after. One can say, if you will, that life will  have to start from the very beginning. How can this be  accomplished? What resources are available in the country? Who  will help us? How can we help each family and each refugee?  All these questions are causing great concern. On their  return, the refugees should be given a minimum of essentials  required for their existence and work -- I mean bread, fuel,  building materials, and fundamental things to enable a person to  come back and start work. We will have to do all this.    [Oniani] Thank you. A tragic event occurred in Ingushetia  last week: eight Georgian specialists were killed, or rather  slaughtered. In addition, this was done in the territory of the  people with whom Georgia has always had warm, good, and really  neighborly and friendly relations. Do you think this crime had  a political aim? I realize that it is difficult to speak of  this until the investigation is completed.    [Shevardnadze] I would say that we have had an exceptionally  friendly and fraternal relationship with the president of  Ingushetia and the Ingush people, like many other peoples, for  instance, the peoples of Dagestan or North Ossetia. Although  our relations with North Ossetia have lately become complicated,  we used to have really magnificent relations. Well, this is the  truth with almost all peoples. However, our relations with the  Ingush people have been remarkable for decades and even for  centuries.    I have to tell you that the Ingushs have intense feelings  about the tragedy similar to those we experience here in  Georgia. Some sequences have been shown on our television. It  goes without saying, first of all, that I would like to express  my sympathy and condolences to the families of the deceased.  The road that is being built should by all means be built, and  it will be named after them. The bridge linking the two peoples  will undoubtedly be linked with their names.    Whoever committed this savage act naturally intended to ruin  Georgia's relations with someone, to ruin Ingushetia's relations  with someone, to ruin Ingush-Georgian relations. Perhaps they  intended to obstruct the process of improving Georgian-Ossetian  relations, or to hinder the ongoing development of contacts with  Dagestan, North Ossetia, and other republics -- and with Russia  in general. This was a provocative plan. However, I would like  to reiterate that whoever the executioners were, whichever  nation they represented, terrorists remain terrorists. We will  never identify them with the people in general, and I am  convinced that this event will exert no influence on our  friendship with the Ingush people and with other peoples, and we  will do our best to build new relations with the peoples of  Caucasia, especially North Caucasia, on the basis of what is  called the best age-old traditions of friendship and fraternity.    [Oniani] Finally, Batono Eduard, in your address dedicated  to 26 May -- which was entitled: We will build a new independent  democratic Georgia -- you said: I would not say that the world  has been currently divided into spheres of influence between  superpowers, the giants of East and West. However, one thing is  clear, that when the sun shines, a shadow is cast somewhere on  the earth. This is definitely natural for every region. How  about Georgia?    [Shevardnadze] This will undoubtedly lead us to the question  of where the sun rises. This is a figure of speech, of course.  In the language of politicians, this means a balance of  interests. The share of various countries in the balance of  interests differs. Its volume and its extent differ.    Russia is not the only country with which Georgia has a  balance of interests. We have a balance of interests with other  countries too. Turkey has interests in our country, and we have  interests in Turkey. The same is true of Iran, of other  neighbors, and of other countries, say the West, say the United  States of America and so on. Since Russia has always been  considered the most interested party, I can say that Russia  really has definite interests in Georgia. I do not conceal  this, neither does President Yeltsin. He has said so. Nor do we  conceal that Georgia has even more interests in Russia. Thus, a  shadow falls not only in Georgia but also in Russia. The same  can be said about other countries.    We should speak less about spheres of influence and more  about a balance of interests, a proportionateness of interests,  and a compatibility of interests with processes taking place in  the world. Thus, when speaking about spheres of interests we  have to consider that this sounds different today. This is not  a post-World War II or a post-World War I period; nor is it a  situation similar to that in past centuries, when this was an  established practice. Nowadays, the approach is a little  different.    [Oniani] Thank you very much.</p>

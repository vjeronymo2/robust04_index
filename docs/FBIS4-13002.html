			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 14, IRNA -- Iran's embassy in Ankara  on Thursday denounced the "baseless" remarks made by Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres in Turkey against Iran. In a  statement, the embassy said that it regretted that such baseless  and meaningless statements were made in Iran's neighbouring  state of Turkey.    Peres who is visiting Turkey, in his speech wished the laic  government of Turkey would overcome the Islamic revolution of  Iran.    The embassy statement stressed that world Muslims especially  Muslims of Turkey know very well the "terrorist and unreliable"  nature of the Zionist regime. Terrorist acts and instability in  the Middle East began when imperialism implanted the Qods  [Jerusalem] occupying regime in the heart of Muslim states, it  said, adding all terrorist-motivated killings originated from  the Zionist entity.    The Iranian Embassy said that Zionist officials by making  such remarks could never mar the solid and brotherly relations  between Iran and Turkey.</p>

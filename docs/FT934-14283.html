			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / The Week Ahead Results due ON MONDAY, Farnell Electronics, the Harrogate-based electronic components and equipment manufacturer and distributor, is expected to report interim pre-tax profits of about Pounds 18.5m, against Pounds 15.4m before exceptionals a year ago. The results will be the first for Mr Howard Poulson, Farnell's new chief executive, who arrived in August from Volex. SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American healthcare group, reports third-quarter profits on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of about Pounds 300m, up 12 per cent on the Pounds 267m of the same period last year. The results will reflect the sale of consumer products to Sara Lee and restructuring charges. Underlying pharmaceuticals growth is expected at between 8 and 10 per cent, but analysts will be looking at the impact of reforms in Italy and Germany. Also on Tuesday, Wolseley, the heating and plumbing distributor, is expected to report preliminary pre-tax profits of about Pounds 110m for the year to end July 31, up from Pounds 91.3m last year - a figure which surprised analysts who had been expecting Pounds 70m. Smiths Industries, the aerospace and specialist engineering group, is likely on Wednesday to report annual profits only marginally increased from last year's total of Pounds 102m. Once again, delays in defence procurement and reductions in civilian aircraft programmes will be partly offset by the strength of the group's medical products side. Albert Fisher, the food processing and distribution group, is expected on Thursday to report a drop in pre-tax profits to Pounds 48m (Pounds 52m) in the year to August. Mr Stephen Walls replaced the group's founder, Mr Tony Millar, as chairman last year after a traumatic year for the former stock market favourite.

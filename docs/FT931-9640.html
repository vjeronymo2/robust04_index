			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / Letter: US punitive damages legally complex, but fair in concept Sir, The US system of punitive damages is a complex legal maze and is further convoluted by differences which exist throughout the 50 states. However, the fundamental concept is simple and fair. The system provides a straightforward procedure wherein an inanimate, but irresponsible, corporation's behaviour can be addressed by punishing it to a degree commensurate with its irresponsibility and proportional to the sufferings produced. Hopefully, such punishment will discourage the reoccurrence of such behaviour. In addition to the points Robert Rice made in his article, 'The high cost of damaged goods' (February 9), he should also point out other important issues of US product safety and liability law. First, warranty and strict liability are quite distinct from negligence in that corporate behaviour becomes the key question of negligence. Second, throughout the US, punitive damages are on average four to eight times compensatory damages and there are in fact very few large punitive damage settlements and very few where this ratio becomes skewed. Also, punitive damages are not insurable. Third, many unreasonable punitive damage awards by juries have been immediately reduced by presiding judges or later on appeal. Perhaps most important is the cultural differences reflected in our laws. One example is the concept of foreseeable (although unintended) use of a product. If you manufacture screwdrivers you should ensure their safe use and function as pry bars. If you don't, you can be held liable for injury for such a foreseeable use. However, with equal importance to the issues of product liability, negligence, and other legal nuances, European managers contemplating or now doing business in the US should also be aware that many new laws have been enacted specifically to address corporate and managerial behaviour concerning the environment and employee safety. Specific penalties for endangering and injuring employees have resulted in incarceration and substantial fines to corporate managers and officers. Yes, it is a dangerous world out there.

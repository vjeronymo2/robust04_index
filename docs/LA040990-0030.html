			<p><P> April 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> ROVA QUARTET CAPABLE ON SAX  </P> <P> The cutting-edge group known as the ROVA Saxophone Quartet (its acronym uses  the initials of the founding members) was in town Saturday for a concert at the  Southern California Institute of Architecture in Santa Monica.  </P> <P> The 12-year-old unit resembles the World Saxophone Quartet only in the absence  of a rhythm section.  </P> <P> ROVA is well rehearsed, it plays in tune, and it aims at a pan-musical  avant-garde experience.  </P> <P> In the course of the evening there was a continual interchange between unison  and harmony, tonality and atonality, counterpoint and polyphony, rhythmic  pulses and timelessness. It also deals with strict composition and total  freedom, which could be easily distinguished in Steve Lacy's brilliantly  structured "Precipitation Suite," but in Henry Threadgill's "Background" the  dividing line was hard to detect. ROVA tells you everything you wanted to know  about the sax but were afraid to ask.  </P> <P> Original works within the group were composed by baritone saxophonist John  Raskin, tenor sax soloist Larry Ochs (who doubled on soprano sax) and the  newest member, altoist Steve Adams. Bruce Ackley on soprano sax contributed  some of the most emotionally moving solos.  </P> <P> At times energy tended to replace form, and intensity took precedence over  content. At one point a table was brought on stage bearing gadgets: a toy  trumpet, balls and flags, used as hand signals during a hysterical piece. This  exercise in pretension tipped over the border between the sublime to the  ridiculous; such gimmicks are unfunny and uncalled for.  </P> <P> A strange interlude had the men playing one staccato chord every five seconds.  During the intervening silences a dog outside the hall barked in what seemed  like perfect time. This was truly an outstanding example of aleatory music.  LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

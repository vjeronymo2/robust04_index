Mikhail Lapshin, leader of the Agrarian Party of Russia,  assures, for example, that the party will participate in the  elaboration of a memorandum of civil peace but will raise a lot  of questions. In particular, about the revival of the Russian  countryside and will see to it in every way that "accord would  not lead to a suppression of part of society".    Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia,  said he visualises the way to civil accord only in the  attainment of agreement between the two branches of power --  executive and legislative -- and not in some single document,  however complete it is and whatever the number of parties  signing it.    TRUD comments on Thursday's [17 March] remarks made by Prime  Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin at the Federation council session,  quoting him as saying that "we do not need a state of emergency  in the economy" which is fully controlled by both the president  of Russia and the government.    The newspaper's opinion is that if the measures mentioned by  the Russian premier are implemented (namely, a solution to  defaults of payments, a selective support of enterprises,  restructuring, etc.) "the country will stand real chances to get  out of the crisis."    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA on the problem of non-payments.    Vladimir Chumakov, general director of the Yugtransgaz  state-run enterprise, states that "defaults of payments are our  sore point now. More than 60 per cent of the amount of sold gas  has not been paid for."    Such a financial reality, Chumakov said, "deforms our  economic, technical and social policies". In order to remove  the cause of the economic disorganisation, he pleads the need to  revise, first of all, the taxation policy and to determine a  reform policy in a clear-cut manner "so that people and  enterprises would know the direction we proceed along."    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA singles out a report that Boris Shurinov,  vice- president of the UFOlogy union, has accused a number of  servicemen from the Russian Defence Ministry of "clandestine  sales" of information on the UFO problem from secret archives to  the Americans. Next week the newspaper promises to give details  of the russian "UFO-gate".    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (Red Star) on Pavel Grachev-William Perry  meeting:    "A fundamentally new relationship -- businesslike, partner's  and mutually respectful -- is taking shape between the two great  powers. They are imbued not with chill but with business  efficiency which is undoubtedly devoid of certain original  enthusiasm which marked the turn of the decade".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA carries an interview with Russia's  former prosecutor-general Aleksey Kazannik who asserts that "the  incumbent authorities lack moral principles" and that "selfish  interests are predominating among them".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA on the start of overt confrontation  between Presidents Yuriy Meshkov of the Crimea and President  Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, who cancelled Meshkov's decree about  an autonomy referendum.    "This balancing on the verge of a precipice may also easily  lead to an aggravation of Russo-Ukrainian relations and turn the  Crimea from an increasingly costly health resort into a hotbed  of civil war".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Gennadiy  Voronin, deputy chairman of the Russian state committee for the  defence industry, who warns that Russia runs the risk of "losing  the status of great power" and emphasises that "the duty of the  Russian state is to save its navy".    PRAVDA gives prominence to the text of an address to the  citizens of Russia by the leaders of the left-centre opposition  who call on people to unite in order to "prevent a final breakup  of historical Russia and the disruption of cultural, economic  and political relationships that took shape for centuries  between its equal peoples".</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Survey of Greece (11): Prizeworthy taste of success - Anne Counsell discusses the quiet revolution in the wine industry GEORGE Skouras predicts a good year for his Megas Oenos wines. He has already had a head start; the 1990 Megas Oenos carried off first prize in the category of full-bodied, expensive reds at the Wine America exposition in New York and his entire production for 1993 has been pre-sold. Not bad for a small producer of little known Greek wines, but his success story is part of a bigger, but quiet revolution - the emergence of good quality Greek wines produced by discerning winemakers experimenting with indigenous and international grape varieties. Nothing taints the palate or the reputation of Greek wines more than the lingering aftertaste of a bad retsina. Unfortunately, the bitter taste of the pine resin, originally added to preserve a mediocre wine or camouflage a poor one, has become synonomous with Greek wines in general. Mr Skouras and a small band of winemakers are improving this image by an emphasis on quality and consistency and by reviving interest in traditional vineyard areas. The Nemea region in the Peloponnese illustrates the range of production techniques and the diverse qualities of Greek wines. Vineyards hug the hillsides and occupy almost all the available land in the fertile Nemea valley, a basin area encircled by craggy outcrops of rock. There is an air of order and purpose in the valley. Seemingly endless rows of vines grow on neatly aligned supports to achieve optimum growth. The Agioritiko red grape is grown in Nemea under a controlled 'appellation of origin' and produces a dry wine with a rich bouquet and velvety taste, not dissimilar to Cabernet Sauvignon. Most of the leading producers offer a Nemea variety, many aged in oak barrels to improve body and aroma, in their portfolio of regional labels. The Nemea area embraces a range of production and marketing methods; from small grape growers with a couple of hectares to Ktemata (estates) with their own wineries and bottling plants. The region produces about 20,000 tonnes of wines a year from an area of just over 1,000 hectares. There are 40 wine producers and about twice as many small grape growers who sell their harvest to the wineries at a producer price of Dr80 a kilogramme. A gleaming new co-operative winery built with the aid of EC funds occupies a prime site in the centre of the valley. It is here that many small growers bring their harvest, which is then processed and blended for bulk export and bottling in Italy. Even at this lower end of the market, efforts are being made to achieve consistency and to improve standards. Other growers sell their grapes to the large producers or to independent wineries such as that owned by Mr Skouras. In return for paying a higher price to the growers, they maintain a watchful eye on vineyard practices. George Papaiannou and his father Athanasious cultivate an area of 30 hectares in the valley and their family winery produces between 10 and 15,000 cases a year with a range of eight labels. The Hellenic Export Promotion Organisation has awarded the elder Mr Papaiannou prizes for vine growing and cultivation of experimental varieties. However, the Papaiannous are purists. They do not blend grape varieties, and are insistent that meritocracy for indigenous grapes is the way forward. Local connections are reflected in the labels, one of which depicts the lion slain by Hercules at Nemea. Their winery exemplifies the efforts being made by small and medium-sized producers towards a consistent, better quality wine. It is also an illustration of the marketing and distribution difficulties which beset many Greek industries and which have hampered the effective promotion of wines. Mr Papaiannou complains about the lack of good export agents, as many are particular about price and less so about quality. 'This is bad for the image of Greek wines abroad,' he says. Mr Skouras, however, has had more success, largely because he has not relied on the vagaries of the local agent system. Bottles in hand, Mr Skouras sought out the reputable restaurants and cavas, selling the wines one by one on merit. Slowly he established a list of clients and won customer loyalty through consistent supplies and personal services. He also gave his Cambello table wines a high profile. The Cambello red, white and rose' wines feature in information leaflets for visitors to the Nauplia area. Maps, useful telephone numbers and descriptions of local sites are outlined in five European languages. Mr Skoures has also managed to penetrate the American market through personal contacts with a wine importing and distribution enterprise in Chicago. However, many of the independent producers have neither the contacts nor the energy of Mr Skouras and have to rely on the more haphazard agent system. For this reason, it is mainly the large producers who have been successful in securing export outlets. Boutari, the market leader, has outlets in Belgium, Germany, Denmark, Holland, the US, UK and Japan. It produces more than 25m bottles a year, of which 20 per cent are destined for export markets. With its purchase of the Andrew P Cambas company in 1991, Boutari now commands 29 per cent of the local market and has been a leader in the rennaisance of Greek wine making by drawing on its presence in many of Greece's long-established wine-producing regions. The Boutari empire stretches from Macedonia in the north to the island of Santorini, and its Classic labels use the indigenous grapes of each region. Much of the recent focus on improved quality has been initiated by larger companies seeking to expand their export outlets in an increasingly competitive market. Wines from France and Italy jostle for shelf space in supermarkets and off licences as an ever-increasing range from the New World and emerging producers enter the international market. This realisation has woken up Greek producers. Constrained by the terrain which precludes a huge increase in output, producers have begun to focus on the virtues and potential of indigenous grape varieties.</p>

			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> L.A. AREA NOW BATTLING WITH NEW PEST -- THE MEXFLY  </P> <P> County supervisors Tuesday grudgingly extended an emergency proclamation to  cover pesticide spraying to eradicate a new pest, the Mexican fruit fly.  </P> <P> The action came only after board members complained bitterly about the state's  lengthy battle against the Mediterranean fruit fly.  </P> <P> Joining the supervisors in condemning the state were city officials from  infested neighborhoods in the southeastern part of the county. They complained  about the state's plans to spray their communities every other week into June.  </P> <P> Supervisor Ed Edelman chided agriculture officials Tuesday for failing to stick  to a May 9 deadline to end the spraying against the Medfly. And Supervisor Pete  Schabarum griped about continued use of El Monte Airport, in his district, as  the base for the malathion-spewing helicopters.  </P> <P> "You announced that May 9 was going to be the last date for malathion spraying,  and that has already slipped," Schabarum told state Department of Food and  Agriculture officials. "So you don't mind if I have a little bit of reservation  about the genuineness of your representation."  </P> <P> Edelman, questioning the effectiveness of the 10-month aerial attack on the  Medfly, said: "I am wondering if it makes sense to embark on the same kind of  program for the Mexican fruit fly. If it hasn't worked as effectively in  ridding Southern California of one bug, how is it going to work in ridding the  county of this other bug?"  </P> <P> Supervisors, nonetheless, approved the emergency proclamation, which shields  the county from liability in connection with the eradication program.  </P> <P> Don Henry of the state agriculture department assured Schabarum that the  helicopters will stop using El Monte Airport after tonight.  </P></p>

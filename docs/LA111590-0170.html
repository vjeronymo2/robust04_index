			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOARING AIRPORT RENTS SQUEEZE OUT SMALL PLANES;  </P> <P> AVIATION: PROPELLER AIRCRAFT ARE BEING REPLACED BY COMPANY JETS IN AN  EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS IN WHICH ONLY THE ECONOMICALLY FIT SURVIVE.  </P> <P> On the afternoon of Dec. 7, 1941, hours after Japanese bombers struck Pearl  Harbor, U.S. Army officers drove up to Van Nuys Airport and commandeered the  dirt-strip airfield for the war effort.  </P> <P> In less than a month, the sleepy country airport was transformed into a  bustling military complex.  </P> <P> The changes taking place these days at the central San Fernando Valley airfield  are occurring more slowly than those rushed through 49 years ago by the Air  Corps.  </P> <P> But many in the aviation community think that over time, they will be as  dramatic.  </P> <P> Ever since the Air Force moved out after the war, Van Nuys Airport has served  as a training ground and playground for tens of thousands of private pilots. As  a result, the Los Angeles city-owned facility has long been the world's busiest  general aviation field and is the seventh-busiest airport in the nation,  although it has no scheduled commercial air service.  </P> <P> Trends suggest that a decade from now the airport will be as much an office  complex as an aviation facility. And although it might still lead the nation in  takeoffs and landings 10 years from now, weekend pleasure fliers with their  Cessnas and Pipers will have been largely replaced by private jets.  </P> <P> Both trends began about a decade ago and homeowners, pleasure pilots and  airport officials disagree over whether airport managers should allow the  trends to continue or seek to reverse them.  </P> <P> In 1979, there were 1,333 piston-engine planes at Van Nuys Airport; today there  are only 711.  </P> <P> During the same 11 years, the number of jets based at the airport grew from 18  to 93.  </P> <P> The jets seem to be winning out for scarce space at the airport through a  Darwinian process in which only the economically fittest survive.  </P> <P> The airport does not rent space directly to airplane owners. Instead, it rents  land to aircraft-related businesses and leaves it largely up to them whether  they will cater to jets or piston craft.  </P> <P> Business operators say that renting and servicing jets, and leasing space for  jets, which are favored by corporate executives and high rollers who don't  blink at spending thousands of dollars an hour to get somewhere in a hurry and  are willing to pay higher rates, is far more profitable than doing business  with owners of piston craft.  </P> <P> The list of regular jet users at Van Nuys Airport includes many of Southern  California's biggest employers -- Litton Industries, Hughes Aircraft, General  Motors, Great Western Savings. Also regularly appearing on the airport's flight  log are many of the Southland's movers and shakers: sports and publishing mogul  Jack Kent Cooke, Chatsworth computer chip maker Tandon Jawahar and former  President Ronald Reagan.  </P> <P> Airport officials agree that pitting jets against pistons sometimes seems to be  an unfair contest, particularly since pleasure fliers who use piston engines  have already been buffeted during the 1980s by sharply higher insurance and  maintenance costs.  </P> <P> But the officials nonetheless characterize the advances made by jets as being  as natural as the triumph of weeds over flowers in an untended garden.  </P> <P> "As a government agency, we cannot give anything away," said airport Manager  Charles Zeman. "We have to get fair market value for the land we rent out to  fixed-base operators."  </P> <P> Under contracts with tenants, the airport raises its rent every five years.  Last February, the cost per acre was increased to $14,000 per year, up 32% from  the $10,600 set in 1985.  </P> <P> That has resulted in the fixed-base operators charging an average tie-down rate  of $120 a month for a single-engine plane at Van Nuys Airport compared to $72 a  month for Santa Monica Municipal Airport and $76 a month for Whiteman Airport  in Pacoima. Zeman said the higher rate at Van Nuys "sounds a lot more  reasonable when you compare the facilities here with other airports," citing  what he said were superior repair and maintenance facilities, firefighting  apparatus and security patrols.  </P> <P> But Lee Kanon Alpert, chairman of the Van Nuys Airport Citizens Advisory  Council, said that the small planes are leaving for other fields because  airport officials "have jacked up the rents so high that the cost of a tie-down  has gone through the roof."  </P> <P> He advocates a two-tiered rental system in which operators that rent to owners  of piston-engine planes would pay less rent than those that serve jet owners.  </P> <P> "That way you could serve the entire aviation community and still keep adequate  revenue coming in," Alpert said. "But I would be surprised if the Department of  Airports went for that because everything they do seems oriented to maximizing  income."  </P> <P> Airport officials say that a two-tiered plan would be difficult to administer,  since many of the airport operators service both jets and piston-engine planes.  </P> <P> The same economic forces that are bringing in more jets are bringing about the  transformation of much of the 735-acre airport into an office and hotel  complex.  </P> <P> The Board of Airport Commissioners, which runs the city's airports, is pushing  for Van Nuys Airport to generate more income in anticipation of the December,  1992, expiration of long-term contracts that benefit commercial airlines. Those  contracts obligate the city to use revenue in excess of airport operating costs  to lower landing fees at Los Angeles International and Ontario airports.  </P> <P> Once those contracts expire, however, airport revenue in excess of costs could  be used to help pay for general city operations.  </P> <P> "I'm hearing from some council members, including more than one from the  valley, who want to see us make a profit on airports as soon as we can," said  airport Commissioner Samuel Greenberg. He declined to identify which council  members he was referring to.  </P> <P> Throughout the 1980s, the department has allowed small parcels of land on the  airport's perimeter to be leased for mostly single-building commercial  developments.  </P> <P> But in recent years, the pace of commercial development has accelerated.  </P> <P> In April, a consultant recommended that a massive office complex be developed  at the former Air National Guard site on Balboa Boulevard. A report said the 1  million square feet of office space would generate $4.7 million a year in lease  income, more than half the airport's $8.2 million in revenue during the fiscal  year that ended June 30.  </P> <P> The board shelved the plan without comment after homeowners protested that it  would produce massive traffic tie-ups on Balboa and Roscoe boulevards. Further,  aviation enthusiasts complained because only 16 acres of the base's 94 acres in  the airport's northwest corner would be set aside for parking and servicing  airplanes.  </P> <P> The department staff is expected to make a new recommendation for the site in  about six months.  </P> <P> While that site's future remains clouded, the commission has tentatively  approved a 123,000-square-foot mixed-use development on Valjean Avenue north of  the Van Nuys Airtel Plaza Hotel, and has reacted favorably to another proposed  project of about the same size on Hayvenhurst Avenue.  </P> <P> Airport staff members are negotiating with both developers.  </P> <P> Also under consideration are two competing proposals for a 38-acre site on  Woodley Avenue being vacated by Volpar Aircraft Corp. Each plan contains more  than 700,000 square feet of office space and about one-fourth that much for  hangars.  </P> <P> If all the suggested plans are allowed to go through, Zeman predicted, the  airport could produce a profit for the city of about $8 million a year.  </P> <P> "These development plans are ridiculous," said Don Schultz, president of the  Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. and founder of the anti-noise group Ban Airport  Noise.  </P> <P> "They are way too intensive for our area. Getting in and out on Woodley is  tough already, and these would make it all but impossible."  </P> <P> He said the homeowner group does not object to mixed-use development. "But we  oppose the massive size of these plans," he said.  </P> <P> Ultimately, the fate of proposed large-scale developments on airport property  is likely to rest with the council, which has given no public indication of how  it feels about generating revenue from the airport.  </P> <P> In 1987, under homeowner pressure, the council rezoned the airport's 735 acres  to require that a conditional-use permit be obtained for any development larger  than 10,000 square feet. All such permits can be appealed to the council.  </P> <P> Zeman acknowledged that the council might pull the airport commission up short  in its move to develop the airport property with high-yield office projects.  </P> <P> "It remains to be seen how this will play itself out," he said. "I'm sure that  over time we will evolve more into a revenue-generating facility, but I can't  predict how soon that will happen or to what extent."  </P></p>

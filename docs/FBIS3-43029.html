			<p>Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Text of "Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties </F> in Russian Federation"; first paragraph is italic SELEKTSIYA I  SEMENOVODSTVO introduction]    [Text] We are presenting  for your attention the "Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant  Varieties in Russian Federation," which has been approved by the  Ministry of Agriculture. It was developed with consideration for  the concept of the draft of the ``Law Regarding Selection  Improvements Whose Adoption Is Eagerly Awaited by Breeders.'' In  view of the fact that some genera and species of agricultural  crops will not be subject to the Law for a certain period, the  Statute published here will regulate relations arising during  the creation and use of new varieties of these crops.  <H3>  Statute Regarding State Testing of Plant Varieties in the  Russian Federation </H3>   This Statute specifies the procedure for government testing  of plant varieties for the purpose of scientifically  substantiated formation of the variety resources of the Russian  Federation and regulates relations arising in connection with  the creation and use of new varieties.    The Statute is in effect until the passage and effective  date  of the Russian Federation Law Regarding Selection Improvements.  <H5>  I. General Provisions </H5>   1.1. Government tests of new varieties, hybrids, and lines  of  agricultural crops and other cultivated plants and silkworm  breeds and hybrids (henceforth referred to as varieties) are  conducted by the All-Russian State Commission on Agricultural  Crop Variety Testing (henceforth referred to as the  Gossortkomissiya) through the following:     -  republic, kray, and oblast inspectors to test varieties of  agricultural crops (henceforth referred to as inspectors);    -  government variety-testing stations (henceforth referred to  as  gossortstantsii);    -  government variety-testing sections located on an independent  balance sheet or organizational variety-testing sections on a  contractual basis in agricultural enterprises under different  forms of ownership (henceforth referred to as gossortouchastki);    -  the All-Russia Center for Quality Evaluation of Agricultural  Crop Varieties [VTsOKS];    -  regional chemical technology laboratories (henceforth  referred  to as laboratories);    -  other organizations on a contractual basis.       1.2. The Gossortkomissiya, in accordance with this Statute,  will assume the examination of variety applications, conduct an  expert examination of them and test the varieties, manage the  State Register of Varieties Authorized for Use in Production in  the Corresponding Region of the Russian Federation (henceforth  referred to as the State Register), issue certificates and  authorship certificates, publish rules clarifying the use of  this Statute and the government's variety-testing method,  publish official information, and perform other functions in  accordance with the applicable statutes.    1.3. Inclusion of a variety in the State Register grants the  right to reproduce, import, and sell seeds and plant material of  a variety in territories of the republics, krays, and oblasts of  a respective region. Crops of these varieties are subjected to  testing, and variety documents are issued for them.    Reproduction of seeds and plant material of a variety for  purposes of their export beyond the confines of its respective  region does not require inclusion of the variety in the State  Register for the given region.    1.4. For a variety included in the State Register, the  Gossortkomissiya issues a certificate to the applicant and an  authorship certificate to the developer.    1.5. State testing of plant varieties is financed with the  resources of the republic budget of the Russian Federation.  <H5>  II. The State Register </H5>   2.1. The State Register includes varieties permitted for use  during that year in the respective region of the Russian  Federation (Appendix).    2.2. In the case of crops on the list specified by the  Gossortkomissiya, inclusion of varieties in the State Register  is based on government tests; in the case of all other crops,  inclusion is based on expert evaluations or studies conducted by  the applicant.    Varieties regionalized in the Russian Federation as of the  approval date of this Statute are included in the State Register  de facto.    2.3. The following varieties are excluded from the State  Register of Varieties:  varieties that have lost their agricultural value, homogeneity,  or stability;  seeds (plant material) that are not in demand and have not been  used in the production of the respective region for the past 5  years.    2.4. When the reasons prompting exclusion of a variety from  the State Register have been eliminated, the originator has the  right to send the Gossortkomissiya a petition requesting that  the variety be reinstated in the State Register after the  appropriate tests.    2.5. Revisions in the State Register and lists of the  following are approved by the Russian Federation Ministry of  Agriculture upon the recommendation of the Gossortkomissiya:     -  varieties of hardy wheat;    -  varieties of grain, cereal, and leguminous crops that are  valuable from a quality standpoint;    -  varieties of brewing barley;    -  high-oil varieties of sunflower;    -  erucic acid-free and low-glucosinolate varieties of rape and  summer rape.   <H5>    III. The Certificate </H5>   3.1. The certificate certifies the originator of the variety  and grants him the right to conclude agreements to produce the  seeds (plant material) and sell them, as well as to otherwise  introduce the variety into economic circulation in accordance  with the State Register.    In the event that a certificate for a variety is issued to  several applicants who have jointly created the variety, the  relationships regarding use of the variety in production is  regulated by an agreement among them.    3.2. A certificate shall remain in effect for 20 years from  the date of its issue. In the case of grapes and decorative and  fruit tree varieties, including their rootstock, this period  shall constitute 25 years.    3.3. The holder of a certificate is obliged to maintain the  variety so as to preserve the traits specified in the  description of the variety on the priority date, its  homogeneity, and its stability and is, upon the request of the  Gossortkomissiya, obliged to send them at his own expense seeds  of the variety for check tests and to permit on-site inspections  when necessary.  <H5>  IV. The Authorship Certificate </H5>   4.1. The authorship certificate certifies the authorship of  a  variety and priority and grants the developer the right to  receive authorship royalties from the holder of the certificate  based on an agreement with him for as long as funds are received  as a result of use of the variety in production.    The royalties to a team of developers are distributed in  proportion to the extent of each developer's participation in  creation of the variety.    4.2. The physical individual whose creative labor has either  created or discovered a variety may be the developer of that  variety. Disputes regarding authorship are resolved in a  judicial procedure.    4.3. The period for which an authorship certificate remains  in effect is unlimited.  <H5>  V. Handling of an Application </H5>   5.1. The breeder submits an application for inclusion of the  variety in the State Register and issuance of a certificate and  authorship certificate to the Gossortkomissiya. In the case of a  variety created while the breeder is performing his job or job  duties, the application is submitted by the originating  institution.    5.2.

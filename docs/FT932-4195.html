			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Hambros fall curbed by insurance float HAMBROS, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday reported a 12.5 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits as contributions from direct investments dropped and losses from retail financial services increased. Profits in the year ended March 31 fell from Pounds 74.3m to Pounds 65m. The shares fell 5p to 332p on a day the market rallied. Investment profits fell from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 12.5m after what the bank described as a lack of selling opportunities in a subdued market. Most of the profits were generated from the flotation of Hambro Insurance Services. Losses from retail financial services increased from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 12.2m. This was mainly because of the Hambro Countrywide estate agency chain which incurred a loss in its year to December 31. The bank has subsequently said that Hambro Countrywide had returned to profit. Central finance and overhead costs increased from Pounds 16.8m to Pounds 18.6m mainly because of the higher interest payments on the Pounds 54m increase in the bank's medium-term loan capital. Profits from banking remained broadly static at Pounds 73.8m (Pounds 73.4m). Provisions for bad debts were higher at Pounds 24m (Pounds 13m), representing 1.2 per cent of lending assets. Profits from the insurance services rose from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 9.5m after the flotation of Hambro Insurance services in which the bank has a 54.1 per cent stake. Fully diluted earnings per share fell to 20.8p (25.4p). The recommended final dividend is increased to 9.8p (9.6p) making an increased total of 14p (13.8p). COMMENT The bank's flotation of Hambro Insurance Services could not have come at a better time given the disappointing result from investments in the first half. Banking continues to perform adequately, even if its return on capital slipped from 21 per cent to 19 per cent because of provisions for bad debts. The year is already looking better with Hambro Countrywide back in the black and the bank confidently predicting a recovery in its main markets. But the test for Hambros will be what it can do with its earnings per share which have shown no real growth for the past five years. That was mainly due to the problems associated with retail financial services. With those at an end shareholders will be expecting better things next year.</p>

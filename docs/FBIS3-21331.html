After their  shanties and dugouts were made into parks and other centers, the  shanty dwellers took the same life to which they have become  accustomed over the years to other parts of the city and made  themselves new shanties.    Even those who were installed in new housing by the  government in newly established towns migrated to other  locations after a time because they were not familiar with urban  and apartment life.    Experts say this serious and deeply rooted social problem  cannot be solved by building parks and libraries on top of the  shanty towns and dugouts. It needs years of cultural and social  work to uproot the thinking and lifestyle of living in shanties  and dugouts, with all its characteristics.    The inattention of officials to doing fundamental work to  change the culture of the society of dugout and shanty dwellers,  especially the youth, has spread various forms of criminal  behavior, which were once confined to the shanty areas to other  parts of the capital. The young generation of shanty dwellers is  illiterate and lacks any kind of skill. Now they do not know how  to do anything but collect garbage, scavenge, steal from homes,  snatch purses, steal automobiles, buy and sell narcotics, prowl  neighborhoods, and annoy people. In reality, the dugouts and  shantytowns can be called societies for training young criminals.    After driving out the shanty dwellers and destroying their  huts, they have now created the same conditions that existed  before in different parts of the city, and naturally they are  more difficult to control than before.    Experts believe that before turning these areas into parks,  recreational centers and other things, officials should have  changed the social and training makeup of the shantytowns  through the necessary instruction, by operating short-term  literacy programs and by teaching the young people some kind of  specialization and ability. For example, after the women on  Jamshid Street in the Qazvin gate area were driven out, they  scattered to other parts of the city and continued living in the  same way.    A problem the dugout dwellers faced immediately after their  neighborhoods were destroyed was the loss of their identity and  lack of familiarity with normal urban life. For this reason,  after they were driven from their shantytowns, they tried to  create the same atmosphere and conditions in other parts of the  city. The government transferred some of the shanty dwellers to  cities built during these years, but after a short time these  families realized that the culture of shanty dwelling is not  compatible with the culture of living in these kinds of places  and they gradually moved away from urban life and returned to  their former lives.    In other words, the shanty dwellers were merely displaced,  and they took their lifestyle with them wherever they went. The  experts worry that dealing precipitously and without study with  the issue of life in dugouts and shanties in the early years of  the revolution is gradually bringing the failures of the past  back to the city. One of the most sensitive areas is the Jamshid  area, where the women of Qel'eh, formerly Shahr-e No, live. In  recent years famous dugouts in Tehran such as Zanburak Khuneh,  Haluqanbar, Qasem Shokry, 'Arabha, Haj Masha'allah, Majalleh-ye  Jamshid, Baghchal, Seyyed Darvish, Halab Shahr, and Nafari were  destroyed without the necessary study of their social, family  and cultural situation and their employment. Yet before settling  the residents of these dugouts in other places, it was necessary  first to think about the state of their education, their  health-care situation, and most important of all, their moral,  ethical, and psychological problems. The youth and adolescents  in the shantytowns are either illiterate or only partially  literate. Their only recreation is theft, harassment, and buying  and selling narcotics.    Sociologists believe that destroying dugouts and shantytowns  destroys the physical makeup and the identity of the  neighborhoods, and on the other hand, by scattering the  shantytowns it disrupts the web of social relations. Officials  are now seeing the return of some shanty dwellers to some of  these areas, and this in itself shows the strength of the  structural roots in the phenomenon of shanty towns. In some  districts not only have the shantytowns not been uprooted, but  other shanty towns have also been created.    There are now 50,000 people living in shantytowns scattered  throughout the capital.</p>

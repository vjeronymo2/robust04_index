			<p>Language: <F P=105> Thai </F> Article Type:CSO     [Excerpt] [Passage omitted] Because of the report of  ``acid rain'' in Samut Prakan Province, which lies next to  Bangkok, there has been broad interest and many requests for  more information from our readers. THAN SETTHAKIT correspondents  have reported on the progress of this situation, and a source in  the Office of the National Commission for Energy Policy (SPhCh)  revealed that a check on large factories in Samut Prakan  indicated that many used furnace oil with 3.5 percent sulfur.  This was thought to be the cause for the ``acid rain'' problem.  In addition to the Phra Nakhon Tai [South Bangkok] electrical  plant, it was found that there were 37 factories out of the  approximately 3,000 in Samut Prakan which released from 21.6  tons per year to 1,720 tons per year of sulfur dioxide. The  trend was for these factories to release more sulfur dioxide  every year.    ``Those in industry still do not feel that it is important  to  deal with acid rain and are not prepared to switch from high- to  low sulfur furnace oil. They generally claim that it would  increase costs. Therefore we will probably need some procedure  to induce these factories to change so that the problem can be  solved,'' the source felt.    The same source said that at present the government did not  have any procedures to compel them to reduce sulfur dioxide  emissions. And the standard for sulfur dioxide of 300 micrograms  per cubic meter was a standard for testing the atmosphere. No  procedure had been specified for measuring the release of sulfur  dioxide by individual facilities. Also, there was no procedure  for punishing violators. These were the problems which made it  difficult to avoid pollution.    As for the 37 large factories mentioned, these were  generally  in heavy industry and included the Thai-Asahi Glass Factory, the  Ajinomoto MSG Factory, the Krungthep Steel Factory, Thai Phatana  Steel, as well as paper mills and textile factories. Mr. Prasoet  Bunsamphan, the Deputy Director of the Petroleum Authority of  Thailand(PTT), made an interesting point. At the beginning of  last October the PTT had signed a contract to sell 3,600 million  liters of furnace oil with a sulfur content of 3.5 percent to  the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) over 3  years for about 10,400 million baht to supply the Phranakhon Tai  electrical plant and the Bang Pakong electrical plant. This was  in addition to the 28,955 million liters normally supplied to  the KFPh.    According to the signed contract, the PTT is to bring in  furnace oil with 3.5 percent sulfur content but may substitute  furnace oil with less sulfur for an additional 30 to 35 satang  per liter if EGAT is willing to use it. This could increae the  price of electricity by 1 to 1.5 satang per unit. When one  calculates the increase in expense and considers that the  government does not have any policy of supporting this through  reduced import duties for low-sulfur furnace oil, then one can  see that this might be very difficult for EGAT.    At present the Phra Nakhon Tai electrical plant and the Phra  Nakhon Neua [North Bangkok] electrical plant use 2,600 million  liters per year of 3.5 percent sulfur furnace oil. The factories  in Bangkok and Samut Prakan use 1,300 million liters per year.  In the past the PTT imported 50 million liters of 2 percent  sulfur furnace oil for the Phra Nakhon Tai electrical plant.  This apparently created a burden inasmuch as the price was  higher than the contracted price. If the government adopted  measures to compel factories in both Bangkok and Samut Prakan to  use low-sulfur oil, this burden would disappear because they  would be able to shift the burden of the price of the furnace  oil which met standards onto the factories instead.    ``If EGAT should import low-sulfur furnace oil, although it  might appear that all the burden was shifted to it or the  factories, in fact in the past the price of 3 percent sulfur  furnace oil has been higher: U.S.$15 to U.S.$17 per barrel --  whereas now the price has dropped to only U.S.$11 to U.S.$12 per  barrel. If 2 percent sulfur furnace oil were imported, the  investment would be 30 to 35 satang per liter higher, but this  would still be lower than when the price of furnace oil was high  as in the past,'' Mr. Prasoet said.    The EGAT deputy director also said that the Commission for  Considering a National Energy Policy, chaired by Dr. Sawit  Phothiwihok, minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office,  was considering making an announcement compelling factories both  in Bangkok and Samut Prakan to use low-sulfur oil with 2 percent  sulfur. But there was still the problem that many factories were  not willing to use it. Nevertheless the announcement is expected  this November.    Mr. Yothin Tanthansakun, the Director of the Division for  Safety and the Environment of the Toyota Motor Company  (Thailand) Ltd., offered information worth following up on: if  Samut Prakan pollution damages the finish of the company's  already assembled cars this season, the company would correct  this by applying wax to prevent corrosion. To be sure about  this, he said that ``Toyota officials are checking to see if  acid rain is causing this damage.''</p>

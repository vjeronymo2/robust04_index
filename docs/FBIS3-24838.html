Addressing about 500 supporters in the D H  Williams recreation centre in Katlehong, Mr Mandela said he had  cancelled a two-day visit to the Angolan capital Luanda because  of the urgency of the situation on the East Rand. [words  indistinct] "I have asked for that meeting to be postponed  because of the implication of the meeting I am attending." Mr  Mandela would have met with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos  and Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano in Luanda.    Mr Mandela said "this (peace) plan is intended to save lives  here and bring about stability in the region". The announcement  of the withdrawal of the Internal Stability Division [ISD] in  the area drew thunderous cheers from the crowd. Mr Mandela said  the ISD withdrawal would be welcomed by all.    In reply to a question whether the move would not be opposed  by mainly Zulu-speaking hostel residents, Mr Mandela said: "I  think they are the only people who would like the ISU [Internal  Stability Unit] to remain in the area. The rest do not want the  ISU to remain here even for a day," Mr Mandela said to the  approval of the crowd.    He urged the Inkatha Freedom Party to involve itself in the  peace plan and repeated an invitation to the party to send a  representative to participate in the appointed task group formed  to oversee the peace process.    Regarding the violence in Natal, Mr Mandela said: "We have  embarked on a number of strategies to formulate means to stop  violence."    The ANC leader told supporters it would be improper for him  to be seen announcing the peace plan from the Union Buildings in  Pretoria and that it had to be seen to be done in the area  plagued by the violence. Regarding Mr de Klerk's absence at the  announcement of the plan in Katlehong, Mr Mandela said: "His  diary would not allow it."    Mr de Klerk released details of the peace plan to the media  at 4PM on Tuesday while Mr Mandela made the announcement  simultaneously at the community centre in Katlehong.    The statement issued by Mr de Klerk was read to the audience  by the Transitional Executive Council member Mac Maharaj who  visited the area recently to investigate the situation.    Mr Mandela said the East Rand was responsible for 80 per  cent  of the national total of victims of violence.</p>

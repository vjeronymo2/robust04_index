			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DOWNING WON'T QUIT OR SEEK A TRADE TO A'S;  </P> <P> ANGELS: BUT VETERAN BELIEVES HE HAS BEEN UNJUSTLY CAST ASIDE, AND DOESN'T WANT  TO END HIS CAREER SITTING ON THE BENCH.  </P> <P> It seemed a perfect fit to Brian Downing.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco is hampered by a hand injury, and the Oakland Athletics might need  an extra bat. Downing saw himself as the answer, though it would mean leaving  the Angels after more than 12 seasons.  </P> <P> "It'd break my heart," Downing said, "but hell, so would this."  </P> <P> Downing conceded Monday that this scenario has little chance of occurring, but  he feels he has been unjustly cast aside by the team for which he has played  more games (1,595) than any other player.  </P> <P> His appearance in Monday's lineup was his 30th in 72 games and he carried in a  .228 average, his highest since the first week of the season. However, he said  he would not ask to be traded.  </P> <P> Nor does he intend to quit. "I wish I could. I'm not man enough to do that and  a lot of people would be very disappointed in me if I do that," said Downing,  who will be 40 in October and is in the last year of a contract that pays him  $1.25 million. "If that had been true, I'd have been out of here several months  ago. . . .  </P> <P> "I just kind of got tired of the indifference. Everybody was so quick to write  me off and treat me like a piece of (dirt). That's all. If I had any doubt  (about my abilities), I certainly wouldn't volunteer to play for the Oakland  A's, would I?"  </P> <P> Angels General Manager Mike Port, who met with Downing about a month ago to  discuss his future, was returning to California from New York on Monday and  could not be reached for comment. Manager Doug Rader said Downing's situation  had been settled a month ago.  </P> <P> "Brian's changed his mind, but I don't feel a public forum is the place to  comment," Rader said. "He's a member of the 25-man roster and as such he's a  member of a team. Everybody that's part of the team needs to be counted on to  produce. That's how I look at Brian, Wally Joyner, Kent Anderson or Mark  Eichhorn. . . . My responsibility is to do the best I can for the team using  all the tools available to me."  </P> <P> Downing said he can't physically play defense for a National League team and  thought Oakland made sense because it's next-closest to Anaheim among American  League teams.  </P> <P> He added he was not seeking a trade to a contending team just to reach the  World Series, because "it wouldn't be like getting a ring with a halo on it."  </P> <P> "Everybody wants to play or they shouldn't be here," said Downing, who said  this would be his last season. "I don't want to do this again.'  </P> <P> He added, "It's not like I'm a malcontent or anything. I've kept pretty quiet.  It's not a lot of fun. I don't see myself sitting on the bench spitting  sunflower seeds and scraping pine tar.  </P> <P> "I still feel like I can do a lot and I thought the opportunity might be there  in a great situation. I'd thought about it for some time but there never was an  opening.  </P> <P> "It just so happened I heard on TV and said, 'That's a possible fit.' I never  would have considered it a couple of months ago. But you hear things and read  things and it wears on you. I have a lot of pride and respect. It's probably  dead now, but I don't take it back. I really don't serve much purpose here."  </P></p>

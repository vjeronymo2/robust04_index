This area seasonally exhibits high concentrations of red and brown algae that make trawling with TEDs impracticable. This final rule authorizes a 30-minute tow limit through August 15, 1994; a 55-minute tow limit from August 16 through October 31, 1994; and a 75-minute tow limit from November 1 through November 30, 1994, to allow shrimp trawlers to harvest shrimp efficiently during their traditional shrimping season (March through November) and maintain adequate protection for sea turtles in this area.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  June 27, 1994.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Send comments to Dr. William Fox, Jr., Director, Office of Protected Resources, NMFS, 1335 East-West Highway, Silver Spring, MD 20910.

Sea turtle conservation regulations at 50 CFR parts 217 and 227 require all shrimp trawlers, regardless of length, in offshore waters of the Atlantic Area, including off North Carolina, to have an approved TED installed year-round in each net rigged for fishing, unless specifically exempted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS has allowed shrimpers in the North Carolina restricted area to limit tow-times, rather than use TEDs, due to the presence of algae that makes trawling with TED-equipped nets impracticable. A comprehensive list of cites relating to this exemption is as follows: 57 FR 33452 (July 29, 1992); 57 FR 40859 (September 8, 1992); 57 FR 45986 (October 6, 1992); 57 FR 52735 (November 5, 1992); 57 FR 57968 (December 8, 1992); 58 FR 19631 (April 12, 1993); 58 FR 28793 (May 12, 1993); 58 FR 33219 (June 11, 1993); 58 FR 38537 (July 13, 1993); and 58 FR 43820 (August 18, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS proposed a permanent exemption on May 25, 1993 (58 FR 30007), and a discussion of special environmental conditions, an assessment of the algae problem, a history of the local fishery, and a discussion of tow times can be found there. Comments received on the proposed rule were addressed in an interim final rule extending the tow-time allowance through November 30, 1993 (September 21, 1993, 58 FR 48975). No comments were received on the most recent interim final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule implements the exemption through November 30, 1994, instead of permanently, as provided in the proposed rule. NMFS decided to implement this final rule only for the current fishing season for several reasons. First, NMFS believes that close review of algae conditions and tow time compliance is necessary to ensure that the exemption is effective in preventing incidental takes. Second, NMFS is considering implementation of an incidental take permit system under section 10 of the ESA that could authorize this exemption through an incidental take permit. An incidental take permit would require periodic NMFS review and a conservation plan, thereby ensuring consistent enforcement and mitigation of any incidental takes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NMFS' review of the North Carolina restricted area exemption program for the 1992&hyph;1993 season indicates that sea turtle mortalities do not appear to be associated with the allowance of tow times in lieu of TEDs. NMFS has reached this conclusion based on the lack of observer-documented takes, the observed compliance with tow-time restrictions, the cooperation of the fishermen, the small number of participants in the fishery, and the local knowledge required to trawl in the restricted area without losing gear on bottom obstructions (which effectively limits entry into the fishery). These factors are discussed in previous temporary rules and in the proposed rule (see above citations). NMFS is particularly concerned about possible interactions between shrimping operations and turtles during the turtle nesting season. NMFS will continue to monitor this situation during the remainder of the 1994 shrimping season.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

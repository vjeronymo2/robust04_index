			<p>930405 FT  05 APR 93 / Arts: Queen of Spades - Opera For the English National Opera on Saturday, Chaikovsky's Pushkin opera was revived by their departing director of productions, David Pountney, in his own decade-old staging, and conducted by their soon-to-be music director, Sian Edwards. Overall it was deadly: stiff, unmoving, interminable. A lot of prommers must be ENO regulars too; on the strength of the marvellous Queen of Spades prom from Glyndebourne last summer, many of them may have booked to see it fully staged at the Coliseum - and some of them were probably among the many customers who left without apologies after Act 2. The performances cannot but improve as the run continues. Some of the components are excellent, though on this first night they added up to nothing much. Miss Edwards drew strong, cultivated Chaikovsky playing from the band. It struck me for the first time that the funereal interlude in Act 3 must stem from the third-act entr'acte of Parsifal, which Chaikovsky knew but professed to despise. In principle, for the obsessional anti-hero of Pushkin's novella the high-strung brightness of Graeme Matheson-Bruce's tenor was entirely apt. Peter Sidom, as the urbane Tomsky, was a model of clarity and man-of-the-world slyness; Anthony Michaels-Moore rose splendidly and with sonorous dignity to the central aria of Prince Yeletsky. Unfortunately Matheson-Bruce often sang slightly, distressingly flat, and his supposed inamorata Lisa (Janice Cairns, unbecomingly costumed) was both harsh and flat. As the old countess, Patricia Payne was very nearly a pantomime dame: not her fault. Nearly everybody's words were laudably clear, which let us hear all too well just how leaden and banal the English translation is. In an opera so full of arias in slowish, gently confessional mode, a stilted text makes a heavy burden. In any case, extracting plausible dramatic performances from the principals seems to have had low priority in this production. It is one of Pountney's 'white dreams', swathed in as much gauze as his later, far stronger production of Janacek's Osud. It has its visual moments, largely in the style of Romantic ballet - some supernumerary dancing witches suggest childhood memories of a Robert Helpmann show - but the stage forces are deployed so coldly and formally that only potently affecting lead singers might break through the ice. Lacking those, the evening remains grimly frigid. Supported by the Friends of English National Opera</p>

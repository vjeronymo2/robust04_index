			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Some confidence returned to equity derivatives, with several large-scale buyers pepping up the session, Christine Buckley writes. The buyers, thought by some market watchers to be US-based, operated through the independent traders delivering a few large orders on the June contract on the FT-SE 100. For the first time in recent sessions June traded at a premium to cash for large stretches of the day. The contract had started on a healthy note - opening just one point short of the cash index. June has suffered poor fortunes in recent days, usually trading at a substantial discount to cash. Volume jumped to 21,207 contracts reflecting the arrival of buying interest. But derivatives traders were reluctant to speak of a sustained rally, suspecting that investors remained nervous. The contract closed at 3,032, six points behind cash after having traded in a band of over 50 points. Traded options were also more enlivened at 31,418 lots with index options again the biggest feature, accounting for more than half of the trade. A calendar spread was said to have been conducted in National Power with 500 June puts sold and 500 September puts bought. British Gas was the most heavily traded of the stock options at 1,770 contracts.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> SEX SCANDAL FIGURE HIDING IN BALI  </P> <P> A former Indian beauty queen at the center of a British sex and politics  scandal has been on the island of Bali since the beginning of the week,  immigration officials said today.  </P> <P> Locals say 27-year-old Pamella Bordes, who has been working as a researcher at  the House of Commons for a Conservative member, is in hiding near the hill town  of Ubud.  </P> <P> Bordes left London after British tabloid newspapers made a series of  allegations two weeks ago about her private life, including links to an unnamed  Cabinet minister, two British national newspaper editors and a Libyan security  official. The suggestion of a connection with Libya, with which Britain has no  diplomatic ties, sparked an outcry about possible security breaches.  </P></p>

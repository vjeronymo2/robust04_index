			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts Long gilt yields scarcely flinched after the Bank of England announced on Friday that it had scheduled an auction of long-dated stock later this month. That suggests there is still enough demand from domestic institutions to absorb the Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn in stock which will be on offer. But the Bank also has little choice. It cannot afford to disrupt its funding programme so it must simply assume enough domestic demand to satisfy its needs. Exchange rate worries mean gilts are receiving little support from overseas at present: witness the softness of prices in the 10-year range normally favoured by foreign buyers. Sooner or later, however, the government will need the help of foreign investors too. While equities remain weak, it may be natural for UK institutions to put new cash into gilts, especially if they believe inflation will eventually fall to almost nothing. Investing at the long-end not only fits with their liability schedules. It is also the point on the maturity spectrum best insulated from the turmoil that would follow any increase in base rates to protect sterling. Yet these same investors also have to consider that, despite the market's frenzied optimism in the immediate aftermath of the election, the total return on gilts bought at the April auction has barely exceeded that on cash. Doubtless they would be quick to redirect their attention to equities at the first sign of real life in that market. The hope must be that the same factor which eventually revives shares will also rekindle the enthusiasm of foreign investors for gilts. A devaluation will hardly fit the bill. Doubts on that score are liable to remain until after next month's French referendum on the Maastricht treaty. The Bank must be hoping they do not get strong enough to discourage domestic investors as well.</p>

			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Observer: Left feet Roll up, roll up, for round two of the fight to give the TUC a friendly face. After yesterday's conference on full employment, the TUC is holding a 'fiesta' in Brighton on Saturday to show off the 'new face' of trade union campaigning. All the fun of the congress - composite motions, deletions and walk-outs - have been quietly muffled to allow a carnival of bands, buskers, clowns and jugglers to perform beneath a big screen television. Once a symbol of Big Brother, the screen is showing live coverage of the World Cup finals. Sensibly, TUC general secretary John Monks, shadow chancellor Gordon Brown and the union barons addressing an old-fashioned rally have promised to be out of the way before the big match.</p>

			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Turkey steps up Kurd offensive: Eight-year conflict enters decisive phase TURKEY'S largest military operation against Kurdish guerrillas continued yesterday, in what officials expect to be the decisive phase in the eight-year conflict with the Kurdish Workers party (PKK). Officials confirmed that at least 20,000 troops, backed by tanks and armoured personnel carriers, were operating in northern Iraq, near the border town of Zakho. Commandos, supported by aircraft and helicopters, were also reported to be fighting rebel forces in mountain valleys near Hakurk, close to the Iranian border. The offensive is spurred largely by growing public demands for a strong government response to the PKK's increasingly violent campaign for independence. Since 1984 the conflict has claimed more than 5,000 lives, with at least 2,000 people dying this year. Since the withdrawal of allied forces from northern Iraq and the end of relief efforts to help the Iraqi Kurds, the PKK has intensified attacks on Turkish border positions. In recent months rebel tactics have changed, with guerrillas attacking Turkish positions in groups of 200 or more, and with increasing ferocity. Last weekend, for example, rebels blew up a bridge, near the eastern city of Mus, on the main rail line to Iran and reprisal attacks on Kurdish villages supporting the government are more ruthless. The Turkish military has long recognised that the PKK's ability to sustain conflict depends on the organisation being able to infiltrate guerrillas across the border. Ankara also realises that an estimated 150,000 troops in the border region cannot seal the frontier, so it has put together a diplomatic and military strategy to cut off the PKK in their sanctuaries. Both Syria and Iran have offered support to Turkey. A security protocol signed with Damascus was initially greeted with scepticism in Ankara, but Turkish officials believe the Syrians are sticking to their promise to close PKK camps in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa valley in Lebanon. Overtures to Iran produced less concrete results. But this week, following Prime Minister Suleyman Demirel's visit to Tehran, Iran announced it had deployed a brigade-size force to man its border with Iraq, apparently to block the PKK's retreat. Turkey faces little international criticism. The US State Department this week reiterated its backing for Ankara's fight against the organisation, while urging it to ensure 'the political rights of all Turkish citizens, including those of Kurdish origin'. Western officials are keen for the government to use any military gains to hasten its earlier promise of democratic reform; so far the worsening violence has been used to stall human rights reform. But the critical factor is the tacit co-operation Ankara has won from the Kurdish Pesh Mergas in Iraq. Turkish and Pesh Mergas forces were yesterday engaging the PKK in what one diplomat described as a 'loosely co-ordinated' operation, following moves on Sunday by the Iraqi Kurdish assembly to issue a final ultimatum to the PKK to withdraw from the border area. But, as a senior Turkish Foreign Ministry official said: 'It's not easy for the Pesh Mergas. Kurds are killing Kurds.' The PKK has already retaliated with an intimidation campaign against truck drivers travelling to north Iraq, in effect imposing an embargo on vital supplies to Kurdish-held areas. Turkey's security presence is being strengthened on the main border road to Harbur Bridge. But Ankara is in no hurry to see the PKK embargo lifted, as it underlines how much the Iraqi Kurds rely on Turkish support. Not surprisingly, there were reports yesterday that the PKK was negotiating a deal with the Pesh Mergas to allow it to withdraw south.</p>

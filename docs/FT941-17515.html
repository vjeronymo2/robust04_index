			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / People: Edsel claws his way up It cannot be easy having the most infamous first name in US automobile history, but Edsel Ford II nevertheless seems to be managing pretty well, writes Patrick Harverson. The 44-year old Ford, who shares a name with the Ford Edsel, the car that bombed so spectacularly in the 1950s that its name eventually became synonymous with failure, has been made a vice-president of the auto manufacturer. His promotion has sparked speculation that he is being groomed for the top job at the company his great-grandfather founded in 1903. 'He is clawing his way to the top,' remarked one Wall Street analyst. Although the family owns 40 per cent of the voting stock, a Ford has not run the company since 1980, when Henry Ford II stepped down as chairman. So it is understandable that the latest promotion of Edsel Ford has attracted some attention. Edsel Ford is currently president of the group's finance arm, Ford Motor Credit; he has previously worked in the company's sales and marketing and international operations, a breadth of experience that will serve him in good stead should he ever end up running Ford. His chance may come as soon as the end of this decade, when the recently appointed chairman, Alexander Trotman, is expected to retire. In spite of his nearly 20 years at Ford, however, there are still doubts over whether Edsel Ford has earned his promotions entirely on merit. David Healy, motor industry analyst at SG Warburg in New York, says that Edsel Ford's appointment as vice-president 'really has more to do with the fact that this is a family company than it does with any normal executive decision'. Another, less charitable analyst, concurs, saying of Edsel: 'Look, if his name wasn't Ford, he wouldn't be a candidate for the top job.'</p>

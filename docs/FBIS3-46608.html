			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The General Staff of the Khmer Royal Armed Forces  [KRAF]:    The Democratic Kampuchea faction should have been aware that  between September and October 1993 more than 3,000 of its  officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers returned to  the national fold, enjoying both the moral and material  assistance of the royal government under the leadership of His  Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk Varaman.    These gentlemen have now loyally joined the national  community and been inducted as KRAF officers, non-commissioned  officers, and soldiers under the leadership of our venerated  king father. For this reason, those of you who are officers,  non-commissioned officers, and soldiers still suffering under  the command of the Khmer Rouge recalcitrants, who continue to  use you as a shield to die and become disabled in their place,  should stop following the dark road of the Khmer Rouge leaders  and rebel against and attack these stubborn leaders and return  to the national community.    The General Staff appeals to you to hurry in order to avoid  the upcoming confrontations. Return to the national community  and you will be rewarded with positions, duties, and ranks  commensurate with your individual capabilities and achievements.  All KRAF units positioned throughout the country and nearby  competent authorities are waiting to welcome you with cordiality  and sincerity. They will consider you faithful and loyal to the  country, religion, and the king.    [Signed] General Ke Kimyan, chief of the General Staff of  the  KRAF</p>

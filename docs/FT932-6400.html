			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Observer: Clickety click Kenneth Clarke's appointment as chancellor of the exchequer continues a recent tradition - that the man at number 11, Downing St, should have six letters in his surname. Four out of the previous six chancellors - Barber, Healey, Lawson and Lamont - have met this criterion, and the 'sixers' have been in office for 18 of the last 23 years. The two exceptions - Howe and Major - both saw recessions start during their term of office. That either means that Kenneth Clarke's appointment is a good omen for the UK economy, or that he will lose his job before the next recession begins.</p>

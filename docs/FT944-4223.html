			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Budget Statement: Brown hits out at 'panic measures' - Labour's response Labour said the mini-Budget showed that the government was out of touch with public opinion and unfit to be in charge of the nation's finances. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said the statement 'shows a government that has been stumbling from crisis to crisis, from panic measure to panic measure; a government that is, at its core, incompetent and unfair'. Mr Brown said that the country had been relieved by the chancellor's decision to scrap the second tranche of value added tax on heating fuel after Tuesday's Commons defeat. But voters would ask 'why it has to take 18 months and four Budgets to bring forward the alternative measures that the government could have proposed in the first place'. Mr Brown said that the tax rises announced by the chancellor would cost taxpayers an average of Pounds 22.36 a year, increasing the total impact of tax changes since 1992 to Pounds 875 a year for a typical family. 'That is in breach of election promises that were made that there would be no tax rises at all,' he said. Mr Brown accused Mr Clarke of withdrawing not only the additional 25p a week compensation for pensioners promised to Tory backbenchers during the VAT debate on Tuesday, but also 30p a week promised last year. 'Will you now explain to 10m pensioners and others on low income why you are so out of touch . . . that you are clawing back the compensation for pensioners while you insist on going ahead with cuts in the price of champagne? 'You are punishing pensioners when it is the Conservative party that should be paying the price for the government's mistakes,' he said. Mr Brown said the government had no need to raise taxes to replace the lost revenue because its forecasts made no provision for up to Pounds 1bn in capital gains and corporation tax due from the flotation of the National Grid. He told Mr Clarke: 'The underlying truth of your Budget measures today is that, to pay for the sole remaining policy this government now has, which is tax cuts next year, the government will contemplate any tax rises.' Mr Clarke, in a robust attack cheered wildly by Tory MPs, dismissed Mr Brown's comments as 'infantile'. He accused him of 'trying to deceive people by pretending there are accountancy devices which will produce money from nowhere'. Mr Clarke told Labour MPs who voted against the second tranche of VAT: 'These are not my first options. These are my second options - and you have discovered there are disadvantages with some of them.' Recalling a favourite saying of Lord Healey, the chancellor told Mr Brown: 'A previous Labour chancellor was fond of using the phrase 'silly billy'. I think that is flattering for you.' However, Labour officials believe that the mini-Budget has greatly increased the authority of Mr Brown, who was yesterday praised by Mr Tony Blair, Labour leader, for his skilful parliamentary campaign to force a vote on VAT.</p>

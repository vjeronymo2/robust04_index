			<p>BFN     [Text] The Islamic Republic of Iran and Syria believe that  peace talks with the Zionist regime are nothing but a plot and  no peace awaits the region. This was stated by Majles Deputy  Speaker Hasan Rowhani, who had gone to Syria at the head of a  delegation, after his return to Tehran last night. He said that  his talks with Syrian officials and combatant Palestinian and  Lebanese groups covered Middle East problems and recent  developments in the occupied territories.    The Majles deputy speaker added that in these talks all the  combatant Palestinian and Lebanese groups emphasized the fact  that under current sensitive conditions, arrogance should be  strongly confronted and the disgrace of compromise with the  Zionists should not be accepted. He said that talks with these  groups, which focused on the consolidation and continuation of  the struggle against world arrogance and the Zionist regime,  were fruitful.    During his visit to Syria, in addition to his discussions  with the Syrian president and other officials, Rowhani also met  with some Hizballah deputies in the Lebanese parliament.</p>

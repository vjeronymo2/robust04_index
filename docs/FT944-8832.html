			<p>941118 FT  18 NOV 94 / Pacific Dunlop share price hit by lawsuit fears Shares in Pacific Dunlop, the Australian conglomerate, fell to a five-year low in heavy trading yesterday amid speculation that the company could face product liability suits over pacemakers made by one of its subsidiaries, Telectronics, and sold internationally. Late in the afternoon, Pacific Dunlop put out a statement, saying that Telectronics had withdrawn three models of pacemakers leads, and that physicians who implanted these devices were monitoring patients. The company said the decision followed reports of lead failures 'over recent years'. Mr Phillip Brass, managing director, said the leads first came on the market in 1987, while the group had become aware of problems 'largely in the last three years'. Pacific Dunlop said seven failures had been reported in an implanted population of 42,000 recipients since December 1987. Of these seven failures, six were in the US, where two patients have died. One further failure was in Australia, where 1,169 leads of this type have been implanted. The leads connect the pulse generator - which electronically stimulates the heart - to the heart tissue. Pacific Dunlop noted that the leads had been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and said it was still studying the problem. 'Preliminary information indicates a fracture in an implanted lead can be identified by X-ray,' it said, adding that four faulty leads had been identified in this way in Japan. On the legal issue, Mr Brass said the group had received no product liability suits. Telectronics has sales of around ADollars 400m (Pounds 181m), a third of which come from the US, out a group total of ADollars 7bn. Pacific Dunlop has been introducing a new generation of leads, but says these have yet to gain FDA approval, although other regulatory regimes have given a green light. The product withdrawal, therefore, has most effect on sales in the US, although pacemakers made by the company can still be implanted using alternative leads. The statement came after the market closed. The shares fell 15 cents, after a 12-cent fall on Wednesday, to ADollars 3.62.</p>

One of the hijackers, a man who was  injured when police captured the pair on Tuesday, had been armed  with an imitation pistol, a police spokesman said. An unarmed  woman with him was seized unhurt.    The Saudia airline company stated that some 140 Ethiopian  passengers who had been freed before police ended the hijack bid  were flown Wednesday to Addis Ababa on a special flight. Press  reports Wednesday said that the hijackers were illegal  immigrants and added that they had a third accomplice who  managed to merge with other passengers, but a police spokesman  said this was "speculation." [passage omitted]    Most of the passengers were Ethiopian Muslims who had been  on  pilgrimage to the Islamic holy city of Mecca and whose Saudi  visas had expired, diplomatic sources said. A number of them  had tried illegally to remain in Saudi Arabia but had been  expelled, the sources added. Ethiopian Ambassador to Kenya  Ofato Alew told AFP that embassy staff had played no part in the  negotiations and were not officially informed of the affair.  [passage omitted]</p>

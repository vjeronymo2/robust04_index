			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIN, SNOW, RECORD WARMTH HIT MIDWEST  </P> <P> Severe and unusual weather struck the Mississippi Valley and the northern  Midwest on Wednesday with snow, thunderstorms and record high temperatures,  while the Northwest braced for another storm and more flooding.  </P> <P> Strong thunderstorms continued through the day over northeast Mississippi with  a large area of rain and scattered thunderstorms over western Tennessee,  Louisiana, Arkansas, southeast Texas, northern Alabama and the Florida  Panhandle, weather officials said.  </P> <P> The storms produced strong, gusting winds near Vicksburg and Jackson, Miss.,  and the Warren County sheriff's office reported that trees had been blown down  in the region.  </P> <P> In Indiana, at least 1,000 people were forced from their homes Wednesday, some  evacuated by boat, after two days of rain overflowed creeks and ditches,  officials said.  </P> <P> The heavy rain in northwest Indiana later abated, but the National Weather  Service issued a flood warning for the Kankakee River through Saturday. Two  emergency shelters were set up in Lake County for those left homeless by high  water.  </P> <P> As much as 5 1/2 inches of rain soaked parts of the Chicago metropolitan area  and more than three inches fell in Peoria, Ill.  </P> <P> A Chicago man drowned when his car became submerged in 10 feet of water beneath  a viaduct. John Appleton, 62, was found unconscious by divers and was  pronounced dead at Olympia Fields Osteopathic Medical Center.  </P> <P> Missouri was recovering from severe storms and tornadoes Tuesday that injured  30 people and destroyed homes, businesses and vehicles. Gov. John Ashcroft went  to the O'Fallon area, about 30 miles outside of St. Louis, early Wednesday to  inspect the damage from winds that gusted to 70 m.p.h.  </P> <P> Fire Chief David House said damage was estimated at $36 million, but he said  that figure could go higher.  </P> <P> The only serious injury reported was a hunter who was in critical condition  Wednesday in suburban St. Louis after being found under the debris of a house.  </P> <P> Two tornadoes also were spotted in the state but caused no serious damage,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Elsewhere, records for warm and wet weather were set at the same time snow  advisories were posted in the upper Midwest.  </P> <P> Snow fell through nearly all of northeast Minnesota and northern Wisconsin with  accumulations of up to seven inches. Freezing rain was falling on the western  third of upper Michigan.  </P> <P> But just to the south, a record temperature of 68 degrees was set in Detroit,  topping by five degrees a record set in 1960.  </P> <P> Among high temperature records set or tied for the date Wednesday were Akron,  Ohio, 68; Albany, N.Y., 75; Atlantic City, N.J., 68; Boston, 69; Buffalo, N.Y.,  72; Burlington, Vt., 66; Cleveland, 68; Concord, N.H., 71; Pittsburgh, Pa., 71,  and Portland, Me., 60.  </P> <P> A record of another sort was set in Grand Rapids, Mich., where this month was  declared the second wettest November on record. The 2.99 inches of rain that  fell Tuesday through Wednesday morning also was a record for a 24-hour period.  </P> <P> In another wet region, residents of western Washington state braced for another  storm that carried the potential for high winds, heavy rain and additional  flooding.  </P> <P> Southerly winds reaching 40 m.p.h. were expected inland as a cold front moved  in from the Gulf of Alaska carrying warm, moist air that could lift snow levels  to 6,000 feet, adding to the threat of already high rivers flooding their  banks.  </P></p>

			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / BR threatens to shelve rolling stock renewal BRITISH Rail is threatening to postpone orders for new rolling stock for five years as part of a campaign to win extra government funding for railway investment. Also likely to be shelved until 1997 unless there is more funding is the Pounds 4.5bn Channel tunnel rail link and the Pounds 1bn development of London's second Channel tunnel rail terminal at King's Cross. That would mean that it will be well into the next century before the high-speed link is completed. With the recession depressing BR's revenue and income from property sales, Sir Bob Reid, chairman of BR, has told Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, that the company has only enough money to cover safety and maintenance programmes. While the government increased BR's borrowing limit for the current year by almost Pounds 1bn in the last Autumn Statement, the amount available for investment will tail off in the following years. In what will be seen as an early bid for an increase in funds in the autumn public-expenditure white paper, BR is warning that without additional borrowing there will be no new orders of rolling stock in the next five years. Orders for 1,500 new Networker coaches for Network SouthEast's Kent coast services - costing Pounds 700m - would be postponed. The introduction of the new generation of InterCity 250 trains on the line linking London, Manchester and Glasgow would be shelved to save Pounds 350m. Much-needed improvements in track and signalling on the line would go ahead, but line straightening to increase maximum speeds above the present 125mph would be postponed. BR estimates that it needs an extra Pounds 7bn to fund the four key projects.</p>

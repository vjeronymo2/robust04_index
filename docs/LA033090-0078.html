			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> KGB TELLS OF FOILING KREMLIN ATTACKS  </P> <P> Special KGB guards who protect Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other  top leaders have stopped would-be assassins who tried to enter government  buildings with sawed-off shotguns and knives, according to a report Thursday in  the Communist Party daily Pravda.  </P> <P> "Every month our men in the Kremlin, on Red Square and other places expose and  detain about a dozen people with criminal intentions," a KGB general, Yuri S.  Plekhanov, told Pravda.  </P> <P> Even with glasnost, Gorbachev's policy of greater openness, officials  previously had not discussed attempted attacks on top leaders.  </P> <P> Plekhanov said guards for top leaders have not had to use weapons since World  War II. Recently, he said, a man in the reception room of the Communist Party  Central Committee pulled a shotgun but was disarmed.  </P></p>

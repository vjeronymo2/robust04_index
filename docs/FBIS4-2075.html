			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The United States  should take positive and pragmatic steps to cast aside man-made  obstacles and make joint efforts with China to push forward the  bilateral trade and economic relations, Chinese Minister of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi said here today on  the eve of her U.S. trip.    China's sustained, fast and healthy economic growth and its  grandiose development plan will create even more favorable trade  and investment opportunities for U.S. enterprises, the minister  told XINHUA in an exclusive interview barely a week before she  starts her U.S. trip with a trade delegation.  <H5>  JCCT Session Important </H5>   Wu said that the most important thing during her mission is  to co-chair, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the  Eighth Session of the Sino-U.S. Joint Committee on Commerce and  Trade (JCCT), scheduled for April 13-14 in Washington, D.C..    The annual government-level meeting is a most important  occasion for discussing bilateral economic and trade relations  and other related issues, she said. It represents another major  event following the Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle and the  talks between finance and foreign ministers of the two countries.    She revealed that during the forthcoming session, the two  sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and  cooperation and issues concerning legal matters in such areas as  information, energy, transportation, chemical industry and  environmental cooperation.    The Chinese delegation will hold trade and investment  symposiums in Los Angeles and New York on April 11 and 19  respectively, she said.  <H5>  More Investment Projects </H5>   China will offer about 800 investment projects for  discussion  at the symposiums to be jointly sponsored by the Ministry of  Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, the U.S. law firm Graham  and James, and the U.S. Asian Association.    It will be China's largest trade and investment promotion  activity to be held in the United States so far.    The Chinese trading group will be made up of senior  officials, experts and business executives from eight ministries  and commissions of the State Council, three national  corporations and 26 provinces and municipalities.    The projects to be offered include the construction of  hydroelectric and thermal power stations, highways, railways,  airports and wharfs and projects in industrial raw materials for  the machine-building and electronic equipment, electronics,  petrochemical and metallurgical industries as well as in  agriculture, livestock breeding and forestry.    The trading group also plans to buy U.S. goods worth  hundreds  of millions of U.S.dollars.  <H5>  Obstacles </H5>   The minister said that bilateral trade and U.S. investment  in  China have grown continuously in recent years despite some  problems that have cropped out from time to time.    According to statistics from the General Administration of  Customs of China, the bilateral trade jumped from 2.45 billion  U.S. dollars in 1979 to 27.65 billion U.S. dollars in 1993, a  rise of more than 11-fold.    The number of U.S.-funded projects in China has topped 8,000  in the same period, involving a total investment agreed upon  reaching 11 billion U.S. dollars, topping the list of all  foreign investment. More than 50 of the top 500 U.S. firms have  opened businesses in China.    She said that a major reason for the rapid development of  bilateral trade and cooperation is the fact that the two  economies are highly supplementary to each other.    If the bilateral trade and cooperation are to further  develop, Wu Yi said, the U.S. side should take further steps to  remove man-made obstacles.    This includes the lifting of the control on U.S. technology  export to China, the resumption of financing to feasibility  studies for projects undertaken by the U.S. Trade Development  Agency, the resumption of risk guarantee by the private U.S.  Investment Co. for U.S. Investment in China, and the resumption  of preferential loans by the American Import and Export Bank to  relevant construction projects in China.    "Such actions will help further tap the vast potential of  China's imports from the U.S. and the U.S. investment in China,"  Wu said.    MFN and GATT    On the most-favored-nation (MFN) status, Wu said, as a  purely  trade issue, it should not be entangled up with issues with  which it has nothing to do.    A proper handling of MFN status is an important condition  for  the further development of the bilateral trade and economic  cooperation, the minister stressed.    China has long opposed the practice of linking MFN status to  human rights issues, as views on human rights differ greatly  from country to country, she added.    China and the United States have differences of views on the  human rights issue and they may discuss them through other  channels on the basis of mutual respect, non-interference in  each other's internal affairs and seeking common ground while  preserving differences, the Chinese minister stressed. The two  sides should in no way let this non-trade factor to stand in the  way of furthering the bilateral trade and economic cooperation.    On the issue of China's restoration of its contracting party  status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), Wu  said that major progress was made in the 16th session of the  GATT working party on China last month.    During the session, most GATT members voiced their support  for China's early re-entry into GATT, Wu said. The United  States had promised to firmly support China's re-entry into GATT  and China hopes that United States will "keep its promise and be  as good as its word".</p>

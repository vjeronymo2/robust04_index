			<p>930710 FT  10 JUL 93 / Warning on environment clean-up CONGRESSIONAL investigators have warned that the US government could end up paying more to clean up unexploded bombs, abandoned mines and toxic wastes on public lands than it spent on the savings and loan clean-up. A report from the House of Representatives natural resources committee identifies billions of dollars of potential government liabilities for problems such as hazardous chemical dumps and contaminated drainage at old mines in national parks and forests, as well as on lands run by the Bureau of Land Management. The National Park Service alone has identified 2,400 hazardous mine sites and estimates the cost of cleaning them up at around Dollars 200m (Pounds 133m). The Forest Service has an estimated 25,000 mine sites, and the BLM, which has not carried out an estimate, could have hundreds of thousands of sites, the committee reports. Serious mine problems include the Clark Fork sites near Butte, Montana, where the BLM could be liable for Dollars 100m-Dollars 300m of an estimated Dollars 1bn clean-up cost. The report warns, however, that unexploded shells and bombs on former military firing ranges could end up costing the government even more than the abandoned mines, although the liability has drawn less attention. Military base closures mean that responsibility for more ranges will pass from the Pentagon to the BLM. One firing range singled out by the House committee report is the Aberdeen proving ground, where the problems of unexploded shells are exacerbated by an estimated 82,000kg of depleted uranium rounds. At least 15 wildlife refuges are among the sites with unexploded shells. The report also warns of nuclear contamination in Alaska from experiments related to Project Chariot, a 1950s plan that was in the end not executed to create a harbour in northwest Alaska by exploding nuclear bombs. 'The problem has been caused in large measure by government policies that subsidised the exploitation of our natural resources at a time when we lacked the knowledge that we have today about the negative impact of those subsidies. What is truly frightening is that despite our knowledge we continue to subsidise activities without regard to their devastating environmental - and economic - impacts,' said Mr George Miller, the committee's chairman. While the committee staff presents no overall estimate, it suggests the total clean-up cost, including sites run by the departments of defence and energy and not covered by the report, could rival the bill for reimbursing depositors in the tide of savings and loans institutions which went bankrupt in the 1980s. 'These costs currently do not appear on any government ledger, yet they are genuine liabilities that the taxpayer will one day incur,' Mr Miller said. The Resolution Trust Corporation, set up by the federal government to handle the S&amp;L bailout, has already closed 654 institutions at a cost of Dollars 190.8bn, and has recouped Dollars 88bn of that from asset sales.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Press and TV fear congress more than Yeltsin PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin's decree putting Russian press and broadcasting media 'under his protection' sounded like a Mafia godfather making an offer one could not refuse rather than a reformer protecting liberty. However, it is not generally seen as repressive, partly because the draconian-sounding part of the decree - that armed guards would be posted at the doors of newspapers and broadcasting stations - does not seem to have materialised. As Mr Valentin Starkov, editor of the mass circulation Argumenti i Fakti, pointed out yesterday, he had had militia men on the door for the past year, paying several million roubles a year for the privilege. 'We need them to protect us against the mad people who want to come and see me about something,' he said. Though Russia's press is immeasurably freer than it was even under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev's glasnost regime, it is still significantly constrained. The editors of both main state television channels, Mr Vyacheslav Bragin of Ostankino and Mr Oleg Poptsov of Russian TV, were appointed by Mr Yeltsin and are political, not industry, figures. Most of the national and Moscow press is pro-Yeltsin, even if often critically so. On Mr Khasbulatov's side are only a clutch of communist and nationalist papers, with a couple of papers taking a wavering centrist line. The once-dominant Pravda, now owned by a Greek millionaire and still taking the communist line, has been a strong supporter of Mr Khasbulatov. Its splash headline yesterday was 'The people need a strong Russia: the president needs a strong shock'. Sovyetskaya Rossiya, the communist-nationalist paper of the Russian communist party, takes a similar line. The influential far-right weekly Den prefers Mr Khasbulatov to Mr Yeltsin but really likes neither, while Rabochaya Tribuna, controlled by the Union of Industrialists, and Trud, once the organ of the trade unions and still reflecting their view, are often strongly critical of Mr Yeltsin - though they have preferred, in these early days of presidential rule, to sit on the fence. Mr Starkov, whilecritical of Mr Yeltsin, believes the biggest threat is from parliament. 'I recently received a packet of papers from the parliamentary press office, including a speech from Ruslan Khasbulatov, with a request that I print it. On the basis that the speech had already been aired on TV, I didn't. Even when this paper was controlled by the central committee of the Communist Party, we didn't print speeches like that.' The possibility of a takeover of the media by Congress is real enough: a draft decree was drawn up during the last extraordinary Congress earlier this month to take over TV and radio channels as well as the Itar Tass news service. In an earlier stand-off between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov, the latter tried to repossess the daily Izvestia, once the organ of the USSR Supreme Soviet, arguing that it was still the property of its Soviet successor, the Russian parliament. Mr Khasbulatov did send the parliamentary guards to the paper, but they were withdrawn without incident the next day. Mr Starkov said: 'The president wants to be seen as a preserver of freedom: he wants to show the country and the world his commitment to liberty. And so I don't think there is a threat from his protection. It wouldn't accord with the image he wants to have, to force us to do things.'</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Survey of Software at Work - Autumn 1992 (12): A boon for local managers - New system gives instant access to the right levels of decision-making / User view; British Waterways BRITISH WATERWAYS has installed a network of IBM AS/400 business minicomputers in regional offices which previously did not even have many electric typewriters. The move, part of a devolution of power to the five regions, has given local managers immediate on-line access an control of their own financial, human resources and other information. The network has replaced a central computing set-up, based on a Unisys mainframe running systems, which in some cases were 20 years old. British Waterways is responsible for 2,000 miles of inland waterways and the associated boat-licensing, moorings, waterside property development and sale of water to industry and supply companies. It has around 2,000 employees. The limited experience of administration people with any form of office automation meant that user-support was going to be important in the choice of supplier. 'Peterborough Software were very helpful and gave excellent support to users,' comments Mr Keith Labbett, head of audit, who was in charge of implementing the computing strategy. 'They had standard procedures and guidance notes, which were very useful for users who had not implemented a system before.' British Waterways has installed Peterborough Software's Unipay and Unipersonnel packages. These are run centrally - 'payroll in particular is a difficult beast, with Budget changes every year. It's hard to keep up if the system is installed in six places.' However, the network enables the regions to be in control of their own information. They enter data to the systems and can access information and work on it locally. 'The old systems were inflexible and the information was not timely and sometimes not even accurate,' Keith Labbett says. 'We now have immediate access down to the level where decisions are made. The central human resources unit now acts as an advisory team: the networked system means each manager can become his own personnel manager, too.'

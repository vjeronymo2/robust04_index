			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / Japanese banks condemn competitor over savers' lottery Japan's banking fraternity was divided yesterday when a credit banks' association condemned one of its more ambitious members for launching a lottery to attract new savers. On Monday, Johnan Shinkin (Credit) Bank offered a savings account that made depositors eligible for a twice-yearly raffle. In addition to the normal interest rate on the one-year deposit, savers were offered the incentive of cash prizes of up to Y50,000 (Pounds 318). The scheme was a hit. On the first day, the bank collected Y10bn in deposits. And within hours the bank's anxious rivals had cried foul, accusing Johnan of stealing an unfair march on the rest of the sector. Their objection is that the new account breaches a self-imposed rule that institutions will offer only gifts and not cash bonuses as incentives, and that gifts should not exceed Y1,500 in value. Yesterday the banks' grievance was dignified by Mr Keikichi Kato, chairman of the National Association of Shinkin Banks, who issued an unprecedented censure of Johnan's action. He said it was 'regrettable Johnan was neglecting the association's voluntary rules'. It is very unusual for a financial institution in Japan to break ranks so unapologetically with its competitors, and Johnan's move may herald a more independent approach by the main banks. Observers were sceptical of the the banks' stated concerns. A more serious objection seems to be that Johnan has found a novel way to offer a higher interest rate to depositors. The bank calculates that the average customer has a 3.38 per cent chance of winning a prize, and that the overall effect of the scheme is to offer an extra 0.2 per cent interest to savers. Last month, the remaining regulations on interest rates were finally lifted by the finance ministry, leaving banks free to set their own rates for depositors. But since the changes, most banks have continued to offer remarkably similar rates, and consumer groups have expressed doubt about the strength of their commitment to open competition. A finance ministry official said that, since the banks' rule was voluntary, the ministry was not in a position to act. But he added: 'It is questionable whether it is appropriate for public-spirited financial institutions to set up lotteries in an attempt to gain deposits.' Johnan was unrepentant yesterday. A spokesman said the voluntary restraint was against the spirit of financial deregulation, since it represented 'a form of collusion' among the country's banks to deprive customers of the benefits of freer markets. He dismissed the row as simply 'labour pains' at the birth of a new era in the country's financial system.</p>

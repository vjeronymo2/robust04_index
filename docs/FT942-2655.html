			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Oslo agrees terms with Phillips on Ekofisk field The Norwegian government yesterday agreed terms with Phillips Petroleum for new facilities for the ageing Norwegian North Sea Ekofisk field, ending two years of uncertainty over the future of the field, the hub of the world's largest oil transportation system. The development of new facilities for NKr20bn (Pounds 1.83m) is the biggest investment in an oil field in the Norwegian North Sea sector in six years. The agreement also demonstrates the government's willingness to be more flexible on operating conditions: it extends production periods in Ekofisk for oil companies which have been delaying commitments to develop new oil and gas fields, claiming Norway's tax regime is too stringent at a time when oil prices are relatively low. In 1992 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, the oil industry watchdog, threatened to close the 250,000 b/dfield by 1996 for safety reasons. Phillips last year submitted interim plans to improve the safety and operational reliability of the field which were rejected as inadequate by the authorities. However, the safety issue has been resolved because the old facilities will gradually go as new investment takes place. Phillips Petroleum Norway, which holds 37 per cent of Ekofisk, had been reluctant to invest further in it because its operating licence ran only up to 2011, long before production was due to end. Under the deal, Mr Jens Stoltenberg, the industry and energy minister, said the government would extend Phillips' licence to 2028 and waive a production tariff for the new facilities during the period 1999-2028, saving an estimated NKr900m. These two concessions helped pave the way for Phillips to commit itself to the investment for the new facilities, as they underpinned the economic viability of the field. The government estimates the sales value of petroleum resources in the field at NKr130bn between 1999 and 2028, based on an oil price of NKr108 a barrel. The government also said it would take a direct 5 per cent stake in Ekofisk separate from that of Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which holds 1 per cent. The agreement must clear two hurdles before the development can be realised: the Storting (parliament) must approve the deal and so must shareholders in the field, including Petrofina, which holds a 30 per cent stake, and Agip, which has 13 per cent. The new Ekofisk plan calls for the construction of a simple well-head platform to accommodate 40 wells and for a processing and treatment platform. The well-head platform is due to be installed in 1996 and will use existing processing and treatment facilities until the replacement platform is completed for operation from 1998. Phillips will close seven existing platforms when the new processing and treatment platform becomes operational.</p>

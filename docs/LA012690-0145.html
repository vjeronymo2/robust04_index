			<p><P> January 26, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NEWPORT PRO-AM GOLF;  </P> <P> PARKER HOPES TO KEEP EDGE CLOSE TO HOME  </P> <P> The 36-hole Newport Pro-Am golf tournament begins today at the Newport Beach  Country Club, with 74 professional golfers competing for a $50,000 purse, the  largest in the tournament's 16-year history.  </P> <P> This year's field includes five former Newport tournament winners -- Perry  Parker of Costa Mesa, John McComish, Jon Chaffee, Tony Grimes and Mike Gove.  </P> <P> In addition, four former PGA Tour winners -- Tommy Jacobs, Ernie Gonzales,  Buddy Allin, Mark Pfiel -- and several players from the Golden State and Hogan  mini-tours are expected to compete on the 6,546-yard Newport Beach Country Club  course.  </P> <P> Parker, the defending champion, attempting to become the first player to win  back-to-back titles.  </P> <P> Parker, a 25-year-old UC Irvine graduate, said his Newport victory last year  opened a lot of doors for him.  </P> <P> It also boosted his confidence.  </P> <P> "This tournament helped me realize that I can win and that I am capable of  shooting low numbers with the pressure coming in," he said.  </P> <P> "This tournament has helped me realize that I can win. It's the best field that  I have ever been in and beat."  </P> <P> Parker, an assistant golf coach at UC Irvine, continues to compete on the  Golden State Tour; he missed qualifying for the new Hogan Tour by one shot.  </P> <P> Parker said he will try to qualify for the Canadian Tour this summer, and will  return for his third qualifying attempt on the PGA Tour in October.  </P> <P> McComish, the only person to win this tournament twice, will be back to try for  his third victory. McComish won the PGA's long-driving category in 1983 and  1987. He had his best year on the tour in 1989, winning $76,495.  </P> <P> The Newport tournament, sponsored by the 552 Club, has raised nearly $1 million  for Hoag Presbyterian Hospital in its 16-year history.  </P> <P> The first tournament, held in 1975, was known as the Crosby Southern, a second  PGA Tour event for players unable to qualify for the Crosby Clambake in Pebble  Beach.  </P> <P> There is no admission charge for the tournament, which is scheduled to conclude  Saturday.

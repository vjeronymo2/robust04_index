			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Allies enforce 'no-fly' zone over southern Iraq US and British aircraft began imposing the allied air exclusion zone over southern Iraq yesterday as Baghdad warned that it would deal with this 'aggressive, illegal action' in 'due time and with the appropriate methods'. The Pentagon said Iraq had kept its aircraft out of the zone, which runs south of the 32nd parallel. 'There have been no flights by Iraqi aircraft today below the 32-degree line. Only coalition aircraft are flying below the 32-degree line,' Pentagon spokesman Mr Bob Hall said. As tension between Iraq and the Gulf war allies grew, it emerged that the Baghdad regime is holding a second Briton, Mr Michael Wainwright, accused of illegal entry into the country. He was arrested as long ago as May after crossing from Turkey. General Brent Scowcroft, the US national security adviser, said he did not expect President Saddam Hussein to challenge the flight ban, but added: 'It's difficult to predict what Saddam Hussein may do. He has violated logic, at least our logic, many times in the past.' The US, Britain and France announced on Wednesday that no Iraqi aircraft would be permitted to fly south of the 32nd parallel, in order to protect the Shia population from further air attacks. Six British Tornado aircraft arrived yesterday in Saudi Arabia and 10 French Mirage 2000s are expected soon. The US has more than 200 aircraft in the immediate region. President George Bush has also said the US would view very seriously further large-scale Iraqi military action on the ground. 'What we are trying to do is prevent genocidal acts on the part of Saddam Hussein in compliance with UN resolution 688. It is not an attempt to break up Iraq. On the contrary, we believe strongly in the territorial integrity of Iraq,' said Gen Scowcroft. Iraq could test the exclusion zone by flying 'non-combat missions' along its border with Iran, where it says Tehran is trying to infiltrate forces, and by continuing civilian flights from Baghdad to Basra, its second largest city. Mr Zaid Haidar, Iraq's ambassador to the European Community, insisted yesterday that flights would continue over the area, but they would not be combat missions. 'We shall not attack. But if attacked, we will respond,' Mr Haidar said. 'We have civilian aircraft carrying people from Baghdad to Basra. We also have other aircraft for training and to control the border with Iran. These flights will continue.' US spokesmen have refused to provide details of the rules of engagement. But a Pentagon official said that civilian aircraft would be 'turned back'. The Pentagon says Iraq has some 60,000 troops in the south, including 2 1/2 divisions of armoured and mechanised forces and associated artillery. An official said its capabilities would be hampered without air support. Iraq warning, Page 3</p>

			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / CSA slow in responses to MPs Controversy over the operations of the Child Support Agency deepened at the weekend when it was disclosed that the organisation had recorded the worst performance of any Whitehall organisation in providing punctual answers to MPs' questions. According to official figures Ms Ros Hepplewhite, CSA chief executive, received more than 2,000 letters from MPs in the eight months after the agency was set up in April last year. She replied to only 13 per cent of those letters within the 20-day target which had been set for her by the government. Ms Hepplewhite's rate for answering correspondence, which was revealed in a written parliamentary answer from the Office of Public Service last week, was well below the performance of any other government department or agency. The Home Office recorded the next worst rate, completing 25 per cent of its replies last year within a tougher target of 15 days. But most other organisations - such as the Ministry of Defence, the Benefits Agency or the Department for Education - managed to deliver more than 70 per cent of replies within the time allowed. The CSA, which is responsible for ensuring that absent fathers provide maintenance payments to their former wives, has been the subject of more complaints in MPs' postbags than any other issue. Its poor record in collating and providing information has forced MPs to call for a 'root and branch' examination of the way the agency conducts its operations. There is particular concern that the organisation failed to meet its deadline three months ago for the publication of an annual report. The Commons social security committee has already started a new investigation into the agency's performance, and plans to publish a report in the autumn. The government has not ruled out the possibility of introducing primary legislation to reform the CSA.</p>

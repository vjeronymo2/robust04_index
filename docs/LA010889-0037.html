			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'TRADITION' AND THE WORKING WOMAN  </P> <P> For the last two decades, women have been striving to earn their due  recognition as individuals -- equal partners with men in the home and  workplace. While this change has created anxiety in many women and threatened  many men, the net result has given all of us greater options in how we choose  to live our lives.  </P> <P> I am discouraged by the recent trend in politics and advertising that professes  a return to the "traditional values." As a single parent, I value the unique  strength a family can provide, regardless of the form it takes.  </P> <P> Each family must be created by individuals willing to give equally in a manner  that best suits its circumstance. The "life style" professed by the Good  Housekeeping ad campaign dictates a stereotype that can only create unnecessary  anxiety and frustration for women, and men, too.  </P> <P> Parents and children must create their own roles in the changing family and not  give in to the simplistic wishes of the advertising industry. Change can be  positive when viewed as an opportunity rather than a threat.  </P> <P> RICHARD ALAN HALES  </P> <P> Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / When a review throws the records into a spin: Andrew Jack assesses the options for the future of Companies House, the repository of UK business information Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, will walk into his office one day next spring, and find a consultant's report on his desk. If he agrees with its findings, Companies House - part of his department - could be in private hands by the end of 1993. Some civil servants are already excited about the prospect. But its own staff and even private sector competitors view privatisation with more ambivalence. Companies House is the division within the Department of Trade and Industry which registers limited-liability companies and receives their annual accounts and returns. It has powers to bring criminal prosecutions and impose large fines to ensure that all 1m British companies file each year - and that they do so accurately and on time. It processes the information, stores it on microfiche and makes it available to the public within days. Last year it responded to more than 3m requests for data from users including banks, credit-rating companies, research organisations and individuals. Last month Mr Heseltine announced a review of 'the operation and role' of Companies House. He said it will advise on 'how its work can best be carried out in future'. Officials at the DTI have been reluctant to say more, as they prepare a tendering document expected by the end of next month. But the ministerial statement mentioned four options for consideration: full privatisation, partial privatisation, contracting out of some activities, or continuing as at present. Its statutory roles might make Companies House appear an unlikely candidate for privatisation. But it has been at the vanguard of attempts by Whitehall to increase efficiency over the past decade. Companies House was the second executive agency to be established under the Next Steps programme in 1988, which gave it considerable managerial and financial autonomy in return for meeting a number of performance targets. These included increasing the proportion of companies filing accounts on time; reducing the time it takes for the public to gain access to the documents; and cutting costs. Last year it was also made a trading fund, which effectively means it has taken over ownership of its assets from the government, and is paying for them in the form of interest on loans to the Treasury. Senior staff have wasted no time in putting these new powers to good use, and contracting out is already well in hand. The computer system, security, catering and building maintenance are all in private hands. Even a debt collection agency was hired in June to help collect fines from companies late in filing their accounts. Companies House has also embraced the market. It holds regular meetings with large users. On payment of a premium, it offers express searches and will deliver documents by courier and by fax. It is about to launch services which will allow customers to call up information on directors or outstanding loans for any company on record. A detailed invitation for external consultants to bid for the review should be ready by the end of September, with a preliminary report presenting options by early next year. The implementation of its recommendations is expected to be under way by next August. Mr David Durham, the chief executive, says the review is necessary to remove the uncertainty hovering over the Cardiff headquarters for the past few years. Given possible future changes in control and ownership of the organisation, he says he cannot offer employees or customers much long-term reassurance. 'I can't put my hand on my heart and say that if we are fully privatised we will stay in Cardiff,' he says. 'I've got no control.' Insecurity over its future helped trigger a one-day strike last month. The action also reflected the prospect of up to 80 redundancies as a result of budget cuts in the face of low demand for its services. The National Union of Civil and Public Servants (NUCPS) and the Civil and Public Services Association are concerned about their members' jobs. In the past three years, the number of full-time staff has fallen by more than 100 to just over 1,000. But Mr Kieron Hill, NUCPS regional officer for Wales, also raises a fundamental point which could concern customers: what would happen to the quality of information if Companies House was fragmented as part of the process of privatisation? Demand for the search rooms in London, for example, has declined over the past few years, and Mr Durham admits there can be no guarantee of their survival in the future. Selling the entire agency to a private operator seems unlikely, although there are precedents. In France, a company called OR Telematique has monopoly control over data input and distribution of all official information on all the country's businesses, on behalf of the state company registration office. But full privatisation would almost certainly require new legislation. There would have to be safeguards to ensure that companies continued to comply with requirements to register and file accounts; and for the public to have access to this information at affordable rates. A more likely option is that the clearly statutory services would remain in public hands, while the provision and distribution of some of the information could be handed to the private sector. The comprehensive collection of annual records held on all British companies since they were created could be tremendously attractive, particularly to credit-rating agencies and companies which specialise in corporate information. But that raises a fundamental question: how could these facilities be effectively valued? Some of the problems are highlighted in the first corporate-style set of accounts issued by Companies House in July. The figures show a commitment to repaying loans to the Treasury, which extend over periods between 15 and 25 years. There is also an annual contribution to the DTI of Pounds 17m - a sum the government would be reluctant to lose. The requirement under current legislation that Companies House must hold information on all limited companies would prove costly for a private sector operator. It could not simply select more recent data on larger concerns, which might be most profitable. It would also doubtless come under restrictions on the prices it could charge. Mr David Clark, managing director of Infocheck, a business information provider and a large user of the services, says: 'There are definitely parts of Companies House which are textbook cases for privatisation.' But, in this case, he is sceptical whether the textbook is relevant.</p>

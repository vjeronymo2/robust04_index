			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / Arts: Pilko walks and talks - Radio PILKINGTON in Kyrgyzstan has a regrettably comic sound to it. Tony Wilkinson, who travels less far but more often on Radio 4, gets a nickname, as in Wilko's Spain, also on this week. In his engaging talk last Thursday John Pilkington tried to add some fun to his chat by, for example, not cutting from his tape his fall into a snowdrift; but mostly it was purely informative. He went to Kyrgyzstan in 1991, when it was only just disengaged from the USSR and was now Kirghizia, though no one had noticed that. The more vital reform announced this week, with the rouble replaced by the som, would be noticed all right, for in Pilko's Kyrgyzstan there was already high inflation. Pilkington told us little of how he lived for the three months of his visit; but he was given sheep's milk yoghurt by a herdsman who had 100 sheep and eight children and thought everything was fine. He described the myriad new market stalls in Parliament Square in Bishkek (probably Fronze on your map). President Akayev was quoted as saying that 'the market was favourable for foreign investment', and indeed the Italians were involved in the silk mill near Ozh, on the old Silk Road. Pilkington seemed never to have had trouble finding English-speakers - evidently he has some Russian, even if not Kirghiz or Uzbek. Most of his talk was about his walking exploits, and very impressive these were. The producer was John Watkins. John Spurling's MacRune's Guevara, the second Sunday play in Radio 3's 1968 season was actually in the National's 1969 Workshop. I wrote then that it was 'as trenchant as it is comic', and I stick by that, though I have to say that this production under Jeremy Howe is not quite as comic as that of 1969 under Frank Dunlop. It is a series of parodies of Che Guevarra's exploits in current theatrical styles - orgy, five-act drama, musical, etc - written on the wall of his bedroom by MacRune, a Scottish-Irish artist, rescued by the next tenant. It is less easy to laugh at a joke second time, and I had to work harder, but it was worth another airing and was well played. The 1968 theme was also shown in some half-hour Messages. First, the message of Timothy Leary, Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out, mostly a boost for LSD, which William Burroughs approved, Alan Ginsberg did not, and in England - those were the days] - was used mostly by the middle-classes at Oxford and Cambridge. Om dealt with 'transcendental meditation'. Ginsberg was there too, but the best-known practitioners were the Beatles, with Ravi Shankar and the Maharishi. I ignored further messages, and Radio 2's Tuning In, a new series for Tuesdays, is more about the radio than other narcotics, in the 1950s yet. I meant not to write more about 1968, but I cannot miss Edward Bond's Early Morning next Sunday, which in 1968 was followed by a 'teach-in' that liberals thought prompted the end of theatre censorship, though it was mostly about John Calder's Defence of Literature, stimulated by Last Exit to Brooklyn. The theme of Radio 4's Monday Play, Grandma and Ms Chaterjee by Kitty Fitzgerald, was bizarre enough for 1968, but it dealt with working-class people of our own day. Hospital-bound Kathleen Riley (Liz Kelly) and her fellow septuagenarian Mira Chaterjee (Leena Dhringra) can induce radio sets to emit the voice of their Goddess (Julie Christie). She preaches atheism and feminism, emphasising sex; she sneers at the Bible and condemns the many deaths in the pursuit of Christianity. This distresses their everyday relatives, taints the relationship of engaged granddaughter Breda and her devout Philip, even leads to police activity. We are not expected to believe it, I hope, but at least we may conclude that the Goddess's principles are for the general good. Kate Rowland directed.</p>

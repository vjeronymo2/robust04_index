			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Labour leadership election set for July after NEC compromise THE OPENING shots in the Labour leadership battle were fired yesterday as Mr Bryan Gould found himself with just 12 weeks to halt the formidable bandwagon rolling for his rival Mr John Smith. As both men declared their candidacies, the party's national executive agreed a compromise July 18 date for the election's conclusion. Minutes later, Mr John Prescott, the Labour transport spokesman, became the third candidate to enter the race by declaring his bid for the deputy leadership, a post also being contested by Mr Gould. The NEC's decision, reached by a 15 to 10 vote after a two-hour debate, was reluctantly accepted by Mr Gould's supporters. They had been hoping to maximise the period of debate in the belief that a longer campaign would increase the shadow environment secretary's chances of winning round the undecided. Mr Neil Kinnock, the outgoing leader who had wanted a late June election, said the July date was acceptable. But supporters of a motion by leftwingers for an October election at the party conference said their 18 to 7 defeat was a victory for Mr Smith and the party's right wing. However, remarks from Mr Bill Jordan, the engineers' union leader, that balloting members on the election would be 'a waste of time and money' looked certain to spark fresh controversy. At their opening news conferences, both Mr Smith and Mr Gould had called for the fullest possible participation of unionists, including balloting wherever feasible, to complement voting by MPs and constituency parties. Mr Smith used his campaign launch to project his candidacy as the steady continuation of the party and policy reform process undertaken by Mr Kinnock. Arguing for policies to convince voters that prosperity is best advanced by a government which works for the welfare of the whole community, he said: 'Modern government should be pluralistic, decentralised and should be underpinned by recognition of individual rights.' In an effort to present himself as the candidate for change, Mr Gould insisted that the party needed 'a period of serious reflection about what went wrong and what needs to be done'. Promising a 'positive and radical' agenda, he clearly sought to portray Mr Smith as the 'steady as she goes' candidate who would not seek fundamental shifts in policy. 'One more heave may have been the right response to our 1987 defeat,' he said. 'It is a wholly inadequate response to our 1992 defeat. We cannot simply change the face at the top and expect to win in 1996 on the programme on which we lost in 1992.' There were also clear differences between the two men on economic policy. Mr Gould said it was now necessary to discuss broader economic issues beyond the 'very narrow terrain' of tax policy, such as Britain's weighting in the European exchange rate mechanism. Mr Smith has always insisted that a Labour government would not tamper with sterling's exchange rate.</p>

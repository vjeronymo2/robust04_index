			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Rexmore declines to Pounds 0.9m REXMORE, the Liverpool-based upholstery, textile and timber supplier, blamed the 'lack of activity' in the furniture manufacturing and building trades for a downturn in annual profits. Despite a promising start, the year to March 28 ended with profits of Pounds 931,000 (Pounds 1m) pre-tax, on turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 43.4m). Interest charges amounted to Pounds 916,000 (Pounds 1.07m). The costs of withdrawing from the loss-making Letherens business, along with losses on the sale of Rexmore's stake in Rosebys, resulted in an extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.66m. However, the contract furnishings side achieved record profits of Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.39m). After a transfer from reserves of Pounds 1.29m, earnings emerged at 4.36p (4.75p). The final dividend is reduced to 1.05p for a 1.75p (2.25p) total.</p>

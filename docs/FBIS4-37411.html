			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: Informed U.S. circles have cast doubt  on the possibility of U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher  making a new visit to the Middle East this week, attributing  this to insufficient signs of progress in the regional peace  process.    It is known that such signs should be shown by Israel. Syria  has frequently proven its real desire to achieve peace. It has  constantly worked for the success of the U.S. and the  international efforts, as part of the Madrid conference and  according to its established bases.    What has happened so far, however, conflicts with these  bases. The just and comprehensive peace to which the U.S.  administration committed itself has become separate partial  deals. The Washington talks were stymied in favor of secret  talks here and there. In addition, the Security Council  resolutions, which are supposed to organize the peace process,  were deliberately ignored. Israel continued to intensify the  situation in southern Lebanese areas. It did not hide the fact  that its escalating attacks are intended to terrorize Lebanon  and pressure Syria.    Under these circumstances, observers naturally wonder about  the promised U.S. role. Washington is supposed to be the first  to defend its initiative and adhere to its commitments, and,  consequently, halt the continued Israeli sabotage of the peace  process, in accordance with the agreed bases.    Politicians and observers know it is impossible to achieve  peace in the Middle East without Syria, and that the attempts to  circumvent Syria and ignore its basic role in the region will  lead the peace process to a real impasse. While it is in the  interest of the Middle East to achieve a state of peace that  gives it an opportunity to dedicate its resources to  development, it is definitely in the interest of the United  States that the aspired peace is firm and well-established,  rather than a mere truce that cannot withstand events and  developments.    A firm and well-established peace requires a minimum level  of  justice, fairness, and honesty. Syria has always made it clear  that Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan, southern Lebanon,  and the other occupied territories is an inevitable prelude to  the establishment of peace. The Security Council resolutions  actually stipulate that Israel should withdraw and that the  Israeli measures of annexation, Judaization, and settlements are  null and void.    The U.S. initiative itself provides for exchanging land for  peace. Israel, however, has thus far refused to commit itself  to full withdrawal from the occupied territories. It has only  hinted at the possibility of a partial withdrawal from the  Golan. It also announces daily that it has annexed Jerusalem  once and for all, in addition to important parts of the West  Bank, under the guise of a greater Jerusalem. To prove its  rejection of the substance of the peace process, namely,  returning the occupied territories, Israel shells southern  Lebanon every day and threatens to escalate its acts of  aggression.    Saving the peace process from deliberate Israeli sabotage is  a U.S. and international responsibility. The United States has  the clout it will take to implement the Security Council  resolutions. Without doing so, peace in the Middle East will  remain a deferred project. The only way to achieve peace is a  daring and decisive international position that removes Israeli  belligerence from the region's atmosphere.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A spokesman for our country's Foreign Ministry  announced today that the first secretary -- the second-ranking  official of the British Embassy in Tehran -- must leave Iran  within a month because of actions and behavior contrary to  diplomatic principles and contact with terrorist groups opposed  to the Islamic Republic of Iran.    Denying a claim by the British Foreign Office on the  distribution of forged documents by an Iranian diplomat  regarding British activities and stance on Bosnia-Herzegovina,  he said: British policies on events in Bosnian-Herzegovina are  so obvious that there is no need to divulge them to  international public opinion and the world's Muslims.    He added: British Foreign Office Minister Douglas Hogg's  views and the raising of groundless allegations against the  Islamic Republic of Iran come at a time when known international  terrorists -- such as the Hypocrites [Mojahedin Khalq  Organization] -- while being active in Britain, make use of that  country's facilities and resources for the propagation of  terrorism.    Concluding, the Foreign Ministry spokesman said: It is a  source of great regret that Britain embarked on installing  listening devices in the Islamic Republic of Iran's Embassy  contrary to international law, and in response to its illegal  act resorts to the reiteration of its futile allegations against  Iran.</p>

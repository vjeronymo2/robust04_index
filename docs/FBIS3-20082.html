			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Kuwait, 26 Mar--Dr. Mulack Gunter, Germany's  ambassador to Kuwait, has confirmed that his country's embassy  in Baghdad would remain closed until Iraq applies all UN  Security Council's resolutions regarding the respect of the  State of Kuwait's sovereignty and independence. [passage omitted]    He expressed his wish that Kuwait would channel its  investments to German industry, in particular, and to the new  regions in Germany after the unification of the east and the  west, which would allow Kuwait to contribute to modern German  technology and to benefit from it.    The ambassador stressed that economic relations between  Kuwait and Germany were developing steadily and are being  strengthened in both directions, the proof being the various  Kuwaiti investments in Germany.    The ambassador has also denied that his country was arming  fundamentalists or extremists and said that those allegations  were groundless. He added that some extremists and  fundamentalists are based in Germany as residents and used to be  involved in some political activities, just like Kurds, Turks,  and some Palestinians.</p>

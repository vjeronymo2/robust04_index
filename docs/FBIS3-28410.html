			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chin Chang-uk from Washington] </F>   [Text] The WASHINGTON POST reported on 7 February: The  U.S. Government seems to believe that its efforts to resolve the  North Korean nuclear issue have indeed failed. Accordingly, the  U.S. Department of Defense has already instructed U.S. reserve  troops on its mainland to prepare for participation in the Team  Spirit exercise.    The paper reported on 7 February that the time for  negotiations to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue have  likely run out, and that the U.S. Government's attitude  indicates there are some changes in its position, which has so  far expected the nuclear issue to be resolved by diplomatic  efforts.    The paper reported that the U.S. Department of Defense had  ordered an additional 1,000 U.S. reserve troops to report to  U.S. Forces stationed in the ROK if the North Korean nuclear  issue is not resolved before 21 February, when the International  Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] Board of Governors meeting is  scheduled.    The paper reported: IAEA authorities in Vienna have said  that they are getting tired of holding negotiations with North  Korea regarding inspection conditions and that they expect the  IAEA Board of Governors to refer the North Korean nuclear issue  to the UN Security Council.    The paper also reported that the White House would soon  determine and announce the deployment of Patriot missiles to  U.S. Forces in the ROK.    The Team Spirit joint military exercise, which has been  conducted by the ROK and the United States since 1976, is  prepared for in early January every year. In early March, field  mobile exercises of the Team Spirit exercise are usually  conducted. Up to the present time, however, the ROK and the  United States have not prepared for the exercise as a result of  nuclear negotiations between the IAEA and North Korea.</p>

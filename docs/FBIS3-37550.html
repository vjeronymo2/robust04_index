Shaymiyev said he was receiving numerous telegrams and phone  calls from representatives of Tatar diasporas in various regions  of Russia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).  They note that the Tatar population there was faced with  certain problems and had definite fears, which have now been  dispelled. At the same time, the Tatar president said he was  disturbed by the fact that "feeble voices", as he put it, have  appeared in the Russian State Duma and in Tatarstan, protesting  against the treaty. Such people, in his opinion, are coming out  not only against this historical document, but also against the  peoples of Russia and Tatarstan.    Replying to those who demand self-isolation, President  Shaymiyev said: "Sovereignty means self-restriction. It is not  without reason that the former members of the Soviet Union,  which have gained sovereignty, are now voluntarily restricting  it and asking to be admitted to the CIS. Objective factors call  for economic and political integration. The main task is to  safeguard civil peace and tranquility in the republic and to  concentrate all the available forces on construction. The first  action will be to actively take part in the repeated elections  to the Russian parliament, which will be held in Tatarstan on  March 13. [no closing quotation marks as received]</p>

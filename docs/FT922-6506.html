			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Daiei buys stake in Recruit DAIEI, Japan's largest supermarket chain, will acquire a one-third stake in Recruit from Mr Hiromasa Ezoe, the former chairman who was at the centre of the 1988 bribery scandal involving the publishing and information company, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The stake was sold for an estimated Y50bn (Dollars 384m) which will be used to restructure the business. The real estate and finance subsidiaries face heavy debts due to sharp falls in land and stock prices. The purchase will give Daiei, which is based in western Japan and has been hindered in its expansion into the Tokyo area due to higher land prices, access to Recruit's properties. It will also allow Daiei, which controls 20 per cent of Japan's supermarket trade, to diversify.</p>

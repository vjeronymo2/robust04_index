			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Red is go as a gamble pays off - ShareLink as it prepares its first results WHEN THE traffic lights turn red on the dealing floor at ShareLink Investment Services, the traders know it is time to step up their pace. The wall-mounted lights signal the calls queueing up for the Birmingham-based company's telephone dealing service. Green allows some of the 200 operators to linger over their transactions; amber means it's time to wind up; if all the lights turn red - get off the line because one of ShareLink's 1,500 new customers a week is waiting to get through. Business has continued to grow rapidly since its Pounds 42m flotation two months ago, reflecting both the buoyancy of the equity market and ShareLink's broadening range of services. From a no-frills telephone stock brokerage service, it has expanded into self-select Peps, traded options, and a North American stocks service. The company, currently preparing its first interim results since flotation, predicts the figures next month will justify its decision to look for additional trading premises in the Midlands and consider outlets in continental Europe. Its shares, floated at 250p, closed yesterday at 335p. Growing demand for ShareLink's services - running currently at 2m calls and up to 3m postal transactions a year - is partly because of the reluctance of many small investors to deal with traditional brokers, according to Mr David Jones, the group's founder and chief executive. Mr Jones, a miner's son who had no experience of financial services before setting up the company in 1987, hit on the idea of a no-frills dealing operation because of his own fears of being over-charged by City brokers. 'I had a couple of thousand pounds to invest but was petrified of ringing a stockbroker. I thought there must be an easier way to make a low-cost transaction. This is it.' The former British Telecom executive scans his main dealing floor in Birmingham with some satisfaction. When the clearing banks rejected his business plan, he went ahead without them - launching the service with management backing from his old employers and finance raised by brokers Albert E Sharp. The gamble paid off. Set up on a Pounds 1m budget, the company exploited a market vacated when several City firms withdrew from private client services in the wake of Big Bang. That market was boosted by customers attracted to equities by the large privatisation issues. Last year Mr Jones felt ready to lead a management buy-out in which he remained the majority shareholder. The traffic lights, meanwhile, continued to turn red. And this summer, buoyed by figures showing it had captured 10 per cent of all UK transactions by volume, ShareLink floated. Coming to the stock market has been a lucrative transaction for the founder. He has cashed in shares worth Pounds 1.8m, while retaining a 14 per cent stake worth Pounds 7.7m. Although the management team are pleased with the performance of turnover of Pounds 14.3m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.1m in the year to March 31, the group's rise to its present cruising altitude has not been without turbulence. Public appetite for equities was severely dented by the stock market crash in October 1987, undermining the private client business. Inefficiencies also emerged as the managers tried to co-ordinate a fledgling share service based at three different sites. Increasingly aware of the risks in its dependency on execution-only trading, the company has also begun to diversify. The workforce, meanwhile, has been cut by more than 50 per cent from 422 in the year to April 1992 to about 200 at present. Today, customers calling to buy shares are put through to a central dealing floor which used to be the home of the regional blood donor service. The newly offered services are catching on with ShareLink handling more than Pounds 100m in self-select Peps and claiming 25 per cent of the retail market for traded options. Since flotation the company has also put increased emphasis on its distributor services for other financial institutions. More than 500 organisations such as Allied Dunbar and Harrods Bank have signed contracts to process their share trading through the Birmingham dealing room, giving ShareLink some guaranteed income in the event of a decline in its private client trade. The growth of third party contracts, now accounting for 20 per cent of the business, follows the success of its 1989 link with Abbey National, the company's first outside deal. Wholesaling for institutions was boosted further at the time of the flotation when Halifax joined the list of companies using the service. The rapid rise of the company must be galling to some brokers. But one element of its success is its ability to set itself apart from the City, avoiding traditional elements of the Square Mile's expertise and the overheads that go with them. ShareLink minimises its risk by leaving the decision-making to its clients. Its traders offer no recommendations on when to buy and sell, they simply execute telephone instructions in return for a commission. The profits lie in the average Pounds 100 annual commission per customer. The company's good fortune is that few competitors have emerged to its telephone-based operations. The clearing banks pose a challenge but share dealing remains peripheral to their main business; and many large brokers prefer to concentrate on more lucrative institutional transactions than private clients. Mr Jones, a psychology graduate, believes he knows what ShareLink customers have in mind as they look for new ways of investing. To that end, ShareLink is spending almost Pounds 3m on new software and additional premises to make the service speedier - ensuring fewer callers wait for the lights to turn red before they are answered. During the sale of the third tranche of British Telecom shares earlier this year, when ShareLink handled applications worth Pounds 120m, the company pioneered touch-tone dealing allowing customers to buy and sell using the buttons on their telephone. The service uses 'talking computers' to handle orders at the best market price at the time of the call. The chief executive, who had never clapped eyes on a share certificate until ShareLink had been trading for six weeks, admits such innovations are regarded as somewhat vulgar by traditional brokers. But he says he's happy to be regarded as the B&amp;Q of share trading. 'There's Pounds 20bn stashed under the beds in this country. I'm after that business,' he says.</p>

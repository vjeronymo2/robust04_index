			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Electrolux As Europe's largest manufacturer of fridges and washing machines, Electrolux is a sensitive barometer of consumer confidence across the continent. Judging by yesterday's annual results, Europe's shoppers are a pretty dispirited bunch. Demand was especially weak in the Nordic countries and Spain. Germany remained resilient but has now begun to soften. There is no sign of improvement in the UK. This bleak outlook prompted Electrolux to halve its dividend after persevering for two years with an uncovered pay-out. Its shares fell 6 per cent as a result. The news struck an ominous note for other Swedish industrial groups at the start of their reporting season. Dividend cuts from other groups, such as SKF and Stora, are now taken as read. Electrolux can do little to improve its lot. It has already extensively rationalised its operations and cut its workforce by 10 per cent. Its fortunes depend upon a pick-up in demand. The one bright spot is the US, but Electrolux has a comparatively small share of that market and is burdened by expensive dollar borrowings. The better corporate news from Sweden will come from the likes of Asea, Ericsson and Astra, which operate in more resilient markets and may benefit more from the krona's devaluation.</p>

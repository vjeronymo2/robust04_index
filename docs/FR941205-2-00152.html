			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> Note: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  This criterion is generally more restrictive than Criterion 4. The existing condition must pose a serious and immediate threat to the health or welfare of the target population. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (i)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Criterion 9_Supports Other Federal or State Programs Being Undertaken in the Community or Deals with the Adverse Impact of Another Recent Federal or State Action. The Other Federal or State Program or Action Must Be of Substantial Size or Impact in the Community in Relation to the Proposed Program. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The application must contain a complete description of the Federal or State Program(s) (excluding other CDBG Programs) which currently are underway, or a complete description of the adverse impact of a recent Federal or State action (e.g. the closing of a military base). A Federal or State program or action not yet initiated will be considered only where the application provides documentation establishing the certainty of, and the approximate commencement date of, the described program or action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed CDBG Program must demonstrate clearly the magnitude of the effect of the Federal or State Program or action on the community. The degree to which the proposed CDBG Program will support the Federal or State Program, and/or the extent to which the adverse impact of Federal or State action will be mitigated, also must be demonstrated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the above, the nature and costs of the proposed activities will be considered in determining the degree of impact. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (j)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Criterion 10_Supports Energy Production or Conservation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This criterion will be judged, and points will be awarded, based upon the community's ability to demonstrate that the proposed program will support energy production or conservation. Applicants are urged to develop innovative approaches toward addressing energy needs with Small Cities CDBG funds. Energy considerations can be a factor in most activities proposed by smaller communities. Attention should focus on new methods of producing energy or conserving energy where possible. In developing and evaluating proposals, there are a number of energy aspects to consider. The following factors will be considered: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Cost efficiency_Relationship of dollar amount to benefits to be derived. The applicant must document estimates of energy costs which are to be saved as a result of the proposed program. The proposed program should make maximum use of non-CDBG resources as well as CDBG funds. Appropriate documentation must be provided to ensure that the proposal is economically feasible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The extent to which the proposed program will support other programs currently aimed at addressing energy production or conservation needs of the community. From a management standpoint, proposed projects should be consistent with needs or objectives of any plan for energy management or conservation. Applicants should pursue the availability of other resources from Federal or State energy related programs. The degree of commitment of other resources should be established. State energy offices, private as well as municipally-owned utility companies, and home heating oil companies may be appropriate entities to be involved in the development and planning of proposals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _The application should address whether the project is based on appropriate technology, materials and methods to maximize energy conservation. Engineering reports or studies would be appropriate evidence to support the overall feasibility of the project. The conversion of existing facilities, where appropriate, rather than proposing new construction may be more economical. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _While housing rehabilitation programs which include weatherization/winterization components will be considered, they generally will not be presumed as addressing a severe need unless unique conditions are specifically identified and cost savings are properly documented. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- The upper chamber of the  Russian parliament approved a federal law on Tuesday fixing the  limit for foreign loans at 4.7 billion us dollars this year.  The limit for Russian state credits to other countries has been  set at 400 million dollars in 1994.    Chairman of the Finance and Budget Committee of the  Federation Council Nikolay Gonchar commented that the law is  aimed to avert a further increase of the Russian foreign debt  which exceeded 80 billion dollars by the beginning of 1994.</p>

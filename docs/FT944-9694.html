			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / Yeltsin sees greater friction with US President Boris Yeltsin yesterday forecast new friction between Russia and a US in which the Republican party was ascendant. He also warned of an increased nuclear threat from developing countries, scolded his military chiefs for inefficiency and told his prime minister not to cut too much from armed forces funds. In a wide-ranging series of remarks to military commanders, the Russian president sounded a more bellicose note than he has before, though his speech was cast in the form of requiring his forces to be on guard against an increasingly dangerous world. In his first public comment on last week's US elections which returned Republican majorities in the Senate and the House of Representatives, Mr Yeltsin said that 'after the victory of the conservatives in the US mid-term elections we can expect a certain toughening of the US stand in foreign policy and military issues. We should acquire contacts with the Republicans, to balance our relations'. Remarking that the 'international situation is quite unstable' - a marked longer had any enemies - Mr Yeltsin said that Russia could find itself drawn into political, ethnic and economic conflicts. 'There is only one solution: to increase the readiness of its armed forces,' he said. He told Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, who also attended the meeting with the commanders, to ensure that the military had enough funds so that 'they are not pushed down the road of commerce - they have their own objectives. You gave your word to guarantee the financing of the army and I believe you'. His remarks appeared to provide a rationale for widespread claims that military commanders are engaging in illegal commercial operations. The Interfax news agency quoted him as saying that 385,000 personnel had been cut this year making an official total of 1,917,400 under arms. The aim was to reduce the military to 1.7m by January 1996. He said that the military leadership, headed by General Pavel Grachev, the defence minister, 'does not fully carry out my orders to tighten military discipline, law and order'. Gen Grachev has been under pressure from all parties in the state duma (lower house of parliament) to resign following corruption allegations in the high command. So far, the president has protected him. However, Mr Yeltsin's remarks came as Mr Sergei Yushenkov, chairman of the duma's defence committee, announced that it would take a vote of confidence in the minister on Thursday.

			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Directors attack EC policy on jobs THE INSTITUTE of Directors has launched a fresh attack against EC social policy, describing it as a 'misdirected and damaging job-destroying machine'. In a submission to the European Commission the IoD says that the EC's social chapter and social action programme are based on 'outdated and undemocratic collectivist policies geared to the rights of organised labour and driven by the self-interest of European trade unions'. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, called for EC member countries to be 'set free from the shackles of social policy, which makes the labour market inflexible and European business uncompetitive'. Mr Morgan added: 'The biggest problem in Europe today is 17m unemployed. The focus of future EC social and employment policy must be to get these people back into work, an objective which will not be achieved by Europe's anti-employment laws and an even heavier burden of regulation and social cost on the job creators.' The IoD's alternative charter concentrates on the rights and responsibilities of the individual at work, rather than on collective rights. Its proposals include performance-related pay and employee involvement. 'The provisions of the charter would be left to national governments or individual employers and employees to decide, free from Brussels diktat,' Mr Morgan added.

			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Labour flirts with reform LABOUR'S coy flirtation with electoral reform made a fleeting appearance at the party's triumphant post-elections press conference yesterday amid fresh speculation that it may have a walk-on part in the coming general election. Mr Jack Cunningham, Lab-our campaigns co-ordinator, who is known to favour reform, dismissed the suggestion that the party might hint at support for a new voting system for the Commons before a general election is called. He agreed it was an important issue. 'To say it is just mutterings and going to go away . . . neither is true,' he said. 'It is much more important than mutterings on the side.' Mr Bryan Gould, the environment spokesman, said that only the Tories indulged in the 'short-term opportunism and cynicism' of shifting policies to gain electoral advantage. Such a comment from one who is sceptical of the benefits of proportional representation appeared to confirm the view among some Labour supporters that electoral advantage could be gleaned from dangling the PR carrot. At present, a Labour working party is examining all the electoral options for the European parliament, the Commons and the proposed assemblies for Scotland, Wales, and the English regions. The exercise was agreed at the last party conference after delegates threw out a proposal by the National Executive to confine its studies to systems for the Euro-elections and planned assemblies. A preliminary report is due in the summer. Opponents of change say adopting reform would show a potentially damaging and defeatist lack of faith in the party's capacity to win a clear majority in Westminster. Mr Roy Hattersley, the party deputy leader, also argues that abandoning first-past-the-post voting for the Commons would condemn Labour to coalition government. Yet some Labour PR supporters believe that the possibility of electoral reform should be mooted in the manifesto. That, they argue, would be attractive to its proponents and might undermine the Liberal Democrat vote. Ten years ago the subject was ideologically unacceptable. Now, it is the centre of a vigorous debate, with many left-wing factions urging outright backing for change. This week the Labour Co-ordinating Committee, a soft-left lobby group that often enjoys the tacit blessing of the Walworth Road leadership, came out openly for a new voting system for the lower house.</p>

			<p>931118 FT  18 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco sees nickel market heading for deficit EVIDENCE IS building that points to a big cut in Russian nickel production and exports. This has lead Inco of Canada, the largest western producer, to claim that nickel supply and demand are virtually in balance this year and the market is heading for a deficit in 1994. Sumitomo Metal, Japan's leading nickel producer, has publicly predicted that Russian nickel exports to the west will plunge by 35 per cent to 85,000 tonnes this year from an estimated 130,000 tonnes in 1992. Mr Mars Altibaev, logistics manager for Norilsk of Russia, the world's biggest producer, joined the debate yesterday when he told a Metal Bulletin conference in Florida that his country's nickel exports in 1993 and 1994 would be no more than 90,000 tonnes each year. He suggested that Norilsk's output this year would be at least 20,000 tonnes below recent western estimates of 230,000 tonnes. The International Nickel Study Group estimates that world nickel production fell by 70,900 tonnes or 11 per cent in the first nine months of 1993, to 581,300 tonnes, and that most of the drop occurred in the Confederation of Independent States. The INSG calculated production in the CIS plunged by more than 30 per cent, by 57,000 to 126,000 tonnes, in the nine months. Inco 'guestimates' that Russian production will be flat at about 180,000 tonnes in 1994 and that in the first quarter of next year world demand will exceed supply by 50m lb (22,686 tonnes). 'I believe the stories we hear from all quarters, including Norilsk, of reduced Russian production are correct,' says Mr Peter Salathiel, Inco's executive vice president of marketing. 'Mining problems abound, essential equipment and supplies seem to be lacking. The result is an involuntary production cut of truly staggering proportions - some 120,000 tonnes or 265m lb in two years. As for Russian exports, Mr Salathiel suggests that supply to the west of 'backdoor' - or illegally exported - nickel has dropped sharply this year since Norilsk took over from the state the allocation system for Russian consumers. Previously some customers were exporting nickel illegally in order to survive a big fall in domestic consumption. 'Knowing its customers, Norilsk has been better able to match deliveries with customer requirements and hence the supply of backdoor nickel has been sharply reduced,' says Mr Salathiel. He suggests that total imports of Russian nickel to the west will fall by 40,000 tonnes to a 'miserly' 80,000 tonnes next year.</p>

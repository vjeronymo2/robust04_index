			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eric Zemmour: "Balladur, or the Art of </F> Weathering a Self-Inflicted Controversy"]    [Text] The prime minister should not suffer too much from  the new political situation, even though all observers agree  that, for the first time, he has made a mistake. There are even  indications that he may end up in a better position for the  presidential election.    Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators having taken to the  streets clamoring for [Education Minister] Bayrou's resignation;  a piece of legislation hastily shoved into a closet... The  analogy between Alain Devaquet and Francois Bayrou does no go  beyond this point. First of all, because the political climate  is not the same; because the demonstration on Sunday [16  January], although impressive, remained good-natured; because  the Socialist leaders shrewdly downplayed its political  significance in order to reap larger benefits; and because --  with the exception of Patrick Devedjian [Rally for the Republic,  RPR, MP], who wondered aloud whether Mr. Bayrou might resign  from his position as National Education minister -- the majority  remained united, whatever it may have to say privately about Mr.  Bayrou's method and mistakes. And there was no Malik Oussekine!  In any case, Francois Bayrou did not flinch. "He who is prone  to being seasick, should not be a sailor," was his rather  gallant answer. And he accepted Michel Rocard's proposal to call  for a national forum on education, which he prefers to call  "assizes," in order to have everyone concerned talk about the  future of the educational system.    It is clear, however, that in the negotiations that begin at  rue de Grenelle [Education Ministry] today, the minister is in a  weaker position in front of teachers' unions, which he rather  hastily considered to be ruined by their schism. With a view to  next week's roundtable at Matignon [prime minister's office],  the unions already have been asking for a five-year programming  law. Money, always more money... In such a context, Francois  Bayrou will be hard put to push forward his pet project: the  reform of the single college...    Furthermore, there is no definite indication that Edouard  Balladur would have given him the go-ahead. One will remember  that the Devaquet affair had terminally bogged down the Chirac  government's reform machinery, which had previously been going  full speed ahead. Comparing Balladur's current policy with  Chirac's boils down to comparing a waltz to hard rock. And yet,  with the attempted revision of the Falloux Act, Balladur had  indulged a little, so as to satisfy both his more conservative  electors and the majority leaders who never failed to remind him  of this electoral promise. The fact that Edouard Balladur made  the final decision to revise the Falloux Act on the very day the  GATT agreement was signed is no coincidence. It may be due to a  kind of euphoria, as Raymond Barre puts it.    One may be assured that the prime minister will not twice  let  himself be blinded by pride. And that he will even find in his  disappointment an additional reason to hold on to his certainty  -- repeated over and over -- that in the excessively fragile  French society, where passions may flare up at any time, any  reform must be slow, explained, and accepted by all.    This will inevitably make it more difficult to reform the  social security system, a task the government has been getting  ready to tackle. After Sunday's demonstration, one may wonder  under which shape Balladur -- who no doubt remembers the  disastrous impact of the 1987 Seguin reform -- will let it come  out.    Concurrently, Balladur is taking other, more political  risks.  His consensus-oriented policy, based on negotiation, expert  consultations, and snail-paced reform, will increase the  impatience of those who, at the UDF [Union for French Democracy]  and the RPR, already charge him with being "Rocardized." In  addition, the failed attempt to revise the Falloux Act gives  Jacques Chirac new ammunition when he claims, much to Edouard  Balladur's irritation, that real change can only take place  after the 1995 presidential election.  <H5>  First Ballot </H5>   A presidential election for which Balladur's mistake has not  disqualified him, however -- another major difference with the  Devaquet affair. The prime minister, as usual, has made sure he  stood on safe ground, even though he did appear on TF1 [TV  network] to defend the government position. It is worth noting  that the demonstrators were asking for the resignation of  Bayrou, not Balladur. The most recent opinion polls indicate  that his fight with a newly combative left has increased his  influence within the RPR electorate.    And according to a Sofres poll to be released today, he  would  win a presidential election in the first round of voting! This  is what a UDF elected representative calls the "Balladur  mystery."    And this mystery is not about to fade away. Indeed, as  Balladur watchers have pointed out, should [Socialist Party  Secretary General] Michel Rocard's chances in the presidential  race improve, thanks to the mobilization of the left in favor of  anticlerical values, the majority would be constrained to unite  behind a single candidate.    In other words, an RPR candidate who is not only accepted  but  happily backed by the UDF: Edouard Balladur. On the other  hand, Chirac supporters would rather consider that the rebirth  of the left is bound to deflate Balladur's popularity ratings  due to his image, which is much more consensual than Chirac's.  Provided the current crisis -- which brings back the  traditional left-right rift within French society -- does not  provide Edouard Balladur with the party leader profile he  absolutely needs in order to become a genuine presidential  candidate instead of a mere politician with stellar opinion  ratings, not unlike [Social Affairs Minister] Simone Veil, for  example. Should this happen, the mystery would deepen further  still...</p>

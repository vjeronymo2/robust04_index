			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Science through the looking glass: The Nature of Things Step with Alice through the looking glass and glance around the mirror image world. Though everything looks familiar, the air is full of strange and exotic scents. Peel an orange - it smells and tastes of lemon. Chew some spearmint gum - instead of a minty tang, a caraway flavour fills your mouth. Then sip some cool fresh milk . . . and spit it out quickly; the taste is quite disgusting. Alice was quite right to warn Kitty: 'Perhaps looking-glass milk isn't good to drink.' Lewis Carroll wrote Through the Looking Glass soon after Victorian scientists discovered that most organic chemicals - the building blocks of life - exist in identical mirror image forms. Like a pair of right and left hands, they cannot be superimposed. The critical observation had been made in 1848 by Louis Pasteur while drinking red wine. He analysed the crystals of tartaric acid deposited on the surface of the bottle and managed to separate them into two mirror image forms. One rotated a beam of polarised light in a clockwise direction and the other turned it anticlockwise (this 'optical activity' is the classic test for chiral chemicals). Pasteur went on to make a prescient comment: 'The universe is dissymmetrical . . . life is dominated by dissymetrical actions. I can foresee that all living species are primordially, in their structure, in their external forms, functions of cosmic dissymetry.' Dissymetry has become an established field of science, under the name of chirality (from the Greek word for hand). As scientists discovered the molecular structure of life, they came to realise that almost all biological processes are chiral. The chemicals that make up living cells are made up of one or other of the two possible mirror image forms, but not both; for example all natural amino acids, the building blocks of proteins, are left-handed. Many scientists have reflected on the origins of biological dissymetry, without coming to any clear conclusion. No one really knows what first skewed amino acids in the left-handed direction. But Pasteur was probably right in holding 'cosmic dissymetry' responsible. Indeed the answer to chirality - as to many other scientific mysteries - is probably hidden in the first few micro-seconds of the universe after its formation in the Big Bang, when our familiar laws of symmetry did not apply. Whatever may have happened billions of years ago, it is clear now that our cells respond differently to each configuration of any chiral molecule. Take for instance the molecule called carvone; its left-handed form produces a caraway flavour while the right-handed image gives spearmint. Over the past decade or so, chiral chemistry has begun to move from academic research into industry. Its biggest impact will be in pharmaceuticals. Ordinary chemical reactions produce a 50:50 mixture of mirror image molecules. Frequently, however, only one is a beneficial drug; the other is at best inactive and may be positively harmful. A tragic example was thalidomide: pharmacists discovered too late that its left-handed form caused birth defects, while the right-handed molecule gave the desired sedative effect. Under pressure from regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration, the pharmaceutical industry is quickly building up an array of techniques for making pure left or right-handed drugs. As well as developing entirely new chiral chemicals, drug companies are examining well established medicines that are currently made as mixtures, to see whether they would benefit from reformulation in pure form. The most ambitious chiral synthesis so far is the creation of an artificial protein from 99 right-handed amino acids at Scripps Research Institute in California. The protein is the mirror image of a natural enzyme found in HIV, the Aids virus. Creation of a whole mirror image virus might be possible within a few decades. The prospect is intriguing but not alarming, such an organism could not survive outside the laboratory. It would starve in the real world, as surely as Alice would have if she had lingered long through the looking glass.</p>

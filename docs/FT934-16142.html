			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Pirate decoders pose threat to satellite broadcasters SATELLITE Television broad-casters in the US and Britain and Hollywood studios are joining forces to fight a potentially serious threat to their booming business from pirates. The Motion Picture Export Association of America, which represents the Hollywood studios, and satellite broadcasters have produced a draft directive they wish the European Commission to adopt to outlaw piracy throughout the Community. Manufacturing and distributing unauthorised decoders is a criminal offence in the UK and France, but not in most EC countries. Unauthorised decoders which unlock the scrambled pictures on subscription channels are being openly advertised in magazines throughout Europe and are now available in the UK. The increasing threat from the satellite pirates comes only weeks after British Sky Broadcasting launched its multi-channel subscription package in the UK with a considerable fanfare orchestrated by Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation. The Financial Times has tracked the pirates and their unauthorised 'smart cards' that unlock the BSkyB movie and sports channels from Bochum in Germany to the village of Bally-egan in Co Offaly in Ireland and on to Warrington in Cheshire where the cards are being openly advertised for sale. Mr David Lyons, who runs Satellite Decoder Systems, which operates in both Ballyegan and Warrington, last night demonstrated one of his cards in the Coachman's Inn pub outside Dublin airport. The picture quality was indistinguishable over a 40-minute period from that provided by the Sky card which is normally used in the bar's television system. Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of BSkyB, last night conceded that 'obviously there are going to be attempts at piracy from time-to-time'. 'BSkyB will use all methods legal and technological to counter this problem,' Mr Barlow added. BSkyB is a consortium in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times, has a stake. Mr Lyons has said at times the cards come from Germany at others that Ireland is the nerve centre. The satellite industry believes the cards are being made in Bochum in Germany. Mr John Spencer, UK marketing director of GI, the US electronics company who has been monitoring the pirate decoders believes that the VideoCrypt being used by BSkyB is being routinely broken by the pirates. But in what is developing into a cat-and-mouse game with millions of pounds at stake BSkyB is changing its signal when it thinks the threat from a particular illicit card has become unacceptable.

			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / Brussels warns post services: Pricing tactics anger couriers SEVEN European postal services, including the British Post Office, came under pressure from the European Commission yesterday to improve the fairness and transparency of their charges, following complaints that they are stifling competition from private operators. Brussels said it had opened a formal inquiry into allegations that national postal services in Germany, Belgium, France, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland and Britain were deliberately hampering the 'remailing' of bulk mail by private couriers. The move comes before EC telecommunications ministers next month discuss the outcome of talks on the Commission's outline plan for further liberalisation of EC postal services.

In particular, the IECC said national administrations had begun to take into account each item, rather than charge for the weight of the whole delivery. It also said letters posted outside the country where the sender was based were often returned or subjected to additional charges. Mr Karel Van Miert, EC competition commissioner, said he hoped the complaint could be resolved in the context of debates over the Commission's liberalisation plans. Commission officials said postal administrations had already begun work on making their costs, and thus the calculation of their fees, more transparent. Royal Mail said the EC had not criticised its general postage charges, but had merely taken a further step in examining a complaint filed five years ago about remailing.

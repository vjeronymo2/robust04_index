			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> O'NEILL PARK  </P> <P> Without fanfare, quietly, the County Board of Supervisors is considering a  proposal to turn O'Neill Regional Park into a Rancho Santa Margarita Country  Club.  </P> <P> The park is a quiet respite from ever increasing urbanization.  </P> <P> Now, in addition to being threatened by encroaching housing tracts, the  wilderness park is threatened by proposals to add tennis courts, swimming  pools, playing fields, paved motorcycle trails and an amphitheater.  </P> <P> This would destroy the rural character and wildlife habitats of O"Neill Park  and turn it into just another urban playground. Let's keep O"Neill Park  natural!  </P> <P> LAURI AUNAN  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

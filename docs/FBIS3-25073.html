The cabinet members and he discussed the devaluation of the CFA  franc. The cabinet members used the opportunity to express their  desire to embark upon a new policy of diversifying our economy  through the transformation of our raw materials locally. They  suggested that the government should abandon extravagant  projects and concentrate on agricultural and rural programs.  For more details, let us listen to Patrice Nziengui, minister  of communication, posts, and telecommunications in charge of  relations with the assemblies and spokesman of the government,  as he reads the communique issued at that meeting:    [Begin Nziengui recording] Under the distinguished  chairmanship of his Excellency El-Hajj Omar Bongo, president of  the Republic and head of state, a cabinet meeting was held today  at the usual meeting room of the Presidency of the Republic.  Before discussing the items on the agenda, the prime minister  and head of government briefed the cabinet on the National  Assembly plenary session held on 2 February which was devoted to  the devaluation of the CFA franc.    The prime minister's address to the National Assembly had  three goals: To inform the legislators about this very  important matter, namely the devaluation, to take stock of their  views on the issue, and to reaffirm the government's  determination to harmonize relations between the government and  the National Assembly. The prime minister expressed  satisfaction with the frank cooperation demonstrated by the  legislators. In view of the importance of the issue and its  disastrous effects on consumption and the purchasing power of  Gabonese nationals, the government stressed the need for a  policy oriented toward local production which should be  beneficial for our economy.    In this regard, the cabinet made it a point to reaffirm its  determination to embark upon a policy of diversifying our  economy through the transformation of our raw materials locally,  in particular in the fields of timber production and  agriculture. The government will also abandon extravagant  programs and rather increase rural agricultural projects.  Concerning compensatory measures suggested by France, the  government noted with satisfaction that [words indistinct] has  called on the government to work towards the total cancellation  of Gabon's bilateral debt. Also, the parliamentarians made  concrete proposals which are now being examined in the various  ministries.    Examining the problem of price increases, the cabinet  reaffirmed the need to ensure the respect of the measures  earlier adopted. As part of compensatory measures following the  devaluation of the CFA franc and upon the proposal of the  minister of finance, the cabinet adopted a draft bill  prohibiting any increase in the cost of transactions effected in  the CFA franc as a result of the devaluation. This decree  stipulates that prices fixed in agreements or contracts will  remain unchanged after devaluation. Consequently, any increase  in costs not provided for in transactions, and in particular for  reasons connected to the change in the parity of the local  currency, is forbidden. This decree became necessary in order  to prevent speculation by owners of property and buildings who,  in their desire to take advantage of the change in parity of the  CFA franc, may be tempted to revise sales contracts that have  been legally agreed upon.

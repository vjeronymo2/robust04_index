			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Nicaragua reforms constitution The Nicaraguan congress has approved constitutional reforms which ban close relatives of President Violeta Chamorro (left) from standing for the presidency, in a move to shift powers from the executive to parliament. The reforms, which allow for a second but not consecutive presidential term, are a defeat for Ms Chamorro's son-in-law, Mr Antonio Lacayo, the minister of the presidency and de facto prime minister. He was hoping to stand for president in May 1996. The vote means the hardline Sandinista leader and former president Mr Daniel Ortega may stand in 1996. But his plan to negotiate with Mr Lacayo the removal of the consanguinity ban - in exchange for a law to legalise Sandinista ownership of some properties confiscated during the party's 1979-90 administration - has been scuppered. It was supported by 32 moderate Sandinista congressmen out of a total of 39, in defiance of Mr Ortega and the Sandinista assembly. 'This is an enormous political defeat for Daniel Ortega and Antonio Lacayo,' says Mr Carlos Tunnerman, a former Sandinista ambassador to Washington, who has left the party. 'The division in the party is irreconcilable and a split is inevitable.' The vote cuts the presidential term from six to five years, obliges the government to seek congressional approval for international loans and trade negotiations, and makes the army more accountable to civil authority.</p>

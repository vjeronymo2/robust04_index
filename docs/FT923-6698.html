			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / Letter: A misplaced furore over the methods of creative accounting Sir, The furore over Terry Smith's book is greatly overdone. His is not the first on its subject: there was, for example, Ian Griffiths' Creative Accounting in 1986. Much of the material can be found in monthly management journals. The accounting practices are not necessarily devious either. Why should interest not be included, with the other costs of building an asset, in its value on the balance sheet? If a factory, of little value to anyone else and really only a passport to future earnings, appears on the balance sheet, why can't a brand, which combines both virtues? And why draw attention to a contingent liability like a claim for negligence or under warranty, when to do so would lend credence to an otherwise fragile lawsuit? There is, in any case, much unresolved confusion, even among specialists, about balance sheets. Some regard them as accurate summations of all past transactions; others, preferring relevance, as statements of current value. The problem exists because we have a stock market which expects something (smoothly increasing profits), and corporate legislation which prevents it. Reports are required at arbitrary intervals (12 months) bearing little relation to a company's natural trading cycle. We should not, therefore, blame companies which use creative accounting to transform an 'annual' series of fluctuating results (such as Dollars 4m profit, Pounds 1m loss, Pounds 15m profit, Pounds 3m loss) into a reported series of smoothly increasing profits (Pounds 1m, Pounds 2m, Pounds 4m, Pounds 8m). The latter can reflect the true underlying value of a company. Given this scope for legitimate manipulation (although new rules will soon reduce it), what does matter is the use, without sufficient thought, of growth in earnings-per-share for director bonuses. Having advised many boards on performance and remuneration, I urge caution here. Research I did in 1987 showed that earnings per share growth does not correlate strongly with share performance.

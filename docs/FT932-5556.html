			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Technology: Taking the soft option - Protecting the UK coastline Britain's coastline is under threat. Not only do many of the country's sea defences date from before 1939, but sea levels are rising through geological changes and global warming. To find better ways of protecting Britain's coastline from both erosion and flooding, the national Coastal Research Facility has been set up. This large tank - built to model the interactions of sea and shore - is the main element of a five-year, Pounds 5m coastal engineering programme funded by the Science and Engineering Research Council. The tank, a joint venture with the contract group HR Wallingford in Oxfordshire, will be able to model 800m stretches of coastline. Paul Meakin, secretary of Serc's environmental civil engineering committee, says one of the main results will be improved software for civil engineers who design and build defences. Britain has more than 17,000 miles of coastline, subject to the constant attrition of the sea. It is difficult to get a true picture of the scale of the threat because the last survey of flood and coastal defences was completed in 1981, although the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food expects to finish its national survey of coastal defences by September. With sea levels forecast to rise from 4mm a year on the Northumbrian coast to 6mm in the south and east, there is no doubt that the UK needs to improve its sea defences. But there is no consensus among researchers, engineers and funding bodies about how to do so. It is already well recognised that 'hard' defences will not solve Britain's serious coastal erosion problem. 'In fact, sea walls do nothing to stop erosion - they protect the land behind them but overall they reflect energy and cause the sea to take more material away,' says Dick Thomas, consulting engineer at Posford Duvivier, maritime engineering consultants. He says rough, sloping sea walls are now acknowledged as the best way of absorbing rather than reflecting the sea's energy, and walls of this type have been built at Mablethorpe and Skegness in Lincolnshire. Serc is also investigating alternative 'soft' defences. 'The aim is to find ways of placing sand and shingle beaches and make sure they stay there,' says Michael Owen, chairman of the Coastal Defence Research Committee, a unit of Serc's environmental committee. Beaches are often preferred to sea walls because they can absorb all the wave energy. But they do take up more room. A typical sea wall 5m high may need a strip 10m wide. A shingle beach 5m in height would typically have a slope of 1:8, and a sand beach a slope of 1:20. The difficulty of designing beaches is to predict what slope is needed for different waves and tidal situations. Beaches are also subject to drift and so need frequent maintenance. Despite this, they are cheaper than walls, which typically cost around Pounds 5,000 per metre. For example, Owen estimates that in the long run the shingle beach constructed at Seaford, near Newhaven, will cost 75 per cent of building a sea wall. But in common with sea walls, beaches can have knock-on effects. It is recognised that raising the height of the sand beach at Bournemouth to cut down erosion has resulted in neighbouring beaches being deprived of their natural source of recharge. Another problem with building soft defences is finding the right materials. Shingle is best because it absorbs most wave energy, but good shingle is difficult to find, Owen points out. The Construction Industry Research and Information Association is about to start a Pounds 500,000 project on coastline protection and beach management which will investigate this problem. 'The aim is to survey resources that for one reason or another are not currently exploited,' says Judy Payne, research manager in water engineering at Ciria. Another approach, which according to Chris Birks, head of flood defence at the National Rivers Authority is 'relatively novel in the UK', is the construction of artificial reefs to protect the coast by reducing wave energy. The NRA is constructing reefs 250m off the north Norfolk coast consisting of layers of rock held in place with mesh. The trend in coastal defences is towards soft engineering, Birks says. 'This means working with the coastal processes and using nature against nature.' The most fashionable example is strategic retreat. This means allowing the sea to inundate existing sea walls and create a salt marsh, building a new sea wall on higher ground. The approach is favoured by the conservation body English Nature because it will create important wildlife habitats and by the ministry because it is much cheaper than building higher and higher sea walls. No one advocates strategic retreat in areas where there is any risk to property, but there is a feeling that it is pointless to protect marginal farmland when farmers are being paid to take land out of production. An experiment is taking place at Northey Island in Essex where the tide has been allowed to flood over the old sea wall to begin creating a salt marsh and a lower sea wall has been built on higher ground. A 10m stretch of salt marsh offers the same protection as 1m on top of a sea wall. But Alan Gray, head of population ecology and genetics at the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, says it is not just a matter of allowing land to be flooded by seawater. 'Salt marshes need to be designed just as much as sea walls and beaches are. It is essential to carry out tidal studies because there is a chance of altering the balance between the ebb and flow of the tide so that sediments are sucked out rather than being deposited.' The life expectancy of a sea wall is 50 years - the same time it takes for a mudflat to develop into a saltmarsh. So a managed retreat scheme would have much longer life than a hard defence. However, Dick Thomas is sceptical about building soft defences to replace sea walls. 'Even if the sea wall has been undermined, with a bit of work it will be as good as new. If you go to a softer defence you are sometimes rejecting all existing assets.'</p>

			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Klockner seeks cover from storm in the market: Why the German steel maker has had to file for protection Klockner-Werke, Germany's little fish in the shark pool of the world steel market, grew legs three years ago and made a dash for dry land. But it was not fast enough. Loaded down with debts of DM2.7bn, (Pounds 1.08bn) enfeebled by tumbling steel prices, and latterly tripped up by the sudden slump in the German motor industry, it stumbled into the protective custody of the courts last Friday. Desperate to catch its breath, Klockner applied for protection from its creditors and permission to start negotiating to write off 60 per cent of the debts accumulated by its two steel divisions and the parent, Klockner AG. Warrants for the proposed 40 per cent settlement are to be issued by the Klockner Mercator Maschinenbau (KMM) subsidiary, in which the still-profitable motor components, plastics and engineering businesses are bundled together. According to chief executive Mr Hans Christoph von Rohr, this 'technical financial operation' will set the group back on the road to survival. Since Deutsche Bank, the group's biggest creditor and Germany's biggest bank, has already promised its full support for the rescue, it may be safely assumed that the composition proceedings will be successfully completed within the scheduled maximum of six months. Then, according to conventional wisdom, the worst of the current international economic crisis should be over. The extent to which Klockner will share in the upturn, and the form in which the stricken concern survives, remain to be seen. But the group will be coming from a long way back. It emerged limping from the last cyclical downturn in steel, under-capitalised and over-focused on low value-added products such as building steel. It has paid only one dividend in the past 18 years. Although Mr von Rohr appeared unruffled last week, the group is technically insolvent  -a whisker away from bankruptcy - and in the undignified position of being only the first significant German group to run for cover in composition proceedings in the past decade. Klockner started to come to grips with its weaknesses in the late 1980s. In 1989, when steel and steel processing still accounted for 90 per cent of sales and 100 per cent of profits, it began a process of accelerated evolution. In a bid to add value to its core business, it took on Finnish and Japanese partners to build a DM400m hot galvanising mill in Bremen. Designed to supply Japanese car plants in Europe, it is due to start work next year. But a key shift was diversification into motor components, a path already established by larger competitors such as Mannesmann, Hoesch and Krupp. In 1989 it bought Kautex, a plastics company making vehicle petrol tanks. A year later it paid DM400m for Eurotec, a mouldings concern dependent on motor makers for 85 per cent of sales. Plastics are now the group's single biggest source of turnover. Meanwhile, other businesses - drinks machines and bottling plant manufacture - were added for good measure. But Klockner's new legs have proved neither long enough nor strong enough to carry the group out of the trough. Plastics and mechanical engineering made operating profits of just DM65m last year, as losses in steel climbed from DM35m to DM200m. Meanwhile, prospects are dimming for key parts of KMM dependent on the automotive industry. German motor vehicle production is falling fast. Leading manufacturers including Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen, which earlier this year unveiled plans for huge medium-term job cuts, have lately announced extensive short-time working in the first quarter of the new year. According to some estimates, German car output will fall by 500,000 in 1993. The knock-on effects on suppliers were highlighted over the weekend when ZF, the gearbox and transmissions specialist, said orders in the past few months had been between 15 and 20 per cent down on last year. The company, which reported an operating loss in 1991 and expects further deficits this year and next, said it was to cut its workforce by 1,200. Car body press maker Schuler unveiled plans to reduce its payroll by a quarter. Crisis in the international steel market has been apparent for far longer. A slight improvement in prices noted in Germany in the first quarter of this year evaporated with the arrival of spring. According to Mr von Rohr, prices are now DM150 a tonne lower than two years ago. While pundits argue over whether conditions arise from structural or cyclical sources, losses and tensions are mounting. Eurofer, the European Community steel makers' association, has asked the commission for Ecu4bn (Pounds 3.2bn) in assistance for a restructuring plan which will cost 50,000 jobs. According to some estimates there is a surplus annual capacity of 40m tonnes in the EC. At the same time, the US authorities are preparing to impose countervailing duties and anti-dumping charges on a range of EC products. In such conditions, shutting down Klockner's 3m-plus raw steel capacity seems the logical and inevitable outcome. A takeover by either of the leaders in German steel - which also have substantial motor component interests - would almost certainly run into opposition from the Berlin cartel authorities. In any case, Thyssen and the recently-merged Krupp/Hoesch group which each have around 10m tonnes a year capacity, have problems of their own. Western German steel production fell by 20 per cent in November, due in part to Thyssen's temporary closure of a quarter of its capacity. One lingering sign of hope lies in the continuation of collaboration negotiations between Klockner and Hoogovens of the Netherlands, which were expected to be completed by the end of January. The process may take longer now that the weaknesses of the would-be partner from Germany have been so brutally exposed. If a bargain is struck it is more than likely to be on Hoogovens' terms: as Mr von Rohr has discovered, there is more mercy in the courts than the marketplace.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EC CRUDE STEEL PRODUCTION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991 (m tonnes)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Germany                     42.17 Italy                       25.24 France                      18.44 UK                          16.52 Spain                       12.80 Belguim                     11.35 Netherlands                  5.17 Luxembourg                   3.38 Greece                       0.98 Denmark                      0.63 Portugal                     0.57 Ireland                      0.29  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Eurostat  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BIGGEST PRODUCERS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 1991 output                                    m tonnes  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Usinor Sacilor             France                 22.80 British Steel              UK                     12.94 Ilva                       Italy                  11.00 Thyssen                    Germany                10.90 Arbed                      Luxembourg              7.63 Hoogovens                  Netherlands             4.94 Cockerill Sambre           Belguim                 4.40 Hoesch                     Germany                 4.20 Peine Salzgitter           Germany                 4.14 HKM*                       Germany                 3.93 Ensidesa                   Spain                   3.92 Klockner                   Germany                 3.35  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Meps Europe/Metal Bulletin       * Huttenwerke krupp Mannesmann  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

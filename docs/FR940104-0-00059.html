			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> One commenter stated that children are unlikely to consume sediment at the same rate that they consume soil. The Agency agrees, but notes that sediment consumption by children was not considered as an exposure pathway in the proposed rule. The Agency does not feel that this exposure pathway is a significant one in making a determination whether or not to list chlorophenolic wastes since the exposure areas of concern are relatively small and any land conversion which could take place would most likely require soil testing prior to land development.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that the assumptions used to estimate the exposed population in the soil ingestion population risk scenario greatly overestimate the number of exposed children. EPA believes that the scenario may be conservative, but not implausible. The scenario assumes that all sawmill sites are converted to rural residential land use, that the children's play areas are located on the site of the former storage yards, and that the homes are resold to new families with young children every 25 years. These assumptions include a low population density in these areas. It would take only a limited number of sites to be converted to suburban housing or to daycare or school facilities to cause a substantial increase in the exposed population. The incremental population risk estimated using the corrected incremental value for the storage yard soil TCDD-TEQ concentration is 4E&hyph;7 cases in 70 years, three orders of magnitude lower than that in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter maintained that the soil ingestion scenario was questionable because Superfund liabilities, state laws, and lender requirements make land use changes unlikely without site cleanup activities. The EPA agrees that, in some states, land transfers and subsequent land use changes would be unlikely to occur without cleanup. However, not all states are equally diligent in requiring site investigations at the time of property transfer, making the types of land use changes described in the soil ingestion scenario plausible. Because of this, EPA believes it is entirely appropriate to assess risk via the soil ingestion pathway, notwithstanding any risk management decisions that may be made at some future time to address the risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters believed that some of the values used as input parameters to the ground-water model ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  recharge rate, regional conductivity, and average depth to water) were too conservative and that more appropriate input parameters should be used in this MULTIMED model. One commenter believed that the Agency had used DRASTIC (a name given to a modelling program used to evaluate the potential which may exist resulting from groundwater pollution) to perform its groundwater modeling. First, the EPA did not use the DRASTIC model in this rulemaking effort; it used the MULTIMED model developed by the Agency to perform groundwater models. The Agency did, however, use some soil and hydrogeologic information (on hydrogeologic regions and subregions collected by Aller  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1988)) which is used when applying the DRASTIC model. With regard to the parameters felt by the commenter to be too conservative, the EPA supports the values used in the proposed rule (58 FR at 25706 of April 27, 1993). This hydrogeologic information includes many of the input parameters required to run the MULTIMED model, and includes such parameters as depth to water, soil type and hydraulic conductivity, net recharge, aquifer hydraulic conductivity. The EPA selected hydrogeologic subregions in the northwest and southeast United States, excluding subregions where sawmills were not likely to be sited ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  mountain slopes or flanks). Since the parameter value ranges presented in Aller  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1988) are based on compilations of literature values and expert opinion, the values should be viewed as bounding ranges, and are not sufficiently statistically rigorous to estimate true means or parameter distributions. For the average case, ``typical'' parameter values were obtained by examining the ranges of values in Aller  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1988) for the selected subregions only and selecting values representing the central tendency of the reported ranges. Similarly, high-end values were selected to represent the high end of the exposure distribution, using the higher end of the range of parameter values deemed likely to occur by Aller  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (1988). EPA recognizes that there are limitations to this approach, largely associated with the non-statistical nature of the data. The Agency believes, however, that this data source is the best available at this time for regional and subregional estimates of the hydrogeologic properties necessary to estimate exposures through the ground-water pathway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters felt that the Agency's use of input parameter values used for well location and well intake point were too conservative. EPA derived the horizontal distance to wells from the responses reported in the RCRA's 3007 Industry Questionnaires. Because information was not obtained on the well type or construction, all wells described in the questionnaire were assumed to be possible sources of drinking water and were assumed to be screened to the top of the aquifer, that is, well water was assumed to be drawn off the top of the aquifer where organics are assumed to exist in greater concentrations than when water is drawn from the middle of the aquifer. These assumptions are consistent with similar conservative assumptions used to develop other RCRA regulations, such as the Toxicity Characteristic (55 FR 11798, March 29, 1990).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Two commenters contended that neither biodegradation or chemical degradation rates were considered in the ground-water modeling of pentachlorophenol contamination. These commenters submitted studies showing that biological and chemical degradation of PCP can occur and that adequate biological and chemical degradation rates are available or can be estimated from these studies. EPA has reviewed these studies and agrees that they do indicate that biological and chemical degradation of PCP can occur. The information submitted by the commenters are results from laboratory studies, reporting the results from controlled experiments. However, EPA does not agree that there is sufficient information on unassisted field degradation rates, the geochemical factors that affect degradation, or their spatial variability from site-to-site or region-to-region to model degradation in the field at generic or prototypical sites for regulatory purposes. Moreover, the existence of metabolites that would confirm the occurrence of biodegradation in the field has not been firmly established. Therefore, EPA does not believe the data warrant an assumption that biodegradation does occur at significant rates at most sites. In addition, the toxicities of potential degradation products have not been characterized. Therefore, the EPA does not believe it is appropriate to consider these mechanisms in this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

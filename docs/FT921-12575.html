			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / How To Spend It: Stresses and your tresses - Lucia van der Post gets to the root of hair repair, finds out what it costs to breathe clean air and visits a furniture showroom THERE are not too many growth industries around at the moment but stressed hair seems to be one. JF Lazartigue, the Frenchman who is to hair what Jane Fonda is to aerobics, has seen his sales worldwide go up by 20 per cent every year for the last 15 years. Al though in France growth last year fell to 5 per cent from the 15 to 30 per cent he had become used to it is still growth. When times are tough women, it seems, still find time and money to invest in their hair. You probably feel you have more than enough to worry about and are stressed enough already without fresh troubles but, if JF Lazartigue is right - and he is in a good position to know - then you had better start worrying now. 'More and more women are coming into my centres with thinning hair,' he says. Women, it seems, do such terrible things to their hair. They perm it and tease it, colour it and twist it. They wash it with shampoos that are too strong and dry it at high temperatures. The world around them does not help either - the air is polluted and then they lead such stressful lives. 'All this,' Lazartigue is convinced, 'shows up in the hair.' He used to be just a simple hairdresser but soon began to specialise in 'defrisage' (hair-straightening). Most of the women who wanted their hair straightened had badly abused hair. 'And,' as he puts it so succinctly, 'you cannot make a nice hairstyle with poor hair and many of my customers had very poor hair.' He started to make products to deal with the hair conditions that kept turning up in his salon. 'Everywhere else there were average products for average hair. Nowhere could I find specialist products to deal with special problems.' The first he made out of beef-marrow, a traditional remedy de grand-mere, which he collected from butchers' shops all over Paris on Saturdays and boiled up at home in stock-pots on Sundays. As his product range grew he found the women who came to his salon wanted to buy the products to take home - in other words, they seemed to feel they worked. He had never wanted to sell just potions - he wanted to find a way of making sure he sold the product that matched the problem. So the concept of the diagnostic and advisory service developed. Women would have their hair examined - a few hairs would be plucked out and studied under the microscope by a qualified analyst. Only then would the right products be prescribed. The first centre opened on the Champs Elysees in 1975 and from the first day women went there with their hair problems. Today there are 140 centres in some 40 different countries. Having your hair analysed can be, I warn you, a depressing experience. When I dropped into the first ever JF Lazartigue Diagnostic and Advisory hair centre some three years ago, the news was all bad. Only one of the some 20 hairs that the delightful Odile put under the microscope could be said to be anywhere near normal. All the others were pronounced no good because the hair was damaged. Baldness stared me in the face. I crept away with a fistful of potions in a plastic bag. Odile did not see me back. If there was any more bad news in the pipeline I did not want to know. Three years on and, against all the odds still with a full head of hair, I went along to talk, but only to talk, to Jean-Francois Lazartigue as he opened yet another of his hair and treatment centres, this time at 204 Sloane Street, London SW1. Nothing was going to get any of my hairs near the microviewer. There was the lovely Odile again, hair as lustrously shining as ever and, wouldn't you know, I hardly had my coat off before my hairs were magnified 80 times on the screen. Odile and I were quite astonished - 'Look,' she says, pointing to the magnified root on the screen, 'a beautiful pear-shaped bulb. The shaft is very healthy, too. Everything is brilliant, you just have a little build-up of oiliness in the roots.' Ah, the relief. I can put off the visit to the wig shop. The roots are, of course, where all the trouble begins. Detergent-based shampoos and stress combine to make the hair bulb produce squalene, an acidic ingredient in sebum, which can damage the hair. 'We must catch that now,' said Odile and wrote me a chart of what to do. I was prescribed a gentle, non-detergent based shampoo, something to help rebalance the oiliness in the roots, and a conditioner to give everyday body to the hair. Once a week, she suggested, I should set aside 20 minutes and give my hair deep conditioning and restore more life to my highlights. Does it work? It is hard to say. The products feel and smell good. I like the idea that I am using non detergent-based shampoos, that the products have an air of quality to them. If they do cost more than the usual chemists' range (the cheapest shampoo is Pounds 12, the most expensive Pounds 19, the colour reflecting conditioners Pounds 16 and the most expensive product, for urgent rehabilitation is Pounds 28) then I am prepared to pay the difference. Hair products in most stores and chemist shops are very broadly targeted. Everything in the Lazartigue range, on the other hand, has been developed for very specific hair conditions. The acid test seems to me that customers come back. There are three diagnostic and advisory centres in this country: 20 James Street, London W1M 5 HN, 204; Sloane Street, London SW1 9XQ; and the JF Lazartigue counter at Harrods, Knightsbridge, London SW1. For those who cannot get to the centres the products are sold in good chemists and by mail order (a questionnaire accompanies the form) from 20, James Street.</p>

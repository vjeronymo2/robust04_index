			<p><P> October 1, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PACIFIC 10 ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> THIS TIME, STANFORD FAILS TO COME BACK  </P> <P> Everett Lampkins intercepted a pass by Steve Smith and returned it 39 yards for  a touchdown in the fourth quarter as San Jose State defeated Stanford, 40-33,  Saturday at Stanford.  </P> <P> With 5:21 remaining, Stanford's John Hopkins, who kicked four field goals, made  a 46-yarder to pull the Cardinal within six points, but San Jose held on for  the victory.  </P> <P> A 22-yard touchdown pass from Matt Veatch to Doug Hooker was ruled caught after  pass interference by Stanford's Kevin Scott, putting San Jose in front, 34-30.  </P> <P> The decision came after much discussion and no initial touchdown signal.  </P> <P> "As far as the interference, I can't argue that because it's the official's  call," Scott said. "But when they gave him the touchdown. He didn't catch the  ball, it hit the ground. And I was in front of him, so I don't see how I could  have interfered with him."  </P> <P> San Jose State is 2-1. Stanford, which plays host to Notre Dame next Saturday,  fell to 1-3.  </P> <P> Stanford, after trailing 17-0, beat Oregon, 18-17, last week on a 37-yard field  goal with no time left.  </P> <P> But Stanford came up short against San Jose.  </P> <P> Stanford turnovers led to the first two San Jose touchdowns, both eight-yard  scoring runs by Sheldon Canley.  </P> <P> The first Stanford touchdown came after Tony Trousset intercepted a bomb by  Veatch at the Stanford 13. The Cardinal moved the ball 87 yards in 10 plays and  scored on a 23-yard pass from Smith to a diving Jon Pinckney.  </P> <P> Smith connected for another touchdown in the first half, hitting Ed McCaffrey  in the right side of the end zone from 17 yards out to put the Cardinal ahead,  17-14.  </P> <P> The Spartans took a 21-17 lead on Veatch's 13-yard touchdown pass to Kevin  Evans.  </P> <P> Hopkins' 54-yard field goal, a career best, with two seconds remaining in the  half cut the score to 21-20.  </P> <P> McCaffery caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Smith in the third quarter to  give the Cardinal a 27-21 advantage. A 39-yard scoring run by Veatch put San  Jose State back on top, 28-27.  </P> <P> Hopkins, who kicked a 36-yard field goal three seconds into the second quarter  for Stanford's first points of the game, made another 36-yard kick in the third  quarter to give the Cardinal a 30-28 lead.  </P> <P> Arizona St. 19, Missouri 3 -- Jeff Simoneau scored two fourth-quarter  touchdowns and David Winsley rushed for a career-high 134 yards as the Sun  Devils beat the Tigers in a nonconference game at Tempe.  </P> <P> It was the first win for the Sun Devils (3-1) over Missouri (1-3) since the  1972 Fiesta Bowl. The Tigers had won the last two meetings by shutouts -- 9-0  in 1974 at Columbia, Mo., and 15-0 at Tempe in 1977.  </P> <P> Alan Zendejas kicked a 36-yard field goal with 12:14 left in the third quarter  to put Arizona State ahead to stay at 5-3.  </P> <P> Simoneau scored on a four-yard run with 12:57 remaining and a one-yard plunge  with 3:41 to play.  </P></p>

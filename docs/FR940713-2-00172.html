International research and development activities significantly can change the perspectives of service providers and researchers, provide data for the evaluation of domestic programs, and offer new insights and new practices that can solve some of the old rehabilitation problems. Learning about the technical and cultural aspects of other countries' rehabilitation practices may assist U.S. rehabilitation practioners to improve the effectiveness of the services they provide, especially for minority and immigrant populations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the past, NIDRR approached international activities in two ways. NIDRR funded two projects to facilitate fellowships of non-governmental experts to other countries to gather data on practices, legislation, and policy. NIDRR also engaged in international activities on a government-to-government basis, participating in international policy and data generation through international organizations such as the U.N., Federal agencies such as the Department of State and the Peace Corps, direct grants to foreign research agencies, participation in foreign research consortia and conferences, and facilitation of site visits and study tours for foreign visitors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to enhance the impact of international activities on the U.S. rehabilitation field, NIDRR now seeks to fund a single project that will facilitate the exchange of both domestic and foreign experts in rehabilitation research and technical assistance; facilitate international conferences; disseminate useful information to rehabilitation personnel and researchers, independent living centers, and families; assist in relevant site visitations by foreign government officials; and develop training modules that increase participation in international activities by rehabilitation practitioners, policymakers, and individuals with disabilities. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Priority <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A project on the international exchange of information and experts shall_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Gather information on international rehabilitation issues, legislation, and programs, and maintain a database of such information that is available to relevant research projects and training projects, including those supported by NIDRR, the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), and the Rehabilitation Services Administration (RSA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Include individuals with disabilities to the maximum extent possible in all project activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Facilitate small annual conferences to explore international issues or to share rehabilitation information and data with other governments; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Assist foreign and domestic professionals or consumers to plan trips by identifying potential sites and contact persons at each site; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Establish an international exchange of research and technical assistance experts between foreign nations and the U.S.; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Share information with other Federal government agencies in order to assist them in the development of their research priorities in the area of disability; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Publish and disseminate data and information to relevant target audiences on relevant policy issues and legislation, which are identified in conjunction with NIDRR; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop training activities and materials to sensitize rehabilitation personnel, including special education personnel, to cultural differences that can affect rehabilitation needs and approaches; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Develop training activities and materials on comparative research techniques, bilateral consultation and technical assistance, utilizing the different international and cultural perspectives. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> APPLICABLE PROGRAM REGULATIONS:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> 34 CFR Parts 350 and 355.

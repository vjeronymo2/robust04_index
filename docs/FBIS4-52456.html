			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Fresh Cambodian Elections Will Never Defeat the </F> KR"]    [Text] King Norodom Sihanouk's call last week for fresh  general elections appears to be more an expression of his utter  desperation about the situation in his war-blighted country than  a viable plan for peace.    Speaking to a group of monks on Thursday the monarch said  that the rebel Khmer Rouge, who refused to recognize the results  of UN sponsored polls last year, should be willing to test their  popularity in a democratic poll if they are truly  representatives of the people.    The current leaders "are all sportsmen, so they must agree  ... Then we can compete with each other through peaceful means.  There will be no killing of each other, but we can attack each  other through microphones," the king said.    But in Cambodia elections are a blood sport. The country has  no history of peaceful transfer of power and no tradition of  parliamentary opposition. Like the Khmer Rouge now, the losers  in any battle for power have traditionally taken their struggle  to the jungle and there is nothing to suggest anything would  change if polls were held.    Even with 23,000 UN soldiers and officials monitoring last  year's polls, the election campaign proceeded under a climate of  fear. Scores of candidates and canvassers were gunned down,  voters intimidated, and ethnic Vietnamese massacred to make a  political point. And then when the ballots were tallied, the  Cambodian People's Party (CPP) threatened to take a large  portion of the country and secede when it became apparent the  royalist Funcinpec [National United Front for an Independent,  Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] party would win.    The CPP and Funcinpec have since ruled in an uneasy  coalition  but much suspicion and acrimony remains. With much of Cambodia  currently under threat from the Khmer Rouge insurgency, the  timing couldn't be worse for the holding of a new election.    Much of the blame for the current mess in Cambodia must rest  with the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia  (Untac) for failing to disarm the four warring factions as was  required by the 1991 Paris Peace Accord.    Untac military chief Lt Gen John Sanderson argued that to  have used force to disarm the Khmer Rouge would have breached  the mission's peacekeeping mandate. What's more, he said, it  would have been martial folly in the jungles of Cambodia.    But now with the Khmer Rouge threatening to impose a reign  of  terror over much of the northwest, the entire  three-billion-dollar peace mission is beginning to look like  folly.    By allowing the Khmer Rouge to remain armed, dangerous and  outside the peace process, left behind a dangerous legacy for  the new government. It also meant Untac was never able carry  out another crucial provision of the peace accord -- the  establishment of a new national army.    The United Nations cannot be blamed for the Royal Cambodian  Army's recent crushing defeats at the hands of the guerrillas at  Anlung Veng and Pailin. But the prospects for Cambodia's  post-election future would have been much brighter if even a  modestly trained and functioning army had been up and running  when Untac pulled out.    As things now stand, it appears that if Phnom Penh is ever  to  overcome the Khmer Rouge threat, constant military pressure is  going to have to be applied.    The guerrillas have shown no sign of sincere interest in  King  Sihanouk's earlier peace initiative which would have given  acceptable members of the group positions in power in exchange  for an end to their insurgency. Instead, the group's leaders  continue to respond to government overtures with their  anachronistic rantings about "the Vietnamese puppets, their  lackies and the entente."    The Khmer Rouge have demonstrated over and over again they  have no interest in participating in the rebuilding of Cambodia  along democratic principals. Should they accept an invitation  to join the elections there is no reason to believe they would  campaign peacefully or abide by the results.    In last year's election, the real heroes were not the UN  organizers but the voters who in great numbers defied threats of  violence and death to cast ballots for their chosen party. But  asking the Cambodians to take such a risk again under the  current conditions would be to ask too much.    The UN tried valiantly to introduce democratic concepts to  Cambodia as it steered the country towards elections.    But in Cambodia, it is the law of power that has always  ruled  and the only precept the Khmer Rouge responds to. Unfortunately  for the new government in Phnom Penh, its army seems ineptly-led  and ridden with corruption.    The international community would be right to respond to  Cambodia's appeals for assistance to help train its military.    Elections, even those cleanly held, won't defeat the Khmer  Rouge. Only force coupled with programs to better the lot of the  population will finally rid Cambodia of this curse.</p>

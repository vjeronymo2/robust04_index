Lukas, who heads the Tartu section of the senior party in  the  country's ruling coalition, said there were no reasons of  ideological character behind the changes in the Cabinet.    He said the planned replacement of Toomas Sildmae, the  minister of the economy, was necessary because of shortcomings  in the ministry's work on drawing up legislation. He said it had  been the ruling coalition's Pro Patria and National Independence  Party parliament factions that were most dissatisfied with the  ministry's work under Sildmae. Lukas added that the ruling  parties had been at one with Sildmae over the economic policy.    Sildmae, who entered the political government from the  country's young business elite, is receiving continuous support  from the industrial and business circles, who say Sildmae's  replacement as minister would negatively affect the economy.    Commenting on possible problems related to Sildmae's  quitting  the office, Lukas said he was still not quite sure that all the  four ministers would be replaced.    Lukas said the appointment of Defense Minister Juri Luik to  take over as the foreign minister was called by the need to gain  better control over different departments in the Foreign  Ministry and make the ministry work more effectively.    "As far as I know it was the wish of (Prime Minister) Laar,  Luik, as well as President Meri that Luik be removed from the  office of the defense minister," Lukas added.    He said that the issue of replacing Finance Minister Madis  Uurike had "stood long on the agenda."    "When all ministers cope with their work and the government  works well together, the government's popularity will rise," he  said.    "I consider the government repair a practical step without  any ideological background," Lukas mentioned. "It is high time  for the people to get used to such steps," he added.</p>

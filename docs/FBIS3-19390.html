			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sarah Womack and Chris Moncrieff, PRESS ASSOCIATION </F> political staff]    [Excerpt] Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd was tonight  walking a tightrope over enlarging the European Union [EU] that  could spark more internal warfare in the Tory Party. He faced  the tricky dilemma of maintaining Britain's voting powers to  block EU legislation while not threatening the enlargement  process, which Britain backs.    He was applauded by Tory backbenchers at a private meeting  in  the Commons tonight after returning from Brussels, where he and  fellow foreign ministers reached deadlock after 10 hours of  bitter talks.    Britain is refusing to budge from the present position where  23 votes (from the 76 available among the 12 member states) can  block Brussels legislation. All the other countries -- except  Spain -- say that with the addition of Finland, Austria, Norway  and Sweden, that figure should increase to 27 from the 90 votes  then available.    Negotiations will resume in Brussels on Tuesday [22 March]  --  with the prospect of one of the biggest Euro-rows blowing up for  years.    But Mr Hurd warned Tory MPs that delay could threaten  Community enlargement, which Britain champions.    Equally any weakening of Britain's position could create  fresh Tory strife which could have a calamitous effect on the  party's showing at the June Euro-elections.    Mr Hurd bluntly told the MPs that enlargement was something  they had worked for for many years and for very good national  reasons. "This is the kind of Europe we want," he said. "It  clearly would not be sensible to scrap that policy just when it  had succeeded. We are not prepared to accept an automatic  mechanical upgrading of the qualifying majority from 23 to 27."    But he warned them that to delay enlargement indefinitely  could risk the collapse of the enterprise.    Mr Hurd told his colleagues, at the meeting which lasted  more  than an hour, that he did not want to get into details of the  ideas coming forward. But he declared: "I have not shifted at  all."    Even so, MPs expect the days between now and Tuesday to be  occupied with attempts at compromise -- without, in the words of  one Tory Euro-dissident, "selling Britain down the river."    There were, Mr Hurd told MPs, people "trying to breach the  gap."    Meanwhile, Tory Euro-rebels -- who caused such havoc during  the Parliamentary passage of the Maastricht legislation -- are  tonight standing four-square behind Mr Hurd. But the growing  fear among Tory business managers is that if Britain is forced  to compromise and weaken her position, the Euro-storm will flare  up uncontrollably again.    Mr Hurd, however, has told colleagues since the meeting that  when he said that support was what he needed, it was forthcoming  "beyond the ordinary." His clear message was: "We will just go  on until we get there."    But he remained tight-lipped about his tactics, saying that  he was in the middle of difficult and delicate negotiations.  Plainly he did not wish to expose his hand to his opponents  ahead of the next Brussels encounter. [passage omitted]</p>

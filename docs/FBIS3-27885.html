			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Text] Ordinary Koreans are perplexed not only by Finance </F> Minister Hong Chae-hyong's speedy implementation of financial  reform but also by the continued U.S. complaints about the  domestic market opening.    Is Minister Hong lying or is the United States seeking an  "overblown" political and strategic reaction to squeeze more  concessions from Korea?    U.S. government officials, including U.S. Trade  Representative chief Mickey Kantor, picked Korea and Japan as  their "main problem countries" in their market opening regarding  for American financial service firms.    Finance Minister Hong said he wants to make Seoul a leading  financial center in Northeast Asia. And few Korean bankers  doubt the government has been implementing its financial reform  plan at a full speed.    Many American bankers, including James D. Vaughn, manager of  the Seoul branch of American Express Bank, did not hesitate in  praising Seoul's recent financial reforms but U.S. government  officials are reluctant to appreciate what's happening in the  Korean financial market.    A few divisions of the MOF [Ministry of Finance] appear to  be  waging a competition these days to rewrite insurance, foreign  exchange, and foreign direct investment laws. They are  liberalizing foreign exchange and capital flows and eliminating  preferential policy loans. They deregulated the bulk of  interest rates, and announced a series of reform measures.    Why does the United States have such a complaint? Is it  justifiable?    Many analysts here believe that the U.S. Treasury Department  and the U.S. Trade Representative are waging their own  competition to gain the upper hand in their push to open the  "lucrative" financial market in Korea. Sandwiched between the  bureaucratic infighting, Korea faces double pressure, they said.    Seoul's financial market is being liberalized at a rapid  pace  by Korean standards but at a snail's pace by U.S. norms, a  Western diplomat said.    Kantor said the United States wants Korea to open its market  in a way that the United States and the European Union open  theirs.    Choe Chang-pong, an economist at the Korea Tax Institute,  said "The United States will not be satisfied until Korea has an  open financial system the same as the United States has." But he  said if Korea further speeds up its liberalization, local  institutions may have a tough time in keeping up with it."  [quotation marks as published]    Washington is hell-bent on prying open Korea's financial  market because American financial services firms can do good  business here. The United States appears to expect Seoul to open  its financial market wider following Korea's concession to open  its rice market, analysts said.    Although Seoul unveiled its five-year financial reform plan  last year, it refused to link it to the Uruguay Round. This  raised U.S. suspicions that Korea might change its mind on  reform in the future, they said.    Washington believes that without constant pressure, Korea  might backpedal on its liberalization, analysts here said.    The U.S. threat to retaliate has discouraged Korean  policymakers who have worked overtime to implement financial  reform plans, an MOF official said.    One Seoul professor said, "If the U.S. repeats its threat of  retaliation without praising Seoul's achievements, MOF officials  may not voluntarily deregulate financial rules." Instead, they  will hide major issues of great interest to American firms until  the United States puts pressure on Korea.    They will hide "big gifts" (concessions) until U.S.  officials  visit Korea, he added.    He and Korean economists said that the U.S. will invite  undue  anti-Americanism from the Korean people when they use such  "hackneyed" words as threat or retaliation at a time when the  nation is moving toward fuller financial reform.  <H5>  U.S. Pressure </H5>   MOF officials are angered when U.S. officials threaten to  twist their arms to open the market further at a time when many  American bankers and businessmen are praising MOF officials for  their reform of the domestic financial system. They question  who is pushing the U.S. government to put pressure on Korea to  open its market wider. MOF officials suspect that a few  American bankers, who have seen their profits fall here, are  complaining that it is because of the "worsening business  environment."    The worsening environment is due to the intensifying  competition following deregulation, not because of Seoul's  discriminatory practices against foreign financiers, MOF  officials said.    Many bankers, including Hana Bank's Yun Pyong-chol, said the  more Korea opens its market, the more difficulty foreign banks  will face in expanding revenue.    MOF officials speculate such complaints originate from a few  foreign bankers' attempt to hide their mismanagement or lack of  talent.  <H5>  Arm-Twisting </H5>   The U.S. Treasury expects Congress to enact the "Fair Trade  in Financial Services Act." For the first time, the U.S.  administration has taken a unified position in supporting this  legislation, which will be used to retaliate against foreign  countries. But analysts here said there are still problems,  however, in winning passage, particularly in the House of  Representatives.    Despite high-pitched rhetoric, the United States will not be  able to retaliate against Korea at least until the end of 1995.  An MOF official said, "We are worried over how successfully we  implement our reform plan, not U.S. retaliatory threats."    For the next two years, Washington will seek intensify  pressure on Korea and other Asian countries to open their  financial markets. But MOF officials say over the next two  years, Korea will implement the bulk of its five-year financial  reform program and hope U.S. complaints die down.</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (5): Resistance in Europe - Total deregulation is still a long way off BRUSSELS is well aware that the development of Europe's telecommunications infrastructure is essential to obtain maximum benefit from the single market and to strengthening the EC's global competitive edge. It is estimated that more than half of EC jobs depend on information and communication technology. Telecommunications alone are set to account for around 6 per cent of the EC's GDP by the year 2000. The Commission estimates full liberalisation of the EC's telecom market would double its rate of growth, and increase by four the size of the market over the next 20 years. But despite several years of market reforms and a plethora of EC directives and recommendations which have succeeded in opening up the terminal equipment market and a substantial part of telecommunications infrastructure, the vast majority of EC telephone services is still under the control of state-owned monopolies. The Commission strategy to crack open the crucial voice telephony market, which account for 90 per cent telephone services is centring around just a small section of that market: cross-border phone calls. And like previous deregulatory moves, the Commission's aspirations look set to face resistance from EC member-states every step of the way. Paris' successful stab at persuading the Commission from even discussing the plans until after the French referendum on Maastricht clearly illustrated political sensitivities in the sector. The French government feared that an attack on France Telecom would have been the last straw for many undecided voters. The cornerstone of EC telecommunications policy is the much-read 1987 Green paper. The document emphasised opening up the terminal equipment - telephones, faxes, modems and the like - to free competition and the part-liberalisation of the telecommunications service business. In 1988, the Commission issued a directive to open up the EC's market for terminal equipment to competition. The aim was to allow consumers to benefit from new technology and design by giving them a free selection instead of the 'Hobson's choice' offered by many of Europe's telephone monopolies. In order to do so, the Commission took advantage its mandate under Article 90 of EC competition law: this allowed the commission to bypass the EC's Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to pass legislation to stop member-states maintaining measures contrary to the Treaty of Rome rules on the free market. But there was one institution which the commission still had to reckon with: the EC's constitutional watchdog, the European Court of justice. France, backed by a number of other EC countries, challenged the Commission's right to the use of Article 90. Their main concern was that they would be left out of future discussions on the abolition of their national telephone monopolies. Three years later, the court ruled the commission was acting legitimately in relation to state measures affecting telecommunications undertakings where these measures were at odds with the treaty. But a looming court decision slowed down liberalisation as private sector investors were hesitant to take up the new opportunities until the political situation was more certain. The Commission faced similar contention from mainly the southern EC states when it focused its attentions on prising open the ten per cent or so of the services market that was not voice telephony. A deal was reached at the end of 1989 between the Commission and EC governments for a strategy to introduce competition for what is known as value-added services, including electronic mail and data bases and the resale of data communication services from January next year. The commission was allowed to consider prolonging the resale of capacity of leased lines for those member-states whose network for packet switched data transmission services was not yet sufficiently developed. Member-states were also allowed to impose obligations on private service providers in the field of basic packet or circuit switched data transmission, if the activities of the private operator jeopardised the delivery of basic services. Even so, the package was quickly challenged in the Court of Justice by France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The judgment is not due until the end of the year. Liberalisation of the EC's telecommunications market is not possible without giving private operators access to the vast telecoms infrastructure. The basic principles of the open network framework directive, adopted in 1990, is the harmonisation of the technical characteristics of the EC's telephone networks, the conditions of their usage and tariff principles. The most important piece of legislation in the ONP framework adopted to date is a directive laying down the conditions for leased telephone lines. Two other proposals aimed at encouraging competition and beefing-up the quality of phone services and which will be significant for users were adopted by the Commission in July. The first proposal would introduce a common EC-wide licensing system for all providers of phone services. Once implemented, this will mean that companies approved to offer certain voice services in one EC country would automatically obtain the right to do business EC-wide. The second piece of legislation, the directive on open network provision for voice telephony, at the same time laid down basic guarantees for ordinary residential telephone service users but which also obliged government-run telephone companies to provide crucial inter-connection services for outside operators. The directive also set minimum quality standards to be provided by member-states on services such as the length of time to install a new telephone and minimum compensation rules if the services are not provided. Opposition from France and other EC governments to Commission plans to open up to competition - even a fraction - of voice telephony services, stems from the belief that only by maintaining large monopolies will Europe be able to fight off Japanese end American infiltration of the market. 'We are not against liberalisation, but we feel the aim should be the creation of a European telecommunications network,' said Bruno Janet, spokesman for France Telecom, pointing to the creation last September of a European network for data transmissions between several of the EC's telephone monopolies. His company points to the relative health of the EC's telecommunications sector where profits increased from Ecu 91m in 1978 to Ecu 383m in 1991, as proof that there is no need to hurry in deregulation. Even under British Telecom's own reckoning, French telephone tariffs are the lowest in Europe. France is also arguing that unless a strategy for the liberalisation of the whole of the voice telephony sector is worked out, it will be private telephone subscribers - who lack the vociferous lobbies of business users - who lose out. Europe's telephone companies tend to finance less profitable services with the money-spinning international calls sector. They are calling for more time and 'greater reflection.' What is certain is that however much the EC's Competition Commissioner, Sir Leon Brittan, would like otherwise, total deregulation of voice telephony in the EC is still a long way off.</p>

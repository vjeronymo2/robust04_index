			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Bond market puts pressure on US stocks Wall Street Most US share prices slipped yesterday as a weak dollar triggered further declines in the bond market, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 3.89 lower at 3,751.22, while the more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was down 1.37 at 462.31. Volume on the Big Board was a light 235m shares, as declining issues led advances by a four-to-three margin. In the secondary markets, the American SE composite was up a scant 0.32 at 445.77, but the Nasdaq composite had dipped 0.14 to close at 742.29. Stocks were set back for the fourth straight session as investors eyed developments in the foreign exchange markets with concern. The dollar lost further ground against the yen and D-mark amid doubts over US-Japanese trade talks and sagging confidence in the Clinton administration. The weak dollar in turn unsettled the Treasury market, where bonds posted heavy losses. With no fresh economic data on offer to brighten the picture, share prices opened with moderate losses, but they managed to improve slightly during the afternoon. Cyclical issues across the board posted small losses, as fall-out over last week's move to higher interest rates showed no sign of abating. One exception was 3M, up Dollars 1 at Dollars 55. Eli Lilly shed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 on a report that Glaxo was interested in buying a piece of the drug maker's business rather than acquiring the entire company. On the Nasdaq, Novell gave back Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 14 on the heels of a profits warnings issued late Friday. Neutrogena jumped Dollars 6 1/4 to Dollars 34 3/4 after Johnson&amp;Johnson agreed to buy the soap and shampoo company for Dollars 35 1/4 a share. J&amp;J edged Dollars  1/8 lower to Dollars 49 1/8 . Canada Toronto stocks ended steady for the second straight session, in quiet trading. The TSE-300 composite edged down 0.66 points, or 0.02 per cent, to 4,186.42, with declines leading advances by 370 to 327. Mexico The stock market soared and the peso strengthened against the dollar as investors cheered the apparent victory of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party in Sunday's presidential election, signalling a continuation of the government's free-market policies. The key IPC index of 37 leading shares closed up 50.79 points, or 1.88 per cent, to 2,758.97. The new peso firmed 2.5 centavos to close same-day trading at 3.3380/3280 new pesos against the dollar. Mexican stocks had rallied both in Mexico City and in New York in recent weeks as polls showed Mr Ernesto Zedillo heading for victory. On Monday, shares in Telefonos de Mexico were the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange, rising Dollars 1.25 to Dollars 66.625. Brazil Sao Paulo rallied for the seventh straight session to close up 4.8 per cent in heavy trade after bullish news on the presidential race sparked a strong buying bout by foreign and domestic investors. The Bovespa index of the 56 most-active shares ended up 2,475 at 53,858 points. On the Rio bourse, the ISENN surged 4.0 per cent to 20,782 points.

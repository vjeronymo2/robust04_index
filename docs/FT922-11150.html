			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Seeking a growth path out of apartheid: The minister charged with facilitating the economics of transition IF OFFERED an hour with the cabinet minister of their choice, most South African businessmen would probably choose Derek Keys. The combination of a successful private sector career, an engaging though forthright personality, and stewardship of a ministry critical to South Africa's hopes for economic growth are the reasons Mr Keys would probably be placed ahead of other influential figures, including (until his resignation at the weekend) Mr Barend du Plessis, the finance minister. Indeed, there is already speculation that Mr Keys might succeed Mr Du Plessis, who stepped down pleading exhaustion after eight gruelling years. Many in the business community, however, would want Mr Keys, minister of trade, industry and economic co-ordination, to stay where he is. Mr Du Plessis' resignation in effect marks the end of an era of siege economics. Now the priority is growth. Nobody disputes that if political transition is to succeed, the economy will have to be put onto a higher growth path to arrest the trend of declining living standards. Three months into his tenure at trade, industry and economic co-ordination, Mr Keys has begun to elaborate how he is approaching his task. He brings to it the same minimalist style which characterised his time as chairman of the mining house Gencor. In his maiden speech to parliament, Mr Keys said the issue he was prepared to become obsessed by - and the reason for his accepting the job - was how to raise the level of investment in new productive capacity, as a means of stimulating growth and job creation. The premise of his analysis is that the South African economy is basically sound and hence does not require dramatic measures to put it on to a higher growth path. What is needed, he argued in an interview recently, to realise this latent potential is investor confidence. Mr Keys believes this is essentially the province of the private sector. He singles out only two tasks here for government: that it should be consistent and transparent in its policies, and that it should be seen to be going in to bat for local business abroad. Two concerns arise about this analysis. Is Mr Keys doing enough to stimulate economic growth, and should he not be giving more attention to the productivity of the civil service, and of government spending in general? Mr Keys certainly has support for his 'steady as she goes' approach. Mr Michael O'Dowd, executive director of Anglo American Corporation, the country's biggest business group, argued recently that 'So far from being a 'basket case', the performance of the South African economy in conditions of great adversity has, in recent years, been most impressive.' He says, and Mr Keys would agree, that what is needed is more of what is already under way: reduction of tariffs to boost exports, deregulation and a lowering of inflation. Certainly, those looking for a package of stimulatory measures from Mr Keys are going to be disappointed. Although he accepts the case for a downward trend in tariffs, he is not planning any dramatic cuts, arguing that the country's tariff barriers, in general, are not high. He does not give much prominence to privatisation, saying that there are not suitable candidates at the ready, and is silent on the issue of tax reform, though the government is committed to lowering corporate and individual tax rates. On industrial policy, he prefers the idea of an incremental approach, 'choosing winners', rather than blanket measures to stimulate industry. Mr Keys argues that a shopping list of policy initiatives is unnecessary. 'The economy is as strong as a horse, but it's got too many jockeys at the moment. Government is sitting facing forwards, hoping the horse will start off moving. The ANC is on it, facing backwards, trying to get the horse to move backwards. Cosatu (the country's dominant union grouping) is sitting on sideways, hoping to claim the credit regardless of whether it goes forwards or backwards. The private sector is standing holding the horse's reins, but it is bemused by what is happening on top of the horse. I see my job as simply persuading the private sector to start putting one foot in front of the other and to start leading the horse, regardless of what the jockeys think they are doing.' Despite the confusion among the jockeys, Mr Keys believes there is a 'remarkable degree of economic convergence' between the main political actors. His sanguine view of South Africa's future economic policy is based on the belief that there is growing consensus across the world about what constitute sound economic policies. 'We're in a world which is founded on those principles and to key an open economy like South Africa's into that world pretty well determines what kind of internal policy you're going to have.' On discordant noises continuing to emanate from the ANC about economic policy, Mr Keys says: 'There has never been an unsatisfactory statement out of the ANC in a situation that has involved dialogue. Wherever there has been dialogue we've found that people can get onto the same wavelength.' Pressed as to how the government would respond if, for example, the ANC remained committed to nationalisation, Mr Keys suggests that this could delay the arrival of a transitional government. Perhaps a more important concern is supervision of state spending and the civil service. Mr Keys's predecessor Wim de Villiers had authority over these areas, but they are not part of Mr Keys' portfolio and he believes his energies are better harnessed elsewhere. But there is still widespread consensus that the state is getting poor results for the money it spends. There is, of course, good reason for Mr Keys not to become involved in any overhaul of the civil service. It is a political hot potato: it is dominated by Afrikaners, and any programme to axe jobs would be painful for a government already concerned by the erosion of support among its traditional supporters. Many would argue, however, that the government cannot allow possible achievements on the growth side of the economy to be undermined by overspending in the state bureaucracy.</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Managers' top pay in hospitals is Pounds 95,000 Britain's best paid hospital manager earned Pounds 95,000 last year, but was still worse off than counterparts in industry or commerce, says a survey published yesterday. Pay of National Health Service managers has become subject to frequent political criticism since the government's health reforms gave trust hospital boards freedom to decide salaries locally. The survey of 174 NHS trusts shows that chief executives of the country's biggest hospitals - handling annual budgets of more than Pounds 110m - earned between Pounds 75,000 and Pounds 95,000 including performance-related bonuses in 1993-94. There were, however, few managers at this earnings level  -only six chief executives received more than Pounds 80,000. While such salaries are good by public-sector standards, the NHS Trust Federation, which represents trust managements and undertook the survey, says that 'in business the top manager of a similar-sized operation would expect total earnings to be more than Pounds 123,000'. According to the survey chief executives of typical hospitals - with budgets of Pounds 50m and several thousand staff - earned an average of Pounds 59,000. The federation says this compares with remuneration packages of Pounds 107,000 for chief executives of similar-sized private sector companies. The figures are likely to rise this financial year as more trust chief executives become eligible for performance-related pay. It was worth an average 7 per cent to the 70 per cent of chief executives who benefited last year. Almost 80 per cent of trust chief executives are shown to be on fixed-term contracts. Although the provision of cars for NHS managers has caused political controversy, the survey shows that 85 per cent of chief executives either provide their own or make personal contributions to running their office cars.</p>

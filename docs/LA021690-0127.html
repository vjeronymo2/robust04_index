			<p><P> February 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL;  </P> <P> TEACHER-DISTRICT TALKS BREAK DOWN  </P> <P> Two days of intense contract talks between teachers and officials of the  Capistrano Unified School District broke down unexpectedly this week, despite  hopes that a state mediator would help end an eight-month impasse.  </P> <P> No new talks have been scheduled between district officials and negotiators for  the 100-member Capistrano Unified Educators Assn., officials for the two sides  said on Thursday.  </P> <P> "As of last night, we are back to square one," union president Ric Stephenson,  a history teacher at Newhart Junior High School, said of the meetings that  ended Wednesday night. "If we cannot resolve this at the mediation level, then  we will have to take action that will have an effect on the classroom."  </P> <P> He declined to elaborate, although teachers have picketed a district health  fair and Dana Hills High School in recent months to express their frustration  over the contract talks.  </P> <P> The state mediator was asked in January to assist in ongoing negotiations, and  this week's meetings were the first of both sides with the mediator.  </P> <P> The union wants increased health and retirement benefits and an 8%  across-the-board salary raise for this school year. The district has offered a  7.5% wage increase and wants a disciplinary clause included in the new  contract.  </P> <P> The clause would establish a panel to handle disciplinary action against  teachers. School principals now deal with disciplinary actions on a  case-by-case basis. Stephenson said the two sides reached agreement on the  clause, and were within a half percentage point on salary.  </P> <P> Jacqueline Cerra, spokeswoman for the 23,000-student district, said officials  were "very pleased with the progress of the last few days," but were  disappointed that they were unable to agree on a contract.

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Economic Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(b)(2) of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific data available and to consider the economic impact and any other relevant impact of specifying any particular area as critical habitat. The Secretary may exclude any area from critical habitat if he determines that the benefits of such exclusions outweigh the benefits of specifying such area as part of the critical habitat, unless it is determined, based on the best scientific and commercial data available, that the failure to designate such area as critical habitat would result in the extinction of the species concerned. The Act thus requires the Service to evaluate those economic and other effects likely to take place due to the designation of critical habitat, and to consider whether to exclude some critical habitat.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic effects of designating critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo are the project-related costs of habitat mitigation within the 10 areas designated as critical habitat over and above those costs incurred as a result of listing the vireo as an endangered species in May 1986 and as a result of compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act for those activities involving the placement of fill into waters of the United States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Affected Agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service assumes in the economic analysis that the impacts to Federal agencies are related to activities that physically alter critical habitat. The Forest Service, Corps of Engineers (Corps), Federal Highway Administration, and International Boundary and Water Commission are the agencies most likely to be affected by the critical habitat designation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Economic Effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Activities that may be affected include construction and maintenance of dams, water control and transport, fire suppression, recreation, oil and gas production and transport, sand-mining, residential and commercial development and related facilities, agriculture, and highway and bridge construction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Private lands within critical habitat (15,961 acres) are currently used primarily for agricultural purposes and are not expected to be economically affected. There are no known proposals with Federal involvement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous Federal, State, and local agencies have jurisdiction over the affected activities. Several informed the Service that critical habitat designation is consistent or compatible with their management objectives. Although a number of agencies expressed concern that the designation of critical habitat would affect proposed or future projects and asked to have various project areas removed, the economic costs attributable to critical habitat for those projects are expected to be insignificant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies expected to incur economic costs attributable to designation of critical habitat include the Forest Service, Corps of Engineers, and the International Boundary and Water Commission. The Forest Service anticipates an increased cost of $2,000 per year for additional fire suppression activities and $1,000 per year for additional ranger patrols to protect vireo habitat in the Santa Ynez River critical habitat area. It may become necessary for the Corps of Engineers to initiate patrols of its land in the Santa Ana River critical habitat area to control trespassing, at an anticipated cost of $20,000 a year. The Service believes that the International Boundary and Water Commission flood control activities in the Tijuana River area will incur no significant economic costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Construction of the Hamner Avenue Bridge in the Santa Ana River area was completed in 1985. The project included a compensation package for adverse effects to wildlife and wetlands that cost a total of $462,000, of which $113,400 was for cowbird control and nest monitoring to compensate for impacts to vireo habitat. The annualized value of the critical habitat effect is $8,000 per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of projects may incur economic costs because critical habitat designation is expected in some cases to require habitat mitigation or compensation that goes beyond current requirements. Under current procedures, whenever proposed projects affect wetlands, the proposing agency is required to replace habitat values either concurrently (up to 5 acres replaced for every 1 acre lost) or prior to their destruction (1 acre replaced for every 1 acre lost). In most cases, the agencies have chosen to replace the habitat values concurrently in order to avoid expensive project delays. With critical habitat designation, the Service expects in some cases to require replacement of habitat values prior to implementation of the action. The Service anticipates that the maximum additional cost would be $75,000 per acre for replacement of vireo habitat values prior to their destruction rather than concurrently. The incremental cost is due primarily to the need for additional landscaping and revegetation to create fully functional vireo habitat in a 2 to 3-year period. The cost of land acquired for mitigation purposes in such cases is attributable to the provisions of the Clean Water Act, or other laws and regulations protecting the environment. In some cases where land values are high, the total cost per acre of habitat destroyed may be less for prior replacement than for concurrent replacement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposed road crossing of the San Diego River associated with the Mission Trails Regional Park could adversely affect critical habitat. The project is still in the planning stage and the exact amount of habitat that would be affected is not known. The Service estimates that up to 5 acres of habitat may need to be replaced. At $75,000 per acre, an additional cost of $375,000 would be required for prior replacement of lost vireo habitat values. The annualized equivalent of the $375,000 one-time cost is $27,000 per year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

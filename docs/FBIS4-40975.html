			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Federation Council's debate on the dispatch of  Russian peacekeeping forces to the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict is one of the most important events of the day. The  decision was adopted by a majority of votes.    [Correspondent Marina Vasilyeva] Today's session of the  Federation Council began with a debate on the possibility of  using the Russian Armed Forces for the peacekeeping operation in  the zone of the Georgian-Abkhaz conflict. The debate, held  behind closed doors, lasted over an hour. The president's edict  was ratified as a result. Journalists learned of this first  from Pavel Grachev, who represented the Russian president at the  session.    [Begin Grachev recording] The Federation Council has adopted  a positive decision. The debate was conducted in a proper  manner. The motion won an absolute majority. Seven deputies  abstained and another seven were against. All the rest voted  for the peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia. This is a sign --  or, for me, an order -- to get started. In literally two or  three days' time, once Colonel General Kuznetsov has reported to  me that all engineering and mine clearance work has been  completed, we will start on the peacekeeping operation proper --  in other words, the deployment of outposts, checkpoints,  observation points, command points. We will start work. [end  recording]    [Vasilyeva] The decision that was adopted gives the go-ahead  for a contingent of the Russian Armed Forces, numbering up to  3,000 volunteers, to be used in the peacekeeping operation, with  an initial mandate of six months. Committees of the Federation  Council have been instructed to supervise the implementation of  this decision.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Borislav Mikelic, prime minister-designate </F> of the republic of Serbian Krajina, by Zivojin Jerotijevic; in  Belgrade -- live]    [Excerpts] [Jerotijevic] Mr. Mikelic, since we know that  you are in a hurry tell us briefly what solutions do you have in  store as prime minister-designate?    [Mikelic] After three months, since the second round of  elections in the republic of Serbian Krajina [RSK] and a little  over a month since I have been appointed the prime  minister-designate of the republic of Serbian Krajina, now on  the eve of the assembly session which will take place on 20  April, we have found possibilities to form the government of  national unity for which I have been striving from the very  beginning. I must say that really a lot of effort and patience  has been invested to coordinate views. [passage omitted]    I am glad that Dr. Babic has risen above the signing of the  parliamentary coalition and agreed to the formation of the  government of national unity. This means that he has placed the  national interest and the interest of the people above the  advantages of a parliamentary coalition. We have coordinated  the approach toward the formation of the government of national  unity entirely, be it regarding the ministries or personnel  fine-tuning. What is probably the most important for the  listeners of Radio Belgrade and Argument Vise [Argument More]  program is that I have accomplished full accord on all issues  with [word indistinct] Krajina, that is to say, Dr. Milan Babic.  [passage omitted]    To point out some of the names, I can say that Dr. Milan  Babic will be foreign minister, Ilija Price interior minister,  and Dr. Rade Tanjga defense minister, while Dr. Branko Petrovic  will be economics minister. [Words indistinct] for me to  enumerate them here.    [Jerotijevic] In any case, thanks a lot. The listeners of  Argument Vise program had the opportunity to hear the first, at  least, of some of the names of ministers, that is to say, the  names of the ministers that seem to be the most important. Have  a good trip, Mr. Mikelic.    [Mikelic] Thank you!</p>

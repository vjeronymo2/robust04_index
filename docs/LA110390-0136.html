He replaces fired bullpen  coach Denny Sommers.  </P> <P> Sommers has received an offer to remain in the organization as an advance  scout, but he has not made a decision. Sommers is the 30th front-office  employee or coach who has been fired since Sept. 21.  </P> <P> Kimm, 39, a former major league catcher, was an extra coach on Jim Leyland's  staff the past two seasons. He kept scouting charts during the games while  sitting in the stands as the Pirates' major league coordinator of instruction.  </P> <P> Padre Manager Greg Riddoch met Kimm when he was in the Cincinnati Red  organization as a minor league manager and major league coach. Riddoch  interviewed Kimm Thursday in Denver and offered him the job Friday.  </P> <P> "I'm just ecstatic about the staff we've put together," Riddoch said.  </P> <P> The Padre coaching staff for the 1991 season consists of Mike Roarke, pitching  coach; Merv Rettenmund, hitting coach; Jim Snyder, bench coach; Rob Picciolo,  first base coach, and Kimm.

Gorbatov, researcher at the Center for </F> Socioeconomic Research of the Youth Institute: "Refugees--Moscow  Is a Big Railway Station"]    [Text] Logic suggests: Before talking about a problem, and  especially before intending to solve it, it is necessary to  picture the scale of it. As for refugees, objective statistics  are lacking, both for all of Russia and for the Moscow region.  At first glance the reasons are simple: There is no control over  movement across the border from former Union republics (except  for the Baltics), and there are no clear-cut legal norms.  According to the law of the Russian Federation on the status of  refugees, adopted in the summer of last year, only citizens of  other states can be considered as such. This means that persons  who arrive in Central Russia from zones of ethnic conflict,  which are within the boundaries of the territory of the Russian  Federation (Chechnya, Ossetia, Ingushetia, and others), cannot  obtain the status of refugee. They are called either resettlers  or displaced persons, but the essence does not change because of  this. It turns out that there are many more refugees than  recorded.    Although, strictly speaking, the figures are still  terrifying. According to data of the MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] of the Russian Federation, more than 9,000 refugees  were counted at the end of 1993 in Moscow and Moscow Oblast, of  which 3,600 are concentrated right in our city, and 5,500 in the  oblast. This figure does not include those who are living here  in an "illegal" status. Expert estimates in this regard are  rather contradictory, and vary from several to hundreds of  thousands. They cannot be used as objective information for an  analysis of the economic status of refugees. Therefore, the data  cited further apply only to persons who officially have the  status of refugees.    The Moscow region, fortunately for its residents, was never  "open" to migrants, rather strict restrictions existed  associated with residence permits. Nevertheless, the population  of the capital has grown steadily from year to year precisely  owing to migrants. Now, despite the decree of the Government of  Moscow concerning toughening passport control and the  introduction of duties on the right to stay in the city, the  number of refugees and displaced persons on its territory is  increasing. In 1992, 2,500 refugees were counted here, and now  the number is significantly higher. We are talking only about  people who use official channels to acquire the right to live in  Moscow.    Why is the capital so attractive? For a majority of those  who  arrive in the Moscow region (61.7 percent), the presence here of  institutions and organizations that can solve their problems is  important. Thirty-seven percent of this group declare that they  would like to get authorization to go abroad. So, for a large  part of the arriving refugees Moscow represents a kind of  transshipment point. In addition, it should be noted that there  is quite a large number of commercially inclined persons for  whom the presence of conflict on interethnic grounds is only a  reason for legal resettlement from regions with an unstable  political and economic situation in a city, which for them is a  "gold mine" (15 percent on average).    But on the whole the economic situation of the refugees in  the Moscow region, really, like everywhere, is unenviable. Many  (24.6 percent) live in crowded material conditions. The main  official sources of their existence are state allowances and  assistance from relatives (26.8 percent, on the average). Only  22.7 percent have stable earnings. Fewer have permanent  work--only 3 percent of them, and 32 percent of the able-bodied  do not work at all. However paradoxical, their misfortune is  that they do have...a higher and secondary special education (up  to 33 percent). In Moscow they encounter an already developed  infrastructure that is characterized by a great oversaturation  of this kind of specialist (four-fifths of all employees). This  problem has especially worsened now under conditions of  increased unemployment. At best, those who arrive can count on  work that is "not prestigious" to the local residents. Despite  the significant share of those who would like to change  specialties so that they could find work in the Moscow region  (up to 38 percent), there are also those who under no  circumstances (18.5 percent) want to engage in work that is "not  according to their specialization," and, as a rule, this is the  intelligentsia (80 percent from this group).    But, in addition to work and obtaining the means for  existence, the problem of housing is becoming even more  critical. At the present time 28 percent of them are forced to  rent housing, and 650 [as published] percent take shelter with  relatives. The housing situation for 40.5 percent of the  refugees is simply intolerable. Of course, it is necessary to  feel sorry for them. But in our region hundreds of thousands "of  our own" families are standing in line to receive housing. But  not many people (2 percent) can allow themselves to buy an  apartment, given today's high prices. So, the question stands  this way: Either leave the region, or buy housing. Therefore,  many of them (43 percent) plan to sell their apartment in their  previous place of residence and acquire one within the  boundaries of the Moscow region. However, not everyone by far  has something to sell (20 percent, on average). It is even more  difficult with residence permits. But it is what makes it  possible to use the social benefits (acquiring a free education,  material allowances, etc.). It is practically impossible to get  a residence permit without acquiring housing in Moscow. The  percentage of those without residence permits in Moscow, and  this means in many ways "people without social rights," is the  highest in Russia (48.3 percent of the refugees living on its  territory).    The most vulnerable people in this situation are children  and  pensioners. A majority of families, of course, need material  assistance for the children on the part of the local authorities  and the state. There is not enough money for clothes and  normal nourishment. Pensioners cannot get pensions and other  benefits due them because of difficulties in transferring  documents from their previous place of residence. The loss of  documents complicates the situation in many ways, and a search  for them is hampered or impossible because of the tense  political situation between Russia and a number of republics.  Without residence permits it is also difficult to use medical  services, which very tangibly hits an already meager budget.    A lot has been written about the difficult economic  situation  of the refugees, but the issue of ways to resolve the problem  remains open to the present time. This in many ways depends on  the presence in the state of a good national program of  resettling refugees on the territory of the country. Such an  attempt was undertaken at the end of 1991 by the Government of  Russia--the "Migration" program was adopted. But...it remained  mainly on paper. It appears that it is aimed more at the  resolution of questions of providing cheap manpower and  developing the regions of the non-Chernozem, Siberia, and the  Far East. Alas, the interests of the state, and not the  refugees, emerged as the priority. A serious review is needed of  the principal provisions of the program. After all, besides  everything else, its implementation in its previous form  requires large material resources, whose allocation, based on  the difficult economic conditions, does not seem possible. But  despite all this, uncontrolled migration pressure on the  European region of Russia, including on the Moscow region,  continues to increase.    The attempts of the Government of Moscow to protect its  region from such pressure, using old methods (toughening the  rules of passport control), have an unhealthy effect on Russian  refugees most of all. After all, persons of other nationalities  who come to Moscow can count on the assistance of various  friendly associations of their own people that exist here  (Azerbaijani Chechen, Armenian, etc.), which help their  fellow-countrymen overcome the "barrier" of residence  registration legally as well as illegally. Therefore, only the  Russians are thrown to the whims of fate. It is no accident that  Russian refugees are experiencing the greatest economic  difficulties in their own "historic motherland."    It is apparent that previous experience in the regulation of  migratory streams cannot be used to resolve refugee problems.  While their appearance in Russia is in many ways a new  phenomenon (we have not had refugees since 1924), it is not new  as such to many countries of West Europe and America. They have  accumulated a wealth of multifaceted experience in this regard,  and it would not be out of place to utilize it. The more so in  that under conditions of a threat of mass migration from the  former USSR to the countries of West Europe (30 percent owing to  refugees), they are eagerly ready to help.    There is a special decree of a parliamentary meeting of the  European Community adopted in February 1993 "Concerning the  Migratory Movement of the Population between the States of the  Former USSR," and recommendations attached to it, according to  which Russia can count on the rendering of assistance to  refugees and displaced persons on its territory. Of course, now  the problem lies not so much in money as in necessary meaningful  aspects of the national program for rendering assistance to  refugees and forced migrants. The creation of a network of  nonstate social services, aimed at refugees, can be viewed as a  promising direction in the resolution of this problem. These  organizations, which are not dependent on state structures and  not subordinate to them, whose source of existence will become  not budgetary resources but subsidies from various charitable  funds, including international, should work on those questions  that state services refuse to work on (offering juridical  services, searching for housing, retraining, searching for  employment, etc.). They will be able organically to supplement  the work of state services. There are already quite a few of  them in the countries of Western Europe. For example, there are  about 60 in Great Britain alone (of these, four work on a  nationwide scale and 56 are small local organizations). Seventy  percent of the total number of these organizations are  concentrated in London, which is very similar to Moscow in the  nature of the problem in this respect. Now the employees of our  center, together with colleagues from Great Britain, are  conducting work on a joint project whose purpose is to  accumulate British experience in work with refugees and use it  in a plan to develop nonstate social services in Russia  (including in Moscow).    In our opinion, another no less promising direction in the  resolution of the refugee problem could be the establishment of  a network of centers for refugee professional retraining, taking  into account the requirements of regional labor markets. The  specific nature of the work with refugees and forced migrants  lies in the fact that the status of "refugee" is itself  temporary. Many of those who were questioned would like to go  back and continue to work in their former specialty, given a  stabilization of the situation in the region of their former  residence. Therefore, the content of the programs for the  retraining of refugees should reflect universality and  differentiation. In acquiring a new specialty, the previous one  should not be lost. Ignoring the previous work experience of  refugees is an unnecessary loss of time and resources. At the  same time, the experience of Germany, France, and Great Britain  is being used widely.</p>

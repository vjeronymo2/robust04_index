			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Capital Markets: Luxembourg plans first public bond auction of 6 1/2 per cent 10-year bonds - on October 20. The Treasury has decided to start auctioning paper for greater visibility and liquidity, an official said. Luxembourg has traditionally issued its government bonds via bank syndicates. Although he declined to disclose the likely size of the forthcoming issue, he said it may be announced closer to the auction date. The Treasury plans to hold monthly auctions at which all banks licensed to do business in Luxembourg can bid. The method of issuing bonds will be similar to the Belgian system, where linear bonds with standardised maturity dates and coupons but variable amounts are auctioned every month. Unlike Belgium, however, Luxembourg will not have a system of primary dealers. Traders were surprised by the bond's coupon, which is some 90 basis points below the yield on Belgian 10-year bonds. Given the two currencies are tightly pegged, the yield gap mystified dealers and sparked speculation that Luxembourg may consider breaking its currency's link with the Belgian franc. While Luxembourg's ordinary budget is actually in surplus, the extraordinary budget, which includes one-off items such as infrastructure spending, means the country has to fund a small net deficit. The country's net budget deficit this year will be LFr1.8bn and is forecast at LFr1.9bn for 1994, the Treasury official said.</p>

			<p><P> July 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE BUDGET: WHAT THEY SAID  </P> <P> Here is a sampling of lawmakers' views on the state budget they debated on  Saturday:  </P> <P>  "I say it is a chewing gum and baling wire budget which stumbles along toward  a $3-billion deficit next year." -- Assemblyman Tom McClintock (R-Thousand  Oaks)  </P> <P> "This is certainly not our dream, our vision of California.  </P> <P> But we are taking the recommendation of our leader." -- Assemblyman Mike Roos  (D-Los Angeles)  </P> <P> "(This budget) stinks, but vote yes. Give George Deukmejian his legacy." --  Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La Mesa)  </P> <P> "Pass this bloated budget and its unconscionable tax increases, and the voters  are going to strike back the only way they can: with a limitation of  (legislative) terms." -- Sen. John Doolittle (R-Rocklin)  </P> <P> "I guess this budget can't be all that bad because nobody likes it." -- Sen.  Dan Boatwright (D-Concord)  </P> <P> "For all of us, it's a love-hate budget." -- Assemblyman Barry Keene  (D-Benicia)  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Luis Donaldo Colosio, presidential candidate for the  Institutional Revolutionary Party [PRI], condemned today's  events in four municipalities of Chiapas State, where members of  the so-called Zapata National Liberation Army [EZLN] have staged  violent clashes. The PRI candidate said there is nothing to  justify jeopardizing the lives of the inhabitants of these  municipalities or threatening their peaceful coexistence. Luis  Donaldo Colosio issued a press bulletin saying he was convinced  that violence is not the way to solve poverty.    The Confederation of Labor Organizations condemned Bishop  Samuel Ruiz and his close supporters as well as the armed groups  for having acted irresponsibly during the last few days in  Chiapas. The organization says that the church has been the  main player in many of the confrontations between the Indian  community and the government, thus endangering human lives.  According to a document issued in Tuxtla Gutierrez, the three  Chiapas bishops reaffirmed their willingness to serve as  mediators in the conflict between the EZLN and the authorities.  In the first point of a communique, the three bishops of  Chiapas State, Felipe Aguirre Franco, Felipe Arizmendi Esqivel,  and Samuel Ruiz Garcia, offer their mediation based on the  church's moral recognition in the region.</p>

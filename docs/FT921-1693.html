			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Clinton urges reform of Congress GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, overwhelming favourite to be the Democratic party's presidential nominee, yesterday added his voice to the calls for reform in the way the US Congress does business, writes Jurek Martin. But he did so in a different way from President George Bush's demand that the solution lay in throwing out the Democrats from their long control of the legislature. Interviewed on TV, Mr Clinton agreed Congress was too entrenched in its way, was too subject to pressure from special interest groups, and probably enjoyed too many perks. But the real problem, he said, was the lack of a real partnership between the president and Congress. The Reagan and Bush administrations had been so intent on confrontation they had 'let Congress drift in an unfortunate way'. It was, he said, typical that Mr Bush should veto, as announced on Friday, the lastest economic reform package passed on Capitol Hill. It was a serious attempt to deal with economic problems and inappropriate to block it simply because it would have increased income taxes on the wealthiest Americans.</p>

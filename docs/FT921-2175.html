			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Lionheart sharply ahead at Pounds 2.63m Lionheart, the housewares, paint brushes and retail display equipment group formerly known as Spong, returned to the dividend list after a three-year absence for reconstruction. Pre-tax profits for 1991 amounted to Pounds 2.63m, sharply ahead of the previous year's Pounds 704,000. Turnover rose some 83 per cent to Pounds 32.3m (Pounds 17.6m). A dividend of 0.3p is proposed, payable from earnings per share of 1.3p (0.62p). This will cost nearly Pounds 1.6m and leave retained earnings of only Pounds 210,000, but comes after clearing preference dividend arrears of Pounds 1.03m to 12 institutions. The Cheshire-based group was formed from the rescue of Spong by Hillsdown, ECI and Scimitar in 1989, when Hillsdown paid Pounds 3.4m for an 8.7 per cent stake. Mr Paul Lever was recruited as chairman from Crown Paints, where he was chief executive. Mr Lever said gearing was only 10 per cent and the group was looking for more acquisitions to broaden its base of products sold through mass market outlets.</p>

			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Letter: Policies to lure capital back home Sir, Martin Wolf, in his most useful article, 'How to encourage flight capital to go back home' (May 4), does not mention two important aspects of the issue. First, most advocates of 'shock therapy' (for Russia as well as for other economies in transition) do not demand full legalisation of capital flows - that is, capital account convertibility. Rather, they recommend either that free two-way capital flows be completely excluded from liberalisation or that only capital inflows, not outflows, be 'allowed', or that capital account liberalisation be postponed until the very end of the reform sequence. These restrictions rather reduce capital inflows and, at the same time, contribute to the 'crippling outflow', as Mr Wolf rightly notes. However, it should be acknowledged that not only 'gradualists', but 'shock therapists' as well, are to blame for this. Moreover, part of the capital flowing out of Russia is likely to be of a criminal origin (corruption). Therefore, even with the removal of standard reasons for capital flight (such as interest rate spreads, confiscatory taxation, etc), at least some of the flight is unlikely ever to return home, contrary to what Mr Wolf seems to assume. In order to generate a full reversal of the outflows, policies need to over-compensate for the generically irreversible part of capital flight.

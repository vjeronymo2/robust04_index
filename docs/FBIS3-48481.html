			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN in Japanese 21 January 94 Morning </F> Edition]    [Text] The government plans to decide early next week on a  new package of measures to stimulate the economy, measures which  will focus on expanding Japan's imports. Major steps in the  package are: 1) to increase funds for the industrial  infrastructure in order to upgrade the existing import-related  infrastructure and the foreign access zone (FAZ); 2) to build  additional or expand existing import-related facilities --  including the General Import Promotion Center -- in an effort to  help foreign firms smoothly gain access to the Japanese market;  and 3) to strengthen the import promotion tax and import loan  system. Prime Minister Hosokawa expressed his intention last  December to expand Japan's imports, setting the "basic policy  for import expansion." The government plans to take these steps  on the eve of Japan-U.S. summit talks scheduled for February in  order to boost Japan's imports, with the aim of stressing  Japan's posture to cut its trade surplus with the United States.    In the new pump-priming package, the government intends to  upgrade the FAZ ahead of schedule, which is equipped with  storage and disposal functions at its ports and airports. The  government plans to add approximately 4 billion yen to the funds  for the industrial infrastructure to partially finance the cost  of constructing import-related complexes and installing  facilities there in six areas including the Kansai International  Airport and Kobe Port. The government also intends to make  preparations for securing sites in five areas where the  construction of import-related complexes were approved in 1993.    In the new package of stimulus measures, the government  plans  to construct more import-related facilities in a bid to help  foreign companies smoothly gain access to the Japanese market.  The government intends to additionally establish two general  import promotion centers where foreign firms are given free  offices and can display and sell their goods, as well as three  regional import promotion centers. The government also plans to  establish four imported housing exhibition centers.    The government believes upgrading the existing  import-related  infrastructure and facilities will greatly contribute to  expanding Japan's imports of manufactured goods. The Ministry  of International Trade and Industry, which intends to ask for a  total of 10 billion yen in the third supplementary budget, is  now negotiating with the Ministry of Finance.    In the new stimulus package, the government will strengthen  the preferential tax system and the policy loan system for both  foreign firms eager to invest in Japan as well as Japanese  importers. As for the import tax system for Japanese  manufacturers and wholesalers who import foreign manufactured  goods, the government will keep the system in effect after the  end of March 1995. Imported housing, some auto parts, and other  items which the multilateral trade negotiations (the Uruguay  Round of GATT) decided to abolish duties on immediately, will be  subject to tax deductions. The government plans to establish a  preferential tax system during 1994 under which a certain ratio  of the taxes from increased sales by foreign firms in Japan over  the previous year is deducted.    The Japan Development Bank established the loan system in  late December 1993 for the import promotion and strengthening of  the infrastructure, and the government will ask the Small  Business Finance Corporation to extend the loan system for  smooth import and sales by the end of March 1995.</p>

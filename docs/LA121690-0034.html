			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> TICKET TO RIDE: Michael Jackson -- and his close adviser, David Geffen -- are  on the move again. Although no one's talking on the record, several inside  sources say that Jackson/Geffen are in the process of finding a new home for  Jackson's mega-million ATV Music publishing company.  </P> <P> The firm, which owns a wealth of valuable catalogues, most notably the Beatles'  hits, has been administered by EMI Music, one of the industry's largest  publishing firms. But Jackson and Geffen (who sold his record company to MCA  Inc. earlier this year) are in negotiations with MCA Music, despite the fact  that MCA has a much smaller worldwide publishing network. The deal could mean  an additional $1 million annually in revenue for MCA -- and a big boost in  prestige. (Most music publishers get 15% to 20% of the profits in an  administration deal, though MCA will get a considerably smaller percentage  because of Jackson's superstar status.) However, the news isn't all bad for  EMI. It may be losing the Gloved One, but it's winning the battle to land Rod  Stewart's much-coveted publishing catalogue, which had been at Warner-Chappell  Music.  </P></p>

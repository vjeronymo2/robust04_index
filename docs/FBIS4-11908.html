			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["From the Heart" column by Ghazi al-'Ayyash: "Iraq's Curse"] </F>   [Text] A note to the reader: The Iraqi people have a high  measure of pride and enjoy strong values. Therefore, it is  perfectly in character for them not to reflect on small deeds  and spiteful acts by their enemies when those enemies fall into  the trap of their own evil or receive a dire, divine punishment.  Hence, we have not gloated over what has happened to the  criminals who planned and carried out the 30-state aggression,  thus demonstrating the most remarkable degree of moral nobility.  However, the truly Iraqi, Ghazi al-'Ayyash, unlike the rest of  the Iraqis, could no longer tolerate the kind and magnitude of  the crimes of the enemies of humanity. So he wrote the  following lines that express legitimate human feelings.    [Signed: the Chief Editor]    The collapse of former British Prime Minister Margaret  Thatcher in Santiago, Chile, was not the first such incident for  one of the symbols of the 30-state aggression against Iraq.  Former U.S. President George Bush had earlier fainted in Tokyo,  Japan. Both collapsed in front of television cameras worldwide,  just as bulls collapse when they are about to enter a  slaughterhouse and approach their end. George Bush collapsed  like a worn bull that fought in battles too great for him.  Margaret Thatcher fell and her head drooped like a sick sheep  falling under the feet of its herd.    Here, we are not gloating, nor praying to God for the death  of George Bush, Margaret Thatcher, or others whose hands were  smeared with the blood of the innocent Iraqis, those who had a  hand in imposing an unjust embargo against the Iraqi people, or  those who denied Iraqi children and sick people food and  medicine, thus causing their death en masse. We have faith and  know that we are all going to die. However, we pray to God for  their long suffering and agony. We pray to God to infect them  with scabies that make their bodies itch constantly, denying  them sleep at night and the joys of life in daytime.    We pray to God to make those people lose their eyesight,  having lost their insight. We pray that their minds and tongues  be paralyzed, and that their hearts be rent over the death of  their most beloved ones. We pray that their spite will eat into  their bodies and those of their grandchildren. We pray they  lose their way in the desert, naked and barefoot, and look for a  drop of water but find only a mirage. We hope they are denied  everything they like, that they will never feel happy and that  they will lose their minds. We hope they will turn into a  laughable joke to amuse children. We hope adults will kick them  as well.    The curse of the Iraqis shall haunt them, just like the  curse  of the Pharaohs has been haunting those who infringe upon their  boundaries, sanctity, rights, and land. The curse of the Iraqis  has begun to haunt them, for mysterious diseases are eating away  their soldiers and earthquakes and volcanoes are destroying  American cities and the cities of other countries that took part  in the aggression against Iraq. Gorbachev has been overwhelmed  by the disgrace of the disintegration of the former Soviet Union  and the tribulations of its peoples. Shevardnadze, who was  foreign minister of the Soviet Union during the 30-state  aggression against Iraq and who contributed to this aggression,  is today crying over the rubble of his country, Georgia, and its  ordeal and is seeking shelter under the spears of the soldiers  of another country. British Prime Minister John Major is now  walking on thin ice. Any moment now, he could fall into a  bottomless abyss from which he will never return.    The symptoms of the Iraq curse have started to appear on  U.S.  President Bill Clinton. He still has not come up with a way to  handle the Whitewater scandal. The world economy is being shaken  and is about to collapse. The governments that contributed to  the aggression against Iraq have all fallen, haunted by the  curse of their scandals and their people's disavowal of them.  They have fallen into the abyss. Some of them are still  waiting. This is the inevitable fate of all tyrants and  despots. It is a natural outcome of what they did to a  faithful, peaceful people, the people of Iraq. The curse of the  Iraqis promises them more dire consequences.</p>

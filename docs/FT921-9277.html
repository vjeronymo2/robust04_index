			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Sudanese political trends alarm Cairo: Growing tensions between neighbours in north-east Africa WHEN Major-General al Zubeir Mohammed Saleh, Sudan's deputy leader, completed a visit to Egypt this week, he had soothing words about the strained relations between the neighbouring Arab-African states. 'Agreement had been reached,' he said, 'on the formation of a joint committee to promote co-operation in all fields for the good of the two peoples.' Behind his bland pronouncements, however, lies a troubled relationship, and it is doubtful that Gen al Zubeir's presence in Cairo - this was the highest-level Sudanese mission to Egypt in 18 months - has done all that much to calm festering Egyptian worries about developments in the Sudan. A senior Egyptian official, who described the whole issue of Egypt-Sudan relations as 'extremely sensitive,' said Cairo would 'wait and see how the Sudanese government is going to manage its relations in the Arab world, and how the 'fundamentalist non-Moslem wave' of policies there will manifest itself'. From Cairo's perspective, Sudan presents an alarming picture these days: a weak military regime in the thrall of a powerful fundamentalist tendency led by Dr Hassan al-Tourabi of the National Islamic Front, which, according to Egyptian claims, is bent on creating a militant Moslem state and haven for extremist groups from across the Arab world. Egypt's official Rose el-Yousef magazine this week published a detailed account, apparently based on Egyptian intelligence reports, of what it described as a network of terrorist training camps under Dr Tourabi's control. It also refered to the presence in Sudan of 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards, some of whom had served in Lebanon. Another Egyptian concern is over sanctuary given to Egyptian militants in Sudan recently, including the blind cleric, Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman who fled Egypt in 1990. A visit to Khartoum last December by President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani of Iran, accompanied by offers of military assistance, prompted an extraordinary outburst in Al Ahram, the official Cairo daily, by Ibrahim Nafeh, its editor-in-chief and confidant of President Hosni Mubarak. 'God help the brotherly Sudanese people,' Mr Nafeh wrote. 'For years, the situation in Sudan has been deteriorating, with governments changing hands consecutively until (Sudanese President Omar) Al Basir rose to power in a military coup d'etat and overshadowed all previous leaders in his blunt efforts to push Sudan down the drain.' Egypt's growing troubles with Sudan, which it ruled under an Anglo-Egyptian condominium until the early 1950s, date from the last idiosyncratic years of Colonel Jaafar Nimeiri's rule before his removal in a bloodless coup in 1985. Mr Nimeiri's efforts to impose Shari'a law (a 1,300- year-old Islamic code) had fuelled conflict between the mainly Moslem north and the Christian or animist south: a debilitating civil war continues to this day. His replacement after a transitional period of military rule by Mr Sadiq al-Mahdi as prime minister between 1986 and 1989 added to Egypt's problems with its neighbour. Mr Mahdi, a fervent nationalist, had little regard for the web of agreements negotiated over the years between Khartoum and Cairo, including an 'integration accord', and these were replaced with a 'Fraternity Charter' in 1987 - a largely meaningless agreement - that was designed to 'restore warmth' to the troubled relationship. Gen Saleh's visit to Cairo was dogged by a border dispute that was rekindled following the signing of an agreement last December between Sudan and a Canadian-registered company for oil exploration in a zone Egypt claims as its sovereign territory. He insisted that the control over what is known as the Halaib administrative triangle on the Egyptian Sudanese Red Sea border could be resolved amicably.</p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment, Ireland (5): People are often the main incentive - Inward investment WHEN tourists from around the world are asked which aspect of Ireland they enjoy the most, the answer is frequently: 'The people.' The same answer is often given by foreign executives when asked why they are pleased with their operations in 'the Emerald Isle.' There are 1,000 foreign companies in Ireland. A recent survey on what a sample of them like about the country showed 'people/ambience' at the top of the list, closely followed by qualities of the workforce, namely youth and skills. Ireland has been at pains to stress its young, highly-educated wealth of graduates, especially in technical disciplines. More than half the population is under the age of 28. About 60 per cent of Irish 18-year-olds are studying or undergoing a training course, compared with 35 per cent in Britain. The percentage of tertiary students pursuing engineering, science or business-related studies is also around the 60 figure. With the world recession, the 'migration' of so many bright young things to London and New York has tailed off as job opportunities in the megalopolises disappear. On the other hand, the current number of jobs in Ireland with foreign companies is 92,000 - nearly 10 per cent of the workforce. English being the main language is of course an advantage to the two largest foreign investors, the US and Britain, although it was mentioned only as something of an afterthought by the 14 respondents to the survey commissioned by Allied Irish Banks (AIB) International Corporate Banking. One in four - a surprisingly low percentage - said the generous tax concessions on offer for the next 15 years were a prime incentive to invest in Ireland. Corporation tax for manufacturing and some service industries is fixed at a maximum of 10 per cent until 2010, but five years earlier for financial institutions operating in Dublin's International Financial Services Centre (IFSC). Nobody seems to be looking beyond these magic dates at the moment, although managing director of the Industrial Development Authority, the chief promoter of inward investment in the country, Mr Kieran McGowan, envisages European community battles on levels of financial incentives. 'The EC is talking about a ceiling on these types of incentives,' said Mr McGowan.' We argue that small countries such as Ireland are disadvantaged in attracting industry, so should be able to offer extra benefits.' The largest foreign investor in Ireland is the US, with about 350 American companies having operations there. Here is an area, unlike tariffs, where all seems to be sweetness and light between the two countries. Mr Gene Harris, the commercial attache at the US Embassy in Dublin, says there is an undeniable cultural affinity - about 45m Americans have Irish ancestry, according to the latest census - but the preference is more hard headed than that. 'That figure of 350 represents a very high level of investment for the US,' he says. 'If you compare it with, say, Denmark, also a EC member, the company count there is only 185 and yet Denmark has twice the population of Ireland.' The US presence is in fact the highest per capita investment it has anywhere in the world. Mr Harris mentions the highly-trained labour force as a factor in US preference: 'I don't believe all the glowing IDA publicity, but I find when I ask American companies here what problems they have had there is a pause. They have to scratch their heads and think about it, whereas anywhere else in the world there seems to be an automatic litany of complaints as soon as you put that question.' Apple computers have had its most profitable operation anywhere, in Cork, according to Harris, although a big withdrawal recently suggests that this may not be much help to the company at the moment. Low labour costs have certainly helped the balance sheets of many companies. Taking Ireland as 100 units in a scale of comparative labour costs in Europe, it is nearly half as expensive as Germany (192) and has a definite advantage over Britain (117). Things have gone well for Coke in Ireland. The drinks company has had operations here since 1952, and Coca-Cola Atlantic was formed in 1974. The company recently announced a IPounds 127m expansion of its concentrate manufacturing plant in Drogheda, in the north-east of the republic, with 11,000 extra square metres and 140 new jobs over five years. A new company, Coca-Cola Reinsurance Services (CCRS), is also being set up in Dublin's IFSC. The company wIll provide insurance for all Coca-Cola properties outside the US and Canada. Maidenform, best-known as a bra maker, is one of dozens of foreign companies operating in the special industrial zone around Shannon, in the mid-west. Top secret information such as the average bust size of women in the 50 counties where Maidenform has markets is held here. Humdrum assembly and repackaging for Asian markets are other concerns. Other US developments include establishment of the European headquarters for Adam Spence, the medical components manufacturer, and a new laboratory for Carlow Associates of Virginia, which works in human factor and ergonomics studies. Adam Spence expects to create 50 jobs at its facility in Boyle, County Roscommon. Carlow will be looking for psychology and computer science graduates for its work, which entails investigations of errors and human performance. Its clients include the NASA space agency, the US Army and Navy, and the French Ministry of Defence. To date it has investigated the role played by human error in the Three Mile Island nuclear accident and studied the need for high-mounted braking lights on cars. The US is still the main focus of its attention, says Mr McGowan at the IDA, but a lot of effort is currently being put into wooing British and German interests, particularly in the financial services and software sectors. Japan has not been a target yet, although its representation is respectable, at 35 firms including Fujitsu (which has four plants), Atari, Hitachi, Brother and NEC. Korea has two operations in Ireland. Interest from that part of the world is also bearing fruit with a small number of Australian operations. There is already a financial presence, for example National Australia Bank's ownership of National Irish Bank, forerunner of a possible trend towards mergers and acquisitions rather than greenfield projects from foreign interests. Allied Smokeless Fuels, a Queensland company, is importing anthracite from Australia to process in Ireland and take advantage of the market created by smokeless fuel regulations around, for example, Dublin. Michel, an Australian leather goods company, has just agreed terms with the IDA on a IPounds 27m investment in a plant at Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, 'the leather capital of Europe', according to the IDA. The 23-year-old authority is an aggressive marketer of the advantages of locating in Ireland. Across the board, it now sees big opportunities in telemarketing, with the 340m consumers of the EC just on the doorstep. 'For telemarketing, all you need is, one, people, and two, telephones, and we feel we have particular strengths in both areas, ' said Mr McGowan. The authority is working closely with Telecom Eireann to develop this market, and Telecom claims an investment of Pounds 3.5bn in digital and fibre-optic technology will make it a leading competitor. Electronics and pharmaceuticals have been two strong areas for foreign investment. Here again availability of local staff skilled in electrical engineering and chemistry is attractive. Sectors which Ireland is concentrating on are financial services and software. The IFSC, a 1980s glass and towers project in Dublin's equivalent of London's Docklands, has had reasonable success in attracting tenants.</p>

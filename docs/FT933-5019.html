			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Hysteria at the Royal Court - Theatre ALMOST the best line in the new play at the Royal Court is the first. The central character sits motionless in his chair long enough to be convicted of hamming. Then he opens with: 'If you are waiting for me to break the silence, you will be deeply disappointed.' This is also the last line of the play. For given that the central character is Sigmund Freud, you would expect a certain synthesis, synthetic or otherwise. In the meantime we have been on a rare helter-skelter that opens like a mystery-thriller, moves quickly into farce, then has long periods of semi-seriousness. Enjoyment of Terry Johnson's Hysteria will depend almost entirely on your mood on the night. Having returned from duty at the Edinburgh festival, I was looking for fun and a touch of southern frivolity, and very good some of it turns out to be. It is pleasing to hear that Freud had recently been to see Rookery Nook in the West End and had laughed four or five times. Since laughter for Freud was clearly a serious matter, that is a lot. I also enjoyed seeing Johnson emulate some of the best of the farce tradition: a naked girl, the daughter of the subject of one of Freud's case studies, hidden in the closet, and Salvador Dali, wonderfully played by Tim Potter, prancing about in his underclothes. The inevitable line takes a long time to come, but is worth waiting for. Old and doddery in London in 1939, Freud trips over the carpet. 'It was only a Freudian slip,' is the natural response. It is a pleasure, too, to find the Royal Court taking such an eclectic approach to its choice of plays. This is partly the same team that gave us John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation in this theatre: Phyllida Lloyd as director and Mark Thompson as an excellent designer of sets. Others, however, may prefer the more serious parts which centre on Freud as analyst and theorist and possibly Freud as a fraud. It is alleged that he changed his views when he saw how oddly they fitted with his own family background. I am unable to comment on how far that is true. The central theme that Freud and Dali were both frauds, though of a different kind, seems slightly implausible. Freud at least had a degree of seriousness which has passed into almost everyone's consciousness. Still, the equation between the two is something that theatre audiences in the right mood might like to discuss afterwards. There is also a Jewish doctor who goes on about Freud and Jewishness and a thesis that Moses was an Egyptian which, the doctor says, ought not to be published in the late 1930s. Some people might like to take that as a serious theme as well. For my part, I preferred the funny bits. Henry Goodman is a compelling Freud, but the mix is not quite right.

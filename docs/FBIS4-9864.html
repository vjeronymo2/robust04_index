			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 28 Mar (PL) -- The Foreign Ministry  confirmed today that the Cuban Government will invite  representatives from a broad political spectrum of Cuban  immigrant communities abroad to "The Nation and the Immigrant  Community Conference" to be held in late April.    People associated with different organizations and various  political persuasions will attend, said Rene Mujica, an adviser  to Foreign Relations Minister Roberto Robaina.    During an interview on Radio Rebelde, Mujica explained that  approximately 200 persons will receive personal invitations and  that representatives of anti-Cuban terrorist groups -- which are  mainly based in the United States -- will be excluded.    This meeting, scheduled for 22-24 April, was announced by  Foreign Minister Robaina on 14 February.    Robaina explained that one of the conference's goals is "to  examine measures that could be adopted to normalize the  immigrants' ties to their homeland."    Mujica says this is not seen as a short-term issue, since  most of the immigrants' ties with their homeland have developed  within the framework of 35 years of [word indistinct] by the  United States against the Cuban revolution.    Considering these antecedents, one can understand that the  goal of normalizing the immigrants' relations with their  homeland will not be easy, Mujica said.    However, he added, we believe this is a legitimate objective  that benefits all parties involved and injures no one, and it  can be achieved if both we and the immigrants have the will to  work towards its realization.    The official did not rule out finding a way to achieve this  goal with former counterrevolutionaries who have changed their  attitude, but he made clear that this objective can never be  achieved with those who persist with an antinational attitude.  There is no place here for the counterrevolution, Mujica  stressed.    It was recalled that the first meeting between local  authorities and immigrants took place in late 1978, but  afterward, the aggressive policy toward Cuba of the Ronald  Reagan and George Bush administrations deftly constrained the  development of these ties.</p>

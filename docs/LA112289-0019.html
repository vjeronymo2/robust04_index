			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> ROYAL MEETS MATCH IN STATE VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> Supporters of the Royal High girls' volleyball team packed the Highlander gym  Tuesday night to see if the team could write another chapter to its fairy tale  season in the first round of the state Division I playoffs.  </P> <P> But the Highlanders, who went from being unranked to Southern Section 4-A  Division champions, ended the year by dropping a 15-8, 15-13, 15-8 decision to  Torrey Pines at Royal High.  </P> <P> "We did what no one thought we could," Royal outside hitter Stephanie Champ  said, reflecting on the season. "We knew we could and (we) showed everybody."  </P> <P> Except Torrey Pines. The Highlanders (18-2), who relied on defense all season,  finally found a team that played that part of the game a little better.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines (23-3), in the state tournament for the sixth time in the past  nine years, allowed Royal only one sustained rally in the match.  </P> <P> "They were picking up balls off the floor," Royal Coach Bob Ferguson said.  "That's frustrating."  </P> <P> Royal, making its first appearance in the state tournament, trailed, 5-0, in  the second game before scoring 11 of the next 14 points. Three of those points  came on kills by Jennifer Hamilton, helping Royal to an 11-8 lead.  </P> <P> But after Torrey Pines scored the next five points, a kill by Champ and Beth  Kohs' service ace pulled Royal to within 14-13. But that was as close as the  Highlanders got.  </P> <P> Royal fell behind, 13-3, in the third game before rallying with five  consecutive points.  </P> <P> Two Torrey Pines points later, however, a 15-game Royal winning streak and  memorable season ended with a standing ovation from the Highlander faithful.  </P> <P> Afterward, the team tried to put it all in perspective.  </P> <P> "We never wanted to lose because we were having so much fun," outside hitter  Kohs said. "But we're happy to get as far as we got."  </P> <P> Hamilton led Royal with eight kills and six blocks. Wende Brown and Alison  Bantel each had six kills.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines was led by Jennifer Merideth with 15 kills.  </P></p>

Yesterday morning,  Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee and  president of the state, visited the Science Town market in  Haidian district, the Haizhong farm trade market, and the  Wangfujing department store to acquaint himself with the state  of market supplies and commodity prices prior to the Spring  Festival. Jiang Zemin said: Fuel, rice, cooking oil, salt, soy  sauce, vinegar, and tea are the seven daily necessities for  people. A small "shopping basket" affects thousands of  households, as well as social stability. Neither reform nor  development can be separated from stability. All matters that  affect people's basic lives and vital interests are of prime  importance. Party committees and governments at all levels, as  well as all work departments, must place these matters at the  top of their agendas and devote great efforts and close  attention to solving them with a deep sense of responsibility.  No oversight or negligence of duty is permitted in handling  such matters.    Comrade Jiang Zemin; Chen Xitong, member of the CPC Central  Committee Political Bureau and secretary of the Beijing  Municipal Party Committee; and Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan arrived in  the Science Town non-staple food market in a minibus before 0900  [0100 GMT]. Located in Zhongguan village, the market primarily  supplies and serves district residents from the Chinese Academy  of Sciences and institutions of higher learning. Walking  alongside shoppers, Jiang Zemin made inquiries to find out about  commodity supplies, prices, varieties, and sales. He  solicitously inquired about meat prices at the meat products  counter. After finding out the prices of various meat products,  he still showed some concern and asked: Were the prices lowered  because of our visit today? The shop assistant told Jiang  Zemin: We have used the same sales prices in recent days. At  the general merchandise counter, Jiang Zemin made detailed  inquiries about the shop assistant's working and living  conditions, and the shop's business hours. He said: Workers  and staff members at institutions of higher learning are busy in  the daytime; we must ensure that they can buy food after work.  At the entrance to a shop, Jiang Zemin shook hands with the  shop's responsible individual and advised the latter: You must  provide a good service to intellectuals and customers.    After leaving the Science Town market, Jiang Zemin went to  the nearby Haizhong farm trade market. The owners of more than  400 individual stalls in the building came from Shandong, Anhui,  Henan, Hebei, and other provinces. These self-employed business  operators from the countryside were pleasantly surprised by the  general secretary's arrival at their counters. At a vegetable  stall, Jiang Zemin asked about the prices of ginger, eggplant,  French beans, chilis, and other vegetables and was advised of  the stall's daily income. The owner, Zhao Xingfan, is a peasant  from Baoding, Hebei Province. After finding out, to her  surprise, that the customer who was making inquiries was the  general secretary, the sincere and honest village woman said  excitedly: General Secretary, it was very nice of you to have  taken the trouble to come here. As he walked from one counter  to another and proceeded from the first floor to the second,  Jiang Zemin was greatly delighted by the brisk business and the  wide selection of agricultural and sideline products at the  market. At a meat counter Jiang Zemin specifically asked the  owner whether the meats had been quarantined. He said  emphatically: We must implement a strict quarantine system for  all foods because consumers' health and safety are at stake. At  another counter, Jiang Zemin struck up a conversation with a  customer who was buying goods there. The customer was a female  teacher from the No. 3 Zhongguan village primary school. Jiang  Zemin asked: Is it convenient to buy goods here? After  receiving a positive reply, he nodded in contentment and told  the leading Beijing municipal comrades around him: Brisk  business at country markets has enriched urban and rural  markets; this is very important. Meanwhile, we must run  state-owned shops efficiently and let them truly play their role  in bringing prices under control, stabilizing the market, and  ensuring supplies.    At approximately 1000 [0200 GMT], Jiang Zemin arrived at  the Wangfujing department store in downtown Beijing. Offering a  wide array of goods, the department store was crowded with  customers prior to the holidays. When he saw some high-class  and brand-name garments in the clothing section, Jiang Zemin  asked a shop assistant: Do the garments sell well? The shop  assistant replied: More and more people are buying high-class  commodities because their living standards have improved. In  the footwear and headgear section, Jiang Zemin struck up a  cordial conversation with a young couple from the Huabei  oilfield and asked them if they could afford the prices. Upon  learning they were newlyweds, Jiang Zemin joyously congratulated  them.    Shortly afterward, Jiang Zemin held informal discussions on  market prices and supplies with responsible individuals and shop  assistants from the Department Store (Group) Limited Company,  shop assistants from the Xidan market and Chongwenmen vegetable  market, comrades from the Andeli Neighborhood Committee in  Dongcheng district and the Fengsheng Neighborhood Committee in  Xicheng district, and price supervisors from Beijing  Municipality, in order to directly hear their opinions.  Participants in the discussions said: Fifteen years of reform  and opening up have brought about very brisk commodity markets;  people no longer have to worry about rationed supplies. On the  other hand, commodity prices have undergone some changes during  the process of socialist market economic development. The broad  masses of people understand this situation. Recent substantial  increases in grain and cooking oil prices, however, have indeed  affected people's lives, especially the lives of retired workers  and staff members.    After hearing their remarks, Jiang Zemin said: An ancient  Chinese saying goes: "Food is the people's primary concern."  We should never underestimate the importance of residents'  "shopping baskets" because they have a direct bearing on overall  economic and social stability. The goal of our party and  government is to serve the people. Therefore, our leading  organs at all levels and the broad masses of cadres must always  show concern for the people's livelihood, serve the people's  interests in real earnest, conscientiously eliminate  inconveniences and difficulties for the people, and provide them  with adequate supplies.    Jiang Zemin pointed out: Properly handling price-related  work is of paramount importance. This is the general principle:  We should always maintain commodity prices at levels that are  affordable to urban and rural residents, as well as to people  throughout society. This will help improve people's lives and  benefit economic development and social stability. He said:  Consumers in some areas scrambled to buy grain, cooking oil,  and home electrical appliances for a time after late November in  1993. This was not caused by inadequate supplies or an  imbalance between supply and demand; rather, it mainly resulted  from a lack of experience in effectively regulating and  controlling prices after grain and cooking oil prices were  freed, and from price rises introduced by people who were  seeking their own individual interests. Moreover, we did not  sufficiently understand some reform measures that had been put  into effect. The party Central Committee and the State Council  placed great importance on this problem and promptly introduced  many measures to stabilize the market, bring prices under  control, and tighten regulation and control. The market is now  moving toward a stable state and has essentially resumed normal  operations.    In his remarks, Jiang Zemin fully affirmed the work carried  out by neighborhood committees and stated: Neighborhood  committees are important bridges that bring the government and  people closer together. They can help the party and government  solve many problems and difficulties encountered by residents,  defuse many contradictions among the people, and play a  tremendous role in enhancing people's unity and promoting social  stability. These vividly epitomize the superiority of the  socialist system. In keeping with the new situation, we must  greatly strengthen the work carried out by neighborhood  committees; we should by no means weaken it.    To ensure market supplies, Jiang Zemin urged leading cadres  at all levels to go down to the grass roots and continue to  devote great efforts to the "shopping basket" project.  Departments in charge of industry and commerce, commodity  prices, technical supervision, and market administration at all  levels should strengthen management; sternly deal with and  punish people who commit such illegal acts as seizing the  opportunity to drive up prices, disrupting market order, selling  fake and inferior products, seeking huge profits illegally, and  entrapping people; and achieve better results in stabilizing the  market. He said: The Spring Festival is approaching. All  localities and departments must take practical and effective  measures to take care of people, especially those in  poverty-stricken areas, and make proper arrangements for  supplies during the holidays so that people across the country  will joyously celebrate the traditional festival.    In closing, Jiang Zemin expressed his thanks for and  conveyed  his greetings on behalf of the party Central Committee and the  State Council to workers and staff members who were working hard  on the commercial and trade front.    Accompanying Comrade Jiang Zemin during his investigations  and studies were Zeng Peiyan, vice minister of the State  Planning Commission, and Hu Guangbao, deputy director of the CPC  Central Committee General Office.</p>

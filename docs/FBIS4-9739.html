			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "NTC News" newscast] </F>   [Text] A new guerrilla group has begun to operate in  Colombia. It calls itself Total Democracy [Democracia Total] or  Radical Democracy [Democracia Radical]. According to the DAS  [Administrative Department of Security] Intelligence Department,  the organization is made up of former members from the M-19 [19  April Movement] and Faith, Peace, and Freedom [EPL] who are  dissidents from the peace process.    The new organization's military targets are the presidential  candidates, congress members, bankers, industrialists, and their  former comrades, whom they accuse of treason. The director of  the DAS Intelligence Department pointed out that documents found  during an operation carried out by the DAS anti-kidnapping group  disclosed that the guerrillas were planning multiple attacks to  announce their subversive organization.    [Begin DAS Intelligence Director Ricardo Villarraga Franco  recording] They think the subversive struggle should be  transferred to the cities; that their support in the rural areas  is not as large as they would like. They want to carry out  selective attacks, as they themselves say, against the  bourgeoisie in the country. [end recording]    Villarraga Franco insists this new guerrilla organization  has  recruited at least 20 percent of the former fighters of the four  subversive organizations that demobilized. In addition, he said  they are opposed to the tactics used by the National Guerrilla  Coordinating Board.    The main topic of the most recent Security Council held at  the Defense Ministry was the appearance of Total Democracy. The  authorities feel this group cannot be underestimated, because it  has grown in strength and military capability.</p>

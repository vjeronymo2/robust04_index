			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 31 KYODO -- The 1994 white paper on the  environment approved by the cabinet Tuesday [31 May] endorses  the introduction of "environment taxes" to transform Japan's  throwaway society into an economy "less burdensome to the  environment."    Prices should reflect the detrimental effects of production  processes, products, and services on the environment, while  investment in environment-friendly "green" businesses must be  promoted, the Environment Agency's paper suggests.    For a successful turnaround of the economic system both,  producers and consumers have to be involved, it said.    Consumers must be educated about an ecological lifestyle  that  breaks with the entrenched habits of unrestrained consumerism.    The corporate world, too, must be made aware of the business  opportunities environment technology and eco-oriented industries  offer as environmental awareness heightens, the paper said.    Despite technological progress that has helped to curb  machine energy consumption, each Japanese consumes more than  double the world average in primary energy.    This is due to large-scale consumption and the never-ending  quest for a higher and "bigger" living standard, according to  the paper.    Consumers could play an important role in the ecological  transformation by making choices and buying green products,  which would eventually force producers to develop more  environment-friendly products.    The paper does not trust the market forces alone and  recommends introducing taxes that take into account  environmental costs and to impose charges on ecologically  harmful products and activities to foster the ecological  transformation.    An environmental tax such as a levy on carbon dioxide  emissions was under discussion last year, but the basic  environment law, adopted last November, simply urges the  government to consider imposing a tax on polluters.    The white paper also advocates further expanding deposit  systems for bottles and other reusable containers.    It claims that industrial production could be even extended  in the latter part of the 21st century without further  destroying the environment, if investment over the next 50 years  focuses on antipollution measures and the saving of scarce  resources.    Sewage facilities and other investments in environmental  protection would also pay off by stimulating the slumping  economy, the paper says.    For an effective ecological overhaul of the economic system,  which should be laid out in the nation's basic environment  program currently being worked out, the government should  consult with industry, civic groups and municipal bodies, the  paper suggests.</p>

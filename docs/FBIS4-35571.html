			<p>BFN     [Text] The organization Peace Watch claims that Israel has  violated the autonomy agreement signed in Cairo by limiting the  entry of agricultural products from Gaza into Israel. The  independent watch-dog group said the eighth paragraph in the  fourth appendix calls for free passage to markets.    Israel has limited the entrance of agricultural products  from  the autonomous area until proper compensation is arranged for  Israeli producers and until quality control for agricultural  products and livestock are ensured. A joint Israeli-Palestinian  committee has been set up to deal with the matter.</p>

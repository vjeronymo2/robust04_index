The church was packed with worshippers.    Father Antoine Sfayr, who was leading the service, was among  55 people wounded in the explosion, which rocked the church as  he began reading from the scriptures.    U.S. President Bill Clinton, Jordan's King Husayn and Pope  John Paul II joined in condemnation of the attack.    There was no claim of responsibility but an unidentified  suspect was arrested, prosecutor Tarabayh Rahmah announced late  Sunday after an emergency meeting of security officials which  included Syrian officers.    The authorities were aware of "a plan to commit attacks in  places of worship in Lebanon," Rahmah said, noting that the  suspect was arrested a few days before the blast.    Lebanese newspapers, echoing officials here and in Syria,  pointed an accusing finger at Israel and linked the attack to  the massacre Friday of 52 Palestinians in a mosque in Hebron on  the occupied West Bank.

			<p>940511 FT  11 MAY 94 / Government Bonds: Overseas buying helps US Treasuries rebound US Treasury prices yesterday staged an impressive rally from Monday's losses, aided by overseas buying, dealer short-covering and a successful three-year note auction. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 17/32 at 85 7/32 , yielding 7.497 per cent. Prices were also markedly firmer at the short end of the market, where the two-year note was up  7/32 at 98 27/32 , to yield 6.114 per cent. The bond market got off to a positive start yesterday due to strong overnight buying of Treasuries by Japanese and Middle Eastern investors. That demand quickly triggered buying in New York, which forced many dealers hurriedly to buy securities to cover their short positions. Later in the day, prices jumped further after the auction of Dollars 17bn in three-year notes met heavy demand - much of it, it was said, from foreign investors. The successful three-year sale raised hopes that today's auction of Dollars 12bn in 10-year notes would also pass well. In spite of the gains, however, analysts said that the mood of the market remained restrained in the wake of the Federal Reserve's decision not to raise interest rates on Monday. Investors and traders had been hoping that the Fed would tighten monetary policy to slow the economy and stifle inflation. It is now thought likely that the Fed will not make a move until the May 17 meeting of its policy-making open market committee. European government bond markets temporarily recovered their composure, closing higher as the Bundesbank's decision to cut its closely-watched repo rate yesterday raised market hopes of a further cut in the key discount rate at today's Bundesbank council meeting. The securities repurchase, or repo, rate fell from 5.41 per cent to 5.35 per cent, with the Bundesbank adding a net DM1.1bn in liquidity, and narrowing the gap between the repo and the discount rate, which effectively provides the floor for money market rates. The move, which was within the market's expected range, prompted speculation that the Bundesbank will cut its discount rate by 25 basis points today to 4.75 per cent, and that the Bank of France will have room to ease again, possibly at next Monday's repo. The European markets have been jittery since Friday, when the release of the latest US payroll data sparked fears of an imminent rise in short-term US interest rates. 'There is mounting speculation that we could see the Federal Reserve raise rates on Wednesday while the Bundesbank could cut rates,' said Mr Kit Juckes, economist at S. G. Warburg Securities. Adding to the optimistic mood in the bund market was the fact that April inflation was revised downwards from 3.2 per cent year-on-year to 3.1 per cent. Meanwhile, news that the German March M3 figure was revised upwards to 15.4 per cent, from a preliminary figure of 15.2 per cent, was largely ignored by the market. Dealers commented that there was very little cash business, with most of the activity taking place in the futures market. The bund futures contract opened at 94.27 and slipped back to a low of 94.25 soon afterwards, but then picked up and recovered to reach 95.10 by late afternoon. UK government bonds gained  3/8 points despite a volatile session, but the most important news came after the gilt market had closed, when the Bank of England released its quarterly bulletin and inflation report. The Bank revised upwards its inflation forecast for 1995, citing higher monetary growth and rising labour market costs. However, dealers said the gilt futures contract climbed a quarter point from 103.15 to 103.23 in after-hours trading as participants chose to focus on the relatively favourable short-term inflation outlook. Japanese government bond prices closed higher, driven up by modest domestic buying and helped by the Bank of Japan's decision to inject liquidity at its money market operations.</p>

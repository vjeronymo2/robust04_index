			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 29 (XINHUA)--The Shanghai municipal  government plans to enact 22 sets of regulations this year in a  move to step up urban construction and facilitate the creation  of a market economy.    A municipal government official said that ten sets of  regulations will deal with economic and urban construction.    There will be a set of regulations concerning the management  of technology markets, another set on the supervision of product  quality, another set concerning environmental protection and  still another regarding the protection of consumers' rights and  interests.    The official said that six sets of regulations will govern  social management and the protection of rights and interests of  local citizens.    Another three sets will deal with culture and education, he  added.    The municipal government is drawing up a plan for the  formulation of local regulations over the next few years, with  emphasis placed on economic, urban and social management, he  said.    A series of new regulations will be formulated to speed up  the establishment of a market economic structure in Shanghai, he  said.    The municipal government has decided to issue a set of  regulations regarding the establishment of a modern enterprise  system; another set concerning the management and operation of  state-owned assets; another set governing the building of  commodity markets and production factory markets; another set on  the maintenance of the market order; another set related to the  establishment of a rational personal income distribution system;  and still another set on the establishment of a social security  system.    Over the past nine years, the municipal government has  issued  370 sets of regulations in an effort to ensure the  implementation of the policies on reforms and opening up, the  official said.    Fourteen sets of regulations concerning the Pudong new area  in Shanghai have been enacted, he said.    These regulations permit foreign businesses to open  department stores, supermarkets, banks, financial firms and  insurance companies in the Pudong area, where flexible policies  are being pursued to encourage Chinese and foreign investors.    Of the 370 sets of regulations, 60 percent deal with  economic  affairs, with stress placed on standardizing economic activities  and tightening government control.</p>

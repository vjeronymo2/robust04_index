			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Observer: Shorthand Fresh evidence of Richard Branson's highly individualistic business approach emerged at yesterday's press conference on his new national pop radio station. As the man who humiliated mighty British Airways explained his plans to beat the BBC at the pop radio game, a colleague's attention was caught by a message inked on Branson's hand. A reminder to call Lord King perhaps, or Transport Secretary John MacGregor? Something much more important, it seems. A reminder to call Roger Bray, the Evening Standard's air correspondent and travel writer. And no, Branson was not returning Bray's call. The prolific communicator just wanted to bend the hack's ear about his latest mission - capturing some of BA's airport slots.</p>

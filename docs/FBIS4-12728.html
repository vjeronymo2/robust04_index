			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Yosi Walter] </F>   [Text] The fear sneaks in at the border crossing near  Misgav 'Am. A kind of a chill that creeps to the chest and  settles in the lower part of the stomach. The feeling has many  names, which change shape in one's inflamed imagination:  Hizballah, Sagger missiles, road-side charges, and car bombs.    A look at the faces of IDF [Israel Defense Forces] soldiers  preparing to enter the security zone in southern Lebanon reveals  that I am not alone in this. They, too, are nervous, they too  are tense. The troops have been long waiting for an axis to  open; their entry is made impossible by the heavy fog in the  area. And the fog and dark are the best friends of the enemy,  of Hizballah.    This name will accompany us during the long hours we will  spend with IDF troops. Everyone knows what this fanatic  organization is capable of. Moreover, it has been dictating new  rules of the game in recent months, and a new term has entered  the terror vocabulary of south Lebanon. They call it  "counterfire." They attack IDF targets, mainly convoys, from a  distance. This time they use Sagger missiles. That way the  terrorists avoid direct contact with our troops while reaching  the same, or even better, results. The counterfire has already  claimed victims. And Hizballah's precision firing is improving  as time goes on.    The force is preparing to enter. The objective is an IDF  outpost near a Shiite village, and the question whether its  residents are sympathetic to Israel sounds very irrelevant in  this context. In the background, we listen to a transistor  radio where Qol Yisra'el reports at length on yesterday's  incident in which two IDF soldiers were killed a few kilometers  east of the outpost as the crow flies. We enter the danger zone,  and in the danger zone, everything changes: behavior, thinking,  and talk.    An interim balance of terrorist activities in south Lebanon  since the beginning of March: five instances of gunfire at IDF  and SLA [South Lebanese Army] outposts; the discovery of six  powerful explosive devices; an attack on an SLA unit, in which  two terrorists were killed, one was wounded, and one was taken  captive; an attack on civilian vehicles, in which four Lebanese  civilians were killed, an SLA soldiers was killed, and another  soldier was kidnaped; gunfire at an IDF convoy, no casualties;  the killing of three terrorists on their way to an attack and  hostage taking in Israel; and the last two incidents -- a  powerful explosive device which killed two IDF soldiers and  katyushas at western Galilee.    Brigadier General G., the sector commander, has lived with  this data for many years. As an officer and a fighter who has  accumulated thousands of Lebanon hours in various capacities in  the area, he dismisses the matter as "that's life." And if  there was no security zone, all this fire would have descended  on the Galilee. The security zone is not the objective, it is a  means for protecting the home front. For him, this means one  thing: The Lebanon War is not over, it simply goes on in  different ways everyday, every hour. And even though the events  have diverted the limelights to Judaea, Samaria, and Gaza, to  the Cave of the Patriarchs and Qiryat Arba', Lebanon has  remained the same Lebanon, and a war is under way in the  security zone in which IDF troops confront a determined,  ruthless, fanatical, and uncompromising enemy whose methods are  becoming increasingly more sophisticated, and as much as we  dislike the thought, whose performance has been improving as  well.    The fog disperses, and the soldiers are still there,  bundled in their flak jackets, their helmets pushed low on their  heads, their guns loaded, and their senses keen. After  receiving brief instructions, they start moving. A finger on  the trigger, eyes scanning each crevice, each wadi, each  roadside stone.    G., the sector intelligence officer, is familiar with each  curve and stone. Each place has its own story. Here, he says,  is where an Islamic Jihad squad fired at a unit which was moving  on the axis. Five soldiers were wounded. The Beaufort looms in  the background. As in the past, it is still the source of  serious trouble. Not long ago, terrorists fired Sagger missiles  at an IDF convoy. Fortunately, they missed. And there have been  infiltration attempts. This sector abuts on Misgav 'Am and  Margaliyyot, both of which had been marked by terrorists as  favorite targets. Since Operation Accountability, however, the  terrorists moved their operations into the security zone.    The operation generated an odd understanding between Israel  and Hizballah, namely that they can play with fire only inside  the security zone. And that zone is Hizballah's home field.  Hizballah personnel are intimately acquainted with the terrain,  they enjoy the support of large sectors of the Lebanese  population. They get their weapons and money from Iran, and  they have learned how to work, too: They gather intelligence,  keep observation posts, acquire experience in routine tasks, and  hit where it hurts. The peace process and the new reality of  the recent months have created a convenient ground for  Hizballah's operations in that south Lebanon residents have  become uncertain whether Israel would withdraw in the wake of  the peace agreement.    The resident's confusion grew in the wake of the  understanding between Israel and Syria and Hizballah at the  conclusion of Operation Accountability. They felt that by  tolerating terrorist activities in the security zone -- provided  Hizballah refrain from attacking Israel's north -- Israel was  disowning them. Because of this, cracks opened in Israel's hold  on the local population.    The cracks have been filled by Hizballah. It has commands in  villages, its fighters blend in with the population, and it uses  these villages as launching pads for its operations. The  availability of Saggers permits them long-distance operations.  They concentrate in villages beyond the security zone, in an  area which has been termed "the gray zone." From there, they  fire and launch attacks on SLA outposts.    They direct their activities mainly against the SLA,  attacking and trying to take outposts, firing at convoys,  killing, and kidnapping. Population centers -- mainly Christian  -- are another target for the terrorists' katyushas, mortars,  and Saggers.    Hizballah makes an effort to abide by its understandings  with  Israel. Brig. Gen. G. says that when katyushas landed in the  Galilee Panhandle about a month ago, the organization took the  trouble to convey a message to the IDF that it had had no part  in the event.    Yet their activity against Israel has been replaced by  attacks in south Lebanon, which are dealt with a vengeance.    Brig. Gen. G. arrives at an IDF outpost to speak to  soldiers and officers of a Golani Brigade company. In fact, he  is here to check whether the soldiers are prepared for the  activities awaiting them, are aware of their importance, and  have adopted all the measures to protect themselves. "As you  march forward," Brig. Gen. G. tells them, "look back at Misgav  'Am and Margaliyot, and you will understand what you are  defending."    These guys, however, need no instigation. They truly believe  they are doing an important job. They have been in Lebanon  before and have paid a heavy price. Seven of their colleagues  were killed in a clash with terrorists a few months ago. The  image of their dead friends haunt all of them whenever they go  out on an operation. They know Hizballah well. Sergeant Menashe  Rajwan, a veteran fighter, knows that they attack at dawn. To  avoid surprises he wakens his soldiers early in the morning and  urges them to take positions "so they are not caught with their  pants down."    Activities in the outpost include patrols, lookouts, and  other initiated operations that cannot be detailed. The young  soldiers proudly bear this heavy load. According to them, their  activities are not meant to totally prevent terrorist attacks,  since absolute success does not exist, but their presence is  definitely a deterrent.    "Every time we go out on patrol," says Menashe, "we look for  mines, explosive charges, and terrorists about to attack us.  Many dangers loom here. The bombs they plant can blow you to  pieces."    Menashe, just like the rest of his colleagues, treats  Hizballah with respect. As far as he is concerned, Hizballah is  not just a gang of terrorists but a real army, well-trained and  organized. "I fight soldiers, although it is easier to define  them as terrorists. My mother thinks I fight kaffiyeh-clad men  who shout Allahu Akbar [Allah Is Great]. That is not correct,  they are soldiers. And it is my duty as a soldier to kill any  soldier or terrorist who is my enemy," Menashe asserts.    A sign hangs in the room of the company commander,  Lieutenant  Ofeq Bukharis: "The Goal -- Security to the Northern  Settlements." So that these settlements may enjoy security, says  G., we must live here with insecurity and cope with a long  series of threats. Ofeq has such a list, a list of terror.  However, he trusts his soldiers and the IDF's firepower. As  far as he is concerned, the terrorists are a threat that must be  tackled but they do not threaten Israel's physical existence  and, consequently, there is no sense in getting all worked up  about them. "The sacrifice we made, seven of our  soldiers-friends killed, is a pain we carry in our hearts. It  follows us everywhere. However, it does not discourage the guys  who do their work well and professionally."    We asked Ofeq whether he agrees with the chief of staff, who  described the situation in south Lebanon as a war. Ofeq is used  to being asked this question, and he promptly shoots back an  answer: "In Lebanon, everything is quiet until something  happens. It is a miniature war, a local war. When something  happens there is a big to-do, but when it is all over calm  prevails again." Nevertheless, Ofeq also knows that this calm  is illusionary and that events in the field get the soldiers'  adrenaline racing.    The talk stops abruptly when Ofeq is urgently summoned to  the war room. Katyushas have just landed in the western  Galilee. The company goes into high alert, and everybody takes  positions. Radios click away. The sound of rifles being bolted  can be heard in the lookout positions. Small talk and joking  stop at once. Everybody tenses up. Menashe Rajwan tells us: "We  are Israel's feet. Without the IDF in the security zone, Israel  could not walk. The northern settlements would not live in peace  and everybody's life would be disrupted. Although soldiers get  killed, the bottom line is there have been no infiltrations into  our territory for a long time and I know that I am doing an  important job."    [Walter] "Did the loss of seven colleagues not affect the  performance of the soldiers?"    [Rajwan] "We have all changed our perception since then.  Guys who once itched to encounter terrorists no longer want it.  They say they are afraid of losing friends. They do not fear  what will happen to them. After all, everybody feel immortal.  What they fear is what will happen to their friends, that they  might lose them."    Activity in the outpost returns to normal after it turns out  that the katyushas caused no damage. The guys persistently  continue to ask when the supply convoy is due to arrive. All  staples were removed from the kitchen in anticipation of  Passover, and they are now waiting for kosher food. Meanwhile,  G. gathers the soldiers and asks them to offer suggestions on  what needs improvement. Reservists join the meeting. Most of  them are married and have children and, as a result, fear plays  a bigger role with them. They are afraid of mortar shells and  katyushas falling on their living quarters and ask for  additional protection.    The greatest fear is posed by the Sagger missiles. "We heard  on the radio that two soldiers were killed, and that is  frightening," Norberto Gruenstadt, a mechanical engineer from  Karmi'el tells me. "It is scarier here at night. We are scared  to go out, we are scared of Saggers and katyushas. The  terrorists have learned to use Saggers, and they are extremely  accurate. They see a light, aim, and shoot. What can we do?  We dim the lights. We are careful and watch our step. Beyond  that, we can only hope they will miss. To me, this is a new  feeling. I have served in the territories so far, and the  feeling there is different. However tough it may get, you are  in control. Here, you just sit and wait."    Roni Merom from Haifa describes days of fear, as he puts it.  He is mainly talking about rainy days, when everything is dark  and the clouds seem to hang over one's head. "Vision is  limited, you sit with a magazine in the barrel of your rifle and  feel scared. On the other hand, I know that if there is an  attack people will act properly. Although there is that  certainty, you do not forget for a moment that you are in  Lebanon, and Lebanon is not Gaza."    Meanwhile, the supply convoy arrives. At long last they  will be able to get a hot meal. More than satisfying the  immediate need to quash their hunger, the convoy brings the  soldiers smells from home. They will most probably spend the  Passover dinner in this outpost, and the sweet wine somehow  brings their homes here. Amir Nisan from Petah Tiqva constantly  thinks about home and about ways to calm his worried parents.  Whenever an incident is reported on the radio, he rushes to  phone home to assure his parents that he is all right. The  families, he says, pay the highest price. They are consumed by  worry. Many soldiers here cannot phone home, which kills their  parents. I know guys who do not tell their parents where they  are stationed. They say they are somewhere in Israel, and on  their way home on leave they hide their flak jackets and steel  helmets so that mom and dad will not find out their secret.    Things look different from there. When you are part of it,  the business somehow looks less awful. The danger exists, but  it is not all that tangible. The surrounding quiet gives you an  artificial sense of security, and the knots you felt in your  stomach on the way here gradually disappear. Something in this  outpost and in the SLA outposts along the front lines gives you  the feeling that the terrorists will not fail to penetrate this  defense line.    However, the reality is that the SLA soldiers are the first  to be hit by the fire. The guys call them the IDF's flak  jacket. Indeed, the SLA is nothing more than a flak jacket. It  can curb, but it cannot prevent attacks. Moreover, the guys  know that the SLA was conceived as a necessary evil. Lebanese  men join its ranks because it is clear to them that if they do  not keep the terrorists away their lives will become  intolerable. IDF commanders praise them, say that they do a  good job. Nevertheless, they are just a flak jacket, not the  chief weapon. The main factor is the IDF, which shoulders most  of the responsibility. Without the IDF's backing, the SLA would  not survive.    First Lieutenant Sha'ul, commander of a tank company, tells  us the story of how he rushed to help SLA troops in the  Shomriyot [placename as published] area when they were attacked  by waves of Hizballah men. The SLA soldiers stood up to them  like men, but they still needed the IDF's help. Sha'ul arrived  and opened fire. Many terrorists were killed, and those who  were not hit escaped. "Only here you feel that you are  defending your country. When you see the lights of Misgav 'Am  at night, you sense how important it is."    Brig. Gen. G. again gathers the soldiers for a final talk.  He tells them about thousands of hikers who will be swarming  the north during the Passover holiday, as if they did not know.  "You are an excellent response to the threats," the senior  officer praises them and wishes them a happy holiday. Here and  now, in an outpost crisscrossed by communications canals,  overlooking the horizon beyond which the terrorists are hiding,  with the Beaufort Castle in the north and Misgav 'Am in the  back, his blessing sounds very significant.    Commander of the Northern Command:  <H5>  It Is A Fight, Not A War </H5>   Major General Yitzhaq Mordekhay, commander of the Northern  Command, rushed back and forth that day between the landing site  of the katyushas and the funeral of a soldier who was killed in  an incident in south Lebanon the previous day. The complexity  of the activities and the intensity of the events take up almost  his entire day. He works around the clock. Ever since he took  the job, about three years ago, he has only taken four days  leave. And even then he had no choice, he had to move to a new  house.    He describes the situation in Lebanon as a "fight," not a  war. A continuous fight that may never end. The IDF, he says,  operates in a harsh terrain opposite terrorist organizations  that will stop at nothing. This state of affairs gives the  terrorists an edge over a regular army. The IDF -- and this is  no secret -- has a hard time obtaining intelligence information  about these organizations, but nevertheless it manages to impair  and thwart a large part of their activities. This exacts its  toll in blood. The price is painful and steep, but this is a  reality that has been forced on us, Mordekhay says.    [Walter] "Do you hold Syria responsible for these  activities?"    [Mordekhay] "There is no doubt that if the Syrians so  wanted, they could significantly decrease the activities of  Hizballah and the rejectionist organizations. The fact is that  ever since the understandings attained in the wake of Operation  Accountability there have hardly been any katyusha attacks on  the Galilee."    Later in the evening, the general receives a report about an  incident in which two IDF soldiers were wounded, presumably by  our own soldiers. Units drill safety regulations every day but  accidents happen, which are apparently part of the price such  complex activities exact.    The general found some solace in a bar mitzvah party in  Qiryat Shemona. A boy whose father was killed by a katyusha  during Operation Accountability turned 13, and Gen. Mordekhay  organized a party for him. The boy's family is poor, and the  general took it under his wing. Although keeping in contact  with the northern settlements is part of his duties, Gen.  Mordekhay does not conceal the fact that this is one duty he  loves very much.</p>

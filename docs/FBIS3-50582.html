			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] According to official reports, 105 people have died  as a result of the riot in Sabaneta Prison, and approximately 60  more were injured; some of the injured have said that the  massacre was planned inside the prison.    Firemen are still in front of the prison caring for inmates  who jumped from the third floor of the prison to avoid a raging  fire and sustained broken bones. Some of them do not know how  the massacre started; others say that hooded individuals  initiated a war that culminated with the death of innocent  people. Apparently, the people involved in these incidents are  very dangerous.    [Begin recording] [Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Bocony, Zulia  State National Guard commander] We removed the bodies of 101  inmates and 49 injured people yesterday. Of the 49, two died  later. The official count so far is 103 dead. There are 15  inmates registered in various local hospitals right now.    [Judge Salvador Cubillan] This was the result of a vendetta  from inmates in the rehabilitation area of the prison against  inmates in another area.    [Unidentified reporter] Why a vendetta?    [Cubillan] For having banning visits Sunday, when shots were  fired; as a reprisal, these inmates tried this.    [Reporter] How many bodies have been identified?    [Cubillan] Approximately 60. [end recording]    Once informed of the tragedy, Justice Minister Fermin Marmol  Leon arrived in Maracaibo to meet with Governor Lolita Aniyar de  Castro and to inspect the prison. Marmol Leon said that in view  of this situation, security measures will be adopted. These  measures include the transfer of certain inmates to other prison  centers as well, and, most important, as thorough changes in the  prison directorship. [sentence as heard]    [Begin recording] [Marmol Leon] Perhaps our judicial  processes are too slow. I do not want to say that the Judicial  Branch is to blame for what has happened. I am going to present  to the new Congress a bill calling for reforms to the criminal  trials code so that this procedure can move faster. Perhaps  this will help those being tried.    [Aniyar de Castro] We are going to appoint a new team to  direct this prison and a new guard personnel. We have been in  contact with the Rafael Urdaneta Center, which is in charge of  building new prisons, so that it will build a prison as soon as  possible, perhaps before December, even if only half of the  cells are ready at that time, and we are going to use space  available in the National Prison, which was partially set on  fire, to take some preventive measures that will help until the  new prison begins functioning. [end recording]    Regarding this massacre in the National Prison of Sabaneta,  Maracaibo, it has been reported that the prison system director  will be arriving in Maracaibo within the next few hours to  initiate the transfer of the individuals responsible for this  accident, which has shocked both the national and international  public.</p>

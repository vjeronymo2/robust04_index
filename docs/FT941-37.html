			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Australian drinks group in Slovenia Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian-based soft drinks company controlled by Coca-Cola in the US, is acquiring a 75 per cent interest in the former state-owned enterprise which holds the Coca-Cola franchise in the Republic of Slovenia. The deal is worth about ADollars 10m (USDollars 7.1m). Coca-Cola said the business, which is being privatised, will manufacture and distribute Coca-Cola products through an existing bottling plant in Zalec, and a sales and distribution depot in Ljubliana. The remaining equity in the business will be held locally, essentially by employees. Coca-Cola Amatil already has franchises in surrounding countries, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech and Slovak republics and Belarus. Amcor, the Australian paper and packaging group which has been expanding aggressively into Europe and North America, yesterday announced plans to build an ADollars 18m flexible packaging plant in Beijing. The project is aimed mainly at servicing multinational customers with established operations in the region. The company said construction would start shortly, and that the plant was due to be operational by mid-1995.</p>

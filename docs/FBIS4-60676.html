			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Double-Talk Must Not Be Tolerated"] </F>   [Text] Not only did Yasir 'Arafat's Johannesburg mosque  speech call on the Muslims to come and wage jihad for the  liberation of Jerusalem; in that same speech, the full text of  which was disclosed only yesterday, he justified his signing of  the Oslo and Cairo agreements by citing Prophet Muhammad's act:  The latter signed an agreement with the Mecca tribe of  Quiraish, but violated it two years later. This historical  reference implies that the PLO leader reserves the right to  renege on his agreements with the State of Israel.    His attempt to justify his call for jihad for Jerusalem by  explaining that the term -- which has an undoubtedly military  connotation -- does not refer to bellicose activity but rather  to nonviolent struggle, was defined by the prime minister as  "far-fetched"; it would be equally accurate to describe Yitzhaq  Rabin's reaction this way. The PLO leader's reference to the  Muhammad example creates a crisis of confidence with 'Arafat.  What will Israel be able to rely on if the PLO leader,  addressing a Muslim audience, apologizes for agreements with  Israel while citing a precedent from the early days of Islam --  a precedent legitimizing the violation of agreements?    Israel can understand that 'Arafat must contend with the  problem of the Islamic fundamentalists' objection to recognizing  the Jewish state and the agreements, but it does not have to  tolerate his double-talk. If the PLO leader wants to promote  the peace process with Israel, he must retract the transparent  insinuation that he is not bound by the Oslo and Cairo  agreements and that he even sees himself free to violate them.  The Israeli Government cannot again settle for the kind of  mollifying explanations 'Arafat offered following his call for a  jihad for the liberation of Jerusalem. It is imperative that  'Arafat declare unequivocally that he acknowledges the validity  of all the agreements and that he will adhere to them, as he has  pledged to do.    Not only the Declaration of Principles [DOP] and the Cairo  agreement are at stake. 'Arafat should at last do what he  promised in a letter to the prime minister on 9 September 1993:  "The PLO considers that the signing of the DOP constitutes a  historic event, inaugurating a new epoch of peaceful  coexistence, free from violence and all other acts which  endanger peace and stability.... The PLO affirms that those  articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right  to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are  inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now  inoperative and no longer valid. Consequently, the PLO  undertakes to submit to the Palestinian National Council [PNC]  for formal approval the necessary changes in regard to the  Palestinian Covenant."    'Arafat has owed this approval to Israel for over eight  months. Another postponement must not be tolerated. If he wants  to establish self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho, he must  make a concentrated effort to secure the PNC's consent to the  approval to which Israel is entitled.    The PLO chief will do well not to delude himself about the  gravity of the impact of his Johannesburg remarks. If his  yearning for a conciliation with Hamas [Islamic Resistance  Movement] renders his consideration for the State of Israel a  marginal issue, he should know that the Gaza and Jericho peace  process will be frozen in its present condition, and there will  be no continuation of the interim and toward the permanent  settlements. Unless he sees to it that the clauses in the  covenant are revoked, he will be unable to regain Israel's trust  in the PLO's sincerity, and instead of settling in Jericho,  'Arafat will stay in Tunis.</p>

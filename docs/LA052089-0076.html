			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEARFUL BREZHNEV SHOOK IN OUSTING KHRUSHCHEV IN '64  </P> <P> Kremlin colleagues dragged a trembling Leonid I. Brezhnev to the telephone to  make the call which led to him to topple Nikita S. Khrushchev as Soviet leader  in 1964, according to a former KGB chief.  </P> <P> In an interview with the weekly Argumenti i Fakti published Friday Vladimir V.  Semichastny, who headed the KGB state security service from 1961 to 1967 gave  an intriguing insight into the coup that ousted Khrushchev, whose flamboyant  behavior and reform schemes met with mounting criticism within the leadership.  </P> <P> "While Khrushchev was away on holiday in October, all the members of the  Presidium (Politburo) of the (Communist Party) Central Committee got together  at the Brezhnevs' and it was decided to summon Khrushchev back from Pitsunda  (on the Black Sea coast) to Moscow," he said.  </P> <P> "We decided to telephone him. Who should do it? Brezhnev of course. It took us  great effort to persuade him. We dragged him, almost by force, to the  telephone."  </P> <P> "His voice trembling, Brezhnev told Khrushchev the Presidium would meet the  next day to discuss a range of questions concerning the seven-year plan."  </P> <P> Khrushchev was not told the true purpose of the meeting. The deception  continued until he was inside the Kremlin.  </P></p>

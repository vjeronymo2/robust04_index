			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Economy Ministry sources disclosed that the  government has not authorized the U.S. company American Airlines  to increase the frequency of its flights to and from Argentina  during the low season.    This refusal follows a similar one issued in November  against  a similar petition filed by American Airlines and United  Airlines and supported by U.S. Ambassador James Cheek.    American Airlines was informed of the refusal while the  economic team was holding meetings with Iberia officials to  negotiate the possibility of increasing Argentine Airlines'  capital.    An Economy Ministry official explained that the official  refusal of American Airlines' proposal was prompted by Argentine  Airlines' commitment to cover all the demand, which, according  to the U.S. company, exceeds 60 percent of the available seats.    This gesture indicates that the government is issuing  favorable signals to Argentine Airlines' operator.    The economic negotiation did not manage to find a solution  to  Iberia's petition to increase Argentine Airlines' capital. An  official source said: "If it is not demonstrated that the  company is economically viable, it is useless to make any  capital contributions."</p>

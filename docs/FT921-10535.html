			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: TWA prospects poor, says S&amp;P STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit ratings agency, yesterday estimated the chances of a successful reorganisation at Trans World Airlines to be 'even, at best', adding that it viewed the airline's long-term prospects as 'poor'. TWA filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code last Friday, and its owner, Mr Carl Icahn, has been reported as saying that the carrier has a '90-10 chance to make it'. However, some analysts have been more sceptical. S&amp;P has already attached 'D' ratings to the company's senior notes. In its analysis of the situation, S&amp;P pointed out that the filing fell short of a 'pre-packaged bankruptcy' - where a reorganisation scheme has already been agreed with all creditors and the bankruptcy mechanism is merely used to implement it. It suggests that the timing of the filing 'appears to be motivated by the conclusion of preliminary agreements with most creditors and a continuing cash drain that may necessitate debtor-in-possession financing to continue operations'. However, S&amp;P also noted the potential pension problem at TWA, and the fact that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation - a federal agency which essentially guarantees basic pension payments - has not agreed to the reorganisation as outlined. The PBGC has claimed that TWA's pension plans are underfunded by Dollars 933m, although this is subject to some dispute. At present, because of the level of Mr Icahn's ownership, a liquidation at TWA could allow the PBGC to seek recovery from other Icahn-controlled entities. However, if the reorganisation scheme reduced Mr Icahn's stake below 50 per cent - as envisaged - this access would disappear under US law.</p>

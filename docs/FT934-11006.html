			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Malaysia: furious growth continues: A look at the south-east Asian nation's optimistic outlook MALAYSIA'S economy continues to expand at rates western countries dream about. On Friday Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the finance minister, presented the 1994 budget and forecast that Malaysia's gross domestic product was likely to grow by 8.2 per cent this year. 'With this growth, the Malaysian economy would have experienced growth rates of 8 to 9 per cent for six successive years, an attainment which has never been achieved before,' said Mr Anwar. Officials say Malaysia is on course to achieve its aim of becoming a fully industrialised country by the year 2020. 'We are moving into a period of sustainable economic development,' said one official. 'To achieve our goal we aim for 7 per cent growth in each of the next 27 years.' While some might doubt that such high growth can be maintained, Malaysia is optimistic. The Kuala Lumpur stock market, which has risen more than 50 per cent since the beginning of the year, largely due to a massive influx of foreign funds, reached a new all-time high in the aftermath of Mr Anwar's budget speech. Despite a recession in many of its markets, Malaysia's export earnings are expected to grow by 16 per cent to MDollars 120bn (USDollars 47bn) this year, compared with a 10 per cent rise in 1992. While Malaysia still runs a substantial deficit in its services account, a strong export performance is expected to result in a surplus in the balance of payments current account, the first since 1989. Strong economic growth has brought an improvement in national finances. Foreign exchange reserves rose from MDollars 47.2bn at the end of 1992 to over MDollars 60bn and the country's debt service ratio has gone down to 5.2 per cent from 5.7 per cent of gross exports. Despite a rise of 13 per cent in development spending in the 1994 budget, the government says an increase in revenues due to strong economic growth means that Malaysia is expected to achieve a balanced budget for the first time. Meanwhile, there is zero unemployment in most parts of the country, annual per capita incomes have risen in the last 12 months by 11 per cent to MDollars 8,350 and the overall inflation rate has dropped to 3.7 per cent compared with over 5 per cent early last year. But fast growth has resulted in infrastructure bottlenecks. As in other fast-emerging economies such as Thailand and Indonesia, Malaysia's roads are jammed with vehicles, ports are congested and its power industry lacks capacity. 'The present infrastructural constraints, especially in power and transport, have occurred too often and are now being addressed as a matter of urgency,' said Mr Anwar in his budget speech. Critics say that by not tackling these problems sooner, the government has put at risk further economic growth. The other main problem area is investment. Much of Malaysia's recent economic growth is due to the government's success in luring investments from overseas. Attracted by the country's political stability and its relatively low wages, multinational companies have poured millions of dollars into electronics and other industries. In 1990-91 foreign companies invested about MDollars 17bn in Malaysia's manufacturing sector, representing well over half total investment. In the first seven months of this year foreign investments fell to MDollars 2.4bn. In part the fall-off is because of the tough times being endured by many cash-strapped foreign companies. But it is also because Malaysia is facing stiff competition for investment from countries such as China and Vietnam. 'Every country in this region is trying to offer the best tax package for investors and we cannot be left behind,' says Mr Anwar. The 1994 budget cuts corporate tax by two percentage points to 32 per cent, with a further two-point reduction in 1995. Under the present five-year plan (1991-95) the government's aim was to lessen dependence on foreign investment, with domestic concerns playing a greater role. But this has not happened, even though many Malaysian companies are cash-rich. Domestic investment fell by more than 50 per cent to MDollars 2bn in the first seven months of this year. The 1994 budget includes a number of tax and other incentives to encourage more participation in the economy by domestic concerns. Malaysia's development is also being affected by skills constraints. A comprehensive overhaul of the education system is planned, but there are those who wonder whether the government has delayed too long in taking action. 'Short-term, Malaysia will continue to be a success story,' said one local economist. 'But we've really only made it to the first development plateau. It's going to be a lot tougher from now on.'</p>

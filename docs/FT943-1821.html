			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Arts: Toshiba support for the ICA The Institute of Contemporary Arts, London's guardian of the avant-garde, is to change its name, and, ideally, its home. In future it will be known the ICA (Sponsored by Toshiba), and by the millennium hopes to be in new, more flexible, premises, with Blackfriars Bridge its preferred site. Toshiba, the Japanese electronics manufacturer, is giving the ICA Pounds 500,000 over three years and in return will have its name attached to every piece of publicity material and event at the ICA. It also gets the opportunity to display its newest hardware in the foyer of the ICA's Mall galleries. The money will enable the ICA to mount more adventurous art shows, cinema seasons and plays. The deal also involves support in kind. Toshiba was looking for an arts sponsorship which conveyed cutting edge innovation and the ICA certainly provides that. There will be no interference in programming policy. Although a Nash terrace in the Mall is an unusual and prestigious site for an ikon of the new, the building is the wrong shape. The hunt is on for a new home and architects will be appointed by the end of the year. There is an interesting jetty near Blackfriars Bridge, close to the Tate's proposed Bankside site for its new Gallery of Modern Art, which looks ideal. The cost of the new ICA will be over Pounds 20m and it joins the long queue for lottery money, ideally from the Millennium Fund, perhaps from the Arts Council Lottery cash bank. The council is a good friend of the ICA and raised its grant by 7 per cent this year. But the ICA still manages to earn two thirds of its Pounds 2.4m annual turnover.</p>

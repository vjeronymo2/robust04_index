			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: SINGER LAMENTS THE LACK OF CLUB DATES  IN SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Frustrated by the lack of local club dates for jazz singers, Cath Eckert gave  up on clubs last spring and has been making a living doing casuals -- parties,  weddings, conventions.  </P> <P> She'll be back in a club for the first time since then when she appears  Wednesday evenings, from 5:30 to 9:30 through December, at the U.S. Grant Hotel  lounge downtown.  </P> <P> "My main main love is jazz, and I do it whenever I can," said Eckert. 'But for  a while, I said, 'Forget it, it's too much trouble.' To get a jazz gig, you  have to be able to pack the place, and you end up spending all your time  mailing out flyers."  </P> <P> Eckert said opportunities for jazz singers seem to be at an all-time low in San  Diego.  </P> <P> "I don't know what's happened. You'd think with the popularity of Diane Schuur  and other singers that jazz vocalists would be popular. There are some singers  out there, but mostly doing R&amp;B, 1950s and Top 40 stuff."  </P> <P> At the Grant, Eckert will be singing standards such as Tadd Dameron's "If You  Could See Me Now," Latin versions of jazz pieces such as "I Concentrate on You"  and "Street of Dreams," plus holiday songs including "Have Yourself a Merry  Little Christmas" and "The Christmas Song." She'll be joined by husband Chris  Conner on bass and Mike Wofford on piano.  </P> <P> "Luv in the Afternoon," the new album by San Diegans Jeannie and Jimmy Cheatham  and the Sweet Baby Blues Band, continues the band's punchy blend of jazz and  blues, but with a special grit: the guitar of guest performer Clarence  (Gatemouth) Brown. Brown contributes his bluesy string bends and T-Bone  Walker-inspired jazz-blues lines to three songs. The album mixes originals by  the Cheathams with blues standards such as "Don't You Feel My Leg" and "Baby  Please Don't Go." Jeannie Cheatham's earthy vocals and swinging piano drive the  music.  </P> <P> The music is rock solid, but it doesn't have the heat of the band's live  performances. For that, you can visit Elario's later this month, where they  close 1990 with a weeklong stay that ends New Year's Eve. It's been a busy year  for the Cheathams: They appeared at the Blue Note in New York City and guested  on the "Today Show" in August, played the Chicago Jazz Festival in September  and entertained travelers aboard the S.S. Norway during a jazz cruise to the  Virgin Islands. They also made the cover of the September/October issue of  "Living Blues" magazine, which contained an article on them by San Diegan Jim  Trageser.  </P> <P> John Patitucci, who opens five nights at Elario's on Wednesday, is equally  adept at either electric or acoustic bass. On his new album, "Sketchbook," for  example, Patitucci's playing ranges from earthy, acoustic bass beneath Michael  Brecker's Coltrane-inspired sax on " 'Trane" to a sliding, sensuous sound on  six-string electric bass in the funky "Joab."  </P> <P> Patitucci's significant break came in 1985, when he was asked by Chick Corea to  join the keyboard player's Elektric Band. He continues to play with Corea while  pursuing a solo career.  </P> <P> "Sketchbook" is his third album. Few bassists are worth several minutes of solo  time, but Patitucci is one exception. From the difficult upright bass, for  example, he wrings rapid-fire lines with the ease of the best electric guitar  players, and he matches saxophonists one-on-one, playing speedy melody lines in  unison.  </P> <P> As a composer, Patitucci is coming of age. He wrote most of the music on the  new album (which rated 4 1/2 stars out of 5 in "Downbeat"), and his tastes run  from jazz to funk to Brazilian. At Elario's, Patitucci will be joined by  drummer Vinnie Colaiuta, keyboardist John Beasley and saxophonist Steve  Tavaglione.  </P> <P> Beginning Dec. 10, KIFM (98.1) will operate from quarters matching its slick  on-air image. After four years in an anonymous stucco building in Kearny Mesa,  the station has spent $1.8 million on a 10-year lease, equipment and interior  design for a 6,500-square-foot space in the Tishman Hurst Town Centre in La  Jolla's Golden Triangle, visible from Interstate 5.  </P> <P> A black marble floor and a splotch-painted wall that looks like a moody sky  greet visitors. Other walls are painted in bright shades of blue and grape,  reminiscent of a sixties record store. The new, larger space will accommodate a  growing music collection, which station program director Bob O'Connor hopes to  increase from 125 CDs to 1,000 in the months ahead. The station also has about  1,000 record albums, especially of straight-ahead jazz not available on CDs.  With the popularity of Ron Galon's Sunday night straight-ahead show, the  station plans to expand its straight-ahead collection.  </P> <P> RIFFS: Vocalist Michael Franks kicks off winter's "Simply Jazz" series at East  County Performing Arts Center in El Cajon at 3:30 Sunday afternoon. Tickets are  free, given away over the air on KIFM. . . .  </P> <P> Pianist Kenny Barron will be featured on KPBS-TV's "Club Date" jazz program  Saturday night at 8:30, repeating Monday afternoon at 1:30. . . .  </P> <P> Part 5 of the seven-part Miles Davis radio biography airs at 11 a.m. Thursday  on KSDS-FM (88.3) and at 2 p.m. Saturday on KPBS-FM (89.5). Part 6 will air on  KSDS at 8 p.m. Sunday and again at 11 a.m. Dec. 13. KPBS will play Part 6 at 2  p.m. Dec. 15. Part 5 covers the 1970s and 1980s, including comments from Joe  Zawinul, Keith Jarrett and Airto, and musical demonstrations by Lenny White,  Jason Miles and Sonny Fortune. . . .  </P> <P> Flutist Holly Hofmann teams up with singer-pianist-guitarist Ronn Satterfield  of Checkfield on Friday and Saturday nights at 8 at All That Jazz in Rancho  Bernardo. . . .  </P> <P> Guitarist Peter Sprague and vocalist Kevyn Lettau are bound to include a few  Brazilian tunes in their sets Friday and Saturday night at 8:30 at Horton Grand  Hotel's palace bar downtown. . . .  </P> <P> Tobacco Road plays vintage jazz at the U.S. Grant Hotel lounge downtown Friday  nights, from 6 to 10 through December. . . .  </P> <P> City Rock, the club at Fourth Avenue and E Street downtown, reopens Saturday  night with the Brazilian jazz of Sole Mar, which continues Friday and Saturday  nights through December.  </P></p>

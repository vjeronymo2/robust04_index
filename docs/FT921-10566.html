			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Leading Article: German boom into bust PERVERSE as it may seem, this week's strike-averting pay deal in the German steel industry has, if anything, thickened the cloud of uncertainty that hangs over the country's economy. The agreement sets a worrying precedent for the wage round; it is one which neither German industry nor the unions can afford to follow. If they try, they will eventually fail - the Bundesbank will see to that. But in failing, they will do unnecessary and long-lasting damage to the newly united Germany. It would be wrong to be prematurely apocalyptic. The steel agreement, a total pay rise of 6.4 per cent, is the tail-end of last year's pay round, a round in which the average settlement was above 7 per cent. Moreover, the haste with which it was agreed might suggest that IG Metall, the metal industry union, has made some more comforting promises behind the scenes. It is the outcome of the forthcoming negotiations in the engineering industry and public sector that will determine whether this optimism is justified. Yet the Bundesbank is unlikely to see it in such a rosy light - rightly so. Last year's settlements pushed the German rate of inflation above those in France and profligate Britain. The rise in German interest rates in late December was intended to send a tough message to wage bargainers, a message that the troubled steel industry has chosen to ignore. Tense present The Bundesbank will be tempted to ram its point home harder still: settlements around 6 per cent are at least a percentage point higher than can be tolerated in a low inflation country, such as Germany is, or was. The Bundesbank wants to keep this label in the present tense: this implies a tense present. High interest rates are likely for the next six months at least. Premature easing would be interpreted by the markets as a sign of weakness, especially if broad money growth remains outside its target zone. Inevitably, then, west Germany's economic boom will be followed by a traditionally British recession. The longer that the Bundesbank is forced to keep rates high, the deeper it will be. The root of this year's problem was also the cause of the boom that preceded it: German unification. Monetary union has prompted an economic collapse in the eastern Lander on a scale that even the pessimists underestimated. Cushioning the blow has required huge transfers from the west. Tax burden Yet the German government has failed to build a consensus over how this tax burden should be distributed. Workers, the unions argue, have shouldered more than their fair share through higher income taxes, with a rise in value-added tax in the pipeline. After-tax incomes grew by 3.8 per cent in the year to the second quarter of 1991, but by just 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, when the income tax surcharge came into effect. Yet the unions' attempt to claw back this lost after-tax income through higher wage claims cannot work. In the end, the former west Germans will pay for unification; but only once-high interest rates and rising unemployment have beaten wages down. As the west German economy catches a cold it imposes high interest rates and slow growth on the rest of Europe. But the east German Lander will pay the highest price: both economically, as output stagnates and investment fails to materialise; and politically, as the unwillingness of the west to make the necessary sacrifices sinks in. All of this represents a failure on the part of Germany's political leaders. The rigidly regulated west German labour market was always going to find unification difficult to cope with in the manner of the free market textbooks. But the social consensus alternative has not materialised. Until last summer, Mr Kohl was unwilling even to acknowledge that the burden existed. Into this policy vacuum the Bundesbank has stepped. It is imposing a third way that is both economically costly and politically damaging for the new Germany. Unless its politicians, employers and unions can act together, and soon, the outlook is decidedly bleak.</p>

			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / UK Company News: New growth ambitions for a 'disciplined' BP British Petroleum will announce new growth targets this week, its first since the boardroom coup that tilted it into crisis 2 1/2 years ago. Mr David Simon, chief executive, will set out to City analysts the company's objectives for key financial indicators over the next two years: earnings, capital spending, and debt reduction. These will reflect the directors' belief that BP's financial health has been restored to the point where it can develop new growth ambitions. But with memories of the recent crisis not entirely eradicated, the stress will be on 'discipline' and a strong balance sheet. On dividends, Mr Simon is expected to say that increases will be paid when justified by the company's improved performance. In an interview with the FT, Mr Simon - who will take over as chairman of the company next summer - said: 'We now have a 2 1/2 -year track record. However, the group remains totally committed to performance improvement.' The recovery was only 'a gateway to disciplined growth', Mr Simon added. The earnings target will suggest that the company sees substantial scope to boost its earnings well beyond the Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) a year target it set in 1992. The key to improved performance will be volume growth, improvements in internal processes and continued cost cutting, according to Mr Simon. Both Mr Simon and Mr John Browne, the current head of exploration who will take over as chief executive in July, believe there are attractive growth options in the upstream and downstream segments of the business. The capital spending target is therefore likely to show an increase over this year's Dollars 3.8bn as the group seeks to expand the business once again. BP will continue to pay down its Dollars 10bn debt until it reaches the level of comparably sized oil companies such as Chevron and Mobil of the US. Mr Simon said BP was uncomfortable with debt levels which caused it to stand out among its peers. 'We want to get back into the woodwork,' he said. Mr Browne emphasised that BP was determined to restore its international reputation: 'It's the heart of our business.' Restored to health, Page 17</p>

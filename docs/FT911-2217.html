			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: MacSharry calls for new realism about subsidies A NEW realism about gradual dismantling of farm subsidies is needed to get a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round trade liberalisation talks, according to Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner. Speaking on the eve of his first talks in Washington tomorrow with Mr Ed Madigan, the new US secretary for agriculture, he stressed that 'it is important to be realistic because it's becoming much more difficult to deliver' on the EC offer, the rejection of which brought the round to a standstill in December. But Mr MacSharry confirmed that he wanted to put the details of his radical plan to reform the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) to EC farm ministers in June - whether or not member states resolve their two-month old dispute over this year's price package by then. Mr MacSharry said the EC's offer remained the same, a 30 per cent cut in domestic farm subsidies over 10 years counted from 1986. He insisted that this would unlock more access to the EC market for farm produce, as well as bring down export subsidies. But EC member states' continuing inability to agree to keep within this year's spending guidelines, growing pressure from east European imports and signs of subsidy increases by competitors like the US had made internal consensus on even this offer harder. The US and the 14-nation Cairns Group of agri-exporters led by Australia insisted at last December's failed Gatt summit on a 75 per cent cut in internal subsidies and 90 per cent reduction of export refunds over the next 10 years. But the commissioner pointed out that the Community's adversaries in the round had moved from their original demand for total elimination of subsidies to an acceptance of a 50 per cent cut in internal support when the round broke up. Talks have since resumed in Geneva to define technically what constitutes each class of subsidy, and Mr MacSharry hoped Gatt would produce a framework paper by July, enabling a ministerial attempt to break the deadlock in the autumn. The reform plan now scheduled for June, intended to move the emphasis of farm support from subsidised prices to direct payments to farmers, so cutting output and eventually export subsidies, is the Uruguay Round's main beacon of hope. Confirmation that Mr MacSharry intends to press ahead with its timetable should strengthen the hand of Mr Madigan and Mrs Carla Hills, the US special trade representative, whom the commissioner will also see. They are pushing Congress to renew the US administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority, vital to get the round through as a package which US legislators cannot undo parts of. The EC commissioner had originally intended to wait until this year's price package was out of the way before continuing the reform offensive, in line with the Commission's almost theological desire to keep these two issues and the inter-related Gatt talks separate. Mr MacSharry said he personally wanted to see a full six months debate before introducing reform, so it would begin to bite in the 1992 farming year. Tactically, the Commission wants to avoid the current farm budget wrangle going to the European summit of June 29, in case member governments fix new spending guidelines which pre-empt the severe cuts envisaged in the reform. Privately, senior officials admit the Gatt-CAP link by expressing concern that the Uruguay Round timetable could collide with the US electoral timetable unless EC farm reform is speeded up.</p>

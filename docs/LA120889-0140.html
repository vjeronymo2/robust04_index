			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY;  </P> <P> ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE IS TAKEN TO SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Preventing drug use among South County's student population was the topic  Thursday as a dozen local politicians spoke to high school seniors at three  high schools.  </P> <P> The anti-drug crusade came during the first Government in Education day  sponsored by the Capistrano Unified School District.  </P> <P> Although city, state and federal officials said they were encouraged by the  positive responses during their classroom visits, the students painted a  grimmer picture of campus drug use and the ineffectiveness of programs like the  "Just Say No" campaign.  </P> <P> "A lot of people don't take it seriously," said one 17-year-old senior who said  he no longer uses drugs. "I used to laugh at 'Just Say No' all the time. And  I'm clean now, but I could get (drugs) any time if I wanted them."  </P> <P> The message taken to the classrooms by Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), city  officials from Dana Point, Mission Viejo and San Clemente, and aides to two  state assemblymen was that the war on drugs begins with the individual.  </P> <P> But the politicians also acknowledged that their message probably had little  effect on the beliefs of drug users in an age group that is not old enough to  vote and pays little attention to government issues.  </P> <P> "You can't (stop drug use) by standing in front of a class and lecturing," said  Dana Point Councilman William Bamattre. "Most kids say they do drugs out of  curiosity."  </P> <P> Instead, the officials said, the answer to preventing drug use among teen-agers  is to use role models such as school athletes and celebrities and to establish  a bottom line that the student is responsible for his own choices -- not the  choices of his parents or teachers.  </P> <P> Presentations by local police departments, ex-drug addicts and other anti-drug  campaigns have proved successful, said Nancy Smith, principal of Ole Hanson  Elementary School in San Clemente.  </P> <P> But some students disagreed.  </P> <P> "I don't really think any of this has much impact," said Capistrano Valley High  School senior Gretchen Fleishcli, 17.  </P> <P> "It's nice to hear the facts from someone who makes decisions for us, but there  is always going to be a struggle."

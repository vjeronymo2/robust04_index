			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / International Company News: Air France plans tour unit merger AIR France, the state-controlled French airline, plans to join forces in the tour operation business with Havas, the French media and leisure group, and TUI, the German travel company. The merged company, called Jet Tours, will be one of the largest tour operators in Europe. It will combine SOTAIR, the tour operator currently controlled by Air France with Havas as a minority shareholder, with SFTA, a joint venture between Havas and TUI. Once the merger, still subject to approval by the three companies' administrative boards and workers' committees, is completed Jet Tours will have an annual turnover of FFr3bn (Dollars 566m) and 700,000 clients. Air France will be the majority shareholder, leaving Havas and TUI each with 20 per cent. Mr Bernard Attali, chairman of Air France, said the new company would have sufficient critical mass to 'be able to fight more effectively against the big European tour groups'. Air France, and the two other shareholders, hope to cut administrative costs after the merger and also to use Jet Tours' size to secure better terms from suppliers. SOTAIR, France's third-largest tour operator, specialises in long-haul destinations, and SFTA, number five in the French market, in medium-haul tours. They already co-operate in certain areas, notably in Atoll, the reservation service that they own jointly. The merger comes at a time when European tour operators are under intense pressure because of the impact of the economic slowdown and exchange rate fluctuations on the holiday industry.</p>

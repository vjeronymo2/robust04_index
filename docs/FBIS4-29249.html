			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 15 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il extended thanks to an official and different units  that had distinguished themselves in displaying the beautiful  tradition of army-civilian unity. His thanks went to the Korea  joint-venture bank, Yanggang Hotel, Pyongyang University of  Railways, the national training centre of the State Commission  of Physical Culture and Sports, the soy and edible oil direct  sales store in Pyongyang, the Mangyongdae District fuel supply  base and Pak Kyong-mi, a reporter with the Inmin Pogon Office.    In the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today the drive  for aiding the People's Army is going on briskly as a social  movement and, through it, the Army and civilians form an  integrated whole, hardening their determination to resolutely  defend the party and the leader and safeguard the Korean-style  socialist system.</p>

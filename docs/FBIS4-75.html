			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 31 SAPA -- African National Congress  President Mandela's interference in the police operation  investigating Monday's [28 March] killings in central  Johannesburg was unacceptable, the National Party [NP] said in a  statement on Thursday. NP media spokesman Danie du Plessis said  the laws that applied to other political parties should also  apply to the ANC.    Police Commissioner Gen Johan van der Merwe's statement that  Mr Mandela had offered to hand over weapons found at the ANC's  Shell House headquarters once more highlighted that the ANC had  become "a law unto themselves", he said.    "This incident follows others such as the ANC's treasury  department asking the Reserve Bank for finrand access so it  could use funds held abroad to buy a Pretoria building. It also  asked for import duties to be waived on election materials such  as electronic equipment, land rovers and t-shirts," Mr du  Plessis said.    "If the ANC has nothing to hide, why did Mr Mandela  interfere  to prevent the police from searching Shell House?" the NP  statement said.    ANC officials are investigating Gen van der Merwe's claims  that Mr Mandela offered to hand over weapons.    Enquiries since early Thursday on the statement had still  not  been answered by the ANC by Thursday afternoon.</p>

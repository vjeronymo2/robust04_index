			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROP. 109: GOVERNOR NEEDS IT  </P> <P> Proposition 109 is designed to give California governors more time to decide  whether proposed new laws are good for the state or not. We recommend a Yes  vote because it is irresponsible to argue for speed when bad law may result.  </P> <P> Last year, for example, Gov. George Deukmejian had to decide whether to sign or  veto 1,700 bills, all but 300 of which were introduced in the final months of  the session.  </P> <P> Because it was an odd-numbered year, he had just 12 days after each bill  arrived to decide whether he should sign it or whether some technical or policy  flaw called for a veto. After l2 days, the calendar snatches the matter away  from him. Under the state Constitution, a bill becomes law whether the governor  likes it or not.  </P> <P> In even-numbered years, the governor gets 30 days to decide. The assumption is  that bills that are carried over from odd to even years tend to be more  controversial than bills that sail through. That being the case, it is presumed  that the governor is entitled to more time to look them over.  </P> <P> Proposition 109, supported by Deukmejian, would extend the review period to 30  days for all sessions. The only formal opposition argues that the extension of  time for analysis would give lobbyists and others more time to twist the  governor's arm and make back-room deals, which says, in effect, that there  should be time for back-room deals only every other year. The governor is  entitled to all the time he can get. He is entitled to a Yes on Proposition  109.  </P></p>

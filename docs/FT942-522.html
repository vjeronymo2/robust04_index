			<p>940629 FT  29 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Local columns reflect a world event - Patrick Harverson in New York on generous US press coverage Clearly, newspapers in the US do not believe in opinion polls. How else to explain devoting so much space to the World Cup despite the Harris poll which found that 71 per cent of Americans did not know that the tournament was being held in the US, and that 62 per cent did not know that the World Cup sport was soccer? It would be understandable if US newspapers provided only modest coverage of the World Cup - deep in the sports section - and stuck to what readers want most: baseball, basketball, golf, and more baseball. Yet newspapers in the country's biggest cities have displayed uncommon interest in a game that usually warrants no more than a line or two a week on the sports pages. The New York Times, for example, has been carrying two or three pages of scores, reports and features every day: impressive, considering that the city's basketball and ice hockey teams were both competing for their respective league titles this month. The Big Apple's three tabloids - Post, News, Newsday - are also feasting at the World Cup trough, while elsewhere, papers such as the Los Angeles Times, Washington Post, Boston Globe and US Today have kept readers fully informed. The fact that the majority of their readers probably know little about soccer has not deterred papers from covering the World Cup in detail. Jeff Miller, an assistant sports editor at the Dallas Morning Herald, which has been devoting up to two pages a day to the World Cup, says: 'This is the biggest thing in the world and we are trying to treat it like that, even if it does not register as such with our readers.' Other papers say their coverage of the World Cup is not aimed only at regular readers. The Orlando Sentinel is publishing a special World Cup section every day during the first round of games. Aside from the regular run of news and features, the country's newspapers have also allowed their top sports columnists - the pit-bulls of American journalism - to sink their teeth into the World Cup. In spite of an instinctive dislike of soccer, some appear to have been won over by the sport's charms. Tony Kornheiser of the Washington Post admitted last week that he normally regards soccer 'as somewhat less appealing than a case of hives,' yet confessed that he fell in love with the World Cup after attending the Holland-Saudi Arabia game. Admittedly, his ardour was primarily stirred by the fact that soccer games are short in duration compared to the marathons of American sports. He wrote: 'I love the World Cup because of its running time, and there are no commercial timeouts, and no injury timeouts, and no full timeouts, and no 20-second timeouts . . . It's over in two hours. So if you say: 'Honey, it's a 7:30 start; I'll be home by 9:45,' then by God, you will.' Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe went further, declaring after seeing Argentina defeat Greece: 'I take it all back. Futbol is my life.' This kind of coverage is delighting the World Cup's organisers, who feared that the notoriously anti-soccer US press might use the tournament as an excuse to churn out the same old story about soccer being a boring, low-scoring game played, as one sportswriter memorably put it, by 'commie pansies'. It was Hank Steinbrecher, head of the US soccer federation, who said just before the tournament started: 'I know soccer isn't the most popular sport in the US, but soccer-bashing might be the most popular sport among the media.' But bashing has been kept to a minimum, and for good reason. For newspapers, the arrival of the world's most important sporting event in their backyard is news in a way that transcends sport. In a country always worried that it will be viewed as parochial, any event with the word 'world' in its title catches the eye, and editors have not been shy about informing their readers of the important role their cities are playing. 'The eyes of the world will be on Boston/Orlando/Detroit this morning . . .' was probably the most commonly used introduction to press coverage in the opening week. In addition, many of the nine cities hosting the games are home to large European and Latin American immigrant communities. As a result, papers in places such as Los Angeles, New York and Chicago dared not alienate their home-grown soccer-obsessed constituencies by underplaying the World Cup's significance . But the event has not worked its magic everywhere. Newspapers in the cities not hosting the games have found it a less compelling story. Among weekly magazines, coverage is patchy. Sports Illustrated has led the way, although its pages remain dominated by baseball and the recent climax of the basketball season. Among general interest publications, Newsweek has taken the most bullish line on the World Cup. Two weeks ago it published a special issue, followed that up with a cover story a week later, and then ran five colourful pages on the first 10 days of games. Its chief rival, Time, has taken a very different tack, all but ignoring the tournament's first week-and-a-half of play. True, Time did wake up to the World Cup after the US team stunned the football world with a 2-1 victory over favoured Colombia, yet it still ran only a modest one-page report. For sports fans, the tournament is now playing on a less crowded stage. The basketball season ended last week, and with baseball moving towards its mid-season break under the cloud of a possible players' strike, World Cup soccer has an opportunity, if the US press affords it the space, to leave a lasting imprint on the nation's sports consciousness.</p>

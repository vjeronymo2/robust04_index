			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Nigeria in new bid to agree debt relief deal MR ERNEST Shonekan, head of Nigeria's Transitional Council, will try to revive the quest for official debt relief when he arrives in Paris for informal talks with the French government and the Paris Club tomorrow. His attempt to agree a med-ium-term economic strategy with the International Monetary Fund before he leaves office following elections in August is threatened by a deep split over the handling of the exchange rate between the Central Bank of Nigeria and Mr Oladele Olashore, finance minister. The latest round of talks with an IMF and World Bank team ended in stalemate earlier this month, when Mr Olashore offered no positive action to float the naira or remove the domestic subsidy on petroleum products, both pre-conditions of an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility. Although exchange rate policy is the responsibility of Mr Abdulkadir Ahmed, governor of the central bank, Mr Ola-shore has insisted on the need to control the parallel market, where the naira is worth about 70 per cent less than the official rate of N21.99 to the dollar. The IMF is also dissatisfied by the Nigerian delegation's fiscal stance for the first quarter of 1993, according to those close to the talks. Nigeria has reported revenue of about N31bn (Pounds 940m) to the end of March, about N6bn below budget projection, in spite of higher than forecast oil prices and production levels. The Fund estimates that revenue was around N45bn for the period and wants to see full disclosure of oil proceeds by the state-owned Nigerian Nat-ional Petroleum Corporation. The probable source of the discrepancy is the oil revenue which goes directly into 'dedication accounts' to pay for large infrastructure projects and the military campaign in Liberia. The Fund has asked for a breakdown of expenditure and a review of existing commitments, especially projects which contribute little to productivity or could be taken over by the private sector. Mr Shonekan has tried to bring the dedication accounts into the overall budget through the fiscal co-ordination committee, which he chairs. He has also set up a budget monitoring committee composed of experts outside government to review fiscal performance and recommend changes in budget allocation. The budget committee is due to disclose its first report on Tuesday The IMF is also looking for more action by the government to mop up excess liquidity and suspension of additional borrowing. Government borrowing has been the main cause of inflation, which is more than 60 per cent a year, and has reduced the supply of foreign exchange to the private sector. During the first two months of 1993 the government has slowed the growth of broad money supply, which reached 56 per cent in 1992, and aggregate credit fell 6.5 per cent during the same period as a result of firm controls on spending. Mr Shonekan will be accompanied to Paris by Mr Ahmed but not by Mr Olashore, who is attending the African Development Bank's annual meeting. Mr Shonekan's team is running out of time if it is to achieve its goal of setting out a shadow IMF programme which the incoming civilian regime can follow when it takes over on August 27.</p>

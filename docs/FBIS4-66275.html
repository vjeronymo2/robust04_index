			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by staff reporters Zhang Bosen (1728 2672 2773) and </F> Gu Xiaoqian (7357 1321 0051) and New China News Agency reporter  Wen Youcheng (5113 2589 2052): "Convert Resource Superiority  Into Economic Superiority To Accelerate the Pace of Henan  Development: An Interview With a Delegate, Henan Governor Ma  Zhongchen"]    [Text] Premier Li Peng stated in the "Government Work  Report": "This year's economic work should deepen reform, expand  opening, strengthen and improve macroscopic adjustment and  control, vigorously readjust the economic mix, promote  technological progress, enthusiastically develop markets,  improve economic efficiency, and control inflation to ensure the  lasting, rapid, and healthy development of the national  economy." What will Henan do? When interviewed by this reporter,  the delegate, Henan Governor Ma Zhongchen [7456 1813 5256]  stated, "We must speed up Henan's development by converting our  resource advantages into economic superiority."    Delegate Ma Zhongchen said that Henan was located in the  inner platform, so it is a major province for resources. There  are 107 types of mineral products found in Henan, and among the  verified mineral products, 49 are listed among the top ten  nationally, including 12 types listed among the top three. The  three energy mineral products of coal, oil, and natural gas, the  four metal mineral products of aluminium, gold, molybdenum, and  silver, and such non-metal mineral products as refractory clay,  cement stone, salt, trona, solvent limestone, pearlite, and  orchid asbestos are especially rich. The area is also very rich  in arable land and output of agricultural products and  by-products, with winter wheat, beans, cotton, and tobacco, as  well as various fruits, and reserve quantities of large  livestock all listed first in the nation. Transportation extends  in all directions, the highways cover the province as densely as  a spider's web, and air flights connect Henan with more than 20  Chinese cities, Hong Kong and Japan. The North-South and  East-West central coaxial cables intersect at Zhengzhou.  Seventeen prefectures or cities and 83 counties (cities) have  operational domestic direct dial telephones, with a provincial  total of over 500,000 automatic exchange phones. Henan is first  nationally in underground cultural relics, second in  above-ground relics, and our museum collections rank third in  the nation. Since reform and opening, we have made our base upon  developing our resource superiority, and have made great  progress economically. In 1993, Henan's GDP was up to 158  billion yuan, a 15.7 percent increase over 1992, and 9.7 times  that of 1978.    However, Delegate Ma Zhongchen pointed out that "Due to the  affects of the economic division under the traditional economic  system and limitations on capital and technology, Henan has not  significantly altered its status of being a producing and  exporting base for agricultural products, by-products, energy  resource, raw materials and major primary level products, so we  have not maximized our resource advantage, and our resource  efficiency is not high enough. Viewed from the opposite angle,  it demonstrates that the Henan economy has great potential for  development. Therefore, the key to accelerating Henan's economic  development lies in further releasing the huge potential its of  resource advantages, doing our best to convert this resource  advantage into economic advantage." Ma Zhongchen said firmly,  with emphasis in his voice, "We have therefore laid out the  general idea that developing Henan's economy in the future lies  in accelerating the process of national economic marketization,  implementing a comprehensive strategy for developing industry  and agriculture. We must use the cities to promote the  countryside, completely opening up and developing from a high  starting point, facing toward both the overseas and domestic  markets, going the way of deep processing with value adding  driven by the resource advantages. Convert our resource  advantages into economic advantage."    "But, how do you convert resource advantages into economic  advantage?" the correspondent asked.    "First of all, we must strengthen the market economic  concept, try to realize the four changes', and do a good job on  three key points' of developing resource advantages." Delegate  Ma Zhongchen explained that, "The so-called four changes' are,  one, change from fixing projects according to resources to  fixing them by market requirements; two, change from driving  processing value adding by exploiting resource advantages into  driving exploiting resource advantages by deep processing value  adding; three, change from mainly facing inward for developing  resources into developing resources facing the overseas and the  domestic market, while giving special attention right now to  developing export oriented industry, enterprises and products;  four, change from developing and using solely local resources  into a base of using both international and domestic, especially  taking full advantage of foreign capital, technology, expertise  and information resources, to realize bilateral compensation  through the province's advantages in land, agricultural products  and by-products, mineral products and labor force resources.    "Principally, the `three key points' are:    (1) Vigorously develop the deep processing of advantageous  mineral resources, really working on five industrial systems:  coal-electricity, coal chemicals, petrochemicals, aluminium and  construction materials.    1. Focus on coal-electricity, vigorously developing deep  processing for primary energy. Henan not only has rich coal  resources, we are also close to two coal bases in southeastern  Shanxi and Shaanxi, which is very favorable for development of  the Kengkou and Lukou power stations. By the end of the century,  we will build Henan into an important coal-electricity base with  a 12 to 15 million KW generator capacity in the united national  electricity network. We will try to add 3.5 million KW of  generator capacity during the Eighth Five Year Plan, and will  try to add 6.5 million KW during the Ninth Five Year Plan.    2. Develop the coal chemicals industry on the base of  advantageous coal resources. Led by nylon 66 salt, based on coal  tar processing, we are developing synthetic materials and fine  chemical industry products while developing basic chemical raw  materials. There are projects which have been set by the state,  such as the Pingdingshan nylon 66 salt project, Pingdingshan  coal tar project, Yima gas chemicals project, etc.    3. Make oil, natural gas-fuel, oil-chemical fibre and  plastics a deep processing chain to develop the petrochemical  industry. Relying on the oil and gas resources of the Zhongyuan  Oil Field, Henan Oil Field and the five million tons of raw oil  processing at the Luoyang Oil Refinery, we will gradually  establish a Luoyang petrochemical industrial base focused on oil  refining, chemical fibre and plastic production, a Puyang  petrochemical industrial base focused on production of chemical  fertilizer and ethylene, and a Nanyang petrochemical industrial  base focused on high-density oil treatment and natural soda.    4. Make aluminium oxide-fine aluminium-aluminium  materials-aluminium products an aluminium deep processing chain.  As one of 20 projects being promoted by Henan Province, the  Great Wall Aluminium Industry Corporation has an annual  aluminium oxide production output of 1.2 million tons, aluminium  electrolysis of 500,000 tons and 300,000 tons of aluminium  materials. Among these, the first stage of a 200,000 ton  aluminium oxide project at the Zhongzhou Aluminium Plant is now  being completed. After completion, this project will be the  biggest aluminium industry base in China.    5. Led by cement, glass, and advanced refractory materials  in  the construction materials industry, increase the pace of deep  processing products by means of developing enterprises on an  appropriate scale. Our hope is to establish industrial sectors  which will be national leaders and correspond to our resource  advantages.    2) Do a good job of adding value by deep processing in the  sphere of "agriculture."    Gross output depends on the depth to which agricultural  products are processed, that is. the final form of the product.  Therefore, agricultural development in Henan will depend on how  deep is the processing of agricultural products. We regard the  deep processing of agricultural products and by-products as a  breakthrough point for vigorously developing Henan's economy,  and around "agriculture" will do a good job in the light textile  industry to realize good circulation of promoting industry  through agriculture and building agriculture through industry;  focus on doing well the deep processing of nine big series and  18 varieties of products, such as cotton-cotton  processing-textiles-clothes, wheat-flour-fine foods, tobacco  leaves-double curing-cigarettes, papermaking, winemaking,  peanuts, corn, fruits and vegetables, comprehensive poultry and  livestock processing, etc. We will gradually establish an  industrial system for the deep processing and fine processing of  agricultural products and by-products on a suitable scale and  certain technological level. In this part of the work, we have  attained certain achievements: Henan's monosodium glutamate and  ham production are on a certain scale, with a very high sales  rate in the domestic market. We have chosen to give priority  in development to agriculture and its by-products, with food  products, and to the textile industry as a leading industry, as  well as bringing along other light industrial development such  as papermaking, leather, medicine, etc.    (3) Exploit our geographical superiority and develop our  cultural resources.    At present, we are making rapid progress in key  infrastructural projects, with periodic achievements in such  areas as transportation, telecommunications and tourism. Among  10 tourism projects for exploiting cultural resources, there is  the original site of the "foolish old man who moved the  mountain" in Jiyuan, Kuilichen in Tangyin, the "little Yellow  River" channel excavation in the Yellow River Daguan, the  reconstruction project of digging a channel according to the  "Qingming Shanghe Picture" in Kaifeng. These are in general  completed and opened to tourists, while the construction of  other projects is in full swing. Construction of the Henan  Provincial Museum, which will exhibit the cream of Henan's  antiquities, will be completed and the museum operational this  year.    In order to bring about conversion from resource superiority  to economic superiority, we must also adopt some practical  measures, giving serious attention to implementation. In this  regard, we plan to focus on giving force to the following five  aspects:    One: add force to deepen reform, insisting on maintaining  the  dominance of public ownership, vigorously developing the various  economic component parts. Of Henan's more than 149.3 billion  yuan gross industrial output value at the town level and above,  individual industry and "three types of capital" industry in  urban and suburban areas is less than 20 percent, so there is  great potential here. According to what is required to develop  the socialist market economy, we must persist in the principle  of developing whatever suitable economic component sector that  fits, bringing the enthusiasm of each sector into full play,  pushing the provincial economy to a new level.    Two: add force to improving the investment environment,  expanding our opening toward the outside, with wide use of  foreign capital, technology and human resources. At present,  Henan is fully supporting construction of 10 major  infrastructural projects, including Zhengzhou's new airport and  a group of freeways. We are trying our best through  environmental beautification and excellent service to provide  the most favorable conditions for attracting foreign businessmen  to invest in Henan in various forms, based on our resource  superiority, and vigorously developing "three types of capital"  enterprises. We are trying to exploit more than $1 billion in  foreign capital in each of the last two years of the Eighth Five  Year Plan.    Three: add force to pushing scientific and technical  progress, improving the technological content of the domestic  economy a great deal. Liberate scientific and technological  workers, accelerating the conversion of high and new  technological achievements to productive force. Meanwhile, make  a major effort to replace technology in industrial enterprises.  During the final two years of the Eighth and Ninth Five Year  Plans, we plan to choose about 50 enterprises (groups) whose  industrial sales productive output value are expected soon to be  over 500 million yuan, to conduct a name brand strategy,  concentrating capital to support their technology replacement,  extend their products chain, cultivate leading edge products,  establish economic scale, and produce economic giants. By the  year 2000, we hope to achieve an average annual new increase in  industrial marketing production output value of over 2 billion  yuan, with taxes on profits of more than 200,000 yuan in these  enterprises. It is very possible that key projects in areas  which are capital and technology intensive, such as petroleum,  chemicals, deep processing of nonferrous metals, electricity,  etc., will start construction with designs which select  internationally advanced technical equipment from the late  eighties and the nineties.    Four: add force in amassing construction capital through  multiple channels and forms, with a stress on key construction  projects. In addition to vigorously exploiting foreign capital,  vigorously develop a joint-stock system, taking fullest  advantage of a variety of financial measures, such as stocks,  bonds, etc., under the supervision of the state's policies. Take  advantage of society's extra capital in multiple areas, at  multiple levels, via multiple channels, in multiple forms and in  multiple ways, accelerating construction of 20 development  projects throughout the province, and increasing the staying  power of economic development throughout the province.    Five: add force in bilateral economic coordination,  welcoming  coastal provinces to invest and develop resources in Henan. With  the rapid development of the coastal economy, there is a growing  demand by basic products for energy and raw materials, an area  in which Henan has an exclusive superiority. We have instituted  bilateral favorable and beneficial policies, and warmly welcome  coastal and economic developed areas to co-exploit our  province's resources, promoting co-economic prosperity.</p>

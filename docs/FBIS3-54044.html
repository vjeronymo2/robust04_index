In a statement issued at the end of its Central  Committee meeting, the KRP reiterated that it would place all  its energy, its masses, and its friends at leader President  Saddam Husayn's disposal in defense of the people and the  homeland.    In its final statement, the KRP Central Committee denounced  the imperialist-Zionist conspiracy against Iraq, and urged the  international community to shoulder its full legal, human, and  moral responsibility to lift, immediately and unconditionally,  the blockade imposed on the Iraqi people.    The Central Committee condemned the criminal, terrorist, and  destructive plan of the foreigner's agents, led by Jalal  Talabani and Mas'ud Barzani in Kurdistan, stressing support for  the Kurdish masses' perpetual struggle and their heroic daily  confrontation of the agents of the foreigners. The KRP also  stressed its determination to defend Kurdish national rights  against slogan traders and brokers of international politics,  who have turned the Kurdish cause into a commodity for  bargaining and cheap blackmail in order to achieve their evil  intentions. It also pledged to defend the homeland and  safeguard the achievements and gains, which the 17-30 July  revolution has given to the Kurdish people under the leadership  of leader President Saddam Husayn, foremost of which is the  Autonomous Region law.    The Central Committee emphasized the KRP's solidarity with  the Palestinian Arab people to enable them to determine their  fate and it denounced the American and the Zionist role in  liquidating the Palestine question. It condemned the  foreigners' occupation of Somalia, as well as the Egyptian  regime's criminal positions against the Egyptian militant  popular forces, and stressed the KRP's solidarity with the  Yemeni people. It also said in its final statement that the  Arab nation has no choice but unity and economic integration to  confront all foreign challenges.    The KRP then warned the international community in general  and the Arab nation in particular of the serious role U.S.  imperialism is playing to control the world economy, and  appealed to the international community to work to end the  imperialist hegemony over the international organization.</p>

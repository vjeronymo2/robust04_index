			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Travel: In Megalopolis only the veneer is modern - Cosmopolitan Buenos Aires is a city best at remembering the past I did not think I would like Buenos Aires. Everyone I met along the way told me I would not. 'What's the point? It's a big, modern, noisy city,' said a New Yorker I bumped into on a trail in the Andes. 'You want somewhere exotic, sensual, a city with palm trees - try Rio,' suggested a Norwegian from his hammock in the Amazon basin. 'It is not really South America at all,' said a Parisian I met buying an alpaca poncho in an Indian village. 'You might as well be at home.' They were right, of course. Buenos Aires is cosmopolitan, a western-style city with little of the allure, the climate, the strange people and odd sights that usually attract travellers to South America. Why, indeed, go to such a distant place only to feel so close to home? But my fellow travellers were wrong, too. Buenos Aires' first-world sophistication on a rough-hewn, third-world continent is remarkable in itself, and I ended up liking the city very much. Wild and woolly South America ends, and civilised Buenos Aires begins, at Tigre, a small Argentine town at the confluence of the Uruguay and Parana Rivers. North and east it is no distance by boat to Uruguay and a great spongy river delta where channels of water twist and braid and meander off into the distance of a vast continent. But Tigre is also a city suburb, the last station on Buenos Aires' northern commuter railway line. Just 30km to the south lies the heart of a great metropolis of more than 12m people. Something struck a chord as I sat in the Tigre train heading to Buenos Aires' Retiro station. After weeks of Latin American exotica, the suburbs of the city, seen through a train window, were all so familiar and banal that I felt a sense of deja vu. I was on every commuter train I had ever taken in every city I had ever lived. I recognised those men in suits, briefcases in one hand, folded newspapers in the other, standing on the platform at San Isidro station. I recognised the dusty plasterers waiting at working-class Victoria; the rock-music graffiti scrawled on the walls at Nunez; the Italian restaurants at Belgrano; the neglected houses of the poor at Virreyes; the private school children in caps and ties at Olivos; the shopping centre at Rivadavia; the family estate car parked outside the phony Tudor half-beam house at Vincente Lopez. They were part of my own urban life. All big city dwellers from the west, I knew before I arrived, would find something of themselves in Buenos Aires. Downtown Buenos Aires roars, a commotion of people in a hurry. There is a good dose of brash energy in the air. The city is laid on a grid pattern of rectangular blocks. You can look for miles down canyons of buildings. Fleets of yellow-and-black taxis cruise the avenues, their drivers as happy to run you down as blink. Hot-dog carts dominate busy street corners. In the chic Recoleta district, professional dog-walkers trail behind gaggles of canines while their owners  -thin women of impeccable taste - move between boutique, private gallery and exclusive pastry shop. All interesting enough, considering the continent that surrounds it. But there are hundreds of such middle-class cities about. And, quite frankly, there does not seem to be much left of the once-touted romance of Argentina. It has been swallowed in the noise and traffic of a megalopolis. The days of the gaucho are long gone, as are the huge fortunes that were made on the pampa through wheat and cattle. The playboy Argentine millionaire with his vast estancia and polo ponies seems to have disappeared, as have the strains of the tango that used to float through dance-halls and the crowded quarters of the city. A brutal military dictatorship, a futile war with Britain and a pre-occupation with continuing economic crisis seem to have effaced much of the distinctive character of the city. But Buenos Aires has plenty of character, and remains a city like no other. It is a deceptive place. It appears, at first glance, modern, new-world, hard-edged. But that is only a veneer. Unlike US cities, which look to the future, Buenos Aires is much better at remembering its past. This is essentially a southern European city, often old-fashioned and traditional in outlook. Its inhabitants may move to northern big-city rhythms, but like their Mediterranean forebears they are gregarious, emotional, leisure-loving and sentimental. Buenos Aires spends much of its time recalling its greatest days and, still further back, its European origins. It is not difficult for the visitor, too, to peel back the layers of the years. PorteMos - the city's inhabitants - tell you proudly that in the early part of this century Agentina was one of the leading economies of the world, well ahead of such backwaters as Canada or Australia. Money was no object; anything was possible. There is proof of this even in the commercial downtown district, where, above modern ground-floor facades, are bizarre and ornate follies imitative of long-gone European architectural fads. Nor is Buenos Aires' monumental architecture any more firmly rooted in the new world. Today the grounds around the Palacio del Congresso - Argentina's national congress - are shabby and neglected. Years of economic decline and vast public debt have taken their toll. But it does not take much imagination to see it as it was - bronze and marble statues reminiscent of Rome's, gardens as noble as those of Paris, public architecture as imposing as Madrid's. Still in magnificent condition today is the nine-story Teatro Colon, imported from Europe block by marble block, tile by gilt tile, and regarded as one of the finest opera houses anywhere. My favourite old-world haunt, though, was the tree-lined Avenida de Mayo, designed by Spanish architects in the 19th century. Stroll here with elegantly-dressed crowds on a balmy January summer evening, take coffee in Tortoni's wood-panelled and red-leather-upholstered cafe, and you could not tell that you were not on a boulevard in some elegant southern European city. If PorteMos placed so much importance on things European, it is because they never wholly cut their ties, and remained eternal immigrants on an essentially foreign continent. Between 1860 and 1930 6m Europeans began new lives in Argentina, many settling in Buenos Aires. White, largely urban and imbued with middle-class values, Argentines feel little affinity for the rest of South America, much of it poor, rural and of mixed, mestizo blood. Nor do Bolivians, Brazilians and other South Americans have great affection for Argentines. For many who immigrated - half of them Italian, a third Spanish, others German, French, Portuguese and middle-European Jews - a new life in Buenos Aires was moulded by poverty. It was out of the alienation of displaced working people that much of Buenos Aires culture, including the tango, grew. I did not spend too much time after dark in La Boca, the working-class area down by the old port where Buenos Aires life began for many of the early Italian immigrants. The brothels have gone, knife fights in the bars are less common, and most of the squalid tenement buildings have been pulled down. In the day-time it is a good place to walk to get an idea of the city's beginnings, but at night it is a little rough. But I did spend more time in San Telmo, another working-class district close by. It is becoming slowly gentrified, its warehouses being turned into artists' studios, its once-crowded dwellings converted to antique shops jammed with family treasures - clocks and porcelain, cast bronze and marble, mirrors and wind-up gramophones - imported by later and wealthier generations of PorteMos. But there is still a genuine neighbourhood atmosphere that, for me, brought out the best of the great urban conclave that is Buenos Aires. I toured the markets with local housewives, watched old men in their undershirts playing dominoes under the trees of the Plaza Dorrego, and kicked a ball in the street with a young crew of future Maradonas. In Des Nivel, a simple little restaurant with plastic table-cloths, 10-gallon wine jugs and a vast charcoal grill, I ate thick Argentine steak, the tenderest in the world. Best of all, I found a small place called A Media Luz - In the Half Light. There are not many places left these days where you can watch and listen to tango, the sensual dance, the sad songs that for generations of immigrants were the expression of absence and loss. But the elderly PorteMos gathered in A Media Luz not only knew the music, they remembered the words and sang them with tears in their eyes. For all its modern bustle, Buenos Aires is an evocation of the past.</p>

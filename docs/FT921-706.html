			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Striking lack of reality undermines yesterday's image - The Issues / Union Reform A CONSERVATIVE party election poster shows a mass meeting of workers voting for strike action by a show of hands. The slogan reads: 'Labour in, everybody out. Don't vote for strikes, strikes, and more strikes.' Yesterday the Conservatives tried to make industrial relations an election issue, but the poster describes a state of affairs that no longer exists. The fact is that, after the introduction of secret ballots in 1984, it has been impossible for unions to call strikes on a show of hands. Labour has no plans to change the law. The problem for the Conservatives is one of success. Mrs Margaret Thatcher's union reforms and the quiescent mood of organised labour for the past few years have reduced the impact of the union bogey. Most voters seem aware of Labour's more arm's-length relationship with the unions and acceptance of aspects of the reforms, including abolition of the closed shop, restrictions on picketing, and ballots for strikes and elections. The philosophical gulf between the two main parties remains wide but the debate about employment law and labour market regulation is now more subtle. The Conservatives persist in playing the union card, believing there is still ambivalence about unions and stressing that much has not changed in Labour's union links. For example, pivotal Labour commitments - including the minimum wage and equal rights for part-time workers - are priority policies because of union pressure. The union block vote at Labour conferences is on the way down, and possibly out, but it still counts for 90 per cent of the votes. The Conservative attack has concentrated on those aspects of the Thatcher legacy that Labour would reverse. These include banning ex parte injunctions which can be granted to an employer without the union being represented and stopping employers from creating artificial companies to exploit the law banning secondary action. By concentrating on these arcane aspects of union law, it is possible to lose sight of how radically a Labour government would change industrial relations. Labour does not like much of the labour-market deregulation of the past decade, believing that it increases insecurity and creates only low-pay, low-productivity jobs easily blown away in recession. It recognises that the labour market, and the working class, has changed. There has been a permanent shift to services and to non-manual work which has brought with it a probably permanent decline in union membership and collective bargaining. Labour thus proposes to introduce rights for all employees, in all their new diversity, rather than for unions. It intends to continue dismantling Britain's voluntarist system of industrial relations and replace it with a more continental system in which employees have positive rights to balance the restrictions and deregulation of the Thatcher years. A selection of legislation which could be on the statute book after Labour's first term includes equal rights for part-time workers, employee right to consultation, improvements to the equal-pay laws, better maternity pay - 14 weeks on full pay  - and a law banning age discrimination in employment. Labour's commitment to reverse the government's Maastricht opt-out from an extension of European Community employment law would lead to legislation on working time and works councils for larger companies, and perhaps much more. Conservative deregulation policies, such as the extension of the qualifying period for employment protection from six months to two years, would also be reversed. Labour has a neo-corporatist agenda and here the unions are still important. It wants to reform public-sector pay, although how is not yet clear. It will also try to influence pay-setting more generally through the guidance offered to bargainers in the annual National Economic Assessment. Labour thinkers are sceptical about devolved pay bargaining and want the unions to deliver responsible pay agreements in the hope of a better trade-off between pay and employment. In return, Labour offers not only the positive rights but also a law on union recognition which will require employers to recognise and bargain with unions if more than 50 per cent of a workforce votes for recognition. Most employers are worried by the cost of Labour's plans. Those in low-pay sectors are unhappy about the national minimum wage, and especially its effect on differentials. Conservative plans, which mark no significant departure from their current approach, will be more to their taste. The Tories believe their policies run with the grain of an increasingly flexible, individualistic, white-collar workforce. They say that patterns of industrial relations based on unions and collective bargaining are in decline and that individuals and employers increasingly want to deal with each other directly. They would encourage the trend towards individual contracts, promote performance related pay in the public sector, and may even abolish the wages councils which set a floor for wages in some industries. In spite of the Tories saying in 1990 that their programme of union reform was complete, it has recently been revived. Specific industrial relations pledges include new rules governing the automatic 'check-off' of union dues, removing the power of the Trades Union Congress to regulate which union workers can belong to, seven days' notice of strikes, and postal as opposed to workplace ballots on strikes. The differences between Labour and the Liberal Democrats are less marked than those between Labour and the Conservatives. Some aspects of Labour policy, such as employee involvement and signing up to the Social Charter, would have Liberal Democrat backing. Other policies, such as the minimum wage, would not.</p>

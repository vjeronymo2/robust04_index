			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE BOOK OF FRESH FLOWERS BY MALCOLM HILLIER (SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER; 1988)  </P> <P> THE LOGICAL SUCCESSOR to "The Book of Dried Flowers," which Hillier co-wrote  with Colin Hilton, "Fresh Flowers" is illustrated with stunning photos of  flower arrangements the like of which we hardly ever see at the neighborhood  florist. But what makes this book several cuts above the usual pretty  coffee-table entry are the pages of photos and descriptions of individual  flowers. Because this is a British book, some of the flowers will be  unavailable -- or outrageously expensive -- in Southern California. Of course,  one can always attempt to grow one's own.

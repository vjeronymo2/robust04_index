			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MURDOCH TV UNIT SUES DISNEY FOR $1.5 BILLION;  </P> <P> SKY TELEVISION CLAIMS AGREEMENT FOR SATELLITE VENTURE WAS DERAILED BY UNFAIR  BUSINESS TACTICS  </P> <P> Sky Television, media baron Rupert Murdoch's British TV unit, demanded $1.5  billion from Walt Disney Co. in a lawsuit filed Monday that charged Disney with  breaching its agreement to join the Murdoch company in a satellite TV venture.  </P> <P> The suit accuses Disney of fraud and pits Barry Diller, who heads Fox Inc. and  other Murdoch entertainment ventures, against Disney Chairman Michael Eisner, a  longtime former associate of Diller's at Paramount Pictures.  </P> <P> The complaint, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, claims that Disney used  unfair tactics to derail an agreement under which it was to join the unit of  Murdoch's Australian-based News Corp. in launching two satellite movie channels  in Great Britain this year. It demands $1 billion in punitive damages and $500  million in actual damages.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Four Broadcast Channels  </P> <P> At one point, the complaint says: "While Disney spends millions to create the  appearance that they are honest and wholesome and that the Disney name stands  for such qualities, the fact is that defendants' common pattern and practice is  to ignore and deny their agreements and to use economic leverage to exact  unjustified concessions from those with whom they contract and deal."  </P> <P> Disney spokesman Thomas Deegan read a one-line statement in response to the  suit. It said: "We have great regard for Mr. Murdoch and his accomplishments,  but we are surprised at this suit, which has absolutely no merit."  </P> <P> Sky Television operates four direct broadcast British TV channels over a  satellite that was launched Feb. 5. Last November, Disney agreed to join  Murdoch in operating one of the channels, Sky Movies, as a pay service offering  feature films and in launching the Disney Channel on the satellite.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Available to Defuse Problems'  </P> <P> According to the suit, however, Disney executives failed to provide their share  of funding for the venture, dragged their feet on decisions to force a change  in terms and finally "repudiated" the agreement May 12, despite repeated pleas  by Diller for cooperation from Disney executives.  </P> <P> In an April 28 letter to Eisner and Disney President Frank Wells, a copy of  which was filed with the suit, Diller wrote:  </P> <P> "We have experienced the normal difficulties that one would expect in the case  of a new venture, particularly in a new and ground-breaking business. We  believe, however, these pale to insignificance when measured against the  accomplishments of each of us. . . . To further the process, I offer to make  myself personally available on a 'hotline' basis in order to defuse and resolve  any potential problems that may arise."  </P> <P> According to the complaint, Eisner and Wells never answered the letter.  </P> <P> In its suit, Murdoch's company asks the court to block Disney from selling its  programming in Great Britain until the dispute is resolved. Bertram Fields, an  attorney for Murdoch, said no hearing has been set in the case, which was  assigned to Judge Dion Morrow.  </P> <P> Sky Television, one of several ventures seeking to tap the increasingly  deregulated European television market, has been hampered by the initial  unavailability of its satellite receiving dishes but still aims to reach more  than a million British homes by year-end. Satellite TV is broadcast directly to  a receiver in the viewer's home rather than over cable.  </P> <P> The service has been competing with British Satellite Broadcasting, another  satellite service that expects to begin operation later this year, for packages  of Hollywood films.  </P> <P> BSB secured rights to films from Warner Bros. and MGM/UA, among others, last  year. According to the lawsuit, Sky Television's negotiations with Warner and  other studios have been hampered by Disney's "dilatory behavior" -- which Sky  Television alleged was meant to force a readjustment in terms or cancellation  of the venture.  </P> <P> The suit is the latest in a series of big-money disputes that have rocked the  entertainment business. In other recent actions, Paramount Pictures sued Viacom  for breaching a major pay TV contract, even as the two were said by Wall Street  analysts to be discussing a merger; Viacom sued competitor HBO, in a move that  some observers believed might complicate a pending merger between Warner  Communications and HBO's parent, Time Inc., and MCA locked horns in a Canadian  court battle with Cineplex-Odeon, its partly owned subsidiary.  </P> <P> Diller, as chairman of Paramount, and Eisner, as president, were one of the  most successful teams in the history of movie making before the breakup of  their regime, which produced "Flashdance," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," "Beverly  Hills Cop" and other hits. Diller left to join Twentieth Century Fox Film  Corp., then owned by Marvin Davis, in 1984. Eisner immediately left Paramount  for Disney, and was soon joined by many ex-Paramount executives.  </P></p>

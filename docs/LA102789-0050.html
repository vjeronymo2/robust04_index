			<p><P> October 27, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> 'UNRATED' TAPES RATE HIGH WITH RENTERS  </P> <P> While no theatrical blockbusters show up on this week's new-video schedule,  there's no shortage of movies, including some "scandalous" imports.  </P> <P> The most scandalous new videocassette is, in fact, "Scandal." This 1989 British  film about the 1963 Profumo case was trimmed of some sexy scenes to gain an R  rating in this country. Starring Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, John Hurt, Roland Gift  and Bridget Fonda, "Scandal" is available from HBO in both R-rated (106  minutes) and unrated (115 minutes) versions.  </P> <P> It makes one wonder whether we will be seeing more films submitted to the  Motion Picture Assn. of America with scenes that the producers know will earn  an X rating, dutifully withdrawn and recut to gain an R-rated theatrical  release, then released on video in both versions. Result: publicity for the  film and the video, and a "hot" edge for the unrated, unedited version.  </P> <P> This seems to happening most in the horror field. Latest example: "Leatherface:  The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III," which was resubmitted last week to avoid an X  rating. Wonder what the chances are that the excised violent scenes will show  up in an unrated video version in a few months?  </P> <P> Other films new at your video store:  </P> <P> If you howled at Pedro Almodovar's "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,"  then you might like to rent the Bunuel-influenced Spanish director's offbeat  and even darker 1986 film "Matador" (Cinevista, $79.95, unrated, subtitled),  all about a retired matador and his decidedly strange activities and  acquaintances.  </P> <P> Three years before making her Hollywood debut in "Intermezzo," Ingrid Bergman  starred in the original Swedish version of the touching love story about a  young pianist and the older, married man who falls for her. Directed by Gustav  Molander, this subtitled 1936 "Intermezzo" (Crocus, $79.95) now joins its U.S.  remake on the video shelves.  </P> <P> SVS has three notable, subtitled Japanese films for $59.95 each: Akira  Kurosawa's version of Gorky's grim social drama "The Lower Depths" (1957),  Kenji Mizoguchi's portrait of a Japanese woman, "Osaka Elegy" (1936), and  Hiroshi Teshigahara's "The Face of Another" (1966), which, like the new U.S.  film "Johnny Handsome," concerns a once-disfigured man with a new face.  </P> <P> The 1942 Italian drama "We the Living" (JCI, $79.95, two cassettes) is at least  a curio for its cast (Rossano Brazzi, Alida Valli), its source (an Ayn Rand  novel about love and betrayal in the Soviet Union of the 1920s), and its length  (174 minutes).  </P> <P> "Wonderwall: The Movie" (Studio, $79.95) was an unsuccessful 1968 British  picture that will probably be of most interest now to Beatles fans, since  George Harrison, with a little help from friends such as Eric Clapton and Ravi  Shankar, contributed the score.  </P> <P> This week's smaller domestic crop includes "Leviathan" (MGM/UA, $89.95, R),  which took the "Alien" plot under water with stars Peter Weller and Amanda Pays  but without the craftsmanship of another '89 beneath-the-waves sci-fi film,  "The Abyss"; and "Lost Angels" (Orion, $89.98, R), a Hugh Hudson-directed drama  about a troubled young man, starring Donald Sutherland and Adam Horovitz (of  the Beastie Boys).  </P> <P> OTHER NEW VIDEOS  </P> <P> Fans of that one-of-a-kind 1966-71 afternoon soap opera/horror series "Dark  Shadows" will be happy to know that MPI is offering "The Resurrection of  Barnabas Collins" ($29.95), a two-hour tape featuring an overview of the series  and the first five episodes, and the "Dark Shadows Three-Pack," three cassettes  containing five episodes each sold as a set only ($79.95).

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ferronickel producer halts second furnace CERRO MATOSO, one of the world's top ferronickel producers, has frozen plans to build a second furnace at its Colombian refinery because of low world prices, rising production costs and a government proposal to increase royalties, reports Reuter from Bogota. Mr German del Corral, president of the company, which is 52.3 per cent owned by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said the company decided to suspend the Dollars 600m project early this month. He explained the decision to suspend the project, which would have nearly doubled production and made it the world's second largest producer of the material, was made after the Ministry of Mines reopened negotiations on royalties and proposed a higher rate. He said the proposal, which would fix the rate at 15 per cent, rather than gradually increase it from 8 to 16 per cent as output rose, was the last of a combination of factors that rendered the project unfeasible. 'There were many negative factors,' he said, citing higher taxes, rising production costs and a widening gap between local inflation and the devaluation of the peso. The world market price of nickel was also a factor, he added. At Dollars 2.70 a lb, it was not worth going ahead with the project.</p>

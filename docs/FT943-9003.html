			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Directors' transactions Directors at Seton Healthcare have been selling to improve liquidity in their stock. This happens quite often in companies where the shares are held tightly but there is strong institutional demand for equity. By keeping the stock too tightly, a false market can be created. To avoid this, corporate brokers may advise a release of some shares. Brandon Hire is involved in leasing all kinds of equipment including marquees, furniture and power tools. It has been quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market since late 1989 but, in the next few months, expects to get a full stock market listing. In order to satisfy the criteria required for this, chairman Brian Nathan and managing director Richard Bryan have sold stock to diminish their personal stakes. Other members of the board took the opportunity to acquire shares. Barry Charles, chief executive of electronics company Electron House, sold stock worth more than Pounds 161,000 during the week to fund the purchase of a house. He retains 40,000 shares.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- DIRECTORS' SHARE TRANSACTIONS IN THEIR OWN COMPANIES (LISTED &amp; USM)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             No of Company                Sector       Shares     Value    directors  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- SALES Amersham Intnl         Hlth         60,000       621          1* Asprey                 RetG         10,000        31          1 Brandon                BCon        750,000       480          2 Daily Mail 'A' N/V     Mdia         30,000       304          1 Electron House         Dist        105,000       162          1 Johnson Fry            OthF         45,159        83          1 Leigh Interests        OS&amp;B         25,000        55          1 Martin Shelton         OS&amp;B         10,000        10          1 MEPC                   Prop         18,006        84          1* Rank Organisation      L&amp;Hl          3,439        14          1 Seton Health Care      Hlth        233,705         1          6 Vibroplant             BCon         25,000        25          1 VTR                    Mdia        100,000       130          1  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PURCHASES Ashtead                BCon          8,000        31          1 Brandon                BCon         30,000        19          3 Excalibur Group        Eng          50,000        21          1 Filofax                OS&amp;B         30,000        61          1 Hampson Inds.

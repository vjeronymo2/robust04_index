Zhu Kaixuan, minister of the State Education Commission,  said  at a national education telephone meeting here today that the  plan is based on an evaluation of the total financial need in  education during 1993-2000.    He said that his commission has discussed with the Finance  Ministry about issues of collecting education taxes from social  services and exempting taxes on school-run factories, which will  fall in line with finance reform this year.    Insufficient education funding, which has dogged China's  educational progress for years, remains one of the major  problems. Another problem is low teacher pay.    Zhu said that China will set up an education trust and  investment company as well as an education development fund  shortly, in an effort to solve these problems. Meanwhile, an  evaluation system will be established to monitor and prevent  misappropriation of teaching money.    "The proportion of education investment prescribed in the  state budget must see an obvious increase," he urged, also  stressing the establishment and increase of a special allocation  at the central and local financial levels for supporting  compulsory education.    He called on provincial governments and central ministries  to  determine suitable standards for school tuition fees, which are  now too freely set.    "We will study the idea to let education departments join  the  education budget-making process in the relevant governments,  improve the policy to collect money for developing rural  education, and build a mechanism to finance the building of  classrooms," he said.    As to raising teachers' salaries, he noted that a reform  will  soon be proposed by the Education Commission and the Personnel  Ministry. And severe punishments will be imposed on those who  delay paying teachers' salaries.</p>

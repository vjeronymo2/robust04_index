			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Collection of Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Paperwork Reduction Act [44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.], the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviews each rule that contains a collection-of-information requirement, to determine whether the practical value of the information is worth the burden imposed by its collection. Collection-of-information requirements include reporting, recordkeeping, notification, and other, similar requirements. This rule will clarify the reporting of marine casualties to include unintentional strikes of bridges. However, when it has met the additional criteria found in 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1, this type of casualty has always been included in the category of ``other'' casualties listed on the form. A CG&hyph;2692 (OMB No. 2115&hyph;0003) will still be the form used. Persons submitting comments on the requirements should submit their comments both to OMB and to the Coast Guard where indicated under  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Federalism <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Coast Guard has analyzed this interim rule under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not have sufficient implications for federalism to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Environment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this interim rule and has concluded that, under &sect;2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this rule is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This rule is an administrative matter within the meaning of sub-&sect;2.B.2.1 of that instruction that clearly has no environmental impact. (It requires the reporting of marine casualties and the reporting of most strikes of bridges.) A ``Determination of Categorical Exclusion'' is available in the docket for inspection or copying where indicated under ADDRESSES. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> List of Subjects in 46 CFR Part 4 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Investigations, Marine safety, National Transportation Safety Board, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Safety, and Transportation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble, the Coast Guard amends 46 CFR Part 4 as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=72 g=1 f=2 --> TITLE 46&blank;[AMENDED] <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=2 --> PART 4_MARINE CASUALTIES AND INVESTIGATIONS <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> 1.

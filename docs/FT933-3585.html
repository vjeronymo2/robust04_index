			<p>930913 FT  13 SEP 93 / Canadian utility faces part sell-off ONTARIO Hydro, one of North America's biggest power utilities and one of the largest borrowers in the Eurobond market, is laying the groundwork for a partial privatisation to help ease its acute financial condition. The Toronto-based utility at present relies entirely on debt financing, and has amassed borrowings of more than CDollars 34bn (Pounds 16.7bn). 'We simply cannot any longer tolerate 100 per cent debt financing, we simply do not have enough equity,' said Mr Maurice Strong, chairman. Mr Strong said that Hydro, which is owned by the Ontario provincial government, is preparing a financial restructuring which will include 'very fundamental changes'. He indicated that these may include opening the door to outside equity participation. The province's left-of-centre New Democratic government has up to now been reluctant to endorse private ownership of Hydro. However, Mr Strong said that 'the issue isn't privatisation; the issue is financial flexibility'. Mr Strong, who organised last year's United Nations Earth Summit, has launched a far-reaching shake-up at Hydro since he took over as chairman last December. As part of an austerity plan announced earlier this year, the utility has set a goal of reducing borrowings by a third over the next decade, and trimming its debt-equity ratio from the present 83:17 to about 60:40. It has chopped its capital spending budget, and is also cutting 6,000 of its 29,000 jobs, and splitting its operations into three separate business units. Hydro expects to suffer a loss of at least CDollars 1.6bn this year, including an operating loss of about CDollars 200m. It cited slack demand for electricity, write-offs related to restructuring, and continuing problems at a nuclear power station. The shake-up is a response to growing concern among electricity users at the steep hike in rates, which has averaged 7.3 per cent a year since 1988. Cheap power has in the past been one of the chief drawcards for investors in Ontario. Mr Strong has pledged to freeze Hydro's rates next year, and to hold increases for the rest of the 1990s no higher than Canada's inflation rate.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR COINS: SEVERAL FACTORS CAN AFFECT THE PRICE OF DUTCH GOLD DUCAT  </P> <P> Question: I recently received a pamphlet from the Dutch Mint for the reissue of  the double ducat, last issued in 1867. The price is $185. The coin is of .983  fine gold and weighs 6.988 grams. With gold at $404.75 per ounce, if you divide  that price by 31.1 grams per ounce you get $13.014 per gram times the 6.988  grams the coin weighs. That equals $90.95 plus a $20 handling charge.  Therefore, the coin shouldn't cost more than $120. My question is: Does the  rarity warrant the price they are charging? Is its numismatic value that high  the moment it is struck? -- A.G.K.  </P> <P> Answer: There are several factors involved in your question. The price of gold  was quite low when you did your math, but you have the right idea. However,  there are production and promotion costs that must be figured into the final  price. Also, purchasers are speculating that such coins, which are essentially  bullion pieces, will go up in value because of the low mintage. Sometimes they  do and sometimes they don't.  </P> <P> I've always maintained that if you like the coin and can afford it, buy it. If  your intention is to make a profit, be very selective and cautious. Some modern  issues do very well; others don't. Bullion pieces will always have their  intrinsic value. It's the collector value that is unpredictable.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin News  </P> <P> Traditionally, the numismatic season kicks off each year with the FUN show in  Orlando, Fla. This year's show, today through Sunday, will feature a souvenir  card (pictured) from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. It is the third in  the American Heritage series and depicts a replica of a $50 Treasury note,  series of 1891. Only 25 pieces of this note are still reported as outstanding  on Treasury books. Mail-order souvenir cards (No. 966) are $5.50; those postal  cancelled (No. 967) are $5.75. Order from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing,  Mail-Order Sales, Room 602-11A, 14th and C streets S.W., Washington, D.C.  20228.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Coin Calendar  </P> <P> Saturday and Sunday -- Coins, stamps, baseball cards, jewelry and all matter of  collectibles will be featured at the semi-annual Pasadena Pavilion Coin and  Stamp Exposition.

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / World Trade News: Making the telephones work in Russia - Efforts to bring order to the market free-for-all of initial telecoms reform Russia is due to offer 22 per cent of Rostelekom, its telecommunications giant, to Russian and foreign investors next week in the latest evidence of the change shaking up its telecommunications sector. Rostelekom, which controls much of Russia's international traffic and practically all long-distance domestic traffic, is embroiled in a bitter debate over how much of a monopoly it should be allowed to restore after disenchantment in some quarters with a market free-for-all. Feverish, if piecemeal, foreign investment has meant the creation over the last few years of dozens of joint ventures with foreign companies and the provision of a range of services, at least for hard-currency paying clients, which simply did not exist before. The result is that making an international telephone call in Moscow has become easy rather than almost impossible - as it was under the old communist system, which discouraged free communication between its own citizens and between itself and the outside world. The new investment plans have ranged from a grand international project to build a fibre optic cable network snaking across the Russian Federation from Denmark in the west to South Korea in the east - vastly expanding the number of international telephone lines available to ordinary Russian citizens - to a private telecommunications system using cables in the Moscow metro. Mr Edouard Altenhoven, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's team leader for telecommunications, says that until the Russian authorities can come up with a clear vision of where they want to go, 'there's a good case to be made for chaos'. Chaotic development has at least brought some real improvements in service, which cannot be said about Belarus, for instance, which has only one foreign joint venture and little to show for it. To combat some of the chaos, the Russian telecommunications ministry recently signalled a change in its policies over mobile telephones. It threatened to deprive operators of licences unless they implemented their terms on deadline and it is insisting on compatibility between regional systems. 'This is the first clever idea and the first step towards civilisation in three years,' said one Russian telecommunications expert who is an ardent supporter of market reforms. But he said that the chaotic, and sometimes corrupt, distribution of 70 licences around Russia to dozens of foreign companies - many of which either just sat on their licences or planned to build networks which were incompatible with each other - was leading to 'disaster'. The main challenge is to find ways of financing the upgrading of less profitable local infrastructure in a country where it is still impossible in some places to make a local call. Rostelekom, together with a number of western companies, is working to finalise a Dollars 1bn project known as '50 times 50' to link 50 Russian cities with 50,000km of fibre-optic cable. The American telecommunications company US West has launched a financial vehicle, the Russian Telecommunications Development Corporation, into which it and other investors plan to reinvest profits and through which they hope to raise more capital. Mr Stan Cramton, of US West in Moscow, believes Russia should have a telecommunications monopoly to 'cross-subsidise' the less glamorous services with revenues from the more profitable international traffic. 'There isn't a single country in the world which did not develop its telephone infrastructure on the basis of a monopoly,' he said. He admitted that a monopoly would benefit large companies such as his which are accustomed to working long-term and want certainty about the future. Mr Gordon Muir-Carby, responsible for emerging markets at London stockbrokers Smith New Court, says there will be some institutional interest in the Rostelekom offering. 'People have determined that at least in telecoms and consumer industries things will reach rock bottom this year but then pick up,' he said. But although many would consider any risk would be discounted in the low stock price, he believed that others would be put off by the lack of transparency in a company such as Rostelekom. According to many western executives, there is a need for local telephone services to reflect more closely their true cost. But Russians warn that this would be politically difficult in a nation used to talking on the telephone for free, or close to it.</p>

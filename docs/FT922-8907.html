			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Observer: New Scotsmen Lonrho's Tiny Rowland deserves to be congratulated for selling George Outram to the existing management. The ownership of Scotland's top newspaper, the Glasgow Herald, is back where it belongs - in Scotland. The price - around 20 times earnings - sounds a lot, but Lonrho is selling a quality asset at the bottom of a recession, and a couple of years from now, Outram's profits could easily have doubled. Lonrho could probably have got more for Outram if it had auctioned it more aggressively. But then the Scots wouldn't own it. Now that Scotland has regained ownership of one of its national assets, it will be interesting to see whether the real control passes into the hands of Edinburgh's financial mafia, or whether Outram's new owners will demonstrate a more independent streak. If The Independent can pick German-born Sir Ralf Dahrendorf as its chairman, surely the new team at George Outram doesn't have to insist on having a Scotsman as chairman.</p>

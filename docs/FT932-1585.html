			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Jobs: Self-imposed stranglehold on recovery - A do-it-yourself guide to how understanding things differs from being able to do them OUT of the shadows of a dark empty street springs a hulking man. Wrapping his fingers round your throat and giving you no chance to knee him, he presses both thumbs on your Adam's Apple and starts throttling the life out of you. What do you do to stop him? Although some readers will no doubt know the answer, if you're anything like the people to whom the Jobs column demonstrated it at a conference not long ago, most of you will not. The object of my demo was to clarify the difference between two broad kinds of knowledge. One is the academic sort forming the main stock in trade of higher education at universities and so on. The other is the type essential to the doing of almost all skilled work. The fact that the difference exists is crucial, especially in Britain. For it seems clear that unless we improve our stock of work skills, we shall be unable to keep up our present standard of living. And one costly service at risk to economic faltering is our network of higher educational institutions which, however else they may benefit the community, aren't earning their own keep. How expensive they are was illustrated by the Labour shadow education minister Jeff Rooker at a Lancaster University seminar last week. He said his inquiries showed that the average yearly cost of nursery schooling to the taxpayer was Pounds 1,400 a head, rising to Pounds 2,200 in secondary schooling, and Pounds 2,700 in college courses not leading to degrees. At university undergraduate level the averages leapt to between Pounds 6,000 and Pounds 9,000 depending on subject studied, and at Oxford and Cambridge in particular to Pounds 8,000-Pounds 11,000. Anyone doubting that higher education is failing to cover its costs should read a study by the seminar's organiser, Lancaster's Jim Murphy, in the latest Oxford Review of Education. One thing he does is to take apart various reports that have tried to justify further expansion of higher education on grounds that Britain provides less of it than do certain countries which are better off. He shows that, whatever may account for the wealth of nations, it is not their provision of post-school courses. Dr Murphy also rebuts claims that more people with degree-level education are needed by companies. He points out that, even before the recession, the British government's Highly Qualified People survey found that 'a degree was considered essential for only a third of the jobs' for which companies had recruited new graduates. In the other two thirds of cases, the employers said the work could be done just as well by 18-year-old recruits who had left education after the Advanced level exams, and been given relevant work experience and training. Such findings do not deny that most graduates are personally enriched by the intellectual stimulus of degree studies. The snag is that unless the personally enriching activity also pays for itself - which the figures suggest it doesn't - it is a drain on the economy. As Jim Murphy puts it, the idea that intellectual energy converts into national prosperity looks to be mistaken. The question why that is so brings us back to you readers standing in the dark street being throttled - unless, of course, you've already expired in the interval. For, to my mind at any rate, the explanation lies in the difference between the sort of knowledge that's the stock in trade of higher education, and the kind which practical skills essentially depend on. The academic sort consists of two main elements. One is quasi-factual knowledge: knowing that something is so. The second is scientific-style explanations of certain phenomena: knowing why they are so. But work skills are based on know-how, which is more complex. For one thing, the academic elements are easier to teach, as I hope to illustrate with reference to the throttler. First comes a know-that: what it is that you can do to stop him, virtually regardless of how much bigger than you he may be. Put the palm of one hand flat on his chest and, whichever hand you use, slide forward the foot on the same side of your body. Then push, sharply swivelling your shoulders and hips sideways, as though your hand on his chest were holding an archer's bow and you were drawing it with the other. No matter how hard he tries to hang on, he'll have to let go. If you don't believe me, test it with colleagues. Having taught you that you can stop a throttler in that way, I'll explain why it works. His grip depends on just the power of his hands and shoulders. Against that, while it may seem that you're using only one arm, you are in fact opposing the force of most of your body from the big toe of the front foot upwards. The only trouble is that, even though you now know both that and why, if you're ever seized in a throttle for real by someone much bigger, it's odds on you'll die. Or, at least, that is the lesson of my experience. The instructor who taught me the technique was scientifically minded. After demonstrating and explaining it, he had me practise it on him 50 times with either hand. Then minutes later he suddenly grabbed me and began throttling in earnest. After the second or so it took to realise what was happening, I fought for my life, tearing at his arms and trying to knee and kick him. The only thing I didn't try was the push technique. Once I went limp, he let go. 'Wasn't that interesting?', he said as I crawled off to vomit. He was right. It had shown me the difference between know-that and know-why on the one hand, and know-how on the other. The distinction is scarcely a new discovery. Aristotle pointed it out some 2,300 years ago. He wrote that absorbing knowledge intellectually is not enough to make it usable. To become readily convertible into skilful action, it 'must be worked into the living texture of the mind'* And while he didn't specifically say so, the inference is that the only way to gain such skills is by diligent practice in conditions that are increasingly real. But although his advice has been available for two millennia, the British in particular seem lately to have ignored it. For our *Ethics VII 1147a. Penguin 1955. 30 years of repeated expansion of higher academic studies has been accompanied by the discarding of a learning method more like the one Aristotle looks to have had in mind: apprenticeship. All of which would appear to leave any government seriously interested in economic advance with a choice. Either universities and the like must themselves learn to impart productive know-how to their students in much greater measure. Or much of the higher educational structure must be scrapped and replaced with apprentice-style learning. Either way, however, it would be foolish to expect the result to be less expensive - far from it. Indeed, one of the arguments for expanding the educational network was that a given number of students could be put through its courses far more cheaply than through the apprentice training that went before. Hence any return to a know-how emphasis in learning will inevitably mean a still heavier bill. But it would surely be better to put more money into a process which contributes to national prosperity than maintain today's level of spending on a cost.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A NEW PAINTING -- AND A NEW PAINT JOB -- AT ART MUSEUM  </P> <P> The opening today of four newly painted and reinstalled galleries at the County  Museum of Art makes all the artworks look like brand-new acquisitions, but one  painting is the real thing. "St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the  Father at La Storta," an Italian Baroque altarpiece by Domenichino, is a recent  gift of the Ahmanson Foundation. The glowing devotional painting, depicting a  saint at a spellbound moment, goes on view today in the museum's 17th-Century  gallery.  </P> <P> As a matter of policy, the museum does not disclose prices of new acquisitions,  but the Domenichino is a rare and beautiful work that many institutions would  like to have, according to Philip Conisbee, curator of European paintings and  sculpture.  </P> <P> "There has been a great deal of eyebrow raising in the museum world" over  LACMA's good fortune in landing the picture, museum director Earl A. Powell  said.  </P> <P> Though not well known and not in fashion, Domenichino's stock is rising. "He  has been rediscovered in the last 20 years as part of a scholarly  re-examination of Italian Baroque painting," Conisbee said. This particular  canvas, which has been in private European collections and was purchased with  Ahmanson funds from a London dealer, came to light in the early '80s -- just in  time to be included in the appendix of Richard Spear's monograph on the artist.  </P> <P> The richly colored altarpiece was commissioned for the Church of Gesu in Rome  by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in about 1622, the year St. Ignatius Loyola was  canonized. The painting hung in the church for awhile but was removed during  Domenichino's lifetime and replaced with a copy made in his studio. Scholars  believe that the original was privately sold, but records are incomplete.  </P> <P> "St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the Father at La Storta"  portrays a priest on a journey in 1537 to Rome where he planned to seek papal  approval of the new religious order of Jesuits. At La Storta, 10 miles  northwest of Rome, the priest had a vision of the holy father and son in which  Christ declared, "I shall be merciful to thee in Rome."  </P> <P> Domenichino has portrayed this episode in the priest's life as a moment of  divine inspiration. The rapt priest, on his knees, looks up to the heavens  where he sees God in human form, Christ holding and pointing to a cross (the  symbol of the Jesuits) and angels. The congregation appears to float in a  profusion of golden clouds that are composed of cherubic faces.  </P> <P> Domenichino (1581-1641) was born Domenico Zampieri in Bologna. He was the  favorite pupil of Annibale Carracci and a friend and rival of painter Guido  Reni, two of whose works are owned by LACMA. They are currently in a traveling  exhibition, but, upon their return, the museum will display them with the  Domenichino and two earlier Ahmanson gifts, Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With  the Smoking Flame" and Philippe de Champaigne's "St. Augustine."  </P> <P> Domenichino, who painted in a more classical style than Reni, is primarily  known for frescoes on buildings in Rome and Naples. He did relatively few easel  paintings. "There are maybe a dozen in the world," Conisbee said. "St.  Ignatius" is a fine example because of its "classical perfection of form" and  pristine condition. "Every brush mark is from Domenichino's hand," the curator  said, noting that the painting had been properly cared for and not repainted by  restorers.  </P> <P> Three other refurbished galleries opening today display the museum's  collections of 18th-Century art (including the recently acquired "Portrait of  the Devin Family" by Louis-Michel van Loo), 19th-Century paintings and  sculpture and works by the French Romantics.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> USE OF PENDLETON WATER TABLE STUDIED  </P> <P> Negotiations have begun to allow San Clemente to tap a vast water table beneath  Camp Pendleton, a reservoir that could increase the city's water supply at  least sevenfold.  </P> <P> Last week, the Tri-Cities Water District board of directors voted to explore  the possibility of using the 300-million-gallon water table as an emergency  storage area. The reservoir would serve a major portion of the South County,  including San Clemente, Capistrano Beach, parts of Dana Point and the San  Onofre Nuclear Power Station.  </P> <P> Authorities plan to begin a $270,000 project to test the so-called San Mateo  water basin for impurities, said Ray Woodside, district general manager.  </P> <P> "It would be a big security blanket," Woodside said. "This would be a major  step if we could generate this reserve."  </P> <P> The Tri-Cities Water District has reached agreements with the Metropolitan  Water District and Capistrano Beach County Water District and a tentative  agreement with the city of San Clemente about sharing costs of tests.  </P> <P> If the tests find no major contaminants, that consortium will continue  negotiating with the U.S. Marines for a million-dollar project to drill wells  on Camp Pendleton and install water lines between the camp and the South  County, Woodside said. Water would be purchased from the Metropolitan Water  District, as it is now, and stored in the basin.  </P> <P> "If feasible, we could store water in the San Mateo basin to be used during  peak periods of water use," he said, "or emergencies like a broken water line."  </P> <P> Woodside said finding a site for an above-ground reservoir is difficult.  </P> <P> "Water storage is very expensive," he said. "The cost of land is high, and then  you have to pay for building a structure to hold the water." Underground  reservoirs "don't have that problem."  </P> <P> Last year, the water level in the district's 48-million-gallon reservoir sank  to an all-time low of 17 million gallons on Aug. 18.  </P> <P> Through a series of tough water-saving measures enacted by San Clemente, the  district's largest customer, the reservoir levels have remained higher than  last year.  </P> <P> On Monday, the reservoir held 42 million gallons, Woodside said.  </P> <P> Greg Morehead, water supervisor for San Clemente, said the underground  reservoir would provide the city "a substantial supply of new water. It would  make things a lot more comfortable" during drought conditions.  </P> <P> Builders are not permitted to use water for grading until Sept. 15; residential  lawn watering is restricted during the day.  </P> <P> Warnings have been issued but nobody has been cited for breaking the water law,  Morehead said.

			<p>931221 FT  21 DEC 93 / International Capital Markets: Gloom lifts Tokyo bonds - Yields are at six-year lows Mounting gloom over the Japanese economy, poor corporate earnings, a weak stock market, and a high yen have contributed to active buying of the Japanese bond market this year, pushing long bond yields down to six-year lows. Although the strengthening of the yen seems to have ran its course, a further deterioration of the economy is likely to continue to support the bond market rally. Some analysts predict the yield on the No 157 benchmark bond will fall below 2.55 per cent, a record low reached in 1987. The 10-year bond rallied at the start of the year, but suffered a brief relapse in April and May, as hopes of an imminent economic recovery were raised by good economic figures. However, the increases in output and sales were a result of window dressing ahead of the March fiscal year end, and the bond market resumed its rally in June. The announcement by the coalition government of a Y6,150bn spending package and a cut in the official discount rate to a record low of 1.75 per cent in September failed to lift confidence. While some institutional investors, wary of high prices in the bond market, started to take profits, the chronic weakness of the stock market has kept many investors from liquidating their holdings. Fears over the worsening economy and lower corporate profits pushed the Tokyo stock market to a year's low last month, prompting the Bank of Japan to increase liquidity in the money markets. The rise in demand for bonds has been partly due to the popularity of money management funds, offered by brokers as a relatively safe product which invests in short-term money market and corpo-rate and government bonds. The outstanding balance of MMFs, which offer higher yields than bank deposits, rose above the Y10,000bn mark in October, as retail and corporate investors shifted from bank deposits to MMFs. Large purchases of 20-year government bonds by US hedge funds, betting on a flattening of the yield curve, have led to lower long-term interest rates. Many fund managers saw the 20-year bonds, which in the past have experienced little activity, as underpriced compared to 10-year bonds. On the corporate bond market, an increasing number of companies raised funds, attracted by the low interest rates. Japanese companies raised Y3,024bn during the first 10 months of the year, up 19.2 per cent from the same period last year. An easing of eligibility restrictions also helped lift issuance. Lower underwriting costs due to increased competition has helped. The entry of bank subsidiaries into the underwriting business has led to aggressive discounting of underwriting fees. For example, the Big Four brokers, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko, and Yamaichi, recently resigned from the underwriting syndication for Kobe Steel bonds in protest at the discounts offered by the bank affiliated houses. However, the illiquid secondary market is still causing inefficient pricing, including the lack of price differentiation according to credit ratings. This has affected Japan's samurai bond market for foreign borrowers. Since cost differences between issuers with high credit ratings and low ratings are smaller than in other markets, issuers with triple-A ratings opt for the Eurobond market, while issuers with low credit ratings have piled in. 'Japan's samurai market is turning into a junk bond market,' laments an analyst. In the coming year, analysts expect yields in the government bond market to be supported by bad news on the economy. Mr Kazuo Tamayama, director at Yasuda Kasai Brinson Investment Management, points out that consumption will be the key to bond market movements. The recent trend among Japanese consumers to buy products at discount prices points to lower corporate profit margins. 'Consumers taking the leadership role in determining prices means a further fall in corporate earnings and lower interest rates,' he says. Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo, is bullish about bonds and expects the 10-year benchmark to breach 2.55 per cent. Ms Tomoko Fujii, economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, is more conservative. She expects bond prices to peak in February, and predicts a shift of sentiment after a cut in the official discount rate around February or March. This is the first in a series of articles on aspects of the international capital markets, examining the prospects for next year and looking back at 1993.</p>

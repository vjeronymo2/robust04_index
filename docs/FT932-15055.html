			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / UK Company News: Alexandra in the black with Pounds 1.7m ALEXANDRA Workwear, a manufacturer and distributor of work clothes, yesterday announced a return to profits for the year to January 30 1993, reporting Pounds 1.7m before tax against losses of Pounds 500,000 previously. The comparison is, however, distorted by a Pounds 1.5m exceptional provision last time resulting from the closure of a factory in Scotland and associated redundancies. Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman, said: 'The group's strategy for the year was to significantly improve its balance sheet and restore profitability. We were successful in both in the past year.' Borrowings were reduced to Pounds 10.1m (Pounds 16m) cutting gearing from 73 to 46 per cent, and the company believes its debt will be halved by the next year end. Interest charges fell from Pounds 2.6m to Pounds 1.7m. The high level of stock was reduced to Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 16.6m), with a further Pounds 2m of cuts planned for the current year. Stock turnover was about four months. Mr Dennis said past investment in a computer meant the company would meet customers orders should demand pick up suddenly. One analyst said that 'the company outperformed during the 1980s but when demand fell it didn't take control of its stock levels. This is evidence that it is repairing that damage and that they are back on track.' Turnover was virtually flat at Pounds 57m (Pounds 57.2m). Mr Dennis said that during the first half it had sold 'selected' goods at less-than-profitable prices to keep its factories occupied and prevent redundancies. This had reduced operating profits by about Pounds 900,000 and affected gross margins, which fell to 42.4 per cent (43.9 per cent). New 'stylishly personalised' merchandise had given the retail operations a fillip. Sales in France advanced 12 per cent and overseas sales were up 3.8 per cent at Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 5.3m) in total. A recommended final dividend of 2p gives a total for the year of 3.8p (3.6p), payable from earnings per share of 3.5p against losses of 0.8p.</p>

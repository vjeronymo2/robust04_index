			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / Beckett challenge may split Labour THE THREAT of a return to a bitter schism within the Labour party emerged last night after Mrs Margaret Beckett, the shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, reversed her earlier refusal to contest the deputy leadership. Her candidacy looks set to command strong support and has fuelled controversy over the role of the trade unions. Others candidates in the four-horse race who opened their campaigns yesterday are Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, and Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow development minister. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, so far the only challenger to Mr John Smith for the leadership, is also contesting the deputy's post. Mrs Beckett's decision to run - seen alongside the decision of Mr Tony Blair and Mr Gordon Brown to step aside - has fuelled charges from opponents that both contests are increasingly looking like a 'stitch-up'. With Mr Smith the odds-on favourite for the leadership, backed by the leaders of the biggest unions, challengers say a victory for the shadow chancellor and the woman with whom he has worked closely for three years will lead to bitterness and division within the party. A member of the Gould team said: 'It is clear there have been behind-the-scenes negotiations which are not healthy for party unity or democracy. The joint candidacy (of Mr Smith and Mrs Beckett) would appear to lack any vision for the future and represents only the 'one-more-heave' view of what Labour should do after the election defeat.' Such charges have thrown Mr Smith and Mrs Beckett's camps on the defensive with both insisting that there was no such thing as a Smith-Beckett 'dream ticket.' Mrs Beckett also made a point of insisting yesterday that while she supported Mr Smith for the leadership she had neither sought nor received his endorsement as deputy. However, aides close to Mr Brown and Mr Blair, respectively the trade and industry and employment spokesmen, and both supporters of Mr Smith, confirmed they had agreed to allow Mrs Beckett a clear run. The hard-left Campaign group will meet next week to discuss whether to put up Mr Ken Livingstone, the MP for Brent East, as a candidate.</p>

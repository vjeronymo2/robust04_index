			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Shaik Osman Majid] </F>   [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Thurs -- Bank Negara [Central Bank]  Governor Tan Sri Jaffar Hussein today admitted mistakes were  made by the Central Bank in foreign exchange dealings that  resulted in a loss of RM [Ringgit Malaysia] 5.7 billion over the  past year.    "For the losses I take ful] responsibility. It is the most  honourable thing to do," he said in a press conference here  after presenting the Bank Negara Annual Report 1993.    Asked if in accepting responsibility he will resign Jaffar  said: "If there is a move in that direction, you (the media)  will be the third to know after the Prime Minister and the  Finance Minister."    He also said: "Others down the line will also be held  accountable, some have already resigned."    Asked to explain the absence of Nor Mohamed Yakcop, adviser  and the man in charge of the foreign exchange dealings, at this  year's press conference, Jaffar said: "He has gone on long  leave."    The Governor made it clear that "there was no fraud" in the  loss suffered by the Central Bank.    Despite a total loss of RM6.4 billion, including a loss of  RM700 million in its ordinary operations, the Central Bank's  balance sheet remained strong and the national financial  strength was not affected.    Total assets of the Central Bank increased by 68 per cent to  exceed, for the first time, RM100 billion at the end of 1993.    Foreign reserves increased sharply over the last year to  RM76.4 billion which is sufficient to finance about eight months  of retained imports and 1 1/2 times the size of the country's  external debt.    Equally impressive was the growth of the economy. Gross  Domestic Product [GDP] grew by 8.5 per cent which means an  average growth rate of almost nine per cent for the last six  years.    The buoyant growth was achieved on the back of an inflation  rate below four per cent.    The Consumer Price Index [CPI] moderated to 3.6 per cent,  compared to 4.7 per cent in 1992.    The forecast for 1994 is a high 8.4 per cent GDP growth  provided costs, especially wages, can be controlled.    He said the Central Bank took forward positions in  currencies  like the US dollar, deutschmark, and the yen. The rates,  however, did not move as anticipated by the bank, causing it to  suffer losses.    This is the second year the Central Bank has incurred losses  in the foreign exchange market. It lost RM9 billion in 1992  though it was described as "loss on paper".    "The Central Bank has to deal in foreign exchange be cause  of  the need to maintain liquidity in other currencies for trade  purposes,' he said.    "In hindsight it is apparent that we made the wrong  decisions  (buying into forward or long-term positions) but we had to act  the way we did. If we did not take any action the loss might  have been even more than RM5.7 billion.    "The loss will be written off against the Central Bank's  future profits," he said, admitting that "it would take time."    The Central Bank will continue to deal in foreign exchange  but "only at spot prices" that is buying and selling as and when  the need for that particular currency arises.    Jaffar said the prospect of strong economic growth this year  was bright.    If Malaysian businessmen continue to maintain and hopefully  improve their competitive edge and consumers spend wisely  Malaysians could easily look forward to yet another year of  rapid growth exceeding eight per cent," Jaffar said in his  introductory remarks.    Despite the inflationary pressures of the first month of  1994  when seasonal and festive consumer spending prodded the CPI by  four per cent, Jaffar said the Government will put into place  measures to ensure that inflation does not move beyond four per  cent this year.    The manufacturing sector has been the main source of  economic  growth for the past seven years, contributing no less than 30.1  per cent to the GDP in 1993. Indeed it will continue to be the  Iynchpin of the economy.    The Federal Government achieved a remarkable financial  performance last year when it recorded its first overall budget  surplus since 1960.    The local stock market saw a record-breaking performance in  terms of prices, turnover and market capitalisation.    Trading on the Kuala Stock Exchange [KLSE] in 1593 alone  exceeded the amount of total trade undertaken during the past 20  years in terms of both turnover (107.8 billion units) and value  (RM387.3 billion). From 1973 to 1992, the total volume  recorded on the KLSE was a mere 82 million units valued at RM197  million.    In 1993, the KLSE emerged as the largest bourse in Asean and  the fourth largest in Asia in terms of market capitalisation  after Tokyo, Osaka and Hong Kong.    The bank system displayed the best performance on record  last  year, with pre-tax profit of the banks reaching almost RM4  billion.</p>

			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Spring Ram The amazing saga of Spring Ram's disappearing profits shows just how supple the phrase 'true and fair view' can be. The largest restatement of Spring Ram's figures relates to the unaudited first half figures for 1992. Nonetheless the adoption of different accounting policies by the level-headed new board has lowered 1992's audited full year figures by some 20 per cent. Some of the previous policies accepted by the auditors Arthur Andersen - most notably the depreciation rates which were related to the degree of use of the factories - border on the bizarre. And auditors who are being pressed too hard by managements to accept aggressive accounting techniques can always resign. Some lessons are easily drawn. The abuse of half year figures suggests they should be subject to some kind of scrutiny. Perhaps audit partners should be rotated more rapidly so that a fresh pair of eyes is always on the job. Non-executive directors, significantly absent in Spring Ram's case, are a useful conduit through which auditors can express any qualms. Whatever the accounting worries this was at least a partial victory for corporate governance. The campaign led by the Prudential deserves applause since it may have rescued a viable business before it slumped into irretrievable financial problems. Underlying it all, though, remains the fear that published accounts offer very little defence if a company is determined to see life through a rose-coloured profit and loss account.</p>

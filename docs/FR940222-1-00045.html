			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> 3. We also propose to remove, as outdated, the following sections and paragraphs that were applicable to contract periods that began before January 1, 1986, and to realign the designation schemes as necessary: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=4 --> &bull;(b) Paragraph (b) of &sect;417.546 (Physicians' services and other part B supplier services furnished under arrangements) and the Editorial note at the end of the section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Paragraph (d)(2) of &sect;417.560 (Apportionment: part B physician and supplier services). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;All of &sect;417.562 (Weighing of direct services furnished by physicians and other practitioners). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> VIII. Other Required Information <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Paperwork Reduction Act <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 417.532(b) (with respect to HMOs and CMPs) and &sect;417.800(c) (with respect to HCPPs) require those organizations to submit the information necessary for HCFA to determine whether payment in excess of the presumptive limit is appropriate, because of the health condition of the organization's Medicare enrollees, or because of extraordinary occurrences. The time needed to prepare the information would depend on the particular circumstances but would not, we believe, exceed 8 hours per organization. Section 417.576 requires HMOs and CMPs to submit certified cost reports as a basis for final settlement. We estimate that preparation of the full cost report will require 100 hours. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If you comment on the information collection requirements, please send a copy of those comments directly to: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=4 --> Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, room 3002, New Executive Office Bldg., Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Allison Herron Eydt, Desk Officer for HCFA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> B. Response to Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments that we receive by the date and time specified in the `` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> DATES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> '' section of this preamble, and if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the comments in the preamble to the final rule. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

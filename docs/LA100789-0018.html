			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEW;  </P> <P> GRIFFITH, MCMURTRY AT WADSWORTH  </P> <P> "She's like the Donna Reed of country music," said one fan at Nanci Griffith's  concert Thursday at the Wadsworth Theater, marveling over the Texas-bred  singer's infectious smile and indefatigable sweetness. That may be stretching  it, but think maybe of brainy Suzanne Vega -- whose wispy voice Griffith's own  resembles -- possessed by the sentimental spirit of Donna.  </P> <P> While the Age of Irony has permeated even the neo-folkie movement, Griffith is  someone who still projects old-style earnestness, and who saves most of the  humor for the between-song storytelling and not as a method to distance herself  from her own emotions. She's a little too eccentric to be a proper  easy-listening artist, and too traditionally sedate -- some might say precious  -- to be artsy, but her folksy and occasionally country-ish music does have a  following, evidenced by the Wadsworth's near-capacity turnout.  </P> <P> Thursday all that sincerity came off as charming, disarming and entertainingly  edgeless. Griffith can't be accused of skirting reality to achieve her  sweetness (songs like the new "Drive-In Movies and Dashboard Lights," about the  fate of a former "back-seat queen," have plenty of poignancy), but what you  carry away, more than her lyrical observations, is the way she'll jump up in  the air to end a song, or the helplessly-in-love-with-her-audience Donna smile,  or just the lingering sweetness.  </P> <P> Opening act James McMurtry's folk-rock anachronisms differ: He doesn't budge on  stage, has unfashionably parted frizzy hair, sings in a disaffected monotone  and indulges heavily in what he called "the serious songwriter thing." Catching  him at a coffeehouse, you might be transfixed by his promising songs, but at  the larger Wadsworth, his lack of passion was catching. If Griffith is a nice  antidote for 1989, offering real kindness and gentleness for what is actually a  less K&amp;G era, McMurtry is probably 15 years too late to impact with his  just-the-facts drawl.

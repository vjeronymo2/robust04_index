			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Commercial Union raising Pounds 100m and counts bomb cost COMMERCIAL UNION yesterday signalled its intention to increase its share of the UK insurance market by raising Pounds 100m through a preference share issue. The group, the most successful of the UK's composite insurers in recent years, also reported reduced pre-tax losses for the first quarter of 1992 and could be back in the black by the end of the year. Net losses (after reinsurance recoveries) from damage caused by the IRA bomb to CU's London headquarters and other buildings in the capital amounted to Pounds 15m, which would be taken in the second quarter. CU said it hoped to move back to its headquarters in a year. Pre-tax losses for the three months to March 31 amounted to Pounds 19.2m, compared with Pounds 24.2m, but losses per share rose to 5.3p (4.3p) after a charge for tax and minorities of Pounds 3.9m against Pounds 4.5m credit. Cazenove and Hoare Govett are brokers for the issue of Pounds 100m cumulative irredeemable preference shares, which have been placed. Mr Tony Wyand, executive director, explained that the intention was to reinforce the capital base in view of the rapid growth of the group's life business and the hardening in the UK non-life market. The extra capital would strengthen solvency and allow CU to increase non-life premium income by between Pounds 200m and Pounds 300m, he added. In the UK where rates have been increased for most lines income rose by 24 per cent to Pounds 473.2m (Pounds 380.1m), while total premiums rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 1.28bn (Pounds 1.11bn) According to Mr Stephen Bird, analyst with Smith New Court, CU was the only composite expanding its market share. Premium growth was particularly rapid in UK private motor, up 52 per cent to Pounds 48.9m, and London market marine and aviation (up 44.1 per cent to Pounds 80.2m). CU is also bullish about its life business, reporting new business growth of 46 per cent and an increase in life profits to Pounds 27m (Pounds 26.5m). Life premiums now account for 35 per cent of business compared with 18 per cent in 1982 and the group aims to increase the share to 50 per cent by the end of the decade.

			<p><P> September 21, 1989, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> LAKE TO BE RESTORED AT HANSEN DAM  </P> <P> Congress has approved $780,000 to begin restoration of the long-lost lake at  Hansen Dam in the Northeast Valley.  </P> <P> The funds, contained in the energy and water appropriations bill sent to  President Bush, were earmarked for the lake under a federal trust fund. The  fund was tapped last year for $200,000, which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  is using to develop a master plan for the Hansen Dam Flood Control Basin. The  plan is expected to include lake revitalization and recreational facilities.  </P> <P> The trust fund money is accrued from fees paid by contractor Bill Blomgren, who  signed a five-year contract with the corps in 1984 to dig out silt in flood  control channels for sale to construction firms. He pays the government 15  cents to 25 cents for each ton removed.  </P> <P> The once-thriving recreational area has been neglected for years. A small lake  that Blomgren excavated earlier this year was filled in with sand after the  corps said that it was unfit for swimming and fishing and posed a community  hazard.  </P></p>

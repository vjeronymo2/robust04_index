			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA 90) (Pub. L. 101&hyph;380) amends 46 U.S.C. 6101 by adding the term ``significant harm to the environment'' to the list of reportable marine casualties. The amendment also provides that foreign flag tank vessels operating in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction beyond the navigable waters of the United States (i.e., within the exclusive economic zone (EEZ)) must report to the extent consistent with generally recognized principles of international law, two categories of marine casualties, those resulting in_(1) material damage affecting the seaworthiness or efficiency of a vessel; and (2) significant harm to the environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard is interested in information and opinions concerning how the Coast Guard should respond to the following major issues raised by the amendments to 46 U.S.C. 6101 as set forth in OPA 90. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Should regulatory changes be made to define and secure reporting of ``significant harm to the environment'' casualties in the U.S. navigable waters (foreign flag and U.S. flag vessels)?

How should the Coast Guard define and implement the requirement for reporting of ``significant harm to the environment'' and ``material damage'' casualties for foreign flag tank vessels in waters subject to U.S. jurisdiction, including the EEZ, consistent with ``generally recognized principles of international law?'' Do the provisions of 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1(b) and (c) adequately define incidents which include ``material damage?'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. How should the Coast Guard impose any reporting requirements for foreign tank vessels in the EEZ_on inbound, outbound, or transiting vessels? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. Should any regulations be located as amendments to the existing regulations under 46 U.S.C. 6101 at 46 CFR part 4 or in the pollution prevention regulations implementing international pollution control agreements (33 CFR part 151)? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Attendance at the January 20, 1995 meeting is open to the public.

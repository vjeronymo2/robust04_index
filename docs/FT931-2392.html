			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Moscow seeks active G7 backing for reforms RUSSIA'S deputy premier for the economy and finance has proposed to the Group of Seven leading industrial countries a seven-point plan that will demand more resources and greater engagement in the Russian economy than they have so far been prepared to agree. In talks with the G7 'sherpas' (senior officials) in Hong Kong a week ago and with western diplomats in Moscow since, Mr Boris Fyodorov has proposed a package which, depending on how it is costed, would be worth between Dollars 10bn and Dollars 40bn-plus. But Mr Fyodorov has stressed, according to western diplomats, that the money is less important than a continuous and serious engagement in economic reform, with major foreign states making sure Russia fulfils the conditions on which money is advanced. The main points of the package are: A 'budgetary support' fund of around Dollars 3bn-Dollars 4bn, mainly destined for creation of a social safety net - though western analysts also say it may be used for other programmes, such as military conversion and nuclear safety. This is the major new element in the package and the most controversial. The west may find it hard to sell politically and is reluctant to be seen forcing Russia to create a pool of unemployed which they would then support. A small business support programme, worth several hundred million dollars. A Dollars 6bn fund to be used to stabilise the rouble. Such a provision is already made in the current, much derided IMF-administered package of Dollars 24bn but has not been used because the government has not been able to create the conditions for rouble stabilisation. Debt relief from the interest and principal due on the Dollars 80bn of foreign debt which Russia has inherited from the former Soviet Union - which, with arrears, runs at Dollars 40bn this year. Access to western markets for Russian products from high-tech armaments to low-grade steel. Bilateral credits from various contries - though this is now seen as less important and some ministers, including yesterday Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, the first deputy prime minister, are against accepting any further increases in indebtedness. Better co-ordination of the aid and a tougher conditions regime. Mr Fyodorov, who greatly impressed the G7 sherpas in Hong Kong, has made a point of not asking for assistance but co-operation. The west believes that he, with Mr Shokhin and Mr Anatoly Chubais, the deputy premier in charge of privatisation, are firmly in command of the economic strategy.</p>

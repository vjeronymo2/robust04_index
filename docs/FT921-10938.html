			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel Memo to UK government: give in quickly to Eurotunnel's cheeky compensation claim for the cost of additional safety requirements. A settlement would provide ideal cover for a state cash injection urgently needed to head off an electorally damaging row if the tunnel operator and the UK contractors fail to resolve their own dispute over costs. Memo to investors: don't count on it.</p>

It is the designated bidding system that is  considered the root of many evils. Will dango [bid-rigging by  collusion] really be made to disappear? Only system theories are  being advanced without a view to controlling economic crime.    "The element that includes the opinions of those making the  designations is strong in designated bidding. It is necessary  first to push for fairness all around, not whether this is a  proper method (as a method for ordering public works  construction)" (Mitsugi Madokoro, deputy mayor, Sendai).    A public announcement for construction bids for four public  works proejcts was made on 2 September in Sendai, where former  Mayor Toru Ishii was arrested and indicted on charges of  accepting bribes as the beginning of a series of general  contractor bribes. The bidding system is the first "restricted  general competitive bidding" in the city. It was hastily  introduced as the focus of measures to prevent impropriety.    However, they have balked at applying it from the very  start.  A total of 140 companies applied for the four projects. The 99  companies that passed the qualifications screening of seven  items such as operations record and examination of business  particulars, were present at the bidding on the 15th. In the  previous designated bidding in Sendai, four to 12 companies were  designated as bidders for one construction project. With the  sudden increase in companies applying to bid, "The amount of  work tripled. We even worked on Saturdays. We will not be able  to handle it if it continues this way" (Deputy Mayor Madokoro).    It is a system that was introduced without adequate study.  The reform of the bidding system without preparation has started  in chaos.    Since the exposure of bribery by general contractors  commenced, general competitive bidding systems have been  introduced in rapid succession by central and regional agencies  ordering public works construction. On 2 July, three days after  the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Special Investigation  Department exposed the Sendai incident, Kishiro Nakamura,  Minister of Construction (at the time) announced the study of an  introduction of restricted general competitive bidding. Since  September, actual trials have begun with 13 large construction  projects of over 1 billion yen.    Local governments such as Chiba Prefecture, Hiroshima  Prefecture, and including Sendai City and Ibaraki Prefecture  where there have been incidents, have announced plans for  introduction. Moreover, on 1 October, the Ministry of Home  Affairs sent out an administrative vice minister circular notice  seeking an early test of a restricted general competitive  bidding system on public works construction for prefectures and  government-ordinance designated cities.    The Ministry of Construction had just refused, considering  that the U.S. demand for introduction of general competitive  bidding was removed from the existing agenda in review talks on  the U.S.-Japan Construction Conference during the middle of  June. The actual situation was that they acted hastily in  response to shock at the incidents and public criticism. The  introduction of restricted (conditions) general competitive  bidding is now being treated as a trump card for rectifying  construction corruption such as dango [bid-rigging by collusion]  and bid determination by "the voice of heaven" directed at a  rigged system.    Indeed, much of the bidding corruption discovered so far has  been related to the strong power of order placers in the  designated competitive bidding system. However, has that alone  invited bidding impropriety and is reform of the bidding system  really linked to eradication of dango? There is no proof of that.    The series of system reforms has been put in motion without  adequate debate.    "It is not that corruption will completely disappear if  system A is replaced by system B" (Ministry of Construction  bureau director level officer). Many people involved with  construction view rather coolly the recent moves to reform the  system. "Inherently, the bidding system is conducted for the  purpose of ordering good-quality public works construction as  cheaply as possible. Bidding impropriety is a problem in  application of the system" (Tokonosuke Hasegawa, managing  director of the Construction Economy Research Institute).    Compared to the United States and Europe, where penal  servitude is applied to the crime of bid-rigging, penalties are  light in Japan for economic crimes such as construction dango.  Only discussion of an entrance system which lacks the concept of  control is proceeding.  <H5>  Actual State of Dango </H5>   By what kind of system is dango, coordination by businesses  in receiving orders, a common practice in public works  construction orders in Japan, conducted? Let's look at the  example of the "Saitama Doyokai," a bid-rigging organization in  Saitama that was forced to dissolve in June 1991 when exposed by  the Fair Trade Commission.    In Saitama Prefecture, qualifications to participate in  designated competitive bidding is determined by the scale of the  construction work ordered. A five-step ranking system of Circle  A, A, B, C, and D is made by examination of business, etc.  Members of the Doyokai are of the highest Circle A rank. There  were 66 companies when it disbanded. All have home offices  outside of the prefecture and are affiliated with major firms in  the industry within the prefecture. It is operated with the  objective of gathering together the persons responsible or  semi-responsible at the branches or business offices and  coordinating receipt of orders for all the civil engineering  construction work ordered by cities, towns and villages in the  prefecture.    "As a rule, the prospective winner is decided among members  who want to receive the order for each construction project. In  discussions for this purpose, every fiscal year the members  submit to the Doyokai a document called the `PR memo' which  lists about 15 plus 10 of the construction work orders wanted.  Meetings are held depending on the necessity, and the  prospective winner is determined by such evaluation criteria as  whether a memo was submitted, time of submission, accuracy of  details, and past construction record related to said  construction work," testified a former member of the Doyokai on  the method of operation at a hearing by the Fair Trade  Commission.    Afterwards, the members who were designated by the order  placer contacted each other on bid prices for each member  participating in the bid to be certain of receiving the order.  It is said there were no accidents where "a mistake was made"  and a business other than the prospective winner successfully  got the bid or acts of betrayal while this member was enrolled.    The officer of a business office of a different company  which  had become a member explains the motive for coordinating receipt  of orders, "It is because we did not want to go so far as  accepting orders at a loss by bashing each other in competition."    However, the officer of a major general contractor that  participated in the Doyokai explains, "Even though they say  there was coordination in receipt of orders, it was not done  systematically. The actual situation in getting construction  work orders is excessive competition everywhere, and though they  say there is bid-rigging, there still is a fierce scramble for  work." Naturally, a dango organization will not function  perfectly just by a discussion among businesses on equal terms.    In the Doyokai, the officers controlled traffic in their  role  as elders. "When a member came with a memo for consultation, we  provided information in advance and or instructed him to abandon  it" (Doyokai officer). When a decision is not easily made after  discussion, the officers arbitrate. "In arbitration on large  construction projects such as dams, it seems there even were  cases of a voice of heaven from the private secretary of the  former governor, Yawara Hata" (Toshio Tajima, chief,  Administrative Office, Saitama Doyokai Dango Resident Plaintiff  Group).    The greatest part of the coordination is "relief aid" that  is  passed around in the form of subcontracts for a certain  percentage of the construction work total from the construction  work order received so as not to generate dissatisfaction among  members because of bias in the record of receiving orders. This  is equivalent to a contract violation if they are not publicly  announced as a subcontracting business when the order is  received and is generally called a surreptitious joint  [venture]. This "relief aid" is considered more integral than  coordination in receiving orders.    Jotaro Yabe, chief of the Economic Department, Federal Trade  Commission, explains that, "In order for such dango  organizations to function, naturally, information leaks from the  order placer play a big role." As in the previous testimony,  information about construction work that becomes the deciding  factor in determining the prospective winner in the dango  organization can only be known by the order placer before the  bidding is publicly announced.    Furthermore, for the prospective winner to make certain that  he will receive the order before the bidding, he invariably  distributes a "chit" to the businesses designated to participate  in the bidding along with him, being thoroughly clear in stating  the respective amounts to be entered. It is something that  cannot be done unless they know beforehand the estimated price  calculated by the order placer and the lowest bid price. From  the view of the order placer, an order can be placed within the  price range estimated and it has merit in that administrative  procedures become smooth. Thus, the dango organization has also  involved the order placer.  <H5>  Deeply Rooted Cartel Constitution </H5>   Yabe, chief of the Federal Trade Commission Economic  Department, views dango organizations in the construction  industry as "being organized in most order-placing agency units  nationwide." Furthermore, as a factor for dango becoming chronic  in the construction industry, he explains that "cartels arise in  industries where there is excessive competition as well as where  there is only price competition and commodity differentiation is  impossible. The construction industry is the greatest one of  those."    Under industry protection policy, the number of construction  businesses currently approved by the minister and governor has  ballooned to 520,000 companies. Among these, it is estimated  that at least 30,000 companies have received orders for public  works construction in the form of a general contract. In Saitama  Prefecture, there are 66 companies with the highest rank in the  Doyokai membership alone. About 30 companies are in the A rank  companies of the Ministry of Construction Regional Construction  Bureaus. It is an industry with excessive competition not  usually seen in other industries.    Furthermore, according to Director Etsusuke Masuda of the  Tokyo Branch of Solomon Brothers Asia Securities who is  knowledgeable about technical innovations in the construction  industry, "For the most part, construction is now what is called  a mature technology. Even in civil engineering, where there is  great room for technical innovation, when new technology is used  in public works construction, it must be disclosed to receive  approval of the authorities. There is little advantage for  technical innovation in the business aspect." When there is  competition for orders, inevitably only price competition called  "bashing each other" can occur.    For this reason, the construction industry spontaneously  cultivated the habit of avoiding competition by dango. An  officer of a midsized general contractor explains this process  by dividing it into four steps.    "For construction work or construction areas that we have  been involved in for some time or construction work in places  where there are deep ties with that business, we are silent as  the moral code of the industry and approve receipt of the order  by a specified business. That is the first step. The second step  is the method of deciding by discussion with fellow businesses  who among them wants to do it. This is a method that is possible  because bidding participants are limited by the designation  system and we know who the competitors are. Coordination is made  based on a performance sheet called the score sheet."    However, in many cases, because there is underlying  excessive  competition, coordination cannot be easily made just among the  businesses. In that case, the existence of a high-ranking  arbitrator becomes necessary.    "The third step is when industry big shots or bosses become  the arbitrators. Until now, it has been independent coordination  on receiving orders by businesses. In this case, the boss and  the business negotiate directly.    "However, if a strong boss does not appear from among the  businesses, ultimately an arbitrator is sought outside. It takes  the form of calling on a person who has rather strong authority.  This is the fourth step. Since the current dango system itself  is premised on bid prices, construction work information, and  designation, there is a high degree of dependence on the order  placer. So, it calls for strong authority in placing orders. It  is a Construction-zoku Diet member in a field such as river  river control, or the head of a local government. You might say  that they stand at the pinnacle of the dango system."    When there are many who want to receive the order for large  projects, they issue the so-called voice of heaven; the dango  system has become a form which accepts that, and the prospective  winner is decided. Since the boss is a person outside the  industry, it becomes a much more arbitrary decision than  coordination on receiving orders. By seeking voice of heaven  arbitration, a rebate battle spreads among businesses. Sendai  and Ibaraki are typical forms of this.    In both Sendai City and Ibaraki Prefecture, the large  construction work was crowded with the largest general  contractors who staked their honor with the aim of receiving the  orders. Moreover, in Sendai City, former Mayor Ishii was opposed  to the boss of the business side in the large dango organization  that spanned six Tohoku prefectures. Sendai City alone has  broken away from this organization. Moreover, in Ibaraki  Prefecture, dango organizations such as the "Ibaraki Doyokai"  have disbanded and the system of coordination among businesses  has weakened.    There was a large project with total project costs of 70  billion yen, the moving of Ibaraki Prefecture government  buildings, and in addition, the reconstruction of the  prefectural medical university. Fujio Takeuchi, former governor,  in December of last year, was asked to be a mediator for  receiving orders at the Ibaraki Prefecture Public Hall by Teruzo  Yoshino, former chairman of Shimizu Corp., and received 10  million yen. After that, it is said that the voice of heaven was  issued.    Table 1. Steps for Dango   Step 1                 Silent dango            1) In case of first-term                                                 construction, to first-term                                                 contracting company; 2) In                                                 case of domains such as                                                 roads, buildings, bridges, to                                                 company possessing domain; 3)                                                 In cases of there being a                                                 company that has researched                                                 that construction for several                                                 years such as the Tokyo Bay                                                 Tunnel, to that company.   Step 2                 Score sheet             Companies who want to do it                                                 among 10 designated companies                                                 discuss it, if 2 companies,                                                 then 2 companies. On those                                                 occasions, the "score sheet"                                                 of past discussions for those                                                 2 companies carries weight.                                                 In the case of 4 companies,                                                 it is tournament style.   Step 3                 Voice from heaven 1     Without discussion by the                                                 aforementioned 2 companies to                                                 4 companies, they                                                 respectively negotiate with                                                 rigging boss and boss                                                 arbitrates. There are many                                                 cases where boss is chosen                                                 from industry group.   Step 4                 Voice from heaven 2     Boss listens to talk from                                                 designated companies and                                                 arbitrates. Only the boss                                                 knows which companies have                                                 shown interest in doing it.                                                 There are many cases where                                                 boss is a politician,                                                 headman, or their close                                                 associate.   Note: In any case, fairness is important so that it will be seen on a score  sheet. However, there is construction work that they would like to do and  construction work that they would not like to do, and the boss's authority  on that point is absolute. In steps 3 and 4, there are many cases where the  boss designates joint-venture partners.      The bidding system, which was a system to eliminate the  arbitrariness of the order placer, has been completely wrecked  at this stage.  <H5>  Abuse of Designated Bidding </H5>   Kunio Maeda, professor at Fuji University, an expert on the  inside affairs of the construction industry, explains that "the  designated competitive bidding system and political adhesion  have gone hand in hand to shape current construction  corruption." It has been previously pointed out that the  designated competitive bidding system is deeply involved in  forming the unfair structure of the structured construction  bidding.    Exposure of general contractor bribery is continuing and  almost all the measures to eradicate corruption are aimed at the  single aspect of reviewing designated competitive bidding.    On 29 September, at the third meeting of the special  committee of the Central Council on Construction Contracting  Business, an advisory organ to the minister of construction, a  hearing on expert opinions was conducted. Here, the Fair Trade  Commission pointed out the problem areas of the current bidding  system from its experience in investigating construction dango  in cases of violation of the antitrust law.    They cited chiefly problems with application: 1) inability  to  regulate arbitrariness of order placer because designation  criteria are not clear; 2) lack of thorough control of  confidential information such as estimated prices on which dango  is premised; 3) split orders, which easily invites sharing by  businesses; 4) persuasion of being forced into construction work  at a loss is becoming an element that invites dango; 5)  excessive demand for formation of joint business entities easily  invites rigging; 6) when a construction-completion guarantor  system is required to be established by the other designated  businesses, there will be no guarantors without participation in  dango and it becomes a compelling force for dango organizations.    Furthermore, Economic Department head Yabe proposes  approaching a general competitive bidding system as soon as  possible, saying, "with the current designated competitive  bidding system basis, the designated businesses are apt to be  biased to a set scope of people and cooperation among the  businesses is easily generated. It will be difficult to carry  out dango if the participants are not fixed."    Managing Director Hasegawa of the Construction Economy  Research Institute also points out that problems with the  designated competitive bidding system are in its application. He  stresses that "impropriety is generated from bad use of the  system. It also can be called a problem of the social background  and nature of those applying it. The starting point is to return  to the inherent nature of the bidding system and ensure fairness  and transparency."    "There has been debate about whether it will be resolved  just  by becoming general competitive bidding, but the system and  impropriety should be grasped from different viewpoints.  Moreover, looking at bidding systems worldwide, a complete  general competitive bidding system does not exist. In public  works construction bidding, there is the aspect of maintaining  construction quality above a certain level as well as price.  Some restrictions are necessary to ensure construction work or  the quality of the construction business. The problem lies  strictly in application, not the form of the bidding system."    Kunihisa Ono, director of the Construction Economy Bureau,  Ministry of Construction, the person in charge of the job of  reviewing the ordering system, explains that, "even if we  conduct a general competitive bidding system, it will be  necessary to attach various conditions. Ranking is another  method. Transparency of the qualifications screening will be  important. For example, it will be possible to eliminate the  arbitrariness of order placers by disclosing the reasons to  businesses that were left out because of designation or  qualifications screening."    Currently, the limited general competitive bidding that has  begun to be introduced by various ordering agencies first of all  accepts applications of businesses desiring to bid, keeping the  previous ranking, and later narrows the businesses participating  in the bidding by applying screening criteria according to the  construction work. There has been repeated study on making the  screening transparent, but currently it is no more than the  dimension of eliminating designation beforehand. Debate on the  application aspect is still belated.    Furthermore, no study has been made about whether they were  forced into a cartel constitution by the system and its  application. There is the strong aspect that new systems have  been hastily and prematurely introduced just by including the  words "general competition."  <H5>  Crime Is Offset </H5>   A general contractor officer relates, "Dango inherently  arises out of the cartel constitution. It will remain even if  you change the form of the system."    "There is the opinion that current elaborate dango systems  united with order placers will no longer be realized by changing  the system and application. However, there is bid-rigging in the  United States and Europe. It will continue to exist in some  form." This seems to be the general feeling of those involved  with general contractors.    Hiroshi Iyori, consultant to the Mitsubishi Research  Institute and former chief of the Investigation Department of  the Fair Trade Commission who exposed a violation of the  antitrust law in a case of dango by the Shizuoka Construction  Industry Association that included major general contractors in  1982, stresses that "serious penalties must be levied, not just  introduction of general competitive bidding." Hasegawa, director  of the Construction Economy Research Institute, also points out  that "The perception that rigging is a crime is weak among both  businesses and the public. To curb economic crime, those acts  must be made high risk."    The Saitama Doyokai was levied a fine as well as a  recommendation to disband. The total amount was 1,006,670,000  yen, a levy of 1.5 percent of the total order received by the 43  companies considered to have received orders by dango.  Currently, it has been raised to 6 percent of the total order  received. This too is somewhat light compared to the penal  servitude applied in the United States and Europe.    "This industry has been created so far by coordination and  cooperation. It has been rumored that, due to public criticism,  they will be unable to get public works construction orders  after their suspension has been removed, but it seems that they  will be able to occupy the same position as before in the world  of order coordination in the future." It is Hazama whose  unprecedented shameful conduct was exposed when the chairman and  president were arrested in both the Sendai and Ibaraki cases.  The officer of that influential lending bank coolly relates thus  about the future. Hazama embraces bad debts due to the collapse  of the bubble and if it had been another industrial sector, it  would have fallen into plenty of financial difficulty.    However, although its target for orders received this term  has fallen over 100 billion yen, its is not in a dangerous  situation. In one case, suspension was two to four months. Even  with Hazama, which seems to have incurred the greatest damage,  it is possible that its performance will be restored in three  years at the minimum.    Speaking of impropriety in public works construction  bidding,  economically it has become a matter of "fully offsetting the  crime." That is because the risk of being exposed is too light.  This fact has become one of the elements why the corrupt  constitution has been pointed out for a long time, but not  changed.    The case that points out that strengthened penalties will  become a strong force to curb dango occurred in 1989. The United  States demanded loss compensation in an amount uncommon in Japan  of 5-15 billion yen from the members of the "Seiyukai" dango  organization of businesses with access to Yokosuka Naval Base,  who the previous year were ordered to pay a fine of 289 million  yen as violation of the antitrust law. Ultimately, after  negotiations, 99 companies agreed to pay 4.7 billion yen.    "This was powerful. Afterward, since 1990, it has weakened  outward activities such as disbanding of dango organizations in  various areas" (Fair Trade Commission source).    Being under excessive competition to win, no matter how much  the system is changed, the conditions for cartels have not  changed. There is nothing else to stop that activity except  making the loss sustained from rigging exposure greater than the  profits obtained from the rigging. Inherently, the order placers  should have loss compensation for the high priced orders  received due to rigging, but "that should not be desired in a  situation where even the order placers are involved in the  rigging system" (Fair Trade Commission source).    The recent review of public works bidding has begun to be a  chance for reflection on construction corruption, but we are  proceeding still lacking the most important elements of  controlling economic crime and strengthening penalties.</p>

			<p>921012 FT  12 OCT 92 / Pople: Langdon: at centre of water industry Janet Langdon, who takes up her position as director of the Water Services Association this month, says one of the attractions of the job was that 'I wanted to do something different - and water is so important in people's lives.' Langdon, 52, joins at a high-profile time for the WSA, which represents the 10 large publicly quoted water and sewerage companies in England and Wales. The companies are engaged in a tough debate with Ofwat, their financial regulator, the National Rivers Authority, the water standards watchdog, and the EC Environment Council about whether some water standards directives are unnecessarily and expensively high. She will become director at the end of the month when the WSA's secretary, Michael Carney retires. Widely travelled in developing countries, she will spend the next few months crossing the UK to visit WSA members. Langdon, who has lectured in chemistry at Wellesley College, Massachusetts, was previously director of the export division of GEC Alsthom, and has also worked at Shell, the National Economic Development Office and Distillers. She says 'one of my hobby-horses has been government-industry relations'; while at Shell she was seconded to the DTI. Three years down the road from privatisation, the companies are increasingly diverging in investment, financing and diversification plans. She says 'obviously you are not going to get a consensus,' and adds, 'coming from the private sector I look on them as independent companies'.</p>

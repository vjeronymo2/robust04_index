			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Europe moves closer on acid rain A COMPROMISE is emerging between European countries seeking a timetable to reduce emissions from power stations which cause acid rain. The new targets could be agreed at a meeting of the Economic Commission for Europe in Geneva next month. The deal would bridge the gap between countries such as Germany and Norway which favour tough targets and those wanting more leeway on timing, like the UK. Britain's resistance to the toughest standards has risked undermining some of its recently-improved reputation for addressing the acid rain problem. Sulphur emissions were one of the main reasons Britain was christened the 'dirty man of Europe' years ago, a tag it has found difficult to shake off. The ECE deal, including countries from east and west, is expected to lay the basis for new emission standards for power stations in the European Community next year. The compromise will aim at reducing sulphur emissions by up to 90 per cent by the year 2005. This is being proposed to bridge the gap between the year 2000 being sought by countries seeking to accelerate the clean-up and the 2010 target preferred by those, particularly in east Europe, with a long way to go. The reductions would be based on the 'critical load' approach, which takes account of an area's ability to withstand acid rain. The UK's position is diplomatically sensitive because its large coal-fired power stations have been blamed for causing acid rain in many continental countries and Scandinavia. Britain did not subscribe to an earlier ECE agreement to cut sulphur emissions by 30 per cent, though in the event it met the target. This time, the UK is still resisting a tough timetable, and proposes to support the 2005 target compromise. Only two British power stations are being fitted with equipment to remove sulphur from the exhaust gases, and power companies are fighting pressure to fit any more because of the high cost. Instead, the UK intends to switch to cleaner fuels such as natural gas or low sulphur coal. The new ECE agreement will provide the background to the EC's review of the large combustion plants directive next year. This already lays down emission reduction targets for power stations, but these were always due to be tightened in 1994. Members states may therefore keep something in reserve when negotiating in Geneva next month.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Angolan Armed Forces, FAA, have restored control  over the entire region around Malongo base in Cabinda Province,  which UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence of  Angola] troops shelled on 1 January.    [Begin recording] [FAA spokesman Colonel Manuel Paiva] What  happened in Malongo was that an unspecified number of enemy  soldiers approached the Malongo oil complex under cover of  darkness in an attempt to inflict economic losses on the  petroleum company. The enemy fired a number of 81-mm mortar  rounds from (Siela), near the Socoto valley. That is about 4 km  from the Malongo oil complex. Fortunately, the five rounds that  the enemy fired did not cause material or human losses. In  response, our troops inflicted an unspecified number of  casualties on the enemy, forcing it to withdraw in disarray. So  that was what happened on 1 January 1994.    [Reporter] So, is the situation under control right now?    [Paiva] Yes. Our troops have taken the necessary  precautions. One should point out that small groups are moving  in the (Pande Vinte) and Sabantando regions. Our troops are  ready to give an adequate response. [end recording]</p>

But If You Went to School With Pavel Grachev It Might  Be Invented for You"]    [Text] Sources in the Russian Federation Defense Ministry  report that increasingly serious irritation at the minister's  personnel policy is brewing among officers and generals in the  military department. Photocopies of the biographical details of  generals in Pavel Grachev's immediate entourage who have moved  up the promotion ladder unusually swiftly for the military have  been circulated in Russian Federation Defense Ministry  directorates and departments and the General Staff in the past  few days.    These generals include Lieutenant General Valeriy Lapshov,  leader of the defense minister's administration, who was an  ordinary senior officer in the General Staff Main Operations  Directorate until 1991. He once studied in the same group as  Grachev at the General Staff Academy. In fall of 1991 Grachev,  who was then Shaposhnikov's deputy, took him under his wing,  making him first a major general, and later a lieutenant  general. It is confirmed that only Deputy Minister Valeriy  Mironov, who at that time supervised personnel questions,  objected to Lapshov acquiring the rank of colonel general. (He  is not supervising them any more.) Today Lapshov occupies one  of the key posts in the Defense Ministry: He largely controls  whether a particular document or person reaches the minister.  Among the senior officers in the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry, Lapshov is known as a sociable man, an indispensable  organizer of dinners for friends. It cannot be ruled out that  this is precisely the reason why the equally sociable Pavel  Grachev took a shine to him.    Major General Sergey Zdorikov, a career political worker  recently appointed chief of the Russian Federation Defense  Ministry Directorate for Work With Personnel, was also a student  in the same group as Grachev and Lapshov at the General Staff  Academy. According to the recollections of his fellow students,  he was renowned as an extremely undisciplined student and  persistent truant. Now he is the head teacher in the Russian  Army.    Dmitriy Kharchenko was also a student in the same group as  Grachev, Lapshov, and Zdorikov. After the General Staff  Academy, he was in command of a supernumerary [zashtatnyy]  division near Nizhniy Novgorod for a short time, and then became  chief of the General Staff International Treaty Directorate. He  has neither a legal nor a diplomatic education, but he quickly  obtained the post of lieutenant general and moved up to deputy  chief of the General Staff, although it would appear that the  post of chief of an ordinary General Staff directorate does not  merit this promotion. The military department suspects that the  explanation is quite simple: Kharchenko managed to become part  of Grachev's family -- their children married. It is now  planned that Kharchenko's directorate will be given main  directorate status, and he himself will be awarded the rank of  colonel general.    Gennadiy Ivanov also studied together with Grachev, Lapshov,  Zdorikov, and Kharchenko at the General Staff Academy. Before  studying at the academy, he headed a group at an  operational-strategic research center, now abolished in view of  the fact that it was completely useless. According to his  classmates' opinions, he was no genius, but, following Grachev's  appointment as defense minister, the latter took Colonel Ivanov  under his wing -- and made him first chief of group and then  chief of the Directorate for Military Organizational Development  and Reform. This directorate was dubbed "Directorate for the  Rising and Setting of the Sun" at the Defense Ministry. Within  a short time Ivanov became lieutenant general and today is in  charge of all questions connected with the reform of the Army.  Everyone has the right to judge for themselves the results of  his work.    Major General Vladimir Nikitin, chief of the Russian  Federation Defense Ministry Administrative Directorate, alas,  did not go to school with Grachev, Lapshov, Zdorikov,  Kharchenko, and Ivanov. Maybe that is why, having entered the  Main Personnel Directorate as an ordinary civilian employee, he  only reached the rank of major over a period of a number of  years. However, the events of August 1991 were his hour of  triumph -- after spending three days in the "White House,"  Nikitin was invited to join the State-Legal Administration under  the Russian Federation president. There, within a year, he  became a major general (although, as his fellow workers joke,  before he received his general's shoulder boards, he had never  been in command of any larger troop grouping than a couple of  typists), and returned to the Defense Ministry to head the  Administrative Directorate.    People in the Defense Ministry recall that after  Shaposhnikov's unruly democracy, Grachev's arrival here was  greeted with enthusiasm. And at first, relying on comrades from  Afghanistan, from Gromov and Mironov to the late Dubynin, he  really was able to establish some kind of order and restore the  practically lost command and control of both the troops and the  apparatus. However, in time, some of his former friends  distanced themselves from the minister, some were moved aside,  and the posts of the closest advisers were occupied by other,  more convenient people. That, according to one high-ranking  Defense Ministry staffer, is Pavel Grachev's tragedy.    ...The list of the defense minister's current entourage runs  to more than one page. Reading the service records of the  closest people, some people get exasperated and indignant, while  others just laugh. However, in our opinion, it is more alarming  that increasing numbers of professional servicemen, coming up  against such cases, get fed up and leave the apparatus of the  military department. The question "Whom are we serving?" is  being asked behind the scenes increasingly frequently in the  Defense Ministry and the General Staff. The technical elite --  the purchasing directorates of the Defense Ministry: the  Defense Ministry Main Rocket and Artillery Directorate, the Main  Armored Directorate, the GATU [expansion unknown], and the 12th  Main Directorate, and the chemical troops... -- are being  gradually left without work. The Army is being deprived of the  most important thing -- military intellect, which, despite the  not entirely groundless jokes of the man in the street, did  nevertheless exist. What are we getting in return?</p>

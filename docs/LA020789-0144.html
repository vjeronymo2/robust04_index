			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FROM $169,277 TO $211,402 IN 1987-88, REALTORS SAY;  </P> <P> MEDIAN RESALE COUNTY HOUSE COST RISES 24.9%  </P> <P> It will not surprise many Orange County residents to learn that prices of  resale houses in the county rose faster last year than in any other urban area  in the state.  </P> <P> On a year-to-year basis, the median price of such houses rose 24.9% last year,  the California Assn. of Realtors said Monday.  </P> <P> The median price was $169,277 for 1987 and $211,402 for 1988. That was also the  highest price of any urban area in California, which saw an 18.4% increase in  prices of such houses, to a median of $165,602. The figures do not include  condominiums or new houses.  </P> <P> The number of houses sold in the county ranked just ninth among the 12 regions  surveyed by the association, but demand was so great for homes that it pushed  prices through the roof.  </P> <P> The association said it expects the market to cool slightly this year and  prices to rise more slowly.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, affording a home became a problem for more county residents during  the year, the association said.  </P> <P> Just 20% of the county's families could afford a median-priced, existing house  last year, which the association calculated would require monthly payments of  $1,642.  </P> <P> It would take an annual household income of $65,672 to make those payments,  according to the association.  </P> <P> Those figures compare with 26% of statewide households that can afford such  houses.  </P> <P> In 1987, 29% of the county's families could afford the median-priced existing  house.  </P></p>

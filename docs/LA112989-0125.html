			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: LOOK WHO'S TALKING ABOUT TRAVOLTA'S 'RETURN'  </P> <P> "COMEBACK? I hate that word. It's return -- a return to the millions of people  who've never forgiven me for deserting the screen!" -- Gloria Swanson as the  splendidly self-deluded Norma Desmond in "Sunset Boulevard," written by Billy  Wilder and Charles Brackett.  </P> <P> JOHN TRAVOLTA's presence in the mega-hit comedy "Look Who's Talking" has  certainly heated up the actor's recently ice-cold career. So much so that Amy  Heckerling, the writer and director of "Look Who's Talking," has pitched to  Paramount the idea of starring Travolta in a third follow-up to his 1978 smash,  "Saturday Night Fever." This would continue the adventures of one-time disco  king and Broadway dancer Tony Manero (Sylvester Stallone directed John in the  "Staying Alive" sequel -- reshaping his body at the same time.)  </P> <P> If "Saturday Night Fever III" gets the green light, Heckerling will once again  put Travolta through his paces. And a success in this project would firmly  re-establish John as a hot box-office commodity all on his own. That is,  without an adorable baby spouting wisecracks in Bruce Willis' voice. Comeback  or return, it's good to have Travolta circulating.  </P> <P> VANESSA REDGRAVE ends her 12-week limited engagement of "Orpheus Descending" on  Sunday, Dec. 17, and Broadway will be considerably less exciting with this  brilliant, controversial actress gone from the boards. The moment Vanessa ends  her rigors portraying Tennessee Williams' tragic Lady, the actress will undergo  microsurgery on her knee. It was injured some time ago during the early run of  "Orpheus." The producers say that Vanessa was scheduled to end her run on the  17th anyway, but if the star had been able to continue her dazzling and  athletic performance without pain, it seems likely that "Orpheus," which has  been the highest grossing play on Broadway every week since its opening, would  have extended its run.  </P> <P> K.D. LANG will "absolutely torch and twang" the TV airwaves on "Saturday Night  Live" this weekend. She now plans to be really "live from New York." The  Canadian singing sensation wants to bring back Irving Berlin's great musical  "Annie Get Your Gun." Ethel Merman immortalized Annie on stage and Betty Hutton  did the 1950 movie version. A revival of this rousing show is overdue and  wouldn't k.d. be perfect belting out those Berlin showstoppers -- "Doin' What  Comes Naturally" and "You Can't Get a Man With A Gun"? K.D. Lang as Annie  Oakley -- on Broadway -- an idea whose time has definitely come!  </P> <P> VCR BUFFS and Tina Turner fans are having a good time recording, playing back  and pausing her steamy "Steamy Windows" music video. All these interested  parties are trying to discern what -- if anything -- Tina is wearing underneath  her crocheted white minidress. Turner, who recently turned a fabulous 50, will  never tell. Like many another glamorous lady of a certain age, Tina appreciates  the value of illusion.  </P></p>

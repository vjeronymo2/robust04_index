			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE UNION COMPLAINS AT OFFICERS' TRIAL;  </P> <P> COURT: COLLEAGUES REPORTEDLY FEAR DISCIPLINARY ACTION FOR TESTIFYING ON THE  DEPARTMENT'S TRANSIENT ROUNDUP POLICY.  </P> <P> The kidnaping and robbery trial of two San Diego police officers took a  surprise turn Tuesday when the police union complained to the judge that  several officers feel they are being threatened with discipline for testifying  for the defendants about a controversial practice of rounding up transients in  the downtown area.  </P> <P> The complaint from the Police Officers Assn. came in the form of a short note  handed by the defense attorneys to Superior Court Judge Judith Haller as the  trial was resuming after lunch.  </P> <P> According to the message, several officers have complained to the POA that they  feel "threatened and intimidated" because the lieutenant in the police Internal  Affairs unit has sat through the weeklong trial, taking extensive notes on  their testimony.  </P> <P> The judge immediately asked that the lieutenant, Glenn Breitenstein, be ordered  to take the stand to explain his presence in the courtroom.  </P> <P> But Breitenstein abruptly disappeared from the courthouse just as the POA was  registering its complaint, and could not be found the rest of the afternoon. A  subpoena was issued for him and he is expected to testify today.  </P> <P> Steve McMillan, POA vice president and chairman of the group's legal defense  fund, said outside the courtroom that he was "outraged" with Breitenstein's  conduct -- first for "spying" on the officers and then for leaving "when he got  caught."  </P> <P> "It's just the way he acts," McMillan said, his face growing red with anger as  he described how the lieutenant even ordered him to leave the courthouse when  he showed up with the complaint note. "He doesn't treat people with dignity and  respect."  </P> <P> Everett Bobbitt, one of the defense attorneys, said: "It's embarrassing that  this is going on. It upsets me a lot. Officers may not be as candid as they'd  like to be with the lieutenant in charge of Internal Affairs sitting there  taking notes."  </P> <P> Bobbitt and McMillan said Breitenstein's only purpose at the trial was to  discipline any officers who testify on behalf of the defendants, Officers Lloyd  J. Hoff Jr. and Richard P. Schaaf. They said the Police Department also  apparently wants to discipline any officers who might embarrass the department  by testifying about the roundup policy.  </P> <P> "I would not put it past the department," McMillan said. "We're having officers  come in here and say what's the common practice downtown. They're telling the  truth about a policy that is not sanctioned by the department.  </P> <P> "But that's the only way we have to clean up the downtown. Just because we do  it doesn't make it right. But what else would the city have us do?"  </P> <P> Hoff and Schaaf, who are on voluntary leave as officers, are on trial on felony  charges of kidnaping and robbing a group of illegal aliens last August. If  convicted, they face life in prison.  </P> <P> However they insist that no kidnaping or robbery occurred. Instead, they say,  they simply followed department policies when they transported the three  illegal aliens out of downtown and dropped them off at secluded spots near the  San Diego Bay and along a row of railroad tracks.  </P> <P> Craig Rooten, the deputy district attorney who is prosecuting Hoff and Schaaf,  declined to comment about Breitenstein's presence in court. But asked if the  brouhaha appeared to be merely courtroom theatrics on the part of the defense  team, Rooten said: "Your perceptions are accurate."  </P> <P> One former police officer testified Monday that supervisors told patrolmen at  lineups to transport street people out of downtown because of complaints from  area merchants.  </P> <P> But several other officers -- who are still on the force -- were vague in their  testimony about the policy and appeared rather uncomfortable when asked to  discuss the roundup practice, all in front of Breitenstein.  </P> <P> At police headquarters Tuesday, officials were reluctant to discuss the roundup  policy, but planned to issue a public statement on the matter today.  </P> <P> "Anything that has to do with the trial, we're reserving comment," Lt. Greg  Clark said. "We don't want to say anything to jeopardize the trial in  progress."  </P> <P> However, Clark scoffed at any suggestion that the department was using  Breitenstein to spy on officers who took the stand as defense witnesses.  </P> <P> "I don't know why he's been there," Clark said. "But how can you be a spy in  open court? Come on. You answer me that."  </P> <P> Attempts to contact Breitenstein on Tuesday afternoon were unsuccessful.  </P></p>

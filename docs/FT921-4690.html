			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / Dehaene takes over as Belgian premier THE Christian Democrat Jean-Luc Dehaene was named prime minister of a new Belgian centre-left coalition government late yesterday, ending a 103-day-old political impasse. King Baudouin confirmed him as head of government after the Christian Democrats and Socialists approved a government platform to control a runaway budget deficit and tackle urgent social problems. The Socialist Willy Claes was named foreign minister and the Christian Democrat Philippe Maystadt stays on as finance minister. Mr Dehaene replaces Mr Wilfried Martens, western Europe's longest-serving premier. A senior Flemish Christian Democrat like Mr Martens, he has coaxed Christian Democrats and socialists from both sides of the French-Flemish language divide into a coalition and was negotiating yesterday over further ministers. Mr Dehaene, 51, was vice-premier and communications minister in the last government. He worked out agreement on a coalition after the 1988 election, but his friend and patron Mr Martens was appointed to the top job, a post he has held almost continuously for nearly 13 years. Mr Martens, 55, could now take over as chairman of the Senate, Belgium's upper chamber, if he is not given a ministry. The new Belgian government will probably contain only 16 ministers, about half the usual number, charged with an emergency legislative programme. They will try to tackle further constitutional reform, the issue which brought down the last Martens government, but Mr Dehaene may also face problems here. The four coalition parties all lost seats in the election and political opponents are already calling this 'the government of the vanquished'. It will command 120 seats in the 212-seat parliament, and will have to curry favour with other parties to gain the two-thirds majority needed before further powers can be devolved to the Belgian regional authorities.</p>

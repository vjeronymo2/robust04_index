			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Red noses, red screens Yesterday's 37-point fall in the FT-SE 100 index injects a note of realism into UK equities. Unfolding events in Russia and Hong Kong, combined with a tumbling US equity market, provided the excuse. But the results season so far has been something of a mixed bag. Given the potential for upset in next week's Budget, and the continued flow of rights issues, good reasons for caution can be found closer to home. There are some striking contrasts in the latest crop of company results. Figures from companies as diverse as BAT Industries, BTR, and GKN proved well up with the market's best expectations. Companies which cut costs and maintained investment through recession now have the operational gearing to deliver earnings growth. There are notable exceptions. The Pounds 184m pre-tax loss and dividend cut announced by Rolls-Royce on Thursday was a reminder that sections of UK manufacturing are still fragile. Equally, Vickers and WPP are not last in the queue of companies hoping to repair damaged balance sheets with a rights issue. Selective buying, then, may be the best strategy. The strength of the FT-SE 100 index relative to small and medium-sized companies suggests that the blanket buying of cyclical stocks seen this winter has come to an end. That is not before time. There is still an outside chance the chancellor will be tempted into an early tightening of fiscal policy on Tuesday. If that was seen to prejudice the chances of recovery, companies travelling hopefully for the last six months will look vulnerable indeed.</p>

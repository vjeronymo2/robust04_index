			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / 'Reality' buries Vance-Owen plan LORD OWEN, one of the two international mediators for a peace settlement in Bosnia, yesterday pronounced the official funeral oration over the plan which he had co-authored with Mr Cyrus Vance and conceded that negotiations would now take place on the basis of a new plan to be put forward jointly by Serbia and Croatia. Referring to the latest proposals for the division of Bosnia-Hercegovina into three ethnically based mini-states representing the Serb, Moslem and Croat communities, linked to each other by a loose confederal constitution, Lord Owen said it would be 'quite dishonest' to try to sell this as the Vance-Owen plan. 'But time in Bosnia-Hercegovina doesn't just move on, it deteriorates,' Lord Owen said at an emotional joint news conference with his fellow mediator Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg. 'You have seen the provisional provincial map (an integral part of the Vance-Owen plan) torn up in front of your very eyes by all three parties in the last few months.' Given this deterioration in the situation on the ground, there was no point in going back to the past. Though Lord Owen did not pretend that the new plan would provide as equitable a solution, he made no apology for contemplating other ways of getting a peace settlement. 'I think there is a tiredness of the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina and I think most people believe we have got to bring it to an end with as much honour as possible. There won't be a lot of honour and there won't be anywhere near the sort of settlement that we would ideally have liked.' Both Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg urged the Moslems to look seriously at the new plan, which would give them a central Bosnian region between Sarajevo, Zenica and Tuzla and a separate area in the north-west of the country called Bihac. It would also give the Moslems access to a free port on the Adriatic, Ploce. The mediators denied reports that President Alija Izetbegovic had walked out in anger from his meeting with Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia in a villa near Geneva on Wednesday, at which the new plan was discussed. Mr Stoltenberg said Mr Izetbegovic had listened calmly to all that had been said and had undertaken to consult the other members of the mixed Bosnian presidency before making a final decision on the new Serbian-Croat proposals, which are due to be presented in detail in Geneva next Wednesday. Though Lord Owen conceded that he had failed in his mission of gaining acceptance for his plan, he did not despair of saving some of its essential elements. These included the demilitarisation of the country, which all the parties claim they accept, the monitoring of human rights and the organisation of free elections. 'I have not given up on getting the maximum degree of pluralistic democracy established in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' he said. The US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher, yesterday opened the door to Washington's acceptance of the partition of Bosnia, Reuter reports from Washington. Although he said the US continued to support UN resolutions endorsing Bosnia's territorial integrity he stressed that was 'our current position'. He noted that with new negotiations under way, 'it's a dynamic situation'.</p>

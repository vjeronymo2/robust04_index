			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Mosaic makes Pounds 10.4m disposal Mosaic Investments is to sell the bulk of its engineering and automotive division for Pounds 10.4m cash in a management buy out. The management team, comprising certain Mosaic subsidiary directors, is supported by equity funding arranged by Midland Montagu Ventures and co-underwritten by County NatWest Ventures. Mosaic said the sale would substantially reduce its current high level of borrowings and materially increase net assets. The engineering and automotive division consists mainly of Press Tools Holdings and T Turner, but Stainless Steel Services, which forms only a small part of the division, is not presently being sold. Although trading conditions generally continue to be difficult, Mosaic expects that results for the year to April 30 1992 - due late next month - will be in line with market expectations.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / We're in for a bumpy ride: The privatisation of British Rail poses unique problems and is fraught with difficulty It has been a long time coming. For years, on and off, successive Conservative governments have been talking about the possibility of privatising British Rail. Yesterday, at last, the bill that will make this possible appeared. But just what does railway privatisation mean? The passenger could be forgiven for being confused. The government white paper, New Opportunities for the Railways, that came out last July was subtitled The Privatisation of British Rail. But as we entered the new year, the prime minister described the process as 'semi-privatisation' and Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, followed up by developing a predilection for the word 'commercialisation'. Ministers denied gleeful Labour accusations of a U-turn: but amid the complexity of the government's proposals, it is not surprising that the public's understanding of what is really going to happen to its railways is at a low ebb. One thing that is plain about the privatisation of BR is that it will be like no other Britain has yet seen. Previous privatisations have typically involved the disposal of industries and utilities to the private sector through trade sales or stock market flotations. But this never looked feasible with BR. Loss-making on a big scale - last year it lost nearly Pounds 1bn - it would have been impossible to value, still less to sell. Who would have wanted to buy it? Having wrestled with a number of options for breaking up BR into smaller units, the government still kept coming up against the same problem. Whichever way you split the railway, there was no getting rid of the losses  -not, at least, without big cuts in services, large fare rises, or both. So, instead, it switched tack and looked at ways of involving the private sector through the contracting out of train operations, just as if they were hospital cleaning or rubbish collection services. And that, in essence, is what this privatisation amounts to. True, BR's freight operations are to be sold off - the government sees no reason to protect loss-making freight, and the profit-making operations can fend for themselves. But that is all that is going to be sold. So far as the rest of British Rail is concerned, it is to be split into two. One part, to be named Railtrack, will retain the tracks and infrastructure, and start charging for their use. The other will continue to operate the passenger trains, but these services will gradually be contracted out to the private sector on the basis of which company is prepared to pay the highest price for the franchise - or rather, since the majority of services are unprofitable, on the basis of which company requires the smallest subsidy. There is just one more wrinkle. Obsessed with the idea of maximising competition, and embittered by the experience of privatisations such as British Gas, where competition has been slow to emerge, the government is also requiring open access to the tracks. In other words, any company wanting to introduce a new freight or passenger service in competition with existing ones will theoretically be able to do so - though this is unlikely to take place on any widespread scale, given the shortage of vacant slots on BR's busiest routes. Put in these terms, privatisation may not sound such a troubling prospect. And yet the government's plans have been attacked from almost every quarter  -by politicians, consumer groups, trade unions, professional institutions, the public transport lobby and the very companies the government is hoping will participate. Roughly speaking, the criticisms fall into two main categories. Those in the first category say that the government's plans just will not work. So do those in the second category; but they go on to suggest that, even if the plans do work, the result will be to passengers' disadvantage. The criticisms in the first category have been better rehearsed than those in the second. To take a few examples: The government's insistence on open access will kill off private-sector interest in franchising because franchisees' most profitable services will be vulnerable to attack by cherry-picking marauders. Dividing the responsibility for track and trains makes no sense because it will leave too high a proportion of the train operator's costs under the control of state-owned Railtrack, which will have no incentive to act efficiently. The government's insistence that Railtrack must make a positive return on its assets will result in its imposing track charges so high as to price traffic off the railways and on to the roads. The complex bureaucracy involved in the relationship between the government, the rail regulator, the franchising authority, Railtrack, the BR residuary body, the Health and Safety Commission and the private-sector train operators will prove impossibly unwieldy. The first two of these have already been answered, at least in part. Earlier this week the government made a significant concession by acknowledging that it would have to deny open access in some franchise areas to persuade the private sector to get involved. It also said it was prepared to franchise the tracks as well as the trains on some routes. Criticisms of the track-charging regime are more difficult to answer because the government has yet to publish its proposals for track charges. As for the bureaucracy: well, that is just one of the unfortunate side-effects of trying to combine a competitive railway with a safe and reliable one, and it remains to be seen how offputting it proves in practice. But never mind the danger that privatisation will never happen, BR's passengers could say: the worst that can happen is that BR will simply go on running the trains. What we want to know is what will happen if privatisation does happen. How will we be affected? Will our trains still run? Will fares soar? Passengers appear to have genuine grounds for concern about the government's plans - many of them centring on the possible consequences of the fragmentation of the national passenger railway into a patchwork of independently operated franchises. A simple example is the national railway timetable. Admittedly, this is not one of Britain's best-selling publications: most railway passengers travel to and fro on a single route and have no need to know what other services BR offers. Nevertheless, it is useful for the minority of passengers who travel more widely, and looks a probable casualty of the government's privatisation plans. As for railway services, most should be safe from closure. Franchisees will still be receiving subsidies to operate loss-making services, so companies will not be able to drop them willy-nilly. When awarding franchises, the franchising authority will specify minimum levels and standards of services, and these seem likely to be no worse than those already being operated by BR, at least initially. Even so, some rural services could come under scrutiny. Take, for example, the line from Inverness to Wick in the far north of Scotland - a 161-mile railway carrying only three trains daily each way. With Railtrack charging the whole of the costs of operating the line to such a small amount of traffic, the subsidies required by the franchisee to run the service would be enormous. That would call into question the case for keeping the service going. But perhaps the biggest potential hazard from the passenger's point of view is the threat of fare increases. Superficially, this should not be an issue: the government has said that, on subsidised services (the large majority), maximum fare levels will be pegged by the franchising authority when awarding the franchises, and on the few profit-making services - mainly InterCity - tough competition from cars, coaches and aircraft should keep fares down. But again, it is the loss of the so-called network benefits that poses the greatest threat. By way of illustration, imagine a return trip from Southend-on-Sea in Essex to Glasgow. At present, the traveller can go to Southend station and book a discounted 'saver' return ticket for the complete journey for Pounds 76. But after privatisation, when the London Tilbury &amp; Southend line and the London-Glasgow line are operated by different franchisees, the traveller's cheapest option is likely to be the purchase of two separate tickets: a discounted return from Southend to London and a discounted return from London to Glasgow. At today's fare levels, that would cost Pounds 14.80 for the Southend-London leg and Pounds 69 for the London-Glasgow leg, totalling Pounds 83.80 - about 10 per cent more than the price of a through ticket. The government's response to this sort of criticism is that it has guaranteed the preservation of through ticketing. And so it has: but it has not guaranteed the preservation of discounted through ticketing, nor has it guaranteed the validity between franchisees of other discount schemes such as the senior citizen's railcard. Since 80 per cent of all tickets sold on BR are discounted in one way or another, the possible consequences for average fare levels could be far-reaching. Given the scale of the potential pitfalls, it is tempting to ask why the government should bother to take on a privatisation as troublesome as that of British Rail. After all, it can't be for the money: the proceeds will be next to nothing. And it will do nothing to advance the cause of popular capitalism, since no shares are being sold. Then again, consider the alternative: doing nothing. It is highly unlikely that the government will ever have enough money to provide railway passengers with the investment levels they would like. And even if it could, the railway would continue to be run by a management which seems incapable of delivering a standard of service that the public finds acceptable. At the end of the day, it all comes down to the government's claim that every privatisation so far has brought substantial benefits to the consumer. To an extent, one would have to acknowledge that to be true. But then again, the privatisation of BR is not like any other. It may yet prove an uncomfortable ride for the government and passengers alike.</p>

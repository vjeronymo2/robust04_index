			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Government Bonds: Europe stands back ahead of German rate decision EUROPEAN government bond markets were yesterday caught in the thrall of the German rate cut debate and held fast ahead of the first signals due today. Many economists expect a quarter-point reduction in the all-important German discount rate to 6.25 per cent, which could allow France to lower its 6.75 per cent intervention rate. It would also give other EC members, particularly Belgium, a chance to ease further. However, high money supply figures last week cast a shadow over the leeway that the members of the Bundesbank Council will have when they return from their summer break for Thursday's meeting. Analysts are waiting keenly to see whether Germany's repo auction on Wednesday will be fixed at 6.8 per cent or variable. If the latter, the repo could rise slightly, increasing the gap with the discount rate. The first regional inflation figure is also expected today and could provide an opportunity for easing if it points to a national figure of less than 3 per cent on a three-month annualised basis. German government bond futures on Liffe rose 9 basis points to 97.07. FRENCH debt prices marked time despite the suspension of the emergency 24-hour lending facility set up to counter the wave of franc selling that led to the broadening of the ERM bands at the beginning of the month. The standard five-day to 10-day lending rate remained at a punishingly high 10 per cent but is expected to fall to the final 24-hour level of 7.75 per cent shortly. French 10-year futures closed two basis points firmer at 122.16. However, the balance of strength was on the shorter end of the yield curve which is more sensitive to interest rate cuts. IN the UK, gilts were firm at the long end, but the sustained rally of recent weeks appeared to lose some impetus. With no significant domestic data or political factors to concentrate on, dealers waited to see what would happen in Germany. Long gilt futures were up  3/32 at 112 15/16 by the close but the support was not there and turnover was just over a paltry 14,500 contracts. HIGH-yielding markets were enlivened by a rate cut and encouraging inflation data. Spanish Bonos futures lifted more than half a point to 97.59 after the central bank announced a one-point reduction in its intervention rate. Although not significant in itself economists said the cut heralded an easing in the repo today from its present 10.57 per cent. In Italy, government bonds responded to the latest consumer prices data that represented encouraging year-on-year inflation of 4.4 per cent, unchanged from the official July figure. They also bounced from a sharp technically inspired fall late last week. Italian bond futures on Liffe lifted half a point to around 111.44. Portuguese bonds, especially long maturities, closed higher on strong demand from local investors who foresaw foreign buying later as interest rates fall. DANISH bonds reacted to a half-point cut in the central bank's 14-day certificate of deposit rate to 10.5 per cent - the first since early August's ERM changes. Short-term bonds lifted with 9.25 per cent two-year paper rising 0.25 point to 104.75. But the cut failed to impact on longer-term paper - the key 8 per cent Danish state bond due 2003 closed five basis points lower at 108.87 on profit-taking. US TREASURY prices eased slightly yesterday in listless trading. By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  5/32 at 100 11/32 , yielding 6.222 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was down  1/32 at 100 9/16 , to yield 3.927 per cent. Trading was extremely quiet, primarily because this is the most popular week on Wall Street for holidays. In the absence of fresh economic news, the market's attention was focused on upcoming supply, although there were reports of continued buying of bonds from overseas investors before New York opened. On the supply front, the Treasury is due to auction Dollars 16bn of two-year notes today, followed by Dollars 11bn of five-year notes tomorrow. Traders said that the short-end of the market eased slightly yesterday in anticipation of the auctions. Lazards, Barclays and James Capel have won the mandate to lead manage a Dollars 100m Euro convertible issue for Shipping Credit and Investment Corporation of India, writes R. C. Murthy in Bombay. Essar Gujarat floated a Euro convertible with put option, which attracted investors. Shipping Credit is expected to allow a similar put option to its Euro convertible scheduled for launch in October.</p>

			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Business Travel: More Choice in ex-Soviet states One hotel group with far-ranging plans in Russia and elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent States is the US-based Choice Hotels International. Alain Ammar, its managing director in Europe, says that the CIS offers 'great potential' for western hotel groups, because of a lack of international two-, three- and four-star properties, writes Michael Thompson-Noel. However, the group's first Russian property will be a 272-unit, five-star, city-centre hotel in the Petrogradskaya district of St Petersburg, close to the Hermitage museum, which will be marketed primarily to international business travellers. The former Inter Hotel Petrograd is receiving a Dollars 60m facelift, due to be completed by next autumn. It will reopen as the Clarion North Crown, complete with 10 suites, two-room apartments, a business centre, conference hall, nightclub and shopping mall. Room rates will be Dollars 250-Dollars 280 a night. Choice Hotels International is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Manor Care, the US healthcare group, and describes itself as the world's largest international hotel franchise business. It has 3,265 properties open or being developed in 34 countries, which it markets under seven brands. Four brands are used internationally: Clarion, Quality, Comfort and Sleep Inn. The other three - Econo Lodge, Rodeway and Friendship Inn - are used only in the US and Canada. Four months ago, Choice signed an agreement with Contract Russia, a leading hotel development and management company in the CIS. The agreement covers 15 CIS countries and envisages the development of 25 hotels under the Choice umbrella by the end of 1998, and about 70 within 10 years. Its main target is the two- and three-star segment. Properties will be developed via a mix of conversions and new building, concentrating initially on Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. The early priorities are St Petersburg, Moscow and Minsk. After that, says Choice, will come Novisibirsk, a Siberian city, and Kazakhstan, the oil-and-mineral-rich republic whose capital, Alma-Ata, already attracts business visitors. Choice says that so far this year it has opened 35 hotels in seven western European countries, including Spain, a new market, and has 58 more under development in Britain, France, Germany, Norway and Portugal. As of last week it had 250 hotels open or being readied in 10 European countries. Contract Russia, based in Moscow, is a subsidiary of Contract Mullersafe Industrie, a Russian financial holding company with interests in engineering, construction, industrial equipment, sales and distribution, and hotel development and management. St Petersburg, which is expected to attract 3.5m visitors next year, has about 30,000 hotel beds. But fewer than 3,000 of the city's hotel rooms, says Choice, are up to international standard.</p>

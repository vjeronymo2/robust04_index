			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / International Capital Markets: Toyota lifts forecast despite yen's advance Toyota Motor, the leading Japanese carmaker, has revised upwards its profit forecasts for the first half to December in spite of the yen's appreciation. Mr Tatsuro Toyoda, president, said aggressive cost cutting would lift unconsolidated operating and recurring profits, before extraordinary items and tax, to 10 per cent above the original interim forecast. Non-consolidated recurring profits for the interim period are now expected to rise 74.3 per cent from the previous year to Y145bn (Dollars 1.44bn) while operating profits are estimated to increase nine-fold to Y85bn. The cost-cutting helped cover the Y30bn foreign exchange loss which had arisen as a result of the company basing its initial forecasts on a yen/dollar rate of Y103, against the actual Y98 through the July-December period. Mr Toyoda was confident about the company's domestic sales and overseas manufacturing. He forecast that domestic sales in the year to next December would climb 10 per cent from a year earlier to 2.24m vehicles, after falling 1 per cent this year to 2.04m. Overseas production, which rose 19 per cent to 1.05m units this year, is expected to increase by 18 per cent to 1.25m in 1995.</p>

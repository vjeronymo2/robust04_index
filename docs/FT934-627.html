			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / International Company News: Flight operations hold back Swissair Swissair will make a small consolidated profit again this year, in spite of suffering a large loss on its flight operations for the fourth consecutive year. The company's forecast was slightly more optimistic than that made in the summer when the Swiss national airline said it would be difficult to break even this year. Mr Otto Loepfe, chief executive, said in a newsletter to staff that results in September and October were 'pleasing,' with the load factor reaching 70.6 per cent in October. Nevertheless, prices remained depressed and a 'massive loss' would again be recorded on airline operations. Only substantial proceeds from aircraft sales and profits from subsidiaries would make possible the overall group profit. Last year, the group made a SFr113m (Dollars 75.80m) net profit, due to SFr179m from aircraft sales. Following the collapse last month of the Alcazar negotiations aimed at merging Swissair and three other medium sized European airlines, Mr Loepfe said the group approved SFr211m in new capital spending on buildings and installations. He said the airline would concentrate on strengthening its existing alliances with Delta Air Lines of the US, Singapore Airlines, Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airlines System.</p>

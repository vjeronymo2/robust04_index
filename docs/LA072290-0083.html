			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO EVOLUTION MEANS TRAVELING CAMCORDERS NO LONGER FORCED TO PLAY THE ROLE OF  HEAVY  </P> <P> Time was when home video stayed home.  </P> <P> The early video cameras were bulky, two-piece affairs that prompted bystanders  to wave in the background and ask what channel they were going to be on.  </P> <P> Today, however, is the era of the two-pound, one-piece camcorder that fits in a  large handbag yet packs more features than some studios offered a decade ago.  </P> <P> With plenty of options available -- tapes alone come in six formats -- a  vacationer should talk with a knowledgeable salesperson before buying a  camcorder and heading out of town.  </P> <P> Gregg Burger of Samy's Camera in Los Angeles points out that camcorders using  the VHS format are the number-one sellers. That's no surprise, considering VHS  is the most popular format for home videocassette players.  </P> <P> But he adds that the popularity of VHS is waning. "VHS' biggest drawback is its  size and weight," he said. "We ask customers what their use will be."  </P> <P> The most highly recommended camcorders are those that capture the clearest  image in the lightest and smallest package. But convenience of playback is  another consideration. A bulkier, less-expensive camcorder is more likely to be  compatible with the cassette player you already own.  </P> <P> Following are the main tape formats:  </P> <P>  -- VHS and Super VHS. Super offers 66% greater resolution. Both types of  cassette run for two hours and can be played on most home VCRs.  </P> <P>  -- VHS-C and Super VHS-C. "C" stands for compact. The cassettes are less than  half the size of VHS but run only 20 minutes. Both adapt easily to play on most  home VCRs.  </P> <P>  -- Eight-millimeter and Hi-8. The cassettes are the same size as VHS-C but  offer two-hour recording and slightly better resolution. They cannot be adapted  to play on most home VCRs. However, with a simple cable, the 8-millimeter or  Hi-8 camcorder can be plugged directly into a TV set for playback. (The same  can be done with VHS and VHS-C camcorders.)  </P> <P> Newer TVs with better resolution are best for Hi-8 play. For either  8-millimeter or Hi-8 you can buy a special cassette player, but, honestly,  you're better off saving your money for vacation.  </P> <P> Burger's cut-to-the-basics recommendation:  </P> <P> "For quality, weight and size, buy regular 8 or Hi-8. There are more than 30  camcorders to choose from, from $699 up to $2,500. Hi-8 is the best bet, with  new televisions capable of showing more lines of resolution. But if your TV is  old, put the extra money into accessories."  </P> <P> Ah, accessories . . .  </P> <P> Buyers' foremost concerns reflect the effectiveness of advertising. Auto-focus,  power zooms with long ranges, high-speed shutters and super-impose capabilities  are all features that customers demand.  </P> <P> But Burger says some questions reflect more advertising knowledge than  technical familiarity. "People ask how many 'pixels' a camcorder will have. Or  they'll ask what is the 'lux' level. What they know is that the higher the  pixels the better, and the lower the lux the better."  </P> <P> A pixel is a "picture element," the dots that make up the image on the screen.  Lux is a measure of light intensity under very specific conditions. The more  pixels, the greater the contrast and definition on the screen, while low lux  numbers reflect a camera's ability to record an image in low light.  </P> <P> Among the many manufacturers, both Sony and Canon offer a full line of  8-millimeter camcorders. Both make their own equipment to cover a broad price  range. And both offer purse-size lightweight cameras.  </P> <P> Sony's TR-5 weighs just under two pounds (all weights are quoted without  battery or tape).  </P> <P> Canon's equivalent E06 weighs two pounds. Both feature 6-1 zoom lenses, auto  focus and auto-exposure. But expect a premium price for the miniaturization.  Sony's TR-5 sells for $999, while Canon's EO6 costs $1,299.  </P> <P> The difference? Canon's has stereo sound recording, a "FlexiGrip" viewfinder  and a wireless remote controller, enabling the user to put himself in the video  more creatively.  </P> <P> If you're willing to lug a few more ounces, prices drop. Canon's low-end E51  sells for $899. But it still has the remote controller, stereo sound and  FlexiGrip. Sony's version is the F33 at $799. But the Sony zooms out to a wider  view without accessory lenses. The Sony weighs 2 pounds 10 ounces, the Canon 2  pounds 7 ounces.  </P> <P> Mid-range, both companies' 8-millimeter camcorders get intensely creative with  features. Sony's F77 (2 pounds 10 ounces; $1,295) has an 8-1 zoom, stereo  sound, programmable "exposure" ("sports" switches to a higher shutter speed to  freeze the action crisply, while "portrait" softens background focus to center  interest on the subject), freeze frames, slo-mo, super-impose functions (which  allow you to copy a title, put it in memory and then call it up for recording  when the scene matches the title), a wireless remote control and a  through-the-lens auto-focus system.  </P> <P> Canon's E808 (2 pounds 11 ounces; $1,449) offers a similar 8-1 zoom, FlexiGrip,  remote controller, a built-in title-maker and high-speed shutters for sports  video. Canon's auto focus uses an infra-red system that reacts more quickly and  is more accurate in very low light.  </P> <P> At the high end, numerous features make virtually anything possible. Sony  offers the V101 Hi-8 (replacing the V99, which was the first Hi-8 camcorder).  </P> <P> Priced at $1,559, the Sony Hi-8 (2 pounds 10 ounces) produces 410,000 pixels.  Four auto-exposure modes provide sport and portrait settings, as well as  shutter or aperture priorities just like sophisticated 35-millimeter cameras.  </P> <P> Canon, not to be outdone, has just introduced a most-unusual-looking Hi-8  machine, the A1 Mk II. At $1,888, the Canon (3 pounds, 5 ounces) features 10-1  zoom, seven shutter speeds and all the rest, matching Sony's 410,000 pixels.  </P> <P> But before you head for the airport, be sure to test all your equipment  thoroughly.  </P> <P> Charge the batteries (always carry a spare), make a tape, try some titles,  shoot some sports and some portraits, and shoot in the dark. Then pack extra  blank tapes. Better to have too many than too few.  </P> <P> Now sling that two-pound-something camcorder over your shoulder, just where the  snappy 35-millimeter camera used to hang, and start making pictures that move  and speak.  </P></p>

			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Tough times ahead for the fund raisers COMPANIES are expected to face some of their toughest challenges of the recession in 1993 as they seek to finance recovery, according to Robert Fleming, the merchant bank. In its review of 1992, published yesterday, Flemings Corporate Finance warned that the government's need to fund its growing deficit would absorb an increasing proportion of institutional funds. 'Until this changes,' the report states, 'institutional cash flow will remain under pressure, companies will be strapped for cash and banks reluctant to lend.' Seekers of equity finance raised just Pounds 4bn in 1992, less than 40 per cent of the record level in 1991. However, Flemings expected 'substantial cash raisings' in 1993 as stronger companies sought development finance. 'Recent issues provide grounds for optimism that the market may be willing to provide funding for acquisition and development, although it is equally clear that such capital is less easily available,' the report states. The scarcity of equity finance, combined with lower interest rates, might well promote an increased interest in debt financing, according to Ms Liz Holt of Flemings Corporate Finance. The decline in interest rates had already made debt much more competitive in comparison with the costs of servicing equity - ie, the amount paid in dividends. Again, however, companies would have to compete for scarcer loan funds as banks are increasingly reluctant to lend. Flemings said the most vulnerable would be smaller companies. 'Smaller companies continue to find life disproportionately more difficult than their larger counterparts.' Sectors that have fallen out of favour, such as heavy capital goods, will emerge from the recession hungry for funding. However, the markets may be unwilling or unable to meet their needs. Responding to the report's findings, Mr Robert Cooper, chief executive of Flemings Corporate Finance, suggested that a more creative approach to equity finance could ease the financing burden. Flemings was architect of the Pounds 2.16bn sale of 270m Wellcome shares last summer, which was achieved by a book-building method unusual in the UK. Mr Cooper urged the Stock Exchange to promote the liberalisation of domestic capital markets, thus making 'more unusual forms of equity raising available to a broader spread of companies'. The report also suggested that merger and acquisition activity continued to decline because of the increasing focus on better utilisation of existing resources rather than diversification. Over the last 12 months, the report found that corporate profitability had continued to decline, activity was low and industrial confidence further eroded. Cash generation, however, had begun to improve.</p>

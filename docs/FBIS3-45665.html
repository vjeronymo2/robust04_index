			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Pu Liye (5543 4539 2814) and Zhao Lianqing </F> (6392 6647 1987)]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Jan (XINHUA) -- Thanks to efforts  exerted by leading authorities and the hundreds of millions of  peasants in the country, China's agricultural and rural economy  continued to grow in 1993. According to information recently  released by the State Statistics Bureau, even though the  nation's total sown acreage in 1993 was smaller than that of a  year before, the nation's total grain output in 1993 reached  456.4 billion kg, topping the previous record by 10.2 billion  kg, and the average per-mu yield increased by eight kg. The  substantial per-unit increase was unusual in recent years.    Last year, to provide stronger leadership over agriculture  and rural affairs, the CPC Central Committee and the State  Council called a series of meetings to promulgate grain  production and marketing policies, to promote grain sales, to  examine development of township and town enterprises in central  and western China, and to review the situation of cotton  production and rural affairs. They also put forth many effective  measures for encouraging grain and cotton production, reducing  peasants' burdens, and making sure "IOU's" were not issued in  lieu of cash payments for agricultural purchases. Following the  central authorities' guidelines, all local governments strove to  do everything possible to reduce peasants' burdens; to increase  agricultural investment in terms of capital, supplies, and  technical expertise; and to strengthen the role of agriculture  as the foundation of the national economy. Their efforts as  well as the good weather facilitated the bumper harvests and the  sustained economic growth in rural areas.    According to the Ministry of Agriculture, except for the  output of cotton and sugar, which registered a decline, the  output of all other agricultural goods and nonstaple foods  continued to increase last year: The total output of  oil-bearing crops reached 17.61 million tonnes, topping the  previous record by 1.2 million tonnes; and people's greater  demands for nonstaple foods were ensured with the increased  supply of meat, dairy goods, eggs, and acquatic products, the  total output of which were expected to top that of the year  before by 5.5, 6.4, 7.0, and 10.0 percent respectively. As the  pillar of the rural economy, township and town enterprises, in  addition to maintaining their strong developmental momentum,  registered growth in both output and returns last year. It is  expected that the sales of the nation's township and town  enterprises would reach 2.6 trillion [wan yi 8001 0310] yuan,  the total profit taxes they paid reached 255 billion yuan, and  the total output reached 2.9 trillion yuan last year, or a 40  percent growth from those of the year before in all three cases.  What is even more eye-catching is the fact that the total value  of export goods which township and town enterprises had  delivered reached 190 billion yuan, topping that of the year  before by 60 percent, or approximately 45 percent of the goods  which the nation purchased for export. Owing to the boom in all  rural sectors and broader channels for peasants' production,  peasants' net per capita income last year was expected to reach  880 yuan. Allowing for inflation, the increase will be about  two percent over that of the year before.    The features of agricultural production in various parts of  the country last year were greater efforts for restructuring the  agricultural pattern to accommodate market needs, as well as the  noticeable high output of products of good quality and high  returns. Last year was the first year in which all sectors of  the nation's agricultural production moved toward the market,  and the hundreds of millions of peasants planned their  production according to market needs instead of following the  state's mandatory plans as before. In addition to expanding the  acreage for economic crops, peasants in various parts of the  country also readjusted the varieties of cereal crops, and  expanded the acreage of crops which yielded higher returns and  had promising market prospects. According to the Ministry of  Agriculture, in 1993 the acreage of early nonglutinous rice of  poor quality was downsized by more than 12 million mu and the  acreage of rice of good quality was expanded to more than 100  million mu, or over 30 percent of the total rice acreage; the  acreage of quality wheat was expanded to more than 16 million  mu, or over three million mu more than the year before; and the  acreage of soybean and other minor miscellaneous cereal crops  was expanded by 20 percent, exceeding 34 million mu. Meanwhile,  the breeding of well-known, special, quality, new, and rare  products developed quickly.    An official of the Ministry of Agriculture said that certain  factors, which should not be ignored, are still obstructing  China's agricultural and economic development. The most  conspicuous problems are: Low returns from agricultural  production, especially grain and cotton production, widening gap  between yields from industrial and agricultural goods, and  sluggish increase in peasants' income; incompatibility between  the development and popularization of agricultural techniques on  the one hand and the requirement for faster agricultural growth  on the other; growing needs for jobs as a result of the annual  increase of over 10 million able-bodied individuals in rural  areas; and the state's imperfect macroeconomic regulation and  control over agriculture, undeveloped rural systems of economic  information, and the lack of a fast and efficient market  guidance for agricultural production. To expedite development  of the market economy in rural areas, the vast number of cadres  and masses are now looking for solutions to these problems while  deepening reform.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUSTICES REJECT FORCED DRUG TESTS OF WORKERS;  </P> <P> NARCOTICS: JUSTICES LET STAND APPELLATE RULINGS THAT SAID EMPLOYEES CANNOT BE  MADE TO TAKE RANDOM TESTS.  </P> <P> In a severe blow to drug testing in the workplace, the state Supreme Court on  Thursday rejected attempts by employers to force workers to submit to random  tests to detect the use of illicit substances.  </P> <P> The justices, in a brief order, let stand two appeals-court rulings that  declared the state constitutional right to privacy protects employees from  being dismissed solely for refusing to submit to random drug tests.  </P> <P> In both instances, the lower court held that the state privacy guarantee  applies not only to governmental actions but also to private employers.  </P> <P> In one case, a state Court of Appeal in San Francisco held that a worker in a  non-safety-related job could not be required to take such a test and upheld a  $485,042 damage award to a computer programmer who refused to provide a  company-ordered urine sample.  </P> <P> In the other case, a state Court of Appeal in San Bernardino allowed a chemical  firm employee to sue for wrongful dismissal after he declined to submit to an  eye-pupil reaction test to determine whether he was under the influence of  drugs. Neither ruling applied to job applicants.  </P> <P> The high court action, taken without dissent, makes both appellate rulings  binding on trial courts statewide. Specialists in employment law said that as a  result, employers, in order to have a legally valid program, will have to  provide more specific reasons for testing -- such as an employee's involvement  in an accident or work in a safety- or security-related job. One attorney said  the action sounded the "death knell" for random drug tests.  </P> <P> The justices' refusal to hear employer challenges to the appellate rulings came  as something of a surprise. The court, now led by a moderately conservative  majority, has proved much more receptive to business concerns than its  liberal-dominated predecessor under former Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird.  </P> <P> Moreover, recent surveys have shown a steady growth in mandatory drug testing  imposed on both employees and job applicants. A study released last week showed  that 12.1% of a sampling of current employees in California tested positive for  drug use. In sharp contrast, only 3.5% of the workers in the 49 other states  tested positive.  </P> <P> Thursday's action marked the second time the justices have sidestepped an  opportunity to formally review and issue their own opinion on the volatile  drug-testing issue. Last March, the high court left intact another appellate  decision allowing drug and alcohol tests of job applicants, who, the appeals  panel found, have less reasonable expectation of privacy than regular  employees.  </P> <P> The high court's order Thursday was hailed as being of "monumental importance"  by Mark S. Rudy of Oakland, attorney for Barbara A. Luck, the programmer who  successfully pursued a wrongful-termination suit against the Southern Pacific  Transportation Co.  </P> <P> "This means that an employer cannot use an employee's poor performance or mere  suspicion of drug use as grounds for testing," Rudy said. "There will have to  be some 'compelling interest' for the employer -- a very high legal standard --  such as an accident, a safety-related job or probable cause to believe there is  drug use."  </P> <P> Henry F. Telfeian of San Francisco, a lawyer for Southern Pacific, said the  action had provided the "the death knell" for drug-testing programs in  California.  </P> <P> "Employers are going to be extremely reluctant to institute drug testing except  where they have probable cause or consent from a worker -- and even then, such  programs may be of doubtful validity," Telfeian said. "It's a bad decision by  the Supreme Court not to take up this issue. The court owed it to employers to  consider this matter."  </P> <P> Richard Bradley, vice president of the 4,000-member Merchants and Manufacturers  Assn., said it appeared that employers still could impose carefully tailored  testing programs. But nonetheless, he said, he was disappointed by the high  court's refusal to review the issue.  </P> <P> "This country is having a real problem determining policy on illegal drugs,"  Bradley said. "If we want to stop people from using drugs, it seems logical to  do so in the employment situation. Most employers are not trying to be  punitive. If an employee has a drug problem, they want him to get into a  treatment program."  </P> <P> In the Luck case, the appellate court said that without a proven and direct  link to safety, an employer is barred by the state constitutional right to  privacy from requiring employees to submit to drug tests. The company, the  panel said, had not shown a "compelling interest" that would justify an  intrusion on privacy rights.  </P> <P> In its appeal to the high court, Southern Pacific contended that drug testing  was a legally valid and successful device to improve workplace safety and  efficiency. The company cited a recent study estimating that 25% of the work  force aged 20 to 40 are under the influence of illegal drugs while on the job.  </P> <P> In the second case before the court Thursday, James Semore, a production worker  for Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., in Trona, Calif., was fired after refusing a  pupil-reaction test.  </P> <P> A Superior Court judge in San Bernardino County dismissed the suit but a state  Court of Appeal reinstated it last February. The appellate court said that when  a private employee is dismissed for rejecting a random test, he may sue the  employer for violating his right to privacy.  </P> <P> The appeals court said that firing an employee for refusing an intrusion on  privacy rights violates the "public policy." Such a finding, which was not made  by the panel in the Luck case, could open the way for large damage awards  against employers.  </P> <P> In other action Thursday, the justices:  </P> <P> Unanimously reversed the conviction and death sentence of Duane Holloway, now  28, for the murders of two Sacramento sisters, Diane Pencin and Debra Cimmino,  in 1983. Holloway was entitled to a retrial, the court said, because a trial  juror, violating the judge's admonition, had read news accounts of the case.  The story at issue indicated Holloway had been on parole after attacking  another woman with a hammer. The judge had denied use of the previous  conviction as evidence because of its potentially prejudicial effect on jurors.  </P> <P> Agreed to review an appellate court ruling that the state Department of Motor  Vehicles had misapplied tax laws and must pay refunds to 17 million used-car  owners. Officials say the decision, unless overturned, could cost the state  $1.4 billion.  </P> <P> Said they would decide whether the state Fair Employment and Housing Commission  has authority to award damages for emotional distress in cases involving racial  discrimination. At issue is a Court of Appeal ruling that struck down a  commission award of $50,000 to a black Contra Costa County man who contended he  was denied an apartment because of his race.  </P></p>

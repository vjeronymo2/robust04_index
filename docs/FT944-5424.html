			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / Minding Your Own Business: Hoping for a pot of gold - Partners who are winning orders for their stoneware It had been a long, dull, miserable February Sunday in St Ives, Cornwall, and they had not made a single sale. Sarah Butler and Martin Clark were about to close the pottery shop and go home when a couple with Italian accents walked through the door. The man expressed approval, and after asking a number of questions bought Pounds 100 worth of their hand-thrown stoneware. The two young potters could not believe their luck - particularly when their visitor introduced himself as Vittorio Radice, managing director of Habitat UK, and that he would like to buy 400 of the three of their designs he liked best. Butler and Clark went for a celebratory drink. It was a rare moment of luxury after five months of hard slog, low sales and anxiety about what lay in store during the rest of their first year's trading. A few days later Radice phoned and increased his order to 1,200 examples of three of their designs of white stoneware vases. The order was worth Pounds 9,600 - almost two thirds of their first year's turnover. The BC Pottery completed its first year in October. Although it had turned over a mere Pounds 15,000 it had shown a good profit - Pounds 8,500. The figures were far better than either Butler or Clark had believed possible at the onset of their enterprise. The downside was that they had paid themselves only Pounds 1,500 each. 'It has been a very frugal existence,' said Butler, 25. 'But we have enough money to see us through to our next order and there are not a lot of things we want.' Clark, 24, agrees. 'It's been worth it,' he said. 'But a holiday sometime would be nice.' At the end of a day that frequently lasts 12 hours, the two bid each other farewell and return to their bedsits. It is an arrangement that suits them. They have little energy for socialising - even meeting other artists and craftspeople in the Cornish town that houses 40 galleries. 'Really the whole of our first year has been given over to potting. We are very lucky to be here. Throwing pots is very tiring and at present we are investing everything in the future of the business,' Clark said. In March 1993 the couple produced a business plan that convinced the Cornwall Enterprise Trust to approve their individual applications for a Pounds 1,500 12-month business start-up grant. Members of the interview panel were impressed by the quality of sample pots. The fact that Clark and Butler had known each other since their school days in Hertfordshire, also convinced the panel that the personal chemistry between them was likely to lead to business success. Members of the panel also noted that Clark, who left school after GCSE 0-Levels, had worked as a sales assistant for two years for the John Lewis Partnership's store in Oxford Street, London. During that time the company had funded him for one day a week to pursue a BTEC qualification, which he gained in Business Studies. Butler has an honours degree in English and Art. With a guaranteed company income of Pounds 3,000 for the first 12 months the couple formed a legal partnership and took a small Victorian shop unit in a narrow side street behind the harbour in St Ives. The rent was - and still is - Pounds 35 a week. For a few extra pounds their landlord, a local solicitor, allowed them to throw pots in an upstairs room until they managed to find separate premises for a studio. 'It was an ideal arrangement for the first three months while we built up our range,' said Clark. 'It was cheap, and as we could only afford one wheel at that stage, only one of us could throw at a time. The other one would man the shop. At times trade was very quiet - we took barely more than Pounds 400 in our first month. 'But it is very important to a potter to have time to read up about different techniques, shapes and glazes, and that can take place in the shop. Besides, a good potter must spend time away from the wheel.' The two have never regretted the decision to invest in a shop, even after they realised they were one of only two potteries in St Ives to have a shop frontage. 'The panel that interviewed us for our business start-up grant endorsed this view. We certainly would not have achieved the vital breakthrough with Habitat without the shop being there,' said Butler. After the Habitat order, the pair, who had originally financed the business on Pounds 1,000 of joint savings plus a Pounds 1,000 loan from Clark's parents, made their first approach to the banks. On the basis that they took out a monthly insurance premium of Pounds 10 to cover the risk, the local branch of Lloyds bank advanced them the Pounds 2,800 needed to buy a new kiln and a second potter's wheel. They repaid the loan within four months. In August, the head of design at Habitat chose another 15 designs, from which Butler and Clark made samples. Of these, six have been chosen to appear in next year's spring and summer Habitat range. In addition there is a chance that BC Pottery small mugs and cappucino cups will also be part of the range, and the pair has also been asked by the store to make 12 sample lamp bases. 'We believe we were chosen because the Habitat buyers like the finish of our pots, which differ from many others as they have a preliminary firing before glazing. In some stores friends tell us we even have a small display devoted to our pots,' says Butler. 'We are currently working flat out in our studio in a converted fishermen's store producing 120 pots a week of the six designs ordered by Habitat, plus the lamp bases, as well as trying to extend our range. 'St Ives in winter is an ideal place in which to work. The light is wonderful and there are many peaceful coastal walks that provide a liberating atmosphere. All we want is the opportunity to carry on in the same way.' BC Pottery, 2 Street An-Pol, St Ives, Cornwall TR26 2DS. 0736-795005.</p>

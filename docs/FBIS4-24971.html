			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Julian Brutus] </F>   [Text] Hundreds of thousands of tonnes of oil and  petroleum products are entering southern China despite a blanket  ban on crude-related imports. Traders estimate at least 500,000  tonnes (4.4 million barrels) of fuel oil arrived in the country  in May alone and a similar amount is expected this month. The  state-owned giant, Unipec, which distributes oil products,  including diesel and petrol, is one of the key importers along  with independent traders, according to Hong Kong analysts and  traders.    Mainland authorities decreed a two-month ban on imports of  oil and petroleum at the start of May in a bid to reimpose  central control on the sector and push down rising inflationary  pressures. The key area of concern was a growing number of  independent operators importing oil products for speculative  purposes and selling it at vastly inflated prices.    But the ban aimed at choking off these independent oil  traders, appears to be regularly flouted by the state companies,  independents and some large multinational oil companies with a  steady flow of products still reaching the mainland.  "Originally, small lots (of diesel) were transported in barges  up the Pearl River," one source said. "But last week we heard  of consignments of 10,000-20,000 metric tonnes being ordered.  The larger quantities will probably be supplied by the majors."    Traders at several independent Hong Kong-based companies  estimate that up to 40,000 tonnes of diesel alone entered China  since the curb was imposed. The most common method used by  independent companies to import crude products without official  permission is to persuade port officials to turn a blind eye to  the landing of a shipment. "In China, as in some other Third  World countries, a job at a customs posts is given out as a  reward with tacit approval for any extra income the official may  be able to manage," said a respected shipping commentator.    Shipments which are taken by pipeline to storage beyond port  boundaries do not have to be declared as having been landed at  the port. There are only a few ports in southern China where  this is possible, the chief ones being Shanghai, Guangzhou,  Ningbo, Xiamen, Maoming and Zhanjiang. All these ports are  capable of accommodating oil tankers, and have extensive storage  facilities.    Major international oil companies and the Hong Kong-based  independent companies supply the booming industries in the  Special Economic Zones (SEZs) on China's southern coast, which  rely on diesel to power their generators. Both groups say  diesel sales are increasing with most current Chinese  requirements planned for June delivery.    But why is Unipec ignoring the government ban? In a word,  expediency. "It seems there are exceptions to the ban," said  one source. "If a company in, say, Guangzhou, can demonstrate  that it has a requirement, the Government might say `sure, go  ahead'."    This is happening at the same time that Beijing maintains  domestic stocks of these products are already high, and that  importing them is a serious drain on the country's foreign  exchange. Stocks in the north of the country -- where oil is  produced -- do seem to be high, but the demand is in the south  and the infrastructure is too poor to transport it efficiently.    In any case, domestic production cannot match supply, and  the  Government relies on the industries in southern China to  generate foreign exchange. Imports of oil and products -- which  only began last year when burgeoning private enterprise  increased domestic demand many times over -- have played a large  part in China's alarming 1993 US$12.25 billion (about HK$94.5  billion) trade deficit.    Last year, for the first time, China became a net importer  of  oil and products. About 10 per cent of the 1.1 billion barrels  processed nationwide was bought on the spot market, mostly from  Australia and West Africa. This proportion is forecast to rise  dramatically this year. The Government has entered long-term  agreements with Middle East states and is considering doing the  same with Brunei.    In 1992, Sinochem -- China National Chemicals Import and  Export Corporation -- exported 20.87 million tonnes of crude  oil, and 4.28 million tonnes of oil products. In 1993, exports  of oil and products were virtually nil; imports of crude oil  were 14 million metric tonnes, and imports of products totalled  11 million metric tonnes. China's official imports of diesel in  1993 are put at 100,000 to 200,000 tonnes per month.    Increased imports are not entirely bad news for the  exchequer, however. On May 7 this year Beijing set new ceilings  for prices of domestic crude, diesel and petrol -- 900 yuan,  1,900 yuan and 2,430 yuan respectively -- virtually doubling the  existing prices and thereby bringing them closer to world spot  market prices. These prices allow the Government to buy on the  international spot market, add various taxes and then sell the  products on the domestic market at the new prices.    A Singapore-based trader said the current ban on imports  was aimed at the 200 to 300 independent Chinese companies that  had been importing shipments which they sold for big profits and  which had contributed to inflation. The first real casualties  of the current ban seem to be the major oil companies hoping for  a foothold in the Chinese market.    Beijing would like to limit the operations of foreign  companies, and the companies see the current ban as the latest  in a long list of difficulties they have to deal with. Recent  reports have outlined several reasons why these firms find  dealing with the mainland "a nightmare" and concluded by saying  that the "gifts" required by bureaucrats are growing and  therefore eating into profits. Oil companies were quoted as  "having taken enough".    Other problems include import bans, reneging on contracts,  price ceilings which have slashed profits and constantly  changing official policy. Privately, many companies have also  complained about the preferential treatment accorded to certain  joint ventures and companies.    Analysts say the Chinese energy sector needs the raw  materials, cash, expertise and technology that Western companies  can provide, but Beijing is obviously determined to have the  upper hand in all dealings. "The Chinese have a different  attitude to doing business," said one source. "Western  companies regard the signing for a contract as the end of a  process; the Chinese regard it as a beginning.    "This used to trouble me, but I have grown to accept it now;  it is the only way to continue doing business."    The agency report, however, makes it clear that the major  companies have run out of patience, as some of them find their  best efforts in China are resulting in losses instead of the  expected profits. At least three majors are engaged in lawsuits  worth more than US$1 million each against a Chinese company that  failed to honour spot deals.    Perhaps one should give Beijing the benefit of the doubt and  accept that the Western oil companies are incidental casualties;  after all, the Government's intention is to drive Chinese  independent companies out of business. According to a document  to be published soon, Beijing intends to buy up or close down  these companies.    Spokesmen from Sinopec and Unipec admit that independent  traders have succeeded in landing imports despite the previous  and current ban. The officials, who asked not to be named, said  that only small quantities of oil and products were involved,  and that the Government was not greatly concerned about the  problem.    The official view of the quantities concerned may well be  correct, but even if it does not make a significant impact on  the overall economy, it shows Beijing has less control of the  sector than it would like. "The Government may issue  directives," said another Singapore-based trader, "but whether  they will be carried out is another matter; connections play a  very large part in getting business done in China."    What are the prospects of success for the Government? "Hard  to say; I don't know enough about the mechanics of imposing  government wishes. But I think that if the Government can't  exercise more control over the energy sector they might as well  pack up," said the trader.    Analysts say China's economic growth requires the finance  and  expertise of foreign oil companies, and pulling out of the  country now would be foolhardy. The troubled state of the  domestic industry was highlighted two weeks ago when the Huabei  oil field near Beijing closed 21 inefficient wells and decided  to run another 34 only intermittently to save money.    China currently produces 1.2 million barrels per day of the  low- grade Daqing oil from Heilongjiang Province, and 600,000  barrels per day of slightly higher-grade Shengli from Shandong.  This is about 142 million tonnes annually. Offshore output is  expected to be 5.5 million tonnes this year.    On May 18, Beijing announced it had set aside 24 blocks of  land covering 294,00 square kilometres for oil exploration by  domestic companies. Two days later it opened 13 areas covering  40,000 sq km in the South China Sea for offshore exploration by  foreign companies. It was the first time China had invited bids  through acreage promotion, and the move was prompted by a lack  of funding and inadequate technology. Exploration, however, is  a notoriously long-term and uncertain operation.</p>

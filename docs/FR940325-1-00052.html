			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All members of a multiple resource advisory council would be required to attend training in the management of rangeland ecosystems to ensure a common understanding of many of the scientific, economic, social and legal considerations involved in managing public lands. The Colorado working group developed a proposal for a ``Range Ecosystem Awareness Program'' that would establish a basic curriculum that would include: basic rangeland ecology, human resource development, the relationship of public land resources to private lands and communities, and the pertinent laws and regulations affecting rangeland management. The Department intends to consider the Working Group's proposal in developing the curriculum for the training of advisory council members and invites public comment and suggestions on the content and structure of this required training. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department intends that multiple resource advisory councils would employ a consensus-building approach in developing recommendations for the BLM manager to whom they would report. To encourage this, the proposed rule would require that at least three council members from each of the three groupings of interests must be present to constitute an official meeting of a council, and at least three members from each of the three groupings of interest must be in agreement for a council to provide an official recommendation to the BLM official to whom the council reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Where a multiple resource advisory council has concerns that its advice is being arbitrarily disregarded, the council, upon agreement of all members, could request that the Secretary respond to such concerns within 60 days. This opportunity for direct communication with the Secretary is separate and distinct from the administrative appeals process and the Secretary's response would not constitute a decision on the merits of any issue that is or might become the subject of an administrative appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposed rule the multiple resource advisory councils could establish rangeland resource teams to enhance public and community-based involvement in public lands decision-making pertaining to livestock grazing. Rangeland resource teams would provide local level input to the multiple resource advisory council and would serve as fact-finding teams. The rangeland resource teams may, among other functions, provide input to the multiple resource advisory councils for grazing-related portions of land use plans and the planned expenditure of range improvement moneys. At the direction of the multiple resource advisory councils, rangeland resource teams may provide input and recommendations to the multiple resource advisory council for an area ranging from a single grazing allotment to the entire area under the jurisdiction of the multiple resource advisory council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the proposed rule, local citizens could petition the multiple resource advisory council to establish a rangeland resource team, or a rangeland resource team could be established by the multiple resource advisory council on its own initiative. Rangeland resource teams would have a minimal core membership that would include two resident permittees who hold Federal grazing permits or leases within the area for which input is sought, one resident at-large community representative, one environmental representative and one wildlife/recreation representative. For purposes of the proposal, in order to be a resident, an individual must have lived within the geographical area covered by the rangeland resource team for at least two years. The environmental representative and the wildlife/recreation representative could be nonresidents. However, all members would be required to demonstrate substantial knowledge and experience of the land and community where they serve. Nominations would be required to be accompanied by letters of recommendation from the local interests that the nominees will be representing. At least one member of the core group would also be a member of the multiple resource advisory council. All members of the rangeland resource team would be required to attend the training in the management of rangeland ecosystems required for members of the multiple resource advisory council. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the rangeland resource teams would provide local-level input, perform a fact-finding role and provide options and recommendations to the multiple resource advisory council, as opposed to serving in an advisory capacity to Federal land managers, it is anticipated that these groups would not be subject to the requirements of FACA. However, rangeland resource teams could petition the Secretary for recognition as advisory bodies under FACA. In such cases, the rangeland resource teams would be authorized to directly advise Federal land managers on matters pertaining to livestock grazing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rangeland resource teams would have opportunities to raise any matter of concern with the multiple resource advisory council and to request that the multiple resource advisory council form a technical review team, as described below, to provide information and options to the council for their consideration. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule provides that multiple resource advisory councils could establish technical review teams on an as-needed basis in response to requests of interested citizens, the authorized officer, or on their own motion. Technical review teams could also be established on an as needed basis by rangeland resource teams that have been chartered as FACA bodies. Technical review teams would be limited to tasks assigned by the multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team and would report to the parent committee. The technical review teams would consider specific issues for the purpose of providing local level input and serving as fact-finding teams. The technical review teams would not be subject to FACA because they will not be advising Federal officials. A technical review team would be dissolved by the parent committee upon completion of the assigned task. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Sharp drop in German orders A SHARP drop in orders for west German manufactured goods in December was an important indicator of the 'unstable' business climate, Mr Jurgen Mollemann, economics minister, said yesterday. But Mr Otmar Issing, a Bundesbank director, said later that he was not worried about the economic situation. The 2.5 per cent fall in real terms, announced yesterday, followed three months of flat demand, and added to the gathering concern about medium-term economic prospects. The week began with an inflationary 6.35 per cent pay award for steel workers, closely followed by news that the manufacturing production index had dropped almost four points in December. Then the government published figures which showed a surge in unemployment, taking the national jobless total to more than 3m. Mr Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, said the effects of Christmas holidays made it difficult to interpret industrial data. Domestic industrial orders fell 4 per cent in December, although there was some encouragement in a 0.5 per cent rise in export demand, the first increase since last July. The results for the full year showed an overall increase in orders of 0.4 per cent, thanks mainly to a rise in domestic demand of around 4 per cent, which cancelled out a 6 per cent decline in export markets. Most economic growth forecasts, recently down-graded, and suggesting a 1.5 per cent increase in GNP this year, assume falling domestic demand and a gradual increase in exports as foreign markets recover from recession. The government, Germany's largest employer, went on the offensive yesterday at the start of a crucial bout of pay negotiations with public service workers. Mr Rudolf Seiters, interior minister, said the 2.3m federal, state and local authority employees in west Germany could not expect an increase 'even approaching' last year's 6 per cent award. 'Everyone involved in these negotiations must be clear that we are not talking only about public servants' pay, but also about the stability of the D-Mark and the redevelopment of the new (eastern) federal states,' he said in an opening address. And he warned that 'recession would be almost unavoidable' if the conflict between monetary and pay policies sharpened. OTV, the main union, which has asked for 9.5 per cent and an extra DM550 (Pounds 191.60) holiday pay, promised 'bitter resistance' if the employers tried to turn the pay talks into a 'punishment mission' against its members. But Ms Monika Wulf-Mathies, the OTV leader, stressed her willingness to negotiate. 'Pay claims are not dictates', she said, urging the employers to make a negotiable offer quickly. Mr Seiters' aggressive speech, aimed also at the 350,000 railway and post office employees seeking the same deal as OTV, reflected concern in Bonn that last weekend's 6.35 per cent increase for steel workers has been adopted as this year's 'guideline'.</p>

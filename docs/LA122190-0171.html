			<p><P> December 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> LIZ SMITH: JAPANESE ELECTRONICS COMPANIES PLUG INTO HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> PEOPLE ARE talking about two Hollywood stories, one in the Wall Street Journal,  the other in M Inc. Both deal with Sony of Japan's U.S. company, Columbia.  </P> <P> The WSJ asks if Columbia's Tri-Star production of "Hook" (the tale of Peter Pan  grown up) will fly.  </P> <P> CAA, which represents Steve Spielberg, Dustin Hoffman and Robin Williams, the  principals, made a deal that means its clients will get roughly 40% of the  gross of this movie plus a percentage of all the merchandising as well. "Hook"  will have to sell $125 million worth of tickets to break even.  </P> <P> Why did Tri-Star give away the store on this one, set for Christmas release in  1991? Because Tri-Star's dynamic Mike Medavoy believes "everyone is going to  make money." Reporter Laura Landro quotes another exec who says: "They made a  strategic decision to show that they could be in business with a director and  stars of this caliber, no matter what the cost. . . . But it could give them  enormous credibility."  </P> <P> Then, there is M's article by Russell Miller, "Star Struck! Has Hollywood  Hustled the Japanese?" There is some necessary rehash here in the story, the  tale of how Jon Peters and Peter Guber won the top spot to run Columbia, and  the magazine comments, "The big electronics companies are banking on movies to  sell their hardware. What they didn't count on were the spending habits of guys  like Guber and Peters."  </P> <P> Russell says Guber and Peters have gone underground. Knowing their Sony bosses  don't like all the publicity, "two of the fastest talkers in Hollywood are  suddenly overcome by shyness and a desire to avoid the limelight.  </P> <P> All requests for interviews are refused, it being 'too premature' for them to  speak about their plans. Family and friends are warned not to speak."  </P></p>

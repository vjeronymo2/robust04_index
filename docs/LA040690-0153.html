			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> WHEN HISTORY IS MADE OF CLAY  </P> <P> The J. Paul Getty Trust is involved in some fascinating work to preserve and  stabilize historic Spanish missions in Southern California. One such project at  Mission San Juan Capistrano, now in the infancy stage, could have far-reaching  implications for protecting historic adobe structures throughout the state from  earthquake damage.  </P> <P> Missions are threatened by more than earthquakes. At Mission San Juan  Capistrano, returning swallows will find the Great Stone Church wrapped in  scaffolding during the next few years while a preservation project stabilizes  and refaces crumbling sandstone. The Getty Conservation Institute, under the  umbrella of the trust, is offering some support. Also, the trust has just  announced a timely grant of $50,000 to San Gabriel Mission in Los Angeles  County for emergency repairs and for a detailed restoration analysis.  </P> <P> But the pioneering work will be in the institute's efforts to assemble at San  Juan Capistrano a collaborative project on adobe seismic stabilization.  </P> <P> The institute has already begun research at a field project in New Mexico to  preserve adobe from the ravages of weathering. The mission project will take it  further, to consider earthquake protection. The institute hopes to bring  together experts and project engineers already at the mission. The ambitious  goal is for new and accepted methods of damage control.  </P> <P> Sadly, historic adobes have easily fallen victim to earthquakes. And their  dwindling number makes this project a race against time. The trust and mission  consultants are to be commended for this initiative in preserving the state's  historic architecture.  </P></p>

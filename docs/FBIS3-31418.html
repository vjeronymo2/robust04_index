			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with certain articles carried by  today's dailies, which he described as putsch interpretations,  Filip Dimitrov, chairman of the Union of Democratic Forces [SDS]  National Coordinating Council, issued a declaration that was  disseminated by the SDS Press Center.    The adoption of a law according to which high-ranking  judiciary posts -- from chairmen of Okrug Court and okrug  prosecutors upward -- become a unique monopoly of the former  Communist Party is not a mere act of recommunization or a normal  loss of the opposition in a normal parliament, but an overt  communist counterrevolution.    It is true that there is still a long time until the law  comes into force, thus the opinion of the leadership of the SDS  parliamentary faction that there is a sufficient reason for the  faction to remain in the parliament is acceptable.    On the other hand, when we declare that we will not accept  this law it must be clear that we are serious.    The SDS chairman's walkout of the parliament, with the total  support of the parliamentary faction, could be a clear signal of  our categorical readiness to react in a sufficiently sharp  manner if the law comes into effect. Until then the  parliamentary faction must continue its struggle, notes Filip  Dimitrov.    Such an experience does not divide our faction but rather  consolidates it. It does not split the SDS but rather shows  that in our movement everyone accepts his responsibilities in an  organized and consistent manner in accordance with the functions  with which he has been entrusted.    I hope that in any event, after the Communists' dangerous  move in the parliament, the SDS will exhibit a sufficiently  mature and convincing reaction, states Filip Dimitrov, chairman  of the SDS National Coordinating Council.</p>

In an interview published in today's KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA  he notes that at the Ashgabat summit the positions of CIS  countries moved closer together on all matters, notably on  economic ones. Kazakhstan believes that the economies of CIS  countries can be stabilized through strengthening the  integration processes within the framework of the economic  union, which has now been set up.    Nursultan Nazarbayev believes that the introduction of  individual currencies is a powerful enough impetus for the  integration of Commonwealth states. He believes that at some  stage a currency will emerge that will be valid in all CIS  states.    All problems ought to be solved in close cooperation with  fellow Commonwealth members, and for Kazakhstan that means first  and foremost with Russia, Nursultan Nazarbayev noted.</p>

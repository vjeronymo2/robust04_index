			<p><P> July 14, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PUFFERY: ALL-AMERICAN CONCEIT TELLING A TALE OF EMPTINESS;  </P> <P> CELEBRITIES: THEY'RE DEMOCRATICALLY MADE, AND MASS-PRODUCED, FOR A PANTHEON  DEVOID OF REAL HEROES.  </P> <P> At midday, when Washingtonians are unlashed from their galley oars and allowed  to wander off in search of lunch, many of the currently mighty go to the Palm  restaurant. The experience should be chastening as well as nourishing.  </P> <P> The Palm's walls are covered with caricatures of famous faces from a few years  ago. Almost all are unknown to almost everyone today. Sic transit what? Glory?  Hardly. Fame? Not really. Celebrity is the perishable commodity.  </P> <P> That is the subject of a slender, melancholy novel on the sociology of  celebrity. The author is Michael Herr. The title is "Walter Winchell."  </P> <P> Winchell was a terrible person and a grotesque social phenomenon. In the 1940s,  he was at the apogee of a career that went from ripeness to putrescence with a  speed satisfying because appropriate. He dealt in ephemera, and such he proved  to be. But for awhile he prospered by feeding -- and by feeding, enlarging --  the nation's appetite for gossip, which is the democratic voyeurism of the  masses.  </P> <P> He was America's most widely read journalist, serving up six columns a week to  more than 1,000 newspapers, and his weekly radio broadcast was heard by more  people than the 50 million who read him, one-third of America's population  then. Herr captures (so well you want to take a shower) the rawness of the man  who hung out in the Stork Club in Manhattan with Hemingway and Damon Runyon and  low-lifes who were products as well as producers of our burgeoning publicity  industry.  </P> <P> Herr calls Winchell "the architect and the inventor of the end of private life"  and the "endless river of facts and distractions and gossip" with which we are  inundated. This blitzkrieg of clutter, often called news, leads to survival of  the briefest, because America's attention span is approximately 9.8 seconds.  That was the length of the average TV "sound bite" of candidates in the 1988  presidential campaign.  </P> <P> "If people go around today treating themselves like celebrities because not to  be a celebrity is just too awful, we may have Walter Winchell to thank," says  Herr.  </P> <P> No thanks. Do not confuse symptoms with cause. Thank -- blame -- democracy, and  the Graphic Revolution, and human nature.  </P> <P> Democracy -- equality before the law -- may be an irritant provoking an itch  for distinction, even the derivative distinction of knowing the inside skinny  about the ersatz-distinguished. Magically, celebrity can be mass-produced, yet  seem scarce. And it is democratic -- available to anyone -- because it is  unconnected with merit: Al Capone, one of America's first superstars, was  applauded at the ballpark.  </P> <P> In 1961, 11 years before Winchell died in obscurity, Daniel Boorstin published  "The Image: A Guide to Pseudo-Events in America." A pseudo-event is something  manufactured to seem significant. Celebrities are human pseudo-events.  </P> <P> What Boorstin calls the Graphic Revolution, from photography to television,  created novel powers for making people famous. Today our overpopulated  consciousness is chock-full of celebrities, people well-known for being  well-known. Celebrity, says Boorstin, is a new kind of eminence, a reflection  of the audience's emptiness, a receptacle into which people pour their  purposelessness.  </P> <P> The democratic ethos, celebrating the power of the people to govern themselves,  encourages derogation of heroes. Modern "democratic" historiography expels  heroes (and hence drama) from the human drama, replacing them with "forces" and  "classes" and "the people." But the empty pantheon is reoccupied by  celebrities, products of modern techniques for fabricating well-knownness.  </P> <P> Time was when people felt themselves made better by heroes who made themselves.  But celebrities are made democratically, by the people, and thus have no power  other than to amuse.  </P> <P> Boorstin notes that people with real fame enter a nation's consciousness  slowly, and inhabit its past. Celebrities exist only in the moment. And for a  moment.  </P> <P> The agency that makes celebrities -- publicity -- unmakes them, depriving them  of all they had: novelty. Round-the-clock media begets saturation journalism  (broadly defined), which wears out subjects quicker than you can say "Trump!"  </P> <P> "News," said one of Hearst's first editors, "is anything that makes a reader  say, 'Gee whiz!"' It is impossible to exaggerate the unimportance of most  things that make people say that.  </P></p>

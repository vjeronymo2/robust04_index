			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AUDIT QUESTIONS LAGUNA BUS LINE'S VALUE;  </P> <P> CITY OFFICIALS VOW TO FIGHT ANY ATTEMPT TO ELIMINATE SERVICE  </P> <P> An independent audit has questioned the worth of Laguna Beach's bus service,  but city officials on Wednesday vowed to battle any attempt to eliminate the  system.  </P> <P> City Councilman Dan Kenney said: "I can unequivocally say the city would fight  any move to do away with our transit system. We're not going to roll over and  play dead on this."  </P> <P> The audit of Laguna Beach's bus service was made for the Orange County  Transportation Commission, which controls state and federal funds going to  local transportation systems. About two-thirds of the budget for the Laguna  Beach Municipal Transit Lines comes through the commission.  </P> <P> "Laguna Beach is providing a very costly service for the benefit of a few  riders," the audit says. "The OCTC and the Laguna Beach City Council should  consider whether it is appropriate to continue the service."  </P> <P> Operating costs have increased about 10% during the past 3 years, according to  the audit, while the number of passengers has decreased about 5% and fare  revenue has declined by about 4%.  </P> <P> The percentage of costs paid by fares decreased from 19.8% to 17.17%, the  report says.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach City Manager Kenneth C. Frank on Wednesday said the coastal  community is not about to give up its transit system, the only city-owned bus  service in Orange County.  </P> <P> "We've been in business before the (Transportation) Commission was created, and  we'll be in business long after the . . . commission has gone," Frank said.  </P> <P> Deborah Christner, an analyst with the commission, said that Laguna Beach has  60 days to file its response to the audit.  </P> <P> The commissioners will formally receive the audit at a meeting on Monday, but  Christner said they won't vote on any of its recommendations for at least 2  months.  </P> <P> However, the commission is scheduled to act on proposed 5-year spending plans  for local transit operations, including Laguna's. Christner said the  commissioners may discuss some of the audit's findings as they go over Laguna's  proposed spending plans.  </P> <P> The audit, carried out by the Arthur Young &amp; Co. office in Costa Mesa,  questioned the low amount of money the Laguna Beach system gets from passenger  fares. The "Mainline service," which accounts for about 70% of the routes, only  brings in abut 27% of the system's revenue, the audit says.  </P> <P> In criticizing the revenue, the audit noted: "While operating costs have  continued to increase, adult fares have not been raised in several years and  seniors and handicapped passengers ride free."  </P> <P> Kenney, a former mayor of Laguna Beach, said Wednesday that the audit fails to  focus on the value of Laguna Beach's buses to its residents.  </P> <P> "The most important thing about the audit is what it does not say: the impact  on local residents if we did not have our transit system," Kenney said.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach's 19-year-old municipal transit system is particularly geared to  the city's unusual topography, including hills and coastal inlets, he said.  </P> <P> Traffic, already a severe problem in the community, would worsen without the  buses, Kenney said.  </P></p>

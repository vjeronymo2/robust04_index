			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 11 Apr (MENA)--Dr. Nabil Sha'th, President  'Arafat's political adviser and head of the Palestinian side at  the Palestinian-Israeli talks currently held in Cairo, said  discussion of the release of the Palestinian detainees held in  Israeli jails will be completed today. He added that the two  sides are close to reaching agreement on a timetable for their  release.    According to the International Red Cross, the number of the  Palestinian detainees is 10,400.    Sha'th dismissed reports that the PLO excluded Hamas members  from its request for the release of the detainees. He said a  timetable will be devised for freeing all the detainees one way  or another because the Palestinian negotiators represent the  entire Palestinian people.    Sha'th spoke about the obstacles impeding progress of the  negotiations with Israel, those being fixing a date for  withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho and signing an agreement in  this respect.    He emphasized that the timetable of withdrawal is a very  complex issue, particularly the starting date, which will  coincide with the signing of the accord. He said: We have not  yet reached agreement on such a date although we are approaching  13 April. He added that it is difficult to predict a date for  signing an agreement this week.    In his remarks, Dr. Sha'th said that the Israeli side  yesterday submitted a proposal concerning the timetable for the  Israeli forces' withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. Dr. Sha'th  noted that the present proposal is better than the unacceptable  earlier proposal they made. However, we must discuss this issue  more seriously today, he added.    Dr. Sha'th urged the United States, in its capacity as a  cosponsor of the peace conference, to do all it can to ensure  that the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration of Principles is  implemented.    The Palestinian official affirmed that no specific problems  currently face the Palestinian-Israeli Legal Affairs Committee.  But there are still certain issues to be discussed. Dr. Sha'th  maintained that the principal problem of the negotiations is the  time factor, because any delay in the signing of the agreement  would create further clashes and incidents that could be harmful  to the peace process. We want to spare our nations bloodshed as  a result of any delay in signing the agreement pertaining to the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Dr. Sha'th  added.    Meanwhile, Brigadier General 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head  of  the Palestinian side at the Security Committee, has stated that  the current negotiations are dealing with a number of basic  topics that are necessary to reach an agreement during this  round of negotiations. He stressed that no agreement has so far  been reached in drawing up a timetable for the release of the  Palestinian detainees.    In his statement, al-Yahya said: I cannot specify a date for  the entry of the police corps vanguards into Gaza and Jericho.  He pointed out, however, that serious efforts are currently  being made to ovebcome the differences affecting the two sides'  views. The Palestinian official expects that Israel will soon  lift the security blockade imposed on the occupied territories.    Knowledgeable Palestinian sources have told MENA that the  ongoing Palestinian-Israeli negotiations in Cairo are facing  basic and serious obstacles and that the negotiations are moving  in a vicious circle in view of the Israeli side's adherence to  its previous stances.    The same sources pointed out that the meetings of the  committees stemming from the Gaza-Jericho Committee have not  made any tangible progress. They said that under the  circumstances, the meetings would be a waste of time unless the  Israelis change their intransigent attitude.    The Palestinian sources added that the Israeli side has so  far refused to specify a timetable for the withdrawal from Gaza  and Jericho. The Israeli side also has not submitted an  acceptable proposal for the entry of the Palestinian police  force into Gaza and Jericho. This is in addition to the  continuing differences over the of type of arms to be carried by  the Palestinian police force, the sources said.    The sources maintained that Israel is trying to waste time  and is betting on this factor to create divisions within the  Palestinian ranks. Israel is also seeking to achieve gains in  the negotiations, but this attempt is doomed to failure, the  Palestinian sources said.    The Palestinian sources affirmed that there is now a dire  need to hold a high-level meeting between the Palestinian and  Israeli sides to resolve the outstanding issues. If this is not  possible, then those concerned with the peace process,  particularly the United States and Egypt, should intercede to  resolve the problems, the sources concluded.</p>

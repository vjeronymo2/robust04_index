			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal market analysts expect slow and arduous recovery in 1994 - The worst may be over for the world's metal producers, but a quick recovery in price levels is not on the cards The worst is over for metals producers in this economic cycle. But analysts suggest this does not mean that there will be a quick return to prosperity. The move away from the depths into which prices sank last year, a plunge that caused many producers big losses, will be slow and arduous. Analysts surveyed by the Financial Times predict that all but one of the London Metal Exchange-traded metals are likely to have a higher average price this year than in 1993 - the odd one out being copper, which some forecasters believe still has some way to fall. Most of the analysts suggest that lead is the base metal likely to show the biggest average price improvement this year. Precious metals, which recovered last year from the bottom of the trough they reached at the begining of 1993, are forecast to continue their steady price rise. According to Mr Philip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining group, base metals prices are likely to remain subdued right into 1995. While the US economy is picking up relatively strongly, Germany and Japan are still in the doldrums, he points out. This will delay any increase in demand for metals. 'The traffic lights may no longer be set at red, but amber is still flashing strongly in many important metal consuming regions,' he says. Like many other analysts, Mr Crowson suggests that, as producers cannot expect a strong boost in demand to come to their rescue, they must take their fate into their own hands. 'Until there are significant and genuine productions cuts, particularly in those metals where stocks are highest - aluminium and zinc - I see no reason for prices to move up very much.' Last January analysts were predicting that 1993 would be another tough year for metals producers and their worst fears were realised. Apart from deepening recession in most parts of the industrialised world, only partly compensated for by a sluggish improvement in the US, producers had to cope with worsening problems associated with the collapse of the former Soviet Union. This has meant either a surge in metal exports from the area (particularly of aluminium, nickel and zinc) or a steep fall in the imports the CIS used to make. As the accompanying chart shows, all the LME metals suffered a big drop in average prices in 1993 compared with 1992. In contrast gold's price, which was at a seven-year low on the first trading day of 1993 in London, moved up - as did platinum and silver prices. Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, now partly owned by the Jardine Matheson trading group, points out that in many previous economic cycles base metals have recovered nine to ten months after precious metals prices moved away from their lows. 'This seems to be happening again.' As usual, some predictions stand out because they are against the trend set by most of the analysts. For example, Mr Dan Roling at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, and Mr Wiktor Bielski at Bain &amp; Co, a Deutsche Bank company, are predicting a strong rise in copper's price while most of their competitors suggest a lacklustre performance can be expected from this metal. Mr Bielski explains his position: 'The fundamentals in the copper market are getting better all the time'. He cites US copper demand, up more than 8 per cent in 1993, and recent falls in copper stocks on both the New York Commodity Exchange and the LME. Stocks represent only about eight weeks' consumption, the lowest ever coming out of a recession, he points out. There was probably a 1.5 per cent increase in western world copper demand last year compared with 1992 and 'people are begining to realise there will not be a surge in supply in 1994'. He says only 60,000 to 70,000 tonnes of extra annual copper capacity is scheduled for 1994 - the big surge is due in 1995. From his New York base Mr Roling is out of step with the other (mainly London-based) analysts in his forecast of a steep drop in zinc prices. He explains: 'I believe there will be no production cuts'. Ord Minnett's Mr Moore stands out as a bull of aluminium. He remains convinced the aluminium industry will find a way before long to solve the international crisis caused by supplies of the metal - much of it from Russia - swamping demand. He says most of the improvement in aluminium's price, and the prices of other base metals, will come in the second half when he predicts that London Metal Exchange stocks, at present at record levels, 'will fall precipitously'. Precious metals analysts whose forecasts are not in the chart include Mr Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland, who suggests that the price of gold might move over Dollars 400 an ounce in the short term. Looking a year ahead, however, he sees the metal back at Dollars 350 an ounce. Mr George Milling-Stanley at Lehman Brothers, the New York financial services group, is forecasting an average gold price of about Dollars 375 an ounce in 1994. He also suggests there will be a higher range for gold this year - of Dollars 420 to Dollars 350, compared with 1993's range of Dollars 410 to Dollars 325. He says: 'Speculative buying may carry the price beyond the 1993 high, but gold has stalled between Dollars 400 and Dollars 430 on several occasions in recent years, and this area can be expected to provide considerable resistance'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Andrey Nikolayev, commander in chief of the Russian  Border Troops, and Yawgen Bacharow, commander of the Belarus  Border Troops, initialled the draft of an intergovernmental  agreement on border questions at their meeting in Zaslavl. Here  is Yuriy Sverko, our Minsk correspondent with the details.    Bacharow did not rule out the possibility that this  agreement  could be signed by the prime ministers of the two countries  during Viktor Chernomyrdin's forthcoming visit to Minsk.  Nikolayev stated at a news conference in Zaslavl that this was  the first such agreement between Russia and another CIS country.    Replying to a question from the correspondent about the  future of the Russian-Belarus border, Nikolayev said: If not  just [Belarus] national interests but also Russian interests are  protected on the borders between Belarus and non-Commonwealth  states and the interests of Belarus are protected on Russian  borders, if the heads of government sign the document that has  been initialled, then totally new relations will begin and there  will be no reason for having any special regime on the border  between Russia and Belarus.    In the opinion of the head of Russia's Federal Border  Service, the border with Belarus should be open. This will  require the drawing together of the two countries' laws and  other normative documents, the coordination of customs services  activities and health control. If the internal borders of the  CIS are to be closed, Nikolayev noted, then the economic  alliance between the countries of the Commonwealth will never  begin to operate properly.    At the meeting near Minsk there was also discussion on the  question of creating identical border regimes on Russia's and  Belarus' borders with Latvia and Lithuania. Nikolayev said that  the Russian Federation was ready to carry out an expert  examination of the work carried out in Belarus and to pay its  share. This, Bacharow stated, would comprise up to 50 percent  of Belarus' expenditure in building and equipping installations  on the borders with the Baltic countries.</p>

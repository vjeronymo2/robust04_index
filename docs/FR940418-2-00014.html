			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since information provided at verification indicates that these funds were used to train workers remaining at ILVA, we determine that the GOI's training contribution under Law 181/89 constitutes a benefit to ILVA.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the Department's practice to treat training benefits as recurring grants (see GIA at 37226). Accordingly, we divided the amount received by the sales of the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy from this program to be 0.10 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> G. ECSC Article 54 Loans  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under Article 54 of the 1951 ECSC Treaty, the European Commission can provide loans directly to iron and steel companies for modernization and the purchase of new equipment. The loans finance up to 50 percent of an investment project. The remaining financing needs must be met from other sources. The Article 54 loan program is financed by loans taken by the Commission, which are then re-lent to iron and steel companies in the member states at a slightly higher interest rate than that at which the Commission obtained them.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ILVA had outstanding Article 54 loans in the POI. These loans were transferred to ILVA as part of the partial transfer of Terni's assets and liabilities in 1989. Two of these loans were denominated in U.S. dollars and two in European Currency Units (``ECU'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because Article 54 loans are limited to iron and steel companies, we find these loans to be specific and, therefore, countervailable to the extent that they were provided on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because these loans were denominated in foreign currencies, we used foreign currency benchmarks for our preliminary determination. However, the Article 54 loans had exchange rate guarantees that allowed Terni to calculate the maximum lire amount payable ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Law 796/76 Exchange Rate Guarantee Program described below). Since these loans were effectively insulated from any future changes in the exchange rate, we are not using foreign currency benchmark interest rates as we did in the preliminary determination. Rather we are using the uncreditworthy benchmark discussed in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Benchmark and Discount Rate <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  section above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At verification we found that one of the U.S. dollar loans had been assumed by Terni when it became the parent company of the original debtor. We are using the uncreditworthy benchmark interest rate for the year in which the loan was assumed by Terni in order to calculate the benefit from this loan, as that was the year in which Terni incurred the liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the interest rates paid on all the Article 54 loans were below the benchmark interest rates, we determine that the loans provided under this program are countervailable. We calculated the benefit using our standard long-term loan methodology. We then divided the benefit allocated to the POI by the sales made by the Specialty Steels Division of ILVA. On this basis, we determine the estimated net subsidy to be 1.02 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  for all manufacturers, producers, and exporters in Italy of the subject merchandise.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Programs Determined To Be Not Countervailable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Early Retirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In Certain Steel from Italy, we determined that the threat of strikes and social unrest prevented Italian steel companies from laying off surplus labor. As a result, these companies were effectively obligated to retain their workers until the workers reached retirement age. Given this obligation, when the GOI created a program to allow for early retirement, we determined that the steel companies had been relieved of the burden of retaining these employees at full salary until the normal retirement age.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preliminary determination of this investigation, we relied on Certain Steel from Italy and determined that early retirement provided a countervailable benefit which we measured as the savings to ILVA arising from not having to pay wages to the workers who took early retirement in the POI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> At verification in this case, the GOI provided evidence showing that companies in Italy have the legal right to fire workers. Small companies (those with less than 15 employees) could simply eliminate surplus workers. Large companies, however, go through certain steps and procedures before they can lay workers off (other than for cause). The procedures and the benefits paid to employees laid off by these companies are provided for in Law 223/91.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

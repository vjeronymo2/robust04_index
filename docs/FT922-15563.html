			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Survey of Factoring (5): Factors enter where banks fear to tread - Big US store chains hold key to recovery AFTER three years of watching one highly-leveraged retailer after another file for bankruptcy protection, US factors are cautiously optimistic that 1992 may herald a return to stability. The year started on an encouraging note, with Federated and Allied department stores emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors - the first big US retailers to do so successfully. And spirits were only somewhat dampened by a bankruptcy filing by R. H. Macy after the Christmas selling season. The big New York-based department store chain, which was taken private in a management-led Dollars 3.6bn leveraged buyout in 1985, had been on a shaky financial footing for several years and the filing did not take anyone by surprise. The fate of retailers is crucial to US factors, since factoring in the US remains the domain of the clothing, textile and home furnishing industries. About 80 per cent of yearly turnover comes from apparel-related businesses. Among the services provided by factors in the US are credit-checking, guaranteeing that credit and providing advances against accounts receivable. Clients can choose to use any or all of these services. The reliance on retail-related business left US factors particularly vulnerable to a string of big department store bankruptcies, which started with Campeau's Federated and Allied Department Stores in 1989 and may have ended this year with RH Macy's chapter 11 filing. But for the factors who weathered the US retail shake-up, there have been some unexpected benefits to the upheaval which may stand them in good stead as the economy starts to revive. Mr Sidney Rutberg, an editor at Daily News Record and an expert on factoring, believes that publicity over the big department store bankruptcies actually helped some factors. Since factors provide a credit protection service, some manufacturers started to turn to factors to protect themselves while continuing to supply large but unstable customers. 'All the publicity about big credit losses has helped factors increase their client-base,' says Mr Rutberg. The recession's impact on US banking has also had a positive impact on factors. As banks have become more wary about lending, a growing number of mid-size businesses have turned to factoring for funds. Indeed, 1991 was an improvement on 1990 in terms of factoring volume. Overall industry volume rose 4.5 per cent to Dollars 51.2bn, compared with growth of just 2.1 per cent a year earlier to Dollars 49.01bn. During the year, Fuji Bank's Chicago-based Heller Financial overtook CIT Group/Factoring to become the biggest US factor in terms of volume. Heller's factoring volume climbed 8.3 per cent to Dollars 7.04bn from Dollars 6.5bn, while CIT's improved 2.6 per cent to Dollars 6.93bn from Dollars 6.75bn. Of the other big factors, BNY Financial, which acquired BT factors in 1990, had static volume of Dollars 6.2bn in 1991, while Citizen's &amp; Southern Commercial, which acquired Security Pacific Factors in 1989, saw volume grow 2.8 per cent to Dollars 5.96bn. Citizen's &amp; Southern has changed its name to NationsBanc Commercial. Increased exposure to bad debt has been one of the most worrying aspects of the recession for factors. However, while the increase in 1991 volume was somewhat offset by credit losses, Mr Rutberg says that these losses were not disastrous and all the big US factors made money last year. Even Republic Factors, which saw a 9.5 per cent decline in 1991 volume to Dollars 3.8bn, is believed to have been profitable in the year. Indeed, there have been no major factoring failures in spite of the high number of retailing bankruptcies. Factors started to take steps to protect themselves after the Federated and Allied bankruptcy set off alarms about the outlook for other highly-leveraged retailers, for whom the combination of a soft retail environment and high interest payments might prove lethal. Factors and retailers started to work much more closely together in the following years. In the case of Macy, for example, a special credit committee was set up to work with factors and review the company's financial position. Close relations with retailers are important, since factors cannot survive if they refuse entirely to ship to big retailers. 'Most of the big retail bankruptcies have been telegraphed so factors were able to ease their way down although they were not able to get out altogether,' said Mr Rutberg. 'Factors protected themselves by charging premiums of about 1 to 2 per cent on top of normal factoring commissions for shipments to highly leveraged retailers such as Macy's and they also shared the risk.' The trend of consolidation in the industry seems to have started to slow. The number of big factors held steady at about 17 in the last year after dropping from 30 a few years ago. The coming year may see some more consolidation, though at a slower pace. There are rumours that BankBoston's factoring business is for sale, for example. BancBoston Financial had turnover of Dollars 3.9bn last year. Meanwhile, every small sign of economic recovery and returning consumer confidence in the US is encouraging news for factors.</p>

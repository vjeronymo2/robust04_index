			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / S Africa runs out of budget options MR Barend du Plessis, South Africa's finance minister, today delivers his government's budget against a background of a weakening economy and escalating demands on stretched revenues. Mr du Plessis has little room for manoeuvre, with significant sweeteners for the taxpayer unlikely. Instead, the budget is likely to consolidate the trend towards equalising social spending between the different racial groups, with individual taxpayers again being hard hit by the effects of fiscal drag, as pay rises to compensate for inflation suck them into higher tax bands. The key factor limiting the finance minister's options is the state of the economy, which has been in recession for three years. Economists are forecasting growth of little more than 1 per cent this year and the outlook for revenue growth is poor. Total revenue for the 1991/2 tax year is likely to be about R2.5bn below the original estimate of R76.65bn (Pounds 15.5bn). Raising taxes is also not much of an option. South Africans are already fairly heavily taxed, with government spending nearly 29 per cent of gross domestic product. It is also unlikely the minister will raise Value Added Tax, currently at 10 per cent, given the political uproar that accompanied its introduction last September. The consensus among economists is that the work of attracting more revenue will be left to fiscal drag, which has the effect of reducing real incomes. Scope for borrowing is limited. In the 1991/2 year, the deficit before borrowing is estimated to have reached about R13bn, or 4.5 per cent of GDP, compared with the R10.1bn, or 3.4 per cent, deficit forecast by the government. Some economists argue that the larger deficit had more to do with revenue shortfalls than spending overruns, although they agree such a large deficit is unsustainable. The size of the public debt has risen sharply in recent years, from 33.9 per cent of GDP in 1990 to over 37 per cent in the second and third quarters of 1991. Given the lack of flexibility on the revenue side, a large part of any shift towards equalising social spending - on pensions, for example - will have to come from spending cuts elsewhere. President FW de Klerk said as much when he opened parliament in February. He spoke of the need for 'relatively drastic structural changes ..especially in respect of current expenditure.' The government has already announced reforms to the white school system which could save about R400m and their appears to be greater resolve than in the past to curb civil servant salaries which consume about 35 per cent of the budget. Today's budget is likely to be the last by a Nationalist government - if the reform process stays on track, next year's budget will be the product of multi-party deliberations in an interim government.</p>

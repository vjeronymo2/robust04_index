			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PEOPLE'S PHARMACY: TANNING PILL WITH CANTHAXANTHIN MAY DAMAGE VISION  </P> <P> Question: With all the warnings about the dangers of getting too much sun, I  was intrigued by an ad I recently saw for a tanning pill. It contains something  called canthaxanthin which is supposed to be natural, harmless and approved by  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  </P> <P> These tanning pills sound too good to be true but they aren't cheap. What do  you think?  </P> <P> Answer: Canthaxanthin is a food coloring that is chemically related to beta  carotene, the orange color in carrots. The amount of this agent used in food,  however, is minuscule compared to the levels found in tanning pills.  </P> <P> Such products do not produce a golden glow that resembles a natural tan. The  skin tends to turn more an orange color, and the stool can turn red. More  alarming are reports of golden yellow crystals that show up in the retina of  the eye. Prolonged use of these products may even lead to visual damage. The  FDA has NOT approved canthaxanthin for use in tanning pills, so these products  are illegal. If the FDA discovers them being sold, they are seized and removed  from the market.  </P> <P> You are right to avoid a "natural" tan, but tanning pills don't appear to be  risk-free either. Another alternative is dihydroxyacetone, a tanning lotion  found in products such as Clinique Self-Tanning Formula, Coppertone Sunless  Tanning Lotion and Estee Lauder Self-Action Tanning Creme.  </P> <P> Q: I just picked up a new prescription and the pharmacist told me not to store  the pills in the bathroom. I like to keep my medications in the medicine chest  so I remember to take them first thing in the morning. If the lid is on tight,  what difference does it make where they are stored?  </P> <P> A: Check your bathroom mirror. If it fogs up when you take a shower or bath,  there is too much humidity in the air to be good for drugs. Child-proof caps  can't seal that moisture out. And even regular lids let humidity in every time  the bottle is opened.  </P></p>

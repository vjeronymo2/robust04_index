			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> MAN SAVES NIECE AND NEPHEW FROM FIRE  </P> <P> A 23-year-old man rescued his infant niece from a fire that erupted Wednesday  in the girl's bedroom and then injured himself trying to put out the blaze,  fire officials said.  </P> <P> "If it weren't for him, she would have died," said Santa Ana Fire Department  Capt. Robert Soria.  </P> <P> "He acted quickly and did a really good job."  </P> <P> Elliot Dunning was getting ready to go to work at about 9:15 a.m Wednesday when  he heard a crackling noise in his niece's bedroom, Soria said. The house is in  the 1700 block of Raymar Street.  </P> <P> When Dunning opened the bedroom door, he saw that a portable floor heater had  melted through an electrical cord and had ignited a mattress next to the girl's  crib.  </P> <P> The uncle grabbed the infant and alerted his 5-year-old nephew to get out of  the house, Soria said.  </P> <P> "He went back into house to try to smother the fire with a blanket but only  helped to spread flames before smoke overcame him," Soria said.  </P> <P> After Dunning ran back outside, he tore open the security bars that covered the  bedroom window and punched a hole in the glass with his fist. He tried to  control the fire with a garden hose until the fire units arrived, Soria said.  </P> <P> Firefighters extinguished the flames within 10 minutes.  </P> <P> Dunning's 5-year-old nephew wept as he watched fire crews work to put out the  blaze. "All my toys are in there," he cried.  </P> <P> Dunning received minor cuts on his hand and suffered from smoke inhalation,  Soria said.  </P> <P> The blaze was contained to the bedroom, which was destroyed. Fire officials  estimated the damage at $20,000 to the structure and $5,000 in damage to the  furniture. MATT LAIT and MARK BOSTER  </P></p>

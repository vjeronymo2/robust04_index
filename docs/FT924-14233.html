			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Books: Love blossoms amid the tombs in Gdansk - Fiction THE CALL OF THE TOAD by Gunter Grass Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 248 pages THE PROFESSOR hero of Gunter Grass's new novel is nicknamed Jeremiah, a reproach often levelled at his creator. The Call of the Toad - a funny, wise, hugely enjoyable fantasy - confirms Grass as Germany's most eloquent literary prophet. Since the Tin Drum in 1959, Grass has transformed figures from European folk tales into potent symbols for his distrust of 20th-century Germany, and has written a string of anarchic, warning novels. The fable titles - The Rat, Cat and Mouse - are giveaways; there was also a malevolent black hound in Dog Years; a feminist fish in The Flounder; an elusive snail, metaphor for political change, in the 1970s; and, most famously, the dwarf Oskar who refuses to grow up in amoral Nazi Germany in The Tin Drum. With The Call of the Toad, Grass brings the fable landscape of the Europe of his lifetime up to date. At once a satire on post-1989 politics and a love story, it shows two sides of the author: firebrand and mellowed, humane observer. In the Tin Drum, sex was as sordid as the regime that encompassed it; 30 years on, the heart of this new piece is the romantic meeting between Alexandra and Alexander, both widowed, at the Gdansk market just before the fall of the Berlin wall. She is a Pole exiled from Lithuania; he, like Grass, is a German born in the city when it was Danzig and now exiled in west Germany. She is a gildress, he an expert tomb restorer. From a double optimism - their art and their late-blooming love - emerges an ironic fantasy. The couple found a Cemetery of Reconciliation for German natives of Gdansk to be buried in the city, and for Poles to be buried in Lithuania. But the idea takes off too quickly; speculators move in, the powerful Deutschemark devours plots all over Gdansk. There are vulgar re-burials and recrimination. Capitalism defeats idealism: a metaphor for present west-east relations and the too-hasty German reunification, against which Grass campaigned from the start. As in the Tin Drum, his masterstroke is to interpret horror through a so-called image which amuses without being flippant. Satirical echoes crash through the pages. At the lyrical core is a folklore parallel: the call of the toad, which the couple record on the Baltic estuaries, by superstition foreshadows disaster. In 1990, the toad calls too early in the spring; by 1999, the nightmare is of 'a spanking new bicycle rickshaw with a toad as passenger, rolling in the direction of the future.' Grass's novels are always embellished by the same grotesque chorus - fish, eels, toads, snails, boletus mushrooms squirm like details from German expressionist paintings, the edible or vegetable now animate, now transformed into a human face. Among contemporaries, only the novelist Garcia Marquez equals him as an image-maker. Stone by stone, rivulet by mudbank, Danzig and the Baltic coast build up into the poetic symbol and creative spring of all Grass's work; like Joyce's Dublin or Bashevis Singer's Poland, they are the dream home of the exiled writer, evoked half a century on with the microscopic precision of a guide book. But they are also an historical symbol. In the Tin Drum and Cat and Mouse, Danzig is the backcloth for Grass's dissection of nazism; it was also the prize at the end of the Polish Corridor for which Hitler began the second world war. In the 1980s, unrest in Gdansk's shipyards heralded the end of communism in eastern Europe. In The Call of the Toad, Gdansk citizens are guilt-ravaged but on the make, and the city loses its soul to the Deutschmark: Danzig holds the novel together like a magnet; taut yet exuberant, complex yet clear as a nursery rhyme, endlessly inventive, its themes pull always back to this central image. Translated by the masterly Ralph Manheim (who died so recently) into limpid, lively prose,The Call of the Toad shows Grass as one of our greatest living storytellers.</p>

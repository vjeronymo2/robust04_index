			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Survey of Sweden (8): Nuclear deadline looms - Christopher Brown-Humes examines energy policy Sweden is a country with one of the safest nuclear power industries in the world - and yet it has committed itself to phasing out nuclear power entirely by the year 2010. Perhaps only in a country of such dogged environmental idealism could so dramatic a move be contemplated when nuclear power accounts for close to 50 per cent of electricity production. Nuclear power has been a hot potato in Sweden for 20 years. The issue has nagged away with varying degrees of intensity in the political debate, even helping to decide the outcome of one general election. It has gained added urgency every time there is a nuclear spillage beyond Sweden's borders, such as the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster in the US and the Chernobyl disaster in the Ukraine in 1986. Now, as the 2010 deadline looms, a new urgency has developed and a new political crisis may be in the offing. If the final deadline is to be met, a date for the phase-out of the first of the 12 reactors has to be fixed soon. In many countries, the practicalities of the matter would decide the issue. Most of Sweden's nuclear power plants are nowhere near the end of their technical lives. Replacing them would be extremely costly, there are no easy alternatives, and there is an obvious risk of higher electricity prices. But in Sweden there is a strong political will to phase out the controversial energy source completely. The Centre, Christian Democrat, Left and Environment parties have all tied themselves to the anti-nuclear mast. More importantly, the Social Democratic prime minister, Mr Ingvar Carlsson, is personally committed to the phase-out, saying 2010 is 'a realistic commitment.' His party, however, is split on the question. The 2010 date was set by parliament in 1980 after a national referendum in which Swedes voted to dismantle their nuclear industry. The date chosen was 25 years after the last of Sweden's reactors was commissioned in 1985. Why 25 years? Because that was assumed to be a nuclear plant's technical lifespan just because it is the standard depreciation period for Swedish nuclear assets. The issue again came to the fore in the late 1980s when parliament decided to dismantle the first two plants in 1995 and 1996. However this commitment was side-stepped as part of a three-way accord between the Social Democrats, the Centre Party and the Liberals in early 1991. The 2010 target, however, remained in place. The importance of nuclear power to Sweden is not contested. Last year it generated 58.9 terawatts of power, or 41.8 per cent of the country's electricity needs. Hydro-electric power produced 73.3 TWh, or 52 per cent. Ironically, the improving efficiency of Swedish nuclear plants and the expected re-commissioning of a plant that has been out of service means the nuclear contribution is predicted to rise over the next two years. Next year, nuclear electricity output could reach 69.0 TWh, 48 per cent of the total. This is a huge hole for other power sources to fill. The difficulty has been exacerbated because 'renewable' energy sources such as wind, solar energy and biomass have not become as commercially viable as was expected at the time of the 1980 referendum. In fact, Sweden is being forced to try and reconcile a number of mutually incompatible objectives. It wants to be rid of nuclear power, but it is not prepared to dam more rivers in the north of the country to increase hydro-power generation. It cannot insist on renewables, but it knows that falling back on coal and gas would increase carbon dioxide emissions. Finally, it wants to maintain internationally competitive energy prices and protect jobs. In other words, there are no easy answers. Heavy investments in coal and gas-fired power plants look to be the only realistic alternatives, but that could cost the country a staggering SKr200bn, according to some estimates. The problems might eventually be eased by a broad deregulation of the Swedish, Nordic and even north European power markets. But the Social Democrats have just postponed deregulation of the Swedish market, which was due to take effect on January 1 1995, and the deregulation of the north European market still looks to be some way off. For the moment, the issue is again on hold. A commission has been established to map out a realistic Swedish energy policy, covering everything from nuclear power to deregulation. Its task will be to detail the costs and environmental implications of the different solutions before the end of next year. Power industry experts are convinced that the 2010 date will be dropped. 'I have never thought the politicians would go ahead with the phase-out,' says Dr Karl-Axel Edin, president of Tentum, a Stockholm energy consultancy. 'The safety of nuclear power has increased more than tenfold since the referendum and energy sources like wind-power and biomass are not going to fill the gap.' The assessment may well be correct - but that does not mean there will not be another political crisis over the issue or that one or two nuclear plants will not be sacrificed along the way. Mr Sigfrid Leijonhufvud, author of A History of Swedish Nuclear Power, believes there could be another referendum on the issue. Alternatively, he suggests the deadline could be postponed as a gesture to some future political partner, such as the Liberals, if the minority Social Democratic government was ever forced into a coalition. But Mr Leijonhufvud notes that Mr Carlsson is 'morally bound' over the 2010 deadline and believes it could even prove to be the issue on which the 60-year-old party veteran eventually decides to step down.</p>

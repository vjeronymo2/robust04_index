			<p><P> January 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FORD SAYS OKLAHOMA TO PROVIDE TEST FOR CLEMSON  </P> <P> During the 1980s, Clemson has won 5 Atlantic Coast Conference championships and  1 national title. During that span, Oklahoma has won 5 Big Eight championship  and 1 national title.  </P> <P> Both teams are 9-2 entering today's Citrus Bowl game. Clemson is ranked 13th,  Oklahoma 10th.  </P> <P> Still, Clemson Coach Danny Ford believes this game represents a measuring stick  of sorts for his team.  </P> <P> "We're anxious to play the University of Oklahoma because of their tradition,"  Ford said. "We want to play and see where we are. We know where Oklahoma is.  They're there every year."  </P> <P> Where Oklahoma is going is on probation. The received National Collegiate  Athletic Assn. sanctions 2 weeks ago, and this will be the Sooners last bowl  game for at least 2 years.  </P> <P> Oklahoma Coach Barry Switzer said the sanctions would have no effect on the  game.  </P> <P> "That won't be an excuse," he said. "Clemson will have more to do with it than  anything else."  </P> <P> Throughout the week, Ford and his players have described the Sooners in glowing  terms. Switzer, for one, doesn't believe the praise is deserved.  </P> <P> "We are a good college football team, but we're not anywhere near what we have  been before," Switzer said, alluding to the teams that went 11-1 in each of the  past 3 seasons.  </P> <P> Clemson, who lost to Florida State and North Carolina State, comes into the  Citrus Bowl with a 4-game winning streak. The Tigers scored at least 29 points  in each of those games.  </P> <P> Rodney Williams directed an I-formation offense that averaged 397 yards per  game, the best in Ford's 10 seasons as coach. The senior quarterback, who has  been named most valuable player in both of his bowl games, doesn't throw often  or well, but he does win. His 31-10-2 record makes him the winningest starter  in ACC history.  </P> <P> One reason Williams doesn't throw much is tailback Terry Allen, who became the  first Clemson sophomore to rush for more than 1,000 yards when he ran for 1,139  this season.  </P> <P> Clemson prefers to keep the ball on the ground, although Williams burned Penn  State for 214 passing yards in a 35-10 Fiesta Bowl victory last year.  </P> <P> Oklahoma finished fourth nationally with an average of 343 yards rushing per  game. However, that was accomplished mostly on artificial turf and with Charles  Thompson at quarterback.  </P> <P> When the Sooners take to the grass field of the Citrus Bowl, gimpy-legged  Jamelle Holieway will be the quarterback in his final collegiate game.  </P></p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory hopes fade over by-election THE TORIES seem to have all but thrown in the towel for the Christchurch by-election as their campaign moves falteringly into the final days. None of the party's crowd-pullers is scheduled to appear in a last-ditch effort to persuade traditional supporters in the south coast constituency to turn back to the Tories. Mr William Waldegrave, the public services minister, is due in Christchurch this morning but tomorrow the Tories' campaign will be left to Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, making his customary eve-of-poll appearance. The arrangements for rallies by the three main parties last night added to the impression that the Tories have no real hope for the seat. The Liberal Democrats, who are tipped to score a resounding victory, fielded Mr Paddy Ashdown, the party leader; Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, turned out for Labour, while Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, spoke at the Tories' public meeting. Sir Edward has recently fuelled the row over Europe within the Conservative party by outspoken attacks on the Euro-sceptics, and it appears to have been the local constituency association, rather than central office, that thought it would be helpful to make use of his offer to assist the campaign. Both the Tories and the Liberal Democrats were, however, playing down constituency opinion polls which suggested that the Tory majority of 23,000 would be convincingly overturned. Mrs Diana Maddock, the Liberal Democrat, thought it was 'doubtful' that the current state of opinion was as good for her party as the polls suggested. There were, she said, still 'an awful lot of Conservatives' who were undecided. Labour yesterday claimed that the Liberal Democrats were home and dry, and so Labour supporters did not have to vote tactically to ensure the Conservatives lost. Mr Robert Hayward, the Tory candidate, said one-off constituency polls were inaccurate. 'There are a large number of waverers and we are targeting them to achieve victory on Thursday,' he said.</p>

			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / Lloyd's faces big rise in pollution claims LLOYD'S of London faces a substantial increase in possible claims from US pollution, damaging further the prospects of the insurance market. Lloyd's syndicates have already put aside more than Pounds 1bn to pay claims from US pollution cases and are likely to need to increase their reserves again following an estimated 30 per cent surge in claims notifications during 1992. 'It is a young problem in terms of insurance but it is still growing,' said Mr Alan Pollard, chief executive of Syndicate Underwriting Management. SUM handles claims on behalf of more than 80 syndicates which are no longer in business and about 17 per cent of all pollution claims at Lloyd's. The run-off company, which is owned by the Lloyd's corporation, received notification of 13,000 claims last year compared with 10,000 in 1991. The corporation regulates and services the Lloyd's market. Mr Pollard predicts that many more syndicates will be forced to keep their accounts open for 1990 when they report results for that year this June. This is because of uncertainty about pollution, asbestosis and other so-called 'long-tail' liabilities, which sometimes arise on policies underwritten more than 30 years ago. These long-tail claims have added to Lloyd's losses in recent years, which are set to exceed Pounds 4bn for the three years 1988 to 1990. One leading underwriter said last week: 'Half the professionals on the market think that (claims from US) pollution is the end of the world as we know it.' In a separate development Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, has announced the loss of a further 300 jobs at the corporation. Mr Middleton aims to reduce staff numbers by a further 300 to 1,600 before the end of the year. Since taking over last September, he has cut 300 jobs as part of a Pounds 29.5m cut in the budget to Pounds 115m. 'There is a vital need for us to help to restore the competitive edge of the Lloyd's market,' he said. Other changes which were reported yesterday include a reduction in management layers from 15 to six, and introducing performance pay and a staff appraisal system. The government is seriously considering scrapping proposals for a register of contaminated land, one of the most bitterly contested part of the government's environment policy, after criticism that it could blight property values.</p>

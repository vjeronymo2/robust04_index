			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Election 1992: Polls highlight PM's dilemma THE CONSERVATIVES enter the final few days of the campaign behind Labour, and their chances of closing the gap do not look promising. Although many opinion polls have shown that the electorate as a whole thinks Mr John Major would be a more capable prime minister than his rivals, his party's campaign has failed to persuade floating voters that Tory policies are the best or that he is the most capable leader. These are the main conclusions of a survey of floating voters conducted by Mori for the BBC. The findings of the fifth wave of interviews among this panel, conducted on Thursday and Friday of last week, show that just 16 per cent of the electorate are still in the 'floating' category, made up of 2 per cent who say they will not vote, 2 per cent who are still undecided and 12 per cent who say they now support a party but who 'may change their mind' before polling day. Only about two in three of these will vote on the day, leaving one in 10 of the electorate for the parties to fight over in the final days of the campaign. Before the campaign began no fewer than 39 per cent of the electorate were 'floaters', including 15 per cent classed as 'don't know's', and 24 per cent 'soft supporters' - for example, those with stated party loyalties but possibly willing to switch. According to other Mori polls, the key issues in the minds of the voters are health, education and jobs. Among the floating voters in the Mori/BBC panel, Labour has a wide lead over the Conservatives on health (23 points) and unemployment (28 points), but on education the Liberal Democrats beat both the larger parties, with 33 per cent to Labour's 29 per cent and the Conservatives' 28 per cent. During the campaign the Conservatives have made no ground at all on Labour over health and education. On the handling of inflation, they have maintained a strong lead over Labour - 48 per cent to 19 per cent. However, on unemployment the Conservatives have gained three points but still lag 28 points behind Labour. The tax issue has failed to ignite in the way the Conservative party hoped; floating voters have not rated it high as an issue. This may partly be explained by the finding that only 3 per cent of the panel said they expected the Conservatives to cut the overall level of tax 'a lot' and a majority, 57 per cent, don't think the Tories would cut tax at all. The Tories' crucial weaknesses seem to be mood and record. Members of the panel were asked whether they agreed or disagreed that 'it's time for a change'. Three in four of the panel agreed, including more than a third of those inclined to vote Conservative. Superficially, the government's record appears not to be a problem. Only one in 10 floating voters feel that the Major government bears responsibility for the recession, whereas just more than half blame Mrs Margaret Thatcher's government, with a similar proportion blaming the world economy. This 'Teflon factor', however, does not really protect Mr John Major because floating voters who blame the Thatcher government have been more reluctant to switch to the Tories during the campaign than those who do not. Only one in four Conservative switchers blame Mrs Thatcher, compared with almost three quarters of Labour switchers. Since more than half those on the panel who are still wavering also believe the Thatcher government bears blame for the recession, they may be more likely to switch to Labour rather than the Conservatives. Meanwhile, Labour has made up ground on the economy. The Conservatives began the campaign with a significant 42 per cent to 19 per cent lead over Labour as the party which floating voters think can best handle the economy, a lead of 23 points. By the end of last week they were recording 41 per cent to the Labour party's 23 per cent, losing five points of their lead along the way. The Liberal Democrats boosted their level from 10 per cent to 18 per cent. There has also been a big switch in the floating voter view of the battle between the party leaders. At the start of the campaign Mr Major had a 15 per cent lead over Mr Paddy Ashdown as 'the most capable prime minister', with Mr Neil Kinnock trailing a poor third. By this weekend Mr Kinnock still trailed at 16 per cent, but Mr Ashdown had overtaken Mr Major, with 39 per cent to the prime minister's 35 per cent. When asked which party leader had been most impressive during the campaign, a majority of the floating voters (54 per cent) picked Mr Ashdown, a sharp rise from the 38 per cent who expressed this view after one week of campaigning. Mr Major's campaign rating has fallen to 14 per cent, behind Mr Kinnock. One explanation for Mr Ashdown's success in the campaign might be the fact that floating voters think he has fought positively on his party's issues. Three floaters in four think the Liberal Democrats have mainly put forward their own policies rather than attacking the other parties. Three in four (76 per cent) think the Conservatives have mainly attacked their opponents; six in 10 say the same of Labour. Floating voters are split on the idea of coalition government. Half say it would be better for Britain to be governed by a single party, while 46 per cent would prefer a coalition. John Curtice is senior lecturer in politics at Strathclyde University. The BBC survey was undertaken by Mori in five waves, starting the week before the election campaign began. Mori spoke by telephone to 1,146 panellists, weighted to reflect the profile of all floating voters on April 2-3 .</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by CTK and "(bor)": "The Collapse of East Europe </F> Has Caused More Problems for the West, Says Zieleniec"]    [Text] Prague--The collapse of the communist bloc perhaps  caused greater problems for Western Europe than for East Europe,  said Czech Foreign Minister J. Zieleniec on 14 May in Prague in  a speech delivered at an international conference called "Europe  and Us." Zieleniec pointed out that, while the danger in the  East had previously been the adhesive of West European  integration, the European Union [EU] must now look painstakingly  for a firm integrating vision. He described the influence of  the crisis of the so-called social state, which put down roots  in Western Europe, as a major problem for European integration.  The effect of this crisis has been that more and more  discussion is being devoted to quotas or subsidies than to the  political substance of Europe. "We think more about what  divides us than about what unites us," said the minister with  regard to the EU and its operation. In an exchange of views  with German Social Democratic Deputy Glotz, Zieleniec expressed  the opinion that Czech-German relations are better than they  were following the CSFR's breakup last January. Glotz, on the  other hand, thinks that these relations are worse than they were  two or three years ago.    The Czech Republic is now in many respects better prepared  to  enter the EU than the EU is to admit it, said Kurt Biedenkopf,  prime minister of Saxony, at the conference. According to him,  Germany will fully support the Czech Republic's entry into the  Union, not only by voting for it but also by means of real  cooperation and support for the Czech economy.    In the interest of creating a genuinely integrated Europe,  the EU states must put an end to manifestations of rampant  egoism, said Austrian Vice Chancellor Erhard Busek at the  conference. "We do not have enough common European values. We  lack a European spirit," he said in the debate.    The conference, held from 13 to 15 May, was attended by  important European political figures.</p>

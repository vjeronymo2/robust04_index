			<p>BFN     [Text] Today is the second day of Boris Yeltsin's official  visit to our country. The central point today is the signing of  several agreements, many of them of an economic nature, but  there is also an outstanding social debt that could lead to a  solution for the so-called children of the war. Those Spanish  citizens who left Spain for Russia as children, during or after  the Spanish Civil War, are now old and their pension status has  still not been resolved. Pedro Fernandez Cespedes reports from  the Moncloa palace:    [Fernandez Cespedes] The two leaders have described their  talks as very interesting. Yeltsin and Gonzalez also agreed  when they said that Hispano-Russian relations are good, but  there is much room for improvement. Furthermore, they are  certain--and it seems they have no doubt from what we have  heard--that the treaty of friendship and cooperation they signed  this morning in the Moncloa Palace is going to very quickly step  up Hispano-Russian relations. Yeltsin said this a few moments  ago while expressing his disbelief at the present state of  affairs.    The president of the Russian Federation does not understand  how trade between two great states--he thinks that the Spanish  state ranks third regarding the quality of life in the  world--does not reach two percent.    Gonzalez also highlighted the treaty of friendship and  cooperation as a channel that will politically and legally  regulate the treaties that have been signed during this visit.  As you know, one of these treaties allows the children of the  war to get their pension in Spain, and it will not be less than  the minimum established in our country. In short, this is a  treaty of friendship and cooperation that, according to the  Spanish prime minister, is going to be boosted annually and will  institutionalize Hispano-Russian summit meetings at the highest  level.    [Begin Gonzalez recording] This agreement contains the  commitment to hold at least two formal meetings between the  foreign ministers every year and a meeting at the highest level  every year. [end recording]    [Fernandez Cespedes] And, finally, to end with a human touch  but no less interesting. Boris Yeltsin has challenged all of us  here at the news conference to enjoy a state of health like his,  at the age of 57, by playing tennis and swimming in the Black  Sea with a water temperature of four degrees.</p>

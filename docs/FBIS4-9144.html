			<p>BFN     [Text] The Sejm has adopted a presidential veto against the  parish councils' electoral law. The president refused to sign  the law on the ground that its rules banning the election  campaign in churches had violated the principles of the  democratic state of law, equality before the law, and the  separation of church and state.    The president also considers lowering a threshold for  proportional representation as leading to the politicizing of  the local self-government elections.</p>

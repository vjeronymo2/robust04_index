			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. ACCUSED OF HELPING FOREIGN APPAREL FIRMS  </P> <P> The American apparel industry, which proudly sews "Made in the U.S.A." labels  on its products, has been hurt by U.S. government policies that favor foreign  competitors, a study said today.  </P> <P> The study, prepared by the Economic Policy Institute, concluded that the  federal government has "given away" large portions of the U.S. apparel industry  in pursuit of military or diplomatic goals.  </P> <P> "Having lost half of its domestic market, the U.S. apparel industry is now  teetering between survival and extinction," the study said. "It would not take  much to push many of the remaining firms out of domestic production."  </P> <P> With 1.6 million production workers, the U.S. textile and apparel industries  employ more Americans than any other industry, including steel, autos and  chemical refining combined.  </P> <P> The study said the setbacks suffered by the nation's apparel industry in recent  years have been a result of government policies that treat clothing makers as a  "sunset industry," or one that has fallen into a tailspin and can no longer  compete with low-cost foreign labor.  </P> <P> Richard Rothstein, the report's author, said the federal government has been  "reluctant to enforce" agreements to control the growth of apparel imports from  developing nations.  </P> <P> Rothstein also said the demands by the U.S. government and international banks  that debtor nations repay their loans have led to depressed wages in these  developing countries. This, in turn, results in lower-cost goods, which are  exported to the United States.  </P></p>

			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Sotheby's The decision by Sotheby's redoubtable chairman to reduce his shareholding by a third was bound to affect the company's share price. Mr Alfred Taubman will continue to hold 14m shares and has pledged to stay as chairman for a while yet. In addition, he has scarcely called the top of the market. Although his investment a decade ago in the auction house has proved astute, Sotheby's shares are a mere third of their price in late 1989. Granted, that is largely the result of the bursting of the bubble which drove prices for Impressionist paintings and toy cars to absurd levels. Equally, these days the big auction houses are less wedded to offering customers the financial incentives which spurred on their excesses. The question is whether the 12 per cent fall in the share price yesterday in London was the correct response. In reducing his stake, Mr Taubman is not giving up voting control. Moreover, the shares are difficult to value on fundamentals. This year's profits may reflect little more than a patchy improvement in the art market. Given that Sotheby's shares have outperformed those of Christies by a quarter this year, investors can hardly be blamed for wondering if Mr Taubman is belatedly cashing in after all.</p>

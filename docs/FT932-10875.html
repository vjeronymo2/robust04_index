			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: Redland upgraded The best performance in the FT-SE 100 came from Redland, the building materials group, after the top-rated Kleinwort Benson building sector research team lifted its earnings estimates for the company and upgraded its recommendation on the stock from 'hold' to 'buy'. At the close, Redland shares were 18p, or 3.85 per cent, higher at 468p, after relatively high turnover of 2.7m shares. Kleinwort was said to have lifted its 1993 pre-tax profits figures to Pounds 256m from a previous Pounds 225m, and its 1994 estimate to Pounds 310m from Pounds 270m. Shell Transport attracted a fresh burst of strong domestic buying interest yesterday, with two of the leading London-based securities houses said to have been aggressive supporters of the shares. They closed a further 6 higher at 562p, after good turnover of 5.6m shares. BP was not left behind, and settled 2 higher at 296p, stimulated by renewed demand prompted by NatWest Securities and also by sustained US buying interest. BP reports first-quarter figures this morning. NatWest is forecasting historic cost net income, including stock gains or losses of Pounds 230m, against last time's Pounds 61m loss. On a replacement cost basis, the broker is looking for net income of Pounds 220m against Pounds 95m. SGST, the French-owned broker, forecasts, pre-exceptional items, historic net income of Pounds 190m, or on a replacement cost basis, net income of Pounds 172m. The call by the electricity industry regulator - Offer - for the generators to account for their involvement in recent electricity pool price rises, unsettled the generators and also affected sentiment in British Gas. The latter eased 1 1/2 to 304p, while National Power dipped 2 to 321p and PowerGen 4 to 324p. Wellcome shares lost 11 to 728p on reports of a new rival to its AIDS drug AZT. Verex Laboratories of the US said preliminary tests showed its version of AZT could be more potent, longer-lasting and less toxic than Retrovir. Wellcome later announced that it was looking into the legality of the Verex claim. SmithKline Beecham fell 12 to 469p in the 'A's, in spite of an announcement that it is to co-promote a drug for US group Adria Laboratories. US investors appeared to be selling pharmaceuticals stocks and also continued unenthusiastic on ICI, which slipped 8 1/2 to 1264 1/2 p. The world's biggest mining group RTZ fell 14 to 631p as it held its annual meeting yesterday. The group said it expected no decisive improvement in operating results until 1994 and chart analysts were predicting little support for the stock before 550p. The shares have suffered recently from a weak copper price. A two-way pull in MFI saw the shares see-saw in heavy trade before finally settling 2 adrift at 137p. Turnover was a hefty 13m. BZW, the latest broker to return from visiting the discount furniture group, downgraded profit forecasts and reiterated its negative stance. Hoare Govett and UBS were said to be more positive. Shares in Burton Group came off a penny to 78 1/2 p following the placing of a line of 7m at 78p by Lehman Brothers. In a quiet food retail sector, Asda had its short-term debt upgraded by US credit agency Moody's. The shares closed a half-penny down at 69p. Tesco added the same to 218p, with some talk that one leading securities house had turned positive. Banana importer Geest collapsed following a profits warning, the shares off 68 at 366p after touching 328p. Coats Viyella shed 6 to 231p ahead of its annual meeting today. Sports clothing group Campari rebounded 12 to 145p following the slide prompted by Tuesday's profits warning. Lucas Industries rose 4 to 140p on unusually heavy trade of 6.3m shares amid renewed talk of a possible bid for the company. One analyst argued that the company's poor profit performance made it a viable bid candidate. The speculation has surrounded the company for some time with BTR being seen as a likely predator. BTR shares fell 5 to 592p. Trafalgar House, which reported a loss of Pounds 97.6m for the first-half compared to a profit of Pounds 54m previously, lifted 3 to 95p as the company signalled an upturn in property and increased investment in the Far East. Also board changes and general recovery prospects helped sentiment. More details of the BT III flotation, plus news that the company has terminated discussions with Electronic Data Systems, the US computing services group, failed to trigger any substantial flurry of interest in BT although the shares rallied from an early 401p to close only a fraction easier on balance at 404 1/2 p. Turnover was a good 6.3m.</p>

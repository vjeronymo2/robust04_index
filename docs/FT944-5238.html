			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / Architecture: Model for the millennium - Colin Amery on the high standards set by Westminster Cathedral Architecture and anniversaries seem to be inextricably linked, especially as we approach the millennium. The announcement last week that the Millennium Commission (which seems to be anxious to model itself on the Victorian Commissioners of the Great Exhibition of 1851) is planning to support 12 major capital projects around the UK with 50 per cent of its Lottery income, represents a major boost for architecture. In the recent past there would have been no hesitation about what kind of building you would erect to commemorate almost anything - you would build a church or a cathedral. Today the lack of certainty about any system of spiritual, rather than material, values makes commemorative buildings difficult to conceive. There have been too many great exhibitions that are usually meaningless in themselves, and they always result in empty 'expo' sites, littering the world with their fantasies. One only has to think of the Atomium in Brussels: the decaying geodesic domes from the New York World Fair on the road into that city from Kennedy Airport; the crumbling Habitat structures in Montreal and the collapsing remnants of Expo '92 - now looking for a use in Seville. How wise of the Hungarian Government to decide that it does not want to waste money on any great expo in Budapest, and that it would rather build more usefully and gradually for the future of the country. Although the Millennium Commissioners have asked for all submissions for these great capital projects to be of 'high architectural design and environmental quality', there is absolutely no guarantee or system of accountability that can reliably ensure that this is going to be the case. The curious English system of entrusting almost everything to a well meaning group of amateurs to judge the professionals has its virtues, but it also has its limitations. There are some lessons from the past that can be helpful when it comes to commissioning buildings and there is a particular centenary coming next year that is significant. The great Roman Catholic cathedral of Westminster will celebrate its first hundred years next year, and mark this event by an important architectural exhibition. It is significant that the catholic hierarchy in the 1890s attempted an architectural competition that was a complete failure. In the end they decided to choose the architect simply on the basis of the quality of his work. The choice of John Francis Bentley was inspired and appropriate. He understood both the aesthetic and functional ideas of the brief, and indeed the political significance of the building of a new catholic cathedral almost within the purlieus of Westminster Abbey. I think that Westminster Cathedral (left) is one of the great buildings of England. It is undoubtedly the greatest work of Bentley - and yet it is still a somewhat under appreciated masterpiece. It has, for me, all the qualities of a major piece of architecture. These qualities are due to the very simplicity of the idea behind the cathedral - it had to be cheaply built, as it was entirely funded by the contributions of the faithful, and it had one very clear purpose - not the triumphalism of the Church but the visibility of the celebration of the Mass. The cathedral is living proof of the continuation of the highest standards of craftsmanship in England. Many of the marble floors, for example, were only completed in the 1950s. The adoption of the Byzantine style for the cathedral was extraordinary at the end of the 19th century and there are those who would still consider it bizarre for London at the end of the 20th century. But it is such a miraculous building in the atmosphere it creates and the sense it gives of being, not in any sense a stylistic revival, but a place with an integrity that is entirely its own. There are not, as far as I can see, any plans for any new cathedrals to mark  -what is, after all, the Millennium of Christ. Indeed, in the Millennium Commissioners' report there is no mention of the Christian significance of the event at all. Perhaps they should give all the money raised from the lottery to the cathedrals of England - their need is great and there is no need at all for the nonsense that the commissioners are currently cooking up after their long tour of this island and their endless chats with the worthy. I can think of no more worthy cause than the restoration and endowment of the cathedrals of England for ever as a mark of the Christian Millennium. I notice that the atheistic report on the cathedrals that Lady Howe has just published is far more interested in the legal and 'management' aspects of the cathedrals than in their role as spiritual storehouses and beacons of enlightenment. It is my opinion that her report should be ignored and the example of the active, powerful and 'still under construction' 100-year-old cathedral of Westminster should be the model for this millennium and beyond.</p>

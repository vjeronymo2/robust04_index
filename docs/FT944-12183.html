			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / London Stock Exchange: BP weak on US influence A sense of anti-climax spread across the oils sector as British Petroleum shares retreated in the wake of the third-quarter figures and following a steep fall on Wall Street. BP hit all-time highs in sterling and dollar terms on Monday. Dealers said BP's third-quarter numbers were at the very top end of expectations but that the market had been mildly disappointed with the unchanged dividend, although some of the more conservative analysts said that hopes of an increase in the payment were unrealistic. It was also pointed out that BP shares had outperformed the market by 7 per cent over the past month and were due for a period of consolidation, albeit in a much higher trading band than has been the case in the past couple of years. Another bearish factor affecting BP was news that two of the influential Wall Street brokerages, Smith Barney and Prudential Bache, took the view that the oil majors are now overvalued. And at least two of the important London-based securities houses, including Goldman Sachs and NatWest Securities, were seen to be big sellers of BP shares yesterday. The stock retreated 9 to 426p on slightly disappointing turnover of 9.8m.</p>

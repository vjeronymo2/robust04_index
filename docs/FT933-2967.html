			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / People: Short-term occupation The fate of the Occupational Pensions Board hangs in the balance while the government's advisory body on occupational pensions, the Goode Committee, debates the future regulatory framework. The new chairman, Harriet Dawes, partner at Lovell White Durrant and a specialist in pensions law, acknowledges that she is in a caretaker role. Dawes, currently OPB deputy chairman, has been appointed to head the body until the end of the year following the retirement of Sir Jeremy Rowe. Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is to make a further announcement after reviewing the Goode Committee's recommendations, due to be submitted by the end of the month. For her part, Dawes says she is far too busy to take on the duties of the OPB permanently even if the body were to continue in its present form. But by all accounts, it will not. Dawes herself advocates a new regulatory structure and says that unlike the OPB, it should have powers to publicise wrongdoing, set fines or even revoke authorisation to run a scheme. 'If there is to be a regulator, it has got to be clear about whom it is trying to protect; government, members or the industry,' she says.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IMAGING YELLOW SUNS DECIDES TO REGROUP  </P> <P> After splitting apart in December over personal differences, the four members  of Orange County rock band Imagining Yellow Suns have decided to regroup.  </P> <P> "The problems aren't gone, but we've decided they're worth working out,"  singer-guitarist Ed Bernard said last week.  </P> <P> IYS, which put out a solid debut album for Dr. Dream Records last year, came to  a sudden halt when friction within the group led Bernard to leave. The other  members -- guitarist Steve Cross, bassist Tim Bugge and drummer Rob Fadtke --  decided to keep the band going, but auditions to replace Bernard proved  fruitless.  </P> <P> Bernard said the re-approachment came a couple of Sundays ago when he met with  his former band mates for the first time since the breakup.  </P> <P> "I really opened up as far as telling them how much I loved the band, and we  just hit a common ground," Bernard said.  </P> <P> "It was weird breaking up, and it was weird getting back," he added. "I think  this weirdness is going to be fertile grounds for some creative ideas." MIKE  BOEHM  </P></p>

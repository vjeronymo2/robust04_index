			<p>920323 FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Out of area - Ballot Box Scotland is once again acting as a proving ground for brave young Sassenach Tories who have not yet earned a winnable seat in England. The honour of fighting Glasgow Provan, one of the safest Labour seats anywhere, goes to 26-year-old Andrew Rosindell, from Romford, Essex. In 1987 the Conservative candidate - a Londoner - narrowly beat the Alliance for third place with less than 8 per cent of the votes. Labour took 73 per cent. This time fewer of the mini-biographies in the guide to Scottish Conservative candidates betray an English provenance than in 1987, but the birthplace and schools of some hopefuls are conspicuous by their absence.</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / Survey of Mobile Computing (9): Tadpole faces big rival - Portable Workstations Clive Thompson is a software engineer at British Telecom's Martlesham Heath research centre in Suffolk. He designs complex software systems to manage international data and telecom networks. This is not work that fits on a standard desktop PC. The prime tool of such software developers is the high performance workstation, characterised by the Sun computer. Running the Unix operating system, these machines give engineers the power to twist and test intricate patterns of figures - the number-crunching of computer lore. The dilemma for Mr Thompson is that his clients are BT senior managers, spread about the country. They are not always found next to a Sun workstation. Without that facility, it is impossible to demonstrate the latest step in network software. BT had to find a way to pick up a workstation and carry the demonstration around. The answer was a portable computer produced by Cambridge-based Tadpole Technology. Tadpole set out to fit a Unix-friendly chip into a small portable frame and came up with the Sparcbook. Sparc refers to the Unix chip developed by Sun and now in the domain of the Sparc International group, an industry combine including AT&amp;T. Tadpole began to deliver the Sparcbook in 1992, marketed as the ultimate in notebook sized PCs. The Sparcbook is not a cheap toy. Entry level machines cost Pounds 4,300, with more powerful models selling for up to Pounds 13,475. But it was the only option for BT staff who needed to transport and display sophisticated software. Using a network was not realistic, since Unix workstations would still be required to receive and run the program. Nor would carrying the software on disk, to be loaded up before each demonstration, work. 'You can't simply load and go as you would with a standard package,' Mr Thompson says. 'If I did that, I'd spend more time configuring it than carrying out the demonstration.' While BT is impressed with the Sparcbook, Mr David Thurgate, a technical analyst with Barclays Network Services, has reservations. Mr Thurgate tried to find a way of heaving a large Unix database about to keep executives up to speed outside normal office hours. The Sparcbook constituted 'a bit of a desperate solution'. Though the second, current, release of the product is an improvement, Sparcbook One was unable to emulate the graphics of the Sun workstation. 'The screen handling was not that good. It was a slow display connected to a fast computer.' In the event, Mr Thurgate decided that Unix in a briefcase was not right for executives hooked to this database. However, his software developers may have a use for the Sparcbook. 'We're not talking about people using it on a train. You'd use it to carry the database around and plug it into a fixed screen.' The high price of the Sparcbook was not a factor, however. Mr Thurgate believes that for highly technical applications the price tag is irrelevant. Tadpole has enjoyed a prominent role in bringing Unix out on the streets. But its comparative success, turning over Pounds 23m in 1993, has attracted competition. IBM will launch a Unix portable shortly. This will be aimed at customers of its RS6000 Unix machines who need to bring their software home at night. It will be based around the Power PC chip developed out of an alliance with Apple and Motorola. In its new and humbler incarnation, IBM admits to technical alliances with other suppliers. And the post-restructuring culture seems to have produced unaccustomed generosity among IBM executives. Mr John Barnes, IBM RS6000 product manager, praises Tadpole's contribution in opening up a niche market. 'There's a market for Unix portables because Tadpole has established it.' Perhaps that explains IBM's ambitions for its own Power Unix portable PC. IBM believes that enough people need the specialised strengths of Unix on the move and are willing to pay for the privilege. The substantial cost of this equipment has drawbacks for more than the company accountant. Theft is a major worry. But the institution that needs this capability tends to have deep pockets. Mr Michael Bentley, a systems administrator at merchant bank Merrill Lynch, is a Sparcbook user. The bank's staff has a nomadic existence and relies on Unix. 'Offshore Debt bought four, for around Pounds 9,000 apiece.' Is he concerned about small portable computers that approach the price of a company car? 'If we lose one, we write it off.'</p>

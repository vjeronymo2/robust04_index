			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] Under the headline "The Dangers of Reckless Israeli  Behavior," TISHRIN says in its editorial today: After the  signing of the Cairo agreement on the implementation of the Oslo  deal, Israel increased its aggression in southern Lebanon,  intensified its daily shelling of residential areas there, and  carried out a glaring act of piracy when it kidnapped a Lebanese  citizen, thus violating all international agreements and human  rights.    TISHRIN adds: It is worth noting that that terrorist  operation took place under the direct supervision of Yitzhaq  Rabin himself, something which proves that the Israeli political  and military decisionmaking is controlled by a terrorist  mentality. Moreover, Israel launched a savage raid on the  Ba'labakk area, and is now amassing more troops and equipment  and escalating its expansionist, aggressive language against  Lebanon.    The paper indicates that through that behavior Israel is  seeking to escalate regional tension, kindle war and aggression,  and ruin the peace climate in order to undermine the peace  process and destroy all its bases. Israel is also seeking to  undermine the process of national reconciliation in Lebanon,  thus reaffirming that it sought and still seeks to control  Lebanon and its resources. The paper stresses that separate  deals neither achieve peace in the region, nor provide peace and  stability for Arabs or restore their rights. Nor have they  ended Israeli intransigence, arrogance, and aggressive,  expansionist behavior.    The paper says that Israel has violated the principles of  the  peace process and is now pushing the region to war and  confrontation, thus defying the will of the international  community and the U.S. initiative for peace in the region.    The paper reiterates that Syria and the Arabs have joined  the  peace process to restore the occupied Arab territories and the  usurped Arab rights.    Concluding its editorial, TISHRIN says: If the international  community and the United States in particular are interested in  the success of the peace initiative, they must work to curb the  unruly aggressive Israeli behavior and to pressure the Israeli  Government into compliance with the principles of a just,  comprehensive regional peace.</p>

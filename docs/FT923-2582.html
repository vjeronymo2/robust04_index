			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Industry's leaders react with dismay LEADING UK industrialists reacted with dismay yesterday to the rise in interest rates before the announcement last night that the second increase would not take place. They also expressed fears that this would deal a further blow to consumer demand and deepen the recession. Most reluctantly accepted, however, that the government had little choice but to act as it did and supported its efforts to defend sterling's parity within the European exchange rate mechanism. 'We need 15 per cent interest rates like we need a hole in the head,' said Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry. 'But if it is a choice between that and devaluation, then I suppose it will have to be.' Nonetheless, some businessmen feared the pressure on sterling could make devaluation inevitable. A minority, led by Sir Owen Green, chairman of BTR, the industrial conglomerate, argued that sterling should be taken out of the ERM entirely. 'These are war conditions. We have to know what we are fighting for. Is it a British pound or a D-Mark pound?' Sir Owen said. 'If we start to devalue, all the precedents say we don't know what the rate should be. If we float, we know what the real value is for the British pound and call up the troops.' For most businesses, however, the most pressing concern was the outlook for demand. Some industry spokesmen argued that, almost regardless of what happened next, yesterday's events had inflicted a devastating blow to consumer demand. 'People will no longer be buying as of now. They will be stopped in their tracks,' said Mr Neil Marshall, economist at the Retail Motor Industry Federation. He warned of another round of business bankruptcies. Others said much depended on how long interest rates remained at crisis levels, and whether they passed through to mortgage rates. Several believed that it would be politically and economically impossible for the government to hold current interest rates for more than a few weeks. Several companies yesterday called on the government to take steps to revive the economy.</p>

			<p><P> October 20, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> BOND CORP. POSTS LARGEST LOSS IN AUSSIE HISTORY; GROWTH CITED  </P> <P> Bond Corp., the flagship company of Australian tycoon Alan Bond, today  announced the largest loss in Australian history.  </P> <P> Bond Corp. said it chalked up a net loss of $610 million in the year ending  June 30 after making a profit of $266 million in 1988-89.  </P> <P> Directors of the heavily indebted media, brewing and natural-resources company  blamed recent rapid growth for the results and insisted that it remains a  viable concern.  </P> <P> "Having fully considered all aspects of the company's state of affairs and  future cash flows the directors confirm absolutely that the company is  solvent," the corporation said.  </P> <P> Bond Corp.'s shares, avoided by larger institutions because of what they see as  Alan Bond's unpredictability, slid to 29 cents today from a year's high of  $1.87 in January.  </P> <P> The corporation said its rapid growth over the last few years had proved its  undoing, forcing it into a fire sale of assets totaling more than $3.5 billion  this year.  </P></p>

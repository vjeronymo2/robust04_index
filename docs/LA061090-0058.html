			<p><P> June 10, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> NUMBERS OF MIGRATORY BIRDS IN SHARP DECLINE;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: SUBURBAN TERRITORIES ARE ENCROACHING ON FEEDING GROUNDS.  SHOREBIRDS AND SONGBIRDS HAVE BEEN HIT PARTICULARLY HARD.  </P> <P> Shorebirds that migrate 7,000 miles between their winter homes in Argentina and  their Arctic nesting grounds make a pit stop every spring on New Jersey beaches  to feast on horseshoe crab eggs.  </P> <P> New Jersey also provides "safe houses" between wintering and nesting grounds  for many other types of migrating birds, including hawks that follow the  coastline, the Delaware River and Appalachian ridges and tiny warblers looking  for food in woodlands and coastal thickets.  </P> <P> Naturalists have noticed alarming declines in the feathered wayfarers. The  number of sanderling, a species of migrating shorebird, has dropped 50% in a  decade. Sharpshin hawk populations have fallen dramatically since the New  Jersey Audubon Society started counting in 1976, and songbirds are  disappearing.  </P> <P> New Jersey, the most densely populated state, is crossed by several major bird  routes, and birds are colliding with a human exodus to rural and shore areas.  Experts say the disappearing migrants are not only a loss for the Garden State,  but should serve as an early warning for the entire nation.  </P> <P> Audubon ornithologists blame the drop on increased development of rural and  coastal areas, which often eliminates bird habitat and erects such hazards as  airports, highways and plate-glass windows (which birds often fly into).  </P> <P> "The thing that humanity really has to do is ask itself a question: Are birds  important enough to want to protect?" said Pete Dunne, a veteran birdwatcher.  "If the answer is yes, then we'd better get with it, because it's going to be a  long road back."  </P> <P> Migrants are hard to protect because they are vulnerable at so many points.  Such shorebirds as the red knot and the sanderling could be wiped out by damage  to their nesting sites high above the Arctic Circle or to their wintering  range.  </P> <P> But they are at special risk during their long journey, when they cluster at  refuges like the Delaware Bay, where 80% of North America's sanderling and 40%  of the red knot gather in mid-May. The birds could not survive the grueling  flight without a chance to rest.  </P> <P> "Each link in the migratory path offers them something," said Kathleen Clark, a  zoologist with New Jersey's Division of Endangered and Non-Game Species.  "Delaware Bay is critical because the food supply is there in such abundance."  </P> <P> At Cape May, an average of 36,000 sharpshin hawks have been counted each year  since 1976, said Paul Kerlinger, director of the Audubon Society's Cape May  observatory. But the 1988 count was 19,000 and last year's was just above  10,000.  </P> <P> Kerlinger said the number of sharpshins counted at some inland observation  points has also gone down.  </P> <P> No one knows why sharpshin hawks are disappearing or even if the decline is  permanent or temporary. One hypothesis is that the songbirds they depend on for  food are dying off, Kerlinger said. Another factor could be plate-glass  windows, which appear to be a hawk-killer second only to hunting.  </P> <P> Sidney Gauthreaux, a Clemson University zoologist, uses old National Weather  Service radar records to track songbird migrations across the Gulf of Mexico  from Central America to Louisiana. He estimates that the number of birds making  the trip has declined 50% in the last 35 years.  </P> <P> Songbirds, which live mostly in deep woods, have been hit by deforestation in  the tropics and in the United States. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, strips of  woodland along beach areas provide resting places for migrants before and after  the flight to Central America, Gauthreaux said, but those "little refuges" are  now being cut.  </P> <P> Increasing suburbanization of New Jersey's rural areas, with office parks and  landscaped housing developments replacing forests, provides ideal habitat for  some wild species. Deer, raccoons, Canada geese and cow birds have become  pests. Both raccoons, which eat eggs, and cow birds, which use other species'  nests for their own eggs, play a part in killing off songbirds.  </P> <P> Chandler Robbins, a wildlife biologist at the Patuxent National Wildlife Refuge  in Maryland, observed that many species are doing just fine, spreading into new  territories. Cardinals have begun nesting in Massachusetts, while a new species  of cow bird is penetrating Southern states after moving from South America to  Puerto Rico, where it is crowding out native species.  </P> <P> But thrushes, vireos and many types of warblers are down.  </P> <P> To protect migrants, the Audubon Society suggests:  </P> <P> * Leave rural and shore property as natural as possible, protecting native  plants that provide food for birds.  </P> <P> * Limit or ban spraying for gypsy moths and mosquitoes. In addition to killing  pests, insecticides wipe out bugs that some birds eat.  </P> <P> * Cluster housing to preserve woodlands and limit development near the shore.  </P> <P> * Keep cats, which can be efficient bird killers, indoors. Prevent dogs from  running free.  </P> <P> * Design man-made hazards to accommodate birds. Plate-glass windows can be  angled downwards so that they do not reflect trees and sky. Red warning lights  on broadcast towers and skyscrapers attract birds and might be replaced with  white strobe lights, although that may aggravate humans.  </P></p>

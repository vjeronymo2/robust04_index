			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 25 (CNS) -- According to a sample  survey by the Shanghai Municipal Foreign Economic and Trade  Commission, the Municipal Legislative Office and the Municipal  Administration of Industry and Commerce on 727 foreign  institutions in the city, over 1,200 employees have been  illegally hired by their employers. Regarding this problem,  entities set up by Taiwan and Hong Kong businessmen are the most  serious.    The investigation shows that small-sized foreign-funded  companies have heavily involved in the above mentioned  activities. Employees working in these institutions and  companies, owing to failure of obtaining protection from labour  departments of the local governments, are generally earning a  comparatively low salary and even facing a threat of being  dismissed when they pass their best period of age. And because  of short of backing by an organizational institution, their  lawful rights and interests including pensions, medical charges,  insurance of unemployment, labour insurance for their families  and allowance for dismissal have also not been guaranteed.

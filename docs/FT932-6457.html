			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / The Cabinet Reshuffle: Tough operator a natural for No 11 KENNETH CLARKE chose himself. Once the pressure for Mr Norman Lamont's departure from Number 11 Downing Street became irresistible, Mr John Major had little choice but to call for the confident, combative and brash MP for Rushcliffe. The toughest job in the government demanded the government's toughest operator. At 52, Mr Clarke has emerged - Mr Douglas Hurd aside - as the strongest member of the cabinet. During the days of crisis following sterling's ejection from the European exchange rate mechanism, he was the one asked to tour the television studios to persuade a doubting world that the government would not disintegrate. From that point onwards, inside as well as outside the government, he has been the guardian of the cabinet's collective nerve. Never afraid to admit his ambition to be prime minister or to confess the government was in a mess  -he recently admitted the government was in a 'dreadful hole' - he has now been anointed Mr Major's heir apparent. Mr Major needs, above all, a credible economic policy. His government will stand or fall on its ability to persuade a bruised and bitter electorate that the pain of the recession will be followed by sustained economic recovery. Mr Clarke's elevation also offers the prospect of a pivotal and influential partnership with Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary. Mr Major's new industrial strategy, based on a partnership between government and industry to boost Britain's competitiveness, was always going to be inhibited by a less than totally convinced Treasury. Now, two ministers in key departments are of like minds over the need to engage government fully in the task of raising Britain's performance. Mr Clarke's appointment will win wide applause across the centre and left of the Tory party. But it is not without its risks. The new chancellor - a self-proclaimed pro-European and a staunch believer in the value of managed exchange rates - is deeply mistrusted by the recalcitrant Tory right. With the government's supporters at Westminster deeply divided by the battle over Maastricht, the right will demand guarantees - 'gold-plated' one said yesterday - that Mr Clarke will not seek to return sterling to the ERM. For the short-to-medium term, the new chancellor will be ready to reassure them. He remains committed to the principle of a stable exchange rate and believes Britain will not escape linking its currency to those of its partners. But he is politically astute enough to realise that the Tory party at Westminster would be broken irrevocably by an early return to the ERM. It was no accident that two weeks ago Mr Clarke said he saw little prospect of the pound rejoining the system before the next general election. The chancellor-in-waiting was reassuring the Conservative right. Nor does his reputation as a 'one-nation' Conservative (he is a prominent member of the Tory Reform Group) imply he will be soft on inflation, public spending or borrowing. Despite expectations of a 'softer' edge at the Treasury, Mr Clarke faces the same menu of unpalatable economic choices as his hapless predecessor. Like most of the generation of Tory politicians who could once be described as 'wet', he has long since been persuaded that 'caring Conservatism' is only possible if inflation is kept under control. Nor is he a conventional centrist - as the trade unions who dealt with him at health, education and the Home Office will attest. His first act as chancellor, therefore, will be a re-affirmation of the central policy objectives of containing inflation and of reducing the borrowing requirement. Close to the top of his agenda will be a decision on the vexed question of whether to extend the 1.5 per cent ceiling on public-sector pay - something he could well support. Friends say the government's political credibility alone means there is no prospect of any loosening of the public spending framework put in place by Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury. Nor does Mr Clarke have great room for manoeuvre over taxation. The increases announced by Mr Lamont in March would be impossible to reverse. Mr Clarke will, however, re-examine all the remaining tax options before November. And there might be a key difference with Mr Lamont. The new chancellor's friends believe that if he considers the level of borrowing still to be too high, the man who has religiously proclaimed the broader, economic benefits of lower personal taxation would consider at least a temporary rise in income tax. He can be fast on his feet; witness his recent about-turn on unit fines, performed with a stylish flourish admired by his backbenchers. His political opponents call him arrogant, callous and patronising and point to a patchy legacy which has failed to match the promise; his fans see a sharp mind and an all-important common touch. Mr Clarke has wanted the Treasury since sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM. Summoned to Admiralty House to share in the decision to withdraw the pound (one person present commented later that he had been asked 'to put his hands in the blood') he was horrified at the way the core of the government's economic strategy was being swept aside by the speculators. He told friends later that the technicians - the Treasury mandarins - had taken charge as the politicians stood by powerless. He was appalled when officials demanded that their political masters simply 'sign on the dotted line'. That reaction will be the key to the way he handles the Treasury. Above all Mr Clarke is a political activist. 'All I ever do is apply policies and principles which I believe are beneficial. The only thing that does a politician any good is to make a success of the job', he has said. The mandarins are in for a busy time.</p>

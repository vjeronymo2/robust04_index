			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Survey on A-Z of Computing (1): A snapshot of today's technology - Comment / The changes happening in computing now make it an ideal time to take a snapshot of the technology and the industry which supplies it THE IDEA of change has always been central to computing. Faster and cheaper computer hardware, innovative approaches to building software and better ways to make useful applications have flooded from the factories and laboratories of the computer industry for the last quarter of a century. But the appearance of constant change in computing has masked an industry and a technology which has changed very little. Most computing is still carried out on large mainframe computer systems which were designed in the 1960s and most of the world's business software is written in Cobol, a programming language which was conceived in the 1950s. Even the new wave of technology, represented by hardware innovations like reduced instruction set computers (see R for Risc) and operating systems software like Unix (see U), has its origins in the late 1960s. In the last year, however, genuine changes have become apparent and the new computer industry which has emerged in the 1990s is markedly different from the one which went before. The rules of the game, too, have been re-written. IBM, the dominant force in the industry since its birth in the 1950s, has cut thousands of jobs and, last year, declared the first losses in its history. Other large manufacturers - such as Groupe Bull, Unisys, DEC, ICL-Fujitsu - have fared no better. Many have sought salvation in joint ventures with former rivals - IBM's links with Bull and Apple being two examples. Software companies have been hit even harder. The British software industry - once the jewel in the crown of the UK's high technology industries - has almost disappeared, with once well-known names like CAP, Hoskyns and SD-Scicon all now in foreign ownership. The decline is not restricted to the UK. The consolidation of the software industry is a worldwide phenomenon - with many well-known names disappearing in the last couple of years - either through takeovers or mergers. The beleaguered chief executives of computer companies have blamed their bad fortunes on the world recession, but, although the recession has certainly aggravated the problem, the reality is, that a fundamental change was long overdue. Growing dissatisfaction with the high cost of information technology and frustration with the petty differences between rival suppliers' products has forced users to look closely at their investment in computing - and this has caused the first real change in the structure of the industry since its inception. The proliferation of personal computers, coupled with graphical user interface (GUI) software, has turned traditional wisdom on its head and put power in the hands of end users. Large computer systems are being replaced with networks of workstations connected by open systems architectures supporting downsized applications. The changes happening in computing now make it an ideal time to take a snapshot of the technology and the industry which supplies it. This is the underlying purpose of the Financial Times A to Z of Computing. In addition to the obvious task of explaining the obtuse jargon which characterises computing, this supplement aims to describe an industry in the process of change. From hardware innovations like reduced-instruction-set computers (risc) and new colour printing technologies, through emerging software technology such as computer-aided software engineering (CASE) and Unix, to structural changes in the industry itself, the A to Z of Computing sets the agenda for computing in the 1990s and beyond. It will be a valuable guide to all who need to know about computer technology in the future. And, in the 1990s, that means everyone.</p>

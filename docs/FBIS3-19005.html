			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Cologne (DPA) -- On Thursday [10 March], the  employers described the mediating committee's resolution on  nursing-care insurance as "the most severely wrong decision in  decades." Even now, because of the excessive social costs, the  introduction of additional social insurance to be financed  through compensation by employers and employees alike is  economically unacceptable, they said in a first reaction in  Cologne. It will be "fatal for the labor market." Moreover,  additional burdens would be shifted onto future generations that  will be impossible to bear in view of demographic developments.    "Thinking in terms of political prestige rather than  economic  reason has been the decisive factor," the Federal Association of  German Employers Associations said in its first comment on the  Bonn resolution. What is particularly disappointing is that,  with the agreement on compensation, the firm promise has not  been honored to define bindingly in advance the compensation for  employers' contributions for the second stage, too. "Since  industry and labor in the major economic areas are making a  considerable contribution to the protection of Germany as an  economic center, these efforts are now being undermined by the  state's social policy."</p>

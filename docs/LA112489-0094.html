			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FACTORY HAS SCOOP ON OLD-FASHIONED ICE CREAM;  </P> <P> FOOD: THE HERSHEY CREAMERY -- ONE OF THE LAST INDEPENDENT ICE-CREAM  MANUFACTURERS -- CONTINUES TO PRODUCE TIMELESS DAIRY TREATS.  </P> <P> It's a kid's fantasy: finding yourself inside an ice-cream factory where every  breath is like a swirling icicle and every taste lingers like the longest day  of summer.  </P> <P> In a world rapidly being taken over by fancy-schmancy ice creams with foreign  names and butterfat contents in the stratosphere, it's nice to know that a more  traditional, comforting place exists. A place where there are 10-cent orange  Popsicles, ice-cream sundaes with drizzles of chocolate -- a place where every  Nutty finds its Buddy.  </P> <P> This is the Hershey Creamery, an ice-cream factory (not related to the Hershey  Foods Co.) near the banks of the Susquehanna.  </P> <P> The Hershey Creamery -- one of the last remaining independent ice-cream  manufacturers in the nation -- has been in operation since 1894 and is still  selling mostly to mom-and-pop groceries in the Northeast. It has been run by  the Holder family since the 1960s and is now run by the Holder brothers, Walter  and George Jr.  </P> <P> They were the lucky kids who got to spend the hottest summer days inside the  cool factory. Those were the preautomated days, before the gleaming white  mixing tanks would swoosh all the basics -- milk, sugar and corn syrup -- at  the touch of a button.  </P> <P> Perhaps you want to stop reading now, especially if you don't want to know a  thing about ice cream, except the next time you're going to eat some, but  consider this: As a nation, we collectively eat almost 1 billion gallons a  year. The biggest ice-cream consumers are in the Northeast, followed by  Californians.  </P> <P> People are always trying to figure out why we love it so much, why it remains  our No. 1 favorite dessert. Self magazine even tried to explain the  psychological hook of ice cream, and as you probably guessed, it's all related  to childhood. "When you're good as a child, the reward is often an ice-cream  cone," said Dean Krahn, director of the Eating Disorders Clinic at the  University of Michigan.  </P> <P> Some explanations are simpler. Many of us remain little kids; some of us are  remembering the sound of bells, first distant and then closer, signaling the  arrival -- "Hurry up, Mom" -- of the ice-cream truck on our corner. Some  remember the old-fashioned drugstores and parlors we went to, the kind where  they used to give out free ice-cream sundaes on your birthday.  </P> <P> So, if you don't want to spend a day at the ice-cream factory, if you don't  want your pleasures demystified, then don't read any further.  </P> <P> But maybe you'd like to come along for the tour at the Hershey's Creamery, a  large modern factory, where the temperatures can dip to 40 degrees below zero.  </P> <P> In a 24-hour, peak summer cycle, the equivalent of 50,000 gallons a day will be  produced in the form of 3-gallon containers, half gallons, pints, quarts and  two dozen ice-cream novelties, including the most popular -- Nutty Buddy cones  and chocolate-wafer-covered ice-cream sandwiches.  </P> <P> Inside the factory, almost everywhere you turn, it's white and the floors are a  little wet, a byproduct of the machines churning and spewing.  </P> <P> About 225 people work here during the summer, most of them on the assembly  lines, where they watch ice-cream bars come parading by the dozens, toss out  the drippy ones, and package everything. Ice cream comes oozing out of  Flex-Fill cylinders merging in a perfect balletic turn with cones, nuts, syrup  and paper. The smell can be sticky-sweet, like overripe strawberries that have  been in an airless room too long. The constant clackety-clack is not unlike 100  manual typewriters going at full speed.  </P> <P> Two women sit opposite each other, between them a short conveyor belt. Orange  Squeezeup tubes, wrapped in blue-and-orange silvery paper, come four at a time.  Each woman takes her turn. In less than a minute, she will have put a dozen  tubes into a box.  </P> <P> Two dozen wooden Popsicle sticks appear on the horizon on the Vita-Line  machine. Next, they are covered with orange ice. Then they disappear for a  moment. The next time you see them they are covered in paper. They come off the  machine like little toy soldiers, then down the conveyor belt they go, where  another woman will catch them and stuff them into boxes.  </P> <P> In its simplest form, without giving away any trade secrets, here's how the  process works every day during the peak season: At 3 p.m. each day, the raw  ingredients are brought by trucks and poured into multistory silos. For the  day's production, the factory will need 100,000 pounds of cream, 100,000 pounds  of skim condensed milk, 50,000 pounds of liquid cane sugar and 50,000 pounds of  liquid corn sugar.  </P> <P> Tubes from the silos lead into the mixing areas where, at 7 p.m., the  ingredients -- including 500,000 gallons of water -- are blended, pasteurized  and homogenized, stabilized and emulsified in 500-gallon batches, containing  varying percentages of the products. They are then transferred to 20 holding  containers. It's all timed by computer and operated with the touch of a button.  This process can handle 4,000 gallons of ice cream an hour. (A product can only  be classified as ice cream, according to federal regulations, if it includes at  least 10% solid milk products. Most ice cream contains from 10% to 16%, which  is considered premium ice cream. Low-fat and frozen dessert products are also  made at this plant.)  </P> <P> At 4 a.m. (and later in the process as well), samples from the mixtures pass  through the quality control lab, which looks like a well-stocked college lab  room. In this lab, four technicians test the mixtures in petri dishes for 24  hours for safety and the products in finished form for flavor and texture.  Leftovers are stored in the lab freezer for employees.  </P> <P> At 5 a.m., the mixtures are pumped into the 20 flavor vats. There are more than  100 flavors including butterscotch ripple and peanut butter cup. (Vanilla still  corners 25% of the market with chocolate just under 10% and strawberry at 6%.)  These flavor vats are swirls of cream and goo. The chocolate syrup for  flavoring and dipping is made in another part of the creamery.  </P> <P> After 5 a.m., the production of novelty ice-cream products as well as the  packaging of flavors begins. Every day, specific consumer demands are met, from  Popsicles to brownie sundaes.  </P> <P> Yes, they're trying to appeal to sophisticated tastes, said George Holder, the  vice president in charge of production. "We just try to keep up with the times.  It's a very competitive business we're in here."  </P> <P> Here's what the factory produces in a 24-hour period:  </P> <P> At the two stick novelty machines in 18-hour shifts: 25,000 dozen orange  Popsicles and 25,000 dozen Strawberry Scooter bars.  </P> <P> 5,000 orange Squeezeups in an eight-hour shift.  </P> <P> 8,000 three-gallon ice-cream cartons.  </P> <P> 10,000 dozen Nutty-Buddy cones in an 18-hour shift.  </P> <P> 10,000 dozen ice-cream sundae cups.  </P> <P> 30,000 half gallons of ice cream in a 10-hour shift.  </P> <P> 50,000 pints of ice cream.  </P> <P> After the ice cream is packaged, it is then sent for two hours through the  hardening tunnel -- a long passageway -- that is kept at 40 degrees below zero.  After that, the ice cream is stored in an enormous hardening room kept at 20  degrees below zero.  </P> <P> Soon the trucks will come and take the finished product away. And somewhere,  some kid is clutching a few quarters and is ready to take a walk to the corner.  </P></p>

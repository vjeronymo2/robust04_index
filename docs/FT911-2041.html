			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Technology: Offshore haven for nuclear waste As plans for an underground radioactive waste repository are drawn up in Britain, engineers in Sweden are preparing to build on the early success of a similar project. Caverns have been created under the Baltic Sea at a capital cost of Pounds 70m to provide a final resting place for much of the radioactive waste from the country's 12 nuclear power reactors. The material going into the caverns off Forsmark, on Sweden's east coast, about 80 miles north of Stockholm, consists of waste which will be dangerously radioactive for the relatively short term, several hundreds of years. Most of it is low-level waste, such as contaminated overalls and gloves but some is intermediate-level waste, including sludges and resins. SKB, the Swedish radioactive waste disposal company, is planning to build a much deeper repository for long-lived intermediate-level and high-level wastes which may remain dangerously radioactive for millions of years. A short list of sites is expected to be announced next year and the facility could be ready for use by the year 2020. IS Nirex, SKB's equivalent in Britain, is currently boring into the rock structures at Sellafield, in Cumbria, and Dounreay, in Scotland, to check the geology before the announcement of a preferred site for its own deep repository. However, it will cater only for low and intermediate-level wastes. Under present proposals, all high-level waste will continue to be stored on the surface at Sellafield, where spent nuclear fuel is re-processed by British Nuclear Fuels. Nearby, in the village of Drigg, is British Nuclear Fuels' low-level waste repository, expected to be full by the middle of next century. Sellafield is likely to be the preferred choice for Britain's deep repository, although no formal announcement is due before October. The Nirex idea is to sink a vertical shaft about 700 metres deep and create a series of caverns running from its base and capable of holding 1.4m cubic metres of waste. It will cost an estimated Pounds 800m to build and a further Pounds 1.6bn to operate over 50 years. In 1994 the UK Government is due to carry out a review of nuclear power economics following its decision two years ago not to finance further stations after Sizewell B, in Suffolk. Whether or not nuclear power is allowed to expand, a large amount of radioactive waste has already been created. Much more will arise before the existing stations reach the end of their lifetimes and are dismantled. A public inquiry into the Nirex plan for a deep repository is expected to start in 1993 and last for a year. In the meantime, the company will continue its efforts to try to convince the public that underground waste disposal is practical and safe. Councillors from both Dounreay and Cumbria have been taken to Sweden to inspect the Forsmark repository, which is close to three nuclear power reactors. The repository is approached by two tunnels, each one kilometre long, which slope down through bedrock about 50 metres beneath the sea. The waste from the rest of Sweden's nuclear plants, all located on the coast, is brought to Forsmark by ship. All waste arriving at the facility is already packaged in concrete or steel. It is placed in concrete vaults which are surrounded by bentonite clay. In its first three years of operation, the repository has accumulated about 6,000 cubic metres of waste, one-tenth of its present capacity. When it was opened it was thought that additional cavern space would have to be created in order to cater for future operating waste. However, engineers now believe the existing space will suffice, largely because of new compaction techniques being used at the power stations before despatch of the waste to Forsmark. New caverns and an additional silo will be necessary to cope with the low and intermediate-level waste from the dismantling of the reactors at the end of their operating lifetimes. SKB, which is owned by the four Swedish nuclear power utilities, estimates it will cost Pounds 5bn to de-commission the country's nuclear power stations and dispose of the radioactive waste involved. Operational and de-commissioning waste is expected to total about 230,000 cubic metres. The Swedish parliament decided after a national referendum in 1980 to phase-out nuclear power by the year 2010. Three years ago it said plants would begin shutting down in 1995. However, the start of the phase-out has now been postponed because of the difficulty in finding acceptable replacement sources of electricity. Coal and oil have been ruled out because of the problems of global warming and acid rain, while further hydro schemes have also run into environmental opposition.</p>

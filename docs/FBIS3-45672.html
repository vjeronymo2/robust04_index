The priorities will be mainly in the fields of the  automobile, electronics and new building materials industries,  as well as urban infrastructure, deep processing of farm and  farm side-line products, and the service sector.    Beijing will encourage foreign investors to engage in  production of less-energy-consuming, high value-added and  high-tech products.    Investment in real estate development linked with the  reconstruction of old urban areas, and construction of  commercial, consultancy, information and tourism facilities is  also welcomed.    It will export fine varieties of fruit trees, vegetables,  poultry, and deep-processing equipment and techniques for farm  products.    More overseas funds will be guided into high-tech and  export-  oriented products, and technical upgrading of old industrial  enterprises.    As the political, cultural and international exchange center  of the country, Beijing made marked progress in industrial  output value, house construction and profits made by the service  sector last year.    The city is also the country's biggest hub of  communications.  It has 19 railway lines with a total annual handling capacity  of over 45 million tons, and 2,037 highways with a total length  of over 10,000 km, of which more than 100 km are express  highways.    It has 85 air routes to nearly 40 cities in 29 countries,  IDD  [international direct dialing] service to 96 countries and  regions, and postal service to 207 cities in 120 countries and  regions.    Last year the city approved the setting up of 3,752 foreign-  funded enterprises with total foreign investment of 6.28 billion  U.S. dollars. The investors are from over 60 countries and  regions.    By the end of last year over 600 foreign-funded firms had  gone into production.</p>

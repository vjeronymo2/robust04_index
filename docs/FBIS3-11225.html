			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sao Paulo, Brazil (EFE) -- Upon installing three new  Parlatino [Latin American Parliament] committees today, Senator  Luis Rubeo stated that Latin American countries must learn to  negotiate and to impose their competitive advantages.    Only in learning how to negotiate at the regional level, the  Argentine senator said, will Latin American nations have the  opportunity to "impose their rights and defend their  production," including in a general manner the possibility of  joining a free trade agreement, which should include not only  North America, but all the Americas.    "It is necessary for Latin America to elevate the sights of  its negotiating capability when it is a question of imposing its  rights and defending its regional production, where financial  flows have the advantage over the flow of trade products," Rubeo  added.    "It is necessary," he added, "for Latin America to impose  its  competitive advantages in continuing the fight for our rights to  trade regional production, without obstacles, in order to  correct the region's trade imbalance, which continues to be  financed with foreign debts."    "The eventual joining of a more ample integration process  that would link the entire American continent in the immediate  future, for example the economic area that has been created by  NAFTA, requires a capability for negotiations that can only be  acquired at a regional level," he said.    Rubeo termed encouraging the advances in the negotiations to  bring in line the Andean Group, the Group of Three, the Latin  American Economic System, and the Common Market of the South  (Mercosur).    The Argentine senator presented his discourse to some 30  congressmen from the 24 countries making up Parlatino, who began  their meeting today to begin the work of the three new  committees. The meeting, which is being held at the  organization's permanent seat in Sao Paulo, will conclude 18  March.    With the installation today of the Subregional, State,  Municipal, and Provincial Affairs Committee; the Economic  Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Debt Affairs Committee; and the  Social Debt Committee, Parlatino now has 16 functioning  committees.    According to Rubeo there are now only two of the 18  committees left to be installed, while the Narcotics Committee  has progressed most in its tasks.    This committee has already prepared an extradition and  repression treaty against illegal chemicals (precursors for the  manufacture of drugs), which must be studied and voted on by the  congresses of all Latin American nations so that it can be  implemented.    In his address Rubeo referred to the adverse social economic  conditions that are being experienced by Latin America, which  are a threat to democracy.    The Argentine senator stated that the institutionalization  of  regional integration into trade blocs "expands the support bases  of our democracies, and creates power resources for each  subregion and for Latin America as a whole."</p>

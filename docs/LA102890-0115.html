			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART;  </P> <P> TOO MUCH PICASSO, TOO LITTLE 'ALLEY OOP'  </P> <P> Right now, the Museum of Modern Art has Zap Comics on display. Also "Alley  Oop," "Heart Throbs," "Men of War," Mad magazine and Cadillac's 1956 ad for  "the greatest advancements it has ever achieved in motor car styling and  engineering!"  </P> <P> This may sound like fun-house, turn-the-tables thrills to you. It is also  amazing coming from the Bauhaus headquarters of the high-taste police. The  exhibition is called "High &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture." So  naturally it stars Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol  and Jenny Holzer.  </P> <P> It is all about the love-hate relationship between high art and the mass  culture of a mechanized age. But this is no modern romance; it is a class war.  And winner takes all. What we have here is just one more version of that  time-honored art world formula: Need new blood? Get the lower classes!  </P> <P> Call it the Caravaggio equation, after the 17th-Century painter who rescued the  art of Rome from an overdose of manners by recruiting nasty adolescent street  toughs to pose for his pictures.  </P> <P> When artists need to breathe life and blood into art-gone-stale, they invite in  the real world. So why not an art institution?  </P> <P> Particularly now, when the Museum of Modern Art has just completed its changing  of the guard. The old regime, led by William Rubin, emeritus director of the  department of painting and sculpture, defined modern art as an increasingly  abstract and cerebral continuum from Cezanne through Picasso to Stella.  </P> <P> This made for some dazzling exhibitions, from "The Late Cezanne" to the  museumwide "Picasso" retrospective. But that left the museum hopelessly blind  to the art of the last 25 years, which is seldom abstract and which shudders at  the whole idea of progress.  </P> <P> Then, two years ago, enter the new painting and sculpture director, Kirk  Varnedoe. When it comes to defining modern art, he comes squarely down on the  side of both modernist tradition and idiosyncratic inclusiveness in his recent  book "A Fine Disregard."  </P> <P> "The rules of the game are not something you play by," he wrote. "They're  something you play with."  </P> <P> Unfortunately, play is not the operating principle of the High-Low show, which  is, in effect, Varnedoe's solo debut at MOMA -- though he picked a collaborator  to help, New Yorker writer Adam Gopnik.  </P> <P> Varnedoe's other MOMA exhibition, "Vienna 1900," was a reconstituted version of  a Viennese predecessor, and he collaborated with Rubin on the "Primitivism"  exhibition, which wanted to show how modern art borrowed from tribal cultures.  </P> <P> "Primitivism" was gorgeous and controversial. "Vienna" was stunning, and staged  with the theatricality of an operetta.  </P> <P> Either controversy or theatricality surely would have helped High-Low. Instead  we get Cubism, lots of Cubism. It's as if Varnedoe is telling Rubin -- whose  last exhibition was "Picasso-Braque: Pioneering Cubism" -- what the old boy  left out. And what the old boy left out, in the new world of revisionist art  history, is social context and iconography. Those words that Picasso and Braque  introduced into their paintings meant something: They came from ads and  newspapers, and the artists were really punning it up. When they cut "urnal"  from "Le Journal," according to this exhibition, they were  </P> <P> making a schoolboy reference to urinals.  </P> <P> So the show starts out with a reproduction of the sort of newspaper-loaded  kiosk that Picasso and Braque might have encountered, which is cute; there are  also a lot of blown-up newspapers and ads circled in red where the artists  appropriated something. So far so good.  </P> <P> But there is far too much Picasso and far too little "Alley Oop" at the MOMA.  The comic books and car ads haven't been invited in to reinvigorate the place.  Except in that very first Cubism part, they are merely there to serve their  betters.  </P> <P> They are there the way you get little thumbnail black-and-white plates in art  history books that relate a full-colored painting to its sources. You mean Roy  Lichtenstein borrowed from comic books? Gosh! And there's Lichtenstein after  Lichtenstein to compare with some of the hardly doctored comics from which he  borrowed. You have to turn to the catalogue to learn that both Lichtenstein and  the Cubists were revitalizing popular forms ("Young Romance" and "Army at War"  were about to be blown away by feminism and the Vietnam War). But no  speculation as to why.  </P> <P> When we get to the graffiti part of the show, there isn't a single example of  real subway graffiti on view. Not to mention the  street-graffiti-kids-turned-art-world-heroes whom MOMA disdains to recognize.  Not even Keith Haring. Instead there are a great many of Jean Dubuffet's  brutally scrawled post-Holocaust paintings, and Cy Twombly's calligraphic  version of Abstract Expressionism in graffiti dress. And who wouldn't welcome a  chance to see so much good Dubuffet and Twombly in one place? It's just that  this context turns them into cliches.  </P> <P> What would really be new would be to see a De Kooning "Marilyn Monroe" here, or  a "Woman" with the mouth he cut from a Camels ad. But you're not going to see  Abstract Expressionism in a show like this. Not even Ad Reinhardt's scurrilous  cartoons lampooning the art world. That would go against received opinion, and  received opinion is what this show is all about.  </P></p>

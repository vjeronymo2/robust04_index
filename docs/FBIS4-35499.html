			<p>BFN     [Text] The Congress-I claims that the voter has put stamp  of approval on the policies, programs and performance of the  party in the just concluded by-elections. Talking to  newspersons in New Delhi today, the party spokesman, Mr. V.N.  Gadgil, said it is significant that five of the Lok Sabha  constituencies, which Congress-I has won, are all rural  constituencies and thus prove that rural people and farmers have  rejected the opposition propaganda about Dunkel proposals.    Describing by-elections as trend setter, Mr. Gadgil, however  ruled out the possibility of early general elections in the  country.</p>

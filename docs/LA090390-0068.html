			<p><P> September 3, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAVAJOS DEFEND REDFORD'S CASTING OF PHILLIPS  </P> <P> An organization representing Navajo Indians has come to the defense of Robert  Redford's casting of Lou Diamond Phillips as a Navajo policeman in "The Dark  Wind," which came under fire late last week.  </P> <P> The casting of Phillips, who is part Cherokee, was protested by the American  Indian Registry for the Performing Arts, according to a wire-service report  from Window Rock, Ariz., the Navajo tribe's capital, where the film will begin  shooting next Monday.  </P> <P> The 28-year-old Phillips, who is featured as a Navajo-Mexican in the current  "Young Guns II," will play patrolman Jim Chee in the film based on New Mexico  author Tony Hillerman's novel.  </P> <P> Bonnie Paradise, director of the registry, was reported to be planning to meet  with Redford and Phillips within the next three weeks.  </P> <P> "Mr. Redford has bought the (rights to several) books from Mr. Hillerman and  knowing there are other films down the line that follow the same story line, we  are concerned," Paradise was reported as saying.  </P> <P> The Navajo Nation said Friday that it was "sympathetic to the concerns of the  American Indian Registry for the Performing Arts, but we have already  established a working relationship with the filmmakers and will assist them in  any way to complete the 'Dark Wind' film.  </P> <P> "The producers . . . choose actors they feel will promote their production,"  said LeNora Begay, press officer for the Navajo Nation. "However, we as a  tribal government cannot oppose their decisions. All we ask is that they be  sensitive to our needs, culture and language in making films based on the  Navajo."  </P> <P> Phillips' publicist, Eddie Michaels, suggested that the controversy came about  because of Redford's stated intent that he would find a full-blooded Native  American for the leading roles. "Lou is a victim of casting," Michaels said.  Philips was in a local hospital recovering from complications of a  tonsillectomy and unavailable for comment, Michaels said.  </P> <P> A production executive for "The Dark Wind" said that another leading role in  the film will be played by actor Gary Farmer, who is a full-blooded Mohawk.  Navajos will be cast in a number of other roles, he said.  </P></p>

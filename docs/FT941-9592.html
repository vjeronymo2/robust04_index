			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Company News (This Week): Hanson's swings and roundabouts - Other companies Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, reports first-quarter results on Tuesday. A wide range of forecasts reflects many uncertainties: the cost of the US coal strike; the severity of the negative swing on interest charges; the contribution from Quantum Chemical, acquired at the end of the last financial year; and the effect of exchange rates. Hopes are for a modest underlying rise from last time's Pounds 216m, excluding Pounds 20m of disposal profits. No increase in the quarterly dividend is expected, although the chairman's statement should be fairly upbeat.</p>

			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television The children featured in 'Sheriff Street Kids', today's documentary in C4's Short Stories series, are the sort who have grown up with truancy and car theft as major parts of their lives. They live in a run-down area of central Dublin and dote on racing pigeons. The programme follows two boys, Madser and Docker, as they prepare to race their birds from Bray to Sheriff Street (8.00). ITV begins a three-part drama, All Or Nothing At All, in which comedian Hugh Laurie plays a charming City con man, addicted to gambling. He risks his friends' money on the horses in an attempt to make them a lot of money and therefore, as he supposes, happy (9.00). In Bottom, being repeated on BBC2, Adrian Edmondson and Rik Mayall play characters not far removed from their roles in The Young Ones. This will not be to everyone's taste, but if you do happen to enjoy their pee-po-belly-bum-drawers routine this is the most vigorous example yet to reach the screen. Today's episode with Rik's birthday party is like a pantomime with which Joe Orton has been interfering (9.00).</p>

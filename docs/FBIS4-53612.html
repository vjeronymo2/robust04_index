			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Foreign Ministry Pushes Japan's Bid for </F> Permanent Membership on the UN Security Council"]    [Text] At least one task has surfaced abruptly and  noticeably within the Hata government--the issue of Japan  joining the UN Security Council as a permanent member.    In his policy speech to the Diet and in statements made  during his stay in foreign nations, Prime Minister Hata has  frequently mentioned Japan's bid for permanent membership on the  UN Security Council. At a Brussels news conference, he said:  "Japan is being asked by the rest of the world to fulfill its  duty as a permanent member of the UN Security Council." His  rhetoric contrasts with that of the Hosokawa government, which  mentioned Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN  Security Council in guarded and indirect terms.    There are reasons why Hata makes frequent mention of Japan's  bid for permanent membership on the UN Security Council.    In contrast to the Foreign Ministry, which has been eager  for  Japan to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council,  neither the Hosokawa nor the Miyazawa governments were very  keen. Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary in the  Hosokawa government, and Yohei Kono, president of the opposition  Liberal Democratic Party, have also been negative about Japan  becoming a permanent member. At a meeting of the task force  mandated to reform the UN Security Council, Yoshio Hatamo,  former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, delivered a  speech which made very clear Japan's eagerness to join the UN  Security Council. In reaction, however, then Chief Cabinet  Secretary Takemura quite openly expressed his discontent with  the speech.    Nonetheless, the Foreign Ministry did not back down.  Whenever leaders of other nations visit Japan, the ministry  tries to include expressions of their support for Japan's  permanent membership on the UN Security Council in joint  statements and news releases. The Foreign Ministry has steadily  created a climate in which Prime Minister Hata could justly  state: "Japan is being asked by the rest of the world to  fulfill its duty as a permanent member of the UN Security  Council."    The way the Foreign Ministry has handled the issue of  Japan's  bid for permanent membership, though, appears to have toughened  Mr. Takemura's attitude.    The foreign minister moved to the Prime Minister's Official  Residence after a change of government. Ichiro Ozawa, secretary  general of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], who maneuvered  behind the scenes for Mr. Hata's promotion to the premiership,  is eager for Japan to expand its international contributions,  including its military contribution. It can be said that,  inspired by Mr. Ozawa's eagerness for Japan to make  international contributions, the Foreign Ministry has moved to  trumpet the need for Japan's permanent membership on the UN  Security Council.    But why has the Foreign Ministry clung to Japanese  affiliation with the UN Security Council? One reason we can  cite is the statement made by Under Secretary General James  Jonar [name as published] of the United Nations that "the UN  Security Council is now being transformed into a board of  directors." The General Assembly of the United Nations, with  more than 180 members, has been too slow in taking action and  that the UN Security Council is about to become a body mandate  in the management of international issues.    Three years ago the UN Security Council held weekly  sessions,  now it holds them daily, with the exception of holidays. Most  of the session is given over to informal discussion. Japan is  the biggest financial contributor to the United Nations,  following the United States, but Japan has to wait outside the  door of the UN Security Council. It is not strange, then, that  even Foreign Ministry officials say: "We want to see Japan  attending sessions in the capacity of a full, permanent member."    However, the question remains, "what can Japan do after  becoming a UN Security Council permanent member."    The U.S. Senate adopted in late January this year a  supplementary resolution asserting that "Japan should not be  allowed to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council  unless it is prepared to participate in UN peacekeeping  operations (PKO) including the use of force."    French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe, who visited Japan in  March this year, said: "The permanent member nations of the UN  Security Council have both rights and obligations. They have an  obligation to participate in PKO when it is decided by the UN  Security Council."    Although Japan has to positively work to join the UN  Security Council, the question of whether Japanese laws  currently in force are compatible with Japanese affiliation with  the UN Security Council as a permanent member still remains  unanswered. Revamping those laws will have much to do with  Japan's exercise of its collective right to self-defense, the  topic of frequent debate at home. If Japan fails to make clear  its attitude toward revamping those laws and exercising its  collective self-defense right, it would cause misgivings among  Japanese and misunderstanding among other nations.    It is already known that the United States supports both  Japan and Germany becoming permanent members of the UN Security  Council in the hope that they will increase their financial  contributions to the United Nations. Other nations, too, hope  to become permanent members of the UN Security Council and there  are no rational criteria for deciding one rather than another.  In addition, developing countries have demanded reform of the  UN Security Council.    The bluebook on foreign policy released on 13 May points out  the "slow pace" of the response by Japanese news media and the  Japanese to international expectations of the country, saying:  "Awareness in Japan has failed to keep pace with the  international community's growing expectations of Japan."    We have the impression that the Foreign Ministry has been  pushing the issue of Japan's bid for permanent membership of the  UN Security Council unilaterally.</p>

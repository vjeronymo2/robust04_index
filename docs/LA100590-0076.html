			<p><P> October 5, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Saying the evidence just isn't strong enough, federal prosecutors confirmed  Thursday that they have decided not to prosecute six San Diego County sheriff's  deputies in the 1988 choking death of a Latino jail inmate.  </P> <P> A "careful review" prompted the conclusion that the deputies lacked criminal  intent in the death of Albert Varela, 28, of Lakeside, federal prosecutors said  in a three-paragraph letter announcing the decision not to prosecute the six  deputies.  </P> <P> Varela died after a fight with deputies in the downtown County Jail, and U.S.  Attorney William Braniff said in an interview that the fight "certainly was a  confrontational situation." But there was not enough proof that the deputies  acted with the intent to harm Varela, Braniff said.  </P> <P> The outcome of the lengthy federal investigation, disclosed Thursday in The  Times, follows earlier reviews by the Sheriff's Department and the county  district attorney that cleared the deputies of wrongdoing.10/05/90  </P></p>

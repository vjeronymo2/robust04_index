			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN COMFORTS: THE SUPERIORITY OF A GOOD COUNTRY BREAKFAST;  </P> <P> TRADITIONS: IN EVERY CORNER OF THE SOUTH AND IN EVERY SEASON OF THE YEAR, THE  FIRST MEAL OF THE DAY IS RARELY TAKEN LIGHTLY. SOME REMEMBRANCES FROM NATIVE  SONS AND DAUGHTERS.  </P> <P> "In the morning they rose in a house pungent with breakfast cookery, and they  sat at a smoking table loaded with brains and eggs, ham, hot biscuits, fried  apples seething in their gummed syrups, honey, golden butter, fried steaks,  scalding coffee. Or there were stacked buttercakes, rum-colored molasses,  fragrant brown sausages, a bowl of wet cherries, plums, fat, juicy bacon, jam."  </P> <P>  -- THOMAS WOLFE, "LOOK HOMEWARD ANGEL"  </P> <P> It was his own waking to the seductive aromas of breakfast in his mother's  Asheville, N.C., boarding house that author Thomas Wolfe remembered so vividly.  Wolfe was not the first Southern writer to wax eloquent over a breakfast  spread, nor has he been the last. Since the days of plantations, breakfast has  been a major meal in the South -- for some, it is the major meal -- and in  almost every state from Virginia to Louisiana there remain many old and  established traditions surrounding the bountiful morning repast.  </P> <P> Today, many Americans get their morning start-ups from a cereal box or the  drive-up window of a fast-foot outlet -- if, indeed, they take the time to eat  at all. But on special occasions, whenever time permits, millions of people  linger nostalgically over breakfast the way it used to be.  </P> <P> For Southerners especially, the fondness for a substantial morning meal  endures. A hearty Southern breakfast in the traditional style has more than  enough diversity to draw an appreciative crowd to a boarding house or a banquet  table. It's a meal that is sometimes formal and sometimes casual; it knows no  bounds of class, race or calling.  </P> <P> Tennessee writer Wilma Dykeman in her 1966 novel, "The Farm Family," has Papa  explain the natural superiority of a good country breakfast to his children at  the table. "No Astor or Vanderbilt has better eating than this," he tells them.  "You young'uns just remember, the richest man living on Park Avenue in New York  City can't eat what we've got set before us right here this morning. His corn's  stale, his eggs have been shipped in from some place, his milk's all treated  some way -- I tell you, we're lucky folks!"  </P> <P> Never mind that most of the items on that once-standard menu -- bacon and  sausage, eggs and butter, milk and cream, coffee, hot breads, sweet syrups --  are now deemed poor choices from the standpoint of health and nutrition. To  enjoy judicious servings of them once in a while seems a pleasure too innocent  to abandon. That pleasure is what keeps the traditional breakfast close to so  many hearts.  </P> <P> Breakfast traditions have different origins in different regions of the South.  For example, the fabled Virginia hunt breakfasts that date back to the Colonial  era are restaged from time to time. Exceedingly popular Kentucky Derby brunches  are an outgrowth of the plantation banquets of old. In the South Carolina low  country around Charleston, morning feasts authentic in their fidelity to early  times can be found in cookbooks and even sampled in small cafes.  </P> <P> Spanish influences along the Gulf Coast from Tampa, Fla., to Mobile, Ala.,  still season the time-honored breakfast dishes of the subtropical terrain.  Nothing can top the richness and elegance of Creole cuisine in the forenoon  feasts that grace the brunch tables of New Orleans. Inland and upland across  the South, people of all classes still answer the call to country breakfasts  that easily make up in quantity and quality anything they may lack in the way  of elegance or formality.  </P> <P> As much as these delicious meals vary from one region to another, they are all  closely bound by the culinary traditions of the South. In every corner of the  region and in every season of the year, Southerners seem irresistibly drawn to  morning cookery.  </P> <P> It was Madame Elizabeth Begue of New Orleans who probably invented brunch. From  1863 until her death in 1906 she offered a sumptuous second breakfast in her  coffeehouse near the French Quarter marketplace. Among the dishes on her menu  were many Creole specialties that now are considered dinner items -- crawfish  bisque, for example, and jambalaya -- but some of her simplest creations still  rank among favorites for New Orleans breakfasts.  </P> <P> Madame Begue was a genius at using leftovers to make new dishes. In her  skillful hands, yesterday's potatoes and tomatoes found new life in today's  omelets, and she turned stale bread into pain perdu -- what we now call French  toast. Many of her recipes, published in the 1930s, have found their way into  other cuisines.  </P> <P> In the spirit of the German-born Madame Begue's second breakfast is another  French Quarter tradition known as Breakfast at Brennan's. Begun more than 40  years ago at a restaurant owned by Irishman Owen Brennan and his family, the  now-famous feast continues there under the direction of Brennan's sons.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, 800 miles upriver in Louisville, Kentuckians delight in their  elegant breakfasts on the day of the Kentucky Derby. Throughout the morning  prior to the running of the annual race, they work their way through icy mint  juleps, country ham, biscuits and gravy, grits and eggs, and other delicacies.  Like the hunt breakfast that preceded it, the Derby breakfast recalls the  lavish plantation hospitality of an earlier time.  </P> <P> Not all great Southern breakfasts are such elegant affairs. Consider, for  example, a straightforward combination of country sausage, gravy, fried eggs,  biscuits, fried apples and coffee. Their preparation is simple and the result  is an abiding pleasure for all who eat -- a table full of guests, a small  circle of family and friends or the cook, dining in peaceful solitude.  </P> <P> In "The Farm Family," Wilma Dykeman said it best. She wrote that by the time  Papa had finished his song of praise for his family's farm-fresh Southern  breakfast, "Ivy and the other children were sorry for millionaires who had only  money and could not enjoy the fruits of the earth at the peak of their season."  </P> <P> The following recipes were adapted from ones in "Mme. Begue's Recipes of Old  New Orleans Creole Cookery," (J. S. W. Harmanson, 1937); "Southern Food" by  John Egerton (Knopf, 1987), and from specialties at Brennan's restaurant in New  Orleans.  </P> <P> SMOKED SAUSAGE AND SAWMILL GRAVY  </P> <P> 12 ounces smoked sausage  </P> <P> Oil  </P> <P> 1/2 cup flour  </P> <P> 3 cups milk  </P> <P> Salt, pepper  </P> <P> Shape sausage into patties 1/2 inch thick.

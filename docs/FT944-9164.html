			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Survey of Derivatives (22): Forced on to the defensive - Profile of Bankers Trust Every risk, says the advertisement, deserves a second look. For Bankers Trust, author of the message, the line must have something of a hollow ring. This year, the New York-based bank has been forced on to the defensive in its risk management business - previously one of its fastest-growing and most profitable areas - by a string of accusations and lawsuits. Did its ambitious strategy in the derivatives business blind Bankers Trust to the risks it was running? One test will be the outcome of the lawsuits against it, in particular a Dollars 130m claim from Procter &amp; Gamble. The fall-out from that case has highlighted three areas of risk and raised questions about the bank's abilities to deal with them. These are: the risk posed by volatile financial markets, the risk to the bank's reputation when the complex financial products it deals in turn sour, and the risk that regulators will take action against the bank specifically and against the derivatives markets more generally. Market risk has surfaced in two forms for Bankers Trust this year - as a dampener on its own trading profits, and as a potential threat to the risk-management structures it devises for customers. In the first of these, it can draw comfort from its performance during turbulent world bond markets early this year. While the markets were awash with rumours of huge losses at Bankers Trust - forcing it to take the unusual step of issuing a denial - the first three months of the year brought a loss of only Dollars 49m from trading and proprietary position-taking, followed by profits in the following two quarters which were roughly in line with average quarterly earnings in 1991 and 1992. At a time when many other big traders were taking a bath, from hedge funds run by George Soros to the proprietary desks of banks such as Salomon, this counts as a creditable performance. For its client risk management business - which creates complex derivatives to reduce corporate or institutional customers' risks to movements in interest rates, currencies or commodities - the upheaval in financial markets could have a longer lasting impact. The complex interest rate swap created for Procter &amp; Gamble in November last year turned sour as US rates rose. Bankers Trust is believed to have suffered no market losses, since it has a policy of hedging its risks in such cases (according to Procter &amp; Gamble, the hedges used to cover the Dollars 200m swap had a nominal value of Dollars 3bn - an indication of the huge risks embedded in the instrument). But the swap left Procter &amp; Gamble committed to paying an interest rate of 14.12 per cent above the commercial paper rate for the next 4 1/2 years, rather than the 40 basis points below CP rate which had been its target funding rate. Whatever the merits of Procter &amp; Gamble's legal claim, it is clear that the product failed spectacularly. This highlights the second risk: to the bank's reputation. Arguably, its ambitions in the derivatives business, where it has a clear lead over most competitors, blinded it to the operational risks it was running. The preliminary results of an internal investigation, which has turned up apparent irregularities in bookkeeping and sales practices in its corporate derivatives business, suggest that internal controls failed (though it is far from clear yet whether this supports the legal claims of Procter &amp; Gamble and Gibson Greetings, which say they were misled about the nature of the financial instruments they bought). Meantime, in spite of the bad publicity it has attracted, Bankers Trust's earnings from the risk management business have held up this year. On average, income each quarter this year has matched or exceeded the experience of recent years - despite fall-off in position-taking by hedge fund and other so-called 'directional' traders. 'The biggest impact this year has been the fall in the market. It is holding back hedgers and view-takers at the same time,' says Brian Walsh, head of derivatives, Bankers Trust. Despite this, greater demand from corporate and institutional customers, including strong growth in the business in Europe, means that the bank continues to grow. 'Our risk management advisory teams are very busy,' says Charles Sanford, chairman of Bankers Trust. The third risk is still harder to quantify, but could have longer-term repercussions: that zealous regulators will make the derivatives markets a less profitable place to do business. The threat of derivatives regulation from Congress has died, at least for now. But both the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission are looking into the claims against Bankers Trust - the first clear sign that both agencies, feeling the heat from politicians, want to establish some jurisdiction over the over-the-counter swaps markets. If they are successful, the extra layers of regulation could add to the costs of derivatives activity. Some dealers complain that the SEC's capital adequacy rules would hamper the swaps market. These are risks for the future. In the meantime, Bankers Trust's results for 1994 so far have been remarkably steady - a testament to the success of diversification and risk management policies designed for just such eventualities. Even during the turbulent first quarter, the bank's return on equity reached 15 per cent. It stayed at that level in the following two quarters. A bigger challenge will be to lift profitability back to the levels which had put Bankers Trust among the top-performing US banks since the turn of the decade. Last year's return on equity of 26 per cent was the fourth consecutive year the bank had topped 20 per cent. Matching that will not be easy. Most analysts agree that 1993 was an exceptional year in financial markets that will not be repeated for some time. And even matching the absolute level of trading profits of earlier years will not produce a superior return on capital in the future, given the much higher levels of capital Bankers Trust now carries. At the beginning of 1990, the bank's total shareholders' funds were Dollars 3bn: by the end of September this year, the figure had jumped to Dollars 4.5bn. That may make Bankers Trust a better capitalised bank, but it leaves open the question of how it can grow its profits. The answer depends in part on whether Bankers Trust can employ its capital as profitably in future in the proprietary trading. 'We think that (it) will be a good business again,' says Mr Sanford. Has the amount of capital committed to the market by hedge funds and the proprietary desks of banks changed the character of markets, making it more difficult to identify 'directional' trends? 'No, I don't think so,' says Mr Sanford. 'There's just more volatility.'</p>

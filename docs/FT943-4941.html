			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: N Ireland peace hopes boost Dublin The FT-Actuaries World Index came out virtually unchanged last week but, across the world, there were some big individual market movements. Europe's best performer was Ireland, one of the smallest stock markets in Europe, and up by 4.5 per cent in local currency terms after a 3.5 per cent gain the week before. In its current EuroLetter, Morgan Stanley acknowledges that the announcement of an IRA ceasefire and the hopes for peace in Northern Ireland could only be good for the whole island. However, Mr Richard Davidson, the bank's European strategist, bases his argument for Ireland's equity market mainly on the transformation of Irish economic performance in recent years. 'We believe that the combination of an attractive valuation and a remarkable economic story, plus respectable profit growth, more than outweighs the historic investor worries about low liquidity and a restricted sector choice,' he maintains. Another smaller market, Finland, was Europe's next best performer, its 4.1 per cent gain taking it to a rise of 26.8 per cent for this year so far, against a 3.7 per cent fall for Europe, excluding the UK. Goldman Sachs believes that the Helsinki market remains attractive, and its analysts Mr Anders Bratenius and Mr Klas Andersson forecast a further 20 per cent gain over the next 12 months; they expect continuously strong earnings with a stronger Finnish Marka being the only material risk for earnings disappointments. They say the macro picture is improving in Finland. Positive factors include strong growth ahead as the effect of booming exports spreads into domestic activities, subdued inflation and scope for declining long-term interest rates. On the distaff side, they note a very high unemployment rate, and weak public finances. Europe's biggest fall of the week, 2.4 per cent, was in Spain. Ms Clare Miles at Kleinwort Benson notes that the Madrid market was making good progress in July and at the beginning of August, but that the Swedish and Italian official interest rate rises on July 10 left the outlook for further interest rate cuts in Spain looking precarious. Ms Miles advises a reduction in interest rate-sensitive stocks in Spain, and a switch into cyclicals. Mr Marcus Grubb, the Salomon Brothers strategist, says the broker's Spanish equity research team has reduced its year-end target for the Madrid General index from 365 to 325, a rise of only 5.8 per cent from last Friday's level, and that Salomon has reduced its weighting in Spanish equities in favour of German and Swiss shares. In the Pacific Basin, Hong Kong topped the ratings with a rise of 5.8 per cent on the week. Nomura's global strategy team of Mr Nicholas Knight and Ms Alison Southey have moved 4 per cent of their equity allocation out of Tokyo and into Hong Kong. They take the view that, in the US, long rates have not yet peaked and the dollar still has further to go on the downside. 'The Dow, moreover, should be pressured by concerns with regard to earnings and higher bond yields,' they say. In Europe, they reckon that the global interest rate environment will continue to put pressure on equities; and in Japan, that the stock market is vulnerable to a renewed burst of dollar weakness, and strength in the yen. 'Only South East Asia wins as far as we can see,' they declare, 'as concerns with regard to the upward march in US short-term rates ameliorate. The biggest winner from this is Hong Kong.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change  % change                      % change in local currency*  sterling*    in US                1 Week 4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of  Start of   Dollars                                             1994      1994  Start of                                                                 1994  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria         +1.41   +0.94    +5.75     -4.46     +0.99    +5.45 Belgium         +1.09   -0.87    +8.60     -3.21     +4.24    +8.85 Denmark         -0.13   -6.79    +2.48     -5.64     -0.41    +3.99 Finland         +4.11   +6.69   +45.65    +26.79    +39.38   +45.54 France          -1.44   -3.61    -3.97     -9.60     -4.45    -0.22 Germany         +1.99   +0.95   +11.69     -4.19     +6.40    +6.63 Ireland         +4.50   +3.20   +16.35     +6.80    +15.84   +16.08 Italy           -0.53   -2.97    +6.60    +11.77    +21.24   +21.49 Netherlands     +0.22   +0.46   +11.11     -1.38     +9.20    +9.42 Norway          -0.16   -1.66   +14.10     +5.34    +10.86   +15.76 Spain           -2.44   -6.18    -1.74     -8.59     -3.46    +0.80 Sweden          +1.26   +0.45   +15.76     +6.03    +15.26   +15.50 Switzerland     +2.86   +2.45    +9.82     -8.20     -0.45    +3.95 UK              -1.18   +1.67    +5.11     -5.11     -5.11    -0.92 EUROPE          -0.08   +0.07    +6.10     -4.29     -0.60    +3.80  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia       +1.21   +0.47    +8.22     -2.13     +6.85    +7.08 Hong Kong       +5.84   +3.76   +36.37    -17.36    -17.53   -17.36 Japan           +0.33   -0.46    -2.59    +12.85    +26.45   +26.71 Malaysia        +3.79   +6.58   +40.17     -9.40     -4.54    -4.34 New Zealand     +4.78   +4.32   +10.77     +2.95    +11.14   +11.37 Singapore       +1.91   +2.28   +19.44     -6.84     -0.26    -0.05  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada          +1.05   +4.58    +9.42     +3.09     -4.37    -0.14 USA             -0.58   +2.90    +1.94     +1.21     -3.07    +1.21 Mexico          -3.26   +3.08   +40.49     +2.76     -9.69    -5.70  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa    +0.76   +2.79   +52.26    +20.74     +9.38   +14.21  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX     +0.07   +1.18    +3.33     +2.28     +3.53    +8.11  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Based on September 2nd 1994.

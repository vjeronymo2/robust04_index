As the Hesse Environment Ministry  announced in the evening, there was no danger to the population,  as far as investigations can tell so far. According to the  operating company, RWE Energie AG (Essen), the fire was  extinguished quickly.    However, the Ministry has ordered all preparations for  restarting the Biblis A reactor to stop immediately, Spokeswoman  Renate Gunzenhauser said. The nuclear reactor had been closed  down for about three months because of maintenance work and was  supposed to be put into service again on Monday upon the order  of FRG Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer (Christian Democratic  Union). Hesse Environment Minister Joschka Fischer (Greens)  wanted to have the reactor closed down for the time being for  safety reasons.    Gunzenhauser said that the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory  Authority was informed about the accident by RWE Energie AG  early this evening. RWE reported that the fire alarm was  sounded around 1700. The internal sprinkler facility started  working around 1710, the fire was extinguished at approximately  1724. Employees of the Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Authority are  gathering information about the accident on site. The FRG  Environment Ministry has been told about the accident by the  Hesse Nuclear Supervisory Authority, Gunzenhauser stated.</p>

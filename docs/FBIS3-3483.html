Although we have returned  to the interior, our hearts still stay in Tibet. We never  forget Tibet and always pay attention to Tibet's construction  and development. To help Tibet develop the economy, we set up  an association of veteran fighters entering Tibet in an effort  to establish contact with people of all circles, including those  of commercial and industrial sectors at home and abroad and to  bring in specially trained personnel and technology into Tibet.    It is reported that veteran fighters who have worked in  Tibet  and now live in Chengdu, Tianjin, and Jinan also proposed  establishing associations of veteran fighters who had been in  Tibet to offer suggestions and plans for Tibet's economic  construction.

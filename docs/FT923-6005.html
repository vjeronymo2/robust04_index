			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Technology: Transgenic pigs head for market Transgenic pigs, bred for use in organ transplants, could prove profitable for the daring investor. British expertise and US finance have brought the futuristic scheme to the point of patent application. According to David White, a lecturer in transplantation immunology at Cambridge University, pigs hold the key to future organ supply. While transplantation skills race ahead, human supply lags behind, depriving thousands of patients each year of a lifesaving operation. Eric Rose, of Columbia Medical School in New York, has estimated that in the US a potential 20,000 heart transplant could be performed annually, yet fewer than 2,000 transplants are carried out each year. Discrepancies in supply and demand also exist in kidney, liver and pancreas transplantation. Anatomically and physiologically, pigs have many similarities to humans. They grow to a size comparable with even the biggest man. And since they frequently give birth to 12 or 13 piglets at a time, they can easily satisfy current demand. However, the big drawback between discordant species is immunological. The host rejects the organ graft within 10-15 minutes of transplantation. Every human has antibodies in the blood against every other distantly-related species, including the pig. In addition to natural antibodies, a further body defence system is activated, known as complement. 'Complement acts as the bomb of the immune system,' says White. Working with transplant pioneer Sir Roy Calne at Cambridge, White has used genetic manipulation to slow down the human complement response to the transplant. White has inserted into mouse cells a human gene - known as Decay Accelerating Factor (Daf) - which regulates complement activity. This protects the mouse from being destroyed by human complement. By transferring this technology to a clinically useful animal, White hopes to produce a transgenic pig. Its organs could be more successfully transplanted since rejection is less likely to occur. Once the graft is in place, animal models have demonstrated that it stands an increased chance of success. 'If you consider that in markets such as India where kidneys are bought and sold (the recipient pays more than Dollars 20,000 (Pounds 10,000) of which the middleman gets about Dollars 10,000 and the donor between Dollars 5,000-Dollars 7,000), this puts pigs into a very high-value bracket indeed,' says White. Some Dollars 1.5m has already been spent on White's research, with finance raised by the American concern Warburg Pincus. A patent is now pending for the transgenic technique developed at Cambridge. 'We're just beginning on the pig, but we have high hopes of success,' White said. In the US, transgenic pigs are already a reality. Since 1987, a Princeton, New Jersey company called DNX has been studying the potential of transgenic pigs as a source of universally compatible organs - specifically kidneys and hearts. Some 30 transgenic pigs have so far been produced by DNX, according to Paul Schmitt, president and chief executive officer. The pigs are able to produce human haemoglobin, for use in the race for universally compatible, easily-stored blood substitutes. However, John Logan, the company's vice president of research, believes that within 18 months the same patented technology will produce pigs whose organs will be transplanted into non-human primates. 'We don't want to mislead people at this stage,' Logan said. 'The days of using pig organs in human transplantation operations are way off - but I believe they will come.' DNX has currently raised Dollars 49m through a private placement and an initial public stock offering. Schmitt believes current market opportunities includes blood substitutes, drug testing and the donor organ market. 'Transgenic animal technology which is both technically innovative and cost-effective is the way forward,' he said.</p>

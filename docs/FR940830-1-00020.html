An applicant concern owned and controlled by an Indian tribe must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.112 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant concern owned and controlled by a Native Hawaiian Organization must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.113 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. An applicant concern owned and controlled by a Community Development Corporation must meet the requirements set forth in &sect;124.114 and in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109 as applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) An applicant concern's eligibility will be based on whether the concern meets each of SBA's eligibility criteria at the time the concern's completed application for admission to the 8(a) program is sent to the Office of MSB&amp;COD for processing or, in the case of a request for reconsideration, at the time the reconsideration application is deemed to be complete by SBA's Central Office. SBA, in its sole discretion, may, however, request clarification of information contained in the application or request for reconsideration at any time in the application process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) SBA will consider only additional information submitted by an applicant in response to an SBA request for clarification. Changes in an applicant concern that SBA becomes aware of between the date of application (or request for reconsideration) and the decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD that adversely affect the applicant's eligibility for 8(a) program participation will be considered and constitute grounds for decline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The decision of the AA/MSB&amp;COD to approve or decline an application for 8(a) program admission shall be based on whether the application, as clarified by any information submitted in response to a request by SBA, demonstrates that the applicant concern complies with each of SBA's eligibility criteria. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) All determinations made by the AA/MSB&amp;COD concerning the eligibility of an applicant concern for participation in the 8(a) program shall be in writing, setting forth the findings based on relevant facts and in accordance with applicable law and regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) An applicant concern which is declined 8(a) program admission may request a reconsideration of such decline, as set forth in &sect;124.206. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) If the application is declined on reconsideration based solely on a negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control, such decline may be appealed by an unsuccessful applicant to the SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) If no reconsideration is sought, or if after reconsideration the application is declined based in whole or in part on a ground other than a negative finding of social disadvantage, economic disadvantage, ownership or control, the written decline of the AA/MSB&amp;COD is final and not subject to appeal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) The procedures by which an applicant concern may appeal the AA/MSB&amp;COD's denial of 8(a) program admission to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, and the grounds for which such an appeal may be brought, are set forth in &sect;124.210 and part 134 of this title. Where such an appeal is brought, the written decision of the Office of Hearings and Appeals shall be the final Agency decision. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) A concern which has been declined for 8(a) program admission must wait at least 12 months from the date of the final Agency decision before it can reapply for program admission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) In order to continue its participation in the 8(a) program, a Program Participant must continue to meet all eligibility requirements described in &sect;&sect;124.102 through 124.109, &sect;124.111(a), and &sect;124.112, &sect;124.113 or &sect;124.114,  <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline --> if applicable. *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Section 124.102(a) would be revised to read as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.102 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Small business concern. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) In order to be approved for participation in the 8(a) program, an applicant concern must qualify as a small business concern as defined in part 121 of this title. The particular size standard to be applied will be based on the primary industry classification of the applicant concern. The size of a tribally-owned concern, a concern owned by a Native Hawaiian Organization, or a concern owned by a Community Development Corporation shall be additionally determined by reference to &sect;124.112, &sect;124.113 or &sect;124.114, respectively. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=37 g=1 f=1 --> * * * * * <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 13. Section 124.103 would be amended by revising the introductory text, redesignating current paragraphs (a) through (j) as paragraphs (b) through (k), respectively, adding a new paragraph (a), revising newly redesignated paragraph (g) and the first sentence of newly redesignated paragraph (i), adding a new sentence at the end of newly redesignated paragraph (j), and by adding new paragraphs (l) and (m) as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;124.103 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 -->  Ownership requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Except for concerns owned by Indian tribes, Alaska Native Corporations, Native Hawaiian Organizations, or Community Development Corporations, as defined in &sect;124.100, in order to be eligible to participate in the 8(a) program, an applicant concern must be at least 51 percent unconditionally owned by an individual(s) who is a citizen of the United States (specifically excluding permanent resident alien(s)) and who is determined by SBA to be socially and economically disadvantaged. Special ownership requirements for concerns owned by Indian tribes and Alaska Native Corporations are set forth in &sect;124.112.

			<p><P> May 29, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> TIME SPRINGS AGATHA CHRISTIE'S 'MOUSETRAP'  </P> <P> Next to "Twin Peaks," David Lynch's weird, funny and invigorating retooling of  the murder mystery, Agatha Christie's "The Mousetrap" would look like a house  cat standing alongside a drunken leopard with purple spots.  </P> <P> OK, maybe that's a little strong. And it's probably not fair comparing a play  that opened nearly four decades ago to a television series designed to kick off  the '90s. That doesn't change the fact, though, that to a contemporary  audience, "The Mousetrap" is likely to seem antique and predictable.  </P> <P> What about venerability? Can't "The Mousetrap," now at Westminster Community  Theatre, be enjoyed as a classic, an example of Christie's craftsmanship and  period-perfect plotting and characters?  </P> <P> Maybe, by Christie die-hards at least. But others probably will find it rather  quaint. Despite its popularity -- "The Mousetrap" remains the longest-running  drama in London, the touristy stage equivalent of Big Ben -- the whodunit isn't  even representative of Christie's best work. Stick with the novels for that.  </P> <P> The plot is as musty as the Gothic mansion in which it is set: While a  snowstorm gets nasty outside, a collage of peculiar people gathers at Monkswell  Manor for the night. Eyebrows raise, and sidelong looks abound. The radio  crackles with bad news about a deranged killer. He's among them, of course, and  he wants revenge. Bodies are soon to fall.  </P> <P> The play's best aspect is its eccentric characters, and director Jeanne Sanner  employs them as best she can. Pumping up their as-written oddness to comic  proportions, she has come up with a vaguely out-of-kilter, fairly amusing first  act that almost overcomes the play's deficiencies.  </P> <P> But "The Mousetrap" has thuddingly dull patches where nothing much happens, and  the time is filled by unrevealing talk and opaque red herrings. By the second  act, this whodunit is barely moving along. Even the sometimes sophisticated wit  of Christie's dialogue can't maintain the momentum.  </P> <P> The cast tries gamely. Jim Hannah's swishy fop of an architect, Christopher  Wren, is all fluttery mannerisms and shrieking syllables. Cliched, it  nonetheless succeeds in eliciting laughs. A more interesting character is the  cynical and shadowy Miss Casewell (Danielle Desmond).  </P> <P> The Ralstons, the young, somewhat blank-brained owners of the mansion, are  played with baffled good-humor by JoAnne K. Binkley and Michael O'Brien Jr. The  ominous Sgt. Trotter is given a decent reading by Eric F. Chandler, though he  does get a tad wiggy at the end.  </P> <P> 'THE MOUSETRAP'  </P> <P> A Westminster Community Theatre production of Agatha Christie's mystery.  Directed by Jeanne Sanner.

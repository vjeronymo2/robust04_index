			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong could face an exodus if things go badly  after China recovers the territory in 1997, and many people  would probably go to North America or Australia, a survey  published yesterday indicates.    The opinion poll by the Hong Kong Transitions Project, a  private academic research group, also found that Hong Kong  people wanting independence or to remain under British influence  outnumbered those wanting the territory to revert to China.    China has promised to keep Hong Kong autonomous for at least  50 years after 1997. But the poll, conducted early this year,  shows that many doubt that the territory could survive the  transition to Chinese sovereignty unscathed.    Forty-six percent of the respondents said they would try to  leave if Hong Kong changed for the worse after China took over,  and some 50 per cent had relatives abroad, mostly in the United  States, Canada and Australia.    "If events were to turn bad in Hong Kong after 1997, it is  likely that not only would millions seek to flee, other millions  abroad would open their arms to receive them," the poll report  said.    But the poll also found that the number who said they would  stay no matter what happened after 1997 climbed to 43 percent  from 38 percent in a similar poll a year ago.    More than 50 percent expressed concern over personal  freedoms  and politics after China takes over and 10 percent said they  were very worried, the poll said.    "Generally, those who are less worried are less educated,  women, older persons and those born in China," it said.    Forty-nine percent wanted Hong Kong to have independence,  remain British or become part of the Commonwealth.    But the number who support the Chinese takeover climbed to  44  percent from 26 percent questioned in 1991. Seven percent  didn't know.    The poll also said the Sino-British row over politics would  dampen voter turnout in the 1995 elections, Hong Kong's last  year under British rule.    The telephone poll of 636 people, conducted in January and  February, had a margin of error of four percent.</p>

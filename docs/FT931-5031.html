			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / MPs may probe Birt's tax affairs THE Commons Treasury Committee may question the Inland Revenue about the tax affairs of Mr John Birt, director-general of the BBC. Mr John Watts, the committee's Conservative chairman, yesterday called on the Revenue to have a 'very close look' into Mr Birt's tax position. His remarks followed the disclosure that Mr Birt was paid by the BBC via his private company, enabling him to pay less tax. Mr Birt has said he is giving up his freelance status and joining the BBC staff.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / Private View: One cool head in a crisis Trapeze guru Jean Palacy describes the pleasures of a life of flight THE CHANCELLOR performs a double backward somersault, currencies plunge through the safety net, the Big Top shudders, the president's prostate is paraded around the ring and the future of Europe hangs in the balance. It has been a spectacular week and its climax is tomorrow's French referendum. But here is one Frenchman who won't be voting. Jean Palacy is unmoved. 'I suppose it's my duty,' he said, 'because if the result's not good then I am responsible. Mais . . .' He shrugged. 'In any case I think politics is . . . I don't know how to explain . . . The outcome is always much the same.' The doyen of the flying trapeze has a longer perspective and larger preoccupations - not least the fate of his Ecole Trapeze Volant in Paris which next month will have to quit its present site because the developers are moving in. I found him, a broad-shouldered man hunched in a chair, giving master-classes in a leafy square in Bristol. His big hands worked the ropes of the safety harness while neophyte fliers swung to and fro, silhouetted in the rig above him before dropping exhausted into his net like ripe fruit into a basket. His English wife Pauline was on the platform shouting instructions: 'Shoulders up] Now bend] Keep your bum in]' After 27 years aloft as one of the most famous catchers in the world, the Professor of Trapeze, now 62, is grounded. One leg is twisted and he walks with a stick. He resembles an amiable troll with his big chest and strong arms, tanned face and gentle eyes. I asked him to describe the fascination of his trade. 'It's like flying, like being a bird. That sensation of flying then falling gently into the net is very pleasant.' When you're up there, what do you think about? The danger? 'No. One thinks about the job one has to do. To be a good trapeze artist you must above all think hard. It's not suppleness, or strength so much as mental lucidity.' But there is the element of danger, too. 'There is a bit, but not much on the trapeze. It's much more dangerous to go riding because if the horse shies you can fall on your head. When you know how to do it you can take off the safety harness and you have the net. There's no danger.' But you know people who've been killed doing it? 'Yes. Lots have. But not always because of the act - because of the gear.' Palacy's only serious accident occurred in the Christmas of 1950 when he was 20 and working with his first flying troupe, the Meteors, for Bertram Mills' circus at Olympia in London. 'It was the first day and the net was 25 metres off the ground. When the act was over I went like this (he spread his arms wide) to fall into the net. I went right through the net and fell 25 metres to the ground. I was six months in hospital in London, the West London in Hammersmith.' He smiled. The broken leg was re-set but he has been plagued with osteoarthritis ever since and will have to be operated on again soon. After a year's recuperation the widow of another catcher, Stephan Clerans, asked him to reform her husband's troupe. Clerans had plunged 18 metres to his death in Chicago when the rope he was descending after the act just snapped. Palacy, whose real name is Quentin ('Palacy' is an abbreviation of Pauline Lacy, the name of his second wife) was born in Paris, the son of a plumber and roofer - trades the son has himself pursued when down on his luck. It was seeing Tarzan in the cinema that decided his life for him. 'I wanted to play Tarzan and I did it. There was a place in Paris where they had trapezes, large and small, and you could go in and spend all day there for 50 centimes. There was no safety harness, no teachers. You did it by yourself. Sometimes trapezistes looked in and gave you tips. 'After four or five years you got to learn something. Then I was asked to join a troupe. I never thought of doing anything else.' What did your parents say? 'They didn't say anything. They were quite happy.' Is it a vocation, then, like the priesthood? 'Perhaps. For example at the school I train some doctors. Every year I have ten or 12 of them who train two times a week for three months. Then they put on a show for a week to raise money for humanitarian causes. And now I have some doctors who are no longer doctors. They've given up: they're trapeze artists. Its unbelievable.' So it's a sort of illness, then? 'Yes, it's like a drug. Once you've done it, you have to go on doing it.' Another of Palacy's former pupils was a dentist specialising in false teeth. At the age of 40 he decided to give it all up and teach trapeze: his school, which bears Palacy's name, is in Brussels. The two schools organise troupes to appear in festivals. 'They nearly always win gold and silver medals. After that, they want to work in big circuses. Everyone wants to be a flyer. But if you are big, if you are strong you have to be a catcher. Not many want to be the catcher because people aren't looking at him: they're looking at the flyer. But it's very important and much more difficult to do, and it takes longer to learn.' I asked Palacy whether the trapeze changed people and his wife answered for him in English: 'I don't think anyone could tell you. You have to go up there and feel it yourself.' I mean, does it change people's character? Jean replied: 'Yes. Very much so with children. It gives them much more self-confidence, much more balance. Schoolteachers have told me that they have pupils who are not good at school but after doing trapeze they start doing well at their books. The trapeze is very special, even in the circus.' The film director Carol Reed captured it in his 1956 film Trapeze, a flying love-triangle composed of Burt Lancaster, Gina Lollobrigida and Tony Curtis. The point of suspense, I seem to remember, involved an attempted triple somersault: would the jealous catcher (Lancaster) drop his young rival, or the beautiful girl, to their deaths? Lancaster had himself once worked as a circus acrobat but in the film it was Jean Palacy, then Jean Quentin, who doubled for him on the bar. I mentioned the triple and the professor said: 'Now they do four. When I was in the US to prepare a troupe for the Big Apple Circus, they took me to see the Ringling show and there the Vazquez did four and a half. I've heard, but not seen, that there's a Russian who does five.' Jean Quentin was married first, at the age of 19, to Josianne his flying partner and they had a son, Patric, who works as a decorator. The marriage broke up and Jean met Pauline, a dancer who was performing aerial routines with a troupe of acrobats, in Spain. They formed a famous double act. Married in 1972, they had left it too late to have children of their own so adopted a little girl of three, Josie, who has grown up to be a model and beauty queen. I wondered whether so single-minded and strange a career left room for other interests. 'Oh, yes', said Palacy, 'there are plenty of things. Music, for example. I listen a lot to South American music. I like to do odd jobs.' (Bricoler was the word he used.) Then he pointed to the silver rig above. 'I made all the gear, all the trapezes myself. 'Space travel interests me; people floating in space, free-fall parachuting, those sorts of things. I dont' read much. I do a lot of cross-words. When I do read it's Frederic Dard's 'Saint Antonio'. He's a comic crimewriter - il est tres drole. 'I knit as well. I make very nice pullovers. Anything to do with the hands I like.' He shouted to Pauline to fetch one of his sweaters from the van. She came back with a garment of purple, grey and white stitches; it looked very professional. 'I make them for my pupils. When I was in hospital I made jumpers for the nurses.' He laughed. You've devoted your whole life to this business. Don't you sometimes think you should have done something else? 'No, I don't think so. If I had to start again I'd do the same. But I'd do it better this time - quicker and better.' I left Jean Palacy in his caravan, wondering whether some of our leaders might not profit from a few lessons with Europe's leading aerobatics professor.</p>

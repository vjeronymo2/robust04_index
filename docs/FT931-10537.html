			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / 'Yobs' blow loud Euro-raspberry at Major YOUNG Conservatives yesterday looked to the mainland of Europe from the seaside resort of Southend and, to the embarrassment of their elders, blew an enormous raspberry at Mr John Major's policy on Europe. By a large majority of hands and even more foot-stomping, they rejected a motion that reflected the prime minister's policy. It said Britain's best interests would be served 'by playing an active role in the development of the European Community'. Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister and YC life patron, was booed and hissed, and his likening of young Euro-rebels to yobs was turned back on him. 'If I'm a football hooligan then at least when I go to the Continent I fight for Britain,' said Mr Matthew Palmer of London Young Conservatives. The young Tories, after a few years' good behaviour for the general election, were back on form. 'It is a peculiar culture,' said one cabinet minister, leaving the conference after making his speech. Most of the big-name speakers stayed little more than a few hours; Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, left soon after lunch on Saturday. In the late 1980s the battles were between Heathite 'wets' and Thatcherite 'drys'. Now, reduced in numbers, they refight the 1990 Tory leadership battle. Baroness Thatcher is cheered on every mention, Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary who brought her down, is jeered. Perhaps to his embarrassment, Mr Peter Lilley, the rightwing social security secretary, received the best reception. Part of his speech was on economic policy since Black Wednesday. He got only as far as 'since we left the ERM . . . ' before the cheering started. If he wanted to smile, Mr Lilley hid his emotions beautifully. The Europe debate saw copies of the Maastricht treaty torn up, and government loyalists shouted down. 'Maastricht is a good deal for Britain and we should jump at the chance to ratify it,' began one speaker to shouts of 'lies'. 'Only joking,' he added quickly. The hunched figure of Sir Teddy Taylor, local MP and leading Euro-sceptic, sat at the front. Afterwards he quoted 'that rather strange singer' Bob Marley, urging his young friends to 'stand up for your rights and keep fighting'. The conference slogan, 'Young Conservatives, the next generation', adapted the sub-title of Star Trek's new series. Mr Major may sometimes wish he can beam them into space.</p>

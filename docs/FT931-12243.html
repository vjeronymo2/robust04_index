			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cut likely in international rubber pact support price A MEETING of the international natural rubber organisation here today seems likely to agree on a cut in the group's buffer stock reference price despite a recent upward swing in the market. The reference price, which takes into account production and market conditions, determines when Inro's buffer stock manager should buy or sell rubber as part of efforts to stabilise prices. Inro rules stipulate that the reference price must be cut by 5 per cent if the average Inro daily market indicator price over the previous six months is below the 'may buy' level - at present set at Malaysian cents 176 a kilogram. Prices of natural rubber have risen in recent weeks because of a rise in world demand and the start of the wintering, the low production season, in many parts of south-east Asia, the world's main rubber producing region. But the Inro six month average is still just below the 'may buy' mark and traders say the market has already discounted for a cut in the reference price. Inro stockpiles of rubber now stand at about 160,000 tonnes.</p>

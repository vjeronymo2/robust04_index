The U.S. official made the statement while meeting with  visiting Chinese Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Liu Huaqiu.    Progress has been made in U.S.-China relations since the  Seattle meeting between the presidents of the two countries in  November, 1993, Christopher said, adding that since then there  have been other contacts and consultations at various levels.    This is good for enhancing mutual understanding, overcoming  differences between the two sides, and further improving and  developing relations between the two countries, he said.    The U.S. is committed to developing important ties with  China, and is willing to join the Chinese side to enable  relations to develop healthfully, Christopher said.    The U.S. official also expressed his admiration for the fact  that the 1.2 billion Chinese people have benefited from rapid  economic growth in recent years which have seen great changes  taking place in China.    In reply, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu said that  on the whole, the two countries' common interests and common  ground outstrip their differences, and this is especially so if  viewed in the long term.    He said China and the United States will eventually find  more  converging points of common interest and further relations  between the two countries provided both sides show great  foresight and look to the 21st century and the whole world, and  strictly abide by principles set forth in the three joint  communiques with a positive and serious attitude, respect  reality and increase consultations.    Liu arrived here Tuesday [25 January] at the invitation of  the State Department for political consultations at the  vice-foreign-ministerial level, according to an agreement  reached in Paris between the foreign ministers of the two  countries.    Liu had three rounds of consultations with Deputy  Secretaries  of State Peter Tarnoff and Lynn Davis, respectively, on  Wednesday and Thursday.    The two sides had a wide-ranging exchange of views on  bilateral relations, human rights, non-proliferation of weapons,  trade, and regional and international issues. The two sides  found they shared same or similar views on some of these issues,  though differences remain on others.    Both sides agreed to continue consultations on an equal  footing for appropriate, just and reasonable solutions to their  differences with an attitude of mutual respect and looking to  the future.    On Thursday, Liu also met with Deputy Defense Secretary  William Perry at the Pentagon. He also met with former U.S.  National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and former U.S.  Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger.    Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Li Daoyu was also present at  the meetings and consultations.</p>

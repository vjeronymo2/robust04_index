			<p><P> November 1, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SUSPENDED OFFICER SAYS POLICE USED SITTER AS SPY  </P> <P> A suspended Los Angeles police officer claimed Tuesday in court that the Police  Department violated her rights when it used her former baby-sitter to secretly  search her West Hills home during an investigation of the officer's alleged  sexual misconduct with a 17-year-old student.  </P> <P> Kathleen Oborn, 33, a four-year veteran who has been on suspension without pay  for nearly two years, is suing the Police Department and her former  baby-sitter, Allyson Di Conti, 23, for $10 million, charging that her rights  against unlawful search and seizure were violated.  </P> <P> During his opening argument in U. S. District Court, Oborn's lawyer, Stephen  Yagman, said the police Internal Affairs Division used Di Conti as its "agent"  during their March, 1987, investigation of allegations that Oborn had sexual  relations with a German youth who had stayed in her  </P> <P> home a year earlier as a foreign-exchange student.  </P> <P> Oborn, an unmarried mother of four who was assigned to a Parker Center vice  unit at the time of the investigation, married the student, Andre Rossky, when  he was 19 years old, Yagman said. Oborn has denied having a sexual relationship  with Rossky while he was a juvenile.  </P> <P> Yagman said evidence in the case proves that Di Conti acted under "color of  law," or as a police officer, when she helped gather evidence against Oborn. He  told the six-member jury that Di Conti wore a secret recording device and took  letters, a cassette tape and other property belonging to Oborn during a March  27, 1987, visit to Oborn's Blythe Street home.  </P> <P> "Allyson Di Conti was working as an agent of the Internal Affairs Division,"  Yagman said. "They were conducting a covert operation" and illegally searched  the home.  </P> <P> However, Di Conti's attorney, Shirley Warren, said Di Conti was a civilian  informant who volunteered to help the police because she believed the  relationship between Oborn and Rossky was emotionally harmful to Oborn's  children. Warren said Di Conti was invited into the home on March 27, 1987, and  took Oborn's property even though Internal Affairs officers told her not to  take anything.  </P> <P> Di Conti, the trial's first witness, testified she contacted police after she  saw Oborn and Rossky engaged in a sexual act in a friend's garage. She said she  later agreed to wear a recording device, but officers told her not to take any  property from the house.  </P> <P> "I was told . . . to get her to talk," Di Conti said. "I wasn't told to take  anything out of the house."  </P> <P> The trial before U. S. District Judge Jesse W. Curtis Jr. is scheduled to  continue today.  </P></p>

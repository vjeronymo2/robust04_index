			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / International Company News: Marriott board agrees plan to split company MARRIOTT Corporation, the hotels and food services company, reported flat third-quarter earnings and said that its board had voted to go ahead with its planned demerger on October 8. After a year of battling with angry bondholder groups, the company is splitting into two. Its main operating interests - lodging and food services operations, accounting for about 80 per cent of the unified company's revenues - will be known as Marriott International. Its property assets and its Host/Travel Plazas business, as well as the bulk of the group's debts, will be known as Host Marriott. Marriott International, the company whose shares will be distributed to Marriott Corporation shareholders in the form of a special dividend, will report its third-quarter results in mid-October. For the three months to September 10, Marriott had net income of Dollars 27m, or 21 cents a share, on sales of Dollars 2.03bn compared with net income of Dollars 26m, or 21 cents, on sales of Dollars 1.95bn a year earlier. Operating profit before corporate expenses and interest rose to Dollars 134m in the quarter from Dollars 124m a year earlier. Stripping out income tax adjustments and lodging dispositions in both years, Marriott said operating profits rose 7 per in the latest quarter on a comparable basis, while net income was 20 per cent higher. Lodging operations turned in an 11 per cent improvement in third-quarter operating profits including profits from the disposition of an equity interest in an international hotel. Sales were up 3 per cent. The Host/Travel Plazas division, which will be part of the Host Marriott company, reported higher sales in the quarter but operating profits declined.</p>

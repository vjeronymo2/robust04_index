			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by GATT Director General Peter Sutherland: "Spirit </F> of New Trade Order"]    [Text] I doubt there were many FINANCIAL TIMES readers who  failed to heave a hearty sigh of relief in April when ministers  signed the Uruguay Round deal in Marrakesh. Relief, partly  because most of them must have felt war-weary after eight years  of reading about seemingly interminable negotiations and partly  -- perhaps predominantly -- because they understood just how  vital the deal really was.    The results of those negotiations will be implemented as  from  January 1995 when the World Trade Organisation [WTO] comes into  being. One can only hope that the major players will not make  the process of ratification -- which is required before we can  finally confirm the implementation date -- into an agony of  indecision and delay. The birth of the WTO should not be held  hostage to domestic political in-fighting nor to transient trade  squabbles, which tend to be of mind withering inconsequence when  measured against the crucial importance of the new multilateral  trading system.    But even when the WTO is in place there will be a  temptation,  in some capitals at least, to revert to "business as usual";  perpetuating the same kind of preoccupations, justified or not,  with respect to bilateral trade balances alleged "unfairness" in  trading practices and so on. It is important that we recognise  that the WTO is a response to continuing global changes,  economic and otherwise, and that, as a consequence, its  activities have to be seen against a background of much more  than big power trade politics.    It will be a truly multilateral institution seeking  multilateral responses to the economic problems faced by a large  continuum of countries. This is not to talk of "world  government"; it is simply to face up to the inter-linkages  between economies. It is also to reassert the spirit of the  Uruguay Round in finding meaningful, practicable approaches,  acceptable to all, which drive forward the creation of wealth  and sustainable development.    Establishment of the WTO does, though, call for a new  commitment to co-ordination in economic policymaking. Why?  Think for a moment about one key preoccupation of most  governments at present: education and training in the context of  unemployment.    There is a convincing argument that expanded trade between  the developed and developing worlds has, in the past few decades  and particularly since the mid-1980s, led to significant  employment shifts in both. And it is not a simple matter of  jobs lost and gained. While the extent of jobs lost in certain  industries and gained in others in the developed countries can  be debated, it seems clear that trade with the developing  countries has tended to favour the skilled against the unskilled  and exacerbated the gap between them. At the same time, in  developing countries, export-oriented policies have encouraged a  faster rate of learning and investment in education. This has  opened up a gap between those with little or no education, who  are unlikely to be involved in anything but the most rudimentary  manufacturing activity, and those with at least a basic level of  education.    This is an important observation. The results of the Uruguay  Round, and particularly those related to increased market access  for goods and services, are designed to expand trade; certainly  between developed and developing countries and those countries  in the process of economic reform. Thus the impact of recent  trade growth on skill demands and on the gap between skilled and  unskilled, educated and uneducated may be reinforced and,  perhaps, accelerated over several decades.    Nor is it just concessions on market access which will spur  demands on education and training. New opportunities will be  opened up through the intellectual property agreement --  encouraging technology transfer, for instance -- and the  services deal will lead to the establishment of foreign service  providers requiring skilled, educated employees. And this  should not be seen as a one-way process; opportunities for the  development of new skills will be as great in industrialised as  in developing countries.    The real question that arises is whether we are thinking  hard  enough about the machinery which will help governments identify  and respond to such trends.    After all, it is evident that the most important influences  on national economies are now, and will be increasingly, outside  their borders. As a consequence, most governments will be left  with few policy instruments with which to attempt to affect the  performance of their own economies. If that is the case then it  is vital that the international machinery be effective.    I have argued previously that the present machinery of the  G7  is now inadequate. On almost every measure, it is an  unrepresentative organism and, consequently, its deliberations  seldom have meaning or relevance for countries outside the  select group -- not always, indeed, for those inside. That is a  big loss. The fact is that the G7 countries must recognise that  they cannot take sole responsibility for the broad thrust of  economic management without adequate participation of the  countries representing new dynamic markets in the developing  world. There is a need for a grouping of countries that can be  more effective and representative with some participation,  perhaps, on a rotating basis.    But the key to making such a group effective is not only  representation but the input participants receive. Here, the  multilateral institutions must now get their act together.    At present we have a multitude of researchers and analysts  in  a multitude of organisations producing countless papers and  reports to be added to those produced by governments themselves.  Why should the organisations concerned with money, finance and  trade -- the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the  WTO -- not evolve a single coherent statement on issues of  economic concern to a representative forum of the world's  leaders? And in order to ensure implementation of the decisions  reached, the same organisations should co-ordinate more  effectively to give strong institutional support.    One thing is for sure. We must concentrate on the long-term  implications of the agreements which have been reached and must  be implemented by the WTO and on the way in which this new  multilateral trading system will spur new approaches to global  economic management.</p>

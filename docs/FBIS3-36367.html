According to  Aliyev, last year formations of the Abkhaz and "confederate"  forces were mightily armed thanks to captured Georgian armored  vehicles and heavy artillery. Last year, Captain 1st Rank  Aliyev said, we had the military and moral potential enough to  advance through half of Georgia and to reach Kutaisi.    The South Ossetian parliament asked the Russian Federation  Council not to ratify the agreement until the Georgian-South  Ossetian conflict is resolved.</p>

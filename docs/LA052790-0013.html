			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS;  </P> <P> *** ART FARMER/ FRANK MORGAN/ LOU LEVY/ ERIC VON ESSEN/ ALBERT "TOOTIE" HEATH  "CENTRAL AVENUE REUNION" CONTEMPORARY  </P> <P> Recorded live in the Bay Area a year ago, this quintet session harks back to  the halcyon days of the 1940s Central Avenue scene, when jazz could be heard in  countless clubs almost 'round the clock. Trumpeter Farmer and altoist Morgan  were bandstand-mates then and they both still embrace the be-bop style: Farmer  is a little more true and precise in his improvisations, whereas Morgan likes  to let his lines squiggle chaotically on occasion.  </P> <P> While the tunes are solid (e.g., Miles Davis' "Donna Lee," Gene de Paul-Don  Raye's "Star Eyes," Farmer's "Farmer's Market," Sonny Clark's "Blue Minor" and  "Cool Struttin' "), the group doesn't achieve a 'band' feel and the versions  never jell into a groove. Farmer's ballad style on "Embraceable You" is ever  eloquent and Levy gets his moments as the Bud Powell-based pianist he's long  been. ZAN STEWART  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'CIRCUIT RIDERS': GIVING AWAY RESEARCH MONEY IS AN ART  </P> <P> The Circuit Riders: Rockefeller Money and the Rise of Modern Science by Gerald  Jonas (W. W. Norton &amp; Co.; $22.95; 432 pages)  </P> <P> Research is inherently haphazard and unpredictable. No one knows for sure how  to guarantee discoveries -- much less important discoveries -- in science.  </P> <P> It's not just a matter of getting smart people, giving them research tools and  support and letting them pursue their interests. Sometimes that works and  sometimes it doesn't.  </P> <P> Nor should their efforts be highly structured and controlled. That, too, is  unlikely to bring success -- however one measures success. Some combination of  structure and freedom is required.  </P> <P> Good intentions and selflessness do not guarantee achievement. Louis Pasteur,  who was only trying to help the French wine industry solve a problem, did more  to benefit humanity than all of the Florence Nightingales put together.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Various Approaches Tried  </P> <P> During the last few centuries, a variety of approaches have been tried. In the  18th Century, the British government offered a prize of 20,000 pounds for the  development of a clock that could keep time at sea, making possible navigation  by the stars -- a prize that was won by John Harrison.  </P> <P> The prize approach is still in limited use for specific goals. For example, in  recent years, prizes spurred the development of human-powered airplanes.  </P> <P> The most important prize in science is open-ended. Nobel Prizes are awarded  after the fact, not for previously identified achievements but for work that is  recognized as important. There is no doubt that the Nobel Prize is a carrot  that drives many scientists and much science.  </P> <P> Since World War II, government support for research has been an indispensable  element in maintaining the scientific enterprise. But it was not always so.  Earlier in this century, private philanthropy accounted for the bulk of that  support, none more important than the hundreds of millions of dollars given to  scientists by the Rockefeller Foundation.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Easy Task  </P> <P> Gerald Jonas tells the history of that support with considerable clarity and  insight in "The Circuit Riders: Rockefeller Money and the Rise of Modern  Science." He demonstrates that giving away money is no easy task, and he also  demonstrates that John D. Rockefeller hired exceptionally talented people to  decide how to do it.  </P> <P> Still, they were faced with the problem that today confronts all benefactors of  science, including the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes  of Health: namely, how to give away money effectively.  </P> <P> Having decided that the goal is to benefit humanity by increasing knowledge in  science and medicine, how can that be achieved? How does one identify worthy  projects, and how does one identify the right people to undertake them?  Ideally, this should be done objectively, and the current process of peer  review is intended to do just that.  </P> <P> But research into the peer-review process has shown that scientists are as  human as anyone else and that objectivity is an unachievable goal.  </P> <P> The Rockefeller Foundation, and particular its longtime director, Warren  Weaver, made decisions on a much more personal basis, but with no less success.  In fact, Jonas argues that the foundation's enlightened philanthropy has done a  better job of supporting science than the government or corporation-sponsored  research.  </P> <P> The foundation played important roles in the discovery of penicillin, as well  as in the agricultural revolutions that have increased crop yields around the  world. Those achievements alone help make Jonas' case.  </P> <P> There have also been clinkers -- how could there not be? -- and Jonas describes  them too. But, overall, he is a stanch defender of the foundation against  various critics, and his argument is persuasive.  </P> <P> It is not clear, however, how this success story can be duplicated. The lesson  seems to be that if you get very good people to hand out the money, much can be  achieved. But that just pushes the inquiry one stage back. Rather than asking  how to find brilliant scientists, the question becomes how to find brilliant  administrators to hand out the money.  </P> <P> As in most other areas of human endeavor, if you put the right people in the  right jobs, you have a chance. But doing that remains an art, not a science.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Lia Nesfiye: "Entrance Exams for Admission to </F> Police Schools"]    [Text] Public Order Minister Stelios Papathemelis and  Deputy Minister Kostas Yitonas plan deep and substantial changes  in police schools to enable the police to meet the modern  challenges. They plan the introduction of proper criteria based  on merit for admission to police schools and for the advancement  of police officers in the Greek Police [EL-AS] with an objective  system of transfers, as well as the institutionalization of the  right to form trade unions.    The Ministry of Public Order has already drafted a law for  the radical restructuring of the police, the change of the  system for the admission to the police schools, and for police  trade unions.    More specifically, the minister and the deputy minister of  Public Order in their news conference yesterday presented the  following:     -  A draft bill has been prepared regarding the  admission into the police schools for officers and policemen,  and for officers of the fire service using the system of General  Examinations for the Higher [AEI] and Technical [TEI]  Educational Institutions. A draft law has already been prepared  which will regulate the transfers in EL-AS based on objective  criteria and more specifically based on a system of  "points."    -  The draft bill which has also been prepared regarding  trade unions is recognizing this right within the basic  framework of Law 1264 which applies to civil servants, but with  differences on matters which are not proper for the security  forces (such as the right to strike).    -  The working groups set up  by the police have drafted a plan for the restructuring of the  various services by creating multifunction precincts supplied  with modern equipment, telecommunications facilities,  computerization, and which will include in their personnel  security services, public order forces, traffic policemen, and  market price control police. In other words, all that is  necessary to provide the comprehensive policing of a given  area.    -  A special group of investigator-detectives is being formed  to deal systematically with difficult cases to combat organized  crime.    -  Also, a special group is being created in the police to  deal with emergencies such as street mobilizations, or the  illegal occupation of buildings which call for special handling.  This group for crisis handling, as Public Order Minister  Papathemelis called it, will be properly trained to deal with  difficult situations.    In greater detail, the draft law provides that the admission  to police schools will be done through general examinations,  using in the schools for officers the "subject groups"  pertaining to the higher educational institutions and in the  schools for policemen those pertaining to the technical  educational institutions. The officer school studies will be at  the university level and will cover eight semesters, while those  for policemen will cover five semesters in addition to one  semester of practical training.    At the same time, a school of national security is being  established, corresponding to the war colleges of the Ministry  of National Defense, and will deal with the postgraduate and  advanced training of higher level police officers.    The Public Order minister gave assurances that the bill will  be introduced [to the legislature] before Easter, adding that  already the bill has been sent to the other interested  ministries for their comments which the Public Order Ministry  will review.     -  Regarding transfers to other localities or  posts, the minister said that they will take place once a year  and will come into force in September to avoid causing family  problems to police personnel. The transfers will be determined  on the basis of "points" adjusted to the needs of the  service.    -  With regard to the trade unions, the minister said that  there will be a first level, a second level, and one third level  organization. In other words, the first level organizations will  join together in a federation as a second level, and a  confederation will be the highest trade union organization for  all police personnel. The ministry is engaged in a dialogue with  the trade unions and other agencies to resolve various issues.</p>

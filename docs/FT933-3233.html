			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / Battlelines are drawn: Public-sector workers will need increases of at least 3 per cent in 1994-95 merely to maintain their standards of living, say pay analysts 'We have to break the inflation psychology that in the past has led to expectations of pay increases every year unrelated to efficiency improvement or the ability of the employer to pay.' Kenneth Clarke, chancellor 'This could bring the country to the brink of another winter of discontent.' Jimmy Knapp, Rail Maritime and Transport Union general secretary 'When the government says these people can only get extra pay if productivity rises, what do they expect firefighters to do - go out and start fires so they can put them out?' Frank Dobson, Labour employment spokesman 'The government's double whammy of wage restraint and extra taxes should be met with firm resistance.' Chris Humphreys, Unison's senior London officer 'The fresh clampdown will increase the likelihood of a ballot being held after last-ditch pay talks with local authority employers next week.' Ken Cameron, Fire Brigades Union general secretary</p>

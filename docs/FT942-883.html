			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Emerging Markets: News round-up ECUADOR The biggest single trade ever crossed on the Quito stock exchange was executed last Wednesday when the Ecuadorean government sold its remaining stake in the cement company, La Cemento Nacional, writes Stephen Fidler. The stake - 20 per cent of the company - was bought by the London-based merchant bank Morgan Grenfell, and placed with investment institutions in the US, which took 70 per cent of the shares, and the UK. The shares were sold by the government at the prevailing market price - 215,000 shares were sold at 404,000 Ecuadorean sucres (Dollars 187) each, giving a value to the trade of about Dollars 40m. The shares had fallen from a peak of 580,000 last November, in part because of a dispute with the mayor of Guayaquil about tax payments. They rallied sharply afterwards. Bankers at Morgan Grenfell said they planned to create an unsponsored global depositary receipt programme for the shares, which should be in place in about two months. Recent excitement in emerging markets largely by-passed Ecuador, which has only moved ahead slowly with economic reform. That has meant that shares are cheaper than in other Latin stock markets. Morgan said La Cemento's prospective price-to-earnings multiple this year is about 9, compared, for example, with 17 for Colombia's Cementos Diamante, while the dividend yield is about 7.5 per cent. Until Wednesday, La Cemento, which sold 1.4m tonnes of cement in 1993 to generate Dollars 128m in revenues, had been a joint public/private company since 1974. Holderbank, the Swiss cement giant, took a 50 per cent stake in 1976, which it retains. La Cemento also has an 8.1 per cent stake in the Peruvian company, Cementos Norte Pacasmayo. OMAN The first fund to offer foreign access to a Gulf stock market will open for trading on the London and Muscat stock markets on Thursday. The Oryx fund, jointly managed by London-based Blakeney Management and the Oman National Insur-ance Company, raised Dollars 52m in an issue completed last week. As obliged by Omani law, 51 per cent of the fund's capital was raised in Oman, with the remainder coming from a 'comfortably oversubscribed' international issue, with most interest coming from the US, the UK, Switzerland and the east Asia. MAURITIUS Mauritius is to open its stock market to international investors following an announcement last week in the country's budget. Previously foreign investment in securities could be channelled only through the UK-based Mauritius Fund, which was started 18 months ago. Thirty-four securities are listed on the equity market, which saw a 290 per cent increase in turnover in 1993 as the market index surged by 119 per cent. Market capitalisation currently stands at Rs18.8bn (Dollars 1.1bn). BURMA More than 100 companies have invested over Dollars 1bn in Burma since the ruling junta began liberalising the economy in late-1988, said Brig Gen David Abel, minister for national planning and economic development. He added that Singapore was the major foreign investor, having invested some Dollars 500m. Emerging markets coverage appears daily on the World Stock Markets page</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "m.v.": "Facing Minister Andreatta's Anger"] </F>   [Excerpt] Rome -- Italia Uno television's "Open Studio"  news program is turning into an "open polemic" with Foreign  Minister Beniamino Andreatta. Replying to a question by a  female journalist from the network, who had pointed to Italy's  low foreign policy profile on Bosnia, Andreatta, yesterday  evening, hit back with a vitriolic response: "For days 'Open  Studio' has been criticizing us, while we are working in the  country's interests." Yesterday, on the 1400 [1300 GMT] news,  it was director Paolo Liguori's turn to counterattack: "After  days, weeks, instead of casting his anger at the persons  responsible for the massacre, he took it out on us who given  evidence of it. We had only mentioned that Italy also was doing  too little. Now Andreatta wants to cover the past. He is going  to Sarajevo, along with Prime Minister Ciampi and President  Scalfaro. Their presence, in these decisive times, can  dedramatize the situation and favor a solution."    Liguori then went on to denounce the contradiction that we  have recognized Bosnia as an independent sovereign state but do  not yet have an accredited an ambassador in Sarajevo, "and as a  result there is no Bosnian ambassador in Rome, with the result  that the Swiss ambassador has to go down to Bergamo to sign the  passports of Bosnian refugees in our country." It is also on  details, which are not minor , that "one has to judge a  country's commitment."    Andreatta, Liguori explained to us after the TV news  program,  "in fact provided a mumbled response on the question of  ambassadorial accreditation, maintaining that one had been  appointed, but had then resigned. A justification which is not  valid in international diplomacy." In fact the polemics go back  to the 10 days during which "Open Studio's" team was away in  Bosnia. "In Sarajevo," Liguori said, "when we brought President  Izetbegovic into the studio, we would have liked to have had him  hooked up with Andreatta in Milan or Rome. He, on the other  hand, did not turn up, and naturally we said so. Then we  discovered the case of the ambassador, and we disclosed that  too."    Liguori f state: "We have been to Sarajevo, now the ministry  is moving. It is important to break the Bosnians' isolation.  When French President Mitterrand arrived at Sarajevo, this led  to the opening of the airport, which since then has served for  humanitarian flights. A whole number of ministers and prime  ministers have gone to Sarajevo, French, English, Turkish. But  not us." Nor does the "Open Studio's" director like Andreatta's  approach toward the Serbs: "It is wrong to vilify a whole  people. But if the Serbs of Bosnia and Belgrade continue to arm  and to supply the Bosnian Serbs, they need to be held  accountable. And it seems to me, unfortunately, that Andreatta  is using a dangerous tone in his dealings with the Serbs. In  this war, neutrality is complicity. To indulge in semantics as  to who fired the grenade in the market is stupid, ridiculous and  hypocritical, when everyone knows who fired it." Conclusion:  "Andreatta, go to Sarajevo."

			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / Work experience western-style: Peter Norman reports on the Russian 'secondees' who are eager converts to capitalism THEIR resolve stiffened by an outward bound course in the Welsh mountains, the first of up to 1,000 young Russians will soon start working with British financial institutions under Mr Norman Lamont's scheme to spread practical knowledge of the market economy in the former Soviet Union. Last night the first pilot group of 20 'secondees' and their employers attended a reception in 11 Downing Street to mark the formal beginning of what has become known as the chancellor's Financial Sector Scheme. The idea, first put forward by Mr Lamont last October, is that banks, building societies, insurance companies, brokers, accountants and solicitors across Britain should provide jobs for financial services personnel from Russia and the other former Soviet republics for between six months and a year. On their return they will become an elite cadre that will help build the financial, legal and accounting infrastructure needed to modernise the former Soviet Union. 'A modern financial system is basic to the future of Russia,' Mr Lamont said. 'I think they need help there. By asking each company really to make a small sacrifice, just to pay somebody for a short period of time, it seemed to me that by harnessing private effort we really could achieve quite a lot.' Having met five of the Russians this week, it seemed more likely that the first group of employers - which range from NM Rothschild in the City to the Marsden Building Society in Nelson, Lancashire - will be gaining a valuable asset rather than making a 'small sacrifice' by employing the secondees. All were extremely keen to start work around the end of this month after completing an intensive course in business English and finance at Middlesex Polytechnic in Hendon. They also proved to be surprisingly knowledgeable, reflecting, in some cases, intensive study of capitalist ways in academic institutions under the communist regime. Mr Viatcheslav Butyrski, at 28 the head of securities trading at Promstroybank in Moscow, was looking forward to six months with Swiss Bank Corporation in London in which he would be able to relate his theoretical knowledge of share and bond trading to modern practice. He obtained a degree in capital market studies from the USSR Institute of Banking before joining the 70-year-old Promstroybank after it was converted into a joint stock bank a year ago. Ms Marina Krupina, 37, will be working in Cardiff with the Bank of Wales, where she hopes to learn how a medium-sized western bank operates. She says she has already gained some insight into western accountancy and taxation practices after working at Promstroybank for five years on joint ventures with foreign companies. Mr Igor Kostikov, 33, is already an entrepreneur in his own right as one of the owners and directors of Marka, a private sector financial consultancy and stockbrokerage. His varied career began with the study of Marxist political economy. But he claims that he has spent six years acquiring expertise about the British economy, including the privatisation of the oil and electricity supply industries. The main computer centre of the USSR Ministry of Finance may seem an odd apprenticeship for a stockmarket career. But Ms Elena Shakhurina, 26, is now a fervent advocate of equities and privatisation and looking forward to applying experience acquired with Nikko Europe when she returns to Moscow's International Stock Exchange in six months' time. Just a year ago Mr Max Diakonov, 22, graduated from Moscow's finance academy and joined the international department of Inkombank, one of the new Russian commercial banks, as head of correspondent banking. 'I have very good relations with western banks. But I don't have enough experience. That is why I am here. I will work in Lloyds Bank in London and Birmingham and try and find something really good for the Russian economy,' he says. 'I want to be an expert, the best in my sphere.' This first batch of secondees are impressive. But officials from the British Council, which is managing the scheme, point out that the first candidates 'self-selected' themselves, after hearing about the plan on the Moscow gossip circuit or having been tipped off by employers that were in close contact with the British Embassy or British Council in Moscow. They then had to go through a rigorous selection procedure, including a tough test in English. Sir Derek Thomas, European adviser to NM Rothschild, helped to interview the candidates. He has no doubt that Russia and the other republics will make the transition to the market economy if the pilot group is representative. So far about 300 UK companies have promised to take on a secondee. 'And if we can get 1,000 people, that actually is a very big thing,' Mr Lamont said. But the young Russians now in Britain are under no illusion that the hard work begins once they return home. As Mr Diakonov says: 'The main aim of the scheme is to help but not to solve our problems.'

			<p>940415 FT  15 APR 94 / Survey of Turkey (10): A meteor falls to earth - Anne Counsell on the stock market fall-out According to an Istanbul analyst, 'the PMT set off the market's decline and it was all downhill from then on.' He is not talking about hormones. 'Post Moody's Tension' on the Istanbul stock market resulted in an evaporation of confidence and the disappearance of funds. The acronym and the trading room banter belie the financial fall-out of recent months. The parlous state of Turkey's public finances was highlighted by Moody's rating agency in mid-January when it downgraded Turkey's long-term debt rating from BAA to BA1, considered a 'junk' rating. This was briskly followed by Standard &amp; Poor's which reduced its long-term foreign currency rating from BBB to BBB minus. The Istanbul Stock Exchange 60-share composite index ducked and dived with the ensuing upheavals on the foreign exchange market as Turks rushed to buy dollars and interbank overnight interest rates rose to 150 per cent. By early February the index had sunk 30 per cent from its high of 28,300 in early January. There was no respite - inflation figures turned sharply upwards and the second central bank governor in six months resigned. The stock market dropped a further 23 per cent to hover uneasily around the 13,000 level. Trading volumes all but collapsed as traders retreated to lick their wounds and await the outcome of municipal elections. Turnover plummeted to TL1 trillion (Dollars 56m) from an average of TL4 trillion in early January when the market was at its high. On the almost empty trading floor, boards are locked within half an hour as prices hit lower limits for the day - a far cry from the halcyon days of last year when traders streamed into the rundown stock market building near the dockside. Last year, Istanbul was a darling of the emerging markets, rising by a meteoric 194 per cent in dollar terms and outperformed only by Poland in the emerging markets league. In November, the high levels of foreign interest and recognition of the market's own regulatory system resulted in the Istanbul market joining the two dozen exchanges in the world granted the status of 'designated offshore securities market' by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Last year, everyone was buying on expectation, now they are selling on reality,' says Mr Ozkan Gokdemir, general manager of Carmen Investment. The shares of many companies have fallen below their book values. Erdemir, an iron and steel producer which last year invested Dollars 1.5bn in new plant and equipment, could be bought outright for Dollars 350m when its shares fell to their low of 15 cents. Mr Kosta Zamani, of the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private sector lending arm, is cautiously optimistic that the market will improve over the long term. However, he expects a prolonged recovery for the market due to the perilous economic conditions. 'The economy hasn't been mismanaged,' he says. 'It hasn't been managed at all.' The next few months, he believes, will be critical. Much will depend on whether the recent austerity package is sufficient, credible or can be implemented, especially the political difficult closure of several loss-making state enterprises. Mrs Ciller's track record on the economy has been less than glowing and the stop-start privatisation programme has left the market sceptical. In happier days, the stock exchange hoped that privatisation would boost the hungry market with new issues. Today brokers are doubtful that the programme will succeed, noting that more has been spent on studies than has been realised by sell-offs. In March, a report by the Istanbul-based Turkish Young Businessmen's Association said the success of privatisation would depend on political resolve, noting that 'officials approach privatisation as an independent issue rather than as part of an economic improvement plan'. By way of encouragement, the report pointed out that 'privatisation programmes had been implemented successfully even in countries with worse economic indicators than Turkey.' The consensus, however, is for a semblance of stability after the volatility of recent months. A few of the optimists hope that the economy will be on an even keel by the time the stock market moves to its expansive, new premises in the Istinye business district of Istanbul. Those with more bearish tendencies note that the move has already been delayed by six months, as has the change-over to a fully automated trading system.</p>

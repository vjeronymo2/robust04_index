			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAKERS TROUNCE SEATTLE;  </P> <P> GREEN SCORES 33 AS L.A. COLLECTS WIN NO. 50, 115-97  </P> <P> Between diagramming plays here Tuesday night in his new capacity as a Golden  State Warriors scout, former Portland Trail Blazer Coach Mike Schuler pointed  to Laker forward A.C. Green and shook his head seemingly in disbelief.  </P> <P> "He's gotten so much better, just this season, that it's really scary," Schuler  said.  </P> <P> Whether it was savagely pulling down rebounds, systematically swishing outside  shots, blocking shots like a volleyball spiker or scuffling with Xavier  McDaniel, Green was a dominating force in the Lakers' surprisingly dominating  115-97 victory over the Seattle SuperSonics before 14,819 at the Coliseum.  </P> <P> Not quite a one-man show, but the Lakers' most vital component on this night,  Green scored a career-high 33 points, making 11 of 14 shots, grabbed 10  rebounds and blocked three shots and did not back down during a shoving match  with the notoriously hot-headed McDaniel in a third-quarter altercation.  </P> <P> Green's performance, coupled with an 18-assist night from Magic Johnson and  help off the bench from previously untapped sources such as Mark McNamara and  Tony Campbell, enabled the Lakers to win for the first time in three meeting  with the SuperSonics in Seattle.  </P> <P> It also gave the Lakers their 10th straight 50-win season and, with 10  regular-season games remaining, kept alive their slim hopes of finishing with  the league's best record.  </P> <P> Laker Coach Pat Riley could not remember the last time his team played this  well on the road, which has been fraught with obstacles for the Lakers all  season. They made 55.7% of their shots, resurrecting their fast break by  holding a 53-35 rebounding advantage. And, defensively, the Lakers forced the  SuperSonics to shoot just 41%.  </P> <P> "It was a total effort tonight," Riley said. "Our defense was exceptional. It  had to be one of our better road games in quite some time."  </P> <P> Not coincidentally, it also was one of Green's better games in some time.  Perhaps the most consistent Laker, in terms of effort and rebounding, Green  showcased all facets of his game Tuesday night, perhaps surprising the  SuperSonics as well as courtside observers such as Schuler.  </P> <P> "A.C. scored 33 tonight?" Riley asked. "We don't even run any plays for him.  From a percentage standpoint, A.C. is right behind Byron Scott from long-range  shooting. Most teams still don't believe he can shoot out there, and they  sacrifice him to double-team other guys."  </P> <P> Five of Green's 11 baskets Tuesday night came from the perimeter, but he still  does his best work underneath. Green had four of is six offensive rebounds in  the second half, and his aggressive defensive play kept the SuperSonics from  scoring inside.  </P> <P> "Seattle is the kind of team that makes you play hard," Green said. "They  challenge you, and I like challenges. They are either going to run over you, or  make you play well. One or the other."  </P> <P> Green certainly did not allow himself to be run over. His clash with McDaniel  almost started the second Laker fight in as many games.  </P> <P> Just as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was restrained after shoving Milwaukee's Larry  Krystkowiak Sunday night, Green and McDaniel had to be pulled apart (by Riley,  of all people) after an exchange of shoves late in the third quarter of  Tuesday's game.  </P> <P> The incident happened with 1:36 to play in the third quarter. Seattle's Sedale  Threatt had found a gap in the Laker defense and was heading uncontested to the  basket for a layup. Then Green emerged to deny the basket with a hard foul.  </P> <P> Green stood over Threatt for a moment, apparently trying to step over him, when  McDaniel intervened. The two proceeded to scuffle, trying to disengage  themselves from peacemakers to begin again. They were near midcourt when Riley  risked his designer cut suit and went between the players, arms outstretched.  </P> <P> "I don't really know what happened," said Green, hesitant to talk about the  incident. He thought one thing; I thought another."  </P> <P> McDaniel was not available for comment.  </P> <P> Riley said he intervened because he did not want to lose Green, at a crucial  juncture of the game.  </P> <P> "A.C. is a warrior, and so is X (McDaniel)," Riley said. "The altercation got  heated, and neither team needs to get somebody suspended, especially at this  time of the year."  </P> <P> With 10 games left in the regular season, the Lakers are trying to get their  act together heading for the playoffs. Before Tuesday night, the Lakers had  been 0-7 against their three main Western Conference rivals -- Utah, Phoenix  and Seattle -- something that was mentioned before the game.  </P> <P> "Going into Utah and Phoenix this season and not winning, we felt we had to  break through," Riley said. "To show ourselves, not anyone else, that we can  win on the road."  </P> <P> The Lakers took control almost from the outset, holding a 54-51 halftime lead.  A 15-3 run early in the third quarter gave the Lakers a 14-point lead, which  was cushion enough to withstand a brief fourth-quarter challenge.  </P> <P> The closest the SuperSonics could come to catching the Lakers was 87-80 with  9:43 to play. Even when Riley gave Green and Johnson a two-minute rest shortly  thereafter, the Lakers maintained an 11-point lead.  </P> <P> When Johnson and Green returned for the final 6:21, the Lakers went on a 10-4  surge that clinched it.  </P> <P> Riley, who said the Lakers are basically just fine tuning for the playoffs,  apparently came upon a substitution pattern that works. Forward Orlando  Woolridge was benched Tuesday night, in favor of McNamara, whose forte is  rebounding and defense. And Campbell also took some of Woolridge's minutes to  help jump-start the Laker fastbreak.  </P> <P> For one night, at least, that combination was productive. McNamara had 10  points and six rebounds in 21 minutes, and Campbell had eight points in 13  minutes.  </P></p>

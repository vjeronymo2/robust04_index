			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ARENA's [Nationalist Republican Alliance] government  program for the 20 March elections offers to create appropriate  conditions for transforming El Salvador into a country of  opportunities and fairness; to consolidate democracy by making  individual rights the foundation; and to uphold the principles  of a free, just, and united society. The action plan is  presented in four functional areas:  <H5>  Political Area </H5>   Within the framework of a new culture of peace and  democracy,  ARENA proposes to coordinate legislative actions, strengthen the  judiciary, modernize the public sector, and ensure municipal  development. The party proposes to coordinate education programs  for peace and democracy through the Ministry of Education in  coordination with the judicial branch, the Office of the Human  Rights Ombudsman, and other offices, as well as guaranteeing the  development of freedom in all its manifestations.    ARENA offers to promote the independence of municipal  governments so they can participate in the development of their  communities. It proposes to support the advancement of the  Legislative Assembly's technical and administrative capabilities  so it can respond to a free society.    ARENA suggests a foreign policy that will protect the  country's interests and the welfare of all Salvadorans living  abroad; a foreign policy that will be analogous to Central  American integration.    The public official morality bill would be modified and the  state administrative financial systems would be modernized to  prevent illegal enrichment and the abuse of power at all levels  and all institutions of the public sector.  <H5>  State of Law and Public Safety </H5>   ARENA offers to continue improving the entire legal system,  especially by reviewing the entire legal process and modernizing  the judicial branch, the justice ministry, and other agencies  involved. It would create effective instruments to prevent and  fight crime and upgrade scientific investigation systems in  connection with respecting human dignity as consecrated in the  Constitution of the Republic.    It offers to consolidate the police modernization process to  guarantee citizen security; proclaim citizen rights and duties,  including applicable laws; and guarantee the right to property,  administration of justice, and citizen security.  <H5>  Economic Development </H5>   ARENA intends to modernize government institutions to  guarantee greater efficiency and responsibility; centralize  public administration to do away with bureaucracy; privatize  government organizations that should not be managed by  government; and maintain a monetary and fiscal discipline to  ensure proper public spending.    It offers to strengthen the financial system to protect the  people's savings and guarantee the system's efficient  operations; to increase public investments with an emphasis on  personnel training; and to protect consumers by guaranteeing the  quality, weight, and measure of products and by implementing  supervision mechanisms.    The party proposes to gradually reduce tariff and nontariff  barriers and promote agricultural and industrial conversions to  increase competitiveness and exports.  <H5>  Social Development </H5>   ARENA intends to modernize social programs in the health,  education, and housing sectors by decentralizing them and  training communities and beneficiaries to participate in their  implementation. It will reinforce programs that promote equal  opportunities by training personnel in the informal sector, the  micro and small business sectors, and the peasant sector.    The party will suggest social programs to attack the causes  of poverty at its roots and increase workers productivity with  new technology and opportunities. It plans to change municipal  governments so they can identify problems, implement solutions,  and assign resources. It also suggests that nongovernmental  organizations and the private sector carry out development  programs in the communities.    The health and education budgets will be strengthened.  Income  will be redistributed to focus on those sectors and direct  subsidies will be assigned. Property ownership will be  facilitated by simplifying procedures and giving credit in a  timely manner.    ARENA offers to modernize the social security system by  improving its quality and coverage. It proposes an environmental  strategy and policies to ensure that land be used properly and  according to its properties. It offers to strengthen the micro  and small business sectors so they increase in number, improve  in competitiveness, and boost participation in the market. Youth  programs will be created to combat drug addiction and crime.    ARENA offers to implement this government program based on  the following actions: subsidies, decentralization,  participation, solidarity, progress, and specific actions.</p>

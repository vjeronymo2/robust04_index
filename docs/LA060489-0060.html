			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SPEAKING OUT: A BOND WITH THOSE WHO COME AFTER US  </P> <P> When we first moved into our turn-of-the-century house -- my first house,  actually -- and started the endless process of getting it into shape, it was  discouraging to discover that while the original structure was remarkably solid  and well-built, most of what had been changed or added over the years had been  done poorly.  </P> <P> Bad plumbing, shoddy electrical work and careless carpentry greeted us at every  turn. In most instances cheap materials had been used, and fixtures improperly  installed.  </P> <P> I remember the day that water started flowing from the kitchen ceiling. We  weren't certain which fixture upstairs was responsible until one day a guest  took a fragrant-pine bath.  </P> <P> As I watched the green water dripping into a bowl on my kitchen counter, and  smelled the pine mingling with the garlic and herbs in my potage as it simmered  on the stove, I wondered what sort of horror we were about to uncover. How  could the bathtub be draining into the kitchen?  </P> <P> The explanation was quite simple: the trap had been improperly located under  the tub. It had rotted out and needed to be replaced. But to reach it, half the  bathroom and a chunk of the kitchen ceiling had to be torn out.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Why Did They Skimp?  </P> <P> We decided that we might as well have the entire bathroom remodeled. As we  began to plan for this work, we again asked ourselves the question we had  already asked so often:  </P> <P> Why wasn't the effort made to do the job properly at the beginning?  </P> <P> One probable answer was that doing the job right would have required additional  outlays of time and money. And if the quality of the work in the house had been  adequate for the lifetime of the people who had done the work, why should they  have bothered with additional time and cost?  </P> <P> As we gradually transformed our home over 10 years, the question of how the  work should be done arose over and over. Each time we had to make a decision,  we faced the same issue:  </P> <P> How far beyond our own life span -- or house span -- should we be thinking?  </P> <P> It would have been easier not to think about what we would be leaving behind  for the people coming after us. But our own frustration at what we were finding  made us determined to do everything the best way we could and to spend some  extra money, if need be, to give our unknown friends-of-the-future something of  value to work with, and work in.  </P> <P> We also took stock of our landscaping attitudes.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Slow-Growing Trees  </P> <P> I had wanted to plant fast-growing trees and shrubs, although I knew that the  faster they grow, the shorter their life span. I was thinking only of myself.  They certainly would have lasted long enough to give me pleasure.  </P> <P> It took some reassessing of my own values before I saw the importance of  planting slow-growing trees. Now I love the idea. And when I walk around my  suburban neighborhood, I think often of my debt to those who, long ago, planted  the majestic, slow-growing trees whose branches are like arms of friendship  reaching across the generations.  </P> <P> A few years ago, I asked myself why people should want to think of, or live  for, those coming after them. I wondered what would persuade someone to do  this. I asked myself how I would define the feelings I have now that make me  want to do it.  </P> <P> Implausible as it may seem, I think it is the feeling of "parenting."  </P> <P> When people have children, they always want to build for the children's future.  They save and plan and do all in their power to make sure that their children  are provided for. They care for their worldly goods so that they can pass them  on intact, they care for the wisdom of generations so that their children will  not forget.  </P> <P> </P> <P> They Will Inherit  </P> <P> They do this because they love their children, and it is in the nature of love  to stretch and transcend limits. I think that those who come after us are, in a  very real sense, our children.  </P> <P> Generations of human beings and creatures who have not yet made their  appearance in the world will be inheriting from us. So clearly, the edge of the  family circle can't be defined by time and space. Its circumference transcends  all boundaries of past and future.  </P> <P> We are so deeply indebted to past generations that we can't afford not to be  deeply aware of those coming along after us. How much do we love them, what are  we leaving them? Are we building the "house" well?  </P> <P> Having said all this, there is one thing we did to our house that may, I fear,  never be forgiven. We took up the oak floor in the hall and dining room in  order to lay a classic, English-style black-and-white checkerboard floor.  </P> <P> "I can see them now," I said to my husband, "standing here wringing their  hands, moaning about how nobody in his right mind would rip our oak flooring to  lay vinyl. Maybe we shouldn't do it."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Placed a Letter  </P> <P> John reminded me that this was our house, our work of art. And I reminded  myself of the difference between technical excellence and original style --  reminded myself that one of the most vital ideas we can ever pass to our  "children" is that of the sanctity of the individual.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, when the installer came to lay the tiles, I gave him an envelope,  and he obediently inserted it under one of the tiles in the dining room. It is  a letter addressed to whomever tears out the black-and-white floor.  </P> <P> It is both a greeting and an apology from their friends from the past, begging  their indulgence for our one greatest liberty with "their" house. And  expressing regret that they obviously hadn't liked what we had done.  </P> <P> But at least they will know we were thinking of them, and that we cared.  </P></p>

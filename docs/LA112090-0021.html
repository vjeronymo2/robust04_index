			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS  </P> <P> Well, there goes the last 5% of our ancient forests! When the majority of the  voters defeated Prop. 130, they were indicating they agreed with that most  trenchant of comments by Ronald Reagan, "When you've seen one redwood, you've  seen them all!" Any hope that the timber industry can be shamed into reining in  its greed and leaving untouched what remains of this ancient forest is pure  wishful thinking.  </P> <P> About the only thing left for us to do for our children and grandchildren is to  add one more game to our state lottery: This game would take bets on the date  that the last redwood in that forest would be felled. At least our schools  would be given a share of the money wagered!  </P> <P> WILLIAM A. SNELL, Van Nuys  </P></p>

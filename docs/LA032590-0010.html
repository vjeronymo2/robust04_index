			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MALCOLM X  </P> <P> It is indeed a good thing that Malcolm X's life and teachings are receiving  attention from a new generation ("The Rebirth of Malcolm X," by Charisse Jones,  Feb. 4). I have taught all my students -- Afro-American, Asian, Latino, white  and "other" -- about his teachings for years.  </P> <P> But to idly dismiss the many years that Malcolm X was a racist is to miss part  of what makes him such a great inspiration. He came to understand that the  color of a person's skin is not the basis on which a person should be judged  good or bad, friend or enemy.  </P> <P> It is ironic and sad that 25 years later, the leader of the very same church  whose then-leader may have been behind Malcolm X's assassination -- the Nation  of Islam -- still preaches the hate Malcolm X came to repudiate and loathe. One  can only hope that middle-class and, more important, young Afro-Americans, as  well as all young Americans, tune into all of what Malcolm X said and stood  for, and not just take parts of his message and legacy out of context.  </P> <P> GREGG SOLKOVITS  </P> <P> MONROE HIGH SCHOOL  </P> <P> Sepulveda  </P></p>

			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / BR given go-ahead for extra carriages BRITISH RAIL has received government permission to order extra carriages worth Pounds 67.3m for the commuter trains shortly to start operating between London and north-west Kent. The decision will come as a relief to BR and its passengers because a heavy overshoot in the corporation's budget for the past financial year has placed many of its investment plans in jeopardy. The order approved yesterday is for 43 two-car Networker trains similar to the 100 four-car Networkers already ordered for the inner Kent suburban lines. The four-car trains being built by BREL, the former engineering arm of BR, and GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group, will make up eight-car formations which will start replacing the 40-year-old slam-door trains on these routes in May next year. The trains being replaced are the same as that involved in London's Cannon Street rail crash in January, which killed two people and injured more than 250. When the two-car trains start being delivered in 1993, they will be added to the eight-car trains to make up 10-car formations. BR hopes eventually to convert these trains to 12-car formations to cope with continuing traffic growth. BR had earlier hoped to win approval for new trains for the longer-distance Kent Coast routes, but these had to be dropped from the investment programme because of the corporation's financial crisis.</p>

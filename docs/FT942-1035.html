			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Publishers face delay on TV and radio group takeovers Newspaper publishers' ambitions to take over British broadcasters may have to be postponed because a growing parliamentary logjam is threatening serious delays to the required legislation. National Heritage ministers fear there may not be time in the 1994-95 legislative calendar for primary legislation on the media. That would mean reforms to allow 'cross-media' ownership might be delayed until 1996 at the earliest, along with legislation on a range of issues vital to the future of British television, such as amendments to controversial aspects of the 1990 Broadcasting Act. A delay to legislation would be a severe blow to Channel 4 in its campaign to reduce its payments to ITV companies by Pounds 50m a year. It would also be a setback to media groups such as Rupert Murdoch's News International which is thought to have ambitions to enter British broadcasting. The opposition may seek to exploit the government's difficulties by contrasting the delay in the UK with the wide-ranging plans of the Clinton administration to develop US media and information industries. Legislative proposals on key issues ranging from the future of Channel 5 and plans for digital television to white papers on the future of the BBC and the press and privacy are already considerably delayed. Whitehall departments have just lodged their bids for legislative slots and the outlines of the Queen's Speech - to be delivered in the autumn  - are expected to be decided by the end of this month or early next. National Heritage ministers fear the legislative timetable will be dominated by issues such as the privatisation of the railways and the Post Office. An interdepartmental committee on cross-media ownership is due to complete its work this summer. It is likely to recommend a relaxation of the rules that prevent publishers owning more than 20 per cent of broadcasting companies and vice versa. Primary legislation would be needed for anything other than a small increase in the permissible stake. The cross-media ownership rules are central to any further liberalisation of ITV ownership regulations. Last year's change in the rules to allow one company to own two ITV licences, except in London, was seen as an interim step. Legislative delay would hold up a legal framework for digital radio and digital terrestrial television as well as a plan to unite the two broadcasting regulators, the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and the Broadcasting Standards Council.</p>

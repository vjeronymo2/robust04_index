			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Allianz plans to make its shares more affordable Allianz, Germany's biggest insurance group, wants to make its costly shares more attractive to small investors by cutting their nominal value and thus splitting them into smaller units, according to Mr Henning Schulte-Noelle, the chairman. His statement, in an interview with the Financial Times, comes in the same week that Dresdner Bank became the first big German concern to announce firm plans to reduce the nominal value of its stock units from DM50 to DM5. This is allowed under new legislation to promote the attractiveness and efficiency of German financial markets. 'If we can make sure that trading in our shares is made easier, then of course we are interested in this whole development,' Mr Schulte-Noelle said. However, because of technical procedures over the handling of its shares (registered under individual names rather than in more easily processed bearer form) and the costs of moving to lower-denominated shares, he said this may take two years. With a closing price yesterday of DM2,466 (Pounds 1,006), Allianz's shares are among the most expensive in Germany. Dresdner's were DM408.50 and those of Deutsche Bank, also considering such a move, were DM729. Mr Schulte-Noelle said smaller denominated shares could play a role in encouraging German investors to invest more in equities. 'For small investors, it makes a difference whether they have to pay around DM2,500 for one Allianz share or DM250.' Allianz shares are among the most heavily traded on the Frankfurt stock exchange. Many big foreign investors see them as a proxy for the whole German market because Allianz has extensive stakes in companies and banks as part of its investment portfolio, earnings on which offset losses on insurance underwriting. Thus Mr Schulte-Noelle expressed strong concern over political moves in Bonn to restrict industrial holdings of banks and maybe other financial institutions. 'This is a debate we follow very, very carefully because it could possibly affect us in various ways.' If shareholdings were limited to, say 5 per cent, 'this would have a great effect on our industrial investments.' Companies in which Allianz has minority stakes above 10 per cent include BASF, Bayerische Hypo-Bank, Dresdner Bank, BHF-Bank, Munich Re, Veba and RWE. In turn, 60 per cent of its equity is owned by Munich Re (with 25 per cent), Deutsche Bank, Bayerische Vereinsbank and Dresdner Bank with 10 per cent each, and Hypo-Bank with 5 per cent. Mr Schulte-Noelle said action to curb financial stakes in industry would put a 'tremendous burden' on the stock market. 'It would drive prices down and that cannot be in the interests of the government.' He also opposed moves to limit further the number of seats anyone may hold on a company's supervisory board. 'We are big investors and if we own maybe 10 per cent of a big company, we have a definite interest in sitting on the supervisory board to see what's happening.' Finanzplatz Frankfurt, Page 16</p>

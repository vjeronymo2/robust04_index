			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / International Company News: Foreign exchange losses limit increase at Telmex Telefonos de Mexico, Mexico's largest private company, reported net profits of 4.39bn pesos (Dollars 1.29bn) for the first half of 1994, a reduction in real terms of 0.7 per cent over the same period last year. Telmex profits were adversely affected by the rise in interest rates and weakness of the peso, which caused the company to report losses on its foreign exchange dealings. Without the exchange loss, profits would have increased by 15.8 per cent in real terms, excluding tax adjustments. Second-quarter profits grew by 12.8 per cent compared with the same period last year, with exchange losses lower than expected at 186m pesos. The result was better than most forecasts and Telmex stock posted gains on the stock market. Operating profits rose by 12.6 per cent in the first half to 6.04bn pesos, and sales by 12.2 per cent to 13.84bn pesos. Revenues from domestic services grew by 19.4 per cent to 6.35bn pesos, while national long-distance revenues increased by a more modest 1.8 per cent to 4.29bn pesos, after a cut in long-distance tariffs. 'We are starting to see evidence of a re-balancing between local and long-distance revenues,' said Mr Ricardo Peon, an analyst with Baring Securities. The company says it is going to face competition in its long-distance market from 1997, and in preparation is seeking to make itself less dependent on long-distance revenues. Telmex reported further progress in its efforts to expand Mexico's telephone system, with lines in service increasing to 7.996m, up 12.9 per cent compared with June 1993.</p>

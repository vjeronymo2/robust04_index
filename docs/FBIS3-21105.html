			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nicole Beauclair: "New Step Toward Establishment </F> of Messier-Dowty"; introductory paragraph in boldface as  published]    [Text] By merging their landing gear operations,  Messier-Bugatti and Dowty Aerospace are aiming at the pole  position in the worldwide market.    Finally, on 2 December, France's Snecma and Great Britain's  TI Group signed the agreement to merge the landing gear  operations of their respective subsidiaries, Messier-Bugatti and  Dowty Aerospace. Fulfilling the hope expressed by Jean-Paul  Bechat, Messier-Bugatti's president-chief executive officer,  during an interview with AIR &amp; COSMOS last July (see AIR  &amp;  COSMOS No. 1433, page 11) in connection with the announcement  that negotiations between the two companies had begun, steps to  evaluate and set up the company were completed before the end of  the year. The fact remains that actual establishment of the  Messier-Dowty firm still requires approval by stockholders in  both firms and by national and Community authorities. That  approval is expected in the early months of 1994.    By combining the landing gear operations of the two firms,  Messier-Dowty should achieve an annual turnover of about 2.5  billion francs with some 2,400 employees divided between Great  Britain, France (the Bidos plant in Pyrenees-Atlantiques), and  Canada, where Dowty is firmly established.    When the agreement was being signed, Gerard Renon, president  of Snecma, and Sir Christopher Lewinton, president of the TI  Group, said only that Messier-Dowty would be among the world's  leading landing gear manufacturers. It is felt, however, that  the newly formed firm may take first place--ahead of the  Cleveland Pneumatic Corp., which recently joined the B.F.  Goodrich Group, and Menasco of the Coltec Industry Group.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volker Leuchsner under the rubric "Aerospace </F> Journal": "Capsule Instead of Hermes--or What Is Happening With  the Space Laboratory? New Start for Europe's Space Flights";  first paragraph is an introduction]    [Text] ESA is pinning its future hopes totally on the  launching capacity of the Ariane 5. The space laboratory is to  be adapted for this and a capsule is to be developed as a taxi.  But what Europe's ultimate contribution to a global space  station is to look like continues to be disputed.    The persistent economic difficulties in its member countries  and the latest developments concerning the American space  station are now forcing the European Space Agency (ESA) too to  reorient itself. Not even quite 10 months after the ministers'  conference in Granada its director general, Jean-Marie Luton,  presented at the end of September a new scenario that is to  serve as a guideline to the year 2000. Manned space flights  above all have been affected by the changes.    One has to adapt, Jean-Marie Luton stated. He said further  that all the same Europe must not lose its status in space  travel and has to make an independent outstanding contribution  to the future global space station. Furthermore, in the context  of financial and technological cutbacks, ESA is pinning its  hopes on European participation in the space station and on  greater cooperation with Russia. The Hermes shuttle is being  canceled completely, and the Columbus world space laboratory is  to be integrated in a diminished version into the new Manned  Space Transportation Program (MSTP). Because both versions of  the space station that are being discussed at present--with and  without Russian participation--are now planning the docking of a  European module not until the year 2002, the entire program is  to be extended to this point in time and 4 billion European  currency units [ECU] (8.2 billion German marks [DM]) are to be  saved. Expenditures of ECU22 billion (DM45.1 billion) were  planned in the Granada plan for the years 1993 to 2000, and  these are now to be limited to ECU18 billion (DM36.9 billion)  for the years 1994 to 2002. Everyone is being affected by hard  times, the ESA chief said. The most important thing now, Luton  said further, is to reorganize on the basis of clear performance  targets and broad agreement and to remotivate the European  partners in this manner.    The foundations of the new scenario are the Ariane 5, whose  development is to be sped up further without cuts, and the trio  consisting of the APM (Attached Pressurized Module) space  laboratory, ATV (Automated Transfer Vehicle) transfer vehicle  and CTV (Crew Transport Vehicle) capsule, integrated into the  MSTP program. At around DM14 billion, the CTV and ATV transport  elements are to cost only approximately a third of what was  estimated for Hermes. All three basic elements are to be  designed so that they can be launched by an Ariane 5. The APM  laboratory module is a diminished version of the Columbus  module. Only five double racks for scientific experiments,  instead of the originally planned eight, are to have a spot in  it. With a total mass of around 10 tons and a payload of 1.7 to  3.4 tons, it is approximately equivalent to the Spacelab.    A ballistic re-entry capsule, that for reasons of cost is  not  to be reusable, is planned for the transport of astronauts and  cargo. In the manned version it is to be able to transport from  four to nine persons to the space station. The CTV is  accordingly three times as large as the Soyuz and is to be  simpler to handle and more precise when landing, Luton  emphasized. The European design would also be ideally suited as  a rescue capsule.    The MSTP system will be completed with the ATV transfer  vehicle. It is necessary in order to take the laboratory and the  capsule to the space station and to dock them automatically  there. Two versions weighing 12.7 and 14.5 tons are being  examined at present.    The Ariane 5 would accordingly be the third carrier system  in  addition to the Shuttle and the Russian rockets able to succeed  in placing a space station in a 400-km-altitude orbit with an  inclination of 51.6 degrees, as planned for the global station.  Kourou's location close to the equator presents further  advantages here. Europe's new carrier rocket could, that is, as  it is being developed at the moment, carry 18 tons to a station  in this orbit. This is something absolutely new, and a  strengthening of Europe's position. In the original planning for  Freedom the Americans permitted only Shuttle flights and charged  a lot of money for them.    However, ESA's new plans also include an independent  scenario  for the case of cases that an international space station does  not come off. Equipped with a logistics module and solar cell  paddles, the APM could also orbit alone around the earth.  Jean-Marie Luton emphasized in closing that the paper in  question is a strategy document and is to serve as a reference  point for the next two years. The first actual decisions are to  take place not until at the next ESA ministers' conference at  the beginning of 1995.  <H3>  BDLI [Federation of the German Aerospace Industry] Fears  Further Loss of Jobs </H3>   It is uncertain whether ESA will manage to succeed with this  plan with every member country. Though Federal Research Minister  Kruger and his French and Italian colleagues agree that  Europe in any case is to take part in phase two of the  American-Russian space station, however, as it looks, there are  various opinions about this. The new head of DARA [German Agency  for Space Affairs], Dr. Jan-Baldem Mennicken, said to the press  on this matter at the beginning of October, "It is also being  considered whether it is not possible to do without an  independent laboratory and integrate Europe's contribution into  a joint international laboratory." Mennicken said further that  this has to be discussed in the near future with ESA and the  industry. Timetables, costs and any disadvantages have to be  taken into consideration here. The maintenance of the industry's  technological capacity will play a decisive role in this  discussion. But the APM is still a stipulated part of the  program, he stressed.    The chairman of BDLI's space flight working group, Horst  Rauck, demanded in this connection, in the light of further cuts  in funds, "The Europeans have to take part as equal partners in  the global space station." Keeping the German contribution for  ESA at the earmarked sum of DM1.172 billion is the prerequisite  for this, he says. Otherwise the further weakening of Germany as  a site for industry and the loss of high-technology jobs are to  be feared, he stressed. What will remain at the end, with the  shrinking process of the Columbus European space station, is  written in the stars. The Freeflyer was stricken off the list a  long time ago already, and the docked laboratory (APM) has been  scaled down and postponed once again. We will wait and see.</p>

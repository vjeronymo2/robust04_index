			<p>BFN     [Text] The [word indistinct] sector in St. Kitts-Nevis has  received a boost, with the establishment of a new lending  institution on the island. We get the details from (Via  Gallaway):    [Begin recording] [(Gallaway)] The prime minister, the right  Honorable Dr. Kennedy Simmonds, while delivering an address of  the opening of the new branch of the Royal Bank of Canada said  that the commerical banks in St. Kitts and Nevis play an  important role in the overall developmental thrust through the  wide array of banking and financial services they provide. He  commended the Royal Bank of Canada for the confidence it has  placed in the continued growth of the economy, adding that it  has helped to provide a variety of modern conveniences. He also  attributed to the solid performance of the economy over the past  decade and our strong infrastructure base on the policies of his  government.    [Simmonds] All of these entities have been effected from the  very liberal [word indistinct] regime and the [words indistinct]  investment climate that my government has created through  variety of creative fiscal and economic policies. In fact, my  government is now providing new incentives for companies to  undertake developments of this nature. Hence, the 1994 budget  provides that companies may now enjoy capital allowances in  respect of new commercial buildings, the construction of which  commence on or after matched across 1994. Hence, as I said  [words indistinct] company limited and other companies continue  to invest and expand, we will enjoy additional tax relief.    [(Gallaway)] Meantime, the vice president for the Barbados  and Eastern Caribbean area, Mr. Douglas Maloney, said that the  reason for the establishment of the bank was trade. The Royal  Bank of Canada had begun life as the Merchants Bank of Halifax.  At the turn of the century, the merchants found many  opportunities in a [word indistinct] trade financing between  Canada's maritime provinces and the Caribbean. He said at the  time, sugar, cotton, and spices were being traded and the Royal  Bank was kept busy providing banking services to importers and  exporters on all of the islands. Governor of the Eastern  Caribbean Central Bank, Mr. (Dwight Brenner), said a great deal  of concern is being expressed about impact of the North American  Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, on our economies. He disclosed that  in the OECS [Organization of Eastern Caribbean States], you have  to be very careful to continue to maintain a rational approach  in matters of this kind and not succumb to the [word indistinct]  "Join at all Costs" imperative, which Mr. Brenner noted seems to  be the case elsewhere in the region.    [(Brenner)] In a situation where some countries are claiming  to be NAFTA eligible, we in the OECS have to remember two  things: firstly, that in the new atmosphere of trade and  financial liberalization, [words indistinct] national economy,  countries must prepare themselves to be internationally  competitive, whether there is a NAFTA or there is not. Secondly,  a competitive environment is based on getting the economic  fundamentals right. And in this area, the OECS countries have  done remarkably well for countries of their size.    [(Gallaway)] The new branch of the Royal Bank of Canada is  located at the [word indistinct] Complex on Wellington Road. I  am (Via Gallaway) reporting for the Caribbean Evening News.</p>

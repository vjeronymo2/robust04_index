			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / India plans more currency liberalisation soon THE INDIAN government, which this week floated the rupee on foreign exchange markets, is planning further currency liberalisation 'in the near future', Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said yesterday. Mr Singh told a press conference he was considering ending restrictions on the amounts of foreign exchange Indians could take out of the country for travel and other purposes covered by the current account. 'We want to go for full current account convertibility in the near future,' he said. Mr Singh was commenting on the annual budget, which he presented on Saturday and which contained wide-ranging economic reforms, including the liberalisation of the rupee for trade-related transactions. This involves the abolition of a system of dual exchange rates - a free-market rate (last week about Rs31 to the US dollar) and an official rate (Rs26 to the dollar). By abolishing dual rates, Mr Singh hopes to boost business for exporters, who can now exchange all revenues at market rates. However, the government will have to pay more for imports. The exchange markets were closed yesterday to give bankers time to consider the changes. When dealings start today, Finance Ministry officials expect the rupee to settle close to last week's free market rate. Some foreign exchange dealers believe there could be wild swings in early trading as dealers try to find a level for the currency. However, the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has the right to intervene in the market and its trading capacity is very large in comparison with that of the commercial currency dealers. So it could dampen fluctuations it considered excessive. Meanwhile, Indian stock prices dropped sharply yesterday, following a similarly precipitous decline on Saturday, as investors judged that the budget fell short of their expectations. The chief disappointment was the finance minister's failure to cut corporation tax or capital gains tax. The Bombay stock exchange's index of leading shares fell 81.22 to 2,571.18, after losing 160 on Saturday. The decline reflects investors' belief that a cut in corporation tax would have been an immediate boost to profits. Industrialists, mostly having a longer-term horizon, have reacted much more positively to a budget which has brought big cuts in import duties and domestic sales taxes - moves which give scope for increasing margins. After the budget, the Finance Ministry must now prepare for negotiations this month with the International Monetary Fund for a loan to help tide India over any unexpected balance-of-payments problems. The IMF, which is monitoring India's reforms, has supported the country so far with a stand-by credit which expires at the end of the current financial year this month. For next year, India hopes to negotiate exceptional financing of about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.76bn). The 1993-94 budget includes measures welcome to the IMF, such as customs duty cuts, a reduction in the fiscal deficit and financial sector reforms. But Mr Singh has not gone as far as the IMF would wish. The government's target for the fiscal deficit is 4.5 per cent of GDP, whereas the IMF would like it to be under 4 per cent. Mr Singh made clear yesterday he had gone as far with liberalisation as political considerations allowed. 'The world has to accept that India is a functioning democracy,' he said.</p>

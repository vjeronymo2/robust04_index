			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (20): The Germans head west - New BMW and Mercedes Benz plants in the US 'Build the plant, and they will come.' So could have said BMW and Mercedes Benz about suppliers following in their paths to invest in the US states of South Carolina and Alabama, respectively. For these investment hungry south-east states, the collateral investment by the suppliers to the two German luxury carmakers is a dream come true. With their new US plants, both BMW and Mercedes are positioning themselves to compete more fiercely in the US, the world's largest car market, and to do so with far lower production costs than in pricey Germany. The hourly wage of German workers costs BMW, for example, about Dollars 25, whereas in South Carolina it will pay Dollars 12 to start and Dollars 16 after two years. Mercedes reportedly estimates that building the new car in Alabama will cost 30 per cent less than if built in Germany. Both manufacturers intend to export the cars. But it is not only labour that will come cheaper for the two German companies. They have designed advanced state-of-the-art plants to pare down on their own relatively more expensive manufacture or assembly of numerous component parts. In this, they are leading the way in an industry that is increasingly de-integrating. Both firms will only supply critical systems - such as engines, transmissions and suspension - and the rest will come from component manufacturers, which bid for contracts. To assure quality and timeliness, the two German car makers are requiring their suppliers - a majority of which are US companies - to work closely with them in the design of the components. Mercedes has gone slightly further than BMW in this regard. Its plant in Alabama will basically only bolt and weld together a series of modular systems of parts that are already assembled. BMW is spending at least Dollars 300m on its plant in Greer, South Carolina, which is expected to produce its first car before the end of September. The plant, which starts making 318i's and 325i's and next year adds a new small two-seater sports car, will employ 2,000 people and produce 400 cars per day by 1998. Mercedes has construction of a Dollars 300m plant under way in Vance, Alabama in the western county of Tuscaloosa. It will start producing a sports utility vehicle (akin to a Range Rover) in early 1997. Both companies expect that their final investment will be several hundred million dollars more. BMW's investment in Greer, a tiny town between the two South Carolina county seats of Greenville and Spartanburg, has already brought 12 suppliers into the area. BMW expects eventually to have a total of about 70 suppliers to its South Carolina plant, some 24 of which are expected to locate in the state. Robert Hitt, spokesman for BMW in South Carolina, says that for the new roadster, 'local content will be about 50 per cent'. Ten of the 12 BMW suppliers have construction under way in South Carolina or are already producing, including: Lear Seating, a top US seat systems manufacturer; Lemforder, a subsidiary of the German firm Lemforder Metallwaren AG, for front axles; Zeuna Staerker, a Germany subsidiary for mufflers; Plastic Omnium, a French subsidiary, for bumpers and fuel tanks; Electro Wire, a US firm, for battery cables and some wire harnesses; Magna International of Canada for side panels and floor pans, and Alfmeier, a German subsidiary, for fuel valves. Some suppliers were already nearby in South Carolina, including Michelin, the French tire maker, and Robert Bosch, the German automotive parts company. A local firm, Spartanburg Steel, will supply body parts. And Milliken &amp; Co, the US textile giant that is based in Spartanburg, will supply interior and boot fabric. At least one supplier so far will supply the US plants of both BMW and Mercedes. Packard Electric, a leading US manufacturer of wire harnesses, will build service centers in South Carolina and Alabama to accommodate the two German firms. The service centers will be for distribution of harnesses assembled in Mexico from US and European components. But they will also be equipped and staffed to alter or re-engineer the parts if needed. Another BMW supplier, Lemforder, will supply parts to Mercedes through ZF Friedrichshafen AG, which will be supplying Mercedes front and rear axles from a Tuscaloosa plant. BMW has also found that what is good enough for its South Carolina plant is good enough for its German factories. Lear Seating initially won the contract to supply BMW's plant in South Carolina and will now supply its operations at home. Mercedes will be taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement for supplies from Mexico and Canada. Lighting systems and air induction sytems will be made by two German subsidiaries in Mexico, EOSA in Mexico City and Filtros Mann in Naucalpan. The Budd Company of Canada will supply frames and a US subsidiary of the Kautex Corporation will supply fuel systems. Because it is using innovative modular systems, Mercedes expects eventually to have only 40-50 suppliers. 'On average,' said Lee Dennis, Mercedes' purchasing manager in Alabama, 'automotive OEMs have 300-400 separate parts suppliers.' While there may be 300-400 parts, Mercedes is arranging its supplier relationships so that it depends only on its first tier of key modular suppliers, who in turn assembled components. The goal for Mercedes local content, said Mr Dennis, will be 65 to 70 per cent of the vehicle. He expects to have 90 per cent of Mercedes suppliers selected by the end of the year. As production begins to roll off the lines in South Carolina and Alabama, the two German companies hope to prove not only that they can build superior quality cars in the US, but also that they can do so far more cheaply than at home.</p>

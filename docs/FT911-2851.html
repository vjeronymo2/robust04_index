			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / World Stock Markets: Amsterdam forges ahead on the stronger dollar - The bourse's recent rally SO FAR in April, Amsterdam has more than lived up to its reputation as one of the most dollar-sensitive stock markets in the world. As the dollar has gone from strength to strength, Dutch shares have forged ahead. The bourse has not only hit several new highs for the year and risen nearly 20 per cent since January 1; it also stands just 5 per cent below all-time highs reached in the summer of 1989. Despite these gains, most analysts are cautious about the outlook for the market over the next few months. The dollar is the only clearly positive factor propelling the Dutch market higher. For all the benefits derived from the upward march of the US currency, the Amsterdam bourse - and the Dutch economy generally - are crucially dependent on events closer to home in neighbouring Germany, the Netherlands' biggest trading partner. The increasing challenge of achieving German unification threatens to keep Dutch interest rates high and may push them up even further, leading to an almost inevitable correction in Dutch share prices. At the same time, the Dutch government faces difficulties in meeting its own targets for reducing the country's financing deficit, raising the prospect of political tension within the ruling centre-left coalition. 'We continue to think that the recent market advance is discounting too much good news,' Credit Suisse First Boston Nederland say in a recent report. 'Compared with the prevailing interest rates, shares look expensive.' The dollar's decisive influence on Amsterdam is a reflection of the strong international orientation of the bigger Dutch companies, many of which have long outgrown their domestic market. Thanks to the rise of the dollar, companies with significant turnover in the US or in the dollar zone will be able to translate their foreign sales into a greater number of guilders. For example, Aegon, the insurer, generates 35 per cent of its revenue in North America, while Ahold, the supermarket group, rings up as much as half of its turnover along the US east coast. Both these companies' shares touched 12-month highs in April, as have defensive food and beverage stocks such as Wessanen, Bols and Heineken and the chemical stocks Akzo and DSM. Royal Dutch Petroleum and Unilever, which together account for half of Amsterdam's market capitalisation, also stand to benefit from a firmer dollar, and their share prices have climbed accordingly, briefly setting new 12-month highs this month before falling back slightly. Overall, the CBS General Index, which reached a year's high of 201.5 on Thursday, has risen 19.9 per cent in 1991. The index slipped 1.9 to 199.6 yesterday. Since mid-March alone, the gain has been 6.3 per cent. The dollar's rise has proved equally remarkable, recovering from a post World War Two low of Fl 1.64 in mid-February to Fl 1.98 this week. The general index broke through 200 in mid-April, the first time it has done so since July 1990 and putting it close to the August 1989 high of 210.5. However, analysts caution that macro-economic conditions in the Netherlands have altered greatly since the height of the 1989 boom, making the Amsterdam bourse more vulnerable to a downward correction. Mr Fokko Tuin, an analyst at Kempen &amp; Co in Amsterdam, notes that long-term interest rates are now 2 points higher than they were in the summer of 1989, Dutch economic growth has slowed significantly and wage levels are rising, putting additional pressure on corporate profits. 'From a historical point of view, share prices in Amsterdam are certainly not cheap, although they are still not expensive compared with abroad,' he says. He adds that because part of the recent rise was motivated by expectations of lower interest rates in the second half of 1991, share prices could fall later in the year if the forecast decline in interest rates does not emerge. Ms Nora Coers, an account manager at stockbrokers Theodoor Gilissen, says there seems to be little room for further major rises, adding that a correction, if it comes, could send the market 4 to 5 per cent lower. Another cause for concern is the fact that many Dutch companies - currently presenting their 1990 annual results and reports - are reluctant to make profit predictions for 1991 because of the uncertainties ahead. With only the firm dollar to sustain it in the short-term, Amsterdam's recent rally can be explained in part,also, by two long-term factors which provide underlying support to Dutch share prices, according to Mr Tuin. Dutch institutional investors who, traditionally, have held only small share portfolios compared with their Anglo-Saxon counterparts are gradually expanding their share purchases. Because they do not have the same currency considerations as foreign institutions, Dutch pension funds and insurers tend to buy and hold on to their share investments. Their perspective is more long-term than foreign buyers, helping to explain the demand for shares of more cyclical companies such as Hoogovens and DAF. Both companies expect a difficult 1991 before seeing an improvement later in 1992. Another factor lending support is the prospect of a gradual removal of the anti-takeover defences erected by Dutch companies to ward off hostile bidders. These defences, which are frequently blamed for low Dutch price/earning ratios compared with other markets, are likely to be curbed in future by new European Community regulations.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 KYODO -- The coalition cabinet of  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned en masse on Monday  morning after 260 days in office and 17 days after Hosokawa's  sudden resignation announcement over financial improprieties.    The resignation paves the way for the election of Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, 58, as his successor in the Diet on  Monday afternoon and formation of a second coalition government.  Hata is assured of winning the Diet vote for prime minister due  to the coalition's majority in both houses.    Hosokawa and his 20 cabinet ministers tendered their  resignations in an emergency cabinet meeting that convened at 10  AM [0100 GMT]. The cabinet disbandment followed Friday's  agreement among coalition parties to push Hata as a successor to  Hosokawa.    The Hosokawa administration turned out to be the sixth  short-  lived one in post-World War II Japanese political history after  the cabinet of Kijuro Shidehara, who held power for 226 days in  1945 and 1946. Hosokawa, 56, leader of the Japan New Party,  took office on August 6 last year as the first prime minister  from outside the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which lost its  majority in the House of Representatives in the general election  the previous month after a series of political scandals hit the  LDP. He described his seven-party coalition administration as a  "political reform government." In pursuing his avowed goal of  cleaning up Japan's so-called "money politics," Hosokawa pushed  a package of electoral and political reform bills through the  Diet in January, which replaced multiseat districts in the lower  chamber with a mix of single-seat constituencies and  proportional representation.    Ironically, Hosokawa himself fell from grace after he came  under fire over allegations that he had raised funds in dubious  ways via a 100 million yen loan from the scandal-tainted Sagawa  Kyubin trucking business group in 1982 and purchase of shares of  telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp.  (NTT). Hosokawa said that he repaid the 100 million yen loan  and dismissed any corruption charges over the NTT share  purchase, which he stated was conducted by his late  father-in-law. A previous scandal surrounding Sagawa Kyubin  helped topple the LDP from power, paving the way for Hosokawa's  alliance of conservative LDP splinter groups and traditional  opposition parties such as the Social Democratic Party to sweep  to power.    Hosokawa's public support ratings, higher than 70 percent  immediately after he took office last August, plunged in recent  weeks to sag below the 50 percent line in recent media polls.    On April 8, he made his bombshell resignation announcement,  citing "new suspicions" over his personal finances as a major  reason for his decision to give up the premiership and said he  would take "moral responsibility."    Namio Yatsuka, an aide to Hosokawa, told reporters last  Friday that the premier failed to report to tax authorities  personal income of 29 million yen from stock and bond  investments during a 10-year period from 1981.</p>

			<p><P> March 15, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY HEARS THE SHOOTING;  </P> <P> GANGS: FROM PASADENA TO POMONA, DRIVE-BY VIOLENCE HAS EXPLODED ACROSS THE  SUBURBAN LANDSCAPE. BUT NUMBERS DON'T TELL THE WHOLE STORY.  </P> <P> The tiny yellow house near the Pomona railroad tracks was to be Marie  Rodriguez's refuge from gang life.  </P> <P> The month before, she and her two young children had gone to stay there with a  friend, leaving behind her husband and, she hoped, the violent rivalries that  have plagued the city for generations.  </P> <P> But on the morning of Feb. 13, as the 23-year-old snack bar employee was  helping clean house, she discovered how difficult it is to flee a war in which  anyone can be considered fair game.  </P> <P> In a scene played out nearly every day somewhere in the San Gabriel Valley, a  car passed slowly by, a gang name was shouted out and several rounds from a  shotgun were pumped into the bungalow. The apparent target: a rival gang member  who had come over to offer use of his vacuum cleaner.  </P> <P> Instead, the lead pellets tore into the head of Rodriguez's son, Daniel, a  Little League baseball player who had celebrated his seventh birthday just  weeks earlier. Also hit was Olga Perez, 23, the friend who had given them a  place to stay. Perez survived but Daniel died after four days in intensive  care.  </P> <P> "I left . . . to get away from this," Rodriguez said as she waited that first  night in the hospital. "I just want it to stop."  </P> <P> From Pasadena to Pomona, Altadena to Claremont, drive-by shootings have  exploded across the suburban tracts east of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> In cities where gang attacks were rare 10 years ago, the drive-by reached  record proportions in 1989. Pasadena, for instance, was so hard hit that  officers for the first time began keeping a daily tally of the shootings, the  only San Gabriel Valley police department to do so.  </P> <P> By year's end, the number had reached a staggering 108 -- at least a 50% rise  over the previous 12 months.  </P> <P> In many other communities where long-standing gang rivalries had fizzled over  the last decade, the drive-by returned with a vengeance. Baldwin Park logged 68  such shootings last year. The Industry area, including La Puente and Valinda,  had more than 50, and tiny San Gabriel recorded 11.  </P> <P> To a large extent, those figures reflect a rise in gang activity throughout Los  Angeles County, where gang-related homicides have gone up 23%, from 452 murders  in 1988 to 554 in 1989.  </P> <P> But numbers alone don't tell the story of what happens when bullets fly  indiscriminately, turning innocent bystanders, both young and old, into  victims.  </P> <P> Although drive-by shootings are usually intended as retaliation against rival  gang members -- not as random violence -- someone other than a rival gang  member gets hit 20% to 50% of the time, according to various law enforcement  estimates.  </P> <P> "Basically, they're not very discriminating as to who they shoot," said  Pasadena Police Sgt. Monte Yancey. "And they don't seem to have much of a  conscience."  </P> <P> As a result of drive-by shootings in 1989, a middle-aged Monterey Park woman  was hit in the face by stray shotgun pellets while waiting for a bus, a  35-year-old Pasadena man was wounded as he stood in line next to two gang  members at a hamburger stand, and three young Pomona men, ages 20, 18 and 17,  were killed on a street corner, allegedly by gang members upset that they  wouldn't join the gang.  </P> <P> A 12-year-old Rosemead boy was shot in the leg and thigh as he chatted with a  friend in his driveway. Two high school football players from Baldwin Park were  wounded, allegedly by gang members who mistook their car for that of a rival.  And 21-year-old Michael Carrillo, a former San Gabriel resident who had moved  to Missouri, was killed by shotgun blasts to the face and chest last September  during a visit back to the community where his parents still live.  </P> <P> Carrillo was not a gang member, police say, but had been outside talking with  old friends on a street that another gang considered rival turf.  </P> <P> "Just another case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time," said San  Gabriel Police Detective Kenneth Butler. "He wasn't even dressed like a  gangbanger. He was wearing these little shorts and could have easily fit in  with a bunch of kids at a party on Huntington Beach."  </P> <P> Things were not like this before.  </P> <P> Those who work closely with gang members say there has been an erosion of  respect in recent years, a willingness to commit violent acts that even  hardened gangbangers had previously considered unacceptable.  </P> <P> The reasons, say counselors and probation officers, include a new generation of  smaller cliques that don't play by the rules of the older gangs, and the  emergence of immigrant gangs from Mexico and Central America without ties to  the traditions of longtime Chicano gangs.  </P> <P> In addition, they point to the lawlessness engendered by the growth of the rock  cocaine trade and a general sense among many of these youths that the line  between right and wrong has been blurred by politics and warfare around the  world.  </P> <P> "They see viciousness, duplicity and stealing all around them," said Mike  Duran, director of specialized youth services for the Los Angeles County  Probation Department. "You tell me where people are honest with each other. The  kids pick up on all these negatives and closely emulate them.  </P> <P> "It's almost to the point of having to go back and retrain these guys," Duran  added. "Tell them, 'Go ahead, be a gang member but . . . have some respect for  yourself and people around you.' "  </P> <P> In Pomona, many look back to an April 3, 1987, shooting at Holy Cross Cemetery  as the point at which things took a turn for the worse.  </P> <P> Four people, including two girls, were wounded when rival gang members opened  fire on a crowd of several hundred mourners who had come to bury a young man  gunned down in a drive-by shooting the week before.  </P> <P> Two months later, four more people were wounded when a gunman fired into a  crowd of youths who had gathered in a park to view a movie promoting  alternatives to gang violence.  </P> <P> As disturbing as those incidents were, 1989 ended up as Pomona's most violent  year ever, with 44 murders. Nineteen of the victims were killed in drive-bys,  which numbered more than 100.  </P> <P> "If they kill a baby, they don't care," said Lt. Chuck Brantley, who works in  the sheriff's anti-gang program, Operation Safe Streets. "They feel no remorse.  They're doing what they were brought up to believe is right. In their own  minds, they're soldiers."  </P> <P> Others, however, say the emotions are more complex. The fatal shooting last  month of 7-year-old Daniel Rodriguez, for instance, troubled many people in the  Cherrieville community, home to the gang member suspected of committing the  murder, said Rudy Gutierrez, who grew up in the neighborhood and now works with  high-risk youths at Fremont Junior High School in Pomona.  </P> <P> "Nobody liked that Daniel got hit," Gutierrez said. "Some might not say  anything, because they've been conditioned to think, 'Well, he just got in the  way.' But they're still human. They still hurt."  </P> <P> He applauded the mother whose 16-year-old boy is suspected of the shooting for  turning her son in to police the next day. "I thought that was pretty noble,  myself," Gutierrez said. And he praised the boy, whose name was not released  because of his age, for accepting her rule.  </P> <P> But police rarely get that kind of cooperation. Drive-by shootings are among  the most difficult crimes to solve, officers say.  </P> <P> Even if there are witnesses, many are afraid to testify for fear of  retaliation. And if gang members are wounded, even critically, they frequently  refuse to provide police with any information about their assailants.  </P> <P> "There's been times when a guy's been shot and he's in the hospital and we've  explained to him, 'You may die,' " said Baldwin Park Police Lt. Michael  Bennett. "And they always say, 'I'll take care of it myself, or if I don't  live, my home boys will take care of it.' "  </P> <P> It is a culture, though, that has left many San Gabriel Valley communities  untouched. More than half a dozen cities in the region had no drive-by  shootings last year, including San Marino, South Pasadena, Arcadia, Irwindale  and La Verne.  </P> <P> To be sure, a few towns not known for major gang problems did suffer from  drive-bys, including Monrovia with a dozen, Claremont with five and Glendora  with one.  </P> <P> But, for the most part, the shootings were limited to low-income neighborhoods  with large minority populations.  </P> <P> They are the kinds of neighborhoods where most gang members reside and the  kinds of neighborhoods where most victims, whether from rival gangs or not,  also live and die.  </P> <P> "What happens is these gangs stereotype their victims," said Deputy Dist. Atty.  Dennis E. Ferris, who handles hard-core gang cases at the Pomona courthouse.  "To them, any young black or Hispanic male in a rival neighborhood is fair  game. You might say these guys are as much racists as anyone else."  </P></p>

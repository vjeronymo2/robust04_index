			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Conflict With Iraq: Kuwait still rebuilding its armed strength THE CLASHES in the Gulf over the past week have highlighted the continuing weakness of Kuwait's armed forces. They are still in the earliest stages of rebuilding after the Gulf war two years ago and do not alone have the manpower or equipment to mount a credible military deterrent to Iraq. A pre-war total of about 25,000 armed forces personnel has shrunk to nearer 16,000 after Kuwait's military authorities ejected thousands of Bedouin, or stateless Arabs, who made up the core of the army's fighters, judging their loyalty to be suspect. Although Kuwait's air force is being reinforced by the arrival of 40 F-18 jets ordered before the war, the undermanned ground force is equipped only with 150 Yugoslav-built M84 tanks and little support equipment. Recently-ordered M1A2 tanks from the US are unlikely to be in effective service for up to two years, and Kuwait has still not decided on a large contract for armoured personnel carriers. The country has no air defence system of its own, relying for radar cover on US early-warning aircraft operating out of Saudi Arabia. However, western officials in Kuwait say there are ample forces in the country to deal with any Iraqi aggression. Last week the US deployed a 1,100-strong US task force equipped with pre-positioned M1A1 tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles. It also has 300 special forces troops on exercises in Kuwait. A small Gulf force, including a Saudi Arabian armoured brigade, is also still based in Kuwait. Diplomats say that Iraq's remaining ground forces, which at best represent 40 per cent of its pre-war military strength, are tied up in northern Iraq and in fighting with Shia groups in the south. Several Republican Guard units are at present deployed around Baghdad. 'There's no way any force of any size could turn south and head for Kuwait,' said one. Western officials also discount any threat from whatever Scud missiles Iraq may have kept hidden. Short of an outright invasion, the Iraqis could however still provide niggling harassment at the newly demarcated border with Kuwait. This is straddled by a 15km-wide demilitarised zone under the jurisdiction of the 249 unarmed officers of the United Nations. It is with this threat in mind that the Security Council is considering whether to bolster, with armed and possibly armoured forces, the UN Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission contingent. Neither reinforcements from Britain or France, or UN troops already in Kuwait, would be likely to be deployed to police the border.</p>

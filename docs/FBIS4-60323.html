			<p>BFN     [Text] Presidential Council member brother 'Abd-al-'Aziz  'Abd-al-Ghani this morning visited the site hit by a missile  fired yesterday evening by the gang of apostasy and secession.  The missile fell in a neighborhood of Sanaa, killing or  wounding a number of civilians and destroying a number of  inhabited houses.    'Abd-al-Ghani was accompanied by brothers Najib Ghanim, the  minister of public health; Husayn [surname indistinct], the  mayor of Sanaa; Mutahhar Zaki, under secretary at the Ministry  of Information; and Dr. Ahmad Makki, under secretary at the  Ministry of Public Health.    The Presidential Council member and his companions were  briefed on the material and human losses inflicted by the  missile. They expressed their vigorous condemnation of this  criminal attack that targeted defenseless civilians and their  property.    He told the local, Arab, and world media that the Yemeni  people will reply to these criminal acts, and will not show  patience toward the secessionist move.    The brother Presidential Council member and his companions  then visited the wounded at the Republican Hospital and  inspected the structural damage to the hospital itself,  including operating rooms.    Brother 'Abd-al-Ghani regretted the consequences of this  criminal act that targeted a humanitarian facility in the  capital. He later visited the General Revolution Hospital and  called on the victims of the attack.    We beseech God the almighty to speed up their recovery.    The Ministry of Public Health directed that the patients be  afforded all the necessary medical and other services.</p>

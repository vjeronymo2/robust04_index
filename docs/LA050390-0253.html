			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> 'CHEERS' CAN LIVE, DANSON SAYS  </P> <P> Ted Danson says "Cheers" could survive his departure.  </P> <P> "It's a very depressing thought, but it's true. The show has a life of its  own," said Danson, who will return for a ninth season but isn't sure about a  10th.  </P> <P> "I'm taking the summer off to think about it," said Danson, who plays the  Lothario bartender Sam Malone on the NBC series.  </P> <P> Danson is filming "Three Men and a Lady," a sequel to the 1987 box office smash  "Three Men and a Baby." He also appeared in the 1989 movies "Cousins" and  "Dad."  </P> <P> "The question is whether I want to hang around and do a 10th season," he said  recently. "I just don't have the legs anymore to run around for eight months  doing 'Cheers' and then run around three more months doing movies."  </P></p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (24): Only worth it if you go the distance - With-profits policies NOBODY WITH a blank sheet of paper would invent the UK's 'with-profits' system as an ideal way to look after investors' money. But having evolved into its present convoluted shape as the gift of history, the with-profits system has proved to have its uses. This year, though, belief has mounted that the system now carries the seeds of its own destruction. In essence, with-profits policies offer exactly the deal which product providers have fallen over each other in the last year to offer - a guaranteed return plus a share of any strong market performance if there is any (see G for Guarantees). But the system started as a form of straight life assurance in the 19th century, and has only recently evolved into an investment vehicle. With-profits is most often sold in the form of an endowment life policy. This is a variant of life assurance where a sum is guaranteed either when you die, or, even if you survive, at the end of a fixed period. Life companies soon realised that it made sense to invest the premiums they took in to safeguard the payments to policyholders. Then they made profits above the level of the sum guaranteed. And then they started making pay-outs to policyholders with the profits of the investments. Hence the term. The profits are added in the form of bonuses. These come in two forms - reversionary, or annual, bonuses, which are added on to the value of the sum assured each year and then cannot be taken away; and terminal bonuses, which are only added once the policy has matured. The former normally need to be supported by gilts or other fixed-interest securities, so the use of terminal bonuses allows life offices more freedom to invest widely and search for the best profits. However, the terminal bonus, unlike the reversionary bonus, is not guaranteed from one year to the next. If an office paid out a hefty terminal bonus one year, there is nothing to stop it cutting this the following year. Some companies have multi-tiered bonus systems, where bonuses are announced each year both as a proportion of the sum assured and of the reversionary bonuses which have already accrued. The final pay-out at the end of the endowment's term will consist of the sum assured plus all bonuses. In theory, the build-up of reversionary bonuses makes this a stable investment, smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the market which might afflict investors in unit-linked products. Investment performance by the with-profits fund is the prime factor in determining bonuses. Typically, funds are mostly invested in equities, topped up with holdings in bonds and property, providing a balanced portfolio. With-profits funds can also benefit from money made out of 'non-profit' business, which does not pay out if the policyholder is still alive at the end of the term. But beware the big difference with unit-linked contracts. These investments have a direct mathematical link to the value of the underlying fund, which the company must pay out. Bonuses and pay-outs for with-profits funds are decided entirely at actuarial discretion. If actuaries get it wrong one year, they must correct it the next. This can lead to perverse results. In 1990, when the market fell, life insurers decided that the fall was only a temporary blip, and maintained bonuses. This was a mistake, which ate into their reserves. It meant that this year, although the market has risen, bonuses and pay-outs have had to be cut throughout the industry. These bonuses also reflect lower expectations for future returns. Non-investment factors also come into play. If a company's reserves have fallen, it may be necessary to cut bonuses just to ease the pressure. Actuaries must also look at the amount of business which is about to mature. If they only have a few maturities in the coming year, it will not cost them much to make apparently generous pay-outs. These in turn make it easier to 'window-dress' and sell new policies. Companies faced with a large bubble of maturing business, however, have a nasty habit of paring pay-outs to the bone. So with-profits is not as intrinsically stable an investment as it seems. Values can wobble on the basis of minor human errors unconnected with investment conditions. The other pitfall of the with-profits system is that all of this assumes that you hold on to the investment to maturity. None of the terminal bonuses apply if you surrender the policy early, because you will have breached the contract with the life company. Early surrender values are calculated on a completely different basis, and they normally offer far inferior yields to those on offer to those who hold on to policies to their maturity. A Money Marketing survey found last year that three offices paid out less than half as much for a 24-year surrender than they did for a 25-year maturity. Commissions (see F for Fees and Commissions) and other expenses are front-loaded, so if you give up a 25-year policy within the first two years  -and, according to the Securities and Investments Board, this was the fate of 23 per cent of with-profits policies in 1990 - you will barely have paid for the costs of selling and setting up the policy, and so will receive a negligible amount. With-profits policies can only offer good value for money if you hold on for the long term, and by signing up for one you are signing away the flexibility which unit-linked products can offer.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------               With-profits payouts (Pounds ): 10-year policies  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                                     1993     1992  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- RNPF Nurses                                7,705    7,943 Royal London                               7,323    7,628 Tunbridge Wells Equitable                  7,292    8,087 Commercial Union                           7,164    7,484 Norwich Union                              6,992    7,532 Clerical Medical                           6,958    7,576 Friends Provident                          6,885    7,457 Scottish Provident                         6,844    7,129 Standard Life                              6,839    7,672 Scottish Mutual                            6,613    6,923 General Accident                           6,590    7,024 Scottish Life                              6,216    6,926 Sun Alliance                               6,005    7,060 Guardian Royal Exchange                    5,022    5,479  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- As at February 8, 1993 Policies started by 29-year-old man, paying monthly premiums of pounds30  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

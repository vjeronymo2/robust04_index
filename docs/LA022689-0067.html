			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> WHY DOES THE NOSE KNOW? NO ONE KNOWS  </P> <P> Scientists know a lot about smell. They know that it weakens as we get older,  that it varies depending on a person's sex and ethnic background and that it  involves more than just the nose. What they generally don't know is why.  </P> <P> "Within the scientific community, smell has always taken a back seat to the  other senses, probably because we don't live in an olfactory world. We live in  a visual world, a world of sounds," said Dr. John S. Kauer, a New England  Medical Center researcher trying to determine brain function using the nose.  </P> <P> Last year he used video cameras and special dyes to trace the path of an odor  impulse through the brain of a salamander. The work produced a "movie," or  series of color-enhanced pictures, showing that the brain is "a parallel  processor," handling many signals simultaneously, like a supercomputer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Alzheimer's Link  </P> <P> The research may have implications for the study and treatment of brain tumors  by helping differentiate between tumors and normal tissue.  </P> <P> Scores of researchers are poking their noses into such olfactory oddities as a  link between premature decline in smell and Alzheimer's disease, a protein that  ferries odor molecules through the nose, the fact that half of all people  between ages 65 and 80 suffer major loss in the sense of smell and the trait  peculiar to some nasal nerve cells to regenerate.  </P> <P> "They're the only neurons in the human body that undergo this spontaneous  renewal and spontaneous decay," Kauer said.  </P> <P> Some of the research in the field of smell is aimed not at medical advancement  but at the bottom line. In Union Beach, N.J., Dr. Craig Warren heads a research  and development team for International Fragrances and Flavors Inc., a company  that produces scents for soaps, perfumes and other products made by hundreds of  companies around the world.  </P> <P> Smell, Warren said, "is the one sense for which the mechanism for perception is  unknown." Scientists know how odor molecules are gathered by smell neurons, but  they don't know how a few similar types of receptor cells can distinguish  between thousands of different odors.  </P> <P> Research suggests that the process of smelling involves more than the nose,  Warren said. When blindfolded, "Most people cannot discriminate a lemon from a  lime or an orange from a grapefruit."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Small Samplers  </P> <P> International Fragrances and Flavors regularly brings in dozens of smell  samplers, usually women, to rate and react to fragrances, with emphasis on how  the fragrances can alter mood. In the process, Warren has found that 10% to 15%  of the subjects display a particularly acute sense of smell.  </P> <P> At the opposite end of the spectrum are those with no sense of smell.  </P> <P> Mary Brooks, 35, of Philadelphia, took an uncommon route to this fairly common  problem. Beginning in 1972 she began to experience what amounted to smell  hallucinations; she thought she smelled an unpleasant odor when there was no  odor present. Years of anguish and unsuccessful treatment finally led to brain  surgery in which her olfactory nerve was removed, ending her hallucinations but  leaving her incapable of smelling.  </P> <P> "It can be very dangerous," she said. "I've already burnt things in the oven  and I didn't know it, and there are smoke alarms everywhere. But on the other  hand, it doesn't bother me not to smell because I still sense that I'm  breathing and smelling the same as you are."  </P> <P> Brooks' doctor was Richard Doty, director of the University of Pennsylvania  Smell and Taste Center. Patients include the aged and professionals like wine  tasters, firefighters, police officers, gas company workers, inspectors and  cooks whose lives and livelihoods can depend on the sense of smell.  </P> <P> "There have always been problems that people had and they've had no place to  turn in the past," Doty said. "It's a frontier of science which really hasn't  even been touched on."  </P> <P> That's no accident, Kauer said. "Our world doesn't require it. We really don't  go out and forage for food by sniffing along the ground. That evolution took  place millions of years ago."  </P> <P> Doty, Daniel A. Deems and Stanley Stellar published a report in August in the  journal Neurology linking the loss of smell and Parkinson's disease. A year  earlier, a similar study linked the loss of smell to Alzheimer's disease. A new  area of research will try to determine if the nasal passage serves as a pathway  for viruses or chemicals that contribute to those maladies, Doty said.  </P> <P> The general subject headings scientists have explored give an idea of the scope  of smell research: the influence of body tilt on the sense of smell and the  effects of mouth movement, swallowing and spitting.  </P> <P> Studies of ethnic groups have turned up some interesting distinctions:  Korean-Americans appeared to have particularly acute ability to identify  smells. Black Americans in one sampling had trouble with cedar and cheddar  cheese. Whites had trouble with gingerbread. Native Japanese scored poorly on  clove and fruit punch.  </P> <P> Despite this mountain of research, a key question that puzzles scientists is  precisely how the sense of smell works.  </P> <P> At Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Solomon Snyder identified a carrier protein  last summer that ferries odor molecules up the nose. The discovery occurred  inadvertently in a search for receptors that play a key role in distinguishing  smells, Snyder said.  </P> <P> "But another possibility as to why the receptors haven't been found is that  they don't exist."  </P> <P> Other factors -- sight, sound and environment, for example -- help provide the  brain with cues in identifying smells, he said, but "the fundamental  discrimination is going to be in the nose."  </P></p>

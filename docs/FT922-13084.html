			<p>920414 FT  14 APR 92 / Insurers may see heavy bomb claims UK INSURERS, already facing the worst losses in their history, could have claims of Pounds 1bn as a result of Friday's bomb damage to the City. Britain's leading five composite insurers, which reported pre-tax losses of more than Pounds 1.2bn in 1991 and Pounds 650m in 1990, will be among those hit. The loss, however, is widely spread in the London insurance market. Two hundred buildings were affected, half of which sustained structural damage. Damage and associated losses amount to up to Pounds 300m and glass replacement will take at least a month. Claims for business interruption and loss of profits, for which most companies insure, could swell the total. Repair work began as the City struggled to restore some normality amid the wreckage. New windows at the 23-storey Commercial Union building, the tallest in the City when it was built in 1969, will cost Pounds 1.5m and take at least 15 weeks to instal. Pilkington, the glass manufacturer, was working round the clock transporting glass from St Helens. The Corporation of London said no buildings would need to be demolished. However, 10 buildings in St Mary Axe, including the Baltic Exchange, the Chamber of Shipping and the Royal Bank of Scotland, were classed as severely damaged. The Baltic Exchange and CU, which bore the brunt of the blast in which three people died, were both returning to normal trading. The CU was to have held its annual and extraordinary general meetings in the Baltic Exchange today. The meetings will now take place this afternoon at The Brewery, Chiswell Street. The 650 staff who work in the CU tower have been relocated, some to other London offices and about 400, including senior management, to four CU buildings in Croydon. The Baltic Exchange, the headquarters of which was wrecked by the bomb, pledged to restart trading tomorrow in the Lloyd's of London building. It intends to resotre its ornate Edwardian building - which Mr Peter Tudball, the chairman, described as 'one of the most beautiful in the City of London'. Staff at James Capel, the securities house, worked through the weekend to construct a replacement dealing room from scratch. A soldier leaving an Army careers office in Derby was shot and critically wounded by three young men yesterday. Police were keeping an open mind about a terrorist connection.

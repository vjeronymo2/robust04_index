			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Unocal Ends Car-Junking Program: The Los Angeles-based oil company concluded  its program to buy heavily polluting cars and scrap them as a way to cut  vehicle emissions, saying that the company had junked 8,376 pre-1971 cars. The  company estimated that the program, under which Unocal paid car owners $700  each for their junkers, resulted in a reduction of 10.7 million pounds of  pollution from the air, or about 53% more than originally expected.  </P></p>

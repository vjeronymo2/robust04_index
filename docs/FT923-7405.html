			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / Ramos changes tack on Marcos Philippine President Fidel Ramos yesterday withdrew his backing for a judge's decision to dismiss 11 criminal cases against former first lady Imelda Marcos, Reuter reports from Manila. Mr Ramos had told reporters earlier in the day that the 11 currency violation charges filed against Mrs Marcos had 'become moot and academic' because of a decision this month to liberalise foreign exchange rules. However, Mr Ramos's remarks contradicted positions taken by Central Bank Governor Jose Cuisia, Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon and government prosecutors, who said they would appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

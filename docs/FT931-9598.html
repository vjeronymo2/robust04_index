			<p>930212 FT  12 FEB 93 / UK Company News: French affair that ended in radio silence - Crown Communications was enthusiastic about its investment in the RFM network, but the move eventually led to its demise NOBODY REALISED it at the time, but the high point for Crown Communications and Mr Christopher Chataway, its chairman, came early in 1989. On February 6 Crown came top of the Financial Times Leaders and Laggards charts for 1988 with a rise in its share price for the year of no less than 409 per cent. In an 18-month period the shares had gone from 40p to a peak of 274p and Crown made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.25m in the 12 months to September 1989. A few weeks later Mr Chataway, a former Conservative minister, enthused about the opportunities in France as Crown bought into RFM, an emerging French commercial radio network. It was the beginning of the end for Crown, darling of the Unlisted Securities Market, owner of LBC, the London talk station and a company with stakes in more than a dozen other UK radio stations and a rapidly expanding television business. 'A great mistake was made in France and in the end that proved fatal,' says Mr Chataway, talking in detail for the first time of the nightmare which led to Crown's receivership last month with debts of Pounds 16m. Mr Chataway, who is also chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, adds: 'It was France that brought the company down. The original investment was a bad one.' He happily admits that both he and Mr David Haynes, chief executive, were enthusiastic for the venture at the time. The Crown chairman believes that they got 90 per cent of the analysis right. It was then or never for an outside investor. Networks were beginning to emerge from the chaos of French commercial radio with its thousands of competing stations. There was serious money to be made. In fact there were disastrous flaws in the analysis, which Mr Chataway readily admits. 'We weren't equipped to deal with the French broadcasting environment. Despite thousands of stations it is quite a closed world.' It was difficult selling advertising as an independent competing against large groups such as Europe or NRJ. They never, he says, found a manager really capable of effectively running a French radio station. On top of that the ever changing French regulatory system was a quagmire. 'You may be in the radio business and have people who understand radio, but radio is a much more national business.' says Mr Chataway. In short they made virtually every mistake in the book. Less than 18 months after taking managerial control of the network, which has 114 stations either owned or affiliated, Crown compounded its errors. By the summer of 1990 the company had started to realise what a mess it was getting into and asked Lazard Freres, the merchant bank, to seek a buyer. The search, never to be consummated, further underlined the radio network's stability. 'In retrospect what one ought to have done was close it down - if one had known how long the recession was going to last in the UK and therefore the pressures one was going to be under,' says Mr Chataway. Mr Patrick Meyer, founder of RFM, is scathing about the Crown management. He sold 35 per cent of his stake to Crown, 30 per cent went to Credit Mutuel d'Artois et de Picardie and he retained the rest. Crown, however, took full managerial control and equally full responsibility for both development costs and losses. 'They didn't know the job and they can't blame anyone else. They changed formats all the time. They did everything wrong from the beginning,' says Mr Meyer, who now lives in Arizona. Apart from changing formats, Mr Meyer claims that Crown: Spent money unnecessarily, advertising the station before the format had settled down Installed a production studio when there were plenty in Paris to hire Misjudged the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the French broadcasting authority, and how it was likely to react. 'They have been very incompetent, which is sad because the people are fair. David Haynes seemed to be the person who knew what he wanted. He brought people together. He was very very very sure of himself. I think Mr Chataway had a more humble approach,' said Mr Meyer, who plans to approach the French receiver to buy his network back. Soon after the RFM acquisition Crown encountered a series of difficulties, aggravated by the recession. The merger of BSB with Sky meant the end of a lucrative television news contract. The move to new headquarters at Hammersmith, London - inevitable because the company's existing central London lease was running out - increased costs. It also took a lot longer than expected to cope with the split of AM and FM frequencies to create two separate services. LBC, however, is not in receivership and has floated free of the Crown debris after a financial restructuring. Mr Chataway and other Crown directors insist that without RFM Crown could have coped with its other problems and survived the recession. Instead the company spent much of the past two years selling its remaining radio stakes in the UK to service debt and losses, while increasingly despairing attempts were made to sell the RFM holding. They ran into a brick wall last month when the CSA turned down a sale to a consortium that included the rival network NRJ and Mr Alain Ayache, owner of Le Meilleur magazine. The CSA issued a bitter statement accusing Crown of taking control of 70 per cent of the capital of the company without permission and failing to distribute 21 per cent to the staff and management as promised. Crown denies this, says the CSA was fully informed at every stage and hints at darker French political machinations. The sale of RFM was turned down, Crown believes, partly at least because of heavy lobbying from rivals who wanted to make sure NRJ did not get its hands on another network. Mr Chataway says that he informed Mr Jacques Boutet, the CSA president, in a letter on February 4 that Crown no longer intended to sell 21 per cent to management and that the shares were still in the name of Mr Patrick Meyer. Who precisely controlled RFM has been a thorny issue from the outset. The agreement between Crown and Mr Meyer was confidential. Both Mr Chataway and Mr Meyer insist that Mr Meyer did indeed own the shares he said he owned, rather than merely holding them on behalf of Crown. Mr Meyer also emphasised that Credit Mutuel always acted like real shareholders, taking an active part in board meetings. Mr Chataway says all the shareholder agreements were drawn up by Freshfields, Crown's Paris lawyers, and were given to Price Waterhouse, the company's auditors, and summaried in the annual report. It is believed that the confidential shareholder agreements provided for Crown to acquire more shares from Mr Meyer in due course, where this was permitted by the CSA. What has the debacle cost the Crown chairman? His investment of Pounds 170,000 was once worth Pounds 2m on paper and now is worth nothing. 'I don't suppose anyone benefits from being associated with a company that goes into receivership. But I am certain I was right to stay on. If I had left at that point (when the problems began) I could have rightly been criticised for leaving a sinking ship,' says Mr Chataway, who has decided to step down as LBC chairman. Mr Chataway, who speaks serviceable French, declares himself still a Francophile - though he is no longer much of a fan of French radio.</p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Israeli owners of a luxury hotel at the center of a border dispute between  Egypt and Israel agreed to a $37-million settlement, an Egyptian official said.  Fuad Sultan, Egypt's tourism minister, said the two countries agreed on how  much revenue the owners of the 322-room Sonesta hotel in the Gaza Strip would  receive, the Middle East News Agency reported. Sultan, who headed the Egyptian  side since the talks on the issue started in Cairo on Feb. 6, said agreement  has also been reached on future management of the hotel. However, Israel and  Egypt are still negotiating on compensation for a tourist village on the Taba  resort, at the head of the Gulf of Aqaba.  </P></p>

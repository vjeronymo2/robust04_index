			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Lyudmila Aleksandrova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 19 TASS -- Russian political parties  and public organisations assess quite differently the draft  agreement on civic concord, submitted for approval by the  Russian president. Their assessments range from support in  principle (although not without reservations) to unequivocal  unacceptance.    The Russian Party of Free Labour (RPFL) has on the whole  supported the appeal of the public chamber under the Russian  president. However, as noted in its recently released  statement, "the proposed form of civic concord in Russia  envisages few mutual political guarantees by the agreement's  signatories, ensuring its achievement". The party believes that  "the governing structures demand more guarantees from public  movements, without ensuring social-political stability by  reciprocal readiness to make concessions and compromises". The  document, the RPFL believes, does not clearly fix the concrete  responsibility of governing structures for possible deviations  from the initialled agreement.    The All-Russia "Business Roundtable" Association has  supported the principles on which the draft on the civic concord  agreement is based "in spite of some disturbing theses", and has  urged all the political parties and movements to actively help  work out mechanisms for its implementation.    The Association of Private Farmers and Agricultural  Cooperatives of Russia believes that the president and the  government should assume a commitment in the agreement to  steadfastly expand the land reform.    The "New Russian School", a foundation which rallies  teachers, higher and secondary school instructors, workers of  juvenile and cultural-educational establishments, has announced  its support to the draft agreement.    The Club of "Realists", a moderate centrist organisation,  headed by Yuriy Petrov, chairman of the State Investment  Corporation, has released a statement objecting to "an illusion  of concord or specially concocted myth about concord". The  members of the club believe that everything in this agreement  "testifies either to the naivety of its authors or to their  desire to use this text merely as a tactical weapon to combat  everybody who dares not share these or other aspects of the  policy pursued by the administration and the government". At  the best, the document will play no role at all, and at the  worst (and this is most probable) will increase the existing  social confrontation, the authors of the statement claim. They  have advanced other principles on which, in their opinion, the  civic concord agreement should be based.</p>

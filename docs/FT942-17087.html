			<p>940407 FT  07 APR 94 / Chilean police chief row President Eduardo Frei of Chile yesterday threatened to convoke the National Security Council to force the resignation of his chief of police, General Rodolfo Stange, writes David Pilling from Santiago. Under the 1980 constitution, drawn up by the military, the president cannot dismiss commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, of which the police chief is one, although President Frei has made it clear he believes Gen Stange's position to be untenable. The chamber of deputies added weight to President Frei's cause by passing an emergency motion describing as 'regrettable' Gen Stange's refusal to resign after being implicated in an alleged cover-up of the 1985 murder of three communists.</p>

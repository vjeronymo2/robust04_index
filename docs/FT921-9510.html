			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / Election fever gains sway over political parties in Germany ELECTION fever is beginning to overtake political horse-trading in Bonn's corridors of power, as the April polling day in two key regional elections - in south-western Baden-Wurttemberg and northern Schleswig-Holstein - looms closer. Yesterday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), served notice that they will table within two weeks a controversial amendment to the German constitution to restrict the sweeping right of refugees to political asylum. The move is a blatant pre-election manoeuvre, for it will not be put to the vote before the polls. At the same time the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) are set to reject the government's tax reform package on Friday, in the upper house of the German parliament, in a counter-attempt to gain electoral advantage. The SPD also announced yesterday it will not vote in favour of ratification of the EC Treaty of European Union, signed in Maastricht on Saturday, without improvements being negotiated. It hardened its charge against Mr Kohl that he had failed to gain an adequate deal on political union to match concessions he made on monetary union. Most of the manoeuvring has an air of shadow-boxing, yet it does concern the most contentious issues of the day. The CDU's trump card for the elections is public indignation at the rising tide of asylum-seeking and immigration. The SPD and the Free Democrats (FDP), junior partners in the coalition government, reject anything so drastic as a constitutional change to restrict rights of asylum. The CDU and CSU argue anything less will fail to stem the tide coming from eastern and southern Europe, and the third world. The state of the economy, and above all the rising burden of taxation to pay for unification, is the focus of the SPD's campaign. Its leaders are hammering away at Mr Kohl, saying he won the unification election - in December 1990 - with a 'tax lie,' that he would not raise taxes to pay for it. The government's current proposal, for an increase in value-added tax from 14 to 15 per cent next year, is presented as another back door tax rise to pay for unification. Baden-Wurttemberg is critical for Mr Kohl. It is the last western state ruled by the CDU, after a series of disastrous regional defeats in recent years, and a bad result would gravely undermine the credibility of the federal government. However resentment at the rising flow of asylum-seekers into the prosperous south-west should help him. In Schleswig-Holstein, the SPD is on the defensive. The party's national chairman, Mr Bjorn Engholm, is state prime minister. His image is one of a likeable intellectual who does not really want to be chancellor, an image he needs to allay with a decisive victory. So the CDU is tabling radical reforms on asylum which stand no realistic chance of being approved (both the SPD and FDP oppose them), and the SPD is opposing a tax package the central element of which - the VAT rise - seems certain to get eventual acceptance.</p>

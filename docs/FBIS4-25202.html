			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Summary of an interview with Chinese Vice Premier and </F> Foreign Minister Qian Qichen by TOKYO SHIMBUN Chairman Miichiro  Kato at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing on 13 April]    [Text] [Kato] The deadline for the United States'  decision on the renewal of most-favored-nation (MFN) trade  status for China is drawing near. What do you predict?    [Qian Qichen] "If the United States does not want to cut off  its economic relations with China, then problems should be  settled. There is a very strong view supporting an extension of  the MFN status among American business leaders."    [Kato] Hopes are placed on China's role in persuading North  Korea to accept nuclear inspections by the International Atomic  Energy Agency [IAEA]. How does China view the situation, and  what is China's role?    [Qian Qichen] "China does not want to see the issue  discussed at the UN Security Council [UNSC]. We have been  stressing that the issue should be settled thorough negotiations  in three channels involving four countries -- between North  Korea and the United States, between North and South Korea, and  between North Korea and the IAEA. I am sure some progress will  be made if they patiently continue to hold negotiations within  this framework. There is the possibility that if resolutions  should be adopted at the UNSC at the present stage, the current  framework for dialogue will be broken, and that mutual  contradiction will further deepen. China has maintained its  position that the UNSC should announce a non-binding statement  by the UNSC president."    [Kato] North Korea has rejected the statement. What do you  think of it?    [Qian Qichen] "North Korea's rejection of the statement is  understandable because it opposes the UNSC taking up the issue.  It appears the situation is gradually moving in the right  direction after the announcement of the presidential statement."    [Kato] Is it correct that underlying China's emphasis on  patient persuasive efforts is its conclusion -- based on its own  information -- that North Korea's nuclear development is not  imminent or that China bases its position, while judging that  North Korea's nuclear development is in progress, on its fears  that there is the possibility that North Korea will take  unexpected action if pressure is applied to North Korea?    [Qian Qichen] "(Concerning progress in North Korea's nuclear  development) it is difficult to make a clear judgment. The IAEA  says that North Korea already has a five-megawatt reactor, and  that a larger reactor is under construction. But at present,  there is no evidence that proves the transfer of radioactive  materials. China has no right to check North Korea's nuclear  facilities. China, for its part, insists that the Korean  peninsula should be denuclearized. If a military conflict should  break out there, it will greatly affect China and Japan, as well  as the surrounding nations. But the United States is over  10,000 kilometers away."    [Kato] Is there any schedule for mutual visits by top  leaders of both China and North Korea?    [Qian Qichen] "Absolutely not."    [Kato] If the United States decides on an extension of the  MFN trade status to China, will it be easier for China to  persuade North Korea?    [Qian Qichen] "The two problems are completely different."    [Kato] Japan, while facing trade friction with the United  States, has indicated its intention to obtain a permanent seat  in the UNSC. What do you think of this?    [Qian Qichen] "Japan-U.S. trade friction has long existed  and is an unavoidable issue. China also has a similar trade  issue with the United States. I think the issue will be solved  through thorough negotiations. Regarding Japan's becoming a  permanent member of the UNSC, there is a difference in views  among members of the United Nations, and the issue has not  officially come up on the agenda of the UN session."</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Major wants to end automatic honours MR JOHN MAJOR wants to overhaul the honours system with the aim of ending automatic rewards for civil servants and others who reach a particular rank or length of service, it emerged yesterday. The prime minister is sympathetic to the growing criticism of the civil and military honours, which many mandarins, MPs and members of the armed forces receive almost by right  - rather than for their contribution to society. Downing Street officials emphasised, however, that 'nothing is going to happen in the immediate future'. Mr Major believes he made a start in changing the priorities for awards in last June's Gulf war honours list, when he deliberately put emphasis on rewarding meritorious service regardless of rank. Reforming the honours system would fit Mr Major's pledge to push for a 'classless' society. Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, reinstituted political honours, including hereditary peerages, for long-serving politicians. Changes to the system would, however, be supported by many Tory MPs. Sir Peter Emery, chairman of the Commons procedure committee, said: 'The honours system has a role to play in British society but it should be based on merit and the individual contribution of a person  - rather than the length of time they have served in a particular job.' Mr Richard Shepherd, Conservative MP for Aldridge-Brownhills, said on BBC Radio: 'The automatic assumption that you get knighthoods or gongs is, I think, very out of date.' Other senior backbench Conservative MPs would also back reform of the honours system but, perhaps looking at their own prospects, refused yesterday to comment publicly.</p>

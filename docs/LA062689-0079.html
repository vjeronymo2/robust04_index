			<p><P> June 26, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOYNER FINDS HAPPINESS IN POST-WALLY WORLD  </P> <P> "Wally World" is no more. Its originator and curator, Wally Joyner, said so  Sunday afternoon after the Angels' 7-6 victory over the Orioles at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> When Joyner came to Anaheim in 1986 as a baby-faced, 24-year-old first baseman,  he took the town by storm. He drove in 100 runs and hit 22 home runs as the  Angels came within a strike of making the World Series. He hit 34 home runs and  drove in 117 runs the next season.  </P> <P> Not only was a star born, but an entire world. It was "Wally World" and Anaheim  Stadium was his personal stage.  </P> <P> But this business of hitting home runs has always been a little foreign to  Joyner.  </P> <P> "I'm not a home-run hitter," Joyner said Sunday. "I drive the ball into the  alley and drive in runs."  </P> <P> Two years ago, most people would have laughed at that explanation, but not now.  The facts back Joyner's assessment.  </P> <P> Sunday, he hit only his second home run of the season and his first in 169  at-bats. It was only his second homer since Sept. 1, 1988, a total of 352  at-bats.  </P> <P> So what's wrong?  </P> <P> Nothing, according to Joyner. Although the home runs aren't coming the way they  once were, Joyner said he's content to hit for average and drive in runs.  </P> <P> That thinking has served him well lately. He's hitting .291, up from .236 a  month ago, and has hit in 28 of his past 31 games. He's also batting .391 in  the past 18 games.  </P> <P> And the third-inning homer and a two-run double in the first inning Sunday  pushed his RBI total to 27.  </P> <P> "I think I created some expectations in other people's minds, but not mine,"  Joyner said of his first two seasons. "I'll probably never hit 34 home runs in  a season again. But if I don't hit 34 home runs in a season, if I don't hit 20,  does that mean I'm unsuccessful?"  </P> <P> If Sunday's performance is any indication, Joyner has forgotten what it's like  to hit a home run.  </P> <P> At the crack of the bat in the third inning, Joyner began running and running  hard. He said he didn't see the ball clear the fence in right-center field.  </P> <P> "I was watching the center fielder (Mike Devereaux) and he kept running, so I  kept running," said Joyner, who never broke into a home-run trot.  </P> <P> "I guess I haven't had too much practice."  </P> <P> Joyner appears happy to have finally broken out of the slump that reduced him  to hitting in the low .200s for the first two months of the season.  </P> <P> "I felt like my best game this year might have been yesterday," he said. "I hit  the ball hard four times."  </P> <P> Joyner was three for four in Saturday night's 8-3 victory over the Orioles.  </P> <P> His two-for-four afternoon Sunday included a sharply hit double down the  right-field line in the first, scoring Dick Schofield and Devon White to give  the Angels a 2-0 lead.  </P> <P> Joyner's leadoff homer in the third started a four-run inning that chased  Oriole starter Jeff Ballard.  </P> <P> "I got underneath it," Joyner said. "I got some backspin on the ball, hit it in  the air and the ball went out."  </P> <P> Joyner figures if he keeps hitting the ball hard, the home runs will come,  maybe not as many as before, but "Wally World" wasn't created in a day.  </P> <P> "Hopefully, those numbers will come back," Joyner said.  </P> <P> But does Joyner ever miss those bygone days of numerous home runs and of "Wally  World"?  </P> <P> "No," he said. "I don't know if 'miss' is the right word. It was the right time  and place for it to happen. But it's gone."  </P></p>

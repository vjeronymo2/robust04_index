			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / International Company News: Renault chief stands firm on terms of Volvo merger No changes can be expected to the terms of the proposed merger between Renault and Volvo, according to Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman of Renault. 'The terms and conditions are final from the French side,' Mr Schweitzer told the Financial Times late on Tuesday. 'The deal is fair and we have fully answered the concerns of Volvo shareholders. This is it, there is a time for decisions,' he said. Mr Schweitzer yesterday met with a group of leading Volvo shareholders in Paris in an attempt to counter Swedish resistance to the proposed merger. Opposition from Volvo shareholders has already forced the postponement of a vote on the deal - originally due earlier this month. A new vote has been set for December 7. A group of 12 Swedish institutions controlling 44 per cent of the votes in the Swedish company hold the key to approval of the deal. The French government has sought to win backing for the merger by giving written commitments to Volvo shareholders concerning the two most controversial aspects of the deal: the timetable for privatisation, and the use of a golden share to be held by the state. Last week, Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, wrote to Mr Carl Bildt, his Swedish counterpart, stating the French government's intent to privatise the merged company next year, and pledging that the golden share would not be used against Volvo. Mr Schweitzer warned that a rejection of the planned merger between Renault and Volvo would damage existing co-operation between the two automotive groups, which are already engaged in a far-reaching alliance based on minority cross shareholdings. 'The momentum would disappear,' said Mr Schweitzer. 'You cannot work together without a strong sense of direction. And there would be none.' He said recent disruption to the merger process had already slowed and destabilised efforts to build a joint management organisation. The Renault chairman said he had been surprised by the scale of opposition from Swedish investors. 'Emotions built up in a rather violent way and have overshadowed the issues and the progress we have made. It has become a political issue in Sweden,' he said. Mr Schweitzer stressed the industrial logic of the proposed merger, due to take effect from the beginning of next year. The cost-savings from joint purchasing, research and development and economies of scale would strengthen the two companies' car and truck operations. Mr Schweitzer said the European automotive markets showed signs of bottoming out. He forecast a modest recovery in demand from mid-1994. He said he was confident that Renault would remain profitable despite the protracted downturn in the car and truck markets.</p>

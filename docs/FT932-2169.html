			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / Books: Back to the future SING THE BODY ELECTRIC by Adam Lively Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 15.99, 440 pages THE WEATHER IN ICELAND by David Profumo Picador Pounds 12.99, 310 pages THOMAS Mann did it so well in Doctor Faustus and subsequent writers have failed so dismally that any idea of a novel about a fictitious composer ought to be aborted as soon as it is conceived. But here is Adam Lively, inventing the biography of one Paul Clearwater (born 2030, died 2099) as the springboard for an ambitious novel of ideas about the power of music and creativity. Pitching the story into the next century allows Lively to detach his ideas from the reality of the 20th-century, and offer a teasing timewarp of artistic life 70 years on. The opening, though, could not be less auspicious. The novel begins with a sequence of Clearwater's letters in which he recounts to his sister his arrival in 2064 in the complacent backwater of Wellfleet, after he has fled from the big-town superficiality of New Venice. Even were one not already profoundly suspicious of a composer who could have written an opera called The Crooked Timber of Humanity, Clearwater's letters dispel the final drops of sympathy: he shows himself to be pompous, overweening and pretentious, and possessing an unbelievably precious and thoroughly reactionary view of his calling. Of course that is partly Lively's point. But it is a bold, not to say foolhardy ambition to begin a major novel with more than 120 pages that flesh out a a portrait of a thoroughly disagreeable main character. Yet when the mode changes and Lively lets his own writing peep through there is never quite the gust of fresh air the book so badly needs. He chronicles Clearwater's love affair, and when the novel dips into SF comes up with the invention of the Neurorch, which allows the brain's electrical impulses to be synthesised as sound. It becomes the rage of New Venice, Clearwater enthusiastically embraces it and finds his creativity cruelly, terminally stifled. Not before time, the reader might think. For a novel and a novelist so keen to say something about music and the act of musical creation, Sing The Body Electric is woefully short on insight. The cliches begin with the title and barely let up; in moving forward almost 100 years musical evolution seems to have stepped back 200 - Clearwater's Big Idea is to write a Sea Symphony. There is no attempt to imagine what the next century might think of ours in musical terms; no success either in making Clearwater or any other character into thinking, feeling beings. The Weather in Iceland also takes place in the future, though David Profumo's tale of the declining of the upper classes is set only five years hence. In 1998 Britain has been taken over by a military junta and a disenfranchised aristocrat Richard Slide, Duke of London, has been exiled to Switzerland, from where he can look back on his family's history with ironic detachment. There are some useful picaresque touches, some boldly imagined setpieces, but nothing to give Profumo's tale relevance or point, nothing to make the reader care for Slide's lost world; unless, presumably, one shares his world of privilege and nostalgia and feels a pang at its theoretical passing.</p>

			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: American International Group reports after-tax profits of dollars 458.9m AMERICAN International Group yesterday reported after-tax profits of Dollars 458.9m in the fourth quarter of 1992, up from Dollars 399.8m in the same period of 1991. The figures included realised capital gains of Dollars 13.2m and Dollars 10.3m respectively, writes Nikki Tait in New York. The quarter's results take AIG's net profits total for the year to Dollars 1.66bn, against Dollars 1.55bn in 1991. The 1992 figure includes realised capital gains of Dollars 64.2m, up from Dollars 60.7m in the 1991, and a Dollars 31.9m boost from accounting changes. The insurer noted that, like most of the industry, it had been badly hit by catastrophe losses last year - to the tune of over Dollars 190m  - but attributed the results to the spread of its business. For the year overall, AIG's general insurance division produced operating profits of Dollars 1.12bn, a decline of 9.9 per cent from 1991's Dollars 1.25bn. Feeling the impact of catastrophe losses, the underwriting deficit rose from Dollars 4.8m to Dollars 195m, while net investment income increased from Dollars 1.16bn to Dollars 1.25bn. On the life insurance side, operating profits rose from Dollars 561.8m to Dollars 667.4m, while the financial services division overall made an operating profit of Dollars 346.4m, up from Dollars 222.2m.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] His Excellency President Daniel arap Moi today at  State House, Nairobi, received a high-level Japanese economic  and technical delegation. The leader of the delegation, Mr.  Masao Sawaki, informed President Moi that Japan would increase  its funding of specific projects to Kenya by 50 percent in the  next five years. Mr. Sawaki said Japan placed Kenya in high  esteem, especially due to her rapid development. This, he said,  was the reason the delegation came to reappraise its support for  Kenya's development.    President Moi thanked the government and people of Japan for  their enormous contribution to Kenya's development since  independence. He added that, because of this support, Kenya  regarded Japan as a true friend and partner in development and,  noting that he was committed to environmental conservation as it  guaranteed the success of future development efforts, the  president said he would appreciate assistance to construct  several dams in the country.    He informed the Japanese delegation that Kenya's rapid  development was mainly due to the uninterrupted peace since  independence and the participation of wananchi [citizens] in the  harambee [communal fund-raising] self-help strategy. President  Moi said he attached great importance to security and added that  the issue would be given the attention it deserved. [passage  omitted]</p>

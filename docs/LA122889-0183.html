			<p><P> December 28, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 2 NORIEGA COHORTS EXIT EMBASSY;  </P> <P> PANAMA: U.S. DETAINS SENIOR OFFICERS AS HALF A DOZEN OTHER FUGITIVES REMAIN  INSIDE.  </P> <P> U.S. forces detained two senior Panamanian military officers as they left the  Vatican Embassy in Panama City where their former commander, Gen. Manuel A.  Noriega, remains holed up, a U.S. military spokesman said today.  </P> <P> They are navy commander Col. Arnulfo Castrejon and armed forces chaplain Lt.  Col. Carlos Velardes, Southern Command spokesman Col. Jerry Murgia told a news  conference. "They remain in U.S. custody," he said.  </P> <P> Panama Archbishop Marcus McGrath said about half a dozen other fugitives remain  in the embassy with Noriega.  </P> <P> "The obvious intention is to arrive at a moment where he will be the only  person living inside the Vatican Embassy. It should happen today or tomorrow,"  he told reporters.  </P> <P> The two officers who left the nunciature were on the armed forces general staff  and Castrejon was a member of the Military Strategic Council, a select group of  officers close to Noriega.  </P> <P> Murgia said the two had been arrested in the last 24 hours but did not say how  long they had been in the nunciature. Castrejon was previously reported to have  surrendered to the U.S. Army and Murgia did not explain the discrepancy.  </P> <P> He said that another member of Noriega's general staff, Lt. Col. Rafael Cedeno,  the deputy director of military intelligence, had surrendered in the last 24  hours.  </P> <P> Spanish state radio said today that two senior Panamanian officers who took  refuge inside the nunciature with Noriega have asked for political asylum in  Spain.  </P> <P> It identified them as the former director of the National Department of  Investigation, Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, and Noriega's personal security  chief, Capt. Eliecer Gaitan.  </P> <P> Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez told the radio that if no  lawsuit is pending against the officers there should not be any problem for  them to settle in Spain.  </P> <P> But he said their biggest difficulty would be whether U.S. troops surrounding  the mission would allow them to pass.  </P> <P> The standoff at the Vatican Embassy, where Noriega took refuge from invading  U.S. troops on Christmas Eve, continued with troops and tanks ringing the  building in the seaside Paitilla district of Panama City.  </P> <P> U.S. troops, adopting a novel way of reminding the fugitive of their presence,  play rock music and news reports on the standoff at high volume over a  loudspeaker.  </P> <P> Washington has threatened to seize Noriega and send him to the United States to  face drug charges if he sets foot outside the sanctuary of the embassy. But the  White House acknowledged today that the resolution to the standoff is in the  Vatican's hands.  </P> <P> The Vatican has ruled out turning Noriega over to the United States and  diplomats say it is seeking to hand him over to Panama or a third country.  </P> <P> McGrath said a solution to the Noriega problem would have to satisfy the  minimum positions of all parties involved. "Whatever time needs to be taken  should be taken, otherwise the decision will be hasty and destructive," he  said.  </P></p>

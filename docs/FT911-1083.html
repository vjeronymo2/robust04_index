			<p>910508 FT  08 MAY 91 / UK News (Employment): W. H. Smith to retrain managers in motivation W. H. SMITH, the multiple retailer, is to retrain up to 300 of its managers. The decision follows an internal survey finding that staff thought managers were far better at decision-making than at motivating employees and creating a happy working environment. Some board members of W. H. Smith Retail may be among those who will be asked to attend assessments in June and July at which they will be interviewed by an occupational psychologist. They will then be offered retraining in how to improve staff performance. The company surveyed about 3,500 of its 16,000 staff in one of the first schemes in Britain allowing staff to assess managers. Each was asked to fill in a questionnaire rating their managers' qualities. On scales of one to five, the 400 managers whose performance was assessed rated an average of 4.52 for being 'prepared to make decisions' but only 3.12 on being 'someone I could turn to if I have personal problems'. Mr John Ainley, W. H. Smith Retail's personnel and training manager, said the company had expected that managers would perform better in traditional roles because the company had trained them to do so in the past. He said: 'Those are the things we have concentrated on, and they are the traditional measures of a good manager, but we are now saying that a manager's job is broader than it was in the past and we are asking more from them.' The attributes on which the managers scored highest were: being prepared to make decisions, being able to maintain discipline, being courteous, providing advice when requested and delegating tasks when necessary. They were rated lowest as being someone 'to turn to if I have a personal problem'; 'who keeps me motivated'; 'is prepared to change his or her view if I have something useful to add'; and 'creates a happy working atmosphere'. The company is planning to repeat the survey in two years' time. BP Exploration, the BP subsidiary, has started implementing a similar scheme under which managers' performance is being rated by their subordinates.</p>

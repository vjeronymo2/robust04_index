			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Banks approve Eurotunnel funding plan Shares in Eurotunnel, the company which will operate the Channel tunnel, rose 20p to 630p yesterday on news that it had obtained approval from its banks to raise an extra Pounds 1bn in funding. The agreement reached with the company's 23 main banks clears the way for it to go ahead with detailed negotiations on a further Pounds 500m of bank loans and for a planned Pounds 500m rights issue. However, it does not automatically signify that the banking consortium will provide the loans. Details of which banks will provide the additional loans and the exact form the new lending will take have still to be negotiated though Eurotunnel said it already had a good idea where most of the money would come from. Under the agreement with the banking syndicate Eurotunnel will provide fresh security over revenues from its operating concession, recently extended from 55 to 65 years. Mr John Noulton, administration director, said: 'This represents a dilution of the banks' present security. It shows they are taking a judgment that the likely revenues are robust enough to provide sufficient security.' Approval for the increase in Eurotunnel's funding requirement from Pounds 9bn to Pounds 10bn will also lead to modifications in the credit agreement, including changes to the financial ratios which the company will have to meet. It described these as technical changes but said they would probably take until the end of February to sort out. The rights issue, which was given shareholder approval at the end of last month, is expected to take place between March and the official opening of the tunnel in May. See Lex</p>

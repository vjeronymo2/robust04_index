			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The advanced meat/bone separation machinery is currently in use in approximately 50 to 60 official establishments, all thought to be large firms. Product from such machinery is produced by several manufacturers using differing mechanisms, i.e., pressing, shaving, and scraping. An advanced meat/bone separation machine can process up to 400 beef carcasses an hour, yielding 3,500 to 4,000 pounds of product per hour. This calculates to 35 to 40 percent of meat from each carcass, about 1 to 11/2 pounds more per beef carcass than that produced under a hand-deboning operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Costs of Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It is estimated that the annual cost for operating one machine for beef is $170,000, which includes depreciation, repair, maintenance, labor, and compliance costs. The cost per head or per unit of output depends upon capacity utilization, labor costs, and other factors. The cost of such machinery is $60,000 to $80,000 per unit, and requires one person to operate each unit. The cost of compliance with the calcium content, as a measure of bone solids, is assumed to be about $5,000 per machine annually. This includes costs for testing for calcium content and required recordkeeping to support the validity of the calcium content. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Use of the machinery requires replacement of a $600 belt each 24 to 40 hours of operation. In addition, manufacturers indicate that an establishment producing 100 head of cattle per hour (400 head per hour for pork) is the minimum size necessary to justify use of such machinery. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To the extent that advanced meat/bone separation machinery is already in use, a portion of the costs have already been incurred by those establishments currently using such machinery. If such establishments choose to continue using the advanced meat/bone separation machinery, their only additional cost would be related to compliance with the calcium content requirement. Because this is a permissive rule, other establishments would incur the new costs associated with the use of such machinery if increased net returns are anticipated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Benefits of the Final Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The net benefits to the economy in the first year of implementation would be over $30 million, based on use of economic model for the U.S. livestock sector. It is estimated that annual net benefits would increase over time as the industry increases its use of this method which yields an additional 1 to 11/2 pounds of output per carcass. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While establishments that already use advanced technology or those that adopt the new technology immediately may enjoy high returns, the primary long-run benefits of adoption of advanced technology accrue to consumers of meat and stem from a net increase in meat supply through increased yield from each animal processed. Under pure competition, depending upon price elasticity of demand and supply, packer cost savings will be passed forward to consumers or backward to producers in the marketing chain. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

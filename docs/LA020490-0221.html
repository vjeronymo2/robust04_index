			<p><P> February 4, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COMMENTARY;  </P> <P> FOUR WAYS TO LOOK AT DEUKMEJIAN'S EMPLOYEE HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN  </P> <P> The Deukmejian Administration recently proposed a plan that would require every  business -- extending even to the self-employed -- to provide health insurance  to its workers. If implemented, the proposal would give California one of the  most ambitious state-mandated health insurance programs in the nation. The  Times asked four Orange County residents who are either knowledgeable about the  health-care field or who would have a vested interest in the implementation of  such an all-encompassing program to share their opinions -- positive and  negative -- about the proposal.  </P> <P> At least 5 million Californians are without health insurance; an unknown  additional number are underinsured. Although some of these people manage  without health care, the costs of caring for the rest are shifted to taxpayers  in a variety of ways. Other significant costs to society are lost productivity  and a drain on other social services as a result of lost earning power and  increased dependence by these families on government.  </P> <P> By addressing the issue of access to health care, the governor has joined those  of us who are working to find solutions. I applaud his initiative and think  this proposal is a move in the right direction. Focusing attention on the issue  is a necessary first step.  </P> <P> The proposal, by mandating business to provide health insurance to its  employees, will inject new dollars into a complicated "system." Past experience  teaches us that funds alone are not a solution, that these funds have tended to  lead to an upward spiral of health-care costs. It is not clear how costs will  be monitored and constrained while physicians and hospitals will be encouraged  to participate in Medi-Cal in increasing numbers.  </P> <P> Additional funding seems a necessary but not sufficient step toward universal  access to cost-effective care. Furthermore, a way to track utilization of these  new benefits to ensure that they are used appropriately will be needed.  </P> <P> A critical issue is the definition of what care these newly insured will have  access to. Who will set the priorities for these benefits, and by what  mechanisms? Agreement on what constitutes adequate or even basic benefits is  best achieved on a local or county level, rather than on a statewide basis. I  believe that the state should support local efforts to reach such consensus and  the counties should be assured their fair share of funding and freedom in the  administration of the governor's program.  </P> <P> The governor's desire to address the plight of the medically uninsured is most  welcome.  </P> <P> His proposal is neither comprehensive nor a panacea, but it deserves careful  study. The concept of a public-private partnership is increasingly accepted as  a means of creating innovative solutions to a "system" that has had too little  systematic planning to earn respect from those who are its consumers.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Berlin, Feb. 27 (YONHAP) -- A team of International  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) experts left for North Korea Sunday  afternoon to resume inspections halted nearly a year ago.    North Korea issued visas for the seven-man team through its  embassy in Vienna Saturday after a series of negotiations with  the United States on a compromise deal.    Pyongyang was to allow unrestricted IAEA access to its seven  declared facilities and hold working-level talks with Seoul on  an exchange of presidential envoys.    In return, Washington agreed to suspend this year's "Team  Spirit" military exercise held jointly with Seoul and to conduct  high-level talks with North Korea next month.    The IAEA inspectors will arrive in Beijing on Monday and  reach Pyongyang on Tuesday. They will spend about two weeks  checking the seven installations and another three to four weeks  producing inspection reports.    The last full-scale inspection in North Korea took place in  January last year. Checks since then have been restricted to  replacement of batteries and film in monitoring devices.</p>

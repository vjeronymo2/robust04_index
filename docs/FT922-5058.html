			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / Bright lights Beneath London's West End, fitter Steve Flint puts the finishing touches to a 132,000-volt cable tunnel leading to an electrical substation built to meet the growing demands of the capital's entertainment district. The first electricity from the complex built below Leicester Square (see inset drawing) will soon be fed to businesses and homes throughout the capital's theatreland. The project has taken several years and was designed to prevent traffic congestion in the heart of the West End and to protect the environment in neighbouring streets. Taylor Woodrow, the substation's contractor, has been commended by Westminster City Council. Work has been carried out while Leicester Square was refurbished by the council.</p>

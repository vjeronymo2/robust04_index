			<p>BFN     [Text] The Alex Boncayao Brigade (ABB), a communist hit  squad, is planning to bomb the offices of four big firms three  of which are government-owned, police said yesterday.    Director Ricaredo Sarmiento, chief of the Philippine  National  Police-National Capital Region Command (Capcom) placed all Metro  Manila police units on alert for possible attacks by the ABB.    Sarmiento identified the four ABB targets as the National  Power Corporation plant in Sucat, Paranaque; the main office of  the Manila Electric Co.; the Land Transportation Office in  Quezon City; and the Manila Waterways and Sewerage System Office  in Quezon City.    The disclosure of the plot came a day after police arrested  11 ABB supporters during a lightning rally in Makati .</p>

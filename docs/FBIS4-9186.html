			<p>BFN     [Text] Cajnice, April 21 (TANJUG) - With NATO aircraft  buzzing overhead, Moslems launched a violent artillery attack  from Gorazde on Bosnian Serb positions on the right bank of the  Drina river on Thursday [21 April] afternoon. Three Serb  soldiers were wounded in the shelling, which has set fire to a  large tract of forest, two kilometres south of gorazde, the  local command of the Bosnian Serb Army has said. The Moslems  were again using schools, hospitals and residential buildings  for their operations against the Serbs, the Serb Army command  said. The Moslem media have alleged that the Serbs are  attacking these locations, and the falsehood has been picked up  by many world media.    Bosnian Serbs on Wednesday unilaterally declared a ceasefire  and agreed to the deployment of two platoons of U.N.  peacekeepers in the area, in line with an agreement struck with  U.N. officials on Tuesday. The Moslems have once again spurned  the peace offering and are continuing to attack. Moslems are  continuing to attack Bosnian Serb positions on other fronts in  Bosnia as well, and are bring in reinforcements to Brcko in the  north, which they are keeping under constant artillery fire.    In the Doboj area, also in the north, the worst Moslem  attacks have been from small arms, hand grenades and mortars at  Teslic. Bosnian Serb positions at Teslic, south of Doboj, have  come under a steady stream of mortar fire, eliciting a response  in kind, which has effectively put an end to the Moslem  operations. Moslems were also opening small-arms and sniper  fire at the Serbs on the Trebava front, east of Doboj, Bosnian  Serb sources reported.</p>

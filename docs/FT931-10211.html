			<p>930210 FT  10 FEB 93 / Brussels puts the brakes on motorbikes A EUROPEAN Commission draft directive, which effectively dictates to motorcycle manufacturers the detailed design of their engines, and even the type and quality of metals they may use for some components, is causing an outcry throughout the industry and among user groups. The directive, so detailed that it specifies such engineering parameters as gasket thicknesses, inlet port design and ignition system operation, is intended to prevent owners 'tuning' their machines to obtain more power. But it would have an impact, with as yet unforeseen effects, on the design, development, marketing and other commercial fortunes of all manufacturers seeking to sell their machines in the EC. Motorcycle industry and user groups, now lobbying fiercely against its adoption, insist that Brussels bureaucrats are exceeding their competence. Mr Graham Sanderson, spokesman for the British Motorcyclists' Federation, said: 'It graphically illustrates why so many European citizens are concerned about the Maastricht treaty and the further ceding of power to the Commission.' The required technical specifications for engine manufacture make up an addendum of six closely-typed pages. Mr Sanderson's remarks came as the European parliament was resuming the first reading of another motorcycle-related bill, under which the Commission is seeking to adopt a directive restricting motorcycles to no more than 100 brake horsepower. If adopted, this would prohibit the sale in EC markets of the more powerful machines produced by some European manufacturers, as well as the big Japanese makers, Honda, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki who dominate the world's motor cycle markets. In the case of Triumph, the reborn UK motor cycle manufacturer currently expecting to produce nearly 7,000 motorcycles this year, five of its eight models would become illegal within the EC. The Commission is pushing for the adoption of both directives on the grounds that they would improve the generally poor safety record of motorcycles and mopeds. The 100 brake horsepower directive has already hit opposition in the European parliament, whose economic and industry policy committee has already rejected it once. The 'anti-tampering' directive has yet to reach the parliament but is expected to do so within the next few weeks.</p>

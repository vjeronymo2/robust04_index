			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / People: Premier position for Barrie Stephens Premier Consolidated Oilfields has come up with a high-profile replacement for Roland Shaw, the controversial founder of the independent oil and gas exploration company who was ousted in August. He is Barrie Stephens, the 66-year-old Welshman who has built Siebe, the international controls group, into one of the UK's biggest engineering companies. During his 31 years at Siebe, sales have grown from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.86bn and the Windsor-based group now employs 32,000 people worldwide. Stephens combined the roles of chairman and chief executive at Siebe until the begining of this year, and still works three days a week as chairman. He became a non-executive director of Simon Engineering last year. Roland Shaw, Premier's colourful founder, was forced out in a boardroom coup at the age of 72. Shaw, who came to London from Dallas in the 1960s, is well known in the oil industry for his outspoken views and strong personality. The archetypal deal-maker, Shaw is widely credited with building up Premier from scratch to a company that at the peak of the oil market was worth Pounds 500m, compared with its present value of Pounds 142m. However, his flamboyant approach sat uneasily with the other members of Premier's board when conditions in the oil industry were more sober. He was stripped of his executive position in 1992 and quit as non-executive chairman in August. Shaw remains chairman of Heritage Oil and Gas. According to Charles Jamieson, Premier's chief executive, Stephens has contacts not only in the City, but in the international business community where Premier is expanding its operations.</p>

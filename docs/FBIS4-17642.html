			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Vadim Byrkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 23 April TASS -- The position of the Black  Sea Fleet commanders fully coincides with that of the Russian  delegation to the talks on gradual settlement of the Black Sea  Fleet dispute, First Deputy Commander of the Black Sea Fleet  Vitaliy Larionov said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Saturday, Larionov said  that number one problem is the location of the Black Sea Fleet  and the Ukrainian Navy. He accused the Ukrainian side of shying  away from this issue and concentrating instead on the division  of the fleet.    Ukraine believes that both forces should stay in Sevastopol  and rules out other variants. But the Black Sea Fleet includes,  apart from ships, land infrastructure, aviation, coastal guards,  engineering systems and other facilities.    The Russian delegation showed patience and willingness to  find a common ground at the talks. But after Ukraine refused to  discuss the location of the Black Sea Fleet and the Ukrainian  Navy and sign a protocol of disagreements the Russian side had  to suspend negotiations.    Larionov believes, however, that there is still a chance of  resolving the dispute. He called on both sides to take a  responsible approach and work out a constructive position.</p>

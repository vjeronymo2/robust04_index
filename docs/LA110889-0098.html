			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> HOW DISPUTE AFFECTED INVESTORS  </P> <P> The government's debt ceiling problem caused concern among owners of Treasury  bills and other government securities, but investors had nothing to fear.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco received  double the normal number of telephone calls after Congress' failure to pass  legislation to raise the federal debt limit, said Ted Schroeder, assistant vice  president in charge of marketable securities, savings bonds and Treasury  accounts. Congress finally raised the government's borrowing authority late  Tuesday.  </P> <P> During that period, the Treasury had suspended sales of savings bonds, Treasury  bills and other securities, leaving some investors worried if they could redeem  securities they already held. But all securities were redeemed as normal, and  interest rates and payments were not affected, Schroeder said.  </P> <P> However, the sales suspension did affect Treasury bills that were maturing and  were due to be automatically reinvested by the government. Federal Reserve  banks held the funds for these maturing securities and were not paying interest  for the few days the money sat idle, Schroeder said. But investors could  request their money and reinvest it themselves somewhere else, he said. NANCY  RIVERA BROOKS  </P></p>

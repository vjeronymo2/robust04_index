			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / BR aims for 3,000 strike-breaking trains Railtrack will today make its most concerted effort yet to break the signalling strike, with 3,000 trains running - about 50 per cent more than during the last one-day strike a week ago. The strike will be the fifth consecutive Wednesday stoppage in an increasingly bitter dispute. RMT, the transport union, meets tomorrow to consider stepping up action after talks called to settle the dispute failed early on Tuesday. Railtrack is confident it can position its small number of working signalmen where they will have the greatest impact. It believes that in some areas it will in effect break the strike. The company, responsible for track, signals and stations, has tried to press every supervisor and manager into operating signal boxes. That may enable British Rail to run a fifth of its normal weekday services. Trains expected to run today which did not run last Wednesday include the InterCity express services between Euston and Birmingham International and suburban services from Woking and Hampton Court to Waterloo. Other strike-breaking services will include commuter trains on north Merseyside, between Liverpool and Southport; between Bristol and Salisbury; and in north Wales from Llandudno to Blaenau Ffestiniog. A Railtrack executive said: 'The strike is pretty well broken in some parts of the country, though it is rock solid in others.' BR believes there is little scope for further services if the stoppage continues. RMT blamed government interference for the collapse of negotiations. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the union's general secretary, suggested that Railtrack, wholly owned by the government, was still not free to negotiate with the RMT on past productivity. Mr Knapp said: 'The real difference between the two sides is not great. But the government has to take the arm-lock off Railtrack's negotiators and let them conclude a deal which they think is in the best interests of the industry - not the political interests of the government. 'This dispute is only complex and intractable because the government has made it so,' he added. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, confirmed yesterday to the House of Commons employment committee that he had made clear to Railtrack that it must negotiate with the signalling staff inside the guidelines of the government's public sector pay freeze policy.

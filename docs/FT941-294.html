			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Survey of Japanese Financial Markets (7): Firms switch staff to Hong Kong - Foreign Institutions For the foreign financial institutions which flock to Tokyo, the city is still a key financial centre, at the heart of the world's second-largest economy. But Tokyo is losing its status as a base for the entire Asia Pacific region. Even five years ago, it would have been unheard of for a large foreign institution to set up its Asian headquarters anywhere but Tokyo. The standard split was to divide the world into three main regions: North America, Europe (including the Middle East and sometimes Africa) and Asia. The development of business in emerging markets in the past few years has changed that view of the world. At the same time that business in Asia's emerging markets was becoming increasingly profitable, the Japanese market turned. The collapse of the stock market, the slide into economic recession and the relative isolation of Japan from the rest of Asia began to make Tokyo seem a less obvious choice as Asian headquarters. Hong Kong was the most obvious rival for the title. At the time, rents were cheaper and salaries and taxes lower, and many banks and securities houses started to shift staff from Japan to Hong Kong - or at least to build up staff in Hong Kong rather than Tokyo. This process has accelerated in the past year, even though Hong Kong's costs have now caught up with Tokyo. Salomon Brothers, for example, has just created an Asia Pacific group which excludes Japan. One banker estimates that the number of staff in Hong Kong employed by US firms has doubled in the past year or two, while numbers in Tokyo are static or falling. Salomon currently employs 500 staff in Tokyo; 60 fewer than a year ago. Merrill Lynch also has a staff of 500; down 100 after running down its private client business, although its institutional business is growing. But Merrill's Hong Kong staff base has trebled in the last year. There has also been a build-up of staff in Singapore, which many banks view as a back-up, in case things go wrong in Hong Kong when the Chinese take over in 1997. Some bankers feel that the greatest threat to Tokyo could ultimately come from Shanghai, where they think the Chinese may try to set up a new financial centre for Asia. Back in Tokyo, different groups of foreign institutions have tended to focus on different areas of business. While the UK houses entered the brokerage side of the market, the largest players in the Japanese market are the US houses, which came in on the bond side of the business but have tried to build up a broad capital markets base, incorporating foreign exchange, corporate finance and derivatives. The US firms which at first concentrated on proprietary or programme trading, such as Salomon Brothers and Morgan Stanley, have now moved into broader capital markets business. In the past few years, there has been a shift from equities to bond business, reflecting the depressed state of the Japanese stock market, and the bull market for bonds in 1992 and 1993. 'Given what happened in the equity market, there has been a noticeable shift in investor demand from equities to bonds,' said Mr Louis Faust, branch manager of Salomon which has made 'some selective additions in fixed income,' while introducing a voluntary retirement programme in the equity support group. Some areas of business - particularly underwriting - have proved, not surprisingly, difficult to break into. Most foreign institutions say they are not trying to compete for domestic underwriting business, but that, for example, a US house should be able to win mandates to bring Japanese companies to the US market. 'We are not trying to compete with domestic institutions on their own turf, but where there is a cross-border advantage or smart technology,' said Mr Richard Dunn, managing director of Merrill Lynch in Japan.' The big Swiss banks, while lagging behind the largest US houses, have also built up sizeable operations, and are also active in the trust business. Other firms have built up businesses in niche areas, for example Societe Generale in derivatives. Meanwhile, conventional stockbroking has proved an extremely difficult area, for domestic as well as foreign institutions. NatWest is so far the only foreign stockbroker to give up its membership on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (in 1992), which it obtained in 1988 after pressure had been put on the Japanese authorities by the UK government. NatWest is now trying to rebuild its position, concentrating on the fixed income side of the business. Other UK banks, mainly the merchant banks, continue to concentrate on mainstream stockbroking business, but many have been forced to cut staff. Baring Securities cut back in 1992 because of the reduction in share volume from about Dollars 2bn a day in 1989 to about Dollars 200m, and has been building up its emerging market business. 'There has been a net transfer of staff out of Japan to elsewhere in Asia - about 30-40 people in the past two years,' said Mr Diarmaid Kelly, deputy chairman of Baring Securities. Tokyo staff has dropped from 245 to 190. However, he believes that in time the Japanese operation will benefit from the growth in Baring's emerging market expertise. 'The Japanese haven't invested a great deal in emerging markets or foreign equities yet, but that is coming, as night follows day.' He argues that Japanese companies have invested huge amounts in businesses in Asia in the past few years and that is bound to be followed by investment by investors. For the moment, although the basic business of the foreign brokerage firms in Japan is selling Japanese shares to European clients, or less frequently European shares to Japanese clients. If predictions of an upturn in the Japanese equity market are realised, Japanese equity volume could also be set to increase. Some analysts are already predicting that Japanese investors will shift from bonds to equities at the start of their new financial year in April.</p>

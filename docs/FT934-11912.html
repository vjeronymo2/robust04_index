			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / Russians recall 76-year pledge THE daily Izvestiya yesterday heralded its announcement of President Boris Yeltsin's decree giving Russian citizens the right to buy, sell, rent and bequeath land by reprinting its own front page of exactly 76 years ago. That contained the decree 'On Land' by the new Bolshevik government which proclaimed that land would be returned to the peasants. The reality, said Izvestiya yesterday, soon became one of state ownership and dispossession of peasant proprietors in favour of collectivisation. The present decree sets out, for the first time in Russian history, to create a class of farmer-proprietors with fully guaranteed rights. The state will guarantee and protect the right to buy, sell, rent, transfer and divide land freely, reserving only the right to claim land for strategic state use after paying the market price for it. Foreigners and foreign companies can participate in the process of buying and selling land, but apparently only (the decree is vague on the point) in association with Russian companies. Land can be used for agricultural purposes, or for development of any kind. In a move analagous to the rights given to workers in state enterprises, workers on state and collective farms will have the right to buy plots of land at discounted prices. Land can be sold off in auctions or offered for sale privately to competitive bids. A new state body, with offices in all regions, will be charged with ensuring that land sales go through.</p>

			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH;  </P> <P> COUNCIL MEMBERS DOUBLE OWN PAY  </P> <P> Laguna Beach council members voted unanimously this week to double their  monthly paychecks from $150 to $300.  </P> <P> The pay raise, scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, was proposed by Councilman Dan  Kenney, who is not seeking reelection in November.  </P> <P> "The last time the City Council got a raise was in 1965. I figured it was  probably not so bad if I brought it forward," Kenney said Tuesday before the  council's vote.  </P> <P> "It's really just an indication of the amount of work we put in," he said.  </P> <P> After taxes and other payroll deductions, Kenney said, council members  currently take home $69.23 every two weeks.  </P> <P> The state Government Code states that in cities with a population of less than  35,000, councils can approve salaries up to $300 per month. Subsequent pay  hikes may not exceed 5% each year.  </P> <P> All Orange County cities except one in that population category already pay  their council members at least $300 per month. The exception is Villa Park,  population 6,950, which does not pay its council members.  </P></p>

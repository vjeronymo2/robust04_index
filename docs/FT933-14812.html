			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Nigerian president orders fresh poll NIGERIA faces another presidential election after an announcement late last night that there could, after all, be no interim government to replace the military regime on August 27. This latest twist to President Ibrahim Babangida's six-year transition to democracy follows his annulment of last month's presidential polls, which were the first for a decade. Although the polls were widely regarded as peaceful and fair, the military government claimed that the elections were flawed and that the winning candidate, Mr Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), was unfit to hold office. The statement read last night by Information Minister Uche Chukwumerije leaves Nigeria's political future as unclear as at any stage in the lengthy transition to democracy. The president decided to press ahead with new elections on July 31 after the country's two political parties failed to agree on his proposals to set up an interim government and to hand over power to an unelected civilian president. President Babangida issued his order after meeting a group of his generals and leaders of the two parties. Mr Abiola's Social Democrats stormed out of the meeting. The SDP has already ruled out fresh elections under the military regime, claiming that they would have no credibility and that its candidate's victory on June 12 should be officially recognised. Mr Abiola has declared himself president-elect and will oppose any movement within the SDP to take part in fresh polls. Mr Abiola is a member of the Yoruba tribe, and many Nigerians believe that the country's generals, dominated by the Hausa, are implacably opposed to allowing him to be sworn in as president.</p>

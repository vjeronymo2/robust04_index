			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Arts: An Inspector Calls - Lyttelton Theatre Good news from the Royal National Theatre: Stephen Daldry turns out to be quite as effective working on a large stage as he was on a small. Daldry was until recently artistic director at the tiny Gate Theatre in London's Notting Hill and is about to take up a similar post at the Royal Court. He was invited to direct at the National while in transit. Who would have guessed that he would come up with An Inspector Calls to display his talents? J B Priestley's play is an impeccable example of really good middle-brow drama: full of craftsmanship, the odd surprise and several good parts. On the intellectual level, it raises questions without being in the least bit provocative or shocking. It is the sort of stuff of which the Reithian BBC was made. For an audience, it is almost impossible not to sit back and enjoy it. In other words, this is not what we expect from Daldry, although a programme note reveals that he has directed the play before at the Theatre Royal in York. What he shows at the National is that even a conventional piece can be successfully subjected to his staging techniques. An Inspector is essentially a dining room thriller with psychological and social insights. The inspector arrives at an engagement party of north country industrialists - the Birlings of Brumley - gradually to uncover all sorts of skeletons in the cupboard. No member of the Birling family has behaved criminally; social responsibility to the unseen girl who is alleged to have committed suicide is another matter. One way of playing this would be to give the whole stage to the dining room and let the action revolve around the table. Indeed, by all accounts, that is how An Inspector was played at its first London production in 1946, starring Ralph Richardson, Alec Guinness and Margaret Leighton. Daldry has different and better ideas. On a small scale. the entire Birling house is centre stage, but it is the shell from which the family is drawn out rather than where the action takes place. The rest of the stage is a kind of no-man's land. Another house can be seen in the background, a line of lamp-posts stretching towards it. A full-scale red telephone box, quite important to the plot, is in the corner of front stage right. It is the no-man's land that is dominant and where the inspector pursues his inquiries and, one by one, members of the family admit to past actions that do not bear too close a scrutiny. This is the outside world looking in rather than the family protecting itself behind comfortably closed curtains. Daldry has made one other change. Although the play was written towards the end of the second world war, it is set towards the beginning of the first. Daldry has switched the action to 1945. I do not think that the change makes a ha'p'orth of significant difference. Priestley's work stands up for any period. But it does allow the use of a crowd scene. From time to time, the Labour voters of 1945 - not all them by any means in cloth caps - silently occupy the stage and, at the end, the Birlings' house. There is also a coup de theatre. At one stage, the house falls down, dining room and all. Nothing put on by Daldry is ever dull, and as a designer he has Ian MacNeil who worked with him at the Gate. Kenneth Cranham is the inspector, the role once played by Alec Guinness. As a part, it has grown with time, for nowadays we tend to give more sympathy to the outsider than to the bourgeois family. Cranham plays it perfectly, without undue aggression. The rest of the acting struck me as a bit flat, though I admired Diana Kent as the daughter who sees the political light. In repertory at the Lyttelton Theatre (071 928 2252) until October 20, then touring.</p>

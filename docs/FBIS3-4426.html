Already trailing behind other parts of  the country in the pace of economic growth, the province has  also complained of the dearth of financial backing from the  central Government and increased burden under the new tax  reforms. The grievances dominated a group discussion by Shaanxi  deputies of the Government Work Report at the Great Hall of the  People yesterday.    Speaking after hearing the complaints, Shaanxi Governor Bai  Qingcai lent weight to the central policy, however. "We still  support the policy of the central Government to boost its  financial strength. It will be helpful to the less economically  developed regions," he said. "Growth is a matter of time. The  coastal regions have started earlier but we will be able to  catch up. We are parts and the state is whole. We have to  position ourself in the whole and to give a full play to our own  potential," the Governor said. Mr Bai also stressed that the  overall situation in the province was stable. "Some people  might have their own grievances and take it to the  Government.... Some also suffered from the delay of payment of  their wages. We have already urged all localities to pay  attention to the problem," he said.    The Mayor of Xian, the capital city of Shaanxi, Cui Litao,  has warned that several factors have increased the possibility  of social unrest in the city this year, including the prospect  of prices going beyond levels that workers can bear. Although  last year's annual inflation of 12.7 percent was lower than in  the coastal regions and major cities, Mr Cui said price controls  should be strengthened as market economic reform deepened. "If  we can keep good control over prices there should be no major  problems this year," he said. The mayor also pointed to factors  such as deteriorating law and order, corruption and delays and  failure to pay wages and pensions to workers in some  money-losing enterprises. "Together with civil disputes, they  are elements that might cause instability," Mr Cui said. He  said many people had complained that the public security body  was "in a mess". He admitted a few public security officers  were corrupt, but said the police force was sound as a whole.    Pang Jiayu, head of the large city of Baoji, cast doubt on  whether the Government would be able to keep inflation down to  10 per cent. "We must ensure the adequate supply of  commodities. Otherwise, it will create major conflicts," he  said. He said conflicts among religious sects in the province  might also create further disturbances.    Another delegate from Xian, Yu Xiaowen, said the province  could not rely on its own funds entirely and needed money from  the central Government. "If stability in Shaanxi cannot be  maintained, it will affect the whole northwestern region," she  said.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Observer: Sending for Mr Major Does President Francois Mitterrand really know what he is doing in attempting to enlist John Major's help for his own faltering pro-Maastricht campaign? Asking Britain's prime minister to appear on French TV ahead of next month's referendum could be another sign of the old fox's astute political cunning. But then again, it could be an indication that the 75-year-old president is simply losing his touch. Major does, it is true, tend to sound a lot more persuasive on the virtues of Maastricht when translated into French. His eloquent support for the treaty in his interview in Le Monde a couple of months ago - Je l'ai negocie], j'y crois] - sounded a great deal more fulsome than anything before. On the other hand, the intervention of a politician from perfidious Albion in French domestic politics might make many French voters suspicious of some sort of outre-Manche plot against French interests. Similarly, yesterday's announcement by Mitterrand's arch-enemy Jacques Chirac, the leader of the neo-Gaullist opposition, that he will aid the 'Yes' campaign may have sent a frisson through the Elysee palace. Perhaps Mitterrand would be well advised to rely on the support simply of Chancellor Helmut Kohl - who has so many problems of his own that he clearly cannot afford to meddle beyond his borders.</p>

			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Architecture: Central Chelsea oasis - A look at a brave new house from Anthony Collett One of the rarest things to find in Britain at the moment is a newly-built, architect-designed house. It is one of the tragedies of architectural life in the UK that so few people build themselves a new house. There are various reasons for this. The difficulty of finding a site, especially in or around a major city; the endless and irksome planning regulations that are enough to deter a potential builder; and the inclination to buy the implied social status that comes with an old house when new money is made. The lure of the old is a very real problem in the UK. When you make money in the US, Germany or Japan, the natural thing to do to build a new house. This is wonderful for architects and very good for the progress of architecture. Houses are the natural place for architectural expression and for that fusion of ideas between client and architect. In London recently I was excited to be shown an exceptional new house in an unexpected place - a very central site in Chelsea. Architects Anthony Collett and Associates, working closely with the developers Toyoko Metropolitan Company, took on the conversion of Chelsea Old Rectory into a luxurious London house and as part of the development was able to build a new house on a long, thin site between the rectory garden and the Kings Road. Initially it must have seemed a very unpromising site - between the backs of the shops and the rectory garden. Any estate agent would probably have recommended that a routine development of mews houses was the best option. Luckily Collett came along, an architect with imaginative and practical ideas. He saw the potential for one remarkable house. He and his development partners succeeded in breaking the mould by not following estate agents advice and took a speculative risk by designing a significant single house to a very high and original architectural standard. It is unusual in that the major part of the house extends right to the external boundaries of the whole long, narrow site. This not only produced the largest floor area possible for the house, it also gave the architect the opportunity to include in the plan three internal courtyards. This gives the house the atmosphere of a Roman atrium house but the architectural style does not ape classicism - it is its own clear, modern and yet characterful idiom. From the street you see very little, two gates in the wall - one leading through the garden to the front door, and the other to the garage. The first surprise is the formality of the white entrance facade with its small dome and very tall copper clad door. Once you are inside the reason for the dome becomes clear. It provides dramatic top light for the circular entrance hall and certainly imparts a sense of scale and dignity to the building's entrance. It is light that is the key to the success of this house. It is brought in through the courtyards and the skilful use of top light in the corridor and double height volume of the drawing room. Both the dining room and the drawing room look on to the first and largest courtyard garden - which in summer is really a third reception room as it is completely private and enclosed. These major entertaining rooms have a cool elegance about them with their understated detailing and variety of scale. The house would suit a collector of modern art as it would respond well to large-scale paintings and sculpture. At the heart of the house is a small study and library, where Anthony Collett shows the advantages of being an architect who is also an experienced interior and furniture designer. The library is panelled in timber and has a simple modern, green marble fireplace - everything is simply detailed, while retaining a sense of tradition in the use of good materials. This sense of solid materials and clear design continues around the second courtyard area, which is the garden for the indoor swimming pool. The pool, although indoors, opens into the courtyard and is lit by a large glass skylight, which encourages a sense of being almost outdoors as you can swim and look up at the sky. The floor of the 8 1/2 metre long pool is tiled in a chequer-board pattern, with granite steps leading down into the water. The third element of the house has a very different character to the lean and elegant entertaining rooms. It is a two-storey pavilion built around another garden and linked by an interesting staircase to the rest of the house. This is the private realm - guest bedrooms and, on the first floor, a complete family suite that feels entirely self contained. This has the best views over the newly-planned rectory garden, which is one of the largest private gardens in London. While this is clearly a luxurious house, that needs its separate zones for services and staff, it has many architectural lessons for urban living. It demonstrates the virtue of the courtyard plan for allowing both privacy and outdoor space on a confined site. Stylistically Collett and Associates shows it is possible to provide a sense of elegance and great material comfort by using modern design and excellent materials. Collett's catholic approach to design allows the drama of the domed entrance hall and the coolness of the simple high reception rooms. The use of this oddly shaped pocket of urban land also demonstrates that it is possible to develop imaginatively in the inner city - in a way that allows for civilised private life in an elegant setting and architectural achievement of a high degree.</p>

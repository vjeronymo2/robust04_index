			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANCE REVIEW;  </P> <P> ABT CAST CHANGES HAVE MIXED RESULTS  </P> <P> As result of injury and substitution, the pair of star-cross'd lovers  originally announced for the American Ballet Theatre performance of "Romeo and  Juliet" on Thursday danced one day early at the Orange County Performing Arts  Center.  </P> <P> Marianna Tcherkassky made a lyric, sweet Juliet who revealed unexpected  dramatic depths and strengths in the later scenes. John Gardner, in his first  casting as Romeo, drew only the outline of a dramatic character but proved a  secure and considerate partner.  </P> <P> While never a dancer who relied upon technique to dazzle, Tcherkassky  compensated with purity of line and sincerity of emotion. For her, love at  first sight meant a deeply felt pain that later turned impetuous and wild.  </P> <P> Opposite that intensity, Gardner portrayed a genial, warm but self-effacing  Romeo. He has yet to inhabit the role. He danced with careful, underpowered  virtuosity.  </P> <P> Gil Boggs provided a wry, bemused Mercutio, pre-eminent among his friends in  clear shape, vigor and non-stop momentum, and wrenching in his death scene.  </P> <P> But Ross Yearsley was only a sketchy, untidy Benvolio.  </P> <P> Ethan Brown made Tybalt the bully of Verona and, like a textbook bully, reacted  with fear when he actually committed an act of violence -- in this case,  killing Mercutio by accident. The moment relieved an otherwise oppressive  single-note interpretation but passed all too quickly.  </P> <P> Christine Dunham ventured an intriguing, atypical Rosaline, a woman who seemed  not altogether indifferent toward Romeo. If only he hadn't caught sight of that  other woman at the ball?  </P> <P> In two cases, casting became almost prodigal: the authoritative Martine van  Hamel as a determined and sympathetic Lady Capulet, and the virtuosic, airborne  Johan Renvall ennobling the cameo solo duties in the Mandolin Dance.  </P> <P> Jack Everly again conducted.  </P> <P>  The American Ballet Theatre continues through Sunday at the Orange County  Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Tickets: $10 to $40.  Information: (714) 556-2787.  </P> <P> </P></p>

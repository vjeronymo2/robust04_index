			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Japan and the United States  are likely to postpone concluding until September automobile and  parts talks, one of three priority areas in bilateral  "framework" trade negotiations, Japanese Government sources said  Wednesday.    The two countries, however, are likely to agree on Japanese  Government procurement and insurance industry reforms by the  time Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata and President Bill Clinton meet  in Naples, they said.    The two state leaders are scheduled to meet in Naples for  the  annual summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G-7) leading  industrial nations which is to be held July 8-10.    "Japan wants to make further efforts and create a better  atmosphere by then to make the U.S. side feel hopeful in  concluding the automotive negotiations in September," the  sources said.    As for Japan's macroeconomic policies, another focal point  in  the series of talks to create a new framework for bilateral  trade, the sources said negotiations look likely to take more  time.    They added, however, Japan will accelerate its efforts to  bring in line domestic opinions on such macroeconomic aspects as  tax reforms and increasing public works investment, with one  source saying Hata needs to show Japan's basic plan to Clinton.</p>

			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Word on the street I HAD dinner in Mayfair this week with my friend Wayne Talent. Both of us have street cred, and both like a bet, so our conversation ranged freely from today's Grand National to the UK election; from life in the universe to who was in charge of things before Big Bang, with its concomitant invention of maths, physics, art, literature and the bullets that conspired and flew that mad day in Dallas. Wayne is the younger brother of Keith Talent, the Notting Hill racketeer of Martin Amis's novel, London Fields. Wayne claims never to have heard of Martin Amis and his works. But he keeps in touch with Keith, currently in prison, whose latest conviction for robbery is now regarded, by Keith's solicitor, as unsatisfactory, given the fibs with which the police evidence was contaminated. Unlike Keith, Wayne never cheats, steals or bashes. He is a gentleman, a friend of Dorothy's: 28-ish, gaunt, plausible, capped - and rich, a child of Thatcherism. So rich that, like all the rich I know, Wayne is genuinely untroubled whether Labour wins the UK election or not. 'Stands to reason, dunnit, Mike?' said Wayne this week. 'Tories. Labour. Paddy Ashdown. What's the difference? They're all high taxers, all high spenders. The only difference between them, Mike, is 175 Footsie points, maybe 200 - peanuts, cashew nuts. Know what I mean? Have a crab claw.' Wayne explained that what he needed guidance on was today's Grand National steeplechase at Aintree, regarded by its admirers as one of the sporting world's great spectacles, but by me as immoral. 'I know you don't like the race, Mike. Regard it as a bloodbath, akin to torturing bears. But I can't resist Cool Ground, even though he's favourite. I'm thinking of betting 15 thou, maybe even 20. What's your considered? Street guy like you.' I studied Wayne closely. His caps glittered polar bright. His hair-cuts cost Pounds 100. If Wayne was planning to plunge on a runner in the Grand National, I needed to disabuse him. 'You have got to reconsider, Wayne. The Grand National kills horses, but it is also a graveyard for punters like you. Forget Cool Ground. The reason you want to back him is that he won the Cheltenham Gold Cup three weeks ago and thus stands a chance of emulating Golden Miller's unique feat in 1934 when winning the Gold Cup and Grand National in the same season. 'But look what happened to the others that tried the same trick. In 1925, Ballinode fell; a year later, Koko fell; in 1927, Thrown In fell; two years later, Easter Hero was 2nd; in 1933, Golden Miller fell, though he won it the following year; in 1935, Golden Miller unseated his rider; the year after that, Golden Miller - again - was brought down and refused to jump a fence; 1939: Brendan's Cottage fell; 1946: Prince Regent was 3rd; 1977: Davy Lad fell; 1979: Alverton - a lovely horse - smashed his neck and was killed at Becher's Brook; 1991: Garrison Savannah was 2nd. 'Whatever you do, Wayne, give Cool Ground a miss. Just hope he's alive on Sunday. If you want my advice, put Pounds 500 each way on Willsford and leave it at that.' Wayne was disappointed. 'I want to bet big, Mike. What about Margaret Thatcher? I see that William Hill is offering 25-1 against her regaining the Tory party leadership before the end of the century. Think that's a goer? Street guy like you.' 'No, I don't, Wayne', I said. 'I was struck, this week, by something Ivan Straker said in the Racing Post. Straker is the non-executive chairman of Seagram UK, which sponsors the Grand National . . . ' ' . . . I bet he hates your guts . . . ' ' . . . I imagine that is true. But he redeemed himself slightly by saying that under Maggie Thatcher, greed and envy prospered. And then he said: 'There are two sets of values in the world - material and human - and I accept you can't live without them both. But take away the human values of trust, loyalty, sympathy, understanding, honesty, and you aren't worth a bugger'. That is what he said. And Straker is a Tory, albeit a pink one. Forget Margaret Thatcher, Wayne.' 'But I want to have a bet. Something really sexy.' 'All right', I said. 'Ring Paul Austin at Ladbroke, who is calculating some odds for me against the confirmation of intelligent life elsewhere in the galaxy. Could be very tasty. Take anything he quotes you. I recently visited Nasa. Do I have to spell it out?'</p>

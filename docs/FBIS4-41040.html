			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Business News Weekly" feature No. 25 , 13-19 Jun </F> 94]    [Text] Over 1994's five months, two-thirds of the planned  revenues were remitted to the state budget, the then acting  Premier Yefim Zvyagilski stated in his speech in the Ukrainian  parliament on 14 June.    The cash gap between the planned revenues and budgetary  expenditures in 1994's 1st quarter amounted to almost 40  trillion karbovantsi [K].    NBU [National Bank of Ukraine] granted 26.6 trillion  [currency not specified] credits to bridge it.    Considering the latter circumstance, expenditures amounted  to  K145 trillion (67 per cent).    82.8 per cent of budgetary outlays were channelled to  welfare  and support for societal, cultural, educational and other  state-financed institutions related to the societal domain.    According to Mr. Zvyagilski, reduced revenues resulted from  not only objective causes, but because of "certain ministers and  departments having failed to take adequate moves to mobilize  revenues for the state budget, as provided for by the Law."    In the meantime, Vitali Masol, the newly appointed prime  minister of Ukraine, said in his inaugural speech in the  Ukrainian parliament that, according to IMF experts, about 1.3  billion US dollars hard currency incomings had failed to return  to Ukraine in 1993.</p>

			<p>920808 FT  08 AUG 92 / Balkan minefield for the west: Pressure is mounting for some form of military intervention to support the Yugoslav relief effort Over the past week, television pictures of detention camps, the forcible deportation of Bosnian Moslems, the killing of orphans, and the mortar attack at a funeral in Sarajevo have shocked people throughout Europe and the US. Increasingly, public opinion - as well as political parties in European capitals and in Washington - is demanding that the international community take measures to stop the fighting and killing in Bosnia-Hercegovina. A year ago, when the Yugoslav federal army and Serb nationalists started attacking Croatia, western governments condemned the fighting. But they sought a solution through the offices of the European Community, which they hoped would help negotiate a settlement to the conflict. Public opinion now believes that the EC's mediating efforts have been a failure. Western governments are being called upon to do something. But if action involves some form of military intervention, the questions are, how, where, and for what aim? Many EC countries - including Britain, France and Italy - and the US, however reluctantly, are prepared to send in aircraft (France might even provide troops) to protect the international humanitarian aid effort currently being led by the UN, but only with backing from the Security Council. They recognise that even that commitment carries high risks. Mr Michael Clarke, head of the Centre for Defence Studies at Kings College, London, said the military manpower needed to protect a massive humanitarian effort should not be underestimated. 'If we are talking about opening up two land corridors, in eastern and western Bosnia, these would have to be manned by three or four divisions. That's about 60,000 ground troops. I am not so sure there is the political will to commit such levels of manpower. If these troops were attacked, they would have to defend themselves,' he said. The US and Britain are determined not to go beyond supplying aircraft to any UN-backed relief effort. 'We cannot go beyond providing air back-up for the humanitarian relief operation,' said a staff member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington. 'Let me also mention that we will stick only to supporting a humanitarian effort. The point is that if we use aircraft to bomb Serb artillery units on the hills around Sarajevo, we will be effectively declaring war on Serbia. Do we really want to do that?' he asked. 'And if that were to happen, would civil war break out in Serbia? There are no easy options or solutions.' Despite the acknowledged problems inherent in military intervention, pressure for western countries to become involved appears to be increasing. 'I say, and very reluctantly so, that the consequences of non-involvement in Bosnia are worse than the dangers of involvement,' said Mr Clarke. 'But we have to be clear what our goal is.' This is the nub of the problem. The US, the EC, the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe and UN diplomats in New York have so far failed to identify what they want to achieve by deploying any form of military force in Bosnia. Some UN officials and defence experts on the ground in Bosnia believe - in the short term at least - that military intervention should have two aims. First, it should be used to support the relief effort. The hope is that the higher the profile of international military support in Bosnia, the greater the chance of monitoring, if not reducing, the violence. However, the continued bombing of Sarajevo in the presence of UN peacekeepers may suggest that whatever military force is deployed will meet resistance. Second, military intervention should be coupled with more pressure on the Serbian leadership in Belgrade and in Sarajevo to control all the Serb war-lords on the ground in Bosnia-Hercegovina. This might be partly achieved by preventing logistical support and weapons reaching Bosnia's Serbs through blocking off the entire airspace between Serbia, Montenegro and Bosnia-Hercegovina. But it would also mean trying to disarm Bosnia's Croats, who are backed by the government in Zagreb. Like Serbia, Croatia is involved in a land grab at the expense of Bosnia's Moslems. Despite these limited objectives, Nato officials remain cautious about becoming embroiled in Bosnia. 'We are agonising over the whole problem. Public pressure is demanding that we be seen to be doing something. But to tell you the truth, I still do not know what our level of involvement should be,' said a Nato official. 'Yugoslavia is a military minefield. I am not even sure it could pacified with airpower. It would take tens of thousands of ground troops to cover the terrain. On another level, we are dealing with fanatics on the ground. You have these crazy, trigger-happy Serb war-lords, heavily-armed Croats and desperate Moslems. The war in Bosnia has radicalised every ethnic group at the expense of innocent civilians,' he said. Other Nato officials said it was unclear how the Serbs would react if a UN-backed military intervention was launched. One official said the Serbs would either clearly identify the UN as 'the enemy' and would, therefore, fight back, or they would retreat rapidly at the sight of well-armed western forces. 'If you could be sure that military intervention, on any level, would work, then sure, you could consider it. But you don't want to end up with a guerrilla warfare,' the Nato official said. Despite the sense of uncertainty and anxiety about how to respond to the war in Bosnia, a consensus is emerging: the longer the west prevaricates, the greater the chance the war could spread to other parts of the Balkan peninsula. 'I agree that if we do not take any kind of military action, the war will spread outside Bosnia. I have no doubt of that. The next flash-point is (the Serbian controlled province of) Kosovo. Maybe even in Macedonia,' the Nato official said. Defence analysts in London go one stage further. 'It is not only a question about the war spreading, and many more people getting killed in Bosnia. It is about Europe's future security policy in eastern Europe and the Balkans,' said Ms Jane Sharp, a defence expert at Kings College and at the London-based Institute for Public Policy Research. She added: 'By not taking direct action of any kind, the west is indirectly propping up a bully - Serbia. This has an effect on what will happen in the region as a whole. We are telling potential dictators, in eastern Europe, or the republics of the former Soviet Union to go ahead with ethnic cleansing and grabbing land. If we turn our backs on Bosnia now, we will have to pay the price in the coming years.'</p>

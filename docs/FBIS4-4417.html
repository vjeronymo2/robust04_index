			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "U.S. Unhappy With Package of </F> External Economic Measures"]    [Text] On 29 March, the Japanese Government decided on a  package of external economic measures. The U.S. Government  reacted by criticizing the package as "insufficient" and made it  clear that it would not go along with Japan's call for a  resumption of the stalled Japan-U.S. economic framework talks.  The Japanese Government is trying to accept the U.S. reaction  calmly, noting: "Their reaction is somewhat tougher than we had  anticipated" (according to a top official of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry). The U.S. Government has  criticized almost all aspects of the package including  management of Japan's macroeconomic policy and the automobile  and auto parts sector. As a result, attention will focus on  whether the Hosokawa government will be able to map out another  package of more concrete measures opening up the Japanese market  and relaxing bureaucratic regulations, while overriding  resistance from the business community and concerned ministries  and agencies, and overcoming the rift in the ruling coalition  parties before July when the summit talks of major  industrialized nations (the Naples summit), which will mark a  juncture in Japan-U.S. relations, are held.    At a 30 March session of the House of Representatives Budget  Committee, Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata said: "U.S. Trade  Representative Kantor is not disappointed with the package; it  is a first step. I have heard that he will pay attention to how  Japan maps out another package of measures in June."    The government itself has acknowledged that it had decided  to  delay taking more concrete measures on opening up the Japanese  market and relaxing regulations by the end of June. The prime  minister had expressed hopes for resuming the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks when the package was announced. But,  the consensus in concerned ministries and agencies is that "it  would be impossible for the package to open the way for resuming  the framework talks."    U.S. Trade Representative Kantor has said, "The ball is  still  in Japan's court," but it is not easy for Japan to hit the ball  back into the U.S. court. With regard to the macroeconomic  measures--the focal points of which are the continuation of tax  cuts and an increase in public investment--Japan needs to settle  the issue of raising the consumption tax. With the waning  unifying force of the Hosokawa government, the issue of raising  the consumption tax will undoubtedly develop into an issue that  could shake the Hosokawa government.    As one of the conditions for resuming the framework talks,  Mr. Kantor has cited "the use of qualitative and quantitative  indexes to determine whether opening the Japanese market is  successful in the individual sectors." In this way, he has  hinted that the United States would again bring up "numerical  targets" for discussion; this was one of the causes for the  break off of the framework talks.    U.S. Ambassador to Tokyo Mondale has criticized plans  compiled by Japanese automakers to boost their purchase of  foreign-made auto parts, pointing to "their low growth rate."  Saying "I am especially disappointed" with the automobile sector  in the package, the U.S. ambassador has called on Japan to take  more concrete measures to boost its imports of not only  foreign-made auto parts, but foreign-made automobiles.    However, it is difficult for Japanese automakers to  drastically increase their purchase of foreign-made auto parts.  The government has kept the door to compromise with the United  States on the numerical targets closed and there is no room for  the government to concede to the United States in the individual  sectors. The United States is expected to ask Japan to take bold  steps to relax regulations and give foreign firms more access to  government procurement.    Finance Minister Fujii, MITI minister Kumagai, and Chief  Cabinet Secretary Takemura are all in charge of mapping out the  measures for opening the Japanese market and relaxing  bureaucratic regulations. While Fujii and Kumagai are affiliated  with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party], Mr. Takemura is affiliated  with Sakigake [Harbinger]. Some point out that the ongoing  delicate confrontation within the ruling coalition parties is  making it difficult for the coalition government to deal with  external issues.</p>

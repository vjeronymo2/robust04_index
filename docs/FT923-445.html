			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (17): The engines that drove civilisation THE POWER OF THE MACHINE by R A Buchanan Viking Pounds 20, 299 pages WHAT DRIVES the wheels of progress? The machine. What drives the machine? Wind, fire, water, electricity, nuclear fission: even, in antiquity as in poor countries today, the patient ox and the sweating labourer. In this highly readable book Angus Buchanan reflects on the technological revolution which has driven the last three centuries at an increasingly furious gallop. This is an aspect of history which often gets ignored as we hasten to read of political intrigues and great battles. But real historical forces lie long and deep; as Buchanan shows, it is technology that shapes civilisations. A history of technology has to address itself to three issues. One concerns the invention and development of technologies. It is difficult to fathom an inventor's psychological processes, but it is a fair bet that they have to be well-prepared, and faced with a problem, for ideas to spark. Development of technologies is a more objective matter, and can be traced historically. Here the first issue merges with the second, concerning the spread of technology. Some hold that technological knowledge is transmitted by travellers and traders, others that similar technologies arise simultaneously but unconnectedly in different places. Both arguments can be supported by historical evidence, but both offer puzzles. The third issue concerns the social impact of technology. This is the sphere in which technology makes its civilisation-transforming impact most felt. Two examples illustrate the point. New agricultural technologies make food more abundant, thus supporting population growth. This puts pressure on social institutions, which have to change in response. A butterfly effect, magnifying changes as they spread, flows outwards from the higher crop yields in the fields. Another example is military technology. When one state achieves superiority over others, it exerts dominance; whether by conquest or influence, such dominance changes relationships, and alters the flow of goods, wealth and people around the world. About 1000 BC the Bronze Age gave way to the Iron Age; the reason for the switch - once furnaces could be made hot enough to work iron - was that iron takes a better edge than bronze. So weapons, and axes for felling forests, became sharper; and they cut a new direction for history. Buchanan's main concern is with the period from 1700 AD. Since then technological change has been extraordinarily rapid. The key is power. Power is what makes possible any kind of making and doing, the stuff of technology. So Buchanan begins the main part of his book with a discussion of sources of power, from animals (including man) up to the internal combustion engine and electricity. The importance of the 18th century as marking a sudden acceleration in technological development is the advent of steam power. The idea of steam power was first mooted by Hero of Alexander in antiquity, but it was only in the late 18th century, partly as a result of advancement in natural science, that the idea became reality. Scientific enquiry had offered two crucial discoveries: that the atmosphere has weight, and that a partial vacuum can be created in a closed vessel. It is a relatively simple matter to put these ideas to work. Place a freely moving piston in a cylinder closed at the bottom and open at the top. Introduce steam below the piston; condense it with a jet of cold water, thus creating a partial vacuum, and atmospheric pressure will push the piston down. Attach the piston to a beam to which other rods or wheels are connected, and motion is imparted to them - to raise water, turn looms, pull loads. The piston is raised again by the weight of the attachments to the beam in the course of its revolution, and the process begins again. Refinements to this simple device soon had whole landscapes of smoking factories at work, producing goods to be whistled by rail to quaysides where freighters lay ready to steam across the seas. The economic and technological impulse of these developments led in an accelerating path to other forms of engine based on more powerful and flexible principles. Transport and communications provide examples of the revolution which has taken place in the present century alone; but at a cost, in pollution among other things, which makes Buchanan gravely doubt whether it is sustainable. From the sources of power to its uses, and from these to the effects of technology on people, the state, and the future: Buchanan takes us on a thought-provoking and instructive tour of the facts and problems. He shows that anyone living reflectively in the complexities of the present should wish to be soundly informed about technology, its history and its meaning. His book enjoyably satisfies that wish.</p>

			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: South Africa Gold shares surged by 8.2 per cent in Johannesburg as the bullion price hit a five-month high, and renewed confidence spilled over into selected industrials. The golds index closed 177 stronger at 2,331, industrials rose 121 to 5,717 and the overall index climbed 179 to a closing peak of 5,088. Zimbabwean stocks soared to new highs following Saturday's 17 per cent devaluation of the local dollar and renewed foreign investor interest. The industrial index added 83.94 at 2,440.95, its best level since 1991, and the mining index rose 23.30 to a record 566.04.</p>

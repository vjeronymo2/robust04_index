			<p>BFN     [Text] London, June 29, IRNA -- The British Government has  denounced last week's terrorist bomb blast at the holy shrine of  Imam Reza (as) in Mashhad and offered commiserations for the  Iranian pilgrim victims. The denunciation was made by assistant  under-secretary to the Foreign Office [FCO], Andrew Green,  during a meeting Monday [27 June] with the Iranian charge  d'affaires to London, Gholamreza Ansari.    In the meeting, the Iranian charge delivered a letter from  Foreign Minister 'Ali Akbar Velayati, to his British  counterpart, Douglas Hurd, in which he called upon the UK  Government to terminate the activities of the Mojahedin Khalq  (MKO) terrorist group following its bombing of the shrine.    A similar message is understood to have been relayed to  other  European governments, which allow the activities of the  anti-Iran terrorist group to go on unhindered in their countries.    In response, Green said that the British policy was clear in  taking all appropriate measures to combat terrorism in Britain.  He said the UK Government "condemned the bomb explosion and its  perpetrators" and conveyed its condolences to the Iranian  people. He added that "Britain does not in any way support the  MKO."    With regard to the anti-Iran terrorist group taking over  Persian programs on London's Spectrum radio on the day of its  bombing attack in Mashhad, the British official said radio  stations in the UK were free to broadcast as long as it was  within the law. Any breach of law would be a matter for the  radio authority, who report to the Department of National  Heritage under the terms of the 1991 Broadcasting Act and Green  acknowledged that an official complaint was being investigated.    The complaint was understood to have been raised by the  chairman of the Britain-Iran parliamentary group, Peter  Temple-Morris, who told IRNA Tuesday that he was raising the  matter with the British minister responsible for broadcasting.  The terrorist exploits of the MKO are well documented and the  Conservative MP called it a "very sad error" to allow the  station, which is officially authorized, to be used for  subversive purposes in broadcasting anti- Iran propaganda. He  said the organization had the technique of coming through in  various disguises and making themselves as very presentable and  pleasant young men that very few people in the west actually  realized their terrorist background.    When challenged about allowing the terrorist group to  transmit its propaganda, managing director of Spectrum, Wolfgang  Bucci, said that the MKO presented itself as an "intellectual  refugee group" under the name of Iranzamin. He said that its  first week of broadcasts had worried him and had been surprized  to learn more about the group that commonly describes itself as  the National Council of Resistance of Iran.</p>

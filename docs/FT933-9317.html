			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Strong demand for asset-backed FRNs THE international bond market was enlivened yesterday by the launch of the first securitisation of consumer loans in the sterling sector. Demand from domestic and foreign investors for the Pounds 190m offering of asset-backed floating-rate notes, issued by First National Finance Corporation, was such that the entire deal was placed by late afternoon, according to the underwriter, Baring Brothers. Mr Tim Ingram, group finance director of First National Finance Corporation, said the company planned at least two public securitisations a year, the purpose of which would be to reduce bank debt. The issue was made up of Pounds 170m of senior Triple A notes and supported by a Pounds 20m tranche of mezzanine subordinated notes. The notes are backed by 80,000 unsecured consumer loans, advanced for home improvements, and are expected to have an average life of just under four years. Barings said the notes offered investors a return of 55 basis points over the three-month Sterling London Inter Bank Offered Rate (Libor). The notes were priced at a slight discount to par and were offered at par when they were freed to trade in the late afternoon. Also in the sterling sector, English &amp; Scottish Investors raised Pounds 25m through the issue of debenture stock due 2023. The stock's gross redemption yield was fixed at 75 basis points over the semi-annual yield of the UK Treasury's 8 3/4 per cent stock due 2017, which stood at 8.282 per cent yesterday. Mr John Cameron, director at the underwriters, Kleinwort Benson, said that the stock's coupon of 8 1/4 per cent represented the lowest borrowing cost for an investment trust since the 1960s. Elsewhere, Commerzbank raised DM500m through an issue of five-year Eurobonds with a coupon of 6 per cent. An official said the break-even price for underwriters was 99.20 and that the bonds were being offered at 99.35 in the afternoon. He added that the bonds were being placed in Switzerland, the Benelux countries and through the bank's domestic retail network. Syndicate managers said that the recent volatility in the European exchange rate mechanism and hopes of a cut in German interest rates had increased the attraction of the D-Mark sector.</p>

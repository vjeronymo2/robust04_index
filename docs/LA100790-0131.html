			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY CAME, THEY WROTE, THEY CONQUERED;  </P> <P> MRS. HUMPHRY WARD; EMINENT VICTORIAN, PREEMINENT EDWARDIAN BY JOHN SUTHERLAND  (OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95; 432 PP.)  </P> <P> On April 10, 1920, Virginia Woolf noted in her diary, "Mrs. Ward is dead; poor  Mrs. Humphry Ward; and it appears that she was merely a woman of straw after  all -- shovelled into the grave and already forgotten."  </P> <P> Mary Ward had been dead two weeks. Seventy years later, although largely  unread, she is not altogether forgotten, and John Sutherland's bold  disinterment of this prolific writer and prodigious personality who towered  over Victorian and Edwardian England makes enthralling reading.  </P> <P> At the height of her fame, Mrs. Humphry Ward, as she always styled herself  (less a gesture of matronly modesty than a claim to masculine authority),  commanded vast readerships and vast advances on both sides of the Atlantic.  From 1888, America was swamped by competing pirate editions of "Robert  Elsmere," her mammoth novel of religious doubt. To her horror, free copies were  given away with Maine's Balsam Fir Soap, described by Sutherland, with typical  dryness, as "a newly launched product which wished to impress on consumers the  literal truth of cleanliness being next to godliness."  </P> <P> Sutherland compares the novel's American success to that of "Uncle Tom's Cabin"  in Britain, both nations being virtuously fascinated by problems they did not  have to face. The issue now raised, in Oliver Wendell Holmes' words, was the  long-needed purging of "the obstructed channels of the decrepit theological  system," and even, so it was thought, the separation of church and state.  </P> <P> Part of the excitement was caused by the reaction of Gladstone, the British  prime minister to whom the book represented a dangerous national trend toward  agnosticism. He wrote a long, vehement, essay, "Robert Elsmere, and the Battle  of Belief," and, obsessed by the book, demanded a private interview with its  author on the evening after her mother's death. Their passionate argument was  resumed at breakfast; she left "the wonderful old man" white-faced, leaning on  the table, while she, trembling but unbeaten, went to follow the hearse.  </P> <P> The encounter typifies more than Mary Ward's love of a good fight. She wrote,  Sutherland suggests, precisely to prove herself to men of authority and power  like Gladstone; the heirs of her grandfather, Thomas Arnold of Rugby: Jowett,  Pattison and Pater at Oxford and J. R. Green in London; and above all, her own  errant, backsliding father, Tom, and her uncle, Matthew Arnold. Her best novels  -- "Robert Elsmere," "Marcella" and the fine "Helbeck of Bannisdale" --  re-worked not only her own experience but the religious rifts that drove her  parents, and her age, apart.  </P> <P> "Uncle Matt" memorably dismissed Mary's first novel, "Miss Bretherton,"  published in 1884: "No Arnold can write a novel; if they could, I should have  done it" -- doubly cruel, since she so wanted acceptance as a true Arnold.  Nonetheless, she went on to become, in Sutherland's phrase, a "fiction  machine," churning out novels to support her family.  </P> <P> Her earnings were high, and her fiction was serialized for top prices in  America in the Century, Harpers and the Ladies' Home Journal (whose cheap  presentation galled her pride while it filled her purse). But rather than  helping her family, she may have crushed them instead.  </P> <P> Her husband Humphry, art critic of the Times of London, took refuge in buying  old masters (often fakes) and playing billiards at the Athenaeum. Refusing to  enfranchise her clever daughters, Mary heaped her ambitions on her son, the  ominously christened Arnold: Ineffectual in politics, disgraced in the army,  his gambling debts absorbed all she had so laboriously gained.  </P> <P> Irony also marks Mary Ward's other achievements. A founder of Somerville, the  first women's college in Oxford, in 1879, she went on to become the tireless  leader of the Anti-Suffrage Movement and to write a virulently anti-suffragist  novel, "Delia Blanchflower." She opened two settlements for the London poor  (University Hall and the Passmore Edwards Settlement), started the day-center  movement and introduced schools for the physically handicapped, but spent her  last years among the Hertfordshire gentry, a staunch Conservative and  imperialist.  </P> <P> A final flourish of transatlantic fame followed her vivid, jingoistic accounts  of life in the trenches. The first of these, "England's Effort," was written in  response to a suggestion made in December of 1915 by her friend, former  President Theodore Roosevelt, that articles from Mary Ward, who was at the  time, Sutherland says, "the best-known Englishwoman in America," might help him  to swing American opinion in favor of entering the war.  </P> <P> What lay behind her urgent, swerving career? In 1856, when she was 5, her  family returned to England after Tom Arnold's first swing to Catholicism had  put an end to a promising career as education secretary in Tasmania. When her  parents, with her younger brothers and sisters, decamped to live under John  Henry Newman's wing in Dublin, Mary was left stranded in Westmoreland with her  Arnold grandmother. Lonely and fiery-tempered, she struggled through grim  boarding schools for the next 10 years until she rejoined her family, by now  established in Oxford. From then on, Sutherland portrays her as driven by a  desperate need to be "at the center" -- of Oxford, London, the nation.  </P> <P> Steely self-will and hidden vulnerability were blended in her dealings with her  family, her publishers and her political allies. All are meticulously  chronicled here.  </P> <P> Sutherland's approach, though cool and unblinkered, is consistently  sympathetic; yet even he sometimes displays an appalled fascination at his  subject's monstrous energy, all the more striking since she was wracked by  constant, devastating illnesses (which, like those of Josephine Butler or  Florence Nightingale, often proved strategically useful). She battled on  against all odds, dosing herself with remedies that would make a pharmacist  pale, including a cherished hoard of "cocaine lozenges."  </P> <P> As the Great War ended, younger writers -- Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, H.  G. Wells, Rebecca West -- attacked or ridiculed "Mrs H. W." as the embodiment  of the most stifling Victorian values. Their hostility was a measure of her  power. Even 16 years after she died, her nephew Aldous Huxley drew her as the  smothering Mrs. Foxe in "Eyeless in Gaza."  </P> <P> She left no literary heirs, and in that sense she was, as Woolf said, "a woman  of straw." But "splendid" was Mary Ward's favorite adjective -- and splendid,  in an awesome, even tragic way -- is exactly what she was.  </P></p>

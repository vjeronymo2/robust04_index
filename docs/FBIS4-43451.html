			<p>BFN     [Text] Responding to a question on the latest statement by  Rauf Denktas, government spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis noted  that what Denktas says does not constitute acceptance of the 21  March document. The spokesman stressed: Our position remains  that we do not negotiate any further nor do we accept changes to  the 21 March document. The spokesman added that the United  Nations has not conveyed to our side that the new positions  adopted by Denktas constitute a satisfactory answer.    The government spokesman also said that President Glavkos  Kliridhis is committed to the unanimous decisions of the  National Council and will resort to a people's verdict  [referendum] on the confidence-building measures talks in the  event there is a question of disagreement with the National  Council. Mr. Kasoulidhis said: President Kliridhis will turn  to the people in the event he is forced to continue the talks on  the confidence-building measures despite the unanimous position  of the National Council.</p>

			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Brian Redhead - Voice of Today: Obituary It has often been said (mainly by its producers, admittedly) that the Today programme on BBC Radio 4 sets the day's agenda for politicians and journalists alike. Any truth in this should be credited chiefly to Brian Redhead, who died yesterday at the age of 64. A scholarship boy from Newcastle upon Tyne, he joined the Manchester Guardian when he came down from Cambridge, and rose rapidly to become editor of its sister paper, the Manchester Evening News. When he left in 1975 to succeed Robert Robinson as presenter of Today, the breakfast programme was mixing news and entertainment. It was Redhead as much as a new generation of producers who turned it into the grittier all-news programme which was sought out by Cabinet ministers wishing to catch the ear of the prime minister early in the day. Baroness Thatcher, who was a dedicated listener, said yesterday: 'The breadth and depth of his knowledge were quite outstanding, and I always enjoyed being interviewed by him.' Mr John Major said: 'I shall remember him for his feisty interviewing style and the ever-present twinkle in his eye. He will be greatly missed.' Redhead said the job was 'the best in journalism'. Just before 5am in the Today office you could always hear him coming: he whistled all the way down the long corridor from the lifts. It irritated some of his colleagues - which only encouraged him, as did their grumbles about his intellectual arrogance. They could not deny that he was well-read, quick, politically astute, and could handle any interview at the drop of a hat. His main interest outside journalism was religion. Yet it was only after William, one of his four children, was killed in a car crash when he was 18 that Redhead became a regular churchgoer. He was due to retire this year from Today and there had been talk of his then taking holy orders although he recently denied this. He leaves a widow, Jenni, two sons and a daughter.</p>

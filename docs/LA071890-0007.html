			<p><P> July 18, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AUTHORITIES BREAK UP RIOT AT JOB TRAINING FACILITY  </P> <P> More than 30 law enforcement officers, clad in helmets and armed with batons,  broke up what was termed "a small-scale riot" Monday night at the Job Corps  Training Center dormitory in Imperial Beach.  </P> <P> A team of San Diego police officers and county sheriff's deputies arrested  seven people -- all participants in the federal training program -- after a  struggle to bring a crowd of about 50 job trainees under control, said Sgt.  Glenn Revell, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> The riot, which left nine people hospitalized, apparently broke out because of  the arrest of a Job Corps trainee after a disturbance on an Imperial Beach  street earlier in the evening, said Sgt. John Maschka of the Sheriff  Department's Imperial Beach substation.  </P> <P> "A group of people from the Job Training Center were wandering the streets of  Imperial Beach, causing trouble," Maschka said. "They were just being kind of  rowdy and boisterous."  </P> <P> After deputies warned the group twice to calm down, they arrested one trainee  about 9:20 p.m., Revell said. He was identified as Charles Edward Thomas Jr.,  19.  </P> <P> Thomas had allegedly scuffled with the deputies, injuring one of them slightly,  Revell said.  </P> <P> "Apparently, the group went back to the (Job Corps) center to try to incite the  others into taking some form of retaliation against the police," Maschka said.  </P> <P> That started a riot at the Iris Avenue center, Maschka said.  </P> <P> Officers from the San Diego Police Department, Sheriff's Department and the  U.S. Border Patrol converged on the scene around 10:15 p.m., accompanied by a  canine unit and a helicopter team, Revell said.  </P> <P> "Upon arrival, the deputies heard screams and the sound of breaking glass  coming from inside one dormitory," Revell said.  </P> <P> They moved into the dormitory and found the trainees fighting among themselves,  Revell said.  </P> <P> "They were fighting with each other," Revell said. "They were not fighting the  officers."  </P> <P> Officers brought the situation under control around 11 p.m., Revell said.  </P> <P> The seven people arrested, all ages 18 to 25, were job trainees who lived at  the center, Revell said.  </P> <P> About 500 to 600 young people live and study at the center, a residential  education facility directed by the U.S. Department of Labor, Revell said.  </P> <P> No officers were injured while bringing the riot under control, Revell said.  </P></p>

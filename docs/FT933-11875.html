			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Survey of Ghana (5): Deficit goes up LAST year's economic difficulties show clearly in Ghana's balance of payments. A projected current account deficit of 3.2 per cent of gross domestic product became 5.5 per cent of GDP by year end. Combined with a shortfall in aid flows, this deficit converted a projected balance of payments surplus into a deficit of 1.8 per cent of GDP. The international environment is partly to blame. The dollar price per ton of cocoa fell by 5 per cent compared to the previous year, although production volumes were also unexpectedly depressed - 243,000 tons against a projected 262,000 tons. The significant decline in Ghana's terms of trade meant that, while total export volumes grew 4.6 per cent, values fell by 1.1 per cent. Poor export performance was compounded by excessive imports: values grew by 10.5 per cent last year, twice as fast as expected. The surge mainly reflected pre-election expansion in government and consumer demand. The result was that the Bank of Ghana lost a third of its foreign exchange reserves. By the year-end they had fallen to Dollars 346.5m, 2.6 months of imports, from 4.1 months of imports at the end of 1991. The cedi depreciated from 390 cedis per dollar in the final quarter of 1991 to 520 cedis per dollar in the fourth quarter of 1992 and had fallen towards 650 cedi per dollar by the middle of this year. The government does not expect the current account balance to improve this year. While imports are projected to grow by 4.2 per cent, exports values are expected to rise by a disappointing 2.9 per cent: largely the product of continued weakness in world cocoa prices. The government hopes that cocoa production will recover to 280m tons, exceeding last year's projected levels, but earnings are expected to fall by a further 10 per cent. The result is a projected deterioration in the current account deficit of 5.9 per cent of GDP. Debt service payments will also jump this year, consuming a projected 37.7 per cent of export earnings as principal repayments become due, before falling to 24 per cent next year and 25 per cent in 1995. Outstanding debts remain equal to 58 per cent of GDP. While the burden of debt service payments has fallen from its mid-1980s high of 57 per cent of export earnings, it remains a substantial drain on the country's domestic resources. Hence the World Bank's calculation that Ghana would need external financing of Dollars 1.7bn over the next two years. The donors have obliged, deciding last month to increase aid flows above the World Bank's minimum. This should bring great improvement in the capital account this year; it should return the balance of payments to surplus and enable reserves to be rebuilt. The government is confident that it can achieve its target of a balance of payments surplus of Dollars 167.5, 2.6 per cent of GDP and rebuild its reserves to over Dollars 500m by the end of 1993, 3.7 months of imports - assuming that the budget remains on track and that the cocoa harvest is good, too.  ---------------------------------------------------------------                   BALANCE OF PAYMENTS (DOLLARS M)  ---------------------------------------------------------------                             1990     1991     1992      1993*  --------------------------------------------------------------- Exports                    896.8     997.6    986.3     1014.6 Imports                   1205      1318.7   1456.6     1517.6  --------------------------------------------------------------- Trade balance             -308.2    -321.1   -470.3     -503 Net services              -325.5    -352.5   -376.2     -398.4 Current account            -218     -251.7   -376.1     -374.9 Overall balance**           118      170.8   -124.3      167.5  --------------------------------------------------------------- * IMF projections ** Discrepancy between current and capital account is errors and omissions  --------------------------------------------------------------- Source:  Ministry of Finance, IMF  ---------------------------------------------------------------</p>

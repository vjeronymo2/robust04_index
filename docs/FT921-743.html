			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Corporate results provide the interest CORPORATE results provided the interest on most bourses yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT traded in a narrow range as attention remained on Veba and Schering. Further evidence that the Bundesbank was still not on top of inflation held the market back. The DAX index rose 2.76 to 1,719.02 while the FAZ index, calculated at midsession, eased 0.26 to 698.21. Turnover fell to DM5.2bn from DM5.5bn. Schering dropped DM9 to DM826.80 in heavy volume of 327,142 shares on disappointment about the delay in selling off non-core businesses. Veba, which announced a rise in the dividend after the close on Wednesday, jumped DM5.50 to DM383.30. Retailers were depressed by a trade association report which predicted that growth in west German retail sales would slow to a real 1.5 per cent in 1992 from 5.6 per cent last year. Kaufhof fell DM3.50 to DM513 while ASKO, a recent favourite, gave up DM10 to DM890 in big volume of 403,716 shares. Less liquid stocks were on the move, with Linde up DM6 to DM819 while the haircare products company Wella eased DM8.50 to DM619. PARIS saw volatility in some stocks while the broad market moved higher. Turnover was modest at just under FFr2bn as the CAC-40 index added 6.47 to 1,934.75. CMB, the packaging company, fell FFr11.20 or 5.6 per cent to FFr186.40 after analysts were told at a meeting with the company that the first quarter of 1992 had been disappointing. Several brokers said they were trimming their 1992 earnings forecasts as a result, with Cheuvreux de Virieu making the most noise about it. Dealers said profit-taking in CMB had been inevitable in view of its 30 per cent outperformance over the last 12 months. Cerus, the French holding company of the Italian entrepreneur Mr Carlo De Benedetti, rose FFr7.50 or 5.6 per cent to FFr140.50 on rumours that it would sell it Banque Dumenil-Leble unit. Poliet for once gave the market a pleasant surprise by releasing good 1991 results, and was rewarded with a FFr21 or 3.9 per cent increase in its share price to FFr550. Generale des Eaux rose FFr52 to FFr2,290 on reports of positive developments in its property interests. MILAN's depression deepened, following this week's poor banking results and further evidence of the massive divergence in the government's public sector borrowing requirement. Analysts saw little prospect of the market recovering after the general election and some said optimism that Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist leader, would be the next premier was misplaced. The Comit index fell 2.32 to 496.97, a new low for the year but still above the 480 chart support level, while turnover was estimated at L83bn after L91.9bn. Dealers detected some support buying by the big corporate groups. The banking sector remained weak, with Banca Commerciale Italiana falling L62 or 1.7 per cent to L3,540. In telecoms, Stet rose L26 to L2,110 ahead of its board meeting later in the day while Sirti rose L25 to L10,440 after announcing a 14 per cent rise in 1991 consolidated net profit. ZURICH focused on the chemical sector with Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz reporting 1991 earnings. Ciba-Geigy, which announced a five-for-one share split, shed early gains and its certificates closed steady at SFr3,450, while its bearers dipped SFr20 to SFr3,430. Sandoz, which is to raise its dividend by SFr5, saw its bearers and registered shares both fall SFr20 to SFr2,590 each. Roche, which has yet to release 1991 results, went against the trend with certificates up SFr50 to SFr3,050 and bearers gaining SFr10 to SFr4,280. The SMI index finished up 5.5 at 1,835.6. AMSTERDAM featured Daf after the truck manufacturer reported a net loss for 1991 of Fl 395m and then said it was holding talks with the government and banks to strengthen its capital base. The shares closed unchanged at Fl 24.20 but analysts said that in spite of forecasting a stronger second half, prospects remained unfavourable. The CBS Tendency Index rose 0.6 to 125.6 in turnover of Fl 485.7m. KLM was up 20 cents to Fl 36.50, on news released after the close on Wednesday that it was to expand its European flight network. Nutricia was down 80 cents at Fl 172 ahead of its results. Polygram, which is to raise Fl 250m from a commercial paper issue, advanced Fl 1.00 to Fl 45.00. STOCKHOLM fell on profit-taking with the Affarsvarlden General Index falling 5.2 to 1,004.1 in turnover of SKr617m after SKr845m. Volvo, which has been actively traded this week following news of management restructuring, slipped back with its B shares down SKr4 to SKr426. Procordia B also fell back, losing SKr2 to SKr197. MADRID's general index closed 1.52 ahead at 255.57. Corporacion Mapfre, which announced plans to raise Pta10bn through three-year convertible bond issue, shed Pta230 or 5 per cent to Pta4,270.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - MAR 26  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes Open     10 am    11 am    12 pm    1 pm     2 pm    3 pm     close 1147.68  1146.76  1146.62  1146.20  1146.58  1147.28 1146.92  1146.25  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Day's High  1147.80    Day's Low  1145.94  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Mar 25    Mar 24   Mar 23    Mar 20    Mar 19 1144.53   1142.88  1142.05   1153.93   1153.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

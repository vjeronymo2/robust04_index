			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Wendy Gramm to quit as head of CFTC MRS Wendy Gramm, the head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the US agency that oversees the burgeoning US futures and options markets, said yesterday that she would join the flood of US officials departing Washington with Mr George Bush in January. Speaking informally to reporters as she left a meeting in Washington, she said that she would leave her post as CFTC chairwoman in January and retire from government. News of her departure, coming less than a week after Mr Bush's defeat at the polls, caught the futures industry unawares, but is not surprising. A loyal appointee of Mr Bush and wife of a powerful Republican Senator from Texas, Mr Phil Gramm, Mrs Gramm found herself politically mispositioned and philosophically at odds with the incoming administration of Mr Bill Clinton. Mrs Gramm, while likely to lose her position as chairwoman under Mr Clinton, had the option of continuing on as a CFTC commissioner until April 1995. Her departure will give Mr Clinton the opportunity to appoint three of the agency's five commissioners early in his term. She was appointed to the post in 1988 after working in the Budget office of the Reagan White House, and immediately found herself defending her agency and the futures industry from the fall-out from the October 1987 stock market crash. Nearly her entire tenure at the CFTC was spent defending the agency in a battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US securities watchdog, which was bidding for futures oversight, and with obtaining landmark legis-lation defining the CFTC's powers. She successfully shepherded the CFTC reauthorisation bill through Congress in early September. Futures industry officials believe that this will complete her legislative mission, and means that she would have been ready to leave the CFTC even if Mr Bush had gained a second term. Mr John Damgard, head of the Futures Industry Association, the Washington-based futures industry lobbying group, said: 'Mrs Gramm has been an excellent chairman of the CFTC. 'She has steadfastly and consistently advocated free and open markets and encouraged competition.' Several possible successors have recently visited Washington, including at least two Democratic congressmen and a leading Democratic staffer at the agency.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with IFP spokesman Walter Felgate, ANC </F> spokesman Dullah Omar, and Constitutional Development Minister  and NP chief negotiator Roelf Meyer by announcer Rodney Trudgeon  on the "Radio Today" program--live]    [Text] [Trudgeon] There's growing fear that South Africa's  first democratic elections may not occur if no agreement is  reached between Government and ANC [African National Congress]  negotiators on the one hand, and the Freedom Alliance on the  other. On the line right now we have Mr. Walter Felgate from  the IFP [Inkatha Freedom Party] and also Mr. Dulla Omar from the  ANC to explain something about what the situation is at present.  If we can begin with you, Mr. Felgate, what is the IFP's  standpoint at the moment with what seems to be a fairly major  deadlock in negotiations?    [Felgate] Well, the IFP is seeking to give some kind of  realistic and meaningful role for provinces in the building of  democracy. Things hang together. The provincial constitution,  the provincial power, the financing for provincial functions and  the protection of these structures and functions all hang  together. Damage to one is damage to all. And as the  constitution is now written, the constitutional assembly with a  text introduced by as little as a 50 percent plus one majority  could replace the penned constitution with an entirely new  constitution and that new constitution could obliterate  everything that is done in the interim period at the provincial  constitutional level. There is no continuity guaranteed,  there's no powers that are guaranteed, there are no structures  that are guaranteed, and indeed if you look carefully at the  principles, the principles of any value only come into operation  after the next constitution is actually adopted.    [Trudgeon] Mr. Dullah Omar of the ANC is also on the line  with us. Mr. Omar, why are you so keen -- having heard that --  that the IFP should take part in the elections?    [Omar] We are keen that the IFP should participate in the  election because we consider them to be an important player in  South Africa, and it would be in the broader interest of the  country that they do take part. I think, however, that Mr.  Felgate is not correct in a number of things.    Firstly there's nowhere in the constitution any provision  that the constitutional assembly can by a resolution of 50  percent plus one adopt any constitution. This is completely  incorrect. The constitution provides that a constitutional  assembly shall adopt a new constitution by a two thirds  majority. It also provides that when it also comes to the  question of power, functions of regions, the provisions of a new  constitution must also be adopted by the senate by a two thirds  majority.    [Trudgeon] Now, Mr. Felgate, we've also heard that the  Freedom Alliance is going to register as a political party,  which is quite a significant move, isn't it?    [Felgate] But I think you must first allow me a very short  rejoinder to what Mr. Dullah Omar has just said. It is entirely  true that the only constitutional text that could go to a panel  of constitutional experts, could go to a constitutional court,  could be put before the people in a referendum. The only  constitution in that process could in fact be introduced by a 50  percent plus one majority. I did not say adopt; I said  introduce. But if that's the only constitution that we can  consider, then it has very serious implications. Around the  world it is already the other way round. A special majority is  required to adopt a constitution or even introduce a  constitution and a simpler majority is required in a referendum.  That rejoinder just must be made, sorry I interrupted you.    [Trudgeon] No, fine. I interrupted you. Do carry on about  your comments about the Freedom Alliance becoming or registering  as a political party.    [Felgate] The Freedom Alliance has made no decision  whatsoever to register as political party. The component  members of the Freedom Alliance may or may not register. We as  an alliance are adamant on one thing, and that is that we cannot  enter into an election under the present constitution with its  restrictions. The IFP has made it very clear as a component of  the Freedom Alliance that we will not begin thinking about  registration until we have got some kind of an all-inclusive  constitutional settlement. So the registration issue arises  only once we have got an all-inclusive constitutional settlement.    [Trudgeon] Thank you Mr. Walter Felgate of the IFP for  joining us and still on the line is Mr. Dullah Omar. Mr. Omar,  this regional problem seems to be a major stumbling block with  the Freedom Alliance, and with the IFP in particular. Do you  agree that it is an important issue for them that should be  considered by the government and the ANC?    [Omar] It is an important issue. I also think it is an  important issue for us. I want to add, however, that in respect  of all those matters that Mr. Felgate has raised, adequate  protection has been created. I think I must point out that with  regard to Section 126 which deals with the powers and functions  of regions. Both the ANC and the government moved considerably  in order to accommodate the Freedom Alliance. You know the  problem is you cannot negotiate at gun point. It is difficult  for the ANC to negotiate when we are accosted with a set of  demands which are put to us as being nonnegotiable and as a take  it or leave it situation.    Now with regard to powers and functions of regions, we moved  considerably. The present constitution provides for concurrent  powers only. We moved and said that there are a number of  aspects in which we would agree to exclusive powers for regions,  and regions would have been able, provinces would have been able  to exercise autonomy in respect of all these powers. There are  certain matters in respect of which concurrent powers should  remain -- matters such as education, health, and generally  matters of national concern. But even in respect of those powers  the ability of central government to intervene would have been  limited. So we met them in respect of that. When it came to  the structures of government within provinces, there again we  were prepared to say that provinces need not adhere to the  provisions of the current constitution.    [Trudgeon] Joining us on the line now we have the  government's chief negotiator, Mr. Roelf Meyer. Good morning  Mr. Meyer, and thank you for your time. We are discussing this  issue of regionalism that seems such a stumbling block with the  IFP. We were talking to Walter Felgate a few moments ago. Do  you feel that the government has done enough in giving in on  this regionalism issue?    [Meyer] Well, it's not a question of giving in. It is what  we have negotiated. The problem is actually the fact that the  Freedom Alliance was not at Kempton Park at the Negotiating  Council where we have negotiated the contents of the  constitution, especially the IFP walked out of it on the 2d of  July last year already. And throughout the last part of last  year those parties that remained there negotiated exactly the  way in which provision should be made in a constitution for the  powers, functions and boundaries and so forth of the provinces  in the future.    And at those negotiations we took a particular viewpoint and  that is that we want autonomous provincial structures as far as  the future is concerned. So from government side that was our  view and that is what I believe we have attained. In other  words, we have succeeded in our goal as far as that goes through  the process of negotiations. Now what the Freedom Alliance is  actually wanting is something more, over and above what we have  already written into the constitution. First of all they missed  the opportunity while we were actually negotiating this already.  But now we have come up with specific proposals on how to  accommodate them as well and even at this late stage I would say  give us your specific proposals so that we can look at it and  see whether we can accommodate them. But you see, over the last  week, 10 days, two weeks, we have made further and further  compromises to accommodate them. In other words, we declared  ourselves prepared to make amendments to the constitution in  order to include them in the process. Now they want something  more, and if we can just get clarity on that, maybe we can find  a solution but then they have to provide us with that particular  proposal today.    [Trudgeon] Time is certainly running short, Mr. Meyer, just  how much more conciliatory are you going to be toward the  Freedom Alliance and what do you think still needs to be done to  get them in or what do you expect from them?    [Meyer] Well, the ball is in their court, in other words, to  provide us with their specific proposals. You see, the problem  is, we have from our side put the package on the table last  Thursday for consideration. After we had looked at the total  situation we said okay, look at the following proposal, and we  included in that a number of critical items according to the  wishes of the Freedom Alliance, as well including the two-ballot  paper issue and so forth. And then Monday evening when we met,  we heard from them that they would accept those proposals but  they want something more. And what we say to them -- what we've  said to them already Monday evening -- is give us a specific  proposal in terms of what you want more so that we can look at  that and see whether we can find an answer but the problem is,  you know, every time it seems that the solution is probably  coming, then new demands are being put, new goal posts are being  set and I think that is the problem that the Freedom Alliance  has internally because it is not a homogeneous organization. It  is an organization consisting of four or five different  components and each one has its own agenda almost. So that is  the problem, but time-wise there is still some scope. The point  is we would have preferred this all to have been concluded  before the proclamation of the election. That was done last  Wednesday. In terms of the Electoral Act, the time for  registration of parties lapses this Saturday. So that is  actually in a certain way the final moment because parties will  have to decide before Saturday whether they are going to  participate in the election. Of course if agreements can  finally be reached in the next two days, consequential  amendments flowing from those agreements can follow and of  course we would be too happy to give effect to such agreements,  but then we must get those agreement now over the next 48 hours.    [Trudgeon] Thank you Mr. Roelf Meyer who's the government's  chief negotiator. Mr. Dullah Omar, if you are still on the line  I should like to talk about the ANC's decision to register as a  political party today. Was this a unanimous decision and why  today specifically?    [Omar] Well, it is a unanimous decision. After all,  elections is [as heard] what the ANC has been fighting for for  so many years. There's no special significance in the day. We  have to register before Saturday, and so we want to make sure  that we have registered in time. I want to add that I hope that  the Freedom Alliance and its components or its components will  register for the elections. I don't think that the door to  negotiations will ever be closed, and on the side of the ANC  there will always be a preparedness to continue negotiating  right up to election day and even after elections.    [Trudgeon] So you feel confident perhaps that there's still  time to get the Freedom Alliance and the right wing in general  into the election process?    [Omar] Well, I want to say that we are open in that regard,  and the door to negotiations will never be closed.    [Trudgeon] Thank you, Mr. Dullah Omar, a spokesman for the  ANC on the line to Radio Today, and our thanks as well to Walter  Felgate and to chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Humber coal port project scrapped PLANS FOR Britain's largest coal import terminal have been abandoned after a row between Associated British Ports and PowerGen, one of two electricity generators involved in the Pounds 150m project. It was to have been built at Immingham on the Humber. Contracts for its construction were close to being awarded. Scheduled to open in 1994, the terminal would have posed a serious threat to British Coal by allowing generators to replace 10m tonnes a year of the 65m tonnes of coal now purchased from it annually. ABP, manager of the project, yesterday blamed cancellation on the refusal of one generator - understood to be PowerGen - to agree to sign final contracts this week. The other generator involved in the project is National Power. Sir Keith Stuart, ABP's chairman, said: 'We finally decided that enough was enough.' ABP has had parliamentary permission to develop the site since June 1990 and still wants to go ahead with the project for other dry goods. 'We have lost valuable time,' Sir Keith said. It was claimed yesterday that PowerGen had asked ABP to delay the final signing of the project until after the general election. 'The Labour party had a go at them and said they would let the terminal rot if they got in,' a senior coal industry executive said. 'PowerGen is not a big partner in the project, and they were prepared to hold off till after the election, but ABP forced the pace,' he said. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, said the Labour party had made it clear that the coal terminal would have been 'a white elephant' under a Labour government. PowerGen acknowledged it had not welcomed the political attention focused on the project, especially after it was disclosed last week that the contracts were about to be signed. The company stressed, however, that it had not agreed when the final signature would take place. 'Our negotiations on this deal were ongoing and we believe the action ABP has taken is precipitous,' the company said. PowerGen denied it lacked commitment to the terminal project, which it had itself initiated. National Power said ABP's decision was 'not in accordance with the company's wishes'. Both generators will now look at alternative import terminal projects. ABP will now seek other ways of developing the Immingham site. Because of lack of capacity at Immingham, many of ABP's existing customers would be interested in new facilities, ABP said. Irish Sea gas field project approved, Page 6</p>

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Defence spending likely to be cut THE Japanese government is close to agreeing the first cut in defence spending since the second world war, as part of the budget for next year, which should be finalised within 10 days. After weeks of intense negotiations a cabinet meeting tomorrow is likely to approve a cut of about Y600bn (Pounds 3.17bn) in a defence budget of about Y22,750bn. The cut is a triumph for the powerful Finance Ministry, which wants to reduce defence expenditure, in order to stimulate the economy by increasing investment in public works. The budget plan will be unveiled on December 26. The final negotiations over its contents are taking place this week. The cut in spending marks an abrupt change in Japanese policy in the wake of the cold war and reduced defence expenditure in the US and Europe. During most of the 1960s and 1970s Japanese defence spending rose by more than 10 per cent a year. In the past decade it has risen by about 5 per cent a year. The Finance Ministry argues the cuts are justified by the end of the cold war and a need to reduce expenditure to make up for a sharp fall in tax revenues brought on by the economic downturn. Public works spending is likely to rise by about 5 per cent, forming the centre-piece of an attempt to prevent the economy falling into outright recession. The defence agency has maintained that the rapid build-up in arms expenditure in the rest of Asia, particularly in South and North Korea and China, justifies continued increases in expenditure. Partly to compensate for the overall cut in the budget, the defence forces are likely to be given Y140bn to buy two Awacs early warning aircraft from the US. It is likely that overall public spending will rise only marginally, because the Finance Ministry opposes increased borrowing as a means of financing tax cuts or higher public spending. Social security and education expenditure are also likely to be curtailed. However, spending through the so-called second budget - the Fiscal Investment and Loan Programme - which is funded by savings deposited through the postal system, will rise by about 10 per cent. The government is expected to reintroduce tax incentives, withdrawn in 1988, aimed at stimulating the depressed property market. Increases in indirect taxes on liquor and cigarettes are unlikely in the light of stiff opposition from retailers, badly hit by the slump in consumer spending. It seems increasingly likely, though, that the government will consider cutting taxes next year.</p>

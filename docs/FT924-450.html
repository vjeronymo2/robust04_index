			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Computer whizz-kids take on teacher's role in classroom PARENTS worried about the baleful influence of Sonic the Hedgehog or Super Mario on their children's intellectual development may be surprised to find that computer whizz-kids are playing an important role in Britain's classrooms. Teachers are no less technologically challenged than the rest of the population who find setting the timer on a videocassette recorder a daunting task, according to a report published today by the schools inspectorate. As in the home, teachers turn to the younger generation for help and advice in using the increasingly sophisticated computer equipment. Hours spent with Sega or Nintendo games have created a new generation of 'pupil experts' at ease with the fast-developing world of computers. Schools are beginning to recognise that pupil experts can be great assets, helping other children, backing up teachers and managing school computer networks. 'The all-pervading influence of the new technology in their everyday lives has produced a generation of young people assured and relaxed in their approach to information technology,' the inspectors say. 'Pupils turn to IT without reticence or trepidation, unlike many of their elders.' Many teachers were 'brought up in the days when the notion of a 'smart' or intelligent machine would have been thought threatening', say the inspectors. They add: 'Girls are less likely than boys to be enthusiastic about information technology and are likely to assume less active roles if working with computers in mixed groups.' Some schools tackle this issue with lunchtime sessions or computers reserved for girls. The inspectors might do better to raise the issue with the Japanese software writers who tend to cast girls in passive roles. Princess Toadstool's only role is to await rescue by Mario and Luigi.

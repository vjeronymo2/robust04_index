			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under 45 CFR 100.8(a)(2), a SPOC has 60 days from the application due date to comment on proposed new or competing continuation awards. However, because PNS grant applications are due 30 days from the date of publication, and grants are to be awarded in September 1994, there is insufficient time to allow for a complete SPOC comment period. Therefore, we have reduced the comment period to 30 days from the closing date for applications. These comments are reviewed as part of the award process. Failure to notify the SPOC can result in delays in awarding grants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SPOCs are encouraged to eliminate the submission of routine endorsements as official recommendations. Additionally, SPOCs are requested to clearly differentiate between mere advisory comments and those official State process recommendation which may trigger the ``accommodate or explain'' rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When comments are submitted directly to ACF, they should be addressed to: Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children and Families, Division of Discretionary Grants, Sixth Floor, 370 L'Enfant Promenade SW., Washington, DC 20447, Attn: 93.631 ADD_Projects of National Significance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Contact information for each State's SPOC is found at the end of this Part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B.

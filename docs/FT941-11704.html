			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / BNF urges government to guarantee costs British Nuclear Fuels has told the government that it will be unable to secure Pounds 19bn of reprocessing contracts without a government guarantee against unexpected costs. The state-owned fuel reprocessing company has been trying for four years to conclude long-term deals to treat waste fuel from the UK's two nuclear power utilities. But Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear are refusing to agree unless the government protects them against unforeseen cost increases. In a section of the company's annual report yesterday headed 'fundamental uncertainty' the auditors Ernst &amp; Young said that if such government financial support were not to be obtained, 'the assumptions on which these accounts have been prepared would be rendered invalid'. The contracts hold the key to the future of BNF, which recently received the go-ahead to start its controversial Thorp reprocessing plant in Cumbria. Ernst &amp; Young, said that the company 'regards government financial support in the form of underwriting to be a prerequisite to the completion of these contracts'. The accounts were drawn up on the assumption of a government guarantee. The Department of Trade and Industry, which a year ago withdrew an earlier commitment to underwrite the contracts, said yesterday that it was considering BNF's request. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said it may challenge BNF's accounts on the basis that the government may not agree to the underwriting. The accounts also revealed that the year-long delay in approval for Thorp helped depress BNF's 1992-93 profits to less than half their previous year's level. BNF reported profits of Pounds 76m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 161m for the previous year. Turnover was marginally down at Pounds 1.05bn from Pounds 1.08bn. The results were at the lower end of analysts' expectations. The dividend to the government was halved to Pounds 26m. Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability in 1993-94 to be similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay playing an even greater role in the result. He said the Thorp effect last year was Pounds 18m but this year it would be about Pounds 90m. BNF said Thorp was not the only reason for the profit downturn. Profits had been depressed by Pounds 30m as a result of the nine-week shutdown in 1992 of Magnox reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria. A further Pounds 40m was an advance writedown of costs associated with the merger of BNF's enrichment assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a company, Urenco. Restructuring costs were put at Pounds 20m.</p>

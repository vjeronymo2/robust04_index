			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / UK Company News: GPT gets payphone boost from Venezuela GPT, the UK telecom-munications manufacturing subsidiary of GEC and Siemens, has won a Pounds 9m payphones contract from Venezuela, taking payphone orders from Latin America to more than Pounds 30m in the past year. Latin America, a rapidly growing market for GPT's payphones division, is expected to help lift the division's sales from Pounds 82m last year to more than Pounds 90m this year. With the latest order GPT will have supplied more than 80,000 phones to the continent. The Venezuela contract, awarded by the country's privatised telephone company against strong competition from Japanese suppliers, is for additional payphones - card and multi-payment variants - together with a national cashless calling systems and the expansion of the existing payphone management system. It follows a Pounds 12.5m contract won last October, as part of Venezuela's programme of upgrading its public phone network. GPT manufactures its new generation of 'intelligent' payphones, which accept credit cards and smart cards with microcomputers embedded within them, at its plant in Chorley, Lancashire. GPT now supplies payphones and associated management systems to 60 countries.</p>

The congress' headquarters told Interfax that the Chechen  clans had put off their congress for a second time "to avoid  bloodshed" after commander of the Shali tank regiment Saifutdin  Isayev agreed to fulfil the president's order to open fire at  the delegates and their supporters if the congress took place.    Earlier, Isayev had supported the idea of organizing such a  congress and promised to block the city in order to prevent the  president's armed supporters from penetrating into it. "We have  put off the congress because we cannot leave the delegates and  local population unprotected," said member of the clans'  Council Mansur Tagirov. "No one expected Isayev to change his  mind so radically," he added.    The Council's headquarters announced that the delegates  would  be informed of the date and place of the congress a few hours  before its opening to prevent the Chechen leaders from sending  troops to the place before the congress took the decision on  organizing parliamentary elections next April.</p>

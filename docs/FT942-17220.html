			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / Observer: Who is Silvio? Silvio is obviously a man to watch. No, not Berlusconi, but the Brazilian Silvio Santos, who, like his Italian namesake, hopes to realise his political ambitions. Apart from the lack of a football club, the two are remarkably alike. The Brazilian version comes from a poor family and has built up one of the country's newest and most dynamic TV companies, SBT, now second only to Brazil's mighty Globo in terms of viewer figures. This success owed a great deal to sensationalist programming, such as investigations of gory murders and suicides. But Santos remains a star attraction, hosting a marathon Sunday night game show in which one of his catch phrases is 'Who wants money?' as he throws Cr5,000 (Dollars 5) bills into the largely female audience. Despite Santos' ambitions, and his likely appeal among the country's many poor, polls show that he is getting less than 5 per cent of voting intentions for October's presidential elections. If he cannot persuade more viewers that he is a serious politician as well as a cash dispenser, he may just have to lower his ambitions and run for Congress instead.</p>

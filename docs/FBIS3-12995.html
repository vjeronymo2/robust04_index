			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hebron Evacuation on the Agenda"] </F>   [Text] In yesterday's cabinet meeting, many ministers  proclaimed their support for the evacuation of the Hebron  settlers, but a cabinet resolution, which is needed in principle  as well as for tactical purposes, was never endorsed. The  Likud, the NRP [National Religious Party], and Moledet are  opposed to the evacuation. Moreover, the Tzomet faction, which  the prime minister would like to include in the coalition, is  "adamantly" opposed to it. There is a polarization of views  even in Labor, where Ministers Shetrit and Tzur contest the  issue with the doves of the Mashov circle.    Our political situation would have been less calamitous had  the government removed the 42 settler families and the 150  yeshiva students from their houses, which are located in the  heart of the Arab city, right after the Cave of the Patriarchs  massacre and settled them temporarily in Qiryat Arba'.    U.S. and UN representatives have informed the Arabs -- the  Muslims and the PLO -- that they will not allow the Security  Council to denounce Israel. The United States will not agree to  anything other than a denunciation of the massacre itself.  Furthermore, it is not looking forward to sending UN troops to  territories administered by Israel. It will be another week  before we know for certain whether the United States is a  consistent champion of the stand taken by Israel, which agreed  to a temporary international or outside presence "to be agreed  on" in the Gaza Strip and the Jericho area only.    Since the crime was committed outside Gaza and Jericho, the  argument that the United States should "protect the safety of  the Palestinians" -- namely, everybody -- carries some weight.  The removal of Jews from Hebron will not satisfy all the  anti-Israel demands, which have been aired by exploiting the  Security Council as a platform, but it can attenuate their  magnitude.    Beyond the problem that has arisen in the UN arena, the  permanent Jewish presence in Hebron hampers the PLO's  performance in the peace process. Yasir 'Arafat was willing to  come to Washington in response to President Clinton's  invitation, but he was unable to act on his wishes, and the  peace process was discontinued as a result of the majority  opinion in the PLO-Tunis directorate. If the Israeli Government  wants the PLO leader to be able to impose his authority on his  organization and on the Palestinian population in the West Bank  and the Gaza Strip, it should make a move of its own.    Knesset Member [MK] Eliyahu Ben-Elisar has warned against  evacuating the Hebron settlers because it might constitute a  precedent for the removal of all the settlements; MK Rehav'am  Ze'evi sees the evacuation of Hebron as "the first step toward  the annihilation of the Zionist endeavor"; and one settler  described the renewed Jewish settlement in Hebron as "the  rectifying of old wrongs against the Jews."    They should all be told that Israel did not engage in the  Six-Day War in order to take land; the victory should not have  been used to annul our historical consent to the partition of  the country in 1947. Settling accounts with the Hebron Arabs of  1968 for the crimes their fathers committed in 1929 was a  mistake to begin with, and it is certainly a mistake to  perpetuate in 1994 an error made 26 years earlier.    Israel does not need a permanent Jewish presence in Hebron  for security or any other reason; all it does is cause severe  damage. The glory of the Jewish people's spiritual heritage does  not lie in the presence of a handful of Jewish families in a few  houses owned by Jews in the distant past. The IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] has tasks other than maintaining a vast  deployment to protect that handful and stop it from provoking  the Arab residents of the city.</p>

			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Chunnel link needs bold move Sir, There can be no doubt that the planned high-speed rail link between the Channel tunnel and London could be a showpiece for the government's initiative of attracting private capital to public infrastructure projects ('Chunnel link', October 29). We believe it is important for the government to come up with a scheme for introducing private sector entrepreneurial skills, management disciplines and capital into this transport infrastructure project at an early stage. In October 1991, the secretary of state announced the government's preference for the route on the lines put forward by Ove Arup &amp; Partners; this was a route approaching central London from an easterly direction. At the same time he requested British Rail to develop this route to a standard at which he could safeguard it. The route corridor has now been identified and largely accepted through a successful public consultation process carried out over the past six months by Union Railways, a subsidiary of British Rail. For the high-speed rail link to progress without delay now requires some kind of joint venture between the private and the public sectors along the lines outlined by the Treasury in its March 1993 guidance notes. This has to be the most appropriate vehicle for the government to take the project forward through its parliamentary process. Such an arrangement would require the government to shoulder the political risks and the private sector participant to develop the business aspects. These would include proposals for full financing and would include the form and amount of the public sector contribution. All the project risks other than the political ones could be carried by the joint venture. The government's equity interest would be disposed of at the time of full financing after Royal Assent. The challenge facing the Treasury is to devise a method for selecting an effective and credible private sector participant which would create strong ownership of the project with the government. Such a venture should be put in place now as the project goes to parliament in March 1994. Without a bold initiative, doubt will remain about the effectiveness of the government's intention of attracting private capital to public infrastructure projects.

Japan, going against the international trend toward detente,  is accelerating its conversion into a military power and its  nuclear armament and overseas expansion, thus coming to the fore  as a new dangerous hotbed of war, the author of the article  says, and goes on:    Japan is pursuing the policy of strength behind the  post-cold  war scene. This is fully illustrated by the fact that the  war-thirsty elements of Japan are making desperate efforts to  establish a social system for a war of aggression.    The Japanese rightwing conservative forces are scheming to  revise the Constitution, while building up the "Self-Defence  Forces" [SDF] into one of the leading aggression forces in the  world through the systematic increase of military expenditures  every year.    Japan rattled "the bill on cooperation in the United Nations  peacekeeping operation" through the Diet to legalize the  overseas dispatch of the "SDF." Now it intends to create legal  conditions for a war of aggression, crying for "the revision of  the SDF law" and "the study and enactment of the law on the  event of contingency."    The nature of Japan as a new war force is glaringly revealed  in its crackbrained rush for the building of a military power  and its nuclear armament.    Japan is far higher than any other Western countries in the  rate of the increase of military expenditures. Now it has  reached the second topmost rung on the global ladder of military  spendings.    The Japanese reactionaries are hastening at break-neck speed  the increase of the fire power of the "SDF," its high-tech  equipment and attainment of greater mobility and buildup of  long-range operation capacity with stress on the qualitative  reinforcement of the "SDF", not leaning too much to quantitative  growth.    Getting mad over overseas aggression, the Japanese  militarists have reshaped the defensive structure of the "SDF"  into an offensive one, adopted a forestalling-attack strategy in  place of the "defence-oriented strategy" and expanded the  operational sphere into extensive regions of Northeast Asia and  the Pacific.    It is nobody's secret that Japan's nuclear armament is near  completion and its nuclear range will cover every part of the  globe in the future.    Japan, which appeared on the scene as a new war force, is  now  following in the footsteps of its defunct militarists who faced  a stern judgment by history after launching into aggression  under the cloak of "peace of the East."    The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful  that their policy of aggression and war will lead them to  destruction.</p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Berlin N-TV in German at 1010 GMT on 22  June carried a live relay of the 77-minute speech delivered by  Rudolf Scharping, leader of the Social Democratic Party of  Germany [SPD] to the SPD congress in Halle.    Scharping opened his speech by commenting on the huge  expectations from the speech itself, regarded by some as the  make-or-break speech for Scharping. He then stressed his  support for the people of eastern Germany and strongly  criticized the effects of 12 years of Kohl's rule on the people  throughout Germany, particularly with regard to the welfare  state. He said that following the defeat in the European  elections the party has to fight more clearly and resolutely  than before. He stressed that he is determined to win the  election rather than come in second.    Scharping congratulated those who contributed to German  unity, including the east European states. Referring to the  achievement of the Social Democrats under Willy Brandt with  regard to East-West relations, he stressed that Germany needs a  new policy of the people and must take its international role  seriously, bringing the people of Europe closer together.    Scharping then moved on to the subject of coalitions saying  that his party intends to concentrate on its own policies and  not on coalition speculation. He said that environmental,  economic, and social policies must be considered in tandem and  his party is not content to hand responsibility for one of these  areas to, for example, the Greens. He then emphasized that he  will seek to shake off his reputation for being characterless.    Moving onto the subject of taxes, he reiterated that high  earners should not complain about high taxes and should never  forget the poor. He said his party must go on the offensive and  remove Helmut Kohl from government. Appealing to the east  Germans never to forget what Kohl has done to them, he accused  Kohl of deceiving people about the state of the economy and  appealed to the people of the east not to vote for the Party of  Democratic Socialism out of disillusionment. He added that his  party wants an economic upswing, but not false optimism.    Stressing that his party wants tax exemption for those  living  on the poverty line, he said that the government has sacrificed  people for the sake of competitiveness. Any upswing has to be  accompanied by sound environmental policies and has to be in the  interest of all. He added that the right wing will not be  allowed to flourish under the SPD and condemned attacks on  foreigners.    In conclusion, he stressed that the SPD wants a unified  Germany that is strong economically, has good ecological  policies, and lives up to its responsibilities to Europe and the  world.    Scharping received a standing ovation at the end of his  speech.</p>

			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Focus on the Yen CONCERN over the Yen ahead of Saturday's meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors is expected to be one of the focal points for financial markets this week, writes Peter John. The conference will be the first of the G7 policymakers since President Clinton took office on January 20. It is expected to examine ways to help the world economy and particularly to rein in Japan's soaring trade surplus. Press meetings given by the Japanese finance and economic planning ministers on Tuesday and Friday will offer clues to the path the G7 meeting will take. The fall in German M3 money supply announced on Friday and comments by Mr Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, are also likely to act as financial market motors. Most economists have seen Germany's 2.3 per cent contraction in money supply as a technical correction - the result of rebasing the figures on the fourth quarter of last year when there was an unusually heavy level of intervention. However, some still argue that it augurs well for an easing of monetary policy some time after the next Bundesbank meeting on March 4. On the other hand the comments made in Mr Greenspan's testimony to Congress signalled a tightening of monetary policy. At the very least it removed the possibility of easing rates, a threat which has hit the US currency in the past week. Mr David Deakin, the economist for Nikko Bank says: 'If German rates are likely to fall and if the American rates are less likely to fall the dollar/D-Mark is likely to rise.' Meanwhile, the market will continue to watch the performance of the Spanish peseta and the Swedish Krona which have been propped up by intervention from their respective central banks. In the UK, money is expected to be tighter this week as a result of a large amount of short-term loans expiring and needing to be rolled over.</p>

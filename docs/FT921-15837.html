			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Personal View: Tax reforms - from the absurd to the ridiculous The suggestion by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, that Labour would raise the basic rate of income tax to 35 per cent is absurd. Mr Lamont's team tried to identify and cost all the public service aims of the Labour party, and came up with Pounds 35bn. The Treasury team then estimated that Labour could raise Pounds 10bn from a new top rate of income tax of 50p and the abolition of the National Insurance ceiling. That left a Pounds 25bn gap to be filled by a 10 per cent increase in the basic rate of income tax. It may be that Pounds 35bn is what Labour's additional desired spending would cost, but there is no suggestion that they would increase spending by that amount immediately. The shadow chancellor John Smith and his team have repeatedly said they would only spend as the economy grew and provided additional resources. The Tories' own desires look quite expensive: they want to spend Pounds 20bn on cutting public sector borrowing to zero, and a further Pounds 12.5bn on cutting the basic rate of income tax to 20 per cent. The Tory wish list adds up to Pounds 32.5bn, not much less than Pounds 35bn. Labour would not raise the basic rate by 10p, but neither could the party deliver enormous increases in public spending. The Conservatives could not cut taxes and borrowing in the short term. The speed with which either party could achieve its aim depends almost entirely on the rate at which the economy grows. Coming closer to sensible debate, Labour has made some spending commitments for the first year of a new parliament, to increase child benefit and the state retirement pension. These increases would cost about Pounds 4bn a year. To pay for these benefit changes, Labour proposes the abolition of the National Insurance ceiling, and the new 50 per cent top-rate tax. The abolition of the NI ceiling would hit everyone earning more than Pounds 20,280. As yet, Labour has been vague about where the new 50 per cent tax rate will be imposed, but gross earnings of about Pounds 40,000 a year seem a reasonable assumption. The table illustrates the impact of these tax changes at various income levels. The clearest point to emerge is that the National Insurance change is far more important than the new top income tax rate. Almost 4m people would lose from the National Insurance reform; only about 750,000 from the new income tax rate. And even at an income of Pounds 100,000 a year the loss from the NI rise exceeds that from the additional income tax. Far too much attention has been paid to income tax, and too little to the NI proposals. These two changes are of radically different types: the income tax increase is a simple piece of redistributive taxation, the NI proposal a long overdue reform of an anomalous and unfair tax. But the NI structure has become so anomalous and unfair that to remove the ceiling in one Budget may be not only politically risky, but also objectively too rapid a change. By the middle of 1991-92, average full-time male non-manual earnings had reached the NI ceiling of Pounds 20,280. We now have a system where the tax rate on those earning below this level is higher at 34 per cent (combined income tax of 25 per cent and NI of 9 per cent) than on those above-average earnings facing 25 per cent tax plus a smaller NI percentage. The NI system is a disgrace of which the government should be ashamed. Labour should be congratulated for recognising the problem, and being prepared to tackle it. But the immediate abolition of the ceiling would impose losses of poll tax and higher proportions on 4m voters. If Labour did not need the money to pay for its benefit promises, it would make more sense to phase in this reform. Even now, it might be possible to move to such a proposal, retaining the credit for equitable and efficient tax reform without imposing such large losses on voters near the middle of the income distribution. Taxation may be a vital part of the pre-election debate, but thus far the main parties have contributed little to that debate. The Conservatives try to hide the increase in the tax burden since 1979 - and their lack of any strategy for the tax system as a whole - behind cuts in income tax rates. They also make silly accusations about what would happen to the basic rate of tax if Labour were elected. Although the Pounds 35bn accusation is ridiculous, Labour does seem to have too many 'priorities', given its limited intentions for raising more money. Its proposals on income tax continue to be vague, and it still tries to pass off its laudable NI reform as one which will only hit those on very high incomes.

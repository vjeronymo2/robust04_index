			<p><P> November 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST COVINA MOVES TO REQUIRE CITY PERMIT TO CUT DOWN TREES  </P> <P> Last May, a developer mowed down 30 oak trees along Oak Canyon Road. The City  Council wants to make sure that it doesn't happen again.  </P> <P> The council gave preliminary approval Monday to an ordinance requiring permits  for removing or pruning most trees. The final vote will be Nov. 12.  </P> <P> The new law would require a resident to get a permit from the city to remove a  tree whose trunk is at least one foot in diameter in a front yard or side yard  facing the street. In addition, the tree would have to be relocated or  replaced.  </P> <P> Even stricter rules would apply to oak and sycamore trees: Permits would be  required to remove or prune trees whose trunks are at least six inches in  diameter.  </P> <P> The new law would stop developers from cutting down historic trees, said Tina  Daniels, former president of the West Covina Historical Society.  </P> <P> If adopted, it would replace a citywide moratorium that has prohibited removal  of oak, walnut, sycamore and pepper trees since the May incident.  </P> <P> Pat Haley, West Covina's planning director, said the ordinance provides that  violators can be fined up to $1,000 or sentenced to six months' imprisonment,  or both.

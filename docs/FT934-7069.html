			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Regulator may heed funding demand: Societies demand reform to boost competition on rates to potential borrowers Mrs Rosalind Gilmore, Building Societies Commissioner, has raised the prospect that powers in the de-regulation bill now before parliament could be used to allow societies to raise more of their funds on the wholesale money markets, enabling them to be more competitive. Mrs Gilmore said there was 'no huge magic' about the present limit of 40 per cent of funds which societies can raise on the wholesale markets, set by the Building Societies Act 1986. Below this overall ceiling, each society has a different limit. The average is about 30 per cent. 'If it became a really serious pressure point and you could think about doing it as a stand-alone measure, I suppose one would think about it. It might be possible under the de-regulation bill,' Mrs Gilmore said. Competition in the retail financial sector both for savings and for mortgage lending has been particularly tough this year. Societies have suffered some months of net outflows of funds and the banks have steadily increased their share of mortgage lending. Larger societies want greater access to wholesale funds, where borrowing is cheaper, in order to be able to offer more attractive deals to potential borrowers. 'It's about being able to give our members the most favourable rates,' said one chief executive. An overall limit of 50 per cent would imply lower individual limits for societies, thus ensuring that they retained their character as mutual institutions. Mr John Wriglesworth, societies analyst at UBS, said such a move should mean that customers were offered better mortgage deals as competition increased. Mrs Gilmore's readiness to consider the use of deregulation powers is a sign of how she interprets her role. She said: 'I think it's about wanting building societies to be successful and doing whatever we can through the regulatory system to see that they are, which means responding so far as the act allows to their wish to diversify and change and move with the market in a prudent kind of way.' Further evidence of the commission's desire to be flexible comes from its development of a system in which it makes generic regulations enabling societies to move into areas of activity, such as money transmission, rather than individual orders, each dealing with a specific scheme. In spite of such initiatives, however, some of the larger societies believe the commission has a tendency to 'nanny' the sector. In particular, a recent draft prudential note on lending policy has been criticised for being too detailed and prescriptive. Mrs Gilmore admitted that it was not easy to devise guidance that applied sensibly to the whole of the industry. That means from Halifax, the UK's largest society - with assets of more than Pounds 60bn - to some local societies which have only one or two branches. She argued that the draft note on lending contains a mix of requirements which the societies must fulfil and guidance about how to do so, but hinted at a re-packaging of the advice to make this clear. 'If that's being sensed differently by the market, if that's causing confusion, then obviously we'll look at it'. In spite of the over-capacity in retail financial services, and the lack of immediate external pressures on societies to merge, the commission is widely seen as hostile to the idea of banks, or even life companies, acquiring societies. Mrs Gilmore said she had nothing in principle against such mergers, but admitted that the part of the 1986 Act which provided for such moves was difficult to interpret. Apart from the overwhelming support which is required from a society's members - its savers and borrowers - there is an added complication if the offer is made in terms of cash rather than shares because cash cannot be distributed to members of less than two years' standing. She argued that the commission was bound to supervise such matters closely. That was because the commission had to strike down the deal if a member could show that he or she had not been properly informed before the vote. Beyond what might be accomplished through the de-regulation bill, Mrs Gilmore does not believe there will be significant legislation for the building society sector until the next parliament at the earliest, though she does expect societies to want to move beyond the current restrictions before the end of the century. That legislation will, she believes, raise fundamental questions about the nature of building societies, which the societies themselves will have to consider further: how far do they want to retain their distinctive character with its advantages and restrictions in a market of intensifying competition and pressures to diversify? 'I think the interesting questions about next act are what it is to be a membership organisation and how wide you let the remit go. At the extreme, you do come to the view that the next act could just be about a category of mutual banks,' she said.</p>

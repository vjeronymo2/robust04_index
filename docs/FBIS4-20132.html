			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["sm"-signed report: "Opportunities for Submarine Order"] </F>   [Text] Taipei -- According to information that  HANDELSBLATT received in Taiwan, the country is to get German  submarines through cooperation with U.S. firms. The total order  will be in the range of 10 billion German marks [DM].  Apparently, the supply of submarines to Taiwan is to open the  door for selling a German ICE [Intercity Express] high-speed  train worth DM30 billion to the Chinese island republic. Direct  supply of submarines to Taiwan, but not cooperation, had been  prohibited by the Federal Security Council in Bonn.  HANDELSBLATT has been told that the U.S. Congress is expected  to amend the Taiwan Act in the near future to create the legal  possibilities in the United States for supplying the submarines  produced jointly by German and U.S. firms.</p>

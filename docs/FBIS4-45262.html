			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 31 May (AFP) -- Today, the local  newspaper EL TIEMPO indicated that the Colombian Government  expects an explanation from the United States for its sudden  decision to suspend the operation of two radars installed in  Colombia to detect drug planes. This followed the publication  of the U.S. decision by the THE WASHINGTON POST on 29 May.    According to EL TIEMPO, government spokespersons referred to  Washington's decision as "inconsiderate, untimely, unilateral,  and rude." THE WASHINGTON POST said that the Pentagon ordered  the suspension of the operation of four radars used in the fight  against drug trafficking, which are located in Colombia and  Peru. In Colombia, the radars are located in Araracuara and  Leticia, in the southeastern Department of Amazonas.    According to EL TIEMPO, since 1 May, the U.S. soldiers who  operate the radars stopped briefing the Colombian Air Force on  the flights detected. EL TIEMPO adds that the U.S. Government  has not officially notified its Colombian counterpart of its  decision. The Colombian Government asked Washington for an  explanation 28 days ago, but thus far, it has not received a  reply, EL TIEMPO discloses. The newspaper also reveals that a  government spokesperson stated that "it is obvious that if the  radars are not working, it makes no sense to keep them and the  technicians on Colombian territory."</p>

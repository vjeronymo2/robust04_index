			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (5): Wanted - a watchdog with real teeth THE TRANSFORMATION OF THREADNEEDLE STREET by James J. Fishman Carolina Academic Press, Dollars 39.95, 301 pages SOME SEVEN years after the Stock Exchange's 'Big Bang' and the roughly contemporaneous passage of the Financial Services Act 1986 the regulation of Britain's financial services industry remains troubled. Several high-profile prosecutions for fraud have failed, and the regulatory structure for the investment industry developed under the FSA is plainly not yet in its final shape. James Fishman, Professor of Law at Pace University, offers the expert outsider's view. His interest was aroused while he was a visiting lecturer at University College, London, in 1986. The valuable contribution of the foreigner is to add an international perspective to what can be a blinkered and introverted debate. Unfortunately, the author sometimes shows a slightly uncertain grasp of the British scene, not least in the title: he does not appear to realise that the Threadneedle Street connection relates purely to the Bank of England rather than to the broader financial services industry. Irritatingly, too, the map on the front of the dust jacket manages to misspell Moorgate, one of the City of London's most famous streets. One of the basic themes - the conflict between the 1980s desire to deregulate the markets, yet at the same time to improve investor protection - is insufficiently developed. However, the author has certainly done his homework. He discusses with some sympathy the development of financial services regulation in the UK in the 1980s, but his final criticisms are fairly devastating. Regulation of retail investment products such as life assurance should have remained the responsibility of a separate body, he says, as was the case right at the beginning before the Marketing of Investments Board Organising Committee was rolled up into the Securities and Investments Board in early 1986. The SIB itself should focus upon enforcement, which he regards as the main area of concern. 'Unless the enforcement approach is changed, the next boom cycle in the financial markets will demonstrate the system's fatal weakness,' he warns. Early on there were lengthy battles between the proponents of self-regulation - the preferred British approach - and those who wanted a stronger element of statutory regulation on the lines of that implemented by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. There was in the event great reliance on self-regulatory organisations, but things began to go wrong. Sir Kenneth Berrill, the first SIB chairman, failed to build a consensus through dialogue, says Mr Fishman. A monstrous rule-book of 430 pages weighing over 4lb had been built up by 1987. The Department of Trade and Industry under Norman Tebbit and Paul Channon appeared to favour a highly restrictive rulemaking approach, and the abrupt reversal of this under Lord Young after the 1987 election did not entirely redeem the situation. Berrill imposed apparently arbitrary policy choices; the introduction of polarisation for retail investment products was done even though 'SIB had not a clue as to the impact of such a change on the life insurance industry's structure.' Young allowed Berrill's contract to lapse in May 1988 and replaced him with the more communicative and sympathetic David Walker, an executive director of the Bank. During Walker's four-year chairmanship there was progress in developing slightly more user-friendly rules, and tempers cooled. However, the retail side of regulation remains in a serious mess, to the extent that the third chairman, Andrew Large, has declared the need for a 'step change' in the standard of regulation in this area. James Fishman says that one of the big problems has been the inability of the SIB to differentiate sufficiently between the wholesale and retail markets. In the former, unnecessary disclosure has increased transaction costs and created grievances. But in the latter disclosure is essential to correct substantial informational asymmetries between buyers and sellers. His proposed solutions are drastic and, it has to be said, rather muddled. He recommends that a separate retail investment oversight body should be hived off, on the general lines of the MIB. The Bank of England itself should take on general oversight responsibility for financial services regulation. The SIB itself should focus on enforcement across a wide area of fraud. 'There is a desperate need for a full-time cadre of mostly career employees to investigate and prosecute securities fraud,' he argues. Perhaps so, but he fails to make the case convincingly. There is little discussion, for example, of the implications for the Serious Fraud Office or the Fraud Investigation Group. He also appears ignorant of the extent to which the Bank of England has been damaged by the BCCI affair. However, Mr Fishman casts valuable fresh light on the continuing contradictions within the British framework of financial regulation. Changes there will have to be, even if not necessarily along precisely these lines.</p>

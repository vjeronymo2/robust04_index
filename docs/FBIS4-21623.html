			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The Ministry of  International Trade and Industry (MITI) said Wednesday [6 April]  there were 17 reported cases of problems and accidents involving  Japan's nuclear power plants in fiscal 1993, down three from the  previous fiscal year.    On average, the number of problems and accidents per plant  in  operation stood at a low of 0.3 for the year. There were 46  nuclear power plants in operation in 1993.    The ministry's Agency of Natural Resources and Energy is  required to report all serious incidents under the electricity  enterprises act.    MITI also listed seven instances of less serious problems  that are by law not required to be reported.    Breaking down serious accidents, agency officials said there  were 10 cases in which reactors were shut down manually and  seven instances in which damage was found during periodic  reactor checks.    There were no reported automatic shutdowns, in which the  emergency core cooling system shuts down the reactor, the most  important safety mechanism to prevent nuclear accidents.    The officials also said operating rates for the nation's  nuclear power plants averaged 75.4 percent in fiscal 1993 ended  on March 31.    It was the 11th straight year the average operating rate  topped the 70 percent mark.</p>

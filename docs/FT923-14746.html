			<p>920706 FT  06 JUL 92 / Management (GEC At The Crossroads): Who's who in choosing a successor THE FAVOURITE: David Newlands The 45-year-old Scottish finance director fills the shoes of Sir Kenneth Bond, Lord Weinstock's right-hand man during the the 1960s. He is being groomed for the top. He used to work for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the advertising agency, and became closely acquainted with GEC as the accountant at Touche Ross handling its accounts. Mr Newlands has taken an increasingly high profile at budget meetings. Institutional shareholders like him. THE DEPUTY: Malcolm Bates He works in the adjoining office to Lord Weinstock, often negotiating the detail of contracts and acquisitions. The stockily built 58-year-old became Lord Weinstock's deputy in 1983, but is thought unlikely to succeed him. He was managing director of Delta, the British engineering group, before joining Labour's Industrial Reorganisation Corporation in the late 1960s. He joined GEC in 1976. Studied at Harvard and Warwick University before going into industry. THE CENTRI Ron Artus The 60-year-old former group chief investment manager of the Prudential, GEC's largest shareholder, joined the board in 1990. He will play a pivotal role in deciding the succession, liaising between the board and shareholders. Analytical and independent, he shares Lord Weinstock's interest in classical music, collects English watercolours and is a lifelong cricket fan. THE SCION: Simon Weinstock Lord Weinstock's 40-year-old son looks more like his father the older he gets. He shares his intense shyness and his interest in horse racing. Joined GEC in 1983 as commercial manager, having held a range of jobs with SG Warburg, the merchant bank. Joined board in 1987 and is renowned for his work rate. THE POLITICIAN: Lord Prior Born in Suffolk, Lord Prior served in the army in India and Germany before becoming MP for Lowestoft in 1959. Approachable and relaxed, he will be central in managing the succession.</p>

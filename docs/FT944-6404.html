			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Cabinet backs Berlusconi Italian prime minister Mr Silvio Berlusconi last night headed off a break with his coalition partner, the populist Northern League, by winning limited approval for a document outlining the main objectives of the six-month-old right-wing coalition. The move followed threats by Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, to pull out of the coalition once the 1995 budget had passed through parliament. The document, prepared by Mr Berlusconi over the weekend and presented at yesterday's cabinet meeting, centred on plans to create a more decentralised administrative structure, deferring to the League's demands for greater federalism. Other elements included acceleration of the reform of public administration, a shake-up of the justice system and the introduction of anti-trust laws to avoid the prime minister's conflict of interest with his Fininvest business empire. The cabinet session also gave Mr Berlusconi authority to negotiate an agreement on pensions with the trade unions - but keeping reform of the pension system inside the 1995 budget legislation. The talks with the unions will be held today in an effort to avert their plan for a general strike on Friday in protest against the budget.</p>

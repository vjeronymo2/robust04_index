			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Yeltsin calls for sacking of political adversary THE BATTLE for Russian political supremacy intensified yesterday when President Boris Yeltsin called on parliament to sack his chief rival, parliamentary speaker Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov. Efforts to effect a truce between the two men seemed close to collapse after Mr Khasbulatov, canvassing for support among local council leaders in western Siberia, mocked President Yeltsin for playing games with the fate of Russia. In a highly personal attack, Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's spokesman, urged parliament to consider firing its speaker. Mr Khasbulatov had broken a gentleman's agreement to refrain from public polemics while the two leaders tried to negotiate a constitutional truce, the spokesman said. 'It is becoming clear that Khasbulatov is increasingly discrediting himself as a party in negotiations, as a politician one can do business with in Russia.' Mr Kostikov also accused Mr Khasbulatov of currying favour with arch-conservatives and said he was responsible for the country's constitutional instability. The latest exchange confirms the near impossibility of the two former allies resolving what has become an intensely personal struggle with deep significance for the entire country. Mr Yeltsin is fighting to stop the erosion of his powers by parliament. The two rivals agreed on Tuesday to seek a formula for dividing power between the executive and legislature. Mr Yeltsin appeared on television proposing a division of powers that would confine parliament to examining and passing legislation and give the executive the freedom to take executive decisions, but Mr Khasbulatov rejected the proposal. He stressed that under the still-functioning communist constitution, the parliament was 'the highest organ of power' and that any successor body should remain so. At yesterday's meeting in Novosibirsk, Mr Khasbulatov attacked the president for threatening to press ahead with a constitutional referendum. 'I regret we haven't seen any concrete proposals from the president. . . it's time to end this game. If he wants a referendum, then let's have one. If he doesn't want one, he should say so.' The president's frequently expressed opinion that the full parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, was incapable of adopting a new constitution was a 'primitive conclusion'. He also said the country did not urgently need a new constitution. Nobody's a nice guy now, Page 9</p>

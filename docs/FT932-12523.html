			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Management: From coal mine to chicken litter - Job prospects for pit managers As an employee of British Coal for 22 years, Ian Clayton never expected to work with any fuel other than that which had fired an industrial revolution and countless imaginations. He was wrong; last week he started a new job as the manager of an electricity-generating plant where the raw material is chicken litter, a combination of wood shavings and excreta. 'It may not be everyone's idea of fun but I am enjoying it and I feel the future is secure here,' he says. Clayton, 45, is one of a growing number of British Coal pit managers who are opting out of the industry as they see the number of pits declining and their job prospects reduce with them. Compared with face workers and other less skilled British Coal employees, pit managers are finding jobs, if not easily then with less of a struggle. Finding jobs for senior staff is a relatively new problem for British Coal. Although it has been shrinking for many years, it has been able to shed staff voluntarily through relatively generous redundancy packages. But earlier retrenchments mean that most candidates for early retirement, which becomes available when employees reach 50, have already gone. The destinations of those departing are surprisingly varied. They include teaching, general management and consultancy work. Many have increased their salaries, not surprising given that the average salary for a pit manager, in charge of perhaps 800 staff, is less than Pounds 50,000. British Coal departees often feel a sense of release from an employer which offers only limited career opportunities because of its contraction. Take 36-year-old Kevin Whiteman, who left his job as manager of Frickley pit in February to become southern region manager for the National Rivers Authority. The problem at British Coal, he says, was not so much lack of security even though the pit he managed is only reprieved from closure if British Coal can find a market for its coal. 'I was concerned about the shortage of opportunities,' says Whiteman. 'I had been a pit manager for the best part of eight years and I could see few places to go within British Coal. The management challenges here are very similar - general management is general management.' The NRA job was the first Whiteman had applied for and, says Peter Humphreys, personnel director, he beat 300 other applicants for the appointment. 'We wanted someone whose qualities and experience included financial control, an engineering and management background, and a well-defined knowledge of operating with high public visibility. Kevin was the outstanding candidate.' Clayton, former manager at British Coal's Silverhill pit, contested with a smaller field of candidates to win his job as manager of the Fibropower chicken litter power station in Eye, Suffolk. The 65 contenders, though, included senior employees of National Power power stations. Nor was Clayton the only coal industry candidate to impress. Three British Coal employees made it to the final interview stage. That does not surprise Philip Andrew, chief executive at British Coal Enterprise. It is his job to find work for British Coal employees who want to move on, so he is hardly likely to run down their abilities, but he is frank about some of their potential deficiencies. 'If you asked a pit manager to go to the City for debt funding to deal with working capital he would not know what you were talking about,' he says. 'But they are very much aware of profit and their general management skills are strong. We are talking about people who handle 700 to 800 personnel and a business turning over Pounds 40m a year. Many managing directors of publicly quoted companies have less on their plate than that.'</p>

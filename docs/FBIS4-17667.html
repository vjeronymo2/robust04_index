			<p>BFN     [Text] There was a press conference today at the Crimean  Council of Ministers. Acting Minister of State Affairs Viktor  Minin answered questions. He is one of the Russian specialists  that have come to the Crimean Government together with Yevgeniy  Saburov.    The main directions of the government's activities are  already outlined. These comprise urgent reforms of the economy.  Ukraine, in spite of strained political relations with Crimea,  does not hinder these reforms and is ready to help in certain  aspects. In any case, the policy of an open economy in Crimea  is being set up in accordance with Leonid Kravchuk's decree.    For the reforms to be successful it is necessary to have a  bilateral Crimean-Ukrainian treaty and a bilateral  Crimean-Russian treaty. Second, there must be a favorable  political atmosphere. Unfortunately, the balance of political  forces on the peninsula is such that the Crimea can be regarded  as a hot spot. As Minin said, Crimea could become a center from  which reforms start, but it could also become a center from  which war starts. He confirmed his fears with the following  figures: In 1992 there were 2,500 people from the Ukrainian  Armed Forces on the peninsula. In 1994 there were 50,000  people. Their deployment in the region of Sevastopol and other  bays leaves one in no doubt of their aims.    Meanwhile, it is absolutely essential to Crimea that people  not be afraid to come, because the summer resort season,  according to Minin, is our main source of income.    There were also questions concerning the status of  Sevastopol  at the press conference. Minin said that every fourth  inhabitant of that city is engaged in supporting the Black Sea  Fleet. If the fleet is taken out of Sevastopol, this might mean  a new deportation. Previous attempts to settle the Sevastopol  problem have strained the situation even more.</p>

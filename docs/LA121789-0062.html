			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARS, BUSES AND AIR QUALITY  </P> <P> Wright was exactly right. Our growing traffic and air pollution problems in  Southern California will not improve until we change our driving habits -- a  step most of us are very reluctant to take.  </P> <P> I hope that some combination of governmental agencies, the news media and  environmental organizations will conduct a public education campaign to bring  about the necessary change in our attitude towards the automobile. After all,  there is more to consider than smog and traffic congestion, which are bad  enough in themselves. What about severe pollution damage to trees in nearby  national forests, carbon dioxide contributing to global warming, environmental  damage from oil drilling and transport, and increasing reliance on foreign  energy sources in politically unstable regions?  </P> <P> As an immediate first step, how difficult would it be for most of us to reduce  our driving by 15% by eliminating unnecessary trips?  </P> <P> And think of the example for the rest of the world if Los Angeles, of all  places, was able to clean up its air and traffic!  </P> <P> JAMES L. CULNAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> October 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / PEOPLE AND EVENTS  </P> <P> In an act of uncharacteristic moderation for politicians, the Los Angeles City  Council voted in February to cut the speaking time of members on issues from  five minutes to three.  </P> <P> Today, the council will consider a motion by members Zev Yaroslavsky and Mike  Woo to extend the yapping limit back to five minutes.  </P> <P> An unexpected re-evaluation?  </P> <P> Not really. After all, the council will soon begin televising its meetings.  </P> <P> You may remember keye/donna/pearlstein as the West Los Angeles firm that  lampooned the myriad sponsorships of the 1984 Olympics by hanging a banner that  proclaimed: "Official Advertising Agency of Olympic Boulevard."  </P> <P> Now the company has a comment on another matter: Outside its headquarters, the  city has ripped up a small patch of grass and trees so that it can install a  right-hand turn lane.  </P> <P> "We were pretty upset about it so we asked our people to come up with some  entries (for the banner)," said Paul Keye, chairman of the agency.  </P> <P> The suggestions included: "There Used To Be a Tree Here," "Welcome to Life in  the Turn Lane," and "Another Urban Uglification Project."  </P> <P> The agency settled on: "Asphalt 1. Trees 0."  </P> <P> Owing to the presence of the ocean a few hundred feet away, jury candidates in  the assembly room of the Long Beach Courthouse receive some unusual  instructions.  </P> <P> "Do not bring your beach wear, jurors," one recent group was told. "Do not wear  your swimming suits. This is not a beach resort. This is a court. You cannot  wear shorts. I have had jurors wear shorts and claim they were not shorts. We  all know what shorts are."  </P> <P> You might feel a few pains in your stomach just from reading this, but Pi Sigma  Epsilon fraternity of Cal Poly Pomona intends to build the world's largest  burrito Thursday, a projected 185-footer. That's around 200,000 calories or so  (assuming you don't use guacamole).  </P> <P> Once the beef and beans and lettuce and tomatoes and salsa monster is put  together, it will be cut into six-inch slices to raise funds for charitable  causes.  </P> <P> After the diners have finished, some of them might feel like taking a snooze in  the world's largest bed, which was recently constructed by the Acme Mattress  Factory of Long Beach.  </P> <P> Acme just learned that its 25-by-40-foot work of art will be cited in the 1990  edition of the Bible of crazies, the Guinness Book of World Records.  </P> <P> But the honored piece of furniture isn't on display in the Acme showroom.  </P> <P> "Oh, we dismantled it," said co-owner Ellen Boles. "It took up too much space."  </P></p>

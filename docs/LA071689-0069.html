			<p><P> July 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DISTRICT CALLED INSENSITIVE OVER ITS HANDLING OF MEDICAL CLAIMS  </P> <P> Rejecting claims for medical-bill reimbursement by several students who became  ill at a school-sponsored concert in April, the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified  School District board has forwarded the claims to the district's insurance  company.  </P> <P> District officials said denying the claims is a routine step before turning  them over to the insurance administrator, but parents nevertheless called the  board unsympathetic.  </P> <P> Eighteen students singing at the district's "Stairway of the Stars" performance  April 13 at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium experienced dizziness, nausea,  headaches and fainting after complaining of smelling strange odors. The  audience of 2,550 was evacuated.  </P> <P> Santa Monica fire officials were unable to find evidence of fumes or toxic  substances and speculated that the cause was mass hysteria.  </P> <P> Mass hysteria, which doctors prefer to call "group conversion reaction," is a  type of psychosomatic symptom that generally occurs in high-stress situations  within a tight-knit group, according to Dr. Michael Propper, a resident in  psychiatry at the UCLA Center for Health Services at Veterans Administration  Medical Center.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 8 Filed Claims  </P> <P> Eight students filed claims, ranging from $388 to $1,285, against the school  district.  </P> <P> The school board denied that it was insensitive to the students' claims. The  board last week asked for immediate feedback from the insurance company before  the company makes a final decision is made on the claims, said board member  Della Barrett. Usually the board is not involved in the review of claims and  receives only a periodic summary of the insurance company's decision on claims,  Barrett and other district officials said.  </P> <P> "In this case, we're real concerned about the children and their families. . .  . We're concerned about something happening during a school-sponsored event,  and I want to make sure the right thing is done," she said.  </P> <P> Terry Pearson, the district's director of pupil and administrator services,  said letters were sent to parents, offering assistance in filing claims.  </P> <P> Sharon Taub, who submitted a claim for $1,285 for her 11-year-old daughter's  ambulance, emergency room and doctor's bills, said last week that she has not  received any letters from school district officials. She said she is "disturbed  at the apparent lack of caring on (the school board's) part."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Adults Also Affected  </P> <P> Taub also said the mass-hysteria theory was nonsense.  </P> <P> "There were adults also affected. I received medical treatment, and I'm not an  adolescent and I am not given to hysteria." She said she and her daughter,  Vanessa, had sore throats and shortness of breath. Vanessa said the auditorium  smelled like a "mix of gas and paint" and that she fainted right after she was  taken outside.  </P> <P> The city of Santa Monica in June rejected claims for five students' medical  bills, said Chuck Cota, liability claims supervisor for the city. "We didn't  see any basis for any liability. . . . We investigated it, and the Fire  Department was out there. We couldn't find the source of any toxic-fume  escape."  </P> <P> The students can pursue their claims against the city by filing lawsuits within  six months of when the claims were denied, Cota said. No lawsuits had been  filed as of last week, he said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, UCLA and Los Angeles County Department of Health Services  researchers, who have sent a questionnaire to several hundred students who were  at the Civic Auditorium, have not determined a cause for the symptoms.  </P> <P> "The possibility of a group effect has to be considered, because the people  that were affected primarily were in a specific area" of the auditorium and  were stricken in rapid succession, said Dr. Michael Propper, a resident in  psychiatry at the UCLA Center for Health Services at Veterans Administration  Medical Center. "But the other side is that we haven't interviewed any of the  people yet."  </P></p>

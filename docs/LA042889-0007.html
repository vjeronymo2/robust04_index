			<p><P> April 28, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING  </P> <P> As I work in my weed-infested garden daily, I realize, for me, gardening is one  of the best exercises.  </P> <P> I sit down on my little rug, because when I stand up and chop weeds, I get too  tired. My whole body gets a workout this way. No spa for me these days!  </P> <P> The pleasures of home gardening are several. I get close to the earth -- it  seems to soothe me. When I plant my seeds, to see them pop up shortly, growing  bravely to maturity. Tomato seeds to luscious ripe tomatoes for my salad. My  very own produce!  </P> <P> Ever since I can remember, right here in central city L.A. where I was born,  I've had a garden. I remember specializing in carnations -- a dark-red variety  called Roosevelt. That was many years ago. Also turnips and radishes were  satisfying to a schoolgirl. In fact, our school had a healthy garden in which  the students worked during the week. Why, oh why, aren't school gardens popular  these days in L.A.? I haven't seen any -- maybe they abound in different  districts.  </P> <P> Oh, for our young people here in L.A. to transfer their energies to healthy,  prideful activities! Right around them are the ingredients -- a lovely climate  -- where things grow easily -- not snow and excessive heat. Even a little  ground around a disadvantaged neighborhood could be cultivated and bring forth  thrilling, little plants.  </P> <P> Gardening education is vital, I like to think.  </P> <P> LOIS ARENZ BERND  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

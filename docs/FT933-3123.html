			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / UK Company News: McDonnell Douglas IS at Pounds 5.2m McDonnell Douglas Information Systems, the computing services company created through a buy-out from the US aerospace group earlier this year, performed encouragingly in its first half year of independence. For the six months to June 30 pre-tax profits were Pounds 5.2m on revenues of Pounds 66.5m. Mr Jerry Causley, chief executive, said he was pleased with the result given difficult trading conditions and the time and energy the company's management had devoted to the buy-out. 'We continue to generate profit from our focus of providing total IT solutions to specific market niches,' he said. These include the health service and the police. The company this year won the contract to manage all the computer operations for the Devon and Cornwall Police. Yesterday it announced it had won a Pounds 8.3m contract let by four hospitals in East Anglia. MDIS traditionally performs significantly better in the second half of the year. Last year it reported operating profits of Pounds 19.6m on revenues of Pounds 160m. No date has yet been set for flotation, although it is clear the company is waiting only for encouraging market conditions to complement its financial performance. Cash remains strong but no acquisitions are anticipated.</p>

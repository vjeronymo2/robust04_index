			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMARENA JURY HEARS RECORDING;  </P> <P> COURT: THE SPANISH-LANGUAGE TAPE CONTAINS 64 MINUTES OF INTERROGATION OF THE  KIDNAPED AND SLAIN DEA AGENT. A 10-FOOT-HIGH TRANSLATION WAS BEAMED ONTO THE  COURTROOM WALL.  </P> <P> A federal court jury in Los Angeles spent 64 minutes Friday listening to the  taped interrogation of a desperate, dying U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration  agent who was trying to alternately placate and deceive narcotics traffickers  and corrupt Mexican police officials who were torturing him at a house in  Guadalajara.  </P> <P> As the recording of agent Enrique Camarena and his interrogators was played in  Spanish, jurors read a 10-foot-high English translation that was beamed onto a  wall of the courtroom.  </P> <P> Camarena's plea, "Don't hurt my family!" was emblazoned for several seconds  across the wall of the packed courtroom, as were the words "Don't hit me  anymore," "Ouch!" and "Eeeow!"At one point, Camarena asked his interrogators:  "Couldn't I ask you to have my ribs bandaged, please?" He was frequently heard  groaning, particularly in the latter phases of the interrogation.  </P> <P> The tapes contain several voices in addition to Camarena's. DEA officials have  identified two of his interrogators as drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero and  Mexican intelligence official Sergio Espino Verdin, both of whom are now  imprisoned in Mexico after being convicted there for involvement in Camarena's  1985 kidnaping, torture and murder.  </P> <P> At several points in the tape, Camarena refers to his interrogator as  "commandante," presumably a reference to Espino, who was a commander with  Mexico's Federal Security Directorate.  </P> <P> None of the men on trial in Los Angeles are mentioned in the tapes, nor is  there any allegation that their voices are on them. But defense attorneys  nonetheless tried for several days to prevent the tapes from being played,  contending that they would prejudice the jury. U.S. District Judge Edward  Rafeedie, however, ruled Thursday that prosecutors had a right to play them.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano had argued that the actual tapes were the  "best evidence" of Camarena's interrogation and accused the defense of  attempting to keep relevant evidence away from the jury.  </P> <P> On Friday morning, defense lawyers lost a last-ditch bid to keep the tapes from  being played when a federal appeals court panel in Pasadena denied their motion  to overrule Rafeedie.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Rafeedie cautioned the jury just before the tapes were played that  they constituted only one piece of evidence in the complex case and warned  jurors not to be swayed by any emotional reaction that they might have to the  tapes.  </P> <P> At a break during the playing of the tapes Friday afternoon, defense lawyer  Mary Kelly told reporters that the prosecution was playing the tapes simply "to  get the prejudicial impact of the grunts and groans."  </P> <P> But prosecutor Medrano countered: "We have to prove torture. This shows  torture."  </P> <P> Camarena was tortured for two days at a Guadalajara house owned by Caro. One of  the interrogators methodically asked him questions about what he knew about  Caro and other drug traffickers.  </P> <P> The man asked Camarena detailed questions on what the DEA knew about the homes  and businesses of Caro and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, another drug kingpin. The  interrogator also asked questions about two men who were informants for the  DEA.  </P> <P> Camarena grudgingly yielded some information, including some about one of  Caro's airplanes, but told his inquisitors that he had little information that  they were interested in and added that during the previous year he had not been  very active and was looking forward to his transfer out of Guadalajara in less  than three weeks time.  </P> <P> Camarena, in fact, had been granted a transfer to San Diego after several years  work in Guadalajara, but right up to the point of his kidnaping he had been  investigating drug traffickers and their ties to Mexican police officials.  </P> <P> The principal interrogator clearly knew a lot about DEA activities in Mexico  and asked where certain DEA agents lived and what they were working on. On two  occasions, he attempted to needle Camarena by asking him whether he was being  paid off by Caro, which Camarena steadfastly denied.  </P> <P> The DEA obtained the tapes in April, 1985, after a CIA agent received a tip  from a Mexican informant. Mexican Federal Judicial Police officials told the  DEA that the tapes had been recovered by local police in Puerta Vallarta when  they arrested drug trafficker Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. After the first set of  tapes was recovered, transcripts of other tapes were also found. They have not  yet been produced in this case.  </P> <P> DEA officials have said they are not sure why the tapes were made. Some agency  officials have speculated that the interrogation was recorded so that tapes  could be played by drug traffickers and their allies in Mexican law enforcement  who wanted to know what Camarena knew about their operations.  </P> <P> In other developments Friday, two prosecution witnesses gave testimony that was  beneficial to two of the defendants in the case.  </P> <P> James Kuykendall, who ran the DEA office in Guadalajara at the time Camarena  was killed, said he had interviewed defendant Ruben Zuno Arce in San Antonio,  Tex., in September, 1986, and decided against arresting him at the time because  he concluded that Zuno had no involvement in the kidnaping. He also said that  as far as he knew at that time, Zuno was not part of the Guadalajara narcotics  cartel.  </P> <P> Zuno's lawyers said they were pleased by Kuykendall's statements, which were  made on cross-examination.  </P> <P> In other testimony, the ex-wife of defendant Javier Vasquez Velasco described  trips that she took with him in early 1985 that could serve as an alibi.  </P></p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Rail strike on after Acas talks fail to bring deal The crisis on Britain's railways deepened last night after seven hours of negotiations at Acas, the conciliation service, failed to break the deadlock in the signal staff dispute. Tomorrow's second 24 hour strike by signals staff will now go ahead, causing massive disruption to the railway network. Mr Vernon Hince, chief negotiator for the RMT rail union, said that Railtrack, the state-owned railway infrastructure company, had not dealt with the union claim for an 11 per cent interim payment for past productivity improvements. 'No negotiations had taken place,' he said. 'We are no further forward than we were 12 days ago.' Railtrack chief negotiator Mr David Armstrong said the company had offered the signal staff productivity pay rises of between 16 and 26 per cent which would involve a new grading structures and acceptance of new working practises. The improvements would produce benefits worth Pounds 4.3m. This is addition to the 2.5per cent pay offer already on the table. The government had earlier appeared to be digging in for a lengthy confrontation with the RMT as the last-ditch talks aimed at averting the 24-hour strike by signals staff began last night. Ministers repeatedly attacked union's 'irresponsible' pay claim and, amid angry Commons exchanges, Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, condemned the strike planned for tomorrow. He warned that some passengers would not return to the railway. It also emerged that Mr MacGregor had established a committee of senior ministers to monitor the strike by signals staff and guide the government's response. The committee met for the first time yesterday to discuss the prospects for further railway chaos if Aslef, the train drivers' union, also decides to strike. The start of the Acas talks was delayed by 90 minutes when managers from Railtrack arrived late. In the Commons, Mr MacGregor said it was 'damaging to the railway for the unions to undertake a series of strikes on an 11 per cent, no-strings pay claim'. He told MPs at question time that Railtrack wanted to achieve a settlement based on talks on restructuring, which would be separate from the company's 2.5 per cent pay offer. Shouting down claims by Labour MPs that the government had engineered the strike, Mr MacGregor said the restructuring talks would have to offer 'value for money'. Mr MacGregor dismissed claims that Railtrack had spent more on refurbishing its headquarters than the estimated cost of settling the strike. Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's transport spokesman, said the dispute could have been avoided if the government had not intervened to order Railtrack to withdraw a proposed pay offer of 5.7 per cent.

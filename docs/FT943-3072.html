			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sawmill talks may restart A strike in British Columbia's coastal logging and saw milling industry may yet be averted. Mr Gerry Stoney, president of the IWA-Canada, representing 15,000 coastal wood workers, said 'informal attempts' were being made to restart full negotiations with the employers' group in Forest Industrial Relations. 'We broke off negotiations at the weekend because of a log jam over pay and job security,' Mr Stoney said in Vancouver yesterday. FIR has offered 6 per cent over three years plus a CDollars 500 (Pounds 235) signing bonus, while the IWA-Canada has reduced its original pay demand from 18 per cent to 13 per cent over three years. 'The company must improve their offer before full negotiations can resume,' said Mr Stoney. 'In any case no settlement is likely before the weekend. Job security is highly important for us.' Sporadic stoppages by wood workers on Vancouver Island were halted early this week after the provincial Labour Relations Board ruled that they were illegal.</p>

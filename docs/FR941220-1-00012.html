			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Availability of NPRMs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM&hyph;103, Attention: Rules Docket  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No. 94&hyph;NM&hyph;194&hyph;AD, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055&hyph;4056.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA has received a report of heavy smoke in the cockpit coming from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> overhead switch panel on a McDonnell Douglas Model DC&hyph;9&hyph;81 (MD&hyph;81) series airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Investigation revealed that the fire had originated in the area of the emergency power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switch in the overhead switch panel. Further investigation, conducted by Mason Electric  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Company (the manufacturer of the emergency power switch), revealed that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency power switch, upon exceeding 10,000 switch cycles (off-to-on-to-off) can fail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> due to wear or overstress. If not replaced in a timely manner, the emergency power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> switch could fail and lead to a short in the electrical circuit, which could result in a fire in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the overhead switch panel and smoke in the cockpit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA has reviewed and approved McDonnell Douglas DC&hyph;9 Service Bulletin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24&hyph;150, dated March 28, 1994, which describes procedures for repetitively replacing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at regular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intervals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitively  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacing the emergency power switch in the overhead switch panel with a new switch at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular intervals. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the service bulletin described previously.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of recent communications with the Air Transport Association (ATA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of America, the FAA has learned that, in general, some operators may misunderstand the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> legal effect of AD's on airplanes that are identified in the applicability provision of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AD, but that have been altered or repaired in the area addressed by the AD. The FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> points out that all airplanes identified in the applicability provision of an AD are legally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subject to the AD. If an airplane has been altered or repaired in the affected area in such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way as to affect compliance with the AD, the owner or operator is required to obtain FAA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval for an alternative method of compliance with the AD, in accordance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph of each AD that provides for such approvals. A note has been included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice to clarify this requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 1,990 Model DC&hyph;9, DC&hyph;9&hyph;80, and C&hyph;9 (Military) series  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> airplanes and Model MD&hyph;88 airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FAA estimates that 992 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions, and that the average labor rate is $60 per work hour. Required parts would cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approximately $1,434 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $1,541,568, or $1,554 per airplane, per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> replacement cycle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The total cost impact figure discussed above is based on assumptions that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operator has yet accomplished any of the proposed requirements of this AD action, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that no operator would accomplish those actions in the future if this AD were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Docket at the location provided under the caption  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> The Proposed Amendment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulations (14 CFR part 39) as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

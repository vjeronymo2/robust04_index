			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / ANC admits own use of torture AN INQUIRY commissioned by the African National Congress has found that the organisation severely tortured and mistreated prisoners detained in its prison camps outside South Africa in the 1980s, but the ANC refused yesterday to release the names of officials identified in the report. Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, said the abuses it described were 'inexcusable'. But the names of those who carried out torture - many of whom still hold senior positions in the ANC security department - would remain secret. No action would be taken against them until after a further inquiry. The ANC's failure to release the names of those involved has left the movement open to the criticism that it - like the government, which last week introduced legislation in parliament to keep state crimes secret - is trying to cover up serious human rights abuses in its ranks. Mr Mandela said an independent board of inquiry would be constituted to probe the charges further and ensure that abuse did not continue. 'Some of the witnesses we saw have been brutalised and broken,' the commission report states. The government and the radical black Pan Africanist Congress will begin their first formal democracy negotiations in Botswana on Friday, Reuter reports from Cape Town. The PAC has refused to join multi-party talks inside South Africa about a transition to democracy.</p>

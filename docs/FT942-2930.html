			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / House starts in US up 22% in 12 months US housing starts rose 2.6 per cent last month and by 22 per cent in the year to May, indicating residential construction remains fairly resilient despite the rise in long-term interest rates since February. Housing starts last month were running at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.51m, below the peak of 1.61m hit last December. During the first five months of this year, the average level of starts was 21 per cent higher than in the same period last year. A sharp recent fall in applications for mortgages, however, has raised doubts about future demand for new homes. However Mr Lloyd Bentsen, Treasury Secretary, said he was 'encouraged' by the increase in starts. He said 30-year mortgage rates were still favourable, which should continue to help the industry. In a separate report yesterday the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said its index of manufacturing activity rose modestly this month to 16.1 against 14.8 in May, but remained below first-quarter levels. The index indicates the direction of change in manufacturing production, rather than its magnitude. An index for new orders declined from May indicating the pace of growth may be slowing. Claims for state unemployment insurance fell to 348,000 in the week ended June 8, the lowest level in two months and a further sign that demand for labour remains strong.</p>

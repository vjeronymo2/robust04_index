			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / EU risks Brussels presidency deadlock Fears were growing last night that this week's European summit in Corfu will be unable to break the deadlock over the succession to Mr Jacques Delors as president of the European Commission. A stalemate risks putting Europe's political leaders on a collision course with the new European Parliament which had hoped to scrutinise the choice of Commission president at its opening session next month. It would also be a sharp diplomatic setback for the outgoing Greek presidency of the Union. Prospects of a deadlock have increased in recent days as Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister and one-time favourite, has refused to bow to Franco-German pressure in favour of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister, who formally entered the race last Friday. Germany, which takes over the presidency of the EU on July 1, now appears to take a relaxed view of the danger of reaching a deadlock on issue at Corfu. Senior German government officials now believe such an outcome may be inevitable, even if regrettable, and are preparing for the possibility of having to call an emergency summit. This would probably take place in the early autumn. 'The federal government hopes that (the summit) succeeds in deciding the question,' Mr Dieter Vogel, the German government spokesman, said. 'If not, we will have to do it later. It is important that we decide this soon.' Senior diplomats in Brussels, Madrid and London agreed that it was unlikely that Greece would be able to broker a compromise during the Corfu meeting. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, was also said to be unwilling to drop Sir Leon Brittan, chief EU trade negotiator, in favour of Mr Dehaene. Mr Antonio Martino, the Italian foreign minister, who was in Bonn yesterday for talks with Mr Klaus Kinkel, his German counterpart, also said later that he thought a deadlock on the Commission presidency was probable. He did not think it would be 'a great drama' if a special summit had to be called to decide on the presidency in the autumn. The German government has hitherto expressed concern that everything should be done correctly by the member states to respect the new powers of the European parliament, which intends to put the future Commission president, and his individual commissioners, through a parliamentary vetting and approval procedure. This would mean not only submitting the candidacy of the president at the earliest possible opportunity, but also the names of his commissioners. For Germany in particular, with a general election in October, it is politically difficult to finalise the names of commissioners at an earlier date. The proposed solution was to nominate one from Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, and one from the opposition Social Democratic party, to ensure a balance whichever party wins the German election. Thus the prospect of deadlock in Corfu, and a special EU summit in Germany in September, could have a twin advantage for Chancellor Kohl. It would provide him with an additional opportunity to play the international statesman before the Germans go to the polls on October 16. It also would mean that a decision on the German commissioners might reasonably be left until the election result is beyond doubt.</p>

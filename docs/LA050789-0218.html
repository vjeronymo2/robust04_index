			<p><P> May 7, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TRUSTEES OK ACTION TO DISCIPLINE STRIKERS AT ANAHEIM SCHOOLS  </P> <P> Bracing for a threatened strike, trustees of Anaheim Union School District  moved Saturday to punish teachers who participate with loss of salary or  disciplinary action and to hire up to 700 substitutes.  </P> <P> The action came 1 day after a union representing 900 teachers in the district  voted overwhelmingly to stage a 1-day strike Wednesday to protest stalled  contract negotiations.  </P> <P> School officials reaffirmed their plans to keep schools open despite the  strike.  </P> <P> The five board members, along with most of the district's ranking  administrators, gathered at district headquarters in the unusual emergency  meeting Saturday morning. One key decision makes it extremely difficult for  regularly employed teachers to take a sick or personal day off during the  walkout.  </P> <P> "We took these measures basically to tighten up on our policies and to prepare  for the strike. We do not expect that this (union) action will result in any  disruption of the educational process," said Leroy L. Kellogg, assistant  superintendent for administrative services.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deficit Cited  </P> <P> Teachers, whose salaries range from $21,000 to $42,000 annually, are demanding  an immediate 3.2% wage increase. The district, facing declining enrollments and  claiming to have run a multimillion-dollar deficit last school year, has  offered wage rates based on its total budget, with no specific increases  guaranteed.  </P> <P> With the board's approval Saturday, teachers who would normally be allowed to  use a sick day or take a leave of personal necessity will now be required to  fully document their absence, such as by providing a note from a physician.  </P> <P> The board decided that requests for leave must be made directly to the  district's assistant superintendent for personnel services, rather than local  principals.  </P> <P> "What these resolutions say is that we are simply not authorizing leaves (for  the day of the strike) unless they have valid (reasons.) The resolution states  that they (teachers without authorized absences) will face either a loss of  salary or disciplinary procedures or both," Kellogg said.  </P> <P> The head of the Anaheim Secondary Teachers Assn., Leonard Lahtinen, said the  board actions were not unexpected.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'No Respect for Teachers'  </P> <P> "That would be standard operating procedure for them," said Lahtinen. "They  have little or no respect for teachers as it is. Why should they start now?"  </P> <P> The last contract between the union and the district expired last August.  Despite the attempts of a state mediator, the two sides have failed to reach  any agreement.  </P> <P> Kellogg said the salary dispute is based upon different perceptions of whether  or not the district, which is facing continually declining enrollments and  worsening deficits, can afford the demands of the teachers.  </P> <P> The last offer made by the district would hold teacher salaries for the next  school year to the same proportion of the total budget as this year -- after a  reserve fund of 2.5% is set aside. Any money left over would be given to the  teachers in the form of salary increases, up to a total of 5%.  </P> <P> In the following year, there would be salary increases after a 3% reserve fund  was established, with a maximum salary increase of 8%.  </P> <P> The union is demanding 3.2% salary increase for this year, in addition to 41%  of what is left after the 2.5% reserve is set aside.  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / People: Kleinwort Benson Group Jeremy Lancaster, 57, chairman and managing director of Wolseley, the world's biggest plumbers' merchant, has been appointed a non-executive director of Kleinwort Benson Group. Lord Rockley, who took over as chairman of Kleinwort in April, says that he had been looking for a successful industrialist to help fill the gap on his board following the retirement of Sir David Steel and the late Sir George Turnbull. Lancaster, who has headed Wolseley since 1976, is well regarded in the City. Educated at Rugby and Christ Church, Oxford, he did his apprenticeship at GKN before joining the family company in 1961. In 1976 he took over from his father, Norman Lancaster; since then the company's sales have risen from Pounds 72m to Pounds 1.9bn and pre-tax profits have gone up more than 20 fold. Another sign of City approval came earlier this year when Wolseley joined the FT-SE 100 index.</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / International Company News: Power talks behind schedule Power Corporation, the Irish property company, has signalled that negotiations on a vital new equity injection are not going as well as had been hoped. The company said it had only a 'reasonable prospect' of concluding a deal under which Insas, the quoted Malaysian property company, would invest IPounds 50m (Pounds 49.4m) and take a 49.2 per cent stake. A placing with outside investors and an open offer to raise an additional IPounds 50m is also planned. The negotiations with Insas are behind schedule, admits Mr Tony Leonard, Power's managing director, but he maintains that there are no major stumbling blocks. 'We have come across points that took longer to negotiate than expected,' he said. Mr Robin Power, the chairman, blamed the delays on the 'complexity of the transaction, different time zones in Kuala Lumpur, the US, London and Dublin and the number of parties involved.' The deal has to be approved by the syndicate of 14 banks which are currently owed IPounds 220m and are supporting Power. Mr Leonard is hopeful the deal will be completed by the 'end of autumn,' but said there was no deadline. Power, which desperately needs the new equity injection, has announced pre-tax losses of IPounds 13.4m for the year to the end of March. Last year's losses of IPounds 104.86m were one of the largest ever reported by a quoted Irish company, and were due mainly to exceptional write-offs of IPounds 97.1m to cover Power's exposure to the bankrupt Trocadero development in London and falls in the value of its property portfolio in Ireland, Britain and the US. Trading losses have been cut from IPounds 7.7m to IPounds 5.2m as a result of property disposals and reductions in overheads, according to Mr Leonard. Power's auditors have drawn attention to the current status of the group's banking arrangements in their opinion in the accounts, which have not yet been published. The auditors also draw attention to the negotiations on debt restructuring and the outcome of a compensation claim, but have not qualified the accounts according to Power. Power is currently pursuing a claim against the Los Angeles Unified School District which has abandoned a compulsory purchase of a site owned by Power in Los Angeles.</p>

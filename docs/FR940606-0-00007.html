			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The response to this comment is that the NRC's proposed rule was directed to a specific and narrow issue_whether a potential requester with actual notice of an application should be able to delay filing a hearing request until the application is granted. The notice did not contemplate revising the rule to change the concept of making the receipt of actual notice the basis of the time for filing a hearing request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Comment of Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second comment was from Ohio Citizens for Responsible Energy (OCRE), which objected to the portion of the regulation that bars petitions filed more than 180 days after the NRC's grant of an application. OCRE asserted that it was conceivable that someone would not learn of a licensing action until after the passage of 180 days, and would by then, through no fault of his or her own, have lost all opportunity to request a hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OCRE's point, like Kerr-McGee's, goes beyond the scope of the quite narrow change that the NRC proposed. The Commission's notice made clear that the issue to be resolved was whether potential requesters with actual notice of an application for a particular licensing action were intended to have two bites at the apple, or should instead be required to file for a hearing at their earliest opportunity. The concept of a 180-day cutoff was never identified as being subject to reconsideration by the Commission.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Having considered the comments received, and finding that neither of them suggests a flaw in the specific correction proposed in the rule, the Commission has determined that the following final rule should be promulgated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC has determined that this regulation is the type of action described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore, neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental assessment has been prepared for this final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not contain a new or amended information collection requirement subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ). Existing requirements were approved by the Office of Management and Budget, approval number 3150&hyph;0136.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Nuclear Regulatory Commission prepared a brief regulatory analysis for the proposed rule. Neither of the commenters having discussed the regulatory analysis, the Commission has not considered it necessary to prepare a separate analysis of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the Commission certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule sets forth the time frame within which a person other than an applicant must file a request for a hearing in a licensing proceeding held under the informal procedures set forth in 10 CFR part 2, subpart L. The rule does not impose any obligations on regulated entities that may fall within the definition of ``small entities'' as set forth in section 601(3) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, or within the definition of ``small business'' as found in section 3 of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 632, or within the small business size standards contained in 13 CFR part 121.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Backfit Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This rule does not involve any new provisions which would impose backfits as defined in 10 CFR 50.109(a)(1). Accordingly, no backfit analysis pursuant to 10 CFR 50.109(c) is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Antitrust, Byproduct material, Classified information, Environmental protection, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and reactors, Penalties, Sex discrimination, Source material, Special nuclear material, Waste treatment and disposal. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and 5 U.S.C. 552 and 553, the NRC is adopting the following amendments to 10 CFR part 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=56 g=1 f=1 --> PART 2_RULES OF PRACTICE FOR DOMESTIC LICENSING PROCEEDINGS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

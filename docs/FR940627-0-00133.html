			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Groups are further subdivided according to the presence of polymers containing atypical element(s) in their molecular structure. F/FAs containing polymers are considered atypical for a respective fuel family only if the F/FA product as a whole contains one or more atypical elements. If the polymer contains an atypical element as part of its molecular structure, then the atypical polymer defines a separate atypical group. For example, the presence of polyethylene in a gasoline product does not in itself make that product atypical because polyethylene contains no elements in addition to carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur. On the other hand, if the gasoline product contains chlorinated polyethylene, then the product is considered atypical because of the chlorine content (chlorine is an atypical element for the gasoline fuel family). Such product could group with other atypical gasoline products containing chlorinated polymers. However, if the atypical gasoline product contains polyethylene and chlorine as two different components of the formulation, the product will group with other atypical gasoline products containing chlorine in non-polymer constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For groups defined by a single atypical constituent, the representative to be used in satisfying the group's testing requirements will be the member fuel or additive/base fuel mixture with the highest actual or recommended concentration-in-use of the atypical constituent. Within a group of such products containing a unique combination of two or more atypical elements, the representative shall be the product which has the highest total concentration of atypical elements. In the case that two or more products within such a group contain the same and highest concentration of atypical constituents, the process specified for selecting the representative gives precedence to the highest total concentration of the atypical constituents in the following priority order: (1) Total concentration of metals, (2) total concentration of halogens, (3) total concentration of other atypical elements (including sulfur, if applicable), (4) total concentration of polymers containing atypical elements, (5) total concentration of oxygen.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed previously, current fuel registration procedures allow manufacturers to include in their registration a list of potential bulk additives to be used in the fuel. As a result, registrations could include several additives containing one or more atypical constituents with the same purpose-in-use, but which are not intended by the fuel manufacturer to be used at the same time. If several additives for the same purpose-in-use are listed in a single registration, and if these additives contain different atypical elements, the manufacturer is responsible for testing each individual atypical additive separately. This means that each unique atypical additive listed in a registration for the same purpose-in-use will define a different testing group. On the other hand, if a fuel registration includes additives with different functions and different atypical elements, and if these additives are normally blended together in the same formulation, then the manufacturer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is allowed to test them together (or to participate in an applicable group). For example, if a diesel fuel registration lists two atypical biocide additives, one containing boron and the other containing chlorine, the fuel manufacturer would then be responsible for testing two formulations (one diesel formulation containing boron and one diesel formulation containing chlorine). However, if the registration includes a boron-containing biocide and a chlorine-containing detergent, then the manufacturer may test the two additives together.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Implementation of Grouping System and Cost-Sharing Provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The grouping system included in this final rule allows manufacturers of similar F/FAs, on a voluntary basis, to pool their resources and efforts to satisfy the registration requirements. The primary objectives of the grouping system and cost-sharing provisions are to reduce the overall costs of the registration program and maximize the efficiency of the program by avoiding duplication of effort. The grouping and cost-sharing provisions included in today's rule are supported by CAA section 211(e)(3)(B), which permits manufacturers of similar F/FAs to share the testing costs of the program so that requirements can be met without duplication. Although this rule allows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers to comply with the program's requirements by participation in a group, each manufacturer continues to be individually subject to this rule and responsible for testing under this rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The practical implementation of the grouping system involves two major tasks: (1) The organization and administration of group functions, and (2) the development of equitable arrangements for cost-sharing. Backed by its experience with respect to the TSCA testing program, EPA judges that the F/FA industry, under the aegis of its various trade associations or other third parties, is capable of accomplishing these tasks with little or no Agency assistance and interference. EPA's experience with cost-shared testing under TSCA regulations (40 CFR part 791) indicates that manufacturers prefer to work out their own cost-sharing arrangements, and EPA anticipates that F/FA registration applicants will likewise prefer to work out their own cost-sharing agreements. Public comments from the regulated industry support this assumption. Thus, EPA intends for manufacturers to work out cost-sharing agreements by themselves. However, if F/FA manufacturers cannot work out cost reimbursement, this rule allows F/FA manufacturers to use procedures similar to existing TSCA procedures [see &sect;79.56(c) of this rule] for resolution of disputes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

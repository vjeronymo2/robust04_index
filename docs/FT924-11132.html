			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / Babcock group offers Pounds 267m Rosyth guarantee A CONSORTIUM led by the Babcock International engineering group is offering to underwrite a Pounds 267m project to complete work on new submarine docks at Rosyth in Scotland, in an effort to save the dockyard. The guarantee by Babcock, Wimpey Construction and NNC, a subsidiary of General Electric Company of the UK, means that they would carry responsibility for any cost overruns. Babcock International has a 65 per cent interest, alongside Thorn EMI, in the company which has been operating the state-owned Rosyth Royal Dockyard since 1987. It is fighting to prevent its work on nuclear-powered submarines being moved to the Devonport yard at Plymouth. Rosyth managers have said that if that happened the yard, which employs 4,000 people, would face closure. Up to now Rosyth has carried out all refitting and refuelling of Britain's Polaris ballistic-missile submarines. Work on other nuclear-powered submarines has been split between the yards. Construction of the new facility at Rosyth began five years ago in order to provide a dock big enough for the Trident submarines which will replace the Polaris boats. The Pounds 267m would be in addition to more than Pounds 120m already spent on the project. DML, Devonport's operator, is bidding to take over all the submarine work with a rival project that it says could be completed for Pounds 170m. Babcock, however, claims that the Devonport project, based on adapting 70-year-old docks to meet nuclear safety requirements, could prove much more expensive than planned.</p>

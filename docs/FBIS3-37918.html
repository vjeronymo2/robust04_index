FAGCSI-zation of All Powers Over"]    [Text] The war waged for many months by the Federal Agency  of Government Communications Services and Information under the  Russian Federation president (FAGCSI) to be the sole master of  the information systems catering to the top bodies of power has  been crowned with success. Under Boris Yeltsin's edict signed  Monday evening, the only structure opposing the FAGCSI -- the  Administration for Information Resources of the presidential  staff (AIR) -- has been abolished and its functions handed over  to FAGCSI.    The war between FAGCSI and AIR -- the last "electronic  subunit in the system of the supreme organs of power that worked  with unclassified information -- had been waged for more than a  year. Its methods were fully in line with the agency's  background -- the former directorate for government  communication service of the KGB. Back in summer 1993, a memo  prepared by the Security Ministry, the Communications Ministry,  and the FAGCSI was put on the president's desk. Viktor  Barannikov, Vasiliy Bulgak, and Aleksandr Starovoytov hinted at  certain "state-run and commercial organizations" that enlisted  the services of foreign firms to create information networks  which, in the authors' view, enabled Western special services  "to introduce into the Russian market systems of processing,  storage, and transmission of information enabling these services  to monitor information."    The unnamed organizations implied that AIR and its chief,  Vasiliy Kupriyanovskiy, was trying to set up a system,  independent from FAGCSI, of information telecommunications which  contravened the plan for the creation of "a single information  space" in Russia elaborated in the former KGB Directorate for  Government Communications Service. On the basis of FAGCSI,  naturally. Starovoytov, however, needed another six months for  finally "eating up" the last unclassified information structure.  No proof of Kupriyanovskiy's "pro-spy" activities could be  procured and he was fired the day AIR was abolished "for  repeated gross violations of office discipline" -- taking a trip  to Italy without Sergey Filatov's authorization (but with the  authorizations of Filatov's deputies).    The outcome of the standoff certified by the president's  edict makes it possible for FAGCSI, led by a former KGB general,  not only autocratically "to protect" all information circulating  in the top organs of power, but also, and naturally enough, to  monitor it in the same autocratic manner.</p>

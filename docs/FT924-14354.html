			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Letter: Economics of village opera Sir, The Royal Opera House serves a useful function as the village hall of the richer members of the London City village community. You seem to be seeking to consolidate the position of the Financial Times as the newspaper of this little community when you urge the government to contribute 'perhaps Pounds 15m' to the cost of refurbishing the Opera House, and suggest that the spirit of the Falklands war should be employed to ensure that the hall need not be closed for long ('Brooke's Opera', October 5). There are many village halls in the UK, and many of them have outdated facilities. Do you believe that every village community is entitled to government grants to refurbish their halls? In the FT's other guise, as a newspaper that comments on economic policy, perhaps it could consider the criteria that should determine government finance for village halls. As it stands, you seem to believe that the criterion should be: 'To him who hath shall be given.' David Sawers, 'Crosby', 10 Seaview Avenue, Angmering-on-Sea, Littlehampton, West Sussex BN16 1PP</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FROM MOUTHS OF BABES, INSIGHTS;  </P> <P> PSYCHOLOGY: LOIS BARCLAY MURPHY HAS BEEN A STAR IN EXPLORING THE EMOTIONAL LIFE  OF INFANTS AND CHILDREN. NOW 87, SHE IS STILL HARD AT WORK.  </P> <P> In 1938, child psychologist Lois Barclay Murphy and her family drove from New  York to California.  </P> <P> At the Kansas border, they took a detour. Their 6-year-old daughter, Midge,  knew the story of the Wizard of Oz and refused to enter the state of Kansas.  She was not going to be blown away like Dorothy, she told her parents. She  would get out of the car if necessary.  </P> <P> "Since we could not truthfully guarantee that there would be no tornado in  Kansas, and since it seemed a minor concession to make to a strong-minded child  whom we respected, we changed the plan and drove through Nebraska," Murphy  explains in the introduction to one of her many books on child psychology.  </P> <P> Many parents -- and child psychologists -- might have taken a less  understanding approach to a child's fears. But Murphy has spent her life  observing, listening and trying to comprehend what goes on in the minds and  hearts of infants, children and adolescents.  </P> <P> "She has been a star in describing the vulnerability of children and the ways  in which they can be hurt," said Lewis Lipsitt, director of the Child Study  Center at Brown University.  </P> <P> Murphy was one of the first to document feelings of sympathy in preschoolers.  </P> <P> "The head of the nursery school told me that the study was futile since she  felt children that young didn't have any sympathy," Murphy recalls.  </P> <P> But Murphy's study showed that even children as young as 2 could show caring  for each other, comfort each other, defend each other from other children or  warn each other about danger.  </P> <P> She was also one of the first to measure the vulnerability of infants and young  children to early problems. And before the word coping was a buzzword in the  child-development literature, she conducted research to examine how some  children manage to cope with stressful life circumstances, ranging from serious  illnesses to moving.  </P> <P> Now 87 ("I'm an old, old woman," she said recently, though neither her  appearance nor her voice give her age away), Murphy is still hard at work and  divides her time between an apartment in Washington and a house she designed in  the New Hampshire woods.  </P> <P> She writes regularly for "Zero to Three," a publication of the National Center  for Clinical Infant Programs. She has just finished editing a book of  scientific papers by her late husband, Gardner Murphy, also a noted  psychologist who chaired Columbia University's psychology department before  becoming director of research at the Menninger Foundation in Topeka.  </P> <P> Her current project is a biography of Gardner, to whom she was married for 53  years. She plans to finish the book next year.  </P> <P> But what has earned her a place in the annals of psychological research is her  fundamental belief in the importance of simply listening to children --  following their lead rather than imposing adult standards on them.  </P> <P> "Childbearing then is not just a matter of taking care of the baby and the  young child -- whether with a philosophy of permissiveness or of discipline --  but of supporting the child's efforts to take care of himself," she wrote with  co-author Alice E. Moriarty in the book "Vulnerability, Coping and Growth."  </P> <P> "We need to try to feel our way into the experience of the child, as the child  feels and experiences it," she said.  </P> <P> Murphy has spent her career investigating this premise. Along the way, she and  her husband had a son and adopted a daughter.  </P> <P> "Gardner was a feminist," she said. "He said before we got married, 'I want my  wife to use her brains, and I don't want you to spend more than 20 minutes a  day on the house.' I smiled to myself. But I didn't really work full time until  my children were in college."  </P> <P> She nevertheless managed to produce an extraordinary body of scholarship,  including 16 books on child development and scores of papers. She has received  numerous awards, including the Dolly Madison award of the National Center for  Clinical Infant Programs.  </P> <P> Her work also includes hundreds of black-and-white photographs that show  children throughout the world just being themselves.  </P> <P> In Nigeria, she captured a child confidently carrying another boy piggyback.  She observed families in Tashkent, Soviet Union, in the 1950s. She studied  foundlings in New York City, started and headed the first child-development  center at Sarah Lawrence College and helped conduct one of the early landmark  studies of infants and preschoolers at the Menninger Foundation.  </P> <P> The daughter of a Methodist-Episcopal minister, Murphy was born in 1902 in  Lisbon, Iowa. Her great-grandfather was a pioneer and her grandfather was a  state senator.  </P> <P> "I was taught very, very young that as a Barclay with pioneer forebears, I was  born to be a pioneer," she said.  </P> <P> She went to Vassar on scholarship.  </P> <P> "My mother thought Vassar would make me into a lady. I was a mousy little  bookworm and didn't fit the image of what my mother wanted in a daughter. She  wanted someone glamorous."  </P> <P> From Vassar, she moved on to Union Theological Seminary for a master's degree  in theology, planning to teach comparative religion. Her college roommate  introduced her to Gardner, who was teaching psychology at Columbia. They  married a few years later. In the meantime, she had graduated and was teaching  comparative religion at Sarah Lawrence.  </P> <P> She met the head of the Macy Foundation in New York and proposed studying  sympathy in preschoolers.  </P> <P> "Do it and send me the bill," he told her.  </P> <P> The resulting study not only became her doctoral dissertation at Columbia's  Teachers College but was later published as a book and launched her career as a  child psychologist. It remains a standard work in psychology.  </P> <P> As she looks back half a century later, what gives Murphy the most pride and  satisfaction is the work that she did with the Head Start program for poor  children in the 1960s.  </P> <P> Most vivid of all in her memory are those children -- and their mothers -- who  changed, who were able to grow and achieve something they never would have  achieved without Head Start.  </P> <P> In particular, she remembers one mother, dirty and disheveled and without hope.  </P> <P> "We put her on a committee on Head Start," Murphy said. Her appearance began to  change. The woman went back to school, got her high-school equivalency  certificate and began working.  </P> <P> "In other words," Murphy said, "she started feeling respected. She saw  possibilities."  </P></p>

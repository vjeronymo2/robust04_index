			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE'S 7,400 ACRES  </P> <P> Some conservationists, suddenly turned Bob Hope bashers, would like the world  to believe that Hope is a cheapskate, a miser, a Scrooge because he refuses to  donate 7,400 acres he owns.  </P> <P> Before anyone starts to believe such tripe, let me say, as one who knows, that  no one has done more for genuinely charitable causes than has Hope.  </P> <P> Ask any fighting GI of World War II or the Korean conflict. They will tell you  what it meant to spend an hour or two away from enemy shelling to watch a Hope  USO show on a jungle airstrip, the deck of an aircraft carrier, in a field  hospital or an area a few hundred yards from the front lines. An untold number  of American men can attribute their lives to this man of good humor for the  needed morale boost he gave them that enabled them to continue to do the job  they had to do.  </P> <P> Ask the officials of hospitals and educational institutions which have received  sorely needed financial support as a result of Hope's efforts. Ask officials of  disaster relief such as those involved in a telethon in Baltimore some years  ago for the benefit of victims of floods in the Eastern states.  </P> <P> Hope has given his life to such activities -- activities to which he has given  his time and talent, more often than not paying his own expenses. And many  times, when local promoters of such events failed in their ticket-selling  endeavors, Hope would buy the unsold tickets, sometimes hundreds of even  thousands of them, out of his own pocket. I know, because for a few years my  wife worked for Bob Hope Enterprises.  </P> <P> Hope does not need me to defend him. There should be no reason for anyone to  have to defend him. But, anyone who believes that Bob is a miser must have  jelly for brains.  </P> <P> If he's a Scrooge, then long live all such Scrooges!  </P> <P> ART MAGEE  </P> <P> Escondido  </P></p>

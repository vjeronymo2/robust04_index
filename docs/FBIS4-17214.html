			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 24 -- The possibility of regulating  conflicts in the Caucasus region and the Balkans is one of the  many things which demands close cooperation between the Russian  Federation and the Republic of Turkey, firmly declared Chairman  of the Russian Duma Ivan Rybkin on Friday as he received  Turkey's National Defence Minister Mehmet Gohlan.    According to the State Duma's press service, the speaker of  the lower chamber of the Federal Assembly told his guest about  the structure and work plans of the State Duma.    In turn, Gohlan expressed Turkey's interest in strengthening  economic and military-technical ties between the two countries.  The defence minister hoped to find in Moscow support and  understanding of Turkey's efforts to solve its energy supply  problems and desire to build heating and nuclear power plants.  In addition, Turkey is looking to Russia for help in  implementing a variety of projects concerning the transportation  of energy resources from Russia to Turkey and transit through  Turkey to other countries in the Mediterranean Sea area.    At the end of his meeting with the Turkish representative,  Rybkin expressed his confidence that inter-parliamentary ties  between the two countries would improve along with economic and  military relations. He accepted Turkish parliamentary leader H.  Cindoruk's invitation to visit Turkey at the head of an official  parliamentary delegation from the Russian Federation.</p>

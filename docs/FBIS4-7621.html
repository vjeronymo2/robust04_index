			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Drazen Budisa, head of the Social Liberal </F> Party, by Norbert Mappes-Niediek; place and date not given: "No  Reason To Rush Things"]    [Text] [Mappes-Niediek] You sharply criticized Croatia's  Bosnia policy. Tudjman has now changed his course. Has harmony  been restored in Croatia?    [Budisa] Croatia's Bosnia policy was double-faced. One  could support what was stated in public, but what actually  happened had nothing to do with it. There is now full agreement  on the federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    [Mappes-Niediek] How do you view the planned confederation  between the Croats and the federative Bosnia?    [Budisa] We have nothing against a confederation. Yet, it  has to be a long process. Besides, there is absolutely no  reason to rush things. When two of the three constituent  nations of Bosnia -- Croats and Muslims -- decide to join  Croatia in a confederation, one can, despite all criticism, not  deny the Bosnian Serbs the right to join Serbia in a  confederation.    [Mappes-Niediek] Your president seems to have a different  view on that.    [Budisa] Tudjman is convinced that it is time to set up a  kind of watershed between two worlds that are politically and  culturally incompatible. Yet, we want to prevent a new cold war  between East and West. As long as Russia is ruled by democrats,  we do not need such a watershed.    [Mappes-Niediek] How do you perceive a solution for Croatian  territories that are held by the Serbs?    [Budisa] We have a very good law on the rights of national  minorities, which has, unfortunately, never been implemented,  not even in that part of Croatia that is controlled by the  government. This has weakened our position in the negotiations.  I am thinking of the many blown-up houses of Serbs, the  difficulties for Serbian citizens to get their certificate of  nationality, and of how the proportional representation of the  Serbs was implemented in Parliament. The Serbs in Croatia  constitute a national community. I think that Croatia will be  forced to go somewhat beyond the regulations for national  minorities. But there will never be a solution that would turn  the Croatian people in any part of Croatia into a minority, as  would be the case in a confederative solution. Look at myself,  for example. I am from Drnis, in Dalmatia. Before the war  20,000 Croats lived there, constituting 70 percent of the  population. Now there are 200. The house I was born in is now  occupied by the Serbian police. For these parts of Croatia  there cannot be Serbian autonomy.    [Mappes-Niediek] As a result of ethnic cleansing, 97 percent  of Serbs now live in Krajina. They are determined not to accept  any solution beneath a confederation.    [Budisa] There cannot be a confederative status for the  entire occupied territory. This would only lead to a new war.  Territorial autonomy can only be had for areas where the Serbs  were a majority before the war -- that is, in the areas around  Knin and Glina.    [Mappes-Niediek] Do you still expect the violent reconquest  of the Krajina by Croatia this spring?    [Budisa] This spring? No. The current talks between the  two sides are obviously going well. Serbia is being more and  more affected by the sanctions, and the Milosevic regime in  Belgrade is also the epicenter for the Krajina Serbs. The other  side may not be cooperative now, but it will be in a few months.</p>

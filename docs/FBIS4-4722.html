			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Reporter's Eye" column, by Pak Kyong-kyun] </F>   [Text] Even if the confusion were created on purpose, it  is difficult to imagine any more confusion resulting from the  series of extremely inconsistent remarks made recently by  high-ranking government officials over the North Korean nuclear  issue.    In a news conference on 29 March for reporters from home and  abroad during President Kim Yong-sam's visit in China,  Ambassador to China Hwang Pyong-tae made remarks which amounted  to saying that "the United States cannot apply sanctions against  North Korea without China's cooperation," which were contrary to  the atmosphere the government was trying to induce of China  joining sanctions against North Korea.    This was followed with Ambassador Hwang's flurry to withdraw  his remarks. Chong Chong-uk, senior presidential aide for  foreign affairs and security, also tried to mitigate the public  stir caused by Hwang's remark by saying that "Ambassador Hwang's  remarks were a mistake," but that came only after we had lost  face on an international scale.    Even before the swell of Ambassador Hwang's remark had been  quelled, another bout of confusion took place domestically on  the evening of 3 April. Attending the discussion session  between ruling party and opposition lawmakers at the Academy  House in Suyuri, Seoul, Vice Foreign Minister Hong Sun-yong  revealed that the government may consider amending its policy on  realizing a South-North envoy exchange prior to North Korea-U.S.  talks.    On the morning of 4 April, however, Chong Chong-uk said that  "Vice Minister Hong's remarks reflect his personal opinion only"  and strongly denied the remarks by saying that "It is absolutely  false." During a monthly morning meeting, Yi Yong-tok, deputy  prime minister and minister of the National Unification Board,  also expressed extreme displeasure by saying: "It is true that  people who lack experience have made some verbal mistakes."  Even Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who is visiting Japan,  stressed: "There is no change in the government policy that the  envoy exchange should be realized before the third round of  North Korean-U.S. talks." Within the space of one day, the  minister and vice minister of one ministry were saying almost  the exact opposite thing. In February, Minister Han also  experienced having to withdraw his remark that "he would  consider a flexible method for deciding on a date and form for  an envoy exchange" because of strong opposition from the other  offices involved, such as Chongwadae [presidential office], the  National Unification Board, and the Agency for National Security  Planning.    Even with the issuance of a statement by the UN Security  Council president, our policy on North Korea remains in disorder  with inconsistent remarks being made by government officials  irrespective of rank. Not to speak of public criticism, one  worries about how our negotiation partner, North Korea, must  view this panorama of confusing developments in our policy on  the North Korean issue.</p>

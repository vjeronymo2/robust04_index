			<p>920203 FT  03 FEB 92 / Letter: An irrational argument Sir, Mr Rigg's letter (January 28) is incorrect, irrational and insulting to our customers and to those employed in, and associated with, the life insurance industry. For the large majority of people in this country life insurance is by far the most popular means of long-term savings. It offers financial protection, peace of mind and pooled investment expertise. This has led to a record of excellent long term returns in a very competitive market place, with millions of satisfied policyholders. Policyholders enjoy the protection of a regulatory framework that has never been stronger. Selling practices, which Mr Rigg attacks, are in particular closely controlled and monitored. Great emphasis is placed on suitability and the long-term nature of the contracts. Michael Pickard, chairman, Life Insurance Council, Association of British Insurers, 51 Gresham Street, London EC2V 7HQ</p>

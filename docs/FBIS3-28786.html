Without  technical accounting factors, the budget will post the first  year-to-year contraction in 39 years.    -- The Finance Ministry plans to issue deficit-coverning  bonds for the first time in five years to make up for revenue  shortfalls stemming mainly from 6 trillion yen tax cuts. The  ministry also plans to issue more construction bonds. As a  result, the ratio of dependence on public borrowings rises to  18.7 percent from 11.2 percent in fiscal 1993.    -- The general operating expenditures will rise only 2.3  percent but public works-related outlays will rise a relatively  high 4.0 percent.    -- Defense spending is up 0.8 percent for the lowest rise  since fiscal 1960 and official development assistance (ODA) will  rise 4.0 percent.    -- The draft fiscal investment and loan program allocates  7.0  percent higher outlays to finance housing, public works and  other projects.</p>

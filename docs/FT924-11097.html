			<p>921028 FT  28 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kodak returns to black as sales rise 5% EASTMAN KODAK, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment, turned in third-quarter net earnings of Dollars 189m, or 58 cents a share, against a deficit of Dollars 118m, or 37 cents, a year ago. Excluding one-time charges in both years, Kodak said its underlying net earnings rose 4 per cent to Dollars 330m, or Dollars 1.01, from Dollars 317m, or 97 cents. Sales in the three months were up 5 per cent to Dollars 5.18bn from Dollars 4.93bn. Kodak warned earlier this month that it would take a Dollars 140m, or 43 cents, charge in the third quarter, when many analysts had expected a more moderate charge of Dollars 45m, or 14 cents. Looking to the fourth quarter, Mr Kay Whitmore, chairman and chief executive, said: 'We believe we can deliver results in line with general expectations, notwithstanding an economic background considerably less supportive than what was foreseen by many.' For the first nine months, Kodak had net earnings of Dollars 847m, or Dollars 2.61, on sales of Dollars 14.78bn, against income of Dollars 417m, or Dollars 1.28, on sales of Dollars 14.34bn last year.</p>

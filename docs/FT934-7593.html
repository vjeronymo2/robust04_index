			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Lebanese unions threaten strike LEBANON'S main labour confederation yesterday rejected a 69.5 per cent government pay increase and called on unions to declare a general strike, agencies report from Beirut. If the unions heed the call in their meeting next Thursday they could threaten Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri's efforts to speed recovery from the effects of the 1975-90 civil war. The Lebanese Labour Union Confederation (CGTL) has also called for demonstrations in all regions of Lebanon as part of a phased plan of action until thepay offer is increased. The government's proposed increase fell well short of the 120 per cent boost, backdated to January 1, that the CGTL had demanded for 350,000 private sector employees and 110,000 public sectorworkers. Riots in Beirut on May 6, 1992, over Lebanon's economic decline toppled then-prime minister Omar Karami. The Hariri government, hoping to satisfy the hard-pressed workers without throwing post-war economic recovery plans off track, agreed a raise which takes the basic monthly minimum wage to LPounds 200,000 (Dollars 116) from LPounds 118,000. But the union argued workers needed more because prices rose 120 percent in 1992 as the Lebanese pound plunged. Mr Fuad Siniora, minister of state for finance, said the pay rise would cost the treasury up to LPounds 215bn pounds in 1994 but meeting the CGTL's full demands would have doubled the cost to the treasury and hit private employers hard.</p>

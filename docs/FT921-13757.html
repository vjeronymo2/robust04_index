			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Letter: Seekers of truth Sir, We hacks must surely bow to Howard Davies's idea (Personal View, January 15) that newspaper reports be judged for accuracy by the government or corporate press officers involved. Who is paid to tell the truth if not they? Why rely on some wretched political editor when the unvarnished facts are available from a Bernard Ingham? But Mr Davies does not cast his net wide enough. Newspapers are not the only publishers. His own Audit Commission - just for example - puts out numerous reports on local government. These could be judged by an objective committee of council press officers from, say, Liverpool, Hammersmith and West Wiltshire (plus, maybe, to add some Scottish financial acumen, Western Isles). Couldn't they? Stephen Hugh-Jones, The Economist, 25 St James's Street, London SW1A 1HG</p>

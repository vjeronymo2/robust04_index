Flores asked government leader Pedro Simon to ask the Senate to  immediately approve the two nuclear nonproliferation treaties to  avoid retaliatory measures against Brazil.    Flores said: "There is no reason to fear the ratification of  the agreement if we do not intend to build the atomic bomb." He  made this statement following Germany's threat to break the  nuclear agreement and suspend the transfer of technology to  Brazil.    The Senate today will only vote on the proposal by Senator  Dirceu Carneiro (PMDB-SC [Brazilian Democratic Movement  Party-Santa Catarina]) in favor of the approval of one of the  nuclear safeguard agreements. According to the agreement,  Brazil, Argentina, the Abacc (Brazilian-Argentine Agency for  Accounting and Control), and the AIEA agree to supervise the  production of nuclear material restricting technological  development to peaceful purposes, safeguard nuclear secrets, and  authorize the Navy to build a nuclear submarine. Brazil does  not have to reveal its technological secrets. Should an  inspection be carried out, Brazil will not be forced to reveal  how it enriches uranium.    The possibility of overcoming the impasse affecting the  ratification of the Tlatelolco Treaty that bans nuclear weapons  in Latin America seems difficult. Carneiro, coordinator of the  legislative decree on the treaty, has imposed a new condition:  the elimination of an article allowing special inspections at  nuclear plants at the request of a third country. But, at  Itamaraty's request, Senate President Humberto Lucena has put  the agreement on the list of issues to be voted on today without  being submitted to the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Contrary to Lucena's decision, Carneiro has requested that  the agreement be eliminated from the list of issues to be voted  on. He wants the four-party agreement to be given priority  treatment. Carneiro said reports that Germany intends to break  the nuclear agreement due to the Senate's delay in approving the  nuclear safeguards are "illogical and untrue." According to  him, "the Tlatelolco Treaty is a regional treaty to ban nuclear  weapons from Latin America, and it has nothing to do with the  agreement with Germany that contemplated the construction of  eight nuclear plants. None of which were built."</p>

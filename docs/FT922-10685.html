			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Congress asked to extend federal regulation of insurance industry: A bill seeking SEC-type regulation THE US Congress, undaunted by its failure last year to pass coherent legislation on the banking industry, is turning its attention to insurance. Mr John Dingell, chairman of the House of Representatives energy and commerce committee, has put forward a draft bill which would set up a federal regulatory agency for the insurance industry, modelled along the same lines as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) which oversees the capital markets. Mr Dingell's bill would set up a federal certificate of solvency which would authorise an insurer to write policies anywhere in the US without any other regulation of its financial condition. Foreign insurers applying for this federal certificate would have to set up a trust fund in the US to satisfy the commission of their ability to meet their policy holders' claims. Companies engaged in reinsurance would, under Mr Dingell's proposal, have to meet tougher capital standards. The Dingell bill matches in many respects a proposal made last year by Senator Howard Metzenbaum, although Mr Dingell does not go as far as Senator Metzenbaum in transferring insurance regulation from the states to the federal government. He would leave the regulation of insurance premiums to each state. Pressure for some measure of federal regulation in the US insurance industry arises for two basic reasons. The first is that the existing system of state regulation, dating from the mid-19th century, is widely seen to have flaws. Each state enacts its own laws, runs its own insurance department, operates its own guarantee funds and has its own insurance commissioner. The commissioner may be either elected or appointed by other state officials. Where he is elected, insurance matters tend to develop an even thicker political coating. For example, John Garamendi, the first elected commissioner in California, is an ambitious Democrat, thought to have his eyes on the governor's job. Many observers believe that his high-profile actions - which have ranged from the seizure of First Executive, the large life company, to an ongoing court battle to get car insurance rollbacks paid out - are part of a larger political agenda. It is true that, as insurance companies have become bigger and more complex, the states have developed a fair degree of consistency. There is, for instance, a standard format for financial reports. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, moreover, regularly formulates 'model' laws, which often form the basis for state legislation. Nevertheless, most industry practitioners acknowledge that regulatory standards vary substantially from state to state. Differences in state guarantee fund arrangements, which underpin policyholders' contracts, have also been highlighted recently - during, for example, the First Executive debacle. A small minority of states still lack guarantee arrangements for certain types of contract: even California, a big insurance market, only recently enacted a life/health guarantee fund. Anxious to deflect federal oversight, the NAIC responsed with a new approval system in June 1990. By formally 'accrediting' those states whose financial standards conform to (or better) its model rulebook and whose supervisory resources are deemed adequate, the NAIC hopes to presslaggard states into improvements. So far, nine states have met the NAIC's standards, and more accreditations may come in June. But however intelligent and well-intentioned this response, critics of state regulation still see a fundamental flaw: the NAIC has no legal powers to compel the sloppier states to do anything. The second reason for disquiet with the state-based regulatory system is simpler still. Like other financial services businesses, insurers are counting the cost of over-ambitious expansion in the heady Eighties. Attention has centred primarily on the investment side of the business. Some of the largest composite insurers - such as Aetna or Travelers - are busily buttressing revenues to cover souring real estate-related holdings. Heavy junk bond holdings, meanwhile, prompted policyholder runs, and subsequent seizures, at First Executive, First Capital and others. But the writing of some policies has been injudicious, too: witness Equitable Life's problem with its 'guaranteed investment contracts' (essentially savings contracts which promised an ambitious rate of return). Meanwhile, on the property-casualty (non-life, non-health) side, few think that the underwriting cycle has really begun to turn, and the move towards 'self-insurance' - as customers seek to defray the cost of mounting premiums  -leads some pundits to believe that the cycle is undergoing a fundamental structural change. In short, the health of the industry is not good. The problem is summed up by figures of insurance company failures. According to A. M. Best, the specialist rating agency, 271 property-casualty companies have either been 'involuntarily dissolved' or placed under state supervision over the past eight years, compared with 62 in the previous eight years. Forty-six property-casualty companies had to shut their doors involuntarily last year, the second-highest figure for more than a decade and a 44 per cent increase on the 32 in 1990. Another 28 life/health companies were also declared impaired or insolvent last year. The Dingell bill seems to have generated a good deal of reading - 'It's the size of the telephone book,' complained one New York-based insurance executive - and relatively little public comment. The NAIC has set up a working group to review the bill and expects to put out a detailed response in the summer. Many of the largest insurers are publicly supportive of the NAIC's stance. 'The NAIC has been working very hard to improve solvency regulation,' commented Met Life, 'and the federal government has a pretty poor record when it comes to financial institutions - especially the thrifts.' Insurers also point out that they have a vested interest in good solvency regulation at present - since, when a call is made on a state guarantee fund, it is other insurers functioning in the same state who retroactively supply funds. Perhaps one of the fiercest criticisms of the Dingell proposals is that it would make solvency oversight a federal matter, yet leave pricing and product supervision with the states. That said, executives at some large, multistate companies concede privately that a federal oversight agency might make life simpler. And, like the NAIC, they generally accept that the federal government could usefully play a role in matters of fraud and the regulation of non-US insurance companies operating in the US. Perhaps the final disincentive for congressmen is Mr Dingell's plan to establish a National Insurance Protection Corporation to cover the claims of policyholders whose insurers become insolvent. Mr Dingell argues that this corporation would be pre-funded by a risk-based levy on insurance companies. But most congressmen have been so badly burnt by the experience of paying for insolvent savings and loans and banks that they are unlikely to show much enthusiasm for extending the federal umbrella over insurance policyholders.</p>

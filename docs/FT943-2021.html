			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / International Company News: Bertelsmann profits rise 15% Bertelsmann, the German media group, boosted net profits 15 per cent to DM759m (Dollars 489m) for the year to June 30, helped by rapidly expanding US operations. Mr Mark Wossner, chief executive, said conditions had become more difficult in the first quarter of this year as margins tightened in the printing business, excluding newspapers, which generates about 20 per cent of group profits. However, he said earnings this year would improve slightly, helped by an economic recovery in Germany. He forecast that turnover would reach DM20.8bn. Turnover rose 7.2 per cent last year to DM18.4bn, helped by a strong dollar. Accounting for currency movements, turnover was up 5.9 per cent. The annual profit was struck after the group wrote-off DM435m for start-up costs for Vox, Premiere and other television and music ventures. Writes-offs for Vox, the financially troubled television station in which Bertelsmann holds a 24.9 per cent stake, exceeded DM100m. Mr Wossner said that book clubs and all print media interests remained the most profitable divisions, contributing 80 per cent of net profits. Adjusting for currency movements, US turnover rose 13 per cent to DM6.9bn and accounted for a third of operating profits of DM1.49bn. The Bertelsmann music group, based mainly in the US, saw sales rise 16 per cent to DM5.3bn. Foreign activities made up about 67 per cent of sales and the company forecast that this share would rise to around 75 per cent in 2000.</p>

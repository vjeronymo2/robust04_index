			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Hozelock profit forecast increased after hot summer Shares in Hozelock yesterday climbed 13p to a post-flotation high of 286p after the garden equipment manufacturer forecast higher than expected profits following Britain's hottest summer for more than 10 years. The company, which came to the market last November at 250p, said the dry weather had increased demand for products which include sprinklers and pond pumps. Although the shares dipped to 232p in March after heavy spring rainfall, the group said it was set fair for the rest of the year. 'It's been a great summer. Productivity has improved and we've had to retain temporary workers who would normally have been laid off in June', said Mr David Codling, the chief executive. His comments persuaded City analysts to upgrade their full year profit forecasts from Pounds 6m to Pounds 6.75m. The group also expects to exploit increased demand with the opening next month of a new Pounds 8.5m factory at Sutton Coldfield, in the Midlands. Mr Codling said the plant would increase production capacity by 50 per cent and increase the peak season workforce to more than 700. Trading in continental Europe, meanwhile, was starting to pick up following a slow first half.</p>

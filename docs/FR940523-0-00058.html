			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> E. Documentation Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Section 765.20 of the proposed rule required that each claim for reimbursement of costs of remedial action be supported by adequate documentation. All costs for which reimbursement was sought and all supporting documentation were to be organized and cross-referenced to specific requirements or activities in an approved reclamation plan. Further, the proposed rule expressed a preference for documentation that was prepared contemporaneously to the time the costs were incurred. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A number of commenters questioned the use of the word ``adequate'' to describe the documentation necessary to support a claim for reimbursement. Section 1002 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 2296a&hyph;1)) requires a licensee to submit a claim together with ``reasonable'' documentation. In the final rule, the word ``adequate'' has been replaced with ``reasonable'' in &sect;765.20(a) to make the language of the rule consistent with that of Title X. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule also generated several comments concerning the amount and type of documentation necessary. Many commenters contended that the documentation requirements were unduly burdensome. Several commenters recommended that the Department consider accepting a summary of the available documentation, while reserving the right to audit the actual documentation at the licensee's facility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a result of these comments, the Department has modified the documentation requirements in the final rule to specifically permit the submission of claims that summarize the supporting documentation, without requiring the submission of all supporting documentation with the claim itself. Under the final rule, licensees may submit a claim which outlines all costs of remedial action for which reimbursement is sought and summarizes the documentation available to support the claim. The Department may audit or may require the licensee to audit, on a case-by-case basis, any documents used in support of a claim. Under the final rule, licensees are still required to organize and cross-reference summary documentation supporting a claim to the activity or requirement established in the reclamation plan, or other written authorization for both pre- and post-UMTRCA costs of remedial action, in order to facilitate such an audit. These documents also must be retained by each licensee until 4 years after final payment of a claim is made by the Department, access to which must be made available to the Department upon request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, many commenters indicated that contemporaneous documentation might not be available to support claims. Various reasons, including the passage of time since costs were incurred, were provided to support the request that non-contemporaneous documentation be permitted to support the claim for reimbursement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule did not prohibit the use of non-contemporaneous documentation. Instead it established a preference, but not a requirement, for contemporaneous documentation. The final rule has been clarified to indicate that documentation prepared contemporaneous to the time the costs were incurred should be used where available. To support a claim for reimbursement, the most appropriate documentation, but not the only acceptable documentation, is documentation that was prepared contemporaneous to the time the cost was incurred. If contemporaneous documentation is not available, &sect;765.20(d)(2) provides that non-contemporaneous documentation may be submitted, provided that the documentation is the only means available to document the costs for which reimbursement is sought. This approach reflects the Department's understanding that Title X establishes a test of reasonableness regarding the level of documentation necessary to support a claim for reimbursement. The level of documentation that reasonably can be expected will depend on the specific circumstances involved in each claim, including the time that has elapsed since the costs were incurred and the activity for which costs were incurred. The Department intends to evaluate each claim on a case-by-case basis using this standard of reasonableness. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some commenters requested that &sect;765.20(e) of the proposed rule be revised to exclude the requirement that the licensee certify that a quality assurance program was implemented. The Department has determined that this certification is not required by the Act, but rather is a responsibility of NRC or an Agreement State. Therefore, this requirement has been deleted from the final rule. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, one commenter encouraged the Department to provide a standardized claims format guide so that guidance for preparing claims will be available to licensees when the rule is finalized. The Department is preparing guidance to aid licensees in claim submission procedures. This guide will be distributed to eligible licensees shortly after publication of the final rule. In addition, the guide will be made available to other interested parties upon written request to the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action Project Office, U.S. Department of Energy, 2155 Louisiana NE., suite 10000, Albuquerque, NM 87110, or by visiting the Department of Energy's Freedom of Information Reading Room, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, from 9:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

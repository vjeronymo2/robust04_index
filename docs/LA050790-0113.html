			<p><P> May 7, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DIANA'S JET LANDS FOR REPAIR  </P> <P> A royal jet carrying Princess Diana was forced to make an emergency landing  today because of an electrical problem that cropped up just after takeoff on  the first leg of a visit to Hungary.  </P> <P> Engineers repaired the problem and the 28-year-old princess of Wales and her  entourage later left on the first official visit to a Warsaw Pact nation by  members of the House of Windsor, authorities said.  </P> <P> The first stop was to be in Ancona, Italy, where the royal party was to pick up  Prince Charles, Diana's husband and the heir to the British throne, before  flying on to the Hungarian capital of Budapest. Prince Charles was in Italy to  open his first exhibition of watercolor paintings.  </P> <P> The unspecified electrical fault was detected shortly after the BAE-146  aircraft -- manned by the Queen's Flight, members of the Royal Air Force --  took off from London's Heathrow Airport, authorities said. The pilot  immediately diverted to London's nearby Gatwick Airport, where the problem was  solved. The princess and her party of about 20 remained aboard the aircraft  while British Airways engineers fixed the problem.  </P></p>

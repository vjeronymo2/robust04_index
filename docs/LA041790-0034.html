			<p><P> April 17, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: LOS PADRES;  </P> <P> 600-ACRE BLAZE IGNITED BY CAMPFIRE  </P> <P> An unattended campfire caused a fire that continued to burn Monday in the Los  Padres National Forest, authorities said.  </P> <P> More than 280 firefighters battled the fire, which had spread to 600 acres  Monday, said Earl Clayton, a spokesman.  </P> <P> Split into 15 hand crews and four helicopter crews, they dropped water on the  fire, cut firebreaks and dug trenches.  </P> <P> "This is in an area where the terrain is extremely rugged," Clayton said. "We  couldn't get to the fire by engines. . . . The roads are almost impassable."  </P> <P> Four firefighters have suffered minor injuries, primarily from heat exhaustion,  since the fire began Friday, Clayton said. Damage to acres of pinion and  juniper pine is estimated at $300,000, he said.  </P> <P> By 4:30 p.m. Monday, 90% of the fire had been contained, Clayton said. The  cloud cover that moved in Monday morning helped slow its spread, Clayton said.  </P> <P> "The really unusual thing about this fire is that it occurs here in April, not  in June and July," Clayton said. Because of the four-year statewide drought,  the fire danger is the most severe in a century in the national forest, he  said. PEGGY Y. LEE  </P></p>

The magazine ranked Cosby first, hailing him as  "the most successful entertainer in history," and praised runner-up Hagman for  the "campy finesse" with which he portrays J. R. Ewing. The rest of TV Guide's  list of 20 top TV personalities of the decade: Oprah Winfrey, Ronald Reagan  ("the first made-for-TV president"), Joan Collins, Ted Koppel, Vanna White,  David Letterman, Michael J. Fox, Tom Selleck, the California Raisins, Sam  Donaldson, John Madden, Hulk Hogan, Don Johnson, Dan Rather, Roseanne Barr,  Morton Downey Jr., ALF and Pee-Wee Herman.. . . . Bugs Bunny, Popeye and Santa  Claus were on hand, but Mr. Belvedere was a no-show at the Dallas Christmas  parade Saturday. Christopher Hewitt, who plays Mr. Belvedere on the television  series of the same name, called in his regrets, explaining that he was still  recovering from injuries suffered when he fell off a float during the Hollywood  Christmas parade.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: EL MONTE;  </P> <P> SUBDIVISION APPEAL DENIED  </P> <P> Time finally ran out Tuesday for a proposed subdivision on Edwards Avenue south  of Garvey Avenue.  </P> <P> The City Council upheld the Planning Commission's May 21 ruling against the  eight-home project, despite testimony from neighbors. The neighbors said the  project would bring improvements to an area plagued by drug trafficking.  </P> <P> Owner Fun S. Psang had appealed the Planning Commission ruling and proposed  widening Edwards Avenue.  </P> <P> In rejecting the proposal last May, the commission said Edwards, a short  private road, was unsuitable for a project of that density. City Planning  Director Harold Johanson said Tuesday that although Psang's changes improved  the project, additional study of the proposal was needed.  </P></p>

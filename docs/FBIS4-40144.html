			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Tallinn, June 11, BNS -- Prime Minister Mart  Laar took a landslide victory Saturday in a vote for the  chairmanship of Pro Patria, the senior party in Estonia's ruling  coalition. Whether this also means that Laar will continue as  prime minister and that the Pro Patria-led rightist coalition  will remain in power becomes clear after the four other  coalition parties have announced their position on the issue.  [passage omitted]    Laar in remarks after his victory said that allegations  about  Pro Patria's dissolution or abandoning of the political scene  didn't hold true and that "there is much more that unites us  than what separates us."    Laar in an interview with BNS said the decision made by the  party general meeting had been a clearer one than anybody could  have expected. "How strong will Pro Patria come out of the  crisis now depends on what we do next and whether or not the  diversities within Pro Patria can be healed," he said.    It now hangs on the decision of Pro Patria's coalition  partners whether or not Laar can also continue as prime minister.    The parliament's deputy chairman, National Independence  Party's Tunne Kelam told BNS Pro Patria's coalition partners had  never unconditionally demanded that Laar should leave, but added  that Laar's remaining in office had to be agreed upon with his  and the other three parties in the coalition.    The so-called "small coalition", or the ruling parties  beside  Pro Patria, earlier have said they would announce their prime  minister candidate Monday. Laar's rival candidate in Saturday's  vote, parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis has predicted that the  legislative body will fail Laar in a confidence vote.    Also one of Laar's fiercest rivals, his Cabinet's recently  resigned Defense Minister Indrek Kannik, told BNS Saturday that  the future of the current government depended on what the small  coalition was going to decide. But Kannik declined to predict  the outcome of a possible parliamentary confidence vote.    Parliament Chairman Ulo Nugis, showing regret over entering  the conflict, said the election outcome for him had been an  unexpected one. "If it wasn't for the coalition partners'  proposal, I maybe shouldn't have become active in the election  of the party chairman," he said.    The parliament leader said he had his own way in politics  that didn't include becoming a prime minister. He added that  what he did had been aimed at resolving the government crisis  and helping the party on its way toward the next elections.    Kaido Kama in comments on the election outcome said he  considered a split in Pro Patria unlikely. "There are no major  program-related diversities between different wings in Pro  Patria," Kama said. But he added that Laar's re-election was no  solution for problems inside the party.    Finance Minister Heiki Kranich said he will hold his promise  and step down. Kranich already last month said he will resign  if the party congress re-elects Laar as chairman.    Kama after the vote said that his anti-Laar party suffered a  defeat because having been unable to bring enough members of the  anti-Laar opposition to the congress.    Kama said it would have been possible to bring some hundred  more anti-Laar Pro Patria members to the congress.    All rival candidates in their remarks to the meeting before  the vote criticized Mart Laar for failures in his performance as  prime minister.    Kama warned the Pro Patria members that the party can retain  good relations with its partners in the ruling coalition only if  a new prime minister from Pro Patria is appointed to office.  Kama promised before the vote that he as party chairman would  "correct Laar's biggest mistake and restore a united team," and  act according to guidelines by the party general meeting.    Ulo Nugis in his remarks said Pro Patria's coalition  partners  wanted to have a new prime minister.    "I have more power at the moment than the ruling party,  because I have the support of a great deal of the parliament and  of the Estonian people. Therefore, I was out for nothing when  running for chairmanship -- I just wanted to extend my helping  hand (to Pro Patria)," Nugis said. [passage omitted]</p>

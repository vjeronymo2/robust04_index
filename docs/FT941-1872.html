			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Linde acquires gasworks Linde, the German engineering concern, yesterday announced the acquisition of a Hungarian facility producing industrial gases. The German group is to take over the air separation and oxygen production works in Dunaujvaros in central Hungary, previously operated by Dunaferr, the state-owned steel producer. Although the purchase price was not disclosed, Linde said the acquisition and other developments planned for 1994 would take their total investment to DM125m (Dollars 73.5m) for Hungary and DM400m for the central-east European region as a whole. Linde outbid Messer Griesheim, the subsidiary of German chemical group Hoechst, to win the Dunaferr assets. The deal leaves the Hungarian industrial gases market divided primarily between the two German groups. Mr Gunnar Eggendorfer, Linde board member, said demand for industrial gases was expected to grow faster than the economy as a whole. He said Linde hoped to extend the use of the products made at the facility.</p>

Under the directive of oblast administration head  Aleksandr Belyakov, 219 volosts have been formed to replace 230  village soviets. Executive power in them will be exercised by  headmen [starosta]. The oblast administration is also receding  into the past: It is being transformed into the government of  Leningrad Oblast. The head of the administration becomes  chairman of the Council of Ministers and simultaneously  governor, while his four deputies are elevated to the rank of  vice premiers. Instead of departments, ministries are now being  created. For the time being the territory of Leningrad Oblast  will retain administrative rayons to be led by the rayon  administration. But the new government does not rule out the  possibility that they will in time be transformed into uyezds.</p>

			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> PURGE ORDERED IN KOSOVO  </P> <P> Communist leaders in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo ordered a major purge of  officials blamed for widespread rioting by ethnic Albanians there. The decision  by the party's Central Committee to fire officials in institutions ranging from  Parliament to trade unions came after the worst violence that Yugoslavia has  seen since the Balkan federation was created in 1948. Official figures put the  death toll at 24 in a week of street battles and shooting. All the protests  opposed attempts by Serbia, Yugoslavia's biggest republic, to curb the powers  of Kosovo, an autonomous province within the republic. Ethnic Albanians make up  about 90% of Kosovo's population.  </P></p>

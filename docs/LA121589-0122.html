			<p><P> December 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> One-Year T-Bill Rates Fall: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills fell to  the lowest level since June, 1988. The Treasury sold $9.75 billion of new bills  at an average discount rate of 7.14%, down from 7.17% at the last auction Nov.  16. The rates were the lowest since June 30, 1988, when the one-year bills sold  for 7.04%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to investors --  7.66%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,278.10.  </P></p>

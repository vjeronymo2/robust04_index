			<p>BFN     [Text] A UNIAN correspondent was informed by the Japanese  Embassy in Ukraine that out of the $100 million allocated by the  Japanese Government to dismantling the nuclear weapons of  Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, our country will  receive $16 million, with Japan expecting specific projects [to  be implemented] by Ukraine using this money.    Ukraine's Foreign Affairs Ministry says that both countries  are in the process of drafting a joint declaration on the  principles of cooperation between Ukraine and Japan, a  memorandum of understanding between the two states' foreign  political departments, and an intergovernmental agreement on the  mutual encouragement and protection of investments, as well as  working to settle the issue of Ukraine's legal succession with  regard to the contractual and legal basis that was formed in  relations between Japan and the former USSR.</p>

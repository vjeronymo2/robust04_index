			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (11): Aiming to rise to the top - Profile, Mayor Karayalcin of Ankara FEW JOBS in Turkey are quite as thankless as that of mayor of Ankara. Trying to satisfy the insatiable expectations an electorate for rapid benefits in the quality of life while having to rely on inadequate financial and administrative resources is a daunting prospect for even the most ambitious politician. None of the mayors of the Turkish capital in the last 15 years has served more than one term in office and none has made a successful transition to national politics. Even Mr Bedrettin Dalan, the ultra-popular Motherland party mayor of Istanbul in the 1980s, sits as a backbencher in Mr Demirel's True Path party. At seven o'clock in the evening on a typical working day, Mr Murat Karayalcin, Ankara's social democratic mayor, still has a chaotic and gruelling schedule ahead of him. Crowds of visitors mill around in the anteroom to the mayor's office. The streets outside are even more chaotic: in normal times they are the main arteries for the city's traffic. Now, they have been closed to traffic for months. Only a few of them will make it to the relative calm of the mayor's inner sanctum, a grandiose dark-panelled room inherited by Mr Karayalcin from his predecessors. Once inside they meet a quiet, unpretentious social democrat, who plays down political antagonisms between himself and his predecessors and has more the flavour of the civil servant or technocrat about him than that of Tammany Hall. Yet Mr Karayalcin is clearly an ambitious man, who is pledged to making Ankara one of the best cities in the region and is widely tipped as an eventual leader of Turkey's social democrats some day if he ever does make the transition to national politics. Meanwhile Mr Karayalcin is trying to leave lasting imprint on a teeming city of 2.8m people. Though much smaller and more orderly than Istanbul, Ankara lacks some of its rival's advantages: it is not primarily a business centre but an administrative capital. There is much less wealth around and also a less glittering cultural life, though Ankara has been a large and important city since pre-Roman times. Like most of his voters, Mr Karayalcin was not born in the city he now presides over, but was brought up on the Black Sea coast, arriving in Ankara in his late teens for high school and university. He cut his political teeth in student politics in the late 1960s and early 1970s and graduated from the political science faculty of Ankara University, the training ground of the Turkish civil service. In the middle 1970s, he spent two years at the institute of development studies of the University of East Anglia in the UK studying urban-biased models for economic development. He retains fairly strong links with the UK. When the social democrats were in office in Turkey at the end of the 1970s, Mr Karayalcin became an undersecretary in the Ministry of Rural Affairs and then worked in the city's municipal administration and was appointed head of Batikent, a large co-operative housing development on the west of Ankara, organising the construction of 200,000 housing units. The aim behind the Batikent project was to develop services and housing well outside the traditional boundaries of Ankara and so relieve pressure on the congested centre of the city. A year or two after the project got going, the 1980 Turkish military coup swept away the country's civilian political system. The social democrat mayor of Ankara was replaced by a retired general whose most striking action as the capital's mayor was to order that all the houses in the citadel should be painted blue, apparently to discourage rodents. Mr Karayalcin kept a low profile through the years of military rule and unlike almost every other social democrat official managed to remain at his post. The Batikent project moved ahead. When democracy began to make a gradual return to Turkey in 1983, Mr Karayalcin rejected advances from the Motherland party and joined the newly-founded Social Democracy Populist party (SHP) of Mr Erdal Inonu and in 1989, he ran successfully for mayor. He has generally supported Mr Inonu, rather than his rivals in the fierce factional in-fighting which dogs the SHP. 'Life is difficult at the moment for social democrats all over the world, not just in Turkey,' says Mr Karayalcin. 'We have to work out some sort of practical response to the ideological challenges we are facing.' As mayor however Mr Karayalcin's sights have been set on less contentious matters such as infrastructural projects, ranging from the conversion of Ankara's gas supply to natural gas to new light rail and road systems. He is a good administrator and the changes have meant less disruption to the daily life of the capital's population than has been the case in Istanbul. Nevertheless, his fortunes are clearly bound up with the future of Turkey's ailing and bitterly divided social democratic movement. Mr Karayalcin sees a fresh chance to reunite it in current efforts to revive the pre-1980 Republican People's Party, shut down along with other parties by the military junta in 1981 in what Mr Karayalcin describes as a legal disaster. 'Its closure was a mistake and putting it right would be a suitable opportunity to reunite the left-of-centre in Turkey,' the mayor says. Founded by Ataturk, modern Turkey's founder and national hero, in 1923, the RPP was Turkey's largest party in the 1970s and none of its post-coup successors has ever managed fully to take its place. The parliamentary centre-left in Turkey is currently divided into four or five bickering factions, split between three parties. So does Mr Karayalcin plan to go into national politics? Asked directly about his intentions, he replies cautiously: 'A politician always has to be ready to take on any position and rise in his own party as high as he possibly can.' If he ever does go into parliament, he may eventually emerge as a consensus candidate for the eventual succession to Mr Inonu. But that is unlikely to be in the lifetime of the present parliament. In the meantime, Mr Karayalcin will have his work cut out making Ankara into the fairest capital city of the Mediterranean.</p>

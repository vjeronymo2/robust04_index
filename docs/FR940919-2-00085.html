			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The process starts at the initial level when an individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first applies for DI and/or SSI benefits on the basis of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disabling physical or mental condition. An individual calls the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> national toll-free telephone number and is referred to a local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA field office or visits or calls one of 1,300 local field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices to apply for benefits. Field office personnel assist with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application completion, obtain detailed medical and vocational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> history and screen nonmedical eligibility factors. Field office  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel forward the claim to 1 of 54 State DDSs where medical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evidence is developed and a final decision is made regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existence of a medically determinable impairment which meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> definition of disability. The decision is made by an adjudicative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> team consisting of a disability specialist and a program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> physician.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After possible quality assurance review in the DDS or in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SSA regional Disability Quality Branch, the claim is returned to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the field office; denials are retained pending possible appeal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In FY 1993, 39 percent of initial claims were allowed and sent to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1 of 7 processing centers (which include the Office of Disability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and International Operations and the 6 Program Service Centers)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for final processing and storage, as well as adjudication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims for dependents. Allowed SSI claims remain in the field  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> office for payment effectuation and folder retention. A sample of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these are reviewed after payment for nondisability quality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assurance. According to SSA's computer-based processing time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measurements, an initial claim currently takes an average of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 100 days to process from the time of filing until a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision is made. However, from the claimant's perspective, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better understanding of how long the process takes comes from a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993 study conducted by SSA <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s Office of Workforce Analysis, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showed that an average claimant waits up to 155 days from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial contact with SSA until receiving an initial claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision notice. During this period, 16 to 26 employees will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handle the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The claimant may request reconsideration of the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision within 60 days of receiving the denial notice. In FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, claimants requested reconsideration in 48 percent of denied  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims. Local field office personnel receive the reconsideration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request, update necessary information, and forward the claim file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the DDS for review, possible medical development, and a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> medical decision. The reconsideration decision is made by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different adjudicative team than the one that made the initial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After possible quality assurance review in the DDS or in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regional Disability Quality Branch, about 14 percent of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims are returned to the field office for payment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forwarding to a processing center; the remaining denials are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forwarded to the field office for retention, pending possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further appeal. According to SSA <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> s computer-based processing time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, the average reconsideration takes about 50 days_however, according to the Office of Workforce Analysis study, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimant has now been involved with the disability process for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> roughly 8 months from the initial contact with SSA, and up to 36  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different employees could have handled the claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A claimant can request a hearing before an ALJ within 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of receiving an unfavorable reconsideration decision. In FY  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1993, claimants requested an ALJ hearing in about 75 percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all reconsideration denials. By this time, a claimant has usually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retained an attorney or other representative to assist in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuing the claim for benefits. About 75 percent of all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claimants retain a representative at the hearing level. Local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> field office personnel receive the request for hearing and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forward it with the claim file to one of 132 local SSA hearings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> offices. Hearing office personnel review the file for possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional development, conduct a hearing, and render a decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DI claims allowed at the hearing level are sent to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processing center for payment effectuation and adjudication of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims for dependents, and storage. Allowed SSI claims are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> returned to the local field office for income and resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development, and payment. Denied claims are forwarded to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appeals Council for retention pending a possible request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review. According to computer-based reports, the hearing process  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takes about 265 days. However, according to the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Workforce Analysis study, a claimant has been dealing with SSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for over a year and a half at this point in the process.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

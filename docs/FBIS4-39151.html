			<p>Ready   To Work With Kiev After Group Meeting Ends   <F P=102> LD0306174694 Moscow INTERFAX in English 1603 GMT 3 Jun 94 </F> <F P=103> LD0306174694 </F> <F P=104>  Moscow INTERFAX </F> <F P=105>  English </F> BFN     [Text] The two-day talks in Simferopol between the  Ukrainian and Crimean parliamentary delegations resulted in  decision to set up a permanent joint parliamentary working group  on social and economic issues.    Moreover, a joint working group will be established in order  to bring the Crimean legislation in conformity with the  Ukrainian constitution and laws.    A Crimean delegation member, Chairman of the parliamentary  Commission on State Construction Sergey Nikulin told  INTERFAX-Ukraine that Crimean and Ukrainian parliamentarians had  agreed that Crimean and Ukrainian legislation did not conform  with each other on many points.    Nikulin said that this resulted in the inability of Crimea  to  pursue an independent economic policy.    He said that the issues on a treaty basis for bilateral  relations and dual citizenship had not been discussed during the  talks.    During the last month Ukrainian-Crimean relations were  focused on the treaty basis for relations and on dual  citizenship. The Crimean parliament restored this provision  when re-establishing the Crimean constitution of 6 May 1992.  The Ukrainian parliament disagreed with this and adopted the  appropriate decision on 20 May urging the Crimean parliament to  go back to the former version of the Constitution.    Nikulin stressed that this issue could be re-considered  after  Ukraine adopted its new constitution.    Commenting on the talks, Nikulin said that the Crimean  delegation was even surprised with the complete understanding of  its position by Kiev. "We want and we are ready to work  together," he added.    This evening the Ukrainian parliamentary delegation will  leave for Kiev.</p>

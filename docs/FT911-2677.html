			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Japan warns US on construction row TOKYO has warned that it may retaliate if Washington restricts Japanese contractors' involvement in US government-funded projects, as a means to open Japan's construction market. A US announcement that sanctions would be imposed after 30 days, unless a market-opening agreement were achieved, has angered Japanese officials, who say the threat will hinder bilateral negotiations on the construction market. Tokyo officials were surprised by Washington's announcement, as they had assumed US threats were a negotiating ploy and did not expect the administration to set sanctions in motion. Mr Misoji Sakamoto, Japan's chief cabinet secretary, said the two countries were nearing a conclusion in the construction talks - Washington's decision was 'regrettable'. He said the unilateral action was in breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and might provoke retaliation by Japan. The US threats follow unsuccessful attempts to supersede a 1988 market-opening agreement which provided help for US companies in 14 designated public works projects, including a new airport near Osaka which has been the site of trade disputes over the past year. Washington wants the list of projects extended, claiming Japan's construction market is still effectively closed. Tokyo has argued that the first agreement was intended to provide experience for US companies and that they should not continue to receive special assistance. Behind the US action is the belief that Japanese construction companies routinely organise cartels and rig bids, and that, without special assistance, US companies will struggle to win contracts. Japanese officials say the market is open and contracts are decided on merit. Japan's Fair Trade Commission in the past two years has uncovered several big construction cartels, including one for the Osaka airport project and another which had rigged bids for contracts at US military bases in Japan.</p>

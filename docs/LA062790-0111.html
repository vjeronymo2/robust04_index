			<p><P> June 27, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDATION FUNDS PROVIDE ASSIST TO CELEBRATED TEACHER ESCALANTE  </P> <P> The Scientology movement's Foundation for Advancements in Science and Education  has befriended one of America's most celebrated teachers, Jaime Escalante of  Garfield High School.  </P> <P> Escalante is the East Los Angeles teacher profiled in the hit 1988 film "Stand  and Deliver," which chronicled his success in teaching advanced calculus to  barrio students.  </P> <P> During the last few years, the foundation has provided Escalante with tens of  thousands of dollars for computers, audiovisual aids, tutors and scholarships.  In addition, the foundation has solicited contributions from major corporations  to help Escalante's Garfield High mathematics program grow in size and  sophistication.  </P> <P> In fact, the foundation has been Escalante's primary benefactor.  </P> <P> He is now teaming up with the foundation to develop a series of 12 educational  videos for distribution by the Public Broadcasting System. Called "Futures,"  the series is intended to motivate students by showing them the relevancy of  math in the workplace. The foundation's president will be the executive  producer, while Escalante will be host of the series.  </P> <P> Escalante says he was unaware of the foundation's links to Scientology. "No,  no," he said, "they (foundation officials) never mentioned that name." But, he  added, it makes no difference.  </P> <P> "From my point of view," he said, "I really don't mind what they are. The only  thing I care about is that they help my students, my kids. That's my main  goal."  </P> <P> The foundation, for its part, has not been reticent about publicizing its  support of Escalante. Its promotional literature regularly includes photographs  of Escalante in his classroom or standing side-by-side with beaming foundation  executives. ROBERT W. WELKOS and JOEL SAPPELL  </P></p>

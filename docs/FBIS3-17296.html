The newspaper's opinion is that the draft budget plan is  subject to an endorsement procedure which, according to expert  estimates, may continue for several months.    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA (independent newspaper) carries an  interview with Latvian Deputy Defence Minister Dainis Turlais,  who particiates in the Russo-Latvian inter-state talks.    Turlais visualises cooperation between Latvia and Russia  only  within the framework of civilised state relations. He pointed  out as follows:    "Some people both in Russia and Latvia try to substitute  power politics for a normal relationship" or "try to play on  national feelings. One should not rake up old grievances or  look for some scheming in each other's policies.    "At this difficult time, errors are inevitable on one and  the  other side. One must realise that we -- two neighbouring states  -- can do a lot of useful things for each other."    The Latvian deputy defence minister spoke about the  development of national defence forces, military cooperation  among the three Baltic countries, and the republic's  participation in the partnership-for-peace programme.    In NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA, Konstantin Zatulin, a member of the  State Duma and chairman of the committee for CIS affairs and  relations with compatriots, recognises it necessary "now that  the country is experiencing a hard political and economic  crisis, to get agreement on politicial struggle conditions which  the main political forces would agree not to break," and, for  the sake of achieving national concord "to forget what divided  these forces in the past."    Zatulin sees a way out of the economic crisis first of all  in  changing the taxation system. The point is, without reducing  the already dramatically slashed expenditure on social needs, to  move from draconian taxes and a narrow taxation basis to sparing  taxes and, accordingly, a broad basis of their application."    "It is essential to reduce budget deficit through the  placement of securities and to hold out until funds start to  come in as a result of the expansion of the taxation basis and  the tightening of tax discipline"    In IZVESTIYA, prominent eye surgeon Svyatoslav Fedorov, who  organised a highly profitable eye microsurgery joint-stock  company, sees a way out of the current critical situation in the  Russian economy primarily in the establishment of closed-type  joint-stock companies where shares are distributed among  producers depending on seniority and salary, and with a transfer  of all means of production to the work collectives.    Fedorov also points out the need to abolish a profit tax,  freeze the export of raw materials and sell them to domestic  producers at frozen prices lower than world ones, and exempt  investments from taxes for several years until the producer  becomes independent and repays the debts.    IZVESTIYA on a "Coup Scenario No.2" anonymous message with a  false fax number:    "A `Coup Scenario No.2' Anonymous Message With a False Fax  Number of Sender is Out and Reaches High Places" is the headline  of an article by Vladimir Ivanidze, who comments on the second  anonymous message the text of which reached the OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  (COMMON NEWSPAPER) last Friday.    Ivanidze is of the opinion that "the anonymous message  writers not so much blew up the political situation in the  country as added distinctiveness to the aberration afflicting  our society".    RABOSHAYA TRIBUNA runs a statement by Petr Romanov, member  of  the federation council.    "Under conditions when the present constitutional justices  are virtually jobless and do not engage in judicial activities,  they could, impelled by civic motives, participate in the quest  for national concord in society, and advise executive and  legislative power bodies, without a reward in addition to the  state-provided salary which they receive for inaction", the  statement said.    PRAVDA on non-application of amnesty to former Security  Minister Viktor Barannikov.    The newspaper asserts that the office of the Russian  Federation prosecutor-general did not apply the amnesty to  former Security Minister Viktor Barannikov, who remains under  investigation. His defence lawyer D. Shteinberg believes that  this can hardly be explained by arguments that "the person  staying in hospital has been forgotten in the struggle which A.  Kazannik waged with the presidential entourage, seeking to  release Aleksandr Rutskoy and Ruslan Khasbulatov and their  associates as soon as possible."    The defence lawyer is convinced that Barannikov "has not  been  forgotten or pardoned." A certain role in this is played by the  fact that the former minister "knows very much about Kremlin  secrets."</p>

			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Talks on cocoa output management break down Members of the International Cocoa Organisation, who are meeting in London this week, have failed to agree on rules covering a new production management deal which was implemented in February. On Wednesday the organisation agreed a new set of output and consumption estimates to underly their discussions of the market for the next five years. However, talks broke down yesterday when consumers complained that their views were not adequately represented enough on the production committee. ICCO members have suggested opening their talks in September two days early to discuss consumer representation. Meanwhile the cocoa market appeared unmoved by the organisation's vacillations and prices at the London Commodity Exchange were more influenced by the fortunes of the coffee market. At the close of trading, the September cocoa futures price recouped earlier losses to finish unchanged at Pounds 1,003 a tonne.</p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> MAN, 74, ARRESTED IN DRUG RAID  </P> <P> Culminating a three-year investigation, local and federal authorities arrested  a 74-year-old man and two residents of his luxurious Costa Mesa home for  possession of methamphetamines, marijuana and explosives, authorities announced  this morning.  </P> <P> Arrested were homeowner Michael Patrick Marvich, 74; Tina Marie Anderson, 25,  and Collin Lee Quick, 51, Costa Mesa police said.  </P> <P> Police and U.S. Customs Service agents seized three kilograms of  methamphetamines, 30 pounds of high-grade marijuana, a bomb, blasting caps and  $23,000 in cash in a raid last Thursday, said Sgt. Tom Boylan of the Costa Mesa  Police narcotics investigation unit.  </P> <P> Boylan said it is unusual to find someone over the age of 60 involved in  alleged drug trafficking.  </P> <P> "We've had a few big-time drug dealers in their 50s," Boylan said. "But as far  as I know, this is the first one we've had that is much older than that."  Arraignment is pending for all three suspects.  </P></p>

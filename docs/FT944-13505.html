			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's Citibank still has some work to do on its scheme for allowing Lloyd's Names to convert to limited liability status. But it is the sort of arrangement that should appeal to many existing Names. Those hardened gamblers looking to get the most out of the market's recovery may want to retain their unlimited liability. This enables them to write business representing up to five times the funds lodged with Lloyd's. The Citibank scheme will offer gearing of only 2:1 though it may be possible to increase it to 3:1 through the use of a reinsurance contract. But such returns may well be attractive enough for existing Names who are no longer prepared to put their last collar stud at risk. Similar schemes are less likely to appeal to potential new investors in the market even if Lloyd's reduced the limit on new limited liability members from the current Pounds 1.5m. Though the new breed of Lloyd's corporate vehicles have not proved particularly popular with private individuals, they should offer new investors similar potential returns as under the Citibank scheme. They also have the important advantage that investors can sell all or some of their interest at any time. For Lloyd's itself, such schemes should slow the loss of capital put up by Names. But they will do nothing to curb the market's high costs. Administering the affairs of thousands of tiny companies will be just as expensive as dealing with a multitude of Names.</p>

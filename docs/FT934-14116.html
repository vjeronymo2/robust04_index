			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Redwood launches attack on 'yobs' MR JOHN REDWOOD, the Welsh secretary, last night launched a fierce attack on what he called the 'yobbish tendency'. Speaking to the Cardiff Business club, Mr Redwood, who caused a furore in July with a speech on the social problems caused by single parent families, said: 'There is in Wales and throughout Britain a revulsion against the yobbish tendency. We don't want our public buildings defaced by graffiti. We don't want the fences and roundabouts ripped out of our parks and playgrounds. We don't want young men shouting and worse on the streets at night.' He added: 'The idea that the yobs who do these things have no choice, that they are creatures of circumstances is nonsense. They are not prisoners of time and place: they should be prisoners at Her Majesty's pleasure if nothing else will stop them.' Mr Redwood drew upon a visit to a primary school for his speech. He said teachers had asked him how they could be expected to cope with discipline when parents had lost control of 10-year-olds. Ten-year-olds, he said, should not be out of control. 'Parents should know where their children and younger teenagers are after dark. If we don't deal firmly and quickly with the 10-year-olds, we will have little chance when they are 15.' Parents, neighbours and teachers had to take responsibility and the government had to give a lead which, Mr Redwood said, was what Mr Michael Howard, the home secretary, was doing.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Kanebo hit by sluggish sales KANEBO, the Japanese synthetic fibre and cosmetics manufacturer, was hurt by sluggish sales of its food and fashion goods due to the cool summer and poor textile sales, writes Emiko Terazono. The company posted a 92.4 per cent fall in unconsolidated pre-tax profits, to Y219m (Dollars 2m), for the first six months to September. Sales fell 16.2 per cent to Y219.9bn, while after-tax profits declined 97.4 per cent to Y20m. The company will forego dividend payments for the first half.</p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / British Chambers of Commerce Survey: Upturn in regions may be fragile AREAS OF weakness across the regions could cast doubt on the sustainability of the UK's apparent recovery, the British Chambers of Commerce said yesterday. Growth in domestic manufacturing in north-east England - the region leading the country out of recession with the strongest growth rate - faltered in the first quarter of this year. A similar slowdown in East Anglia, a further region where growth last year was more encouraging than elsewhere, prompted the chambers to question the sustainability of growth in some areas. 'In the cases of the north-east and East Anglia, we are looking at the inability of two regions to sustain growth, given that there is no growth in the regions around them,' said Mr Richard Brown, director of policy. In spite of the easing in the north-east, growth in the domestic market of its manufacturing sector remained the highest in the country. The fragility of the recovery was further highlighted by a slowdown of growth in the service sectors of the same regions. In the north-east service-sector growth fell back slightly while service providers in East Anglia suffered a strong fall with more companies suffering lower sales than in the fourth quarter of last year. Merseyside's economy was the weakest of all the regions. The chambers said the area's economy seemed to be 'swinging back and forward'. Impressive growth in service-sector exports in the last quarter of last year was followed by a sharp decline in exports. However, in the same quarter manufacturers began to see a recovery in export orders. Investment plans in the region fell to a 'drastically low level'. London saw a turnaround in manufacturing for the domestic and export markets at the start of the year. In the last quarter of last year more companies in London reported that sales were decreasing rather than increasing. This trend was sharply reversed in the first quarter of this year.</p>

			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Technology: An eye on the crops Satellite technology is being harnessed to help farmers plant crops, but satellites are also being employed by governments as their spy in the sky to check what producers have planted and whether they are cheating on their claims for European Union subsidies. All EU governments, except Luxembourg, are using satellite imagery to ensure that producers' claim forms for farm support match up with what is on the ground. With more than Pounds 28bn in subsidies at stake, remote sensing has become an integral part of the Common Agricultural Policy. Interpreting satellite imagery to distinguish which crops have been planted and the extent of farmers' holdings has improved rapidly over the years. Four years ago, it was used on a purely experimental basis, but this year most EU members have harnessed it as a vital tool in tracking fraud. Neil Pattie at the National Remote Sensing Centre in Farnborough, which has the contract for checking UK producers, says each crop has its own 'fingerprint' on an infra-red image. A computer interprets these 'fingerprints' to produce a map marked with different colours. Oilseed rape, for example, is pink, in contrast to its bright yellow hue in the field. 'Our job is to flag up discrepancies between the information included on farmers' claim forms and the crop on the ground,' he says. Producers will not be penalised on satellite imagery alone - the Ministry of Agriculture will send a local inspector to look at farms where anomalies appear. Pattie is not allowed to reveal how much fraud his system uncovers but cites a 'small but significant number of discrepancies'. An official from the National Farmers' Union in Brussels points out that some of the satellite images have been so good they have shown up farm management details. For example, one farmer had not applied herbicide to rape crops and the images showed the spread of poppies in the field.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with PRC Vice President Rong Yiren by Hajime </F> Takano, managing editor of INSIDER, in Beijing, date not given;  from the "Sunday Project" program -- recorded, Rong speaks in  Chinese with superimposed translation into Japanese]    [Text] [Video shows Rong Yiren sitting on a sofa in an  office] I have done only a little for China's open policy.  After China began pursuing the open policy, I met from time to  time with Mr. Deng Xiaoping at meetings of the central  government. I also had opportunities to meet with Chairman Mao  Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai and Marshal Zhu De. I met with CPC  leaders when they needed an urgent discussion with me about the  Chinese Government's policies. At the time, Mr. Deng asked us to  make full use of our experiences to contribute to pushing for  China's open up policy. In particular, Mr. Deng asked me to  work to attract foreign capitals. I immediately visited  Germany, France, Switzerland, Japan and the United States and  Australia. I briefed people there on China's reform and open up  policy and they responded to my briefing, saying the policy was  fresh and splendid.    I believe that the underlying strength, that has developed  the China International Trust and Investment Corporation [CITIC]  as it is today, is China's reform and open up policy. All  employees of the CITIC have worked hard and foreign  entrepreneurs have been convinced that there will be no change  in China's reform and open up policy. I believe that these have  contributed to the development of the CITIC.    [Hajime Takano] Mr. Vice President, I would like to ask what  role overseas Chinese have played in developing China's economy?    [Rong Yiren] I believe that the issue of overseas Chinese is  a very complicated one. Some overseas Chinese already hold dual  citizenship. I hope that they will cooperate with China's  economic development while abiding by laws of countries where  they live. If those overseas Chinese hope to carry out economic  and investment activities for China and countries where they  live, we will of course welcome their hopes.    [Takano] The creation of a grand China economic sphere has  frequently been reported by newspapers and magazines. I would  like to ask about the possibility of forging such an sphere.    [Rong] Taiwan is part of China, and Hong Kong is set to  revert to the Chinese rule in 1997. Macao, too, will revert to  Chinese rule in 1999. These regions hope to build a cooperative  relationship with China. We intend to discuss with people there  how to develop the regions and China, while cooperating with  them. We have never talked of a great China economic sphere. I  do not think that China supports such a concept.</p>

			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Can Europe Compete?: A much quieter beat to the bio rhythm - Biotechnology Compared to the entrepreneurial and scientific ferment of the US biotechnology industry, the European scene seems sedate. Europe has nothing to match America's estimated 1,300 biotech businesses - 240 of them public companies - nor the volume of hype about their research achievements, generated by a public relations machine keen to keep investors happy. But the huge gap visible between the activity in the US and Europe does not reflect such a big difference in real achievements. 'Don't be misled by the sight of a thousand biotech flowers blooming in the US,' says Mr Brian Ager, director of Senior Advisory Group Biotechnology, a European industry body. 'We don't have a full-scale industry but we have large European companies using biotechnology within their operations.' European pharmaceutical and chemical groups are plugging into US biotechnology through a network of R&amp;D alliances with independent American biotech companies. Roche of Switzerland led the way with its Dollars 2.1bn purchase of a majority stake in Genentech in 1990; the Swiss group also has minority stakes in Chiron and Protein Design Labs and collaborative agreements with Amgen, Synergen and Hybridon, among others. Glaxo of the UK is working with half a dozen US biotech companies. 'Most large European companies have embraced biotechnology, though it took years to convince some of them that biotech was not a fad,' says Prof Jurgen Drews, Roche's head of international R&amp;D. The weakness of European biotech, as Prof Drews sees it, is 'that somehow the translation of the science into entrepreneurial activity doesn't work well. This has something to do with the legislation that has stigmatised biotechnology in some European countries.' Dr Peter Doyle, research director of Zeneca, the UK bioscience company, says biotech is the area of science in which Europe has been handicapped by over-regulation. But he and other leaders of the European biotech industry are expressing more confidence that the political tide is turning. This is the fifth part of a 10-part series. Tomorrow: Environment.</p>

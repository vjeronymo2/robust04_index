			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: AT&amp;T unit plans to withdraw from chips AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions, formerly NCR, plans to withdraw from the semiconductor market and is seeking a buyer for its NCR microelectronic products division. While the company would not estimate a market value for the operations, it said it was prepared to negotiate aggressively with suitable potential buyers for a speedy transaction. Its decision to sell the semiconductor operations followed a business portfolio analysis. 'It no longer fits strategically with our business plan,' a spokesman said. NCR was acquired by AT&amp;T in 1991 and renamed AT&amp;T Global Information Solutions this year. The NCR semiconductor operation has continued to operate independently rather than being integrated with AT&amp;T's existing semiconductor operations. AT&amp;T's microelectronic division, which had estimated 1993 sales of more than Dollars 1bn, is not affected by the sale, the company said. With sales last year of Dollars 372m, the NCR division employs almost 2,000 people at two semiconductor plants in Colorado as well as a plant in Wichita, Kansas, making personal computer circuit boards, and Utrecht, in the Netherlands, where there is a wireless data communications product line. The division is profitable and its sales have been growing at about 25 per cent per year, the company said. Morgan Stanley has been retained to find a buyer.</p>

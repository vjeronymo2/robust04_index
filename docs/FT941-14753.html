			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Pay freezes may affect 2m Nearly 2m employees may be covered by pay freezes, the Confederation of British Industry says. The CBI's latest Employment Affairs Report says its pay databank suggests that a quarter of manufacturers and a sixth of service companies are operating pay freezes. The organisation also stresses that there is little sign of 'catching-up' awards when freezes end. Settlements after a pay standstill, at 2.1 per cent in the private sector, compare with an average of 3.4 per cent for all settlements last year. The CBI cites several cases - including a distributor and retailer in the south-east with a turnover of Pounds 100m and 1,200 employees. The distributor had to cut costs as trade dwindled, and introduced a 12-month wage freeze. The CBI said: 'The freeze was followed by a 1.5 per cent award but there was no element of catch-up.' Job vacancies at executive level rose sharply in the fourth quarter of last year, according to the latest jobs survey by MSL, the recruitment consultants. Recruitment for high-technology jobs was up by 142 per cent compared with the fourth quarter of 1992, while there was growth of 156 per cent in retailing management jobs.</p>

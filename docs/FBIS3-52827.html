In a statement to the MENA correspondent in Khartoum,  al-Bashir said: Our Arab ties are inclined toward  reconciliation with those who are hostile to us because we  believe that reconciliation among the Arabs is the peoples'  desire. We will continue our efforts to achieve this goal in  the near future, if not today.    He added: Everyone in the Arab region now feels that the  current discord has weakened the Arab stance on the Arab  nation's causes. We have noticed that the Arabs are absent in  many international arenas and in the situations that require  cooperation and coordination.    For his part, Sudanese Foreign Minister Husayn Abu-Salih has  said that his country supports all efforts to achieve Arab  reconciliation and all initiatives to restore Arab solidarity.    In a statement to the MENA Khartoum correspondent, he added:  We have already declared our support for the initiatives of  United Arab Emirates President Shaykh Zayid Bin-Sultan Al  Nuhayyan, Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id of Oman, and Arab League  Secretary General Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid.    He noted that the current regional and world challenges make  Sudan more insistent on collective and bilateral action to  achieve Arab reconciliation. This reconciliation, he said, has  become a historic responsibility that requires everyone to  accomplish it in line with the aspirations of the Arab nations  who are fed up with the current divisions.    Abu-Salih says: Arab reconciliation and the restoration of  Arab unity are the goals we are trying to accomplish, and this  proves our sincere desire to improve the current situation. We  are doing all we can to achieve reconciliation, and we will be  the first to support an Arab summit to achieve solidarity and  rally all efforts to confront the current world and regional  dangers that threaten the Arab nations.    He asserted the need for a suitable atmosphere to achieve an  inter-Arab political detente and to prepare properly for an Arab  summit. He remarked that the bases on which such reconciliation  relies are stipulated in the Arab League charter, which we all  respect.    Dr. Mustafa 'Uthman Isma'il, Sudanese minister of state and  secretary of the popular international friendship council [name  and title as received], says achieving Arab reconciliation is  one of the fundamental bases of Sudan's foreign policy. This  policy's aim, he adds, is to eliminate all causes of division  and dispute because Arab solidarity will stop the current  disorder.    He believes that the current developments in the Arab world,  Israel's attempts at hegemony and expansion, the deadlock in the  Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, and pan-Arab security problems  such as the water and border problems require an urgent Arab  summit. He said that to be successful this summit needs  favorable circumstances by removing current tensions and  disputes. He expressed his belief that if the current intense  reconciliation efforts are boosted, they will pave the way for a  summit.    The Sudanese minister of state believes that the Arab League  should move in various ways to make the Gulf Cooperation Council  issue a resolution calling for such a summit. He notes that the  Arab League can also seek other resolutions from the Arab  Maghreb Union and from countries outside these two councils.  Then the Arab League should meet at the foreign ministers level  to discuss proposals and means for the summit.    He says that reconciliations between countries with various  disputes could be achieved before the summit, which would  consolidate these efforts, and other topics could be discussed.    He affirmed that the summit is necessary and desirable even  if it achieves nothing because it will break the psychological  barrier caused by the Gulf war and because failing to hold such  a summit will encourage others to interfere in Arab affairs and  will weaken Arab efforts to restore solidarity.    The Sudanese minister of state pointed out that the general  Arab trend is positive and inclined toward reconciliation. He  noted that past reconciliation efforts have resulted in easing  tension, as was the case in Palestinian-Saudi relations when  Faysal al-Husayni in his capacity as head of the Palestinian  Steering Committee in the peace talks visited Riyadh; the start  of a dialogue between Yemen and Saudi Arabia; and the  improvement of Sudan's relations with some of the Gulf states,  including Qatar and Oman. He said: I believe that the efforts  of the Arab League and its secretary general will help end the  current differences, although these efforts might take some time  to reach a strategic situation where the Arab countries will  form a single economic, military, and social bloc.    He added that Egypt's role is crucial in holding the summit,  because as chairman of the Arab League and the OAU and with its  influence it can help expedite the efforts to hold an Arab  summit.    For his part, Muhammad Shakir al-Siraj, chairman of the  Foreign Relations Committee of the Sudanese Transitional  National Council, the parliament, asserts that restoration of  Arab solidarity is a fundamental requirement to ward off the  dangers that threaten the Arab world and the suffering of the  Iraqi, Libyan, and Sudanese peoples.    Al-Siraj expressed his belief that Arab leaders are able to  restore solidarity and that after more than three years since  the outbreak of the Gulf war, disputes that resulted from that  war should disappear. He hopes the Arab leaders will be able to  hold a summit this year.</p>

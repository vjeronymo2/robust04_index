			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Single bidder for Petrogal A CONSORTIUM comprising Total of France and leading Portuguese companies, including the Espirito Santo group, has emerged as the only bidder for Petrogal, the state-owned oil group valued at Es131bn (Dollars 916m), writes Patrick Blum in Lisbon. The timetable for offers closed on March 17, and a jury will now have to consider the consortium's bid for an initial 25 per cent of the company. The starting price for bids was Es1,700 per share. If the consortium's offer is acceptable, the government is expected to approve the sale soon. Another consortium, led by DuPont of the US, dropped out of the bidding. Under conditions set out for Petrogal's privatisation programme, the consortium will have to buy another 26 per cent stake in the company within nine months, at the same price per share paid for the initial 25 per cent. This will bring the consortium's holding to 51 per cent.</p>

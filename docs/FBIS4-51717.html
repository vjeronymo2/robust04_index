			<p>BFN     [Text] According to the Public Relations Department  correspondent, Phuket Governor Suchit Nimitkun gave a news  conference about the bombing yesterday at 2130 in a bathroom at  the Karon Royal Wing Hotel, Tambon Karon, Phuket Province. The  incident took place during a party of nationwide Singha Beer  distributors and their families totaling about 800 people.    The governor and the officials concerned inspected the site  of the incident. The governor said initial police inspection  revealed that the explosive was C-4 and was aimed only at  generating noise to frighten the party participants. Two people  were slightly injured in the legs. The party continued after  the incident. It was learned that the party organizers might  have known in advance about a possible disruption plan and had  asked for police protection.    The governor said the incident is not likely to be  politically motivated. Property and lives were not targetted,  and it was merely an attempt to intimidate the party goers.  However, the overall image of Phuket could be affected since  the province will host several international conferences -- the  ASEAN police chiefs conference during 1-5 May and the municipal  league conference during 9-13 May. In any event, the provincial  administration has taken precautionary measures for these  events. The people need not worry.</p>

			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / People: Thames Water After a year-long search, Thames Water has appointed a managing director for its international contracting and consulting arm. Tony Eckford, a qualified engineer and deputy chairman and chief operating officer of the process and energy division of construction group Amec, will take over from next month. Eckford will be expected to continue the process begun by Thames's chief executive, Mike Hoffman, of bringing together the company's non-regulated international businesses into one division. Thames, like other water companies, has been pursuing international contracts to operate waste and water plants as a way of building non-regulated income. The company is particularly keen to strengthen its presence in the Far East, South America and, eventually, eastern Europe. There, the pace of economic activity is creating increased demand for water and waste services. Thames found the search for an international managing director difficult. It has been forced to pay a generous remuneration package, including performance-related bonuses and share options. Eckford will be on a rolling contract of at least two years.</p>

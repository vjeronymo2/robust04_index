			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Spotlight" report by Jean de Toulkork: "Shake-up stirs </F> bitterness in FUNCINPEC"]    [Text] Phnom Penh -- Morale is low in the FUNCINPEC  [National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia] party of First Prime Minister Prince  Norodom Ranariddh following a high-level shake-up involving  Foreign Minister Prince Norodom Sirivut.    According to a senior Cambodian Minister, who spoke on  condition of anonymity, Ranariddh has fired Sirivut from the  post of FUNCINPEC secretary-general and given him the less  influential post of vice president to the party.    Loy Simchheang, the third vice president of the National  Assembly, has been appointed to replace Sirivut as party  secretary general.    Ranariddh, the minister said, has been unhappy with  Sirivut's  siding with Finance Minister Sam Rangsi who has taken a strong  stand against the activities in Cambodia of the Thai Bun Rong  company.    Sirivut, who is King Norodom Sihanouk's stepbrother, has  been  a keen supporter of Rangsi's economic polices and financial  management of Cambodia's troubled economy. Both Rangsi and  Sirivut have received the blessing of King Sihanouk in their  endeavours and in recent weeks the two ministers have met often  at Sirivut's office in the foreign ministry.    On April 16, while celebrations of the Cambodian New Year  were in full swing, Ranariddh summoned Sirivut to his home and  told him that he was no longer the secretary general of the  party, a post to which he had been appointed only early in the  year.    Ranariddh's move angered Sirivut who expected better  treatment from the first prime minister. The following day,  Sirivut was conspicuously absent from a ceremony at the Royal  Palace during which ministers paid their respects to the king  and queen on the occasion of Chol Chhnam Thmei (traditional  Cambodian New Year).    Sirivut, the minister said, was considering his position in  the government as he had been shocked by Ranariddh's unilateral  action, which was not submitted to the consideration of the  higher ranks of the party.    Sirivut has been a loyal lieutenant of Ranariddh's, even  siding with him against the notorious Prince Norodom  Chakkrapong, Ranariddh's step-brother and fierce opponent. Now  Sirivut feels that his loyalty and support for Ranariddh has not  been reciprocated by the first prime minister.    In January this year, when Ranariddh was under strong  pressure from the Cambodian People's Party to fire the finance  minister, it was Sirivut's threat to resign as deputy prime  minister and foreign minister which saved Rangsi.    Sirivut and Rangsi have strong views about relations with  Thailand and about the need to clean up the business environment  established by Thai merchants in Phnom Penh. In their view,  they have received strong support from colleagues in FUNCINPEC  and the population of Cambodia, especially from those small  traders affected by the long-running conflict with the Thai Bun  Rong company over the Olympic market affair.    King Sihanouk, who strongly supports the foreign affairs and  finance policies of the two ministers, has gone out of his way  to make public his blessing.    In January, when Rangsi was in danger of being dismissed,  the  King wrote a letter congratulating him and his staff for their  good work. In the same month, he elevated Sirivut to the rank  of Sdech Kromkhun, making him among the most senior princes of  the Royal Cambodian Family.    Significantly, under the same Kret (Royal Decree), the King  elevated to the same rank two of his sons -- Prince Norodom  Sihakmoni, and Prince Norodom Chakkrapong. Both of these would  side with Sirivut against Ranariddh in any confrontation among  Royal Family members, observers say.    Royal Palace sources declined to reveal the King's reaction  to the removal of Sirivut from the influential party post. But  one source said the king was "deeply concerned" by some recent  actions.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CRUISE CONTROL;  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE TRIES TO DRIVE YOUTHS OUT OF TOWN  </P> <P> When Hawthorne Police Sgt. Robert Cooper first heard that cruisers were once  again gathering along Hawthorne Boulevard, he was decidedly reluctant to crack  down on their fun.  </P> <P> As a teen-ager, he used to cruise with the best of them along the same street  made famous by the Beach Boys -- to see the hot rods, to race cars and to pick  up girls. Remembering the old A &amp; W root beer stand, where cruisers once  gathered, and the Wichstand, a drive-in restaurant where his friends later  would meet, the veteran police officer felt nostalgic.  </P> <P> After a gang-related shooting in Lawndale during cruising hours last month, he  decided that the innocent amusement of his youth had become too dangerous to go  unchecked. Cooper, a supervisor in the traffic division, now sends extra patrol  officers to Hawthorne Boulevard on cruising nights in an attempt to drive the  cruisers out of town.  </P> <P> "The people coming around, probably 90% of them are just regular ol' kids not  really out to do much of anything," Cooper said. "But the city just can't let  it go on and let all those folks who like to shoot up the town come in and have  target practice. We're kind of in the situation that if we don't go out and  discourage them, violence will escalate."  </P> <P> Hawthorne's cruising revival began about two months ago when several hundred  cruisers from as far away as Whittier and the San Fernando Valley suddenly  rediscovered Hawthorne Boulevard. Many of them came in response to a crackdown  in Redondo Beach, where police have been enforcing ordinances against loud  music.  </P> <P> Troy Staehler, 18, of Torrance said he and other members of the Rollerz Only  car and truck club deserve credit for the revival. Two months ago, Rollerz Only  members handed out about 10,000 flyers that named Hawthorne Boulevard as the  new cruising hot spot on Tuesday nights, Staehler said.  </P> <P> "We got the idea from our parents because they said they used to cruise  Hawthorne back in the '60s when they had their little race cars," Staehler  said.  </P> <P> The cruisers usually meet about 8 p.m. at the Burger King on Hawthorne  Boulevard at Rosecrans Avenue before driving to Carl's Jr. or 7-Eleven. They  rarely race, but almost always blare rap music from their cars, Staehler said.  </P> <P> At first, police said, the cruising appeared harmless. Although the extra cars  caused some gridlock problems, "We thought, what the heck, the kids have to  have something to do and some place to go so we're not going to lose sleep over  it," Cooper said.  </P> <P> Within a few weeks the complaints became more serious, and it became clear that  gang members were also showing up for the festivities.  </P> <P> Tensions erupted last month when a suspected gang member was shot during a  brawl in the parking lot of a restaurant on Hawthorne Boulevard. The victim is  recovering from his wounds. Prosecutors have decided that his attacker was  acting in self-defense and will not press charges, Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Sgt. Michael Kwan said.  </P> <P> To prevent clashes between gang members and cruisers, and to ensure that no  bystanders are caught in the cross-fire, police and gang counselors have  started to discourage cruisers from coming into the city.  </P> <P> In the last few weeks, police have been enforcing traffic laws and issuing  citations to cruisers whose cars are too low. Cars cited more than once for  unsafe driving conditions have been towed away, Cooper said.  </P> <P> Despite the potential dangers, Staehler said members of his club are determined  to keep cruising, and they plan to distribute more flyers. Law enforcement  officials said they hate to put a damper on the cruisers' fun but the hazards  of gang activity leave them with no choice.  </P> <P> "It's just not good, clean fun anymore," Cooper said. "While most of the people  view it that way, we have enough of the undesirable element that thinks, 'Hey,  let's go shoot 'em up.' Unfortunately, everyone is going to have to suffer  because we don't need a bunch of dead kids in our city."  </P></p>

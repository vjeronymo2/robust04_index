			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 20-VOLUME ENGLISH SET COSTS $2,500;  </P> <P> NEW OXFORD DICTIONARY -- IMPROVING ON THE ULTIMATE  </P> <P> The uninitiated may understandably wonder what all the fuss is about.  </P> <P> Here's novelist Anthony Burgess calling it "the greatest publishing event of  the century." It is to be marked by a half-day seminar and lunch at that bluest  of blue-blood London hostelries, Claridge's. The guest list of 250 dignitaries  is a literary "Who's Who."  </P> <P> All this is to mark the publication next Thursday of the second edition of the  Oxford English Dictionary -- the OED2 to the cogniscenti -- 61 years after the  first edition.  </P> <P> Claridge's for a dictionary? With this kind of build-up you might have expected  at least some newly discovered work of Shakespeare. But then, the Oxford  English Dictionary is to most other dictionaries what Shakespeare is to a comic  book, or Stradivarius to a fiddle.  </P> <P> Admirers say the 20-volume second edition should not even be mentioned in the  same breath with the single-volume compendium of words that most of us keep on  our bookshelves for help in writing term papers or cheating on crossword  puzzles. It's like comparing a communications satellite with a walkie-talkie.  </P> <P> This dictionary costs $2,500. It represents more than a century of awesome  scholarship and has been dubbed no less than "the leading repository for the  English language." But you can also read it for fun.  </P> <P> The Independent newspaper's Sunday magazine called it "this monumental,  indispensable, and slightly eccentric work."  </P> <P> What makes the Oxford dictionary so special -- and so long -- are the nearly  2.5 million quotations it uses to illustrate the evolution in meaning and  context of each word, from its earliest recorded usage to an appropriate modern  example.  </P> <P> Like its less ambitious kin, the dictionary has a pronunciation guide,  etymology, and definitions for each word, too. But the quotations put it in a  different league by telling the story of a language.  </P> <P> They reveal, for example, that in the 13th Century the word nice meant  "ignorant." It took hundreds of years for it to take on its modern meaning of  "pleasant," passing en route through "foolish," "over-scrupulous," and  "precise."  </P> <P> The dictionary's co-editor, Edmund Weiner described his role as more a  historian of language than an arbiter of usage. He doesn't usually get upset  when he hears someone misuse a word, Weiner said in an interview. He gets  curious, wondering whether it is just part of the mysterious process by which a  language grows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Words as Actually Used  </P> <P> The dictionary doesn't judge, either. It records the way words are actually  used, even if grammarians and scholars disapprove. It also records their  disapproval.  </P> <P> The word fulsome, for example, used to mean "insincere." But because of  confusion with the word "full," now it is often used when the speaker means  "ample" or "generous." Thus, the "fulsome apology" once deemed hypocritical may  now be acceptable, and that reality is duly noted in the dictionary.  </P> <P> One of the 5,000 new words and meanings in the second edition is bad, which  means "excellent" in modern American slang.  </P> <P> Other new entries range from "AMEX" and "artsy-fartsy" to "palimony" and  "yuppification." Medicine contributes "acupressure," "biofeedback,"  "brain-dead" and "passive smoking," while commerce offers "greenmail," "fast  track" and "plastic money."  </P> <P> Oxford University Press, publisher of both editions of the dictionary, claims  that the English language grows by at least 450 words a year. Weiner believes  that is a gross underestimate. Either way, it explains why the publisher has  been running a losing race with words ever since 1879 when it first signed a  contract with Britain's Philological Society to produce an authoritative  dictionary.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Self-Taught Lexicographer  </P> <P> James A. H. Murray, a Scottish grammar school teacher and self-taught  lexicographer, became the Oxford dictionary's first editor with the idea of  producing a four-volume dictionary in 10 years. By the time he died 36 years  later, in 1915, Murray had carried his project into the T's. His successors  finally finished the 12-volume first edition in 1928, and as staggering an  enterprise as it was, it was already far enough out of date that it needed a  supplement.  </P> <P> A one-volume supplement in 1933 was followed between 1972 and 1986 by four  more. But well before the last supplement had appeared, Weiner, co-editor John  Simpson, and their colleagues were hard at work on the completely new edition  that debuts March 30.  </P> <P> The new edition includes all the material from the original and the  supplements, plus the new words and meanings. The additions, said Weiner,  reflect the way in which the language is growing.  </P> <P> There has been an "explosion" in words that were once proprietary, but which  have now become "not just proper names, but also items of general culture,"  said Weiner. There were only a dozen or so in the first edition, he noted --  words like "Vaseline," "Thermos" and "Hoover." Among the scores of new such  entries in the second edition are "Diner's Club," "Visa" and "Fortune 500."  They are the modern equivalent, Weiner said, of the way that the names of  geographical locations were once applied to generic carpets, wines, and other  artifacts.  </P> <P> "Rambo" rates more words in OED2 than he has spoken in some of his films.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growth of Acronyms  </P> <P> Acronyms are another growth category -- "probably one of the most important  changes in word formation in the 20th Century," according to Weiner. Debuting  in the second edition, for example, are "AIDS" (acquired immune deficiency  syndrome), "AMEX" (American Express), "PIN" (personal identification number),  and "START" (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks).  </P> <P> One of Weiner's regrets about the new edition is its failure to include another  acronym -- "DINK" (dual income, no kids). When the editors were compiling the  "D" section of the dictionary a couple of years ago, he said, there wasn't  enough evidence that the term would catch on. "It looked like it might be  ephemeral." So it was left out. Now, said Weiner, he's convinced DINK is "a  word of the '80s."  </P> <P> The first edition, some say, was really a dictionary of British English. But to  whatever extent that may have been true, it's much less so in the second  edition. Weiner estimated that at least half the new words and meanings in the  second edition originated in North America.  </P> <P> "The English language is now really a big federation," the 38-year-old  co-editor commented. And because it has the largest single concentration of  native English speakers, North America is where there is the most dynamic  change in the language. It may be an extraordinary view for an Englishman,  Weiner acknowledged, but "we can't be Brito-centric and turn our back on the  rest of the world."  </P> <P> Still, the dictionary's original editor, Murray, would probably be less  surprised by the changes in his dictionary than by the changes in the way it is  produced. Thanks to computer technology and international cooperation, the new  edition required only five years to complete -- about one-tenth the time of its  predecessor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Printed in Maine  </P> <P> The new edition was printed by Rand McNally in Maine, and computerized in  Florida and Oxford using some remarkable software developed at the University  of Waterloo, in Ontario, Canada.  </P> <P> Now that the Oxford dictionary is computerized, said Weiner, it will be easier  to keep pace with the changing English language. The dictionary will be updated  continually, and perhaps more important, an electronic version is expected to  be available commercially within two years, opening up an extraordinary range  of research and cross-referencing possibilities.  </P> <P> Want to know how many times a particular source is cited? The Waterloo software  is able to scan all 59 million words in the new edition and give the answer. It  was able to determine in seconds that the Los Angeles Times is cited as the  source of a quotation 71 times in the new edition.  </P> <P> The electronic version also includes a "reverse dictionary capability" -- it  can locate a word if the user feeds in key elements of the definition.  </P> <P> That means the second edition of the Oxford English Dictionary may be the  answer to the perennial dilemma of the poor speller: How can you check a  spelling if you don't know how the word's spelled to begin with?  </P> <P> Maybe Burgess is right. More Champagne anyone?  </P></p>

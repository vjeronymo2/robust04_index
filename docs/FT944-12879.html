			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Sir Leon - too powerful, too clever - cut down to size: FT writers examine the line-up at the European Commission after the struggle to divide up portfolios Shortly after Mr Jacques Santer was appointed president of the European Commission, a senior Brussels diplomat delivered a friendly warning to Sir Leon Brittan. 'Of all the Commissioners, you have the most to lose under Mr Santer.' Sir Leon was taken aback. One of the stars of the outgoing Delors Commission, he found it hard to believe that Mr Santer would not wish to make the most of his talents. The diplomat agreed, but pointed out that Sir Leon risked being seen as too clever - and too powerful - for his own good in the incoming Santer Commission. On Saturday afternoon, the warning came true. Sir Leon, chief EU trade negotiator, found himself stripped of the plum portfolio of central and eastern Europe, and pondering resignation. It is a stunning turnaround for a politician who was acclaimed a year ago as one of the architects of the Gatt Uruguay Round agreement and who had contemplated a bid to become Commission president. Sir Leon's fall from grace may be viewed as an inevitable come-uppance for someone who has never been a team player in Brussels. His caustic comments, razor-sharp intellect, and appetite for work have prompted jealousy as much as admiration among colleagues (with the exception of Mr Jacques Delors with whom he has much in common). Sir Leon also misplayed his cards during negotiations over his new portfolio with Mr Santer. Colleagues such as Mr Manuel Marin, the senior Spanish commissioner, and Mr Padraig Flynn, Irish Commissioner, curried favour by offering to surrender portions of their fiefdoms; but Sir Leon offered too little, too late. He also underestimated the Santer team's determination to end the division between economic and political affairs in the new Commission. Thus, Sir Leon's opening offer was to give up the Northern Mediterranean, Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, and economic relations with former Yugoslavia; then he upped it to all of Asia, excluding Japan. On Saturday afternoon, he proposed giving up everything, including the powerful trade instruments, if he could keep relations with central Europe and the former Soviet Union. Colleagues concede the gesture made little sense because it undermined Sir Leon's chief argument: that the eastern European dossier largely turned on economics and trade rather than politics and security, the speciality of Mr Hans Van den Broek, the Dutch commissioner who eventually won the day. Yet Sir Leon was also the victim of events beyond his control. The decision to reward Mr Van den Broek was driven by the need to compensate the Netherlands after France and Germany snubbed Mr Ruud Lubbers, the outgoing Dutch prime minister, in his bid to succeed Mr Delors as Commission president. Neither German commissioner supported Sir Leon on Saturday afternoon - a surprise since the Bonn government continues to admire his contribution to integrating central and eastern Europe into the EU. Was it just an accident that Mr Wim Kok, Dutch prime minister, had paid a visit to Chancellor Helmut Kohl just days before the Luxembourg meeting? Sir Leon also appears to have suffered from lingering resentment over the British veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister who was the Franco-German candidate to succeed Mr Delors, at last June's European summit in Corfu. The veto won Mr John Major, British prime minister, a reprieve within his ruling Conservative party. It also propelled a reluctant Mr Santer into the top Commission post. However, it left Mr Major little leverage when it came to pleading Sir Leon's case with European allies - and Mr Santer. 'Corfu was not without cost,' said a colleague of Sir Leon.</p>

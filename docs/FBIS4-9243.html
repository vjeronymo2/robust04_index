			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tanya Tsekova] </F>   [Text] Sofia, April 20 (BTA) -- "It was time to come here  to discuss the possibility of cooperation within the European  Union as well as bilateral cooperation; the Netherlands and  Bulgaria are at the two sides of Europe, but actually we think  it very important to make Europe one whole," Dutch Prime  Minister Ruud Lubbers said arriving on an official visit to  Bulgaria today. He is accompanied by Dutch Foreign Minister  Pieter Kooijmans.    The formal talks between the Dutch delegation and Deputy  Prime Minister Evgeni Matinchev, now acting prime minister,  lasted more than two hours. Bulgarian Foreign Minister  Stanislav Daskalov also attended the talks. "It is the sides'  shared opinion that there are still untapped possibilities in  the field of economic relations which should be further  developed based on the good relations the two countries  maintain," the spokesman for the Bulgarian Government reported  after the meeting.    Deputy Prime Minister Matinchev believes that it is possible  to activate bilateral economic relations mainly in the field of  investment, production, finance and lending. He thanked the  Dutch side for its assistance in the stabilization of Bulgaria's  balance of payments. Bulgaria expressed its readiness to accept  Dutch investments in the construction of a transport corridor  from the Black Sea to Bulgaria's western border, a transport  corridor connecting the south and the north by building a tunnel  under the Shipka Pass (in the Balkan Range), and the  construction of a new bridge across the Danube. "The Bulgarian  side hopes that the Netherlands will continue to support  Bulgaria's efforts for integration with all the European  structures and will ratify its Interim Agreement on Trade with  the European Union at an early date," Deputy Prime Minister  Matinchev was cited as saying.    The prime minister of the Netherlands described  Bulgarian-Dutch cooperation within the framework of the  International Monetary Fund as very successful and praised  Bulgaria's joining the Partnership for Peace plan. Mr. Lubbers  admitted there are many potentials for the advancement of  bilateral relations, pointing out the need of updating all older  bilateral agreements and creating a modern legal framework for  the encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments. He  showed interest in the political and economic situation in  Bulgaria at the moment, the problems of ethnic minorities in  Bulgaria and human rights, Bulgaria's position on the conflict  in ex-Yugoslavia, the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and  Balkan relations.    In Mr. Matinchev's opinion, the ongoing process of  Bulgaria's  settling its debts to the Paris Club of official creditors and  the London Club of creditor banks is a light at the end of the  tunnel. Mr. Matinchev sees the lack of an earlier settlement of  Bulgaria's external debt problem and the Yugo-embargo as the  main reasons for the slow progress of reforms in this country.  According to calculations made by employing the methods of the  world body, Bulgaria has suffered a loss of 3,200 million U.S.  dollars as a result of the strict application of sanctions  against the former Yugoslavia. The direct losses in the  country's balance of payments since the beginning of this year  only are estimated at 700-900 million U.S. dollars. Mr.  Matinchev informed Mr. Lubbers about the political life in  Bulgaria, stressing that despite the heated debates in  parliament, the country is an island of peace free of  interethnic or other conflicts.    Bulgarian Foreign Minister Stanislav Daskalov made a  detailed  analysis of Bulgaria's position on the Yugo-crisis and outlined  the parameters of its Balkan policy and its relations with  Greece, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM] and Turkey.    After the formal talks the foreign ministers of Bulgaria and  the Netherlands signed a joint political declaration between the  Ministries of Foreign Affairs of the two countries. "This is  the first declaration signed by representatives of the two  countries since the collapse of communism in Bulgaria," the  media were told by Dutch Foreign Minister Pieter Kooijmans.  "The document spells out everything that Bulgaria and the  Netherlands have in common, the two countries are members of  many international organizations and have many common goals,"  Mr. Kooijmans said. Listing those common goals, he stressed the  stability and economic prosperity of Europe and cooperation in a  lot of fields. "Most important is the prevention of conflicts,  and stability also means security, the European countries should  cross-cooperate in the military organization, it is very  important to make the idea for peace a reality," the Dutch  foreign minister said.    "The joint political declaration makes provisions for  bilateral cooperation in economy, politics, trade and culture in  the light of the two countries' common goals," Bulgarian foreign  minister Daskalov specified.    Tomorrow the Dutch delegation will have meetings with  President Zhelyu Zhelev and National Assembly Chairman  Aleksandur Yordanov.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sergey Bogdanov, head of the Moscow </F> administration of the Federal Counterintelligence Service, by  Maksim Polinin; place and date not given: "Democracy Needs  Political Surveillance"]    [Text] Although corresponding presidential edicts,  the Constitution, the Criminal Code, and other normative acts  regulating operations of Russian special services do exist, the  Federal Counterintelligence Service [FCS] is in dire need of a  more concrete legislative base. This is the opinion of Sergey  Bogdanov, chief of the FCS' Moscow administration. He says that  the ideal solution would be for the president to come forward  with a legislative initiative. Especially keeping in mind that  the situation is this: Democracy needs political  surveillance.    [Polinin] Sergey Petrovich, frankly, the words "political  surveillance" bring to mind illegal persecution of  differently-minded individuals, returning us to the unpleasant  times of unmasking internal enemies and dissidents.    [Bogdanov] This is precisely the reaction I expected.  Political surveillance, they say, is a return to 1937. All  right, I have a proposal: Let us come back to this notorious  issue, but a little later.    [Polinin] Agreed. Then let me express hope that after  numerous reshufflings and renamings, the FCS is finally left  alone and given the opportunity to fulfill the functions it is  tasked with, the main one of which is combating political  terrorism.    [Bogdanov] Correct. In this respect, I want to give you an  atypical example of FCS work which, however, highlights a score  of sore problems for us. Everybody remembers the sensational  Rostov affair involving an attempt to hijack a helicopter at the  very end of last year. The reverberations were tremendous: All  of society's attention was focused on this arrogant crime; the  government was in consultations round the clock. In this case  there was a whole bouquet of law violations: armed seizure of an  air transport vessel; illegally depriving citizens of their  freedom and using them as hostages; extortion in especially  great amounts. Still, this cannot be classified as a purely  terrorist act.    [Polinin] Many people had the impression that it is not that  difficult to commit this sort of a crime, and that our  enforcement structures sometimes look helpless.    [Bogdanov] This is a wrong impression. Although... Let me  compare the current situation with the times of the KGB and MB  [Ministry of Security], when as soon as signaled that an  aircraft had been hijacked, Plan Nabat instantly went into  effect over the entire territory of the country. This is a  precisely laid-out scheme where everybody knew what they were  supposed to do: the KGB, its local spetznaz units,  transportation militia, and Aeroflot. Training maneuvers were  conducted annually under this system with the participation of  the Alpha team. There had been practically no failures. For  instance, in 1975-1985 the KGB averted about 100 aircraft  hijacking attempts, including 25 at the stage of hatching the  plan and about 15 instances at the stage of carrying out the  crime. Over these 10 years only five aircraft hijackings were  actually accomplished, and those also were foiled.    [Polinin] Are you trying to say that in the Rostov case  Nabat  failed?    [Bogdanov] In principle, Nabat still exists; however, we  have  to admit that this system has faltered in Russia. It so happened  that just before the hijacking the president's 21 December edict  came out, liquidating the MB, and this caused a certain chaos  and confusion among personnel. Operation Nabat had always been  spearheaded by the chief of an oblast administration--in the  past of the KGB, then later of the MB. He was the main actor, a  single control center. But with the MB abolished, who was to be  in charge of the operation? So, complete outsiders got involved.  As a result, the head of oblast administration was directing all  operations. All of this resembled a situation where the "top  brass" handles the job instead of leaving it to the  professionals. I will reveal a minor secret: The hijackers  should be given credit in that their criminal plan was  brilliantly thought-through and very well executed. That the  criminals have been detained, the hostages released, and  practically all the money returned we should thank... weather  conditions.    [Polinin] Still, how can we avoid such flops in the future  or  at least get out of it with minimal losses?    [Bogdanov] This is where we are coming to the issue of  political surveillance. The task of a special service such as  the FCS is first and foremost to avert a crime while it is still  in the stage of conception. Roughly put, as soon as a thought  occurs to a person--Should I perhaps hijack a plane?--here it  is: "Knock, knock, we are your friends"; our agent shows up, and  we already know everything. I want to emphasize that for people  who conceived such plans or even went into preparations for  hijacking, there have been no criminal law or administrative  consequences. That is, they were not arrested, detained, or even  summoned for an official warning. Everything was done through  the existing agents, or new agents were recruited among those  close to perpetrators, and appropriate pressure was brought on  them.    [Polinin] How?    [Bogdanov] Very simply. An agent bought a case of vodka and  drunk with a potential hijacker until the latter lost any desire  to hijack anything. All right, this is a joke; seriously--the  person was persuaded to give up his criminal plans. Naturally,  for some time he continued to remain under our covert control.  As a result, a person often never even guessed that the FCS had  played some role in his fate.    [Polinin] As I understand it, special services do not need  muscle units of the Alpha and Vympel kind, is this not so?    [Bogdanov] The FCS system needs to have its own,  sufficiently  formidable in a professional sense, antiterrorist groups. It may  be only a few units, but they must be properly trained,  equipped, and given a clearly defined number of tasks and the  area of application. World practice shows that special units are  part of special services: in Austria it is Cobra; in the United  States, Delta; in Germany, GS-9. And they are directly  subordinated to heads of special services. However,  counterintelligence work is not directly related to these units.  Combat operations are not part of "pure" counterintelligence. We  have never chased shotgun-armed bandits. At the same time, life  makes its own corrections, forcing us to acquire armed assault  teams. Therefore, I am convinced that the FCS, which has now  been stripped of its muscle structure, will in time have a  special unit.    [Polinin] Sergey Petrovich, I think now is a good time to  talk about political surveillance.    [Bogdanov] I am willing to put all the dots over the "i's."  Political surveillance is not combating legal parties,  movements, or differently-minded individuals who are in  opposition to the existing regime (president, government,  parliament). As the president's edict says, political  surveillance assumes undermining illegal armed formations, as  well as political organizations which covertly pursue the goal  of changing the existing system by armed or violent means. The  same goes for parties, movements, and individuals who covertly  incite interethnic and interconfessional strife or harbor  separatist intentions. We are charged with these tasks directly  by the Russian Constitution, and nobody argues with it. In this  sense political surveillance appears simply as an instrument of  FCS operations, which has a complete right to use its special  capabilities, including agents, confidential liaisons, and  special equipment against organizations and persons who fall  within the definitions enumerated above. Thus, the quintessence  of special service's work, which applied to a full extent to the  FCS, is to prevent and foil any criminal action that represents  a threat to state security, before it is committed, with the  help of specific means and methods.</p>

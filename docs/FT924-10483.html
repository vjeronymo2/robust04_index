			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / US prosecutor set to oppose dropping of Clifford charges MR ROBERT Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney who has led US investigations of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) affair, is expected to tell a New York court this morning that he is opposed to dismissing criminal charges against Mr Clark Clifford. The 85-year-old former US defence secretary - who resigned last year as chairman of First American Bankshares, the Washington bank that was secretly controlled by BCCI - was indicted in New York last July on charges of having taken bribes, conspired to commit fraud and misled US bank regulators. Soon after the indictment was brought, Mr Clifford said he was innocent and wished a speedy trial in order to clear his name. But his lawyers argued subsequently that, because of a heart condition, he might die from the stress of standing trial. Mr Clifford's lawyers filed a motion this week to ask a New York judge to dismiss the BCCI charges, saying he was too ill to stand trial and had been 'grievously hurt' by the events of the past two years. The New York trial, tentatively set to begin next January 4, is expected to last three to four months. A trial in Washington on separate charges has been postponed. Mr Robert Bennett, the well-known lawyer representing Mr Clifford in Washington, said he did not know whether the New York motion to dismiss would be opposed. However, he said: 'If they oppose the motion to dismiss the case on health grounds, then in light of the overwhelming evidence, such a position is terribly unjust and is one more sign that they want to destroy Mr Clifford and not just prosecute him.'</p>

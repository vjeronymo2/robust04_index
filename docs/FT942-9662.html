			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Way ahead on CrossRail Sir, Your report that Mr Steven Norris, transport minister for London, said that the CrossRail project is not dead ('CrossRail rejection leaves BR plans in disarray', May 11) is to be welcomed. If the government is going to bring the project forward in another way, it must do so with the same urgency and resolve which has given us the Channel tunnel. While London will suffer if this much needed project is dropped, for it to be held in abeyance with continuing uncertainty will prolong blight for the occupiers and owners of property across central London, extending from beyond Paddington in the west to Liverpool Street in the east. Decisive action must now be taken either to bring the scheme forwards in another way or, if this is not to be done, to remove the blight which has now affected this part of London for almost three years, by removing the safeguarding of the route. Alternatively, the government should change the compensation code to enable residents and businesses to receive compensation for their true losses. Jeremy Bayliss, chairman, infrastructure market panel, Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, 12 Great George Street, London SW1P 3AD</p>

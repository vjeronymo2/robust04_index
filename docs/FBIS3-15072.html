Press Conference at Russian Defense Ministry"]    [Text] Russia's sensational political initiative in the  Balkans and the role that our Airborne Troops in the UN  peacekeeping forces played therein were discussed at a press  conference for Russian and foreign correspondents given 26  February by Colonel General Mikhail Kolesnikov, chief of the  Russian Armed Forces General Staff, and Colonel General Yevgeniy  Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne Troops.    From the moment that NATO presented the warring parties in  Bosnia-Herzegovina with an ultimatum, the Russian leadership has  taken a firm and unequivocal stance, Col. Gen. Mikhail  Kolesnikov told journalists, namely that a solution to the  Bosnian problem must be sought by peaceful, political means.  That is why, he went on to say, not only would the intended  aerial bombing of Serb positions not speed up the peace  settlement process but it might on the contrary stiffen the  sides' positions and lead to a fresh escalation of the war in  the Balkans.    The chief of the General Staff stressed that, by threatening  to carry out bombing raids on targets around Sarajevo, the NATO  command has thus put itself in an ambiguous position. It has  been publicly stated that the use of force should be the  instrument that will enable the situation around Sarajevo to be  normalized. In actual fact Western diplomats acknowledge that  bombing would be regarded in the North Atlantic Alliance as the  collapse of its strong-arm policy. That is why the alliance  greeted with relief the news that, owing to the efforts of the  Russian president and Russian diplomats, it had proved possible  to persuade the Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy arms from  a 20-km zone around Sarajevo, while our "blue helmets" in the UN  peacekeeping forces acted as guarantors of this plan's  implementation.    The arrival of the Russian soldiers is a key element in the  implementation of Russia's plan for a political settlement of  the crisis in Bosnia, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov noted. No matter  what people in the West are now saying about the fear that the  NATO ultimatum has supposedly inspired in the Serbs, he said,  trust played a crucial role in the Serbs accepting our  proposals. "The trust which they have in Russia and its  peacekeeping forces."    The chief of the Armed Forces General Staff told journalists  that, in response to UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali's  proposals, the Russian president asked the Federation Council to  agree to allocate an additional troop contingent of 300 men to  participate in the UN forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The upper  chamber of parliament took a positive view of this proposal 25  February. What is more, Col. Gen. Kolesnikov pointed out, the  Federation Council instructed the country's government on the  Russian Defense Ministry's submission to urgently resolve the  question of a pay raise for the personnel of the Russian UN  contingent in Yugoslavia. The Russian Defense Ministry in  conjunction with the Russian Foreign Ministry has also been  tasked with immediately formulating a system of social  guarantees for the personnel of the "blue berets" involved in  peacekeeping operations on Yugoslav territory.    Col. Gen. Kolesnikov said in conclusion that Russia is  starting to play a more active, autonomous role in settling the  crisis in the Balkans, bolstering its diplomatic efforts by  making a specific military and peacekeeping contribution. The  statements, initiatives, and actions by the Russian political  and military leadership and diplomats have once again proved  that it is not strong-arm but political means of settling the  Yugoslav conflict that are inexhaustible. And we will try to  stick to them in the future.    Col. Gen. Yevgeniy Podkolzin, commander of the Airborne  Troops, who returned from Belgrade 24 February as part of a  government delegation, told journalists how Russia's proposed  plan for settling the Bosnian crisis is being implemented. A  key element in this plan was for Russian "blue helmets" to come  to Sarajevo within a limited period. Despite the mountainous  locality and the sudden snowfall, Col. Gen. Podkolzin said, a  convoy of combat hardware with 400 Russian Airborne Troops led  by Colonel Viktor Vorobyev arrived in Bosnia precisely on  schedule. The local population -- not only the Serbs, but also  the Croats and Muslims -- gave our Airborne Troops a cordial,  enthusiastic reception like the frontline soldiers in victorious  1945.    At present, journalists were told by the commander of the  Airborne Troops, our "blue helmets" are performing a  peacekeeping mission in the Bosnian capital's so-called buffer  zone between the opposing sides -- the Serbs and Muslims -- they  occupy 16 km of the front. They have also taken Sarajevo  Airport under guard along with the French "blue helmets."    With regard to the plan for our Airborne Troops' future stay  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Col. Gen. Podkolzin pointed out that they  form the backbone of the UN 2d Russian battalion, which will be  stationed in the Sarajevo region. As for the additional  contingent of 300 men, whose posting to Bosnia-Herzegovina has  been approved by the Federation Council, it will be sent in  mid-March. Thus, the total number of Russian "blue helmets" on  Yugoslav territory will shortly reach 1,500 officers, warrant  officers, and contract troops, which, according to the commander  of the Airborne Troops, will also help boost Russia's  peacekeeping efforts in the Balkans.    In response to your KRASNAYA ZVEZDA correspondent's question  regarding guarantees of our soldiers' safety in Bosnia, where  the 100,000-strong Muslim Army includes around 10,000 mojahedin  who fought in Afghanistan, the commander of the Airborne Troops  said that this was the main topic of conversation during his  meeting with British General Rose, commander of the UN forces in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, who gave assurances that all steps are  currently being taken to ensure the safety of the "blue helmet"  contingent, including the Russians.    Other questions from journalists were also answered during  the press conference.</p>

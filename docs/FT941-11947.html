			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / End to airline subsidies urged: State-owned airlines must prepare for privatisation, say 'wise men' State-owned airlines in Europe can no longer expect to be drip-fed on subsidies and must prepare for eventual privatisation, according to a report sponsored by the European Commission. The report, by an independent committee of 'wise men' representing the European airline industry, rejected any rolling back of the limited deregulation already under way. But the committee softened its deregulatory message by offering European Union states the chance to give a 'one time, last time' dose of aid to support restructuring in an industry that lost Dollars 700m (Pounds 466m) in 1992. Mr Hermann De Croo, a former Belgian transport minister and the committee chairman, came out in favour of privatisation as the 'ultimate solution', but suggested that one last shot of state aid might be needed to put the industry back on its feet. A sick patient could not be expected to come off a drip immediately before starting to walk again, he said. Those seeking to extend the 'open skies' regime welcomed the report, which was published yesterday, even though the committee had stopped short of recommending an outright ban on state aid. Mr John MacGregor, the UK transport secretary, said the recommendations on extending liberalisation and generally eliminating state aid were a 'ringing endorsement' of British competition policy. The UK aviation industry - which, unlike some of its competitors, has to compete without state subsidy - was predictably more enthusiastic than that of Europe's troubled state carriers. British Airways - which only last month called on the European Commission to force Air France to repay a FFr1.5bn (Pounds 170m) capital injection from the French government - called the report a 'victory for the consumer and for competition'. British Midland called it a 'great step forward.' State-owned Air France and Alitalia were not ready to offer comment, but both are thought unlikely to welcome the findings. Air France has resisted rapid deregulation of the European airline industry, and is seeking a further FFr5bn state aid as it undergoes restructuring. Belgium's Sabena said the document was 'interesting' because it offered so many concrete recommendations. Because the panel's recommendations are non-binding, much will depend on political will to implement its findings. That will be tested when state-owned airlines request additional state aid. The Commission has already opened infringement proceedings against Air France, which last year faced French government opposition to its own efforts to shed labour and stem heavy losses. Other possible state aid applicants include Alitalia, Olympic Airways of Greece, Sabena, and Iberia of Spain. Mr De Croo said in Brussels yesterday that the panel had sought to strike a balance in the debate between liberalisation and protection, but he added: 'There is no solution to save this sector by going back to the past.' The committee also recommended that, within the next six months, governments should set a deadline of June 1995 to establish a common external aviation policy under the Treaty of Rome.

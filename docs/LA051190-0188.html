			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> EMPRESS ELIZABETH OF EUROPE?  </P> <P> Queen Elizabeth II should become Empress Elizabeth of Europe to ensure the  unity of Europe, a royalist said today.  </P> <P> "Monarchies are becoming more popular; there are kings and queens in Sweden,  Spain, Norway, Holland, a grand duke in Luxembourg, and, if the public had its  way, there would be further restorations," said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing  director of Burke's Peerage, bible of the aristocracy.  </P> <P> " 'Everybody loves a lord,' goes the phrase, and it is even truer that everyone  loves a king even more."  </P> <P> Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed concern last month that a united  Europe could jeopardize Queen Elizabeth's sovereignty.  </P></p>

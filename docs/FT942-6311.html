			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / International Company News: Saga Petroleum ahead after four months Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, lifted pre-tax profit for the first four months of the year to NKr659m (Dollars 89m) from NKr640m. The result was achieved in spite of lower crude oil prices, partly offset by an increase in oil sales and higher production volumes. Group operating revenue was little changed at NKr1.97bn while operating costs rose by NKr206m to NKr1.47bn due to higher depreciation, production and transport tariffs and carbon taxes. Operating profit fell by NKr156m to NKr502m. Saga blamed lower oil prices, which averaged NKr105 a barrel against NKr128 in the same period of 1993. Net financial items contributed NKr157m, against a charge of NKr18m. Petroleum output rose to 2m tonnes oil equivalent from 1.7m as crude oil sales increased to 12.2m barrels from 10m and gas sales to 187m cubic metres from 158m. Saga set a target for oil production from the Snorre field in 1994 of nearly 63m barrels. During the first four months, Snorre produced 21.6m barrels of oil. The group intends to submit a revised plan to domestic energy authorities during the second half of 1994 for approval of an expansion of the development and operation of Snorre.</p>

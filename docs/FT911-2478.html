			<p>910430 FT  30 APR 91 / International Company News: Israel is advised to break bank sale contract ISRAEL'S attorney general has advised the government not to sell the Israel Discount Bank group back to its original owner, Mr Raphael Recanati, because of charges against him for his role in a share price scandal. The IDB groupwas the first Israeli bank put up for sale by the government, which hopes to divest itself of its majority shareholding in the country's four leading commercial banks. The government acquired control of the banks in 1983, when it bailed them out of a share crisis that threatened to topple the banking system. The Recanati family submitted the only bid for IDB. The attorney general's recommendation is likely to to slow down the bank sale process in Israel. The treasury had hoped to finance at least part of the heavy costs of absorbing an influx of Soviet immigrants this year by selling off its assets. It had assumed that at least two big banks would be sold by the end of the year. In a legalopinion addressed to the finance minister and the central bank governor, the attorney general, Mr Joseph Harish, stressed that 'essential public needs' justified breaking a contract signed by the government and the Recanati family over the sale of IDB. The opinion noted that the charges pending against Mr Recanati were especially severe since they 'related specifically to the areas of banking and securities which, by nature, are based on special relations of trust with the public.' Mr Harish's legal opinion endorsed the view of Bank of Israel governor Mr Michael Bruno, who several months ago urged the government to suspend negotiations with the Recanati family until the court had ruled on the case. A ministerial economics committee, headed by finance minister Yitzhak Modai, then rejected the governor's recommendation, on the grounds that it would mean violating the contract signed with Mr Recanati. In his legal opinion, Mr Harish said that although the Recanati family had previously owned the bank, it still needed a permit from the Bank of Israel to purchase the bank. The attorney general recommended that the central bank not grant him this permit.</p>

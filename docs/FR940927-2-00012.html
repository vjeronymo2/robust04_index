The purpose of the award is to assist in the establishment of a network of colleges and universities within the metropolitan Washington, DC, Virginia, and Maryland area which have curricula addressing technologies and public policies in the following areas: Energy and the environment; Advanced materials development; Advanced manufacturing and process technology; High performance computing and communications; High energy and nuclear physics; Bioscience and biotechnology; Business and public administration professions supporting these technologies. The contemplated period of performance will be five (5) years October 1, 1994_September 30, 1999. The network will link the policy and program office of DOE with appropriate academic institutions to facilitate rapid interchange of information and concepts regarding the direction of Federal energy programs, policies and technologies. The Department is funding the first budget period (10/1/94&hyph;9/30/95) in the approximate amount of 75,000_Howard University will be cost sharing approximately $13,456, the total budget is estimated to be $88,377. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Please write the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Placement and Administration, ATTN: Rosemarie Marshall, HR&hyph;531.11, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed grant will provide funding to Howard University, which is a nationally recognized historically black academic institution with a broad curriculum. The Howard University School of Continuing Education (HUSCE) is one of the 17 schools and colleges of Howard University. HUSCE was established in April 1986 to meet the special higher-education needs of a rapidly expanding community of professionals, administrators, entrepreneurs, technical personnel, paraprofessionals and other adults. A part of the mission of the HUSCE is to serve as the central administrative unit for coordinating all continuing education at the University and for administering the Summer Sessions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The program is meritorious because it not only provides the interface desired in the above subject areas, but also supports the Department's objective of building a well-educated and diverse community in energy-related fields of study reflecting the core values articulated in the Department of Energy Strategic Plan. This project will promote education as well as provide local colleges and universities the opportunity to provide a curriculum to the community which will better prepare them to gain employment with the Department of Energy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the application represents a beneficial method for the Department to form partnerships with the academic community to foster educational growth closely attuned to national energy policy and technology development. The result should be university graduates which represent a diverse population with the foundation required to more adequately address the national energy challenges. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Craig S.

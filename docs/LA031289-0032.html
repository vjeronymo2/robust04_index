			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> THE TIMBER-FRAME HOME: DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, FINISHING  </P> <P> BY TEDD BENSON (The Taunton Press; 1988)  </P> <P> THE AUTHOR IS a builder with years of timber-framing experience, but he  broadened his scope for this book to integrate all elements of new-home  construction, including history of timber framing, design and insulation as  well as building techniques. The photos and diagrams are useful to any  non-builder contemplating construction or remodeling. The design chapter is  first-rate, the color photos are handsome, and the technical information is  rendered in thorough but understandable prose. ($24.95) JUDITH SIMS  </P></p>

			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Minister apologises for rail comment MR Roger Freeman, the transport minister, apologised yesterday for his comments suggesting that 'cheap and cheerful' trains could be provided for typists while civil servants and businessmen travelled in style. Mr Freeman said: 'I regret the phrases I used - they were clearly capable of misinterpretation.' He stood by the principle of price competition on the railways after privatisation, similar to airlines' pricing systems, but added that he had not wanted to imply there was to be a two-tier, class-conscious service.</p>

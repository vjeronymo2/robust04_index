			<p>940804 FT  04 AUG 94 / International Company News: Share offer launched for Hitachi offshoot Hitachi, the Japanese electronics group, is offering seven of its own shares for every 10 held by outside investors in Hitachi Sales Corporation, its distribution offshoot. The parent already has a 59 per cent stake in Hitachi Sales and the offer values the rest at some Y39.85bn (Dollars 398m). Shares in the subsidiary have fallen by Y95 since Hitachi announced its intentions last week, including a Y5 dip to Y625 yesterday. With Hitachi's own shares up Y51 since last Thursday's announcement and unchanged on the day at Y1,010, the all-scrip offer implies a bid premium of some 13 per cent. Hitachi Sales, with revenues of Y433bn in its latest year, operates a chain of retail outlets. These have been hit by the downturn in Japanese consumer spending, and profitability for the past two years has been marginal. The deal, says Hitachi, will streamline product development and marketing and rationalise management resources. Officials deny suggestions that the move may be a precursor to a withdrawal from consumer electronics, which represents about 10 per cent of its business. New lines are being sought for its stores. The company yesterday joined Sega Enterprises to market the Sega Saturn, a video-game machine to be launched in November.</p>

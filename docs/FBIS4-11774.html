			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 31 Mar (INA)--'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur,  member of the Iraq Command of the Arab Socialist Ba'th Party,  left Baghdad en route to Moscow today at the head of an Arab  Socialist Ba'th Party delegation to attend meetings of the  conference of the Russian Liberal Democrat Party [LDP] that is  due to convene there next week.    In a statement to INA, 'Abd-al-Ghani 'Abd-al-Ghafur said  that  the party delegation will hold talks with Russian parties and  political forces to promote ties between the Arab Socialist  Ba'th Party and these parties and forces. The party delegation  will also explain to these Russian parties and forces the  implications and dangers of the unfair anti-Iraq embargo that  continues due to the wishes of the United States and Zionism,  although Iraq has fulfilled its commitments per relevant UN  Security Council resolutions, including Resolution 687.    'Abd-al-Ghafur added that the improved positions of a few UN  Security Council permanent members, including Russia,  demonstrate the need to implement Paragraph 22 of UN Security  Council Resolution 687, and immediately lift the unfair embargo  clamped on Iraq.</p>

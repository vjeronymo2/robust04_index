			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim] </F>   [Text] The priority that Brazilian foreign policy has  traditionally attached to relations with Latin America is today  a constitutional principle. A natural consequence of our  geography, this priority is also linked with historical and  cultural factors and the existence of sizable joint  undertakings. Within the economic-commercial area, relations  with Latin American countries are equally intense. Brazilian  trade with ALADI [Latin American Integration Association]  countries accounts for 25 percent of our foreign trade.    This remarkable increase in the commercial flow toward Latin  America has occurred in the middle of a process marked by the  consolidation of regionalization and globalization of the world  economy and the exhaustion of the import replacement model in  Brazil. The conclusion of the Uruguay round of GATT [General  Agreement on Trade and Tariffs] talks has brought prospects for  strengthening the multilateral system of commerce. At a  regional level, the implementation of NAFTA has made it even  more obvious that it is necessary to accelerate the  consolidation of Mercosur [Common Market of the South] and the  implementation of the proposal for a South American Free Trade  Area (SAFTA).    Few times in history have been so favorable for promoting  cooperation with Latin American countries. The general  predomination of democratic governments is the foundation for  political coordination among the countries of the region and for  the emergence of political forums like the Rio Group. This  democratic atmosphere has to a considerable extent contributed  to overcoming old regional distrust and rivalry.    Among the initiatives aimed at strengthening confidence  among  the countries of the region is the understanding between Brazil  and Argentina, which concluded with the signing of the  historical Quadripartite Agreement of Nuclear Safeguards. The  approval of a set of amendments to the Tlatelolco Treaty and the  Declaration of Mendoza, which was signed before the Treaty for  Proscription of Chemical Weapons, are also part of that context.    Brazil has developed a tradition of confidence that pervades  our relations with all South American countries. The fact that  Brazilian diplomacy has been traditionally based upon the  principles of self determination, non-interference, and respect  for international law, has helped strengthen the reliability of  the country before its neighbors. We have also attained  valuable diplomatic achievements, which are represented by  agreements like the River Plate Basin Treaty, the Amazonas  Cooperation Treaty, the Treaty of Montevideo (ALADI), and the  Treaty of Asuncion (Mercosur).    Among the matters to which Itamaraty is attaching top  priority, I would mention first the negotiations over Mercosur  and the promotion of SAFTA. The liberalization process within  Mercosur is moving forward as scheduled, with strong, positive  impact on commercial exchange between the four partners, which  has practically tripled since the signing of the Treaty of  Asuncion. As of 1 January 1995 a free trade zone will come into  force in the Mercosur zone.    The proposal for the creation of SAFTA, which President  Franco announced at the last presidential meeting of the Rio  Group, has been welcomed, as I could see at the 8th ALADI  Council of Ministers' meeting and, more recently, during a  meeting with the economy and foreign ministers of Mercosur  countries.    At the bilateral level, high-level political contacts have  substantially intensified. President Itamar Franco met abroad  with Presidents Carlos Menem, Luis Alberto Lacalle, Rafael  Caldera, and Cesar Gaviria. He attended the inauguration of  Presidents Juan Carlos Wasmosy and Eduardo Frei, making valuable  contacts with those chiefs of state. He met in Brasilia with  the presidents of Argentina, Uruguay, and Guyana, and with the  then presidents-elect of Bolivia and Paraguay. In my capacity  as head of Itamaraty, I visited Argentina, Uruguay, Colombia,  and Bolivia.    This intensification of the meetings with top authorities of  neighboring countries has healthily diversified the mechanisms  for consultation and coordination, and the integration programs.  Standing mechanisms for regular consultation have recently been  instituted between Itamaraty and the Argentine Foreign Ministry.  A high-level Binational Commission was also created to  coordinate the work on various cooperation projects with  Venezuela. At a recent meeting in Leticia, Presidents Itamar  Franco and Cesar Gaviria installed the Brazilian-Colombian  Neighborhood Committee. The consideration of border problems in  those forums serves as a safeguard against the undesirable  politicization of matters that are more directly important for  local communities, opening prospects for cooperation whose  potential had not been properly developed.    In this spirit, Itamaraty has extended decisive support for  the initiatives aimed at promoting physical integration and the  integration of the power generation sectors with neighboring  countries, either at a multilateral level, like the  Paraguay-Parana waterway, or at a bilateral level, like the  Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline. This set of initiatives proves  that Latin America is not merely a diplomatic option for Brazil.  It is an area for priority action, to which the Brazilian  Government should devote top attention in permanent contact with  civilian society.</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Arts: Midsummer dance in Italy - Freda Pitt reviews a mixed season of successes and failures THE ITALIAN summer dance invasion this year has, as ever, been numerous in companies and varied in offerings. There have been celebrations of obvious anniversaries: Rossini was given a charming birthday tribute at the Ravenna Festival in Mischa van Hoecke's Adieu a l'Italie; Christopher Columbus became the subject of an extravaganza involving the entire ballet troupe of La Scala, Milan, with Carla Fracci as Queen Isabella, and Columbus himself taking rather a back seat. Alberto Mendez' choreography was at its best in scenes showing American Indians, but the accompaniment of Donizetti scores proved unexpectedly dull. The season proper began auspiciously with the arrival of Pina Bausch's production of Gluck's Iphigenie auf Tauris, which was shown first in Turin, and then in the Teatro dell' Opera, Rome. This staging dates from 1974, when Bausch had just joined the Wuppertal Opera - whose company made the journey to Italy - and it made quite a change to hear an orchestra tuning up before a Bausch performance. The singers were tucked out of the way in the theatre boxes so that the dancers had the stage to themselves, and the score was well presented by the Wuppertal forces under Peter Culke. Albeit this is an early production, Bausch has not sought to modify it, and she called upon three veterans of her company for the central roles: Malou Airoudou as Iphigenia; Dominique Mercy as Orestes, and Lute Forster as a terrifying King of the Scythians. Turin's Dance Festival, which also presented John Neumeier's Hamburg Ballet, the Prague National Ballet and London Contemporary Dance Theatre, chose to open in early June, a somewhat rash decision in view of our capricious weather. Within 30 minutes of the Hamburg Ballet's beginning Mozart Requiem the heavens opened, and umbrellas offered little protection from the downpour in the Parco Rignon, though the performers were under cover. We could admire the standard of the dancing in a work which intersperses Mozart's score with Gregorian chant (not without taste), and offers a decent view of Neumeier's slightly distorted classic manner. Music for the Turin performances is almost invariably recorded and this sad fact now obtains at the Spoleto Festival, where few successes were notched up this year and a decline in the dance content was discomfitingly evident. Little on view belonged without argument in the dance category, and Maguy Marin's Cortex - her first piece for her group after a two-year silence - contained much more talk than movement and was not noticeably original, save in its preponderance of speech. Her target, yet again, was the bourgeoisie, and more specifically bank clerks, who seem to be her bete noire. The need to translate the spoken text into Italian slowed the action even further, since not all the performers could speak fluently in a foreign language. At Spoleto's Roman Theatre the Bolshoy Theatre Grigorovich Ballet appeared with recorded accompaniment and no scenery. This is not the main Bolshoy troupe; but an off-shoot created two years ago, made up of some 50 very young dancers selected by Yury Grigorovich from various schools. The repertory originally comprised familiar Grigorovich choreography, but now (with the assistance of two of the dancers, Sergey Bobrov and Andrey Melanin) Grigorovich has produced a new work especially for the ensemble. This Elektra is set to excerpts from Richard Strauss's opera, with additional music from his Legend of Joseph. Grigorovich has, alas, asked more of his immature artists than they can yet give in terms of expressiveness. Technically they are carefully chosen, but interpretations were bland. Maria Mosina offered only a brave try as Elektra - her final dance of madness and death, veiled in black, could prove telling if given to a more assured ballerina. During a press conference, Grigorovich stated that he would certainly not invite Pina Bausch to Moscow, as he found no interest in her work. But her stark, barefoot treatment of the House of Atreus - in her Gluck staging - made a much stronger impression than Grigorovich's balletic version, with its style familiar from his Spartacus - especially in the male groupings. The lack of experience among the young Moscow dancers also affected their presentation of Raymonda's second act: good, clean technique was on display, but it was uncomfortably like an end-of-school performance. In Rome, the most extensive festival - Roma-Europa - included music, film, literature, as well as dance, from ten European countries. Its most talked-about dance event was a brief series of appearances by Sylvie Guillem and Laurent Hilaire. Their programme comprised a first part made up of works by Balanchine and Robbins, and a new 45-minute piece by Maurice Bejart, who tackled an impossible and self-imposed task of reconciling a taped text by Pier Paolo Pasolini with totally unconnected dance scenes of a couple's somewhat stormy relationship. The evening proved one of the season's successes.</p>

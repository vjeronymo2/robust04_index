			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / World Trade News: Japanese lobby group attacks numerical targets Leading Japanese academics and economists have called for their government to stand firm against US demands for numerical targets as part of the countries' bilateral trade talks. The 70 academics, in the Scholars for Free Trade lobby group, said the government should not compromise even if threatened by sanctions. Earlier, ,a senior Washington official said the US might have to resort to sanctions if the framework negotiations over Japan's trade surplus and access to the Japanese market failed. The US is targeting Japanese barriers to sales of vehicles and automotive parts, insurance, and government procurement of medical and telecommunications equipment. The negotiations are deadlocked over US demands for objective criteria to be set against which progress can be measured. In an open letter to the US and Japanese governments, the group said that, in a free market, the consumer should decide market shares. It was more important to create such a market than distort it by numerical targets.</p>

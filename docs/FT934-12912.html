			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / VW opts for four-day week in move to cut wage costs VOLKSWAGEN, Europe's biggest volume car maker, plans to introduce a four-day working week in its six German plants next year with the aim of cutting its wages bill by about 20 per cent. The proposal will be approved at a board meeting today, against a backdrop of gloomy forecasts for motor industry sales and of the company's failure to meet its target of breaking even this year. Four-day working is almost unheard of in German industry. That it is being introduced at such an important company is another clear indication that German trade unions are becoming increasingly amenable to flexible working practices under the influence of the worst recession since the second world war. Although workers will work four days, the factories will continue to produce for five days a week at reduced capacity. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, industry associations and the Bundesbank have all demanded increasing flexibility from employers and employees to avoid unemployment's reaching levels that might endanger the 'social peace'. Unemployment in Wolfsburg, where VW is based, is at present about 13 per cent of the local workforce. There are few alternative industrial suppliers in the town. The group expects sales of Volkswagen brand vehicles to stagnate in 1994 at this year's level of 1.4m vehicles, compared with 1.66m in 1992. Its Spanish workers were told last Friday that 9,000 jobs - 40 per cent of the total payroll - were to be lost at Seat, and one of the company's three factories was to be closed. In Germany, management is bound by an agreement with the government of Lower Saxony, its largest shareholder, and the company's workers councils, to limit job cuts to the 18,000 agreed last winter, when Mr Ferdinand Piech became chairman. That foresaw a domestic workforce of 100,000 by the end of 1994. Union officials said last week that the payroll had already been reduced to 108,000, and would be down to 103,000 by the end of this year. A nominal four-day week would allow the introduction of more flexible working, and the rapid reintroduction of longer hours if demand improved, a VW spokesman said yesterday. The project has been developed by Peter Hartz, VW's labour director since October. Volkswagen's employment needs are also being reduced by the efficiency improvements introduced since the arrival of the group's controversial production director, Mr Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua. New working methods have already increased productivity by 23 per cent, company officials said at the weekend. The impact on incomes of a basic 20 per cent pay cut in the pay bill would be softened by lower tax obligations, and possibly by spreading the payment of traditional Christmas and holiday bonuses over the full 12 months. Board and senior management salaries have been frozen at VW for the next 12 months; middle-managers are to have a 2 per cent rise; and a previously-agreed 3.5 per cent pay increase for hourly-paid workers will take effect on November 1.

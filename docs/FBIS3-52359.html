In a  statement issued today, the Islamic bloc noted the need to  defend the unity of Iraq's people and entity as an objective in  the interests of all parties in Iraq. The Islamic bloc called  for rejecting any plans or policies that would fragment or  divide Iraq.    The statement calls for the setting up of an alternative  regime in Iraq that respects human rights, particularly the  right to free expression, as stipulated in all laws, religions,  and international charters.    The Iraqi Islamic bloc added that America wants to use the  Iraqi opposition to pressure the Iraqi regime, if this regime  hesitates to carry out its orders. The bloc added that America  will hint to the Iraqi regime that the opposition will be the  alternative if that regimes rebels against it. America, the  bloc said, will only enable the opposition to topple the Baghdad  regime if it finds that it is more capable of achieving its  interests.    The Islamic opposition called on the forces of the Iraqi  opposition to be alert and cautious in their dealings with the  United States.</p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV SAYS HE WILL STEP UP PACE OF REFORM  </P> <P> Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that mistrust between East and  West was crumbling before the pressure of democratic change.  </P> <P> In a clear reference to reforms sweeping Eastern Europe, Gorbachev and Italian  Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti called in a joint political declaration for  democracy in every society.  </P> <P> "In some countries an in-depth and courageous revision of both domestic and  foreign policies is under way, and changes toward democracy are taking place,"  they said.  </P> <P> "Under the pressure of these factors, the curtain of mistrust between the East  and the West is crumbling," the declaration added.  </P> <P> It was signed after talks between the two leaders on the second day of  Gorbachev's visit to Italy.  </P> <P> Earlier, as he entered the talks in the renaissance Villa Madama overlooking  Rome, Gorbachev told reporters his reform of Soviet society was facing great  difficulties and he appealed for more cooperation from the West so military  expenditure could be cut.  </P> <P> But he said he would step up the pace of reform.  </P> <P> He said: "Now we are going through the most difficult phase because we have  entered a period which I would call one of profound transformation. Not  everything is going easily and there are difficulties, but there are no roads  for turning back.  </P> <P> "We are going to forge ahead and step up the pace of reforms."  </P> <P> He said through an interpreter he wanted to improve the quality of Soviet life.  "In order to achieve this, we would like to see more favorable external  conditions to enable us to reduce military expenditure."  </P></p>

			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Letter: A confused pay picture Sir, Your leader, 'Labour and the trade unions' (March 31), in seeking to comment on the political debate on public sector pay, confuses an already complex picture. To say that 'average pay in the public sector is now higher than in the private sector' is misleading on two counts. First, 'average pay' is a meaningless term in the context of national labour markets covering a huge variety of occupations including top civil servants, nurses, teachers, and cleaners. Second, pay in the public sector is not in any case 'higher than the private sector'. What we have seen this year is the government implementing review board recommendations for pay increases for certain groups, including nurses and teachers, that have generally been higher than the current level of settlements in the private sector. However, by focusing on the size of settlements for some groups, you ignore the fact that the level of pay of many public sector workers still seriously lags that of their private sector counterparts. Civil servants are a case in point. As a result of conscious government policy to hold down the pay of civil servants over the last few years their pay has lagged behind. This will inevitably create problems with recruitment and retention and pressure to close the gap again. The 'boom and bust' effects of government policy on public sector pay will only be avoided through a long-term commitment to a fair system of public sector pay determination involving independent pay reviews and national negotiations as appropriate. Public sector pay should not be used as a mechanism for short-term macroeconomic control. David Pelly, director of research, IPMS, 75-79 York Road, London SE1 7AQ</p>

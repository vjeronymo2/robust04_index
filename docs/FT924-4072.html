			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Ukraine's deficit takes off UKRAINE's budget deficit, which has grown to 44 per cent of gross domestic product, has pushed the country into hyperinflation, the government's senior economic minister said yesterday. Mr Viktor Pynzenyk, deputy prime minister and the architect of Ukraine's reform programme, said the deficit had more than tripled since the summer. But price liberalisation and rapid privatisation measures were being delayed by conservatives in the cabinet, he said. Reformers hope the cabinet will decide tomorrow on a decree freeing prices in the Ukraine. Mr Oleksandr Savchenko, the government's top economic adviser, said the underlying monthly inflation rate was 60 per cent in November and he expected it to rise to 100 per cent this month. The Ukrainian coupon is trading at 730 coupons to the dollar, a near 300 per cent depreciation since August.</p>

			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / UK Company News: SFO looks into alleged advance fee frauds A SOLICITOR who received a controversial Pounds 2.1m payment from the pension fund of Belling, the cooker manufacturer which collapsed last year, has been declared bankrupt claiming debts of more than Dollars 250m (Pounds 167m). It has also emerged that Mr Charles Deacon, a 51-year-old solicitor from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, is at the centre of a Serious Fraud Office inquiry into alleged advance fee frauds which may extend to the US. It is unclear whether Mr Deacon's debts relate to money which has actually changed hands or funds promised. However, Mr Colin Davis of WH Matthews &amp; Co, solicitors for Mr Deacon, said yesterday that the official receiver had been made aware of claims by Mr Deacon against parties outside the UK - involving both sums owed and indemnities given - which would exceed the Dollars 254m debts. Independent trustees were appointed by creditors last week to investigate Mr Deacon's debt claims. If substantiated, the size of the debts would make this one of the largest bankruptcies on record, approaching the Pounds 180m owed by Mr George Walker, the former head of leisure group Brent Walker, now facing charges of theft. Mr Deacon appears to have acted on occasion as a broker for companies seeking a refinancing. He played a key role in one deal with Belling involving offshore family interests of Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who has been linked to the flotation of several natural resource companies. Events at two of these companies, Richmond Oil &amp; Gas and Butte Mining, are being investigated by the SFO. The solicitor agreed to hold an advance fee of Pounds 2.1m, paid by Belling out of the pension fund, in return for a promised loan of Dollars 50m to be arranged by Global Prospect Funding, where Mr Deacon was appointed a director in 1990. When the loan was not forthcoming, security for the fee was provided by Finchley Investments, an offshore vehicle for Smith family interests. The following month, Belling collapsed with debts of more than Pounds 28m. The security - a stake in Western &amp; Pacific, a Canadian mining company which was 57.4 per cent owned by Mr Smith and his family - is currently worth significantly less than its original CDollars 1.75m (Pounds 910,000) value. Last month, trustees of the Belling pension fund, The Law Debenture Trust, won a court judgment against Mr Deacon for Dollars 3.5m. Mr Deacon, who has not practised as a solicitor since December, was declared bankrupt in April following a petition from Cheshire-based Monarch Assurance. The petition followed a writ in 1991 against Mr Deacon, alleging that he had undertaken to provide Dollars 35m for Mr Patrick Taylor, Monarch's managing director, but failed to do so. Monarch won a judgment against Mr Deacon for the Dollars 35m.</p>

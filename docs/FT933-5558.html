			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Burns Philp increases payout BURNS Philp, the Australian food technology group, has raised its dividend to 17 cents from 15.5 cents a share following a 20 per cent increase in net earnings to ADollars 110.1m (USDollars 74m) for the six months ended June. Directors said the result, achieved on a 19 per cent sales rise to ADollars 2.68bn, reflected higher earnings in 14 of the group's 16 divisions, despite slow trading in most markets. The company's biggest profit earner was the food and fermentation division, which lifted its net contribution from ADollars 62.3m to ADollars 86.6m. The hardware side improved earnings from ADollars 22.9m to ADollars 23.4m and investment division profit rose from ADollars 19.1m to ADollars 26.5m. Mayne Nickless, the diversified transport and security group, has reported a steep fall in profits for the year ended June. After-tax profit fell 66.6 per cent to ADollars 58.8m on a 2 per cent slide in total operating revenue to ADollars 2.84m. The dividend is down from 35 cents to 30 cents a share. The result included a ADollars 47.1m abnormal loss on write-downs at the European transport operations. In the previous year a ADollars 77.6m abnormal profit had been taken in, mainly on the sale of shares in Amcor.</p>

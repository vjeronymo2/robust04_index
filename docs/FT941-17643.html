			<p>940101 FT  01 JAN 94 / Food and Wine: The bread's the thing - Pasta mania is getting out of hand. Pizza is giving way to polenta. But breads are big news for '94 In cookery, as in other things, there are booms and busts, and the wince factor in food enters the new year alive and kicking. The kiwi fruit, with its fresh fruit taste and its brilliant jet and emerald colouring had less than 15 minutes of true foodie fame before it became the darling of degenerated nouvelle cuisine - instantly earning the soubriquet of ingredient non-grata at top tables. So passe is the kiwi fruit now that even country pubs allegedly serving 'good pub grub' are liable to stop short of using it to garnish their microwaved Tex-Mex and deep-frozen red snapper. Other fresh ingredients that have come in and out of fashion recently include dwarf corn and mangetout peas. Good riddance to the corn: the corn I have sampled has been tasteless. As for the mangetout, like the kiwi fruit it was just too pretty for its own good. And more often than not it defied the Trades Descriptions Act - with all those inedible threads at the seams it ought to have been called mangemoitie. The vogue for kumquats is on the wane but the onslaught of the ubiquitous sun-dried tomato seems relentless and I feared suffocation at Christmas under a surfeit of fancy filo parcels - pouches, purses and crackers crammed with mincemeat and savoury titbits. The red meat market seems destined to go on decreasing. The pig, once known as the gentleman who pays the rent, is due for a revival but it will probably be years before top quality British sausages and well cured hams are the norm and caul, pigs tails, trotters and Bath chaps are readily available again. Interest in game is growing. In poultry, chicken and turkey are less fashionable than they were. Guinea fowl now seems more alluring than quail. Goose and duck are the thing with confits taking over from magrets as the smart items of the 1990s. As for fish, diver- and line-caught are the buzz words now, and pickled fish looks set to pick up nicely, from salted anchovies to lightly cured herrings. The olive oil boom, which began with French and Italian extra virgins, is now slicking its way across the Atlantic. Californian oils have already started to reach our shores. I love olive oil but think it is time to redress the balance a little and remember how delicious good butter can be. Butter is after all the fat of the north and small local farmers making it in Britain with love and care deserve at least some of the support we lavish so freely on estate bottled olive oils. Vinegars, like oils, continue to rise in popularity with properly aged balsamic vinegar from Modena, sherry vinegar from Jerez, English mulberry vinegar and prune vinegar from France earning pride of place in smart larders. I cannot see that Italy will lose its lead in the food fashion stakes for a long while yet but the cuisines of south-west France, Portugal and Turkey are all looking healthy and interest in our own British cooking is growing stronger. Thai cooking, fragrant with lemongrass and star anise, hovers meanwhile on the brink. Will it boom or will it not? Pasta mania is getting out of hand. Pizza is giving way to polenta in some circles. Rice is on the up and breads are very big news. The success of ciabatta and focaccia was exceptional but the general trend in breads is set fair. Even sourdough, appealing to a minority market with its darker, sourer taste, is gaining ground. While British treats - potato cakes, pikelets, Lincolnshire plum bread, barley bannocks, Aberdeen rowies and co - are enjoying a new winning streak. BREAKFAST BREAD (makes 2 small loaves) Here is a bonus since breads are in the ascendancy and so are the foods of south-west France, where the best prunes come from. Dark nuggets of prune stud this dough. Earl Grey tea provides the liquid element. Cinnamon and orange zest complete the aromatics. Breakfast Bread can be toasted carefully but I prefer to nibble it just as it is, without any butter or marmalade, with my early morning cuppa. 1 lb unbleached white bread flour, preferably stone ground; 1 x 7 g packet of easy-blend yeast; 8 oz large, squashy prunes;  1/2 pt very milky Earl Grey tea; 2 oz butter; 1 1/2 oz caster sugar; generous  1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon; 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest; beaten egg to glaze. Mix together by hand the flour, yeast, sugar, cinnamon and citrus zest (or use a food processor or a food mixer with a dough hook). Dice the butter, put it into a small saucepan with half the tea and heat gently until the butter is melted. Add the rest of the tea, which should be cold, and pour the mixture onto the dry ingredients. Mix and knead to a smooth and elastic dough. Cover and leave to rise until doubled in size. A slow rise in a cool place is best. Knock back the risen dough and work the prunes (stoned and chopped small) into it. Divide the dough in two, shape each piece neatly and drop it into a small loaf tin. Cover and leave to prove for 1-1 1/2 hours. Glaze with beaten egg and bake on a hot baking sheet at 400`F (200C) gas mark 6 for about 40 minutes until cooked right through. Cool on a rack before eating or wrapping and storing.</p>

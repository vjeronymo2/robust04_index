			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Reason for Change: The ten-year expiration of the Final Judgment should not leave open an argument that the otherwise perpetual confidentiality obligations of Pilkington's FLAs somehow revive upon its expiration, as provided in VII(A). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Pilkington Should Not Be Able To Assert U.S. Trade Secret Rights Against Any U.S. Licensee or Non-Licensee <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Change: Paragraph IV.A.2 should be changed to read: ``No defendant shall assert against any U.S. LICENSEE any proprietary FLOAT TECHNOLOGY know-how rights that it may have or claim with respect to any FLOAT TECHNOLOGY.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reason for Change: Paragraph 24 of the DOJ Complaint states that ``Pilkington's maintenance and continued enforcement of the licensee restraints described above was not justified by any intellectual property rights of substantial value.'' Pilkington's core float glass technology was disclosed in numerous patents that have long expired, placing that technology in the public domain. Moreover, unpatented Pilkington float glass technology has been publicly disclosed in substantial part. The Department of Justice has determined that the remaining secret unpatented technology consists largely of ``engineering solutions with no substantial value over other, equally efficacious engineering alternatives.'' Complaint &para;24. Moreover, Attorney General Reno, in announcing the consent decree, said that ``Pilkington had agreed that much of its technology is in the public domain.'' ``British Company Agrees to Settle Justice Department Antitrust Suit,'' New York Times, p. 1, May 27, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If Pilkinton no longer holds intellectual property of substantial value, there is no reason why it should be allowed to assert trade secret rights against any United States licensee or United States non-licensee with respect to any Float Technology in existence as of the date of the Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Forfeiture of patent rights is a common remedy for the abuse of patent rights giving rise to antitrust violations and there is no reason that that remedy should not be applied to Pilkington's abuse of its alleged trade secret rights, particularly in view of the Department's view that its technical information is without redeeming value. Comp. Imp. Stat. at 10; Complaint &para; 26. Given Pilkington's demonstrated propensity to pursue its monopolistic practices through unjustified assertions of propriety trade secret rights and given the trivial nature of Pilkington's claimed ``trade secrets,'' there is no sufficient justification for allowing Pilkington to retain these weapons empowering it to use threats and litigation based on asserted trade secrets to continue to its monopolistic practices. Paragraph IV.A.2 should be modified accordingly. This suggested change is not meant to prevent Pilkington from seeking to protect any bona fide trade secrets developed after the date of entry of this Final Judgment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW STYLES OF ELECTRICAL PLUGS ARE SAFER  </P> <P> You can increase your safety and protect your appliances from abuse by  replacing old and worn electrical plugs and receptacles with newer styles  offering extra safety features and conveniences.  </P> <P> Maintenance Technology magazine says that to secure a plug that might be easily  knocked out of the receptacle, a straight-blade plug with a locking screw can  be used. This type of connection is especially important for appliances such as  refrigerators, where the result of an accidental disconnection can mean real  trouble.  </P> <P> An angle plug should be used when you want to place furniture or an appliance  closer to the wall. An angle plug lays flat against the wall instead of  protruding from it. As for receptacles, isolated ground receptacles should be  used whenever sensitive electrical equipment such as computers require a pure,  noise-free ground. Surge suppression receptacles help protect electronic  equipment from damage caused by transient voltage spikes.  </P></p>

			<p>930208 FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (4): Damage limitation - The Economy After nearly a decade in the economic doldrums caused first by revolution and then war, Iran faced the massive task in the summer of 1988 of rebuilding its infrastructure, its cities and villages occupied or bombed by Iraq, and most critically its oil production and export facilities. Unlike Iraq, the Iranian regime at least emerged from the conflict without the huge weight of debt which proved so difficult for President Saddam Hussein to tolerate and helped spur the invasion of Kuwait. Whatever else was said about Iran during the 1980s, its management of its external finances drew almost universal praise. Iran paid its debts promptly and was a sound risk. Probably the biggest single error made by the government in the past four years has been to put that hard-won reputation at risk. Iran's reconstruction and economic development plans need access to western capital. There is, of course, a substantial amount that can be generated domestically, but with annual hard currency revenues unlikely to top Dollars 16bn-Dollars 17bn in the next few years, the demands for investment have to take their place in the queue along with other pressing priorities. In the oil and industrial sectors, along with the free trade zones, it has been hoped that a significant part of the investment would come from outside the country. How much damage has been done to those prospects is not yet clear. But the alarm bells are ringing in all the leading export credit guarantee agencies of the industrialised world. What had been nervousness six months ago has now developed into deep concern and the strong possibility exists that one of the biggest agencies could soon remove cover for Iran. Iran's problems grew from its attempt to undertake a multi-billion-dollar reconstruction programme using primarily short-term loans and its loss of control over letters of credit issued by the commercial banks. Added to this has been the opportunity to buy cut-price Russian weaponry for cash. The situation might have been more manageable had oil revenues come up to expectations. Instead, the surge in prices that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990 was enough to tempt Iran into a more expansive spending programme, but not enough to sustain it. Official figures need to be treated with some caution, but the trends are clear enough. At the end of the last financial year (March 21, 1991) Iran admitted to oil revenues of Dollars 15.8bn and imports of nearly Dollars 25bn. In fact, imports were probably Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn higher than stated and, even allowing for non-oil exports of Dollars 2bn, this would still have left the country with a trade deficit of more than Dollars 10bn. The first hint that Iran was having difficulties meeting short-term obligations emerged about nine months ago - and seemed to have reached a plateau over the summer, but again gathered pace in November and December. Officials from Bank Markazi, the central bank, travelled to Japan, Germany and other European countries at the end of the year in an attempt to reassure foreign banks and export credit agencies that the difficulty was primarily technical and would be resolved within a few months. In Tehran, close aides of President Rafsanjani admitted the problem, but not its size. They say an inquiry is underway into banking practices and accounting procedures. What appears to have happened is that the central bank, having permitted the commercial banks to open letters of credit without official approval, did not have in place a mechanism for tracking the volumes and amounts which were then issued. At the same time, foreign currency allocations to ministries increased sharply. The effects on Iran are visible. The country is in the middle of its biggest consumer boom since well before the revolution and so far there is no sign of it running out of steam. Officials insist that 50 per cent fewer letters of credit have been issued in the current financial year and there will be a correspondingly large fall in the value of imports. Even if this is so, it will not resolve the more immediate issue over the swelling backlog of unpaid letters of credit. The government says that there is no more than Dollars 1bn outstanding. Other western estimates put the figure at closer to Dollars 3bn, and fear that there is a substantial sum still in the pipeline which could range between Dollars 7bn and Dollars 10bn, anywhere from a half to two-thirds of expected oil revenues. Iran has hinted at some success in re-financing part of the outstanding amount and officials in Tehran want to believe that competition between countries for business will prevent the crisis from deepening. Much the same thinking lies behind Iran's refusal to accept growing western demands for sovereign guarantees for new loans. A large part of the outstanding short-term debt could probably be converted into much longer maturities if Iran would guarantee the amounts. Similarly, the prospects for financing some of the country's most ambitious infrastructure and industrial projects would look much more feasible if investors were provided with that extra reassurance. But awareness of the hostility of the parliament to sovereign borrowing  - smacking as it does of foreign dependence - makes the government reluctant to introduce the issue. It is also probable that relatively few people in Tehran are fully aware of the amounts outstanding on short-term repayments. The government claims greater success in handling the scarcely less sensitive issue of exchange rates. In his budget speech in December, Mr Rafsanjani pledged further moves to unify the exchange rate by removing an increasing number of items from the official rate of IR70 to the dollar. Only essential items, such as basic foodstuffs and medicines, will remain at that IR70 rate, some items for industry will continue at IR600 to the dollar but almost everything else will be at the floating rate, currently about IR1,500 to the dollar. Moving all items on to the floating rate would have a hugely inflationary impact, especially as at least 20 per cent of imports are believed to fall into the category of basic goods and medicines. How far down this road Mr Rafsanjani is willing to venture will be primarily a political judgment. The government is preparing to increase subsidies massively as more basic items are moved onto the floating rate. It also claims to be holding enough dollars in reserve to satisfy demand and steady the rate when the rial is finally fully floated. If the government intends to keep its pledge to the International Monetary Fund in order to qualify for balance of payments support it has to unify exchange rates by March next year. Some officials at the central bank want the government to act more decisively. They believe a short, sharp adjustment, although painful, is preferable to a long drawn-out process during which the impact of the reforms will be dissipated. The Ministry of Finance and Economy clearly prefers the more cautious approach and so far seems to be winning the argument. What impact the gravity of Iran's external payments situation will have on the government's room for manoeuvre will be the main focus of attention over the next six months.</p>

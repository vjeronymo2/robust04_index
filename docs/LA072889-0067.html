			<p><P> July 28, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS ANGRY AS AIRPORT ADDS A FLIGHT;  </P> <P> SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOLD OF FEDERAL EXPRESS TALKS, NEIGHBORS SAY  </P> <P> Some neighbors of Burbank Airport are angry that the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena  Airport Authority has granted Federal Express permission to operate one flight  per day from the airport beginning Aug. 7.  </P> <P> Tom Paterson of the Valley Village Homeowners Assn. in North Hollywood said the  public should have been made aware of negotiations between the airport and  Federal Express.  </P> <P> "It's been kept very quiet," Paterson said of the negotiations, adding that  Federal Express "could have been kept out if there been public discussion about  this from the beginning."  </P> <P> Federal Express' application to fly from the airport was unanimously approved  by the authority on Monday. Company officials said that beginning Aug. 7 the  carrier will dispatch a Boeing 727 each weeknight at 7 p.m. from Burbank to  Memphis, Tenn., where packages handled by the carrier are sorted and forwarded.  </P> <P> The airport handles a daily average of 65 jetliner departures.  </P> <P> Airport officials acknowledged that they had been negotiating with Federal  Express for more than a year, but said they had no legal obligation to inform  the public.  </P> <P> "We're not operating in some park," said Thomas Greer, director of Airport  Services. "This is part of the national air transportation system. If Federal  Express complies with the noise rules instituted by the authority, there's no  way the authority can keep them out."  </P> <P> Burbank City Councilwoman Mary Lou Howard, who is on the airport board, said  she was unconcerned by one daily flight by Federal Express, as long as the  package carrier does not add more.  </P> <P> Paterson said he plans to send a letter to Federal Express officials inviting  them to meet with area homeowners next week to discuss flight patterns,  aircraft safety and future plans.  </P> <P> "We want to find out what they're up to, what their long-term plans are for  Burbank," Paterson said.  </P> <P> Richard Close of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. said his group also would  like to meet with Federal Express officials.  </P> <P> "At this point in time there's no way we can keep them out," Close said. "We  don't have the power to keep them out. We just want to work with them to be  good neighbors because the fact is, every new airline at the airport creates  new problems and safety risks."  </P> <P> Federal Express officials declined to comment on whether they would meet with  the homeowners. "We've been approved by the airport authority, and that's about  all we can say," said Armand Schneider, corporate spokesman for Federal  Express.  </P></p>

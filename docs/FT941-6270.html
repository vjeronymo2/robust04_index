			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Royal Bank of Scotland plans system changes Royal Bank of Scotland is to introduce a new way of handling its business and personal customers and is to spend Pounds 20m on introducing the system first in its branches in Glasgow. The changes will later spread to the rest of Britain as part of a programme that began two years ago and is costing up to Pounds 400m. The new system involves senior staff concentrating on specific categories of customer rather serving both large and small customers. Branch managers will stay in their jobs for at least four years, longer than at present. It also entails installing more cash machines at branches and other sites, and a 24-hour telephone banking service.</p>

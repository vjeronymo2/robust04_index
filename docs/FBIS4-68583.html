			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Economic Sciences Professor Mikhail </F> Sidorov, State Duma deputy: "What Kind of Reforms Are These if  They Find the People an Obstacle?! Notes on State's Income and  Expenditure in 1994"]    [Text] Moscow -- So then, the federal budget for 1994.  The government's plan puts income at 120 trillion rubles [R]  and expenditure at R183 trillion. You can see that once again  the population is trying to spend more than it pays in tax.  This is once again an obstacle to the reformers. Just how can  the deficit be covered? The government sees two main ways --  the first is Central Bank loans to the tune of R38 trillion, and  the second is foreign loans totaling R19.3 trillion. The third  source of funding, which is the main source in civilized  countries, is through state securities bought by banks,  enterprises, and the population. But Russians have failed to  grasp their advantages and have hardly been buying these bonds,  which is again hampering the reforms.    On what terms does the government raise loans? It is wiser  in this respect than enterprises and the population. Just try  getting a 10-year bank loan at 10 percent. You will be referred  to a psychiatrist. But the authorities have favorable terms,  they are borrowing the R38 trillion they need from Gerashchenko  at 10 percent interest over a 10-year term.    I would like to see the reaction of the chairman of the U.S.  Federal Reserve if the White House asked him for a loan at 1  percent when the rest of the economy was paying 7 percent. It  would hardly be considered humorous.    Now to turn to the second source -- foreign loans to the  tune  of R19.3 trillion. Who will provide them -- America, Japan, the  FRG? This means that we take out loans in dollars, process them  through speculators on the foreign exchanges, and fill the  cracks in the budget with "worthless" rubles. Later,  admittedly, these loans -- which certain journalists often call  aid -- will have to be repaid. In oil, gas, and gold. Does it  never strike you that Russia, which extracts up to 200 tonnes of  gold a year, has almost none left for itself?    Let's talk about budget revenue -- that part of the earnings  of enterprises and the population which is transferred to the  treasury by means of tax. The higher production volumes and  profits are, the higher the revenue side of the budget is too.  And, conversely, when there is a recession, the revenue side  shrinks -- as does, consequently, the expenditure side. That is  the basis of a country's full-fledged budget.    Naturally, our "reformers" could not fail to be alarmed  about  this fundamental principle. In 1991 production and national  income were already falling. In order to bring budget revenue  more into line with expenditure in 1992, the reformers  introduced value-added tax [VAT] at a level unprecedented  anywhere in the world -- 28 percent. This was a truly  "revolutionary" breakthrough in economic science and practice.  Production began to fall, fiscal pressure was increased, and  price-setting was handed over to monopoly enterprises and  merchant speculators. And we waited for the economic miracle.  Once again enterprises and the population were unable to grasp  and implement these "brilliant" ideas. The economy went to the  dogs.    But the government gleefully reports that the reforms are  making progress and that their policy should not be changed.  Obviously, this is a mixture of economic ignorance and criminal  intent.    The authorities of the report to the State Duma "On the  Federal Budget in 1994" repeatedly stress that all their  calculations are based on the existing tax system -- the same  system which helped bring about the production slump. We do not  need any subtle calculations to realize that the production  slump in 1994 will be more than the 7-8 percent which the  budget's compilers were aiming for. Consequently, there will be  no way to collect the R120 trillion in taxes which are the basis  of the revenue side of the budget.    The reforms have also set about foreign economic activity  with a will. With a sensible approach organized for the benefit  of the population this could, of course, be a "goldmine." It  accounts for almost 23 percent of revenue. Twenty-three rubles  in every R100 comes from export and import duties, funds  realized by the centralized export of output, and other income.  Not bad, right? But this money comes from the sale of  nonrenewable natural resources. And the export quotas and  licenses issued to hundreds of dubious firms help to promote the  excessive and undeserved enrichment of a narrow group of people,  the growth of social tension, and the spread of crime.    Moscow and St. Petersburg are already importing more than  half of their food, while their own production is collapsing and  food is rotting away in warehouses. It seems that this food is  uncompetitive. But the point is that foreign-currency food  loans have allowed a group of "entrepreneurs," who have paid off  the powers that be, to get rich. The newspapers and television  shape the opinions required for the continuation of this  predatory activity. They have no time for the  "Russian-speakers" working in the confectionery industry, at  meat combines, or at enterprises in the Russian agro-industrial  complex, which is collapsing faster than other sectors of the  economy.    What about federal budget expenditure? The reformers, in the  manner to which they are accustomed, are talking about two  extreme options. The first is the best option, the government  option. Reducing expenditure to a minimum -- loans, support for  enterprises, defense orders, pensions, and spending on science,  education, and culture. Under these circumstances there will be  financial stabilization and low inflation. Just what  unemployment will be like, how much people will have to pay to  survive, how far production will collapse, and what will happen  to the defense complex, science, and health is not so important.  But there will be financial stabilization. The Malthusian  approach.    The second option, which the reformers talk about with  nostalgia, is connected with meeting the needs of ministries and  departments for capital investment, subsidies, pensions, and  other spending on social needs. It would then be necessary to  spend not R183 trillion, but, staggeringly, R237 trillion.  Inflation, the draft's authors assure us, would then be 32  percent a month by the year's end. It would be the ruin of the  state. The government, of course, cannot go along with all  these petitioners.    There is still life in that cherished old dog of the Gaydar  supporters -- monetarism. The authors of monetary theories are  people with a mercenary and usurious slant of mind. Their  philosophy and the aim and purport of their activity revolves  around money, trading, exchange, and banking operations.  Long-term fundamental processes take a back seat as far as they  are concerned.    It is interesting to note that the draft law on the federal  budget has been submitted for discussion by the State Duma,  which is to receive a government ruling [zaklyucheniye] on its  actions. Otherwise they might confuse "red" articles with  "brown" articles. Or again revive militarism and help idle  scientists. Or encroach on the "holy of holies" -- foreign  economic activity.    Nonetheless, the budget, as democratic gentlemen on both  sides of the ocean are noting, is militarist in nature. It is  planned to spend R37.1 trillion (20.3 percent) on defense. The  largest item in the budget. This money will be used to maintain  the Army, pay for state orders from defense industry  enterprises, and for the Russian troop withdrawal from the newly  independent states.    After all, the collapse of the unified system for protecting  the state and the unified defense industrial complex along with  the collapse of the state will not make it possible in the  foreseeable future to create a similarly reliable system to  allow people to live in their fatherland without fear. Just  look at how greedily the eyes of almost all our neighbors burn  at the thought of Russian lands. What are we supposed to do --  hand them over and embrace pacifism?    The second biggest item on the expenditure side of the  budget  is state support for national economic sectors -- R33.2 trillion  (18.1 percent). This section looks quite puzzling. It lists  the federal programs on Chernobyl, housing for servicemen, the  fuel and energy complex, transportation, conversion, and so  forth that have been examined and adopted by the government.  What remains unclear is the funding mechanism -- who  specifically will get the money and where is the guarantee that  it will be utilized in a targeted way?    Experience shows that budgetary funds channeled through  commercial banks and different funds help to make intermediary  speculators rich. Russian producers receive only part of the  funds. But even then, the leaders of enterprises and the small  enterprises, foreign economic structures, and other market  formations that have flourished under them often defend their  own market interests. These people, needless to say, are  thinking about their own pockets.    The funding sources for national economic investment break  down into domestic (R19 trillion) and foreign (R12 trillion).  The latter will be used to buy agricultural equipment,  transportation equipment, and medical equipment in the United  States, Germany, Britain, Japan, and other countries. That is,  as is the case with agriculture, we are supporting Western  producers while destroying our own.    Compare the R12 trillion channeled by the Western countries  to Russia to ensure that it buys their technology and equipment  with the budgetary spending on the conversion of Russian defense  complex enterprises. It turns out that our reformers love  Western enterprises 16 times more than Russian enterprises.    It will take major amounts of investment to seriously change  the structure of production and renew it, but this money is  lacking and, clearly, will not be forthcoming in 1995 either.  It will take the Russian economy more than two or three years  to get out of the hole which we have dug for it.    There are many more interesting points in the reformist 1994  budget. Admittedly, it is already April -- we have been living  through the first and second quarters without any legislative  examination of the budget. But, after all, someone was  preventing the government from drawing up the budget in  November-December 1993. There was no Supreme Soviet and no  State Duma either, but they were impeding things too. So was  winter, and the elections, and surging prices -- what prices  would be used to calculate the budget? And so did the ruble's  steady fall against the dollar -- what level should be chosen  for the calculations?    There is a draft budget. Now the State Duma will cause  problems -- why, it will ask, is only R591.7 billion being  allocated to federal migration and resettlement programs when a  minimum of 1 million refugees are expected from the CIS  countries? That equates to around R600,000 per person. That is  enough to buy a tourist tent. Yet at the same time loans to the  CIS countries' national regimes total R533 billion.    But it is hard to believe the figures in the draft budget.  Who knows what inflation will be like -- after all, in early  1993 they had wanted to hit the 5-7-percent-a-month mark by the  end of the year, but, it seems, the Supreme Soviet got in the  way, as did people, who for some reason wanted to receive their  pay. That is why inflation went higher. How many enterprises  will still be left by the year's end? Judging from the size of  state "support" and the authorities' investment policy -- not  many.    But it is quite obvious that, with the current system of  taxes, foreign economic policy, rivalry between the regions and  the center, and the government's inability to carry out phased  and well-considered reforms, the current budget will not be able  to improve the economic situation. The annual budget is in any  case more suited to trading operations rather than to an  assessment of investment projects and serious structural changes  in the national economy. The destructive reformers, living day  by day with their vindictive attitude to the past and their  passion for foreign economic operations, will not be able to  reassure the country. They have drawn up the current budget any  old how and will fail to carry it out -- as was the case in 1992  and 1993.</p>

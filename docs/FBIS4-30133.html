			<p>BFN     [Text] The yen (Y)-dollar rate temporarily plunged below  Y100 to a dollar on 22 June. In this regard, top officials of  the four economic organizations pointed out that "it is a big  shock to the economic world because there were signs that the  Japanese economy was about to begin recovering from stagnation  and that the yen exchange rate was becoming stable," (according  to Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Japan Federation of  Economic Organizations). The top officials demanded that the  government take concrete measures, including income tax  reduction and deregulation, to reduce Japan's trade surplus.  They also asked the monetary authorities to strongly intervene  in the money market.    Chairman Toyoda also said: "An appropriate level of the yen-  dollar exchange rate is between Y110 and Y120. Actual gross  national product for fiscal 1994 will drop by 0.8 percent if the  exchange rate of Y100 to the dollar continues for a year."    Ken Hayami, chairman of the Japan Federation of Employers  Associations, stressed: "We may even have industrial  stagnation, increased unemployment, and social unrest if we  allow yen's abnormally high value, which does not reflect the  actual economic conditions." Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the  Japan Chamber o Commerce and Industry, expressed his concern,  saying that "it will be a serious blow to small-to-medium-sized  enterprises."    Yu Hayami, representative secretary of the Japanese  Association of Corporate Executives, stated: "The dollar fell  against all currencies as a result of apprehension about  possible inflation in the United States and other things. Even  the United States cannot tolerate the dollar's further decline."</p>

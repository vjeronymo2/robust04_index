			<p>941208 FT  08 DEC 94 / International Company News: Hopewell turns to banks to fund share purchase Hopewell Holdings, the Hong Kong property and construction group controlled by Mr Gordon Wu, has opted for bank finance to buy shares in one of its subsidiaries. Its decision yesterday to turn to two leading banks for loans of about HKDollars 7bn (USDollars 905m) come after it received a lower credit rating than other leading Hong Kong companies. The award of an indicative rating of BBB- from Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation has prompted a review of the company's financial arrangements, and a decision to rely primarily on bank borrowing. However, Hopewell's subsidiary Consolidated Electric Power Asia (Cepa), the main vehicle for the group's power projects, still intends to raise bond market finance. It was floated on the stock exchange as a separate entity last year. Hopewell's indicated rating puts its senior debt only just within the investment grade category, and compares with a single A rating received by Wharf (Holdings). Yesterday's credit from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Hang Seng Bank includes a novel feature giving the two banks options to subscribe for new shares in Hopewell. Hopewell will use the bulk of the loans to pay the final instalments on its partly-paid holding in Cepa. It bought 800m Cepa shares at the time of the power company's flotation, but paid only half the HKDollars 10-a-share price up-front. A further HKDollars 2.50 a share was paid off this week, using the loan proceeds, and the remainder will be paid next December. Cepa plans to issue a bond in the capital markets for which it will seek a credit rating. It will also consider using project bonds to partly finance its power schemes in Asia, notably two current proposals in the Philippines and Indonesia. The options issued by Hopewell in connection with its loan will allow the two banks, both members of the HSBC group, to subscribe an aggregate HKDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 194m) for new shares in Hopewell from the beginning of next year until to December 5 1999. They may only be transferred by the banks to their own holding companies or wholly-owned subsidiaries, and will not be listed on the stock exchange. If the options are fully exercised, Hopewell will issue 182.9m new shares, representing around 4.2 per cent of its existing issued share capital.</p>

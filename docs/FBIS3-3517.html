			<p>Article Type:CSO     [Editorial report] A 15-car train arrived in Shanghai from  the city of Fuyang, in Anhui Province, on 14 February. Onboard  were 2,850 laborers from outside the municipality, signaling the  beginning of the spring labor influx. Of this group, most were  between 20 and 30 years of age, and more than half had never  left their home villages before. Most will stay in Shanghai,  while others will head to Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and  Changshou to seek work. The Shanghai Public Security Department  already has prepared a number of vehicles to transport laborers  to other places outside the city, and the Shanghai police have  strengthened their forces to keep public order.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (YONHAP) -- Ruling party Chairman Kim  Chong-pil warned Monday that pro-Pyongyang elements in the South  have been distributing printed materials praising Kim Il-song's  chuche (self-reliance) ideology and glorifying the North's  planned transfer of power to Kim's son, Chong-il.    Kim Chong-pil, from the ruling Democratic Liberal Party  (DLP), told a meeting of senior party officials that a man who  once served as an ambassador and now works in foreign relations  gave him a small booklet last Saturday which had been sent to  him. Kim later presented the booklet titled "21st Century and  Leader".    "The contents of the booklet praise Kim Il-song's chuche  ideology and stress that Kim Chong-il will play a greater role  as leader (of the North) after assuming power from the great  leader (Kim Il- song)," the DLP chairman said. "In particular,  the phrases and words in the booklet are not ones used by the  northerners but expressions we use here. The style of printing  also seems not to belong to the North."    Accordingly, the booklet must have been printed here and  then  distributed, said Kim, advising the party to take action on the  matter.    Kim criticized the attitude of law enforcement authorities,  saying, "I heard from the man who passed the booklet on to me  that policemen ignored him when he brought the booklet to a  police box. I'm concerned about the police if they take such an  attitude."</p>

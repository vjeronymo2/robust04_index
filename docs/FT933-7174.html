			<p>930824 FT  24 AUG 93 / Yeltsin, Shevardnadze agree pact THE Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, and the Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, agreed yesterday to sign a comprehensive treaty restoring peace in war-torn Abkhazia, agencies reported, Reuter reports from Moscow. Mr Shevardnadze told the Itar-Tass agency that the friendship and co-operation agreement between the two former Soviet republics would be signed in September in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after a final round of talks. 'Both of us have expressed satisfaction with the first steps towards a ceasefire and the terms for a final settlement of the conflict,' the agency quoted Mr Shevardnadze as saying. The two leaders also discussed ways of helping about 140,000 refugees, who fled the breakaway Abkhaz region over the last 12 months, to return home safely, it said. Mr Shevardnadze said repatriation of refugees was 'perhaps the most acute problem' after last month's ceasefire in the conflict. He added that the future Georgian state would be determined by a new constitution. Russia, which has strategic interests in the Transcaucasus, helped to mediate the peace deal between Georgia and Abkhazia.</p>

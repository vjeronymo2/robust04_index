			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cost savings help Cheam rise to Pounds 2.4m Efficiency savings and reduced operating expenses helped Cheam Group, formerly Sutton District Water, to a 16 per cent profit increase for the year to March 31. The pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 2.4m, against Pounds 2.07m for the previous 12 months, struck on turnover up from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 12m. The reported comparable figures for the 15 months to March 31 1991 showed profits of Pounds 2.37m on turnover of Pounds 12.8m. An unchanged final dividend of 4p is proposed, making a 7.5p for the year against the same for the 15 months.</p>

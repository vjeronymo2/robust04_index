With their sitting blockade they unsuccessfully tried until  noon to force permission to enter the country. A press  spokesman of the Federal Border Police in Kleve stated that the  Kurds, who had come from the neighboring countries in busses, do  "not have any right" to enter.    The Kurds obviously wanted to go to Mannheim to participate  in the mourning march for the two young women who had burned  themselves last week out of protest against the oppression of  their people in Turkey.</p>

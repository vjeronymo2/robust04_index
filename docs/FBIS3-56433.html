Working as Russia's  deputy premier, first deputy premier and then acting premier, I  tried to do my best to enable Russia's economy to stand on its  feet as soon as possible, to make it possible for the painful  period of transition to be overcome promptly. Thanks to the  courage and patience of our compatriots, thanks to your resolve  and consistency, we managed to not only avoid social and  economic cataclysms that are shaking many former Soviet  republics, but even pave the way for the future revival of our  country.    "The conditions of our work in the government have never  been  ideal. You are well aware of the fact that we failed to  accomplish much as a result of unceasing pressure on the part of  the conservative political circles, not because of objective  circumstances. Last September, when agreeing to rejoin the  government, I realized that, while being responsible for  economic reforms in the eyes of society, I will have only  limited levers of influence on the economic situation.  Nevertheless I hoped that the realization of our common  responsibility for the country will make it possible for the  government, even if it consisted of people of differing  outlooks, to rally behind the president and follow a policy  aimed at stabilizing the economy and preventing a catastrophe.    Unfortunately, more and more decisions, in preparing which I  took no part, and even categorically objected to, have been  taken of late. I'll make only two examples.    An inter-bank agreement on the unification of monetary  systems has been signed between Russia and Belarus. Such  unification is possible only if it is carefully prepared and if  a mechanism of control protecting Russia's interests is created.  However, the measures envisaged in the agreement will only  reproduce chaos in the monetary sphere at the expense of Russian  citizens' real incomes. The implementation of this decision will  lead to a situation whereby the minimal salary and pension in  Belarus will exceed the minimal salary and pension in Russia.  We are not rich enough to sacrifice the welfare of the Russian  citizens to political considerations. I objected to this  decision, but my protests fell on deaf ears.    Neither is it possible to support the decision to build a  new  parliament center costing about $500 Mn. This sum far exceeds  the resources allocated with great difficulty in 1993 for  military conversion and is five time greater than the federal  spending on culture and art. This sum equals one fifth of last  year's social spending. This destructive decisions was taken  without my knowledge and despite my resolute objections. Given  this, it will be difficult for me to justify the rigid policy of  curtailing expenses on science, culture, education and  environmental protection. True, vitally important reforms  involve inevitable outlays, but they have nothing to do with the  price of thoughtless and hasty decisions.    Esteemed Boris Nikolayevich,    I cannot stay in the government and at once oppose it.  Neither can I be responsible for reforms without having an  opportunity to prevent actions similar to the ones I have  mentioned or levers for implementing an economic policy which I  am sure is correct.    Therefore, to my great regret, I have to turn down the post  of the Russian government's first vice chairman offered to me.  I assure you, however, that I will firmly support You and Your  policy of reforms.</p>

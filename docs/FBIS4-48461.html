			<p>BFN     [Text] The genocide continues at a greater pace than ever.  Putting aside Mr. Theodore Sindikubwabo's pleasure over the  extermination of Tutsis in Kibuye and Cyangugu, government  forces recently threatened that they would massacre those  refugees in the Hotel Des Milles Collines, as well as several  orphans which were taken hostage by government soldiers and  Interahamwe [Republican National Movement for Democracy and  Development militias]. The Interahamwe militiamen and  government troops are ready to massacre all these people if the  Rwandan Patriotic Front continues its military advance.</p>

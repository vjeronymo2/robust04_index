			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL / ROBYN NORWOOD;  </P> <P> BRUNDY TAKES SHOTS AT DEPAUL RECORD BOOK  </P> <P> Stanley Brundy never took to Los Angeles. He didn't like it when he came here  from New Orleans and, after playing at Crenshaw High School for 2 years, he  went to college elsewhere.  </P> <P> His departure has been DePaul's gain. This season, he is leading the Blue  Demons in scoring at 18 points a game, rebounding at 6 a game, field goal  percentage at 65%, blocked shots at 24, and steals at 35.  </P> <P> By coincidence, he had the best game of his career against a Los Angeles  school, scoring 47 points and pulling down 20 rebounds in a 115-111 victory  over Loyola Marymount in the championship game of DePaul's tournament in  December.  </P> <P> It was a performance that put him in good company in DePaul basketball lore.  His scoring total was 6 points shy of George Mikan's school record of 53, set  in 1945, and tied him for second with Mark Aguirre, who scored 47 against Maine  in 1981. The only other DePaul players to have scored 30 points and have taken  down 15 rebounds in a game are Aguirre and Terry Cummings.  </P> <P> Like it or not, Loyola Marymount will see Brundy again today, when the teams  meet at the Rosemont Horizon.  </P> <P> Brundy wasn't the star of the undefeated 1984-85 Crenshaw team that won the  City 4-A championship and the State Division I championship. He averaged 14  points a game on a team that counted among its members Stevie Thompson, now at  Syracuse, and Ron Caldwell and Dion Brown, both now at Washington.  </P> <P> But he has come into his own at DePaul, where he has scored 1,025 points in 95  games and has made a place for himself with the best career field goal  percentage in school history.  </P> <P> His repertoire of dunks, layups and a shot that school publicist Tim Stephens  calls "a running one-hander sort of hook from 3 feet out," has him at 62% for  his career. He is so far ahead of second place, which is 55.3%, that he could  miss his next 88 shots and not lose the record.  </P> <P> His mark is also the highest of any active player and puts him at No. 19 on the  NCAA's all-time list, wedged between Patrick Ewing and Brad Daugherty.  </P> <P> The free throw line is a different matter. Fifteen feet apparently is beyond  his range. Brundy has made just 32 of 74 from the line this season, or 43%.  </P> <P> He is such a disaster at the line that he shoots 100 free throws before  practice, 100 after, thinks about them "day and night," and still gets no  better.  </P> <P> It has been so bad that Coach Joey Meyer, for a time, took to not watching when  Brundy was at the line. But the laughter from bench-warmers who caught on  changed his mind.  </P> <P> That would be good-natured laughter, of course. Brundy is the cornerstone of  the 9-7 team, which has lost 6 games to teams ranked in the top 20.  </P> <P> But we like your nose, Coach K: Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski turned philosophical  this week in responding to a question about the Blue Devils' No. 1 ranking.  </P> <P> "Would you rather not be No. 1?" a reporter asked, perhaps conditioned by Dean  Smith's classic -- and often comic -- complaint about the trauma of holding the  top spot.  </P> <P> "Being ranked No. 1 is fine," Krzyzewski said. "You're like my wife, asking  about all those hypothetical situations. I'd rather deal with the fact that we  are ranked No. 1. That's just where it's at. If we're not No. 1, then I'll deal  with that.  </P> <P> "I have a big nose. But I don't sit around saying, 'I wonder what it would be  like without a big nose. I'd like a little one.' I don't do things like that.  What do you think? Do you think I'd look better with a little nose?"  </P> <P> Duke beat William &amp; Mary this week, 100-38.  </P> <P> Just think if Mary hadn't played.  </P> <P> How to explain the scheduling of a game that proved so lopsided?  </P> <P> William &amp; Mary, a school in Williamsburg, Va., is something of a  traditional opponent and has a 2-23 record against Duke. The Indians are  coached by Chuck Swenson, who began his basketball career as a manager of the  Indiana basketball team under Bob Knight and worked as an assistant to  Krzyzewski at Army for 3 years and at Duke for 7.  </P> <P> Consider the scheduling a friendly gesture by Krzyzewski, providing his friend  with a big-time game that appeals to recruits and gets some exposure for the  program.  </P> <P> The same explanation holds for another Duke blowout this year, a 94-59 win over  Cornell, a team coached by Mike Dement, who was an assistant at Duke in  1982-83.  </P> <P> Larry Steele and the city of Portland have done all right by each other for a  long time.  </P> <P> Steele played for the Trail Blazers for 9 years and helped Portland win a  National Basketball Assn. title in 1977 with his hustle and uncanny outside  shooting.  </P> <P> Now he is at work at a task that is proving more difficult than his days in the  NBA, coaching a University of Portland basketball team that is 0-14 this season  and has a 20-game losing streak, the longest current streak in Division I.  </P> <P> When Jack Avina quit 2 years ago, the Pilots hired Steele after Dave Twardzik,  another former Trail Blazer, turned down the job.  </P> <P> At the time, Steele was marketing manager for the Trail Blazers. He had never  coached.  </P> <P> The Pilots finished 6-22 in his first season. This season, they have played  only one team below the Division I level, Puget Sound.  </P> <P> The Pilots lost to the Division II Loggers, 75-71, after blowing a 13-point  lead in the second half.  </P> <P> "We started hoping we would win," Steele told the Associated Press. "I think  that was the problem."  </P></p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Arts: Satire opts for easy game KIT AND the Widow have brought sporadic hilarity to The Ambassadors with a patchy show by turns sophisticated and infantile. The performance is slick and the material current, but at the moment it only occasionally finds an authentic voice. Musical satire has always been derivative and nostalgic about its own past, and is usually parasitic on contemporary shows; so while the form of Kit and the Widow looks back to Flanders &amp; Swan and to Lehrer, the content looks to Lloyd-Webber and Sondheim. At times the West End jokes at the expense of Bonnie Langford or Stephanie Powers seem pointlessly inward; but the musical wit of 'People Who Like . . . Sondheim' and the steady stream of quotations from classical opera keep the cultural side of the satire alive. However, spots of immaturity threaten to spoil an otherwise wickedly funny evening. The social satire is narrowly class based, wanting in judgment and happy with easy game: the holiday maker on the Costa del Sol, the Bank Holiday picnickers. And the evening becomes increasingly and distractingly encumbered with costumes. In a show which provides such genuine delights as 'My War', a vicious attack on Margaret Thatcher sung with a hint of Lincolnshire patois, it is disappointing to be subjected to a number in which Kit Hesketh-Harvey dons a veil, picked up a violin and played (after Nigel Kennedy) at Rimsky-Korsakov's 'Bumblebee'; why is this supposed to be funny? Hesketh-Harvey and pianist Richard Sisson were most creative when they stepped off the pastiche trail and presented songs which worked by being unexpected: the quiet 'Casablanca' about movie dreamers; or the angry 'Le Cygne' about a swan dying in the flotsam of industrial waste. The show keeps afloat with buoyant if predictable material linked by sharp jokes: 'Ben Elton has sold out in so many ways' or 'Never go back for drinks with a Kennedy.' The evening was never dull, but Hesketh-Harvey is better as a serious lyricist, as he showed with the improving Yusupov in Oxford, written under the aegis and influence of Sondheim.</p>

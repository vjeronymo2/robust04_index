			<p><P> August 19, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN DIES, BLASTS CLOSE INTERSTATE FOR HOURS AS AMMO TRUCK BLOWS UP  </P> <P> A truck carrying 40,000 rounds of ammunition for warplanes went up in flames  and explosions early Friday, killing the driver, injuring her husband and  closing an interstate for hours, authorities said.  </P> <P> The tractor-trailer rig, loaded with 20-millimeter shells for aircraft cannon,  veered off Interstate 17, went into a ditch and caught fire in a remote area  about 30 miles north of Phoenix around 1 a.m., officials said.  </P> <P> "The shells kept exploding; it was like fireworks," said Rock Springs Fire  Chief Pete Davis. "There were shells for about 100 yards on either side. You  couldn't walk without stepping on one."  </P> <P> Although no evacuations were necessary, the sporadic explosions kept  authorities at bay until about 5:30 a.m., Davis said.  </P> <P> The body of the driver, Lois Bailey, 38, of Coleman, Ala., wasn't found for  hours because of the danger, State Department of Public Safety spokesman Allan  Schmidt said.  </P> <P> Her 33-year-old husband, Rick, was in serious condition at a hospital in  Phoenix, a hospital spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The backup on I-17, the major link between Phoenix and Flagstaff, stretched 10  miles and traffic was delayed for hours, Schmidt said.  </P></p>

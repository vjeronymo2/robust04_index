			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / World Bond Markets: Looking to the longer term on Europe - Capital &amp; Credit The US Treasury bond market has provided much of the inspiration for Europe this year. What with three hikes in short-term US interest rates since early February, and the prospect of a fourth in the immediate future, US Treasury bond prices have plummeted, taking the European markets down in their wake. The release on Friday of stronger than expected US employment figures for April, coupled with the recent weakness in the US dollar, means that global bond markets are braced once again for another rise in US interest rates, possibly as early as this week. At the same time, the European government bond markets appear determined to focus on any 'bond-negative' news on the home front, such as signs of a stronger than expected recovery in Germany. While the volatile market conditions this year have made trading in European government bond markets a difficult task on a day-to-day basis, those with a longer time perspective - the economists and fund managers - still cling to the hope that once the bond market shake-out finally shudders to a halt, sensible economic fundamentals will take over once again as the driving force for Europe. Strategy-wise, fund managers claim they are keeping to the core European bond markets of Germany and France, as they see inflation staying low and expect European interest rates to fall further. At the same time, they are studiously avoiding the volatile high-yielders such as Italy and Spain, and prefer to steer clear of the UK economy which is further ahead in the recovery cycle than the rest of Europe. 'People have seen the turn in the interest rate cycle in the US and see it as only a matter of time before that happens in Europe: however, that's too simplistic,' said one European fund manager. 'You have to bear in mind that the dynamics of the situation in Europe are very different from those in the US. In the US, interest rates are rising, and probably should be rising more rapidly than they are, given the inflationary pressures. But Europe is different: the inflation background is improving and even though there is going to be some modest recovery in the European economies, it won't be so strong as to be a worry with respect to inflation.' Mr Nick Henderson, fixed income manager at Gartmore, says he has been increasing the duration of his European government bond portfolio during the turbulent past few months, shifting along the yield curve, for example into the liquid 30-year French and German bonds, as well as into long-dated Ecu issues. 'We have gradually been lengthening our maturity in the global bond markets because continental Europe offers good value. We still see inflation remaining very low, so implied real yields for long-dated bonds are attractive,' says Mr Henderson. Meanwhile, Mr Jonathan Kelly, fixed income manager at Fidelity, sees 'a lot of value in the very short end of European yield curves,' namely in maturities of less than one year. 'Three-month Euro contracts are unduly pessimistic, as they are predicting very high interest rates,' he says, adding: 'It's my opinion interest rates will continue downwards at the short-end in Europe.' While some of the economic data which has come out of Germany recently has sparked nervous selling in the bund market - on the grounds that it suggests the Germany economic recovery is stronger than had been predicted - fund managers and economists are taking a fairly sanguine view. Mr George Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities, says: 'I'm sympathetic to the stronger growth story in Europe, but I also think the market is making a bit too much of it. We are looking at a stronger trajectory for economic growth, but there are important caveats.' He makes the point that German economic growth is 'bond-friendly . . . it's an export-led expansion, with consumer spending and credit expansion playing very limited roles.' Mr Werner Kramer, bond strategist at DB Research, Deutsche Bank's research subsidiary in Frankfurt, says he does not expect stronger growth to affect the outlook for rate cuts in Germany and its neighbours. 'The inflation outlook won't change - if anything, given the dollar's current weakness, the Bundesbank may accelerate its rate cuts to support other central banks in their intervention efforts. At the very least, it will stick to its current pace of easing,' he says 'The market is right in thinking we're getting close to the trough (in interest rates), but it's absolutely mistaken in thinking of interest rates increases' in the near future, says Warburg's Mr Magnus. However, he acknowledges that a lot depends on the direction of the US market: 'If the long bond stabilises around 7 1/4 to 7 1/2 per cent and investors start buying again, Europe will enjoy better times. Whatever the longer-term view, there's going to be a period in the next several months where life will become easier. Maybe the summer months will provide a positive surprise.'</p>

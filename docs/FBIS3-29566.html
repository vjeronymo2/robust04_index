[Central  Committee], the Communist Party of India (Marxist) supporting  the principled stand of the Democratic People's Republic of  Korea for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula.    Indrajit Gupta said the National Council of his party  denounces the United States for bringing the talks between the  DPRK and the U.S. to a rupture and hopes for a final solution  of the nuclear issue through a peaceful negotiation.    The C.C., the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said the  situation created by the U.S. Government clearly shows that the  United States is trying to force the DPRK to accept a  comprehensive inspection, not an inspection of the scope agreed  upon, by using the International Atomic Energy Agency as a  serviceable tool for gathering information on Korea for the  imperialists, and intensify military plots against the DPRK by  gaining time.    A solidarity message supporting the Korean people's cause of  national reunification was also sent to the C.C., the WPK by the  C.C., the Communist Party of Argentina. Expressing militant  solidarity with the WPK, the DPRK Government and people in their  just struggle for the peace and peaceful reunification of the  country, it voiced full support for the Korean people's cause of  defending the banner of socialism and safeguarding the  sovereignty of the country.</p>

			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / Yeltsin ready to match US arms cuts: Russian leader responds with plan to eliminate more than 2,000 nuclear warheads PROSPECTS for early agreement between the US and Russia on eliminating long-range, multi-warhead missiles rose yesterday when a wide-ranging proposal for nuclear arms cuts was unveiled by President Boris Yeltsin. His offer came in response to proposals by President George Bush in his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday, offering substantial cuts in US air, sea and land-based nuclear forces. The two leaders are scheduled to hold talks on Saturday at Camp David, and senior US officials expressed confidence that an agreement could be reached covering multi-warhead missiles, the most dangerous first-strike weapons. The Russian leader called for an international agency to oversee disarmament and said he would bring to Washington proposals for eliminating thousands of warheads from long-range rockets. 'Proposals have been prepared for deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons . . . up to 2,000 to 2,500 warheads on each side,' he said, without specifying which rockets could be eliminated. Mr Bush said in his address to Congress if Russia and the other nuclear-armed former Soviet republics scrapped all land-based multi-warhead ballistic missiles, the US was ready to reciprocate by eliminating the MX Peacekeeper missile, cutting the number of warheads on Minuteman missiles to one, and reducing by a third the number of warheads on submarine-based missiles. The proposed cut in the number of nuclear warheads on Trident submarines is significant since the US has jealously guarded its technological superiority in this area. The US proposals and Mr Yeltsin's offer were widely welcomed in Europe. Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said it was 'a further far-reaching step in building a more peaceful, freer and significantly safer world'. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, praised Mr Yeltsin's response - he is due to meet the Russian leader in London today. Mr Major and Mr Tom King, the UK defence secretary, emphasised that any cuts would not deter Britain from going ahead with plans to deploy new Trident ballistic-missile submarines. In a BBC interview Mr Yeltsin later extended his vision of widespread arms cuts by saying he wanted Russia to become a full-blooded member of the EC and called on the UK, as well as France and China, to join Russia and the US in cutting nuclear arsenals. Mr Yeltsin said he would discuss with Mr Major the possibility of pointing the nuclear weapons of the former Soviet Union away from the UK. Mr Bush had announced unilateral changes in the US strategic nuclear force. He said he would halt production of the troubled B-2 Stealth bomber after completing 20 aircraft, cancel the Midgetman missile, cease production of new warheads for sea-based ballistic missiles and halt purchases of advanced cruise missiles. The US move would scrap more than 2,000 US nuclear warheads and between 4,000 and 5,000 nuclear warheads in former Soviet republics. Disarmament race, Page 7 Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

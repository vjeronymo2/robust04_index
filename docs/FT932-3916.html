			<p>930611 FT  11 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions boost Scapa ACQUISITIONS helped Scapa Group, which supplies industrial textiles and services to the paper industry, increase annual pre-tax profits by 5 per cent from Pounds 44.6m to Pounds 47m. The Blackburn-based group, which makes 66 per cent of its sales outside the UK, yesterday also announced a management succession and an enhanced scrip dividend scheme. Mr Bill Goodall will step down in October after seven years as chairman, on reaching the group retirement age of 62. He will be succeeded as executive chairman by Mr Harry Tuley, 59, the present chief executive. Mr David Dunn who has been finance director since 1987, will become group managing director, and a new finance director will be announced shortly. Turnover rose by 16 per cent to Pounds 347m (Pounds 300m) in the year to March 31. Sterling's devaluation boosted the sales figure by Pounds 5m and profits by Pounds 500,000. Scapa said trading conditions remained difficult for its industrial customers, but the group had managed to increase market share - particularly in engineered fabrics. In engineered rolls, servicing and repair activities had grown at a time when the absence of new paper machines had reduced business available from machine builders. The industrial materials division had shown strong progress, with the start of recovery in the filter fabric business and a good performance from industrial textiles and wirecloth for filter screening and industrial applications. The companies providing technical adhesive tapes had grown substantially, both organically in the UK and by acquisition in Europe. Mr Goodall said: 'The strength of progress now being made endorses further the board's view that the industrial materials division has the capability to play a much weightier part of Scapa's future development.' Earnings rose to 13.8p (13.2p). A final dividend of 4.03p raises the total to 5.63p (5.36p). However, shareholders can elect to take scrip to the value of 6.045p, an increase of 50 per cent over the final cash dividend. For shareholders who want cash, BZW will buy the enhanced scrip at a minimum of 98 per cent of its value, equivalent to 5.924p. The retained cash and related advance corporation tax saving of up to Pounds 11.8m would be used to exploit profitable growth opportunities. Mr Goodall said: 'With any improvements in underlying economic conditions we can expect the group to do well and make faster progress.' COMMENT These were a solid set of results to mark Mr Goodall's departure, and the management succession looks well-planned. Scapa is continuing to find it hard going in the paper industry, but by increasing market share has positioned itself well for any upturn. More interesting is the management's confidence that its investment in filtration and other industrial materials businesses is finally coming good, and offers scope for further acquisitions. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 55m would put the shares, up 2p at 225p, on a prospective multiple of 14.5. That does not seem expensive for a group which last year earned 78 per cent of its profits from the UK and US.</p>

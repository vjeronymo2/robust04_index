			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / ICL top of computing services league ICL, THE computer company in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, is the largest software and computing services organisation in the UK, ahead of EDS-Scicon, the General Motors subsidiary. The Holway Report, an annual review of the financial performance of computing services companies, says ICL's computing services revenue in 1991-92 was Pounds 365m compared with EDS-Scicon's Pounds 255m. The survey shows that computer manufacturers are increasingly turning to software and services to sustain revenues as hardware prices fall. The UK software and services market was worth Pounds 6.1bn in 1991-92 but the rate of annual growth slipped from 6 per cent to 5 per cent. Profits before tax grew strongly, however, in a sector that has suffered badly in the recession over the past two years. They grew an average 44 per cent last year, compared with a 10 per cent fall in the previous year and a 22 per cent fall the year before. The survey says the recovery in profits was due to cost reductions. The 1,100 companies covered by the Holway survey have reduced staff by 9,000, or 7.5 per cent, since the end of 1990. The survey also shows that the top 10 suppliers represented a third of the total UK market and the top 40 represented more than 70 per cent. Revenues of the top 10 companies grew by 19 per cent, almost four times as fast as the average, suggesting continued consolidation. Only three quoted companies in the sector, Admiral, Capita and Macro 4, have not suffered a reversal since 1985. Capita performed best, with an average 65 per cent increase in earnings per share. The 1993 Holway Report. Richard Holway, 18 Great Austins, Farnham, Surrey GU9 8JQ. Pounds 1,450.</p>

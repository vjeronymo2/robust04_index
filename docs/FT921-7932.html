			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: BAe begins the long haul FT-SE Index: 2,536.7 (-19.2) Even after yesterday's figures, it requires considerable faith to believe that the shocks are over at British Aerospace. Certainly, the effort to improve cash-flow, particularly the inventory cutback at Rover, is impressive. But after last year's upset, a still suspicious market will want to double check the annual report for signs of window-dressing to boost the cash position. BAe also has to demonstrate that it can continue to contain its working capital and even squeeze it further. In theory the company should be looking forward to an eventual period of rapidly improving profits as its Airbus investment pays off, its promised defence contracts with Saudi Arabia are finally signed and a turnround in the UK car market produces a steep jump in Rover's margins. But none of these cash-rich prizes are yet secure. Meanwhile, the regional jet market is depressed; the Airbus programme still requires heavy investment spending; and the company has no permanent chairman to shape its long-term future. The shares thus retain an essentially speculative quality in spite of their 31p jump to 303p yesterday. That gives a historic yield of 11 per cent, more than twice the industrial market average. But Sir Graham Day was careful not to commit his successor to any future dividend policy. On past performance BAe seems most comfortable with a dividend cover of about three, requiring earnings of at least 75p. With that still a distant prospect, the payout at best may only be maintained for several years to come.</p>

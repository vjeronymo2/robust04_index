			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / Markets: Bring on the man in the gold lame suit - London Markets Chancellor From: Director General, Oflot Date: December 17, 1994 DEAR Chancellor, Now that I have come to grips with my job as head of the Office of the National Lottery, I would like to offer my services on a wider canvas. As you know, the lottery has been successfully launched, and has achieved its underlying aim. Two years to the day after it was first announced, it is already generating a flood of just-fancy-that stories for the newspapers, usefully distracting attention from the government's problems of rising inflation and higher taxes. I now propose ways of applying Oflot's 'light-touch' regulatory style to other areas of national life. Within a matter of months, it would be possible for my five-person team to achieve major economies by taking over the duties of the Civil Aviation Authority, the Independent Television Commission, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the Department of Health. The techniques developed over the past few years in devising El Normo ('The fat one') are admirably suited to the tasks of allocating 'slots' at airports, licensing television stations, reviewing mergers, reorganising the brewing industry and restructuring London's hospitals. Cost-benefit analysis shows that a televised drawing of lots by a man in a gold lame suit and a woman with a short skirt would achieve far more intellectually coherent decisions than current procedures. The biggest potential gains, however, come in the area of financial markets supervision. If you agree, a simple one-clause bill amending the Financial Services Act of 1986 would abolish the Securities and Investments Board, the London Stock Exchange, Liffe, Fimbra, Imro, Lloyd's Council, the Accounting Standards Board and many other official bodies. In taking over from these institutions, my office would bring new levels of integrity to the supervision of financial markets, assisted by our distinguished US consultant Tony 'Scarface' Gamborelli. I hope you agree. But if you can not make up your mind, please do not set up a committee to decide: toss a coin. * * * The pent-up demand for a national lottery was clearly in evidence on Friday, as fund managers bought millions of pounds worth of tickets for the stock market's soon-to-be-outdated form of tombola. In one of the heaviest days of trading since the surge of activity that followed Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism, the FT-SE 100 index rose 49.4 points, to close at 2,789.7, up 73.5 on the week. There was no obvious trigger, except perhaps some startlingly good interim results from Asda, the food store chain. The new management installed after a boardroom coup last year was able to report pre-tax profits of Pounds 46m, much higher than the Pounds 10m (before exceptional items) recorded for the same period last year and analysts' forecasts of around Pounds 35m. The market clearly took this as a sign that at least one potential recovery stock was in fact recovering. It was one of those cheering moments that are enough to outweigh a week's worth of economic statistics - unemployment, input prices, retail sales, and so on - all still stubbornly refusing to provide the firm evidence of economic recovery that the market now daily anticipates. Interestingly, the Smith New Court/Gallup survey of institutional investors' intensions, published early in the week, suggests that fund managers are in two minds about the outlook. The chart of asset allocation intentions, shown above, indicates that the big increase in appetite for UK equities that followed the ERM exit is now slackening off (and the summer's enthusiasm for gilts is now a fond memory). But institutions' general optimism about the equity market seems to be accelerating: the balance of fund managers who are bullish about the FT-SE 100 index leapt from 27 per cent in November to 42 per cent in December. Economic expectations also improved in the month. That combination of cautious intentions but underlying optimism probably helps to explain Friday's rush of buying. Fund managers, with memories of last year's year-end surge in shares, could be forgiven for deciding that the risks of being stuck in cash over the holiday period, with the year-end portfolio measurement deadline looming, were just too great. The gambling theme pervaded the week, not least in an updated version of one of those Victorian morality tales in which the reprobate plunger finally pays the price for his wild moments at the chemin-de-fer table five years before. On Thursday, Barclays announced the bill for two heady moments in 1987 and 1991 when it staked a total Pounds 440m on lending to Imry, the property developer. It was the steepest price any UK bank has paid for bad lending to a single UK company: a write-off of Pounds 196m and a further provision of Pounds 44m. Barclays shares ended the week unchanged at 378p. The week's real gambling story, the national lottery, largely passed the stock market by - unless you are a shareholder of Zetters, the only one of the big three pools operators that is an independent quoted company. With the national lottery part of the Conservative manifesto, Zetters shares missed the post-election rally and have since slid steadily, closing yesterday at 82p, well down from their January high of 136p. Not surprising, perhaps, when the industry's own trade association is telling the newspapers that both Zetters and Vernons will have to pull out of the business unless the government changes its mind. Well, as they say in Whitehall, alea jacta est.</p>

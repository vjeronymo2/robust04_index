			<p><P> January 25, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WANT TO SELL YOUR UZI? HOLDEN SAYS HE'S READY TO BUY  </P> <P> Transparent campaign stunt or serious gesture to rid Los Angeles streets of a  violent menace?  </P> <P> Serious, says City Councilman Nate Holden, one of 26 possible candidates for  mayor. From excess campaign funds, Holden said Tuesday, he will pay upward of  $300 for every Uzi or AK-47 assault rifle surrendered to police by gang members  or anyone else.  </P> <P> "Better they are in the hands of the Police Department, where they can be  destroyed," Holden said.  </P> <P> The plan as announced was not without flaws. Holden at first urged that people  bring the rifles to his office, but changed his mind when police advised  against anyone carrying weapons into City Hall.  </P> <P> But, though details need to be worked out, Los Angeles police plan to treat the  offer as legitimate.  </P> <P> Cmdr. William Booth, chief spokesman for Chief Daryl F. Gates, said police  don't know if the cash offer will work. But plans are being made in case  weapons are turned in.  </P> <P> More than likely, police will issue a receipt to anyone who turns in such a  weapon, Booth said. What happens next will be a private transaction between  Holden and the former weapon owner, Booth said. Any changes will be explained  today at another Holden news conference.  </P> <P> "We're going to work with him," Booth said.  </P> <P> Aides to Mayor Tom Bradley, however, said the idea is a campaign ploy and  criticized the manner in which the plan was unveiled.  </P> <P> "The plan is poorly thought out," spokeswoman Dee Dee Meyers said. "Where's the  incentive for turning them in?"  </P> <P> Holden made the offer, seemingly off the cuff, at a news conference called to  urge Bradley to agree to debate him before the April 11 mayoral primary.  </P></p>

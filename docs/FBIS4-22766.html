			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Andrey Kobich: "Lawsuits by Vladimir </F> Zhirinovskiy Against the Mass Media: The Deputy Denies His KGB  Connection"]    [Text] Yesterday Deputy of the State Duma Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy filed all at once five lawsuits for protection of  his honor and dignity against various mass media at the  Savelovskiy, Ostankinskiy, and Presnenskiy Courts of Moscow. The  deputy priced the moral damage he suffered at 1.5 billion rubles  [R] (the amounts of the lawsuits range from R100 million to R500  million). Meanwhile, three other lawsuits by the LDPR  [Liberal-Democratic Party of Russia] are already being  considered by the courts. Mr. Zhirinovskiy is demanding  compensation for the moral damage inflicted on him by  unsubstantiated accusations of being a fascist and cooperating  with the state security organs.    According to Mr. Zhirinovskiy's attorney, Sergey Belyak, his  client brought the first lawsuit for protection of honor and  dignity against the POSTFACTUM agency, the newspaper MOSKOVSKAYA  PRAVDA, and former LDPR comrades-in-arms Yevgeniy Smirnov and  Vladimir Bogachev. As early as 1990 they disseminated a leaflet  in which they called Mr. Zhirinovskiy "a KGB secret associate  and adventurer." MOSKOVSKAYA PRAVDA published, quoting  POSTFACTUM, an interview with Mr. Bogachev in which similar  expressions were used. However, in January 1993 proceedings in  the case were postponed indefinitely. Zyuzinskiy Court Judge  Galina Rodina was unable to evaluate the meaning of the words  "seksot" (secret associate) and "adventurer." The records of the  case were submitted to the Institute of the Russian Language for  expert review. In the opinion of Mr. Belyak, rumors about Mr.  Zhirinovskiy being a KGB agent started at that moment. Mr.  Zhirinovskiy has already collected through the courts R20,000  from the STOLITSA magazine and R50,000 from the newspaper  ROSSIYA over such charges.    At present, Mr. Zhirinovskiy is defending his honor and  dignity in two other courts. On 21 March proceedings were  postponed in a case instituted against MOSKOVSKIYE NOVOSTI,  which had accused Mr. Zhirinovskiy of having a KGB connection  since his college years. Sergey Belyak stated that the case may  be resolved amicably if the newspaper publishes a refutation. On  25 March proceedings were postponed in a case instituted against  the newspaper MOSCOW TRIBUNE because of the failure of the  author of the article, Colleen Sanders, to appear. In a report  on his visit to the LDPR, Mr. Sanders stated that there were  people wearing SS uniforms in Zhirinovskiy's entourage who were  "cocking automatic rifles." The attorney maintains that the LDPR  Statute does not call for armed units and fascist symbols.    Yesterday, Mr. Zhirinovskiy filed a lawsuit at Ostankinskiy  Court against the RGTRK [All-Russian State Television and Radio  Broadcasting Company] Ostankino and Oleg Kalugin, who stated in  the documentary "Hawk" shown on the eve of the elections to the  State Duma that Zhirinovskiy was a recruited agent of Soviet  special services. Moral damage to the LDPR leader was evaluated  to be R300 million. Mr. Zhirinovskiy filed two lawsuits in  Savelovskiy Court: against the VIP magazine and Anatoliy Sobchak  (the amount of the lawsuit is R300 million), who believes that  the LDPR "is a typical creature of the KGB," as well as against  the VTRK [All-Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting  Corporation], and Yegor Gaydar, who said in one of the  broadcasts that Zhirinovskiy reminded him of "Hitler in 1929."  Two lawsuits by Mr. Zhirinovskiy were lodged with Presnenskiy  Court. The first is against the TV company NTV [Independent  Television] and Andrey Kozyrev (for R300 million), who  attributed to Mr. Zhirinovskiy the phrase "Russians above all"  and on this basis accused him of being a fascist. The second  lawsuit names the newspaper KURANTY (the amount of this lawsuit  is R100 million), to which Mr. Zhirinovskiy allegedly stated  that "clan and tribal societies" (the Balts, Tajiks, and Uzbeks)  should starve rather than live at the expense of Russians.  Sergey Belyak noted that the General Procuracy has instituted a  criminal case against his client for war propaganda (see  KOMMERSANT, 27 January 1994) on the basis of this publication,  as well as the book "The Final Thrust Southward."</p>

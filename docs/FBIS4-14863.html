			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Aleksandr Vasilyev report: "Peasant's Right To Choose"] </F>   [Text] V. Khlystun, Russian minister of agriculture and  food, held a news conference Thursday [31 March] on the results  of a government presidium session which examined, in addition to  other matters, the draft program for agrarian reform in  1994-1995.    The presidium approved the draft program and instructed  interested ministries and departments to finalize it in due  course and submit it to the Federal Assembly for final  ratification. The program assesses the results of the first  stages of agrarian reform involving the transformation of  property relations with regard to ownership of land and the  means of production and the reorganization of agricultural  enterprises. A considerable proportion of the program is  devoted to the development of a market infrastructure with  wholesale markets, market information, and everything necessary  for a multisectoral agrarian economy. A mechanism is also  envisaged to provide agricultural producers with state support.    An important part of the program is the introduction of a  civilized land market, which will enable the owner of a plot of  land to sell it and a buyer to purchase it. But, the minister  stressed, this cannot totally escape state regulation. Nowhere  in the world is there a land market without certain  restrictions. And Russia has them too.    First: Agricultural land must not be taken out of  agricultural use as a result of a sale and cannot be used for  other purposes. Second: A maximum area is established for a  plot of land that a physical person can privately own. Third:  Agricultural land can be acquired only by a person who has the  ability and opportunity to work the land himself, predominantly  by using his family, and who lives in the given area.</p>

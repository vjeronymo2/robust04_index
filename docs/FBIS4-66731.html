			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Muhammad al-'Ariqi: "Yemeni President Demands </F> That Dialogue Committee Oversee Airports and Ports to Make Sure  Internationally Prohibited Weapons Are Not Imported"]    [Text] Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih has demanded  that the Political Forces Dialogue Committee [PFDC] make the  decision to oversee all airports and seaports in the Republic of  Yemen in order to make sure that there is no importing of  weapons or military equipment and hardware from abroad and in  order to prevent breakdowns in the military situation. He gave  assurances that the General People's Congress [GPC] would adhere  to any decision made concerning this.    During his meeting the day before yesterday with the members  of the PFDC, the Yemeni president denied the news that had been  circulated concerning Yemen's importing internationally  prohibited weapons. He expressed his profound regret concerning  the circulation of rumors such as these, which have no basis in  fact. The president welcomed the decision arrived at by the PFDC  and the Council of Ministers in the meetings recently held in  Aden, and he expressed his hope that the transition to the  application phase would be completed. He demanded that the PFDC  rely upon clarity and frankness when issuing warnings and  reprimands to any party that violates its commitments to execute  these decisions. The Yemeni president also demanded that the  members of the committee not be partial to any party. He called  for the formation of a broad national front in order that no  harm be brought to the country and its unity and in order to  prevent breakdowns or security-related, political, or economic  disturbances. AL-SHARQ has learned that the Yemeni president has  declared his readiness to represent the GPC when dealing with an  investigative committee concerned with the importation of  prohibited weapons. The sources said that the Yemeni president  set next Tuesday, 5 April, as the date for having Salim Salih, a  member of the Presidential Council, come to attend the meeting  of the Presidential Council set by the PFDC. If he does not  attend, then the PFDC will issue a statement to the nation  concerning the matter. The sources said that the Yemeni  president guarantees protection for the leaders of the YSP if  they wish to return to Sanaa, and the matter of security has  prevented them from doing so. In addition to this, the YSP  yesterday announced the return of 10 of its former leading  members who had been removed from the ranks of the party after  the bloody events of January 1986. All of these 10 leaders were  supporters of 'Ali Nasir Muhammad, the former president of South  Yemen.</p>

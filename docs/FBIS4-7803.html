			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Albanian President Sali Berisha by Reis Cico </F> aboard the presidential aircraft returning from Turkey on 6  April-- recorded]    [Text] [Announcer] Albanian President Sali Berisha  returned home today after his official visit to Turkey.    [Cico] Mr. President, what was the aim of your visit to  Turkey?    [Berisha] I visited Turkey at the invitation of President  Demirel. The main goal of my visit was to encourage and  implement the further development of political, economic, and  overall friendly relations between our two countries, as well to  discuss regional problems.    I can say that relations between Albania and Turkey are  proceeding well and developing quickly. These relations are  such because first, there exists a sound and solid foundation  for these relations, based on the powerful blood ties existing  between Albania and Turkey, as well as on historical and  cultural ties. In two years relations at the political level  have assumed new dimensions and developed very well. Similarly,  relations in technology and other fields are developing very  well, quickly, and in a friendly spirit. On the other hand,  economic cooperation and relations leave room for strengthening.    When I say economic cooperation, I should stress here that  over the last two years, Turkey has given Albania considerable  economic assistance, more than 35 million [currency not  specified] in humanitarian and other aid. However, there is a  lot of room for more economic cooperation. Regarding this, I  insisted to both President Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller, as  well as in today's meeting with investors in Istanbul, that  Turkish investment is very welcome and will play a great role in  bringing our two countries together.    [Cico] Mr. President, do you think that the goals of this  visit have been achieved?    [Berisha] I think that they have been completely achieved.  First, I should say that on a political level, the will is  mutual and certain to develop relations further. Both sides are  seeing with pleasure the rapid and harmonious development of  these relations. In the same way, Albania and Turkey have the  same views on the developments in the region. Both countries  are making a real contribution to peace and stability on the  Balkan peninsula.    Economic issues and problems occupied a special place in our  discussions. I particularly insisted that the Turkish  Government, the president, and prime minister encourage Turkish  investment in Albania. There exists a full judicial basis, and  this we improved with the agreement on avoiding double taxation.  That is, there exists a judicial basis between the two  countries on the rapid development of economic relations. I can  say that for Turkish investors, and this point I also stressed  in today's meeting in Istanbul, there are many sectors in which  they can invest and make large profits in Albania. I insisted  on economic ties through investment, because this is precisely  the relations that will weld and increasingly strengthen the  friendship and cooperation between the two countries.    We discussed the East-West corridor, which is a very  powerful  artery in the process of Balkan integration. We also discussed  the possibility, or I insisted on the possibility, of soft  credit on the part of the Turkish Government, so that Albania  will be able to use it to set up its infrastructure.    Prime Minister Ciller and President Demirel promised that  they would study the possibility of finding a mechanism to  create such credit.    We also discussed the expanding and strengthening of air and  naval ties. A new Tirana-Ankara airline will soon go into  operation. They promised me that they would study the rapid  establishment of naval ties. Thus, I think that another horizon  is being opened in economic cooperation between our two  countries, and I am very optimistic that this cooperation will  have a future.    [Cico] Mr. President, do you think that Turkish investment  will come to Albania to the extent that it will reach the level  of political relations, which you stressed are much better than  economic ones?    [Berisha] I hope that Turkish and other investment will come  to Albania. I am optimistic that Albania is becoming an  increasingly attractive country for foreign investors. Albania  offers many advantages: an extremely favorable geographical  position, excellent natural resources, a qualified labor force,  a profitable labor market, and above all legislation based on  freedom for the investor, the freedom of the individual, and the  freedom of free enterprise. I think that all these factors,  taken together with Albanian hospitality, in fact make Albania a  small country geographically, not big from the geographic point  of view, but a country with great chances for investment. I see  with pleasure that this message is being increasingly clearly  understood by Turkish, European, and world business and other  circles.    [Cico] After the meetings that you held with top-level  Turkish officials, it was declared that Albania and Turkey  maintain the same position concerning regional problems. Can  you tell us something more concrete about this?    [Berisha] First, I want to stress that Albania and Turkey  are deeply interested in peace and stability in the region and  have contributed and are contributing in this direction. I can  say that Turkey has made a special contribution to the  reconciliation between the Croats and Muslims. Months ago, the  Turkish Government was engaged in and was one of the first to  support the Washington Agreement on the creation of this  [Bosnia-Herzegovina] federation. In this aspect, I am sure that  the dispatch of Turkish troops to Bosnia will be a further  contribution to the gradual stability of the region.    I would like others to render their own contribution. We  particularly expect the Russians to convince the Serbs to join  the agreement, because the signing of the agreement by the  Serbian side will really be a decisive and very important moment  in establishing peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In our talks, we devoted a special place to the solution of  the Albanian question. Turkey, or I can say in Turkey, the  dimension of this question is very clear. Of course, Albania  and Turkey oppose the changing of borders through violence.  However, I insist that the crisis in the Balkans cannot be  solved without resolving the Kosova problem and without  stability in Macedonia [Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia --  FYROM]. In this aspect, Turkey supports Albania's efforts for a  peaceful solution to this problem, just as as it is interested  in Macedonian stability.    I can say that we had a complete convergence of views and  once again I want to thank my hospitable friends -- President  Demirel and Prime Minister Ciller -- for the very warm and  friendly reception that they extended to us.    [Cico] Thank you.</p>

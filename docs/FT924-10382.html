			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / Finance and the Family: Chasing the base rate / A look at money market funds SAVERS who are reluctant to put their money into either gilts or equities, but want better returns than a high interest building society account, can turn to the money markets. These are markets where banks and other financial institutions lend and borrow money. Rates in these markets are normally very close to base rates which means that funds based on the money markets can offer a very competitive return. There are a number of funds based on the money markets, some of which quote interest rates every day in the second section of the Financial Times. Some building society accounts may occasionally offer higher rates than these funds. But building society savers can be attracted into an account by high rates, only to suffer when rates are suddenly cut to much less appealing levels. A variety of funds offer money market rates: Cash unit trusts Your money buys units in the fund, and the value of the units (and thus your holding) goes up in proportion. There are more than 30 cash unit trusts but not all are targeted at the private investor. For example, Govett MIS Cash, the second largest in terms of fund size, requires a minimum investment of Pounds 100,000 and is used mainly by brokers. The largest cash unit trust, with Pounds 68m under management, is run by Fidelity Investments. Recently renamed the Easy Access Cash Account, Fidelity has aimed the fund at private investors, rebasing the price of units in the fund to Pounds 1, with the unit price remaining a stable Pounds 1. This makes it immediately apparent to investors how much they hold. The minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 and those who keep Pounds 5,000 are issued with a cheque book (cheques must be for a minimum of Pounds 250). On Friday, Fidelity's cash unit trust was yielding 8.8 per cent gross and Morgan Grenfell's cash account, 9 per cent gross, both on a minimum of Pounds 1,000. There are few banks or building societies offering rates as high as this on Pounds 1,000. Both these accounts operate like a postal account, with withdrawal slips, provided and you should receive a cheque within three days of posting the withdrawal slip. Most cash unit trusts carry an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent, which is deducted from the trust's income. The rates quoted above are net of this. The main risk with a cash unit trust is that your money could be invested in a bank or financial institution that collapses. However, fund managers screen banks carefully, and spread their investments between the banks. Investors with cash unit trusts are protected by the investor's compensation scheme. Trust Funds If you do not like the idea of buying units, a money market trust fund operates almost identically to a bank account by holding your money in cash. There are only a small number of trust funds and most deal at the wholesale end of the market, that is with companies and charities. Gartmore (which also manages a cash unit trust), offers a number of funds, including a call fund and a seven-day fund. The minimum deposit is Pounds 5,000 and the interest rate being paid on the call fund on Wednesday was 8.98 per cent gross and 8.55 per cent gross on the seven-day account. You can withdraw money by telephoning Gartmore which will transfer the money either electronically, or if the amount requested is under Pounds 1,000, by cheque. As its name suggests, the call fund allows instant access to your money. Anthony Myers, managing director of Gartmore, says that there are no charges on the account because it is cheaper to run than a conventional bank account. These funds are covered by the Deposit Protection Scheme, which will refund 75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000, that is, a maximum of Pounds 15,000. Bank Accounts The Big Four clearing banks - Barclays, Lloyds, National Westminster and Midland - all offer money market accounts. Money can be deposited at a fixed rate for a specific term. The interest rate is fixed but since these are money market funds, the fixed rate you are offered will vary on a daily basis. The maximum deposit is usually Pounds 250,000. Rates quoted below are all gross. If you have a minimum of Pounds 5,000 at Midland, you could have deposited this on Thursday for six months at a fixed rate of 6.25 per cent or for one year at 5.94 per cent. You would have needed a minimum of Pounds 10,000 for a seven-day notice period fixed at 7.19 per cent gross, while with Pounds 25,000 you could have locked into a one month fixed rate of 7.31 per cent gross or 6.13 per cent for five months. Lloyds, which requires a minimum deposit of Pounds 10,000, was offering 6.12 per cent fixed for one month, 5.87 for three months and 5.37 for six months. Rates for the same fixed periods on Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 49,999 were 6.5 per cent, 6.25 per cent and 5.75 per cent. Barclays operates its main money market accounts offshore through Barclays Bank Finance Company in Jersey. Fixed term deposits are for periods of one, three, six and 12 months. The minimum is Pounds 5,000. On Thursday you would have been offered a fixed-term interest rate of 6.13 per cent for one month, 5.5 per cent for three months and 4.69 per cent for one year. Rates are higher on larger sums, for example, deposits of Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 49,999 were attracting interest of 7 per cent for one month and 6.38 for three months. The lower fixed term rates on longer term deposits are a reflection of the banks' expectations that base rates are to fall further.</p>

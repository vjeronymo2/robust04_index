			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Reactions against and criticism of the "Ichi-Ichi  duo" -- Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] General Secretary Ichiro  Ozawa and Komeito [Clean Government Party] General Secretary  Yuichi Ichikawa -- quickly poured out of the ruling coalition  parties on 3 February. The duo is known to have collaborated  with the Finance Ministry in pushing for the raising of the  [current consumption] tax. After the Social Democratic Party of  Japan [SDPJ] announced its objection to the tax increase, saying  it is even willing to quit the coalition government, voices  urging a "holding off" [on the tax increase] were raised by the  Democratic Socialist Party [DSP], the Sakigake [Harbinger]-Japan  New Party [JNP] alliance, which is the prime minister's own  camp; and even the ruling party's two powerhouses -- Shinseito  and Komeito.    They complained that "the issue of raising taxes, about  which  the voters are most sensitive, has been handled too  thoughtlessly," but their complaint may be said to be an  eruption of discontent about Ozawa and Ichikawa's practice of  holding "consultations behind closed doors." It is probable  that this sentiment will have a delicate impact on future  discussions concerning the reorganization of the [Japanese]  political world.    On that day, the SDPJ was high-spiritedly ready to "fight it  out," with one senior party official declaring, "Ozawa and  Ichikawa are making light of the people." One Diet member of  the party spat out: "We have been made a fool of so often in the  past. This time we will fight back tooth and nail." The SDPJ  has had to make concessions to keep the coalition in power --  first on the question of the partial opening of the rice market  and then on political reform issues. It can be said that their  resentment, which has accumulated, is erupting altogether. Even  a right-wing member of the party said emphatically: "Maybe they  forced it on us, thinking that we will leave the coalition. If  so, we can get together with Sakigake and the DSP."    At an informal meeting of the two houses' members of the  Sakigake-JNP alliance, [Sakigake] General Secretary Hiroyuki  Sonoda had a difficult time explaining what had happened and  claimed, "It was impossible for me alone to present an objection  at the meeting of the representatives." But those present at  the meeting complained bitterly, saying: "The masters of the  government we formed are supposed to be the people. How will  you explain this to the people?" or "Do you want to cheat the  people in order to shake hands with the Liberal Democratic  Party?"    Within the DSP, General Secretary Takashi Yonezawa, who had  earlier agreed together with people like Ozawa at the ruling  party representatives' meeting to the proposal on raising the  tax, has reversed his position completely and asked the prime  minister by telephone to reconsider the matter, after party  Chairman Keigo Ouchi (health and welfare minister) and Akira  Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation,  voiced their complaints about the increase.    In Komeito, which normally is proud of its unity, there were  voices of complaint heard in a general meeting held on 2  February. One said, "The party had said it would agree with the  views of Chief Cabinet Secretary Takemura in going ahead with  tax cuts without tying this to increasing the tax. Why was the  tax increase included in the bill?" Another said, "Is it all  right not to hold formal discussions on the problem of the  unfair tax system?" With General Secretary Ichikawa being  absent from the event so that he could participate in a party  representatives' meeting, Komeito members' criticisms and doubts  were conspicuous. Party Diet members whispered to each other,  "This is a reckless run by the Ichi-Ichi duo while riding on the  back of the Finance Ministry's horse."    Even in Shinseito, which entrusted Ozawa with decisionmaking  on the previous day, voices saying "We should uphold the  coalition by presenting some kind of concession to the SDPJ"  were heard one after another at the party staff meeting around  noon. Now that there are emerging moves even within these two  parties -- Shinseito and Komeito -- to reconsider the concept of  handling the tax cuts and the tax increase in a package, it has  become very clear that objections to the bill within the ruling  camp are quite strong.</p>

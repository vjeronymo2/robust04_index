			<p>930729 FT  29 JUL 93 / Government 'vindicated' over Swans bid THE NATIONAL Audit Office report into the bids for a helicopter carrier order, which left Tyneside shipbuilder Swan Hunter facing closure, vindicates the government's decision to award the contract to the rival bidder, Mr Neville Trotter, Tory MP for Tynemouth, claimed yesterday. According to Mr Trotter, the report from the government's spending watchdog, to be made public today, says the main factor in the award was price. Both bids were assessed by the Ministry of Defence as technically acceptable and with the same overall level of risk. According to the report, said Mr Trotter: 'The advice given to the ministers on both technical and commercial aspects was correct.' The report, he said, confirms that at the final stage, Swan Hunter bid Pounds 210m while its rival, a consortium of Cumbria-based VSEL and the Kvaerner Govan merchant shipyard on the Clyde, bid Pounds 139m - Pounds 71m less. It also says technical consultants appointed by the NAO had concluded that assessment of the offers was thorough and that both bids were treated fairly. This apparently contradicts claims from Swan Hunter campaigners that the MoD's final bidding process was biased against the company. But, according to the disclosures, the report does confirm claims that VSEL in effect subsidised its bid. Mr Trotter said the report states: 'VSEL opted to take the risk of supporting their bid significantly from the company's resources.' He added that it says that VSEL did not want its bid figure made public. The report is the result of an inquiry launched after Swan Hunter went into receivership in mid-May, two days after losing the order. According to Mr Trotter, the report also refutes claims that the bidders were offering different ships - 'a Rolls-Royce or a Lada', as one Swans campaigner put it. It says the consortium vessel is a warship built to appropriate standards, which it describes as 'a cost-effective solution without prejudicing personnel safety, financial requirements or quality'. Mr Trotter said the report discloses that Swans increased its bid price at the final stage by Pounds 36m, including Pounds 12m for extra overheads, at the suggestion of GEC, then negotiating to take over the company. Tyneside Labour MPs Mr Steve Byers and Mr Nick Brown yesterday met senior management of Bremer Vulkan, the German shipbuilding and general engineering group which was one of companies considering whether to bid for Swans. As part of the campaign to retain shipbuilding on the Tyne, union leaders met Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, to discuss the prospects of Swan Hunter securing European intervention funding subsidy. Mr Trotter was meeting European Commission officials in Brussels last night for talks on prospects for Swan Hunter.</p>

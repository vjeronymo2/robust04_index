			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> KABUL CARRIES ON;  </P> <P> LUCK IS YOUR CO-PILOT ON THIS AIRLINE  </P> <P> At 24,000 feet, Ariana Airlines Flight 455 to Herat was somewhere over  Afghanistan's war-torn Bamiyan province last week when Ariana employee  Bismillah very casually mentioned the enemy anti-aircraft base located directly  below.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, he told his first American passenger in years, U.S.-backed  moujahedeen rebels fired an American-supplied Stinger missile at his civilian  airliner.  </P> <P> "Not to worry," the cheery Bismillah shouted over the drone of the Soviet-made  Antonov-26 turboprop. "It missed."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Crash in Iran  </P> <P> But one anecdote led to another, and Bismillah, who works as a flight  dispatcher, quickly moved on to the story of a hijacking in August:  </P> <P> The co-pilot of another Ariana domestic flight, it seems, pulled a gun on his  best friend, the pilot, and tried to force him to land in neighboring Iran,  where the co-pilot planned to defect to the Muslim rebels. A gun battle ensued  in the cockpit, and the plane crashed in Iran, killing six.  </P> <P> "And that's why, you see, Ariana Airlines is now down to just five domestic  aircraft," Bismillah lamented with a sigh. "You see what it is like trying to  run an airline during this war? You see what this war has done to all of us?"  </P> <P> Indeed, after a decade of war, the Afghan government's domestic airline,  complete with its battered planes, neurotic air crews and nonexistent  schedules, is a typical example of President Najibullah's effort to maintain a  semblance of government in a nation of ruins.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Destroyed on Ground  </P> <P> Despite rebel anti-aircraft emplacements, rocket attacks that have destroyed  planes on runways and a budget that allows wages of just $14 a month to  employees such as Bismillah, who risk their lives daily, Najibullah has  insisted that Ariana's domestic show must go on.  </P> <P> The handful of European and East Bloc diplomatic observers who remain in Kabul,  the capital, say such issues are key symbols of survival for Najibullah's  beleaguered, pro-Soviet government.  </P> <P> The regime has steadfastly defied Western predictions that it would fall within  weeks of the Soviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan last February. The troops  had been supporting the Afghan government against the rebels.  </P> <P> But, as a Times reporter learned firsthand during a recent visit to  Afghanistan, there are prices to pay for such symbolic shows of strength. In  the case of Ariana Airlines, the exercise clearly has produced the strangest  commercial airline on earth.  </P> <P> Ariana's passengers, for example, never have to worry about the airline losing  their check-in baggage. They sit on it during the flight. There is no "Fasten  Seat Belt" sign -- because there are no seat belts. As for "No Smoking"  sections, forget it. The ground-maintenance crews puff away on Russian  cigarettes even while they refill the wing tanks.  </P> <P> And Ariana Flight 455 from Kabul to the extreme western city of Herat was  typical.  </P> <P> It began in a bombed-out storage shed that Ariana calls its domestic departure  lounge in Kabul. None of the employees on hand had the faintest idea what time  the plane would depart. They didn't know whether Flight 455 would stop  somewhere en route to Herat. In fact, they weren't even all that sure there  would even be a Flight 455 that day.  </P> <P> "How can we make schedules?" a grim-faced Bismillah later said. "We never  really know exactly where our planes are going to land even after they take  off."  </P> <P> With boarding passes -- tiny, blank pieces of cardboard -- in hand, passengers  were then led to a battered bus outside the shed. The bus windows were sealed  shut, but air circulated well through the dozens of shrapnel holes torn into  the bus's sides from the weekly rebel rocket attacks on Kabul's only airport.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Stand Up During Takeoff  </P> <P> Soon, it was announced that Flight 455 would indeed depart, and the plane was  quickly packed solid with sacks and bags and passengers, some of them forced to  stand even during takeoff.  </P> <P> Space on Ariana's few daily flights is coveted, to say the least. After 10  years of war, most of Afghanistan's roads are largely impassable. What Soviet  aerial bombardments haven't destroyed, rebel artillery attacks have. Then,  there are the added travel risks of kidnaping and robbery by armed bandits and  tribal fighters from both warring sides along the roadway.  </P> <P> But there were other glimpses of the war on board the plane.  </P> <P> The vast array of baggage, for example, underscored the strangeness and the  brutality of Afghanistan's unending conflict. It ranged from giant tambourines  and peacock feathers to artificial limbs and a coffin.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extreme Isolation  </P> <P> And the extreme isolation of Afghanistan -- 10 years after Najibullah's ruling  party appealed to their Soviet backers and received 115,000 Red Army troops --  also was obvious during a brief conversation on board between a Westerner and a  young Afghan engineer.  </P> <P> "Where are you from?" the wide-eyed engineer asked after hearing the Westerner  speak to a colleague in English.  </P> <P> "America," came the reply.  </P> <P> "My God," the engineer shrieked. "I am so happy. You are the first Americans I  have seen in 10 years. When I was in Kabul University in 1978, all of my  teachers were Americans. I remember Miss Cooper from Texas. There was another  one from Chicago.  </P> <P> "But, why are you on this plane? Why are you going to Herat? There is nothing  in Herat but more war."  </P> <P> The war also was discussed in the cockpit, where, as is standard practice, the  pilot was an air force colonel and the co-pilot a civilian, a precaution  against hijacking and defection.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ill-Fated Flight  </P> <P> The practice almost worked two months ago on the ill-fated Ariana domestic  flight to Zaranj, in the extreme southwestern corner of Afghanistan a few miles  from the Iranian border.  </P> <P> For most of the flight, the defecting co-pilot, whom several sources said was  the son of Afghanistan's former prime minister Hassan Sharq, tried to persuade  the pilot to join him.  </P> <P> It was only after the co-pilot pulled a gun, forcibly took control of the plane  and crossed the Iranian border that the pilot fought back, grabbing the pistol  and wounding the co-pilot. But it was too late to return to Afghanistan, and  the plane crash-landed in Iranian territory, where all the survivors, and the  wreckage, remain to this day.  </P> <P> "Imagine," Bismillah mused, as Flight 455 slowly crossed over the desolate,  lunar Afghan countryside, "our own co-pilot hijacking the plane. You see what  it has come to here, what happens when brother fights brother and best friend  fights best friend. Where it will go, only God knows."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Symbol of Hope  </P> <P> But Bismillah is one of Afghanistan's many symbols of hope.  </P> <P> Like most Ariana employees, the flight dispatcher also accompanies  international Ariana flights to Frankfurt, West Germany; Dubai, in the Persian  Gulf; Prague, Czechoslovakia, and New Delhi. He has had many chances to defect  or simply walk away. And he has had many good reasons to do so.  </P> <P> Trained by American advisers decades ago, the 28-year veteran Ariana employee  would make 100 times his salary outside Afghanistan. During his night stops in  foreign countries, Ariana gives him less than $20 a day for hotel, meals and  taxis. And, as he noted, "in most countries, people don't try to shoot down  your airplanes."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Resists Temptation  </P> <P> But Bismillah has resisted temptation. In fact, he has forbidden all eight of  his children to join the 5 million refugees who have fled Afghanistan. And,  Bismillah said, none of the reasons for his resoluteness are political.  </P> <P> "I don't like politics. . . ," he said, adding, "In the last 10 years, I have  seen for the first time with my own eyes the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia,  Romania, Germany, India and Dubai. So many places. And, in any one of those  countries, I could make so much more money.  </P> <P> "But I do not go. Those places are not my home. And it is better to stay in  your own country. Everyone must do what little they can to keep our country  alive. Yes, that is much better."  </P> <P> Suddenly, the Antonov-26 lurched downward. Bismillah glanced around sharply to  make sure it hadn't been hit. It hadn't; it had simply encountered an air  pocket.  </P></p>

The vehicle,  license plate 34 PKU 20, was taken to the guardpost in Guzelsu  for a more thorough search. The officials discovered 5 kg of  heroin and a Colt handgun under the seats and another 25 kg of  heroin in secret compartments. The driver, Zeki Gunes, revealed  that the vehicle and the narcotics belonged to an Iranian, Riza  Shahpuri, and that the car and the narcotics were delivered to  him on Turkey's border with Iran.    Gunes said he was to drive the car and deliver it to  Shahpuri  in Istanbul. He said German marks are used to buy and sell  heroin in east Turkey, adding: "We would buy each kilogram for  11,000 German marks and sell it for 17,000 German marks in  Istanbul."    The impounded heroin has a market value of 50 billion  Turkish  lira. The drugs belong to the Kurdish Workers Party [PKK] to  which the profit was to be transferred.</p>

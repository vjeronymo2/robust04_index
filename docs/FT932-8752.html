			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Peru's rebels step up violence for strike PERUVIANS struggled to work yesterday as many public transport drivers stayed off the streets in an 'armed strike' called by Maoist Shining Path rebels to mark the 13th anniversary of the start of their war on the state, AP reports from Lima. The rebels stepped up their campaign of violence in advance of the strike. On Sunday the rebels bombed a bank and a bridge on the third day of an offensive that has killed seven people and wounded eight. President Alberto Fujimori urged Peruvians to ignore the strike and promised the armed forces would tighten security in the capital. The offensive was apparently aimed at intimidating Peruvians into staying at home during the armed strike, ending tomorrow. During armed strikes, the rebels ban transport and commercial activity and kill those who disobey.</p>

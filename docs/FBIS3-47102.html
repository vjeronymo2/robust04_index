			<p>Language: <F P=105> Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A government official has disclosed that the heads  of the royal government of the Kingdom of Cambodia [KOC], Prince  Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh, first prime minister; and Hun Sen,  KOC second prime minister; and a number of ministers, state  secretaries, under state secretaries, and leading officials will  pay an official visit to the PRC from 17 January.    This trip by the two heads of the royal government of  Cambodia [RGC] is made at the invitation of His Excellency  [H.E.] Li Peng, PRC prime minister. It is also their first  joint visit since the official establishment of the royal  government on 29 September 1993.    It ought to be specified that during this trip to China, the  two RGC heads will probably inform King Norodom Sihanouk, who is  receiving medical treatment in Beijing, of the royal  government's major plans, projects, and principles for 1994.    Political analysts on the Cambodia issue have affirmed that  during this visit to Beijing by the two RGC heads -- made after  the attack by Khmer Rouge troops on Romchang village in the  liberated zone of FUNCINPEC [National United Front for an  Independent, Neutral, Peaceful, and Cooperative Cambodia] on 1  January -- discussion and consultation with the king will  probably be held concerning the Khmer Rouge, who also want a  role in the royal government, because China in the past was a  major supporter of the Khmer Rouge.</p>

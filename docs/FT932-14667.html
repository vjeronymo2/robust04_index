			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / UK Company News: Dublin nets IPounds 104m in sale of Irish Life shares THE IRISH government has disposed of just over half of its remaining 33.6 per cent stake in Irish Life, the largest fund manager in the Irish Republic, for a total of IPounds 104m. The 55m shares were sold at IPounds 1.90 a share, to 'a large number of institutional investors, both domestic and foreign' according to the finance department. Two thirds went to Irish investors. Market analysts said the government chose a good moment to sell. The price realised represented only a 5 per cent discount on the last traded price. Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, said at the time of the budget last January, that the government intended to raise some IPounds 150m this year by selling off part of its remnant shareholdings in the former state-run companies Greencore and Irish Life, which were both privatised in 1991. The hangover of the government shareholding has tended to depress the price of both stocks. Irish Life said it was pleased at the broadening of its shareholder base and particularly encouraged by the overseas interest in Irish Life stock. Government efforts to sell its 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, a sugar, milling and malting concern, have not progressed so smoothly, however. Interest has been shown by ADM, the US food conglomerate, but fears over losing control of the Irish sugar quota to a foreign company have fuelled political opposition to the sale, forcing the government last month to open the sale to tender with the intention of encouraging a bid by Irish food companies. None came forward however, and ADM is now playing hard-to-get, presumably with a view to beating the government down on an earlier offer of IPounds 2.60 a share.</p>

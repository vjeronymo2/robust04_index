			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / Tec launches fund for venture capital: Pounds 5m will be available for equity stakes in companies THE Northumberland Training and Enterprise Council yesterday became the first Tec to set up its own venture capital fund, allowing it to make equity investments in companies in its area. The Pounds 5m Oak Fund is part of a package of services launched by the Tec yesterday to stimulate enterprise in Northumberland. The package includes a Pounds 300,000 loan fund, the Rowan Fund, jointly financed by the Tec and Midland Bank, offering unsecured loans of up to Pounds 20,000 with interest pegged at half base rate for new businesses and base rate for existing companies. Northumberland Tec chief executive Mr Stephen Cowell said he believed the enterprise and training remits of Tecs, the 82 employer-led bodies which deliver government training schemes in England and Wales, were of equal value and went hand in hand. Tecs, he told an audience of Northumberland business leaders, are not 'eggtimers' through which government grants pass, but enterprising bodies which should recognise the need to take risks. The venture capital fund, he said after the launch, did not duplicate resources available from the private sector but was a response to complaints from Northumberland companies about the difficulty of securing equity finance below Pounds 250,000. Mr Cowell said: 'The enterprise strategy was set up to create a whole series of products outside our contract with the government. We're seeking to put our resources together with existing providers so that they might be willing to take risks they wouldn't otherwise have done.' Outside consultants will guide the Oak Fund's investment decisions. It aims to take a stake, typically of about Pounds 100,000, in viable businesses for five to seven years. Other elements of the Tec package are the Cedar Fund, a Pounds 300,000 fund jointly financed by British Coal Enterprise, offering loans of up to Pounds 50,000 at 9 per cent fixed interest, and a Training Investment Fund, through which the Tec will offer companies interest-free loans of up to Pounds 20,000 for high-quality training. Northumberland Tec is already involved in a Pounds 10m scheme to convert Longhirst, a country mansion, into a conference centre and a campus for the University of Northumbria.</p>

The year  1994 must become "a year of consolidation" for the Wiesbaden  police authority, BKA President Hans-Ludwig Zachert said in an  interview with DIE WELT, formulating the strategic targets for  the next few months. "The view is directed forward."    Zachert is firmly convinced that the planned new  organization  of the BKA's command structure, including the trimming of the  department echelons, will have a positive effect. On the basis  of this restructuring, the president is to get three main  departmental heads as a leading team at his side. The current  12 departments are being reduced to nine so that one main  departmental head always heads three sections.    In this connection, the BKA chief categorically rejects the  impression that these organizational changes are effectively  aimed at "depriving" the president "of power." Such claims in  public are completely unfounded. After talks with FRG Interior  Minister Manfred Kanther it is clear: "The BKA president  retains his full power of direction. The ultimate  responsibility rests exclusively with him. And anyone who has  this responsibility also has the final say; this was also  stressed by Minister Kanther in this way."    According to Zachert, the BKA's internal consolidation phase  must be supplemented by having the federal authorities "move  closer toward each other." This is particularly necessary  regarding the Federal Intelligence Office. Here there will have  to be far more intensive forms of cooperation on a new legal  basis, in particular in the fields of combating drug trafficking  and international terrorism.    As a "very personal concern" Zachert cited the further  expansion of the "traditionally good relationship" with the  chief federal prosecutor. The first contacts with the new chief  federal prosecutor, Kay Nehm, in Karlsruhe were "extremely  positive." Zachert and Nehm have known each other for years.    In Zachert's view, the necessary consolidation in the BKA  also includes efforts in investigations against left-wing  terrorism that "are not just intensified when there have been  attacks." Much rather, it is necessary to act anticyclically,  showing intensified vigilance in particular when there have not  been any attacks for a long time.    Furthermore, Zachert thinks it is a "signal" that the  Antiterrorism Department, which has so far been located in  Wiesbaden, will be transferred to the state protection authority  in Meckenheim. The BKA chief hopes that this will lead to an  increase in the efficiency of work and a more flexible use of  personnel. In the parent office in Wiesbaden the free  capacities will be used for intensifying the fight against  organized crime, the highest-ranking German policeman announced.    Zachert said that it is "deplorable" for the intended  consolidation period of his authority that the new BKA law can  obviously not be passed by the end of this legislative period.  Therefore, new regulations concerning preliminary  investigations, the protection of witnesses, and the  internationally organized fight against terrorism unfortunately  cannot yet develop the hoped-for "positive feedback effects on  the new organization."</p>

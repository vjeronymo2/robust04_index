On December 2, 1992, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment (Committal SIP) to adopt an I/M program to meet the requirement of the Act and the I/M rule by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of USEPA's I/M regulations and includes an implementation schedule. On September 9, 1993, USEPA proposed to disapprove this SIP revision and on November 29, 1993, USEPA disapproved this SIP revision based on the failure by the State to meet milestones contained in the committal SIP's implementation schedule pertaining to the enactment of necessary legislative authority. A full SIP revision including State legislative authority to implement the program was required by November 15, 1993. The Indiana legislature adjourned on June 30, 1993, without taking necessary action to provide for implementation of an enhanced I/M program. On December 30, 1993, USEPA Region 5 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit the SIP revision required under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either the requirements of the Act or its commitment to adopt and implement an enhanced I/M program as promised in its committal SIP, USEPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation sanction and a 2 for 1 growth offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review provisions of the Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments on this proposed action are to be submitted by March 15, 1994.

			<p><P> March 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AN EXERCISE IN LEAPING TO CONCLUSIONS  </P> <P> "It has been erroneously reported," the newspaper correction advised, "that Ed  Hotaling, the TV reporter who did the infamous interview with Jimmy (the Greek)  Snyder . . . is black." Other major newspapers had made the same mistake, but  few bothered to correct it. Indeed, the error had a vast audience, thereby  giving the interviewer -- me -- the instructive privilege of being black for  most of 1988 and into 1989.  </P> <P> I got to be a superstar, almost, launched by an editorial in the Philadelphia  Inquirer. It noted that the Greek, then a commentator for CBS Sports, had said  those now-famous silly things -- for instance, that blacks had been bred during  slavery and thus were better athletes today -- to a black television reporter.  The editorial writer pointed out that the network's white brass was "far more  outraged than Messrs. Cosby or Jackson or, for that matter, Ed Hotaling, who  conducted the interview."  </P> <P> Some odd things happened after that. People started talking funny.  </P> <P> When the interview made the network newscasts, calls came from around the  country. A white editor on a great newspaper kept complimenting me. His lavish  words were echoed by a white reporter for another big paper. They both said  that I had been "verrry calm, verrry level-headed, verrry professional  throughout the whooole thing."  </P> <P> What, I wondered, was going on? Why were they talking as if I were 12? Did they  think I was interning with "Children's Express"?  </P> <P> That was before I knew I was black.  </P> <P> "Oh, we get that all the time," one black TV anchor explained.  </P> <P> Whites sometimes do talk differently to blacks. If you're white, you know that,  but have you felt it? This particular mix-up reminded a black commentator that  when she was first hired as a reporter, the white news director sat her down  and said, "Remember, you have to be a reporter first . . . and a black person  second." She was nearly speechless. You can imagine managers saying that, but  not to a white.  </P> <P> Whites rushed to praise me. An Arizona caller said it was wonderful that, in  spite of what the Greek had said, I had been so tolerant, defending his right  to free speech. I told the caller that I was white. The conversation pretty  much ended there.  </P> <P> Why did people assume that a black reporter's reaction would be racial? A  number of blacks told me they thought the Greek should have been fired; a  number disagreed. But many whites took it for granted that black reaction would  be uniformly hostile and unforgiving. Exceptions brought sighs of relief,  cross-country bouquets and, in the case of Messrs. Cosby and Jackson, banner  headlines in New York City.  </P> <P> Occasionally, my new role was uncomfortable. A writer for a monthly magazine  phoned long after the interview and wondered, apologetically, if I were black.  I hated to stonewall a fellow reporter, but now it seemed irrelevant. I told  him I didn't care to say. He apologized again. It felt right, but rotten.  </P> <P> Why did they assume that the interviewer was black? The apparent answer is  simple and sad. I'd run into Jimmy the Greek while I was working on a Martin  Luther King Day story, asking people about the decline of civil rights as an  issue. These days, I learned, if you're interested in civil rights, you must be  black.  </P> <P> Thus, when a paper in Upstate New York got the UPI text of the interview, which  began with the question, "Do you think there's anything we still need to do, or  do you think we don't need to worry about civil rights anymore?" an editor  inserted "blacks" in parentheses after "we." Who else would ask that?  </P> <P> Sadly, almost nobody. Not only do many Americans today see civil rights as a  minority interest, they also remember King as a special-interest advocate.  </P> <P> Two decades after King's death, his opponents live in the woodwork. The day the  Greek lost his job for saying something stupid, a Pennsylvania disc jockey lost  his by announcing King Day in racist terms.  </P> <P> But it is not only in the gutter that many recall King exclusively as a black  leader, the way many conclude that only a black reporter would be assigned to a  civil-rights story. At a Washington dinner of veteran journalists, all white, I  remarked that I was surprised so many people still view King strictly as a  black hero. Hundreds of thousands of whites had supported him; Europeans had  given him the Nobel Prize.  </P> <P> They looked at each other, a little startled. It was clear I was the one out of  step.  </P> <P> "But that's what he was," some brilliant somebody said, as the others nodded in  agreement, "a black leader."  </P> <P> It was good to feel black again.  </P></p>

			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Pakistan cracks down on Kashmir militants KASHMIRI militants said Pakistani security forces killed up to 12 people and arrested their leader together with 100 supporters in an attempt to block their march to the Indian border yesterday, reports Reuter from Chinari, Pakistan. But Mr Sardar Abdul Qayyum, prime minister of Pakistan-ruled Azad Kashmir, denied that Mr Amanullah Khan, leader of the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF), had been arrested and said that there had been many fewer deaths. The JKLF said that their leader and close aides were snatched by the security forces after being separated from other activists who had fought their way close to the border in an attempt to cross it in support of a Moslem uprising in the Indian-ruled side of Kashmir. Mr Qayyum also said the militants had agreed to disband the march in return for the release of 40 people arrested earlier. The JKLF claimed that Mr Khan and 300 of his most ardent supporters had reached the border village of Chakothi after breaking through a police barrier 6km from the ceasefire line. Militants said police occupying the heights above a road sandwiched between the mountainside and the Jhelum river gorge threw rocks down on demonstrators, injuring many. Doctors said police shot dead at least three people. In India, authorities said Indian soldiers fired at other militants trying to cross the disputed border, reports AP.</p>

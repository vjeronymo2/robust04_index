			<p><P> August 24, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HAWTHORNE INCREASES FEES, AVOIDS 32 WORKER LAYOFFS  </P> <P> Averting as many as 32 layoffs, the Hawthorne City Council has increased  numerous municipal fees to offset a $2.5-million deficit in the city's 1989-90  budget.  </P> <P> The increases will raise nearly $800,000 and will help the city achieve a  $44.6-million balanced budget for the current fiscal year, according to City  Manager R. Kenneth Jue.  </P> <P> The remainder of the deficit will come from several sources, including:  </P> <P> * $165,000 in further cutbacks by the city manager, including cutting one  full-time position to half time and eliminating the risk manager's position,  which is vacant.  </P> <P> * $550,000 from a recent increase in the franchise fee for trash collection  </P> <P> * $512,000 from Northrop Corp. for back sales taxes from 1983-85, a delinquency  detected by a state audit.  </P> <P> * Partial repayment of as much as $1.5 million of a city loan used by the  Redevelopment Agency to build the Hawthorne Plaza shopping center.  </P> <P> Any excess funds will be added to the city's $1-million reserves.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Fees to Double  </P> <P> Under a series of 11 resolutions approved Monday by the City Council, city fees  will double for some services, including zone-change applications, and will  increase 30% for others, including building permits.  </P> <P> The increases will bring Hawthorne fees up to the average prevailing in  surrounding cities, Jue said.  </P> <P> Because of the new revenues, no layoffs will be necessary, Jue said after  Monday's marathon five-hour budget session. Last month, Jue had said that as  many as 32 layoffs might be needed to make up the budget deficit and that one  of the city's fire stations, near the Holly Glen residential neighborhood,  might have to be closed.  </P> <P> In a July 7 budget message, Jue told the council that the city's budget was in  serious trouble because two major sources of expected income failed to  materialize. The city received $1.1 million less in sales tax revenues and  paramedic fees than had been projected in 1988-89, and an equal shortfall is  expected for 1989-90, Jue said.  </P> <P> A $300,000 expenditure for hiring five police officers made up the rest of the  deficit, Jue said. The hiring of the officers, who will be assigned to traffic  law enforcement, was retained in the budget adopted Monday by the City Council.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hundreds of Fees Affected  </P> <P> The council voted unanimously on a long list of fee increases in numerous  departments, including building, planning, engineering, police, airport and  recreation. Hundreds of fees will be affected.  </P> <P> During the public hearing, City Council candidate Raymon Sulser talked for 1  1/2 hours about the budget, challenging expenditures line by line and proposing  that the city close its youth camp, which he described as a frill.  </P> <P> Several other members of the public, including Councilman Steve Andersen's  mother, Dorothy Andersen, were upset at Sulser's suggestion on cutting back the  youth camp. "If you only knew how hard we worked to get those things," she  admonished Sulser, urging that the council not cut back on recreation programs.  </P> <P> Sulser also said the city could save $2 million a year by contracting with the  county for fire services rather than having its own department. But Fire Chief  Roger Milstead said the county could not provide cheaper services because its  salaries are higher than the city's across the board, from firefighter to fire  chief.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contention Repeated  </P> <P> Sulser on Monday repeated his contention that last fall's increase in the  city's water fees was a violation of Proposition 13. That measure and the  subsequent Proposition 62 barred cities from imposing new taxes without  approval by a two-thirds' majority of city voters. Cities can, however, pass on  to the public the cost of providing city services.  </P> <P> Councilman Andersen, a real estate attorney, disputed Sulser's claim about the  legality of the increase. He asked for a memorandum from the city attorney's  office on the legality of the city's water and trash collection fees. He said  he believes the city is on solid legal ground, and said to Sulser: "If you're  convinced you're right, why don't you file a taxpayer's suit?"  </P> <P> "Who's going to pay for it?" Sulser retorted.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the council introduced a new ordinance that would increase minimum  monthly water fees by about $2 a month, to $5 for residential customers.  Customers also pay fees based on the amount of water used. The council is  expected to vote on the water increase at its next meeting Monday.  </P></p>

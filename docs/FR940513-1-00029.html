Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1212 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. 13317, requires the Department of Energy to make, subject to the availability of appropriations, incentive payments to the owners or operators of qualified renewable energy facilities for the production and sale of electric energy from certain renewable energy sources. With certain exceptions, qualified renewable energy facilities are renewable energy conversion facilities (solar, wind, geothermal, or biomass) owned by States, subdivisions of States, or nonprofit electrical cooperatives that generate electric energy for sale. The goal of the incentive program is to advance the use of renewable energy conversion systems in the United States, particularly those systems that use emerging technologies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

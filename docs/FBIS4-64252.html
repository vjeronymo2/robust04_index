			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Kok Reluctant About Ministerial Post </F> in Brinkman Cabinet"]    [Excerpts] PvdA (Labor Party) leader Wim Kok is not sure  whether he will become minister in a cabinet which would be  headed by CDA [Christian Democratic Appeal] leader Elco  Brinkman. "If the CDA becomes the biggest party and can supply  the prime minister, it is `certainly' not obvious that the  present vice prime minister will become minister again."    This was stated by Kok during a series of discussions on the  commercial stations RTL4 [Luxembourg Radio and Television] and  RTL5 between the leaders of the four major parties. He answered  evasively to the question whether, in that case, he would become  floor leader in the Lower House. Kok has already stated in the  past that he and Brinkman are "not the most likely royal  couple." [passage omitted]    A poll conducted by Interview revealed that PvdA leader Kok  is the interviewees' favorite prime minister. Kok is chosen by  34 percent, Van Mierlo by 20 percent, Brinkman scores 18  percent, while Bolkestein gets merely 12 percent.    The interviewees have an increasing preference for a  "purple"  coalition comprising the PvdA, the D66 [Democrats 66], and the  VVD [People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]. Last time, a  coalition of the CDA, the PvdA and the D66 still scored highest  with 18.9 percent. The "purple" coalition gained 5 percent, and  has now taken the lead with 21 percent. A cabinet comprising  the CDA, the PvdA and the D66 has now become second choice.</p>

			<p><P> March 21, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN CLAIMS HE HAD SEX WITH HUDSON'S EX-LOVER  </P> <P> Attorneys for Rock Hudson's estate, seeking to overturn the recent  $21.75-million jury award to the actor's ex-lover Marc Christian, have made  public a sworn statement from a Laguna Niguel man who claims that Christian had  sex with him 6 weeks after Hudson's death in 1985.  </P> <P> The allegation by Gunther Albert Fraulob, a personal physical trainer, estate  attorneys contend, calls into question Christian's credibility and also raises  the question of whether Christian has engaged in deceitful conduct.  </P> <P> In the court document filed Monday, Fraulob states that he first met Christian  at a memorial service for Hudson, who died Oct. 2, 1985, of acquired immune  deficiency syndrome. Before the two had sex, he said, Christian assured him  that "he was safe, he was fine and he was healthy."  </P> <P> Christian, who has shown no medical signs of AIDS, won the massive award for  allegedly having suffered emotional trauma because Hudson and his private  secretary concealed the fact that the popular actor was suffering from the  fatal disease.  </P> <P> During the novel trial that concluded in mid-February, Christian testified that  he has remained celibate since Hudson's death because of his continuing fear  that he may have contracted the AIDS-related virus from Hudson.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Direct Contradiction  </P> <P> Fraulob's statement, which was immediately labeled as false by Christian's  attorney, was filed as part of a lengthy defense motion requesting that Los  Angeles Superior Court Judge Bruce R. Geernaert grant a new trial.  </P> <P> In the motion, the estate's lawyers argue that Fraulob's newly discovered  allegations are highly material because they constitute the first evidence  "directly contradicting (Christian's) testimony on the critical issue of fear."  </P> <P> The motion, on which a hearing has been set for April 7, also cites allegations  of juror misconduct and of technical errors by Geernaert during the 5-week  trial.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview Monday afternoon, Fraulob said he came forward because  "Marc Christian is lying, and he's doing it for one obvious reason -- to make  money."  </P> <P> Fraulob, 32, said he did not disclose his alleged relationship with Christian  during the trial because "I didn't want to drag my name through the mud . . .  (and) I didn't think my involvement would help the case in any way."  </P> <P> Fraulob described himself as a platonic friend of Hudson for 1 1/2 years before  the star's death.  </P> <P> "I don't believe (Christian) has AIDS because he told me that," Fraulob said in  the interview. "But I'm sure that if everything was proven different, then I  was exposed to it . . . and then I'd have fear of it."  </P> <P> In that case, Fraulob said, "I'm sure I'd take him to court to sue him for  exposing me to the virus."  </P> <P> And at that point, Fraulob added, he could in turn conceivably be held legally  responsible by his own sexual partners.  </P> <P> Christian could not be reached for comment Monday. But his attorney, Harold  Rhoden, said that Christian "categorically denies that there is any truth in  this, other than the fact that Fraulob did talk to Marc Christian at the time  of the wake, or the following day."  </P> <P> "From what I've been told and believe," Rhoden added, "Marc Christian never  even shook the guy's hand. . . . He didn't meet with him on or about Nov. 15,  1985, or at any other time or any other place for any activity."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Robert Parker Mills, an attorney for the Hudson estate, said he was  "satisfied with the truthfulness" of Fraulob's allegations and challenged  Christian "to take a lie detector test. . . ."  </P> <P> Fraulob said he met Hudson in early 1984 while working as a waiter in a Long  Beach hotel restaurant and that Hudson, with whom he never had sex, later  accompanied him to Hawaii. Hudson, Fraulob said, once told him that he had  tried to kick Christian out of his house but that Christian would not leave and  planned to expose him as being gay.  </P></p>

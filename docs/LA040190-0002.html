			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SIZZLER  </P> <P> I enjoyed the article about Sizzler, and its depiction of Sizzler cuisine --  "Is it pre-Melrose, Melrose or post-Melrose?" I've been to many Sizzlers, and  the hamburger seems to have disappeared off the menu. A better question might  be is the hamburger post-Melrose, or am I merely post-Sizzler?  </P> <P> JOHN M.

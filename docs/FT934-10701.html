			<p>931104 FT  04 NOV 93 / EC air policies attacked: CAA warns of threats to competition; Blocking tactics would give rise to 'higher fares and less choice' THE Civil Aviation Authority yesterday warned of threats to competition in the European airline industry and put forward proposals to counter delaying and blocking tactics on 'open skies' by some European Community countries and their national carriers. Mr Christopher Chataway, the CAA chairman, said the EC's air transport liberalisation policy had created the conditions for more competition but there was a serious risk that countries would seek to undermine its implementation. 'If the policy is not adopted in practice there could be even more concentration, even less competition leading to higher fares and less choice for consumers,' he warned. Mr Clifford Paice, the CAA's head of economic regulation, added: 'The danger is that the industry's short-term problems will lead to short-term solutions which in turn will lead to long-term problems.' In a document published yesterday, the CAA called for a change in EC policy on landing and take-off slot allocation at congested airports, tougher controls on state aid for financially troubled airlines, the application of a more rigorous EC aviation mergers and acquisitions policy similar to the policy applied to other industrial sectors, and stringent safeguards against anti-competitive behaviour. The report, which is expected to be the first of a series of documents to maintain pressure on the EC to pursue its airline liberalisation policies, shows that normal economy fares on EC routes in continental Europe are about 30 per cent higher than routes from the UK to the EC and domestic US routes. It also shows that EC airline costs, with the possible exception of British Airways, Virgin and British Midland, are significantly higher than those of US carriers. The report highlights the fact that most of the busiest international routes in the EC have a congested airport at one end and that there are no more than two airlines on most routes. 'More than 95 per cent of EC routes are monopolies or duopolies and only 26 routes in the EC have more than two carriers,' said Mr Paice. The report shows that flag carriers have been forced to lower fares when a third airline has entered a busy route. Although the CAA is not calling for the confiscation of slots at busy airports from dominant airlines, it is proposing a toughening of EC slot rules which require half of all newly created slots at congested airports to be granted to new entrants. 'We think this is not enough and too slow,' said Mr Paice. The CAA wants all newly created, unused or otherwise available slots to be earmarked for new competitors. On state aid, Mr Chataway acknowledged it was unrealistic to expect it to be completely eliminated in a European industry where only BA was a fully privatised flag carrier. But he said a limit had to be placed on government aid for airline restructuring which should not be allowed to finance the acquisition of other airlines or market share. 'State aid to keep Air France afloat is OK: but financing Air France to buy BA is not,' Mr Paice said. Airline Competition in the Single European Market. CAA, PO Box 41, Cheltenham, Glos, GL50 2BN.

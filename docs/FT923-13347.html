			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Mexico's ruling party faces defeat MEXICO'S centre-right National Action party (PAN) is set to win the governorship of Chihuahua state, only the second time that the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) has lost a gubernatorial election in its 63-year history. Voting was quiet and relatively trouble-free. Last night the official state electoral commission put Mr Francisco Barrio, the PAN candidate, 15 to 20 percentage points ahead of the PRI with over half the votes counted. According to the unofficial count of the PAN, which claimed victory, Mr Barrio's party had an estimated 54 per cent of the vote. Later, the PRI candidate in the largest and richest state conceded defeat. However, the PRI appeared to be leading in the weekend's other gubernatorial election, in the state of Michoacan, where the main opposition was the left-of-centre Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). The PRI said it was ahead by about two to one after counting 70 per cent of the votes - an estimate backed up by early official returns. In contrast the PRD estimated that it was narrowly ahead after counting votes at around 20 per cent of the polling booths. The contending claims could prepare the way for a tense post-electoral period. The PRD is planning to hold a victory rally today, which may turn into a demonstration against the government party. The PRI hopes that a defeat for the PRD in the stronghold of its president, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, would make it difficult for it to mount an effective challenge in the 1994 presidential elections. For this reason the PRI mounted one of the most expensive and sophisticated campaigns in its history, spending Dollars 33m (Pounds 17.2m) in the state, according to observer groups' estimates.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moldovan Prime Minister Andre Sangheli said at a  news conference in Chisinau Thursday that the leaders of the  self-proclaimed Dniester Republic are threatening to cut off the  gas and energy supply to the western bank of the Dniester. He  talked with the Tiraspol leaders on the telephone Thursday in an  attempt to avoid this development.    He did not think that there were good reasons for cutting  off  the gas supply.    Sangheli said that Tiraspol wanted to discontinue the energy  supplies because Moldova had not paid for them.</p>

			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SWEDEN'S SUNDQVIST IS KING OF THE HILL;  </P> <P> SKIING: HE DEFEATS COUNTRYMAN WALLNER TO WIN U.S. PRO TOUR EVENT AT SNOW SUMMIT  AND MAINTAINS HIS LEAD IN OVERALL STANDINGS.  </P> <P> Jorgen Sundqvist picked up a winner's check for $5,000 at Snow Summit Sunday  and doesn't care if the IRS knows about it. He's quite happy to pay taxes in  the United States, rather than in his native Sweden.  </P> <P> "The rate is much higher at home," he said, "so it is better to pay here."  </P> <P> So far, in his 1 1/2 seasons on the U.S. Pro Tour, Sundqvist, 27, and the IRS  have shared many moments of happiness. The Swede won the overall championship  as a rookie, earning $101,874 in prize money, plus at least that much again  from various contracts. Now, after 13 races this season, he leads the standings  with 281 points and has deposited another $25,400 (less taxes) in his U.S. bank  account.  </P> <P> Sundqvist, who defeated fellow countryman Joakim Wallner in the final of  Sunday's slalom, shared honors for the weekend with Christian Orlansky, who  beat Sebastian Vitzthum in an all-Austrian giant slalom final Saturday.  </P> <P> For Phil Mahre of Yakima, Wash., it was something of a lost weekend.  </P> <P> The three-time World Cup champion and 1984 Olympic slalom gold medalist, lost  to Orlansky in the first round Saturday, then was eliminated by Vitzthum in the  second round Sunday. He picked up only 20 points and fell from fifth to ninth  place in the standings, 100 points behind Sundqvist.  </P> <P> Mahre first knew he was in trouble, he said, when Orlansky "shot out of the  starting gate like a rocket" in the first of their two head-to-head runs. "When  he did it again in the second run," Mahre said, "I figured he had a pretty good  chance to go all the way and win the race."  </P> <P> Orlansky, 27, did just that, scoring his first pro victory and moving into  second place behind Italian Marco Tonazzi in the competition for  rookie-of-the-year honors. Asked how he suddenly became a winner, Orlansky  said: "It's probably because I have my girlfriend here. That's why I'm skiing  so fast."  </P> <P> Ingrid Paoli, standing nearby, confirmed that she had been in the United States  for the last three pro events but would be returning home to Feldkirch,  Austria, after next weekend's races at Winter Park, Colo. "Then, he must do it  on his own," she said.  </P> <P> After 10 years on the Austrian team, Orlansky did not race at all last winter.  "They dropped me," he said. "So, I tried to ski for Belgium, but it didn't work  out. It has taken me a little longer to get in shape again this season.  </P> <P> "At first, I didn't like the pro style of racing (on dual courses with two  built-in jumps). But now I am getting used to it, and everything is OK."  </P> <P> In Sunday's slalom, Orlansky reached the quarterfinals, where he lost to the  ultimate race winner, Sundqvist.  </P> <P> Mahre, meanwhile, was already back in the lodge, his racing day over. He won  his first run against Vitzthum by 0.043 of a second, but got off to a bad start  in their second encounter and never caught up, allowing the Austrian to finish  0.220 ahead for a net victory margin of 0.177.  </P> <P> "My right pole just slipped in the snow as I left the starting gate," Mahre  said, "and I was slow in gaining momentum."  </P> <P> About halfway down the hill, Vitzthum sprayed up a rooster tail of snow right  in Mahre's face, seemingly causing him to falter for a moment.  </P> <P> "I couldn't see the next gate," Mahre said, "and I had to guess where the one  after that was, but I didn't have any excuses. He just outskied me."  </P> <P> Mahre skied without either his twin brother, Steve, or their younger sibling,  Paul, both of whom are out with knee injuries. Steve won't race again this  season, but Paul could be back at least for the Million Dollar Plymouth Super  Series in March.  </P> <P> Tour director Ed Rogers estimated that with the added money available in those  three events, plus some potential bonuses in the World Pro Championships at  Nagano, Japan, on Feb. 8-11, this year's pro champion could earn as much as  $300,000.  </P> <P> "And sponsorship money would probably double, or even triple, that amount,"  Rogers said.  </P> <P> Sundqvist, the current tour leader, smiled and nodded in agreement when that  figure was mentioned, but he isn't counting on anything, yet.  </P> <P> "(Bernhard) Knauss is very tough," he said, "and (Tomaz) Cerkovnik has been  skiing very well."  </P> <P> Knauss, of Austria, is third in the standings with 220 points but has won the  most money, $27,025. Cerkovnik, of Yugoslavia, is second with 241 points and  has earned $21,800.  </P> <P> One racer who was not smiling on a bright, sunny day in the San Bernardino  Mountains was Roland Pfeifer of Austria, who was disqualified in the slalom  semifinals for two "barges," or false starts. However, through a  misinterpretation of the rules, an official allowed him to make his first run  against Wallner, in which he posted a 0.389 margin. Then they told him it  didn't count. He was out, and wouldn't even be able to ski in the consolation  final.  </P> <P> On the awards podium, Pfeifer was still complaining, and when the announcer  said it was too bad and everyone was sorry, the fourth-place finisher in the  slalom said: "I'm sorry. That's not enough."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The Bundesrat called upon Bonn  to deepen and strengthen the European Union [EU] during the  German EU presidency in the second half of 1994. In that  context, the government should in particular work toward greater  closeness to the people, democracy, and strengthening the Union  externally to allow the swift admission of the European Free  Trade Association states.    Cooperation with the Central and East European states has to  be moved forward, German must be recognized as an official EU  language, and the European Parliament must be strengthened. All  the laender endorsed a resolution underlining their joint  responsibility for preparing "the important task of the German  presidency of the Council."    Saarland Prime Minister Oskar Lafontaine (SPD) stressed that  all those questioning European integration were jeopardizing the  stability of the continent and facilitating nationalism. The  most important task is to combat widespread unemployment by  creating new jobs. Democracy also means access to work.  [passage omitted]</p>

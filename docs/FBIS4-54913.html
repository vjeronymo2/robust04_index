			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Gabor Kuncze, chairman of the Alliance of </F> Free Democrats and the party's candidate for the position of  prime minister, by Attila Zsoldos; place and date not given:  "There Is a Chance for a Stable Coalition"]    [Text] Gabor Kuncze does not take it for granted that the  parties' formulations on their coalition alliance possibilities  will be of long duration. He regards these declaration as  campaign tricks. In his view, the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] cannot achieve a worse result at the elections than  second place.    [Zsoldos] In view of the latest opinion polls, do you see  any chance of a stable government coalition after the elections?    [Kuncze] The opinion polls reflect trends. The election  results will really show the coalition possibilities. With this  restriction, my opinion is that there is a chance for a stable  coalition after the elections.    [Zsoldos] Mutual exclusions could be heard from various  political parties during the election campaign. The Hungarian  Democratic Forum [MDF] excluded the possibility of a coalition  with the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] and the SZDSZ under  the current leadership; the MDF had a similar position regarding  the Christian Democratic People's Party [KDNP]. The Federation  of Young Democrats [Fidesz] rejected the idea of a government  coalition with the MSZP. These are only a few examples. Have  the parties not narrowed their scope too much before the  elections?    [Kuncze] Most of these exclusions are not more than campaign  tricks. It is not worth dealing with them too much. These  positions of the current government parties show that they would  like to be in the opposition after the elections. They should  not be hindered in this.    [Zsoldos] In other words, you would not take it for granted  that these positions will last long?    [Kuncze] I do not generally take anything for granted,  particularly not political issues.    [Zsoldos] There have been conflicts between the SZDSZ and  the Fidesz lately, but you said that there are no unbridgeable  differences of views between the two parties. Is it true?    [Kuncze] That is true.    [Zsoldos] Do you not regard the fact that the Fidesz  excludes the possibility of a coalition with the MSZP while the  SZDSZ does not exclude such a possibility as such an  unbridgeable difference?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ does not exclude the possibility of  coalition with any democratic party, and I do not know of any  such official position on the part of the Fidesz. Viktor Orban  generally speaks about this in his own name.    [Zsoldos] Among other things, the SZDSZ focused its campaign  on doing everything in its power for the best possible results  of the liberal bloc and on making sure that a stable government  coalition will emerge after the elections. Which of these two  goals do you regard as more important?    [Kuncze] I think it is important for the liberal parties to  achieve good results, but it is also important that, aware of  the election results, the SZDSZ should examine the possibilities  of coalition agreements. It is not justified now to set up an  importance list. I will know the real possibilities in a few  days. Let us wait until then.    [Zsoldos] Many people say, including the government parties,  that the SZDSZ might disintegrate if it forms a coalition with a  strong MSZP.    [Kuncze] Who said that the SZDSZ would form a coalition with  a strong MSZP? Nor did anyone say that the SZDSZ would form a  coalition with the MSZP at all. At the moment, all I can say is  that we should wait for the election results.    [Zsoldos] What guarantees will the SZDSZ ask in exchange for  its willingness to participate in the government coalition?    [Kuncze] We have already published our position, in which we  formulated the coalition guidelines in 25 points. We will stick  to these guidelines.    [Zsoldos] Could it be a guarantee that, in a given  circumstance, the SZDSZ will provide the prime minister?    [Kuncze] The SZDSZ is not striving to achieve good results  at the elections. If our hopes come true, we will consider  this. This is only natural.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Conservative Party chairman Kaci </F> Kullmann Five by Heidi Borud; place and date not given]    [Text] It is not a beaten party leader who will be saying  "Thank you and good-bye" at the Conservative Party national  conference at the weekend. A very positive Conservative Party  leader is putting the finishing touches to the speech she will  deliver to the conference in Bergen on Friday [8 April].    The Grieg Hall and the Hotell Norge will be the two arenas  for the Conservatives' national conference at which Kaci  Kullmann Five will hand over the chairman's gavel to her good  friend, Storting deputy Jan Petersen -- he too comes from  Akershus.    The two know each other well from over 20 years of close  political cooperation. And Kullmann Five is generous in her  praise: "Jan is solid through and through and extremely  capable. He is a politician with broad experience -- much  broader than many people think."    Kaci Kullmann Five stressed that she is not saying good-bye  to Norwegian national politics. A Conservative Party with a  thin 17 percent of support does not scare this lady away from  new positions of responsibility. She will continue as the  Conservative Party's EU [European Union] spokeswoman in the  Storting and have a seat on the Foreign Affairs Committee  alongside Jan Petersen, among others.    Will you be the Conservative Party's prime ministerial  candidate in the 1997 Storting elections?    "I have not come to any decision about what my life will be  like in 1997, about whether I will continue in politics or not.  It is the party and the Storting group which together will  decide who they will ask to become the party's prime ministerial  candidate."    The current battle surrounding the EU will be the main theme  of the party leader's speech to the national conference. She  makes it very clear that in the ranks of the Conservative Party  too there are many who have their doubts about the EU, even some  opponents, who have to be won over. In the last election the  Conservative Party lost 36,000 voters to the Center Party.    "There will be no Norwegian EU membership if the  Conservative  Party does not do its part of the job. We have to get the  doubters over onto the `yes' side. The Labor Party is important  in this context, but they cannot do the job alone," she pointed  out.    In her EU arguments she attaches great importance to the  overarching peace and security dimensions, and she made it clear  that she has little time for "newly converted Socialist Left  Party members who think that NATO is enough."    "NATO is important, but the EU will play the totally  dominant  role in the peacekeeping work in Europe. This is work that goes  much further than what is purely defense policy and which  includes the environment, trade, and the economy," the former  trade minister said.    "A pan-European security solution is within reach. Even if  Anne Enger Lahnstein refuses to realize it, it is nevertheless a  fact that the countries of East Europe are moving toward the  EU," Kullmann Five said.    She sees the EU as an important tool for combatting negative  nationalism -- and as a tool which could could make a  contribution to the construction of democracy in the former East  European states.    Environmental policy is another area which figure frequently  in the Conservative Party's arguments in favor of EU membership:    "I am not satisfied with the EU's environmental policy, and  it will be a great challenge to strengthen it. But it is worth  noting statements from the well regarded World Watch Institute  which writes that the EU has contributed to better environmental  conditions across the whole continent," Kullmann Five said.    She said that the Conservative Party will fight for its  political values and its policies inside the European Union:  "We will combat the bureaucracy, among other things. Here the  EU has gone too far. And as far as supranationality and the  environment are concerned, it has not gone far enough," she said.    When the EU referendum is over, international environmental  issues will be one of the fields in which she wants to work more  from her place on the Storting Foreign Affairs Committee.    What are the most important political results the  Conservative Party has achieved under your leadership?    "What I am most happy about is that we were able to defend  the watercourses at Stryn and Gaular. This was all thanks to  the Conservative Party and is of great importance for  biodiversity, the experience of nature, and tourism.    ``But the most important goal -- government power -- we did  not achieve. Henry Valen is right when he says that the EU  question has hit the Conservative Party hard.''    Is there any hope of a nonsocialist coalition after the EU  referendum?    "One can always hope, but it is the Center Party that is the  main problem, not the Conservative Party. This is something  that I would like AFTENPOSTEN's leader writers to realize soon.  There is actually a party that has disappeared on the  nonsocialist side and this is not the Conservative Party's  fault."</p>

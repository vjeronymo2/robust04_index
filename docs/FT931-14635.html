			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Private View: Why every new baby matters - Dr Norman Myers believes that population is still the most important issue THE FAMINES are returning, and so are the population experts to scare us with their sums. But if their projections are even half-correct, why do we pay so little heed to them? My consultants told me to go and see Norman Myers. Dr Myers is no two-bit Jeremiah: he advises governments and institutions such as the World Bank, the OECD, United Nations and European Commission. He is not afraid of upsetting politically-correct Greens by proposing market solutions. But even he resorts to the occasional shocker. 'In terms of the amount it consumes and pollutes, the average British family has not two children but more like 30 or 35,' he said. So it's at the expense of others that we live? 'Yes. And that applies to all the other developed nations.' Are you saying that a British or American baby is stealing from, say, a Bangladeshi baby? 'I wouldn't quite use that term. I would say our increasing population and affluence - dependent on artificially cheap fossil fuels - are bringing on global warming which could mean Bangladesh losing as much as one fifth of its territory within a lifetime. 'That's the equivalent of Britain losing all land south of London and Bristol. We would be very indignant if that was caused by people round the back of the world who'd been over-indulging.' I'm impressed, I said, but what are we supposed to do? To be fair to the Bangladeshis we'd have to go back to eating ground-nuts and living in tents. 'No, no. An acceptable level of affluence would be something akin to what we had in 1970.' How many fewer children should we have? Myers paused. 'Well, I'd hesitate to offer an estimate because it's a complicated calculation: I'm hedging, of course. The optimum population for Britain, sustainable in a global context, would be a good deal less than what we have now unless we're prepared to get into a much more streamlined economy with far less waste and more efficient modes of production.' Isn't there a more compelling argument for us to reproduce less, apart, that is, from wanting the cash for more consumption? 'Suppose the trade-off was more vacations in the Caribbean or learning to ski.' I might do that, I said. 'Had you ever thought explicitly of that trade-off?' Not personally, I said. But I'm sure people do, which is why they have only 1.7 kids, or whatever it is. But if we've got to bring it down to 1.1, isn't it going to be a bit of a problem? 'Yes,' he admitted. 'It would be a very big problem.' Norman Myers was not born an eco-freak. It was somehow reassuring to learn that this modest marathon-runner read French and German at Oxford and worked as a district officer in the colonial service in up-country Kenya before that country's looming population explosion turned him to planetary economics. He travelled the world, took a PhD at Berkeley and worked with UN agencies before concluding that he had no time for 'corridor politics', and set out as a freelance consultant. Why do people and politicians continue to ignore the sums you and others put in front of them? I asked him. 'In many countries, such as sub- Saharan Africa, it's a culturally taboo subject and politicians don't want to upset the electorate. In Latin America they say the place is underpopulated because there is so much space. Some countries believe large populations mean political power and economic strength. They quote the US, Russia and Japan. They ignore the example of Israel, say, or the Netherlands.' I suggested population doomsters such as Paul Ehrlich and the Club of Rome had spiked their own guns by exaggeration. Myers countered that since Ehrlich's 1968 prediction of massive famine, 250m people had died of starvation, though not, admittedly, all in one place. Technology had only postponed the problem. For three decades to 1984 the plough had kept ahead of the stork, but since then there had been eight lean years in which food production had failed to keep pace. The Club of Rome report in the 1970s had been premature, he admitted, and had ignored some important feedback loops (eg prices) but its latest report was more sophisticated. Why isn't the US taking a lead? 'Because American political leaders won't lead. They're too bound up with their next election. They think that doubling the tax on gasoline to bring it more into line with European rates would be unacceptable. In real terms Americans were paying two and half dollars a gallon in 1981. They shouldn't scream if they are asked to pay double the present price of Dollars 1.25.' But all politicians were at fault in refusing to recognise that raising fossil-fuel efficiency to match, say, the Japanese would be very good for their economies. How can you say Britain is overpopulated? I asked him. There is no starvation. The rivers may be a bit low and the beaches a bit dirty, but we live very comfortably. 'But we depend on a shadow ecology, as I call it, which is five times the size of Britain and on which we depend for some 40 per cent of our food.' He conceded that effective population control could take several generations after millenia of carefree breeding. 'Governments are reluctant to intervene beyond the bedroom door. And yet we accept a minimum age for sexual intercourse, for getting married. We plan every aspect of our economies except the number of consumers.' But aren't there moral limitations? Are Catholics who accept the Vatican line on birth control to be coerced? 'No, not at all. But they are such a tiny minority now. Anyway the European country with the lowest fertility rate is Italy and the part of Italy with the lowest fertility rate is Rome.' Surely you mean the Vatican City? 'I should hope so,' Myers laughed. What about the Moslems? 'The Koran says various forms of contraception are legitimate. The real problem is women in purdah. Only about 5 per cent have been to primary school, their social standing is low and they can't stand up to their husbands.' You have said zero population growth could be achieved in Britain by the 'simple expedient' of preventing all unwanted births. 'It's simple but not easy. It's a matter of education. After a Saturday night out and a couple of pints, anything can happen. That sounds awfully patronising but there are a lot of people who end up with unwanted pregnancies.' There should be financial disincentives for having more than two children. 'If you have three and impose a lot of spillover costs on society then I'd devise ways to make you pay those costs.' Myers referred approvingly to one economist's proposal that everybody should be given a single 'child voucher' at birth. Couples could have their two children or sell their vouchers to someone else. Enforcement could be tricky, I said. 'Exceedingly.' The world population is over 5bn. In 100 years' time it could as high as 14 1/2 bn or as low as 8bn. 'There's a lot to play for,' said Myers. 'I say we should go for the lower figure. Either we choose to do it or nature will do it for us - and nature will not do it discriminately at all.' Surely, it will discriminate against the poorest. People like you and I will be as comfortable as ever. 'I don't think so. Because one of the predominant phenomena of the next few decades, I believe, will be mass migration from developing to developed countries. What we have now in Europe is peanuts compared with what lies ahead. The social tensions we have seen in Germany and France already are nothing to what is to come.' Global warming could give Britain an arid Mediterranean landscape. In such a world - 'a world in uproar and full of gunsmoke' - Britain simply could not trade. There could be 300m or 500m refugees battering on the doors of the rich nations. 'We win with the Third World or we shall lose with them,' Myers said. Yet it would cost only some Dollars 40bn a year to make agriculture in the Third World environmentally sustainable - which is what rich nations already spend on slimming aids. To meet demand for contraception would cost taxpayers in the North a penny a week. 'It needn't cost the earth to save the earth and it would give a much better return in the long run than anything available on the London stock exchange.' How many children have you got? 'Two: both daughters. And I dearly wish, I'm really ticked off that I couldn't have more . . . for professional reasons. I wish there was a bank or something at the United Nations to which I could pay Pounds 10,000 or Pounds 12,000 a year to cover the social costs. And then, boy, I would certainly have a third child. Heavens, yes.'</p>

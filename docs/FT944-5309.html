			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / As They Say in Europe: German dullness begins at home A few weeks ago a German colleague rang the Berlin office for a fax of an item in the Berliner Zeitung relating to the thoughts of the finance minister Theo Waigel on the course of future taxation. Instead, he got an article which referred to the long-standing relationship between Waigel, 55, and the skiing star and Olympic silver medallist, Irene Epple, 37. That was a surprise: although anybody connected with the media knew of the affair, it was never publicly mentioned. Then, in October, Waigel divorced his wife of 28 years, Karin, and on Saturday married his 'companion'. This was all much more interesting than the normal stuff of German news - political manoeuvrings in Saxony-Anhalt for example. But when it comes to German news, German papers are relentlessly boring. Imagine that a British chancellor of the exchequer had kept a sporting mistress for some years. Imagine the hullabaloo had he married her. Yet, newspapers across Germany produced just one picture of the wedding on an obscure page. It showed 'the happy couple with Chancellor Kohl (left) and his wife Hannelore (right)'. The youth team of the local ski club made a bridal arch with their skis. How much more interesting it would have been in Britain. The secret wedding date would never have been kept secret. There would have been television cameras at the home of the ex-wife; stories in the Daily Mail about 'The minister who wronged me'. Tabloid headline writers would have had a field day. Thunderous editorials would have accused the prime minister of letting down the nation, or not as the case may be, had he attended the wedding that consecrated the illicit relationship. But maybe there is nothing very interesting in finance ministers getting mixed up with skiers. Perhaps the British are mad or decadent for allowing similar concerns to occupy so much newsprint. But even a German would agree that such matters make for more lively reading than tales of interminable political manoeuvrings in Saxon wastes. Germany is dull only in the hands of German journalists. And German journalists make only Germany dull; when they get their hands on Italy or Russia they can produce fascinating material. But one learns more about a nation from what it writes about others than what it writes about itself. Thus a few days ago there was a rollicking piece in the Frankfurter Allgemeine about a northern Croatian town called Varazdin. It was by Johann Georg Reissmuller who, although devoted to his native land, has had a long affair with Croatia. His story was headlined 'Bourgeois, churchgoing, German-friendly'. These, by the way, are all meant to be virtues. The article was one of those patronising pieces which are much admired by a certain kind of German conservative who believes his eastern neighbours are longing for the day German hegemony reasserts itself throughout the region. It told of how a distant town had been civilised by its close connections with German culture and, as a result, was now made up of diligent craftsmen, Franciscan churches, baroque organs and heroic defenders of faith and nation facing up to the Serb menace. 'The Varazdin chamber orchestra plays Bach's violin concerto in E major with seemingly German devotion,' said the report. A few rosy-cheeked milkmaids and the picture would have been complete. Had a French journalist gone to the same town, his or her report would have been about the resurrection of the Ustashe (Croatian fascists), and contained interviews with old collaborators and concentration camp guards. An Italian would have found an Italian family or ruin, a Brit a ski slope. And so to Norway and its rejection of EU membership. For Germans, Norway is a kind of Germanic ideal. Thus the old Communist Party paper in Berlin, Neues Deutschland, said Ibsen was the victor. Like his heroine, Nora, Norwegians had refused to go back into the prehistory of emancipation or risk their environmental perfection. The business daily, Handlesblatt, put a Nordic dream into modern dress in analysing its isolation: 'Yet Norway survives: oil, natural gas, waterfalls with power stations, fish in the Atlantic and ships on the oceans take care of that . . .everything tomorrow will be like yesterday for the people of the North Atlantic.' In Bavaria, the Suddeutsche Zeitung comforted itself with the thought that if Norway had refused, at least Sweden, Finland and Austria had not. 'The three will bring nobility into the Community from outside and make it, one hopes, internally more respectable for the citizens.' And put a stop, one hopes, to those unsavoury and unmentionable entanglements of Bavarian politicians. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

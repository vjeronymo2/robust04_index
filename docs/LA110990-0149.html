			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WESTMINSTER MAKES HILL WAIT FOR RECORD  </P> <P> The season ended Thursday night for Santa Ana High School's football team, not  with a record for its coach and cheers from its fans but with hands on hips and  heads hanging low.  </P> <P> Santa Ana was trying to give Coach Dick Hill his 192nd career victory, an  Orange County record.  </P> <P> But Santa Ana couldn't stop Westminster quarterback Matt Bailey, who threw  three touchdown passes and ran for a fourth score to lead the Lions to a 27-7  victory at Santa Ana Stadium.  </P> <P> Westminster (5-4-1, 4-1-1) clinched second place and a berth in the Southern  Section Division I playoffs, which begin next week.  </P> <P> Hill, who has coached in Orange County for 25 seasons, the last seven at Santa  Ana, has a county mark of 191-82-3. He remains tied with former Loara Coach  Herb Hill (no relation).  </P> <P> "Every win is great. I've had 191 and I've enjoyed every one," Hill said. "The  losses I hate. So I hated this loss."  </P> <P> Santa Ana, which stayed close only until halftime, ends its season 3-7, 2-4 in  Sunset League play. The mark tied Hill's worst at Santa Ana, in 1984, his first  at the school after four years away from coaching. Hill also coached at Santa  Ana Valley from 1959-79.  </P> <P> "We knew Santa Ana would be emotionally high," said Stan Clark, Westminster  coach. "We had to be just as high. Bailey matured a lot tonight. He showed a  lot of poise."  </P> <P> Bailey completed six of 12 passes for 86 yards and touchdowns of eight and 21  yards to tight end Eric Wilkins and 20 yards to Enrique Gonzalez. He also ran  eight yards around left end for another touchdown.  </P> <P> After trailing, 6-0, Santa Ana rallied for a 7-6 lead on Kevin Pola's one-yard  dive and Gus Plasencia's extra point. But Westminster took the lead for good on  Bailey's 21-yard scoring pass to Wilkins with 15 seconds left in the half.  </P> <P> Santa Ana could scratch out just 19 yards of offense in the second half as  Westminster's defense, tough all game, belted the Saints' running backs  repeatedly.  </P> <P> Pola, who had 38 yards in 11 carries by halftime, finished with 36 yards in 15  carries. Dasy Tech had 35 yards in three carries, including a 24-yard gain, the  longest of the game for Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Lucas Jones rushed for 98 yards in 16 carries and Vance Senteno had 53 yards in  six carries for Westminster.  </P></p>

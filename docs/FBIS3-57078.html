(For a  while last year he was the Russian president's representative in  the Ossetian-Ingush conflict zone.)    [Skukin] Do you intend to return to the Ossetian-Ingush  problem -- this time in your new capacity?    [Kostoyev] It will be time to extend the president's edict  on the state of emergency in the conflict zone in a few days'  time, and I, as chairman of the Federation Council Committe for  Legislation and Judicial and Legal Reforms, will insist that a  group of deputies travel to the trouble spot first.    [Skukin] Issa Magametovich, what matters within your area of  competence are truly urgent?    [Kostoyev] It is essential to establish which power  structures are to deal with what. The introduction of trial by  jury has revealed Russia's all-around lack of preparation for  civilized legal proceedings. Our laws are often ill-drafted and  contradictory. A huge army of investigators from the former  Security Ministry has been jettisoned, but not every lawyer is  capable of being an investigator. These people won't be wasted;  they are professionals, and they are going into commercial  structures. Investigation, however, will suffer: Only 40  percent of crimes are being detected now.    [Skukin] What will you be seeking to achieve when you start  your new job?    [Kotsoyev] I will be seeking firmly and persistently to  ensure that when we draft Russian laws we include within them a  mechanism for their implementation. Laws must operate with  clockwork precision.</p>

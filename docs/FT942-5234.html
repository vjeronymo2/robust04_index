			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Working Life: Share option tax options - Finance When UK executives make a killing overnight out of their share option schemes, their smiles can be wiped away at the thought of the tax they will incur on cashing in their windfall. Gains are liable to capital gains tax 40 per cent for a higher-rate taxpayer. What can be done to bring down the tax burden? A share option gives the holder the right today to acquire tomorrow shares in his company, at today's price. In a conventional Inland Revenue-approved executive scheme, this can be any time during the period of seven years following the third anniversary of the day he was given the right. The main tax-planning tool is the annual CGT exemption of Pounds 5,800 - not enough to shelter substantial gains. For these, David Cohen, partner in the City law firm of Paisner &amp; Co, suggests spreading disposals over more than one tax year and involving a spouse. He gives the following example: 'Suppose that Judith has an option to buy 10,000 shares for 150p each and she exercises it in June 1994 when the price has risen to 400p. Full CGT on Judith's gain of Pounds 25,000 (10,000 x 250p) would amount to Pounds 10,000, pushing back her net profit to just Pounds 15,000. 'On the assumption that Judith has no other taxable gains, she can sell tax-free approximately 2,300 shares in this tax year and (assuming no change in the share price) a further 2,300 in the tax year which begins on 6 April 1995.' However, he warns executives against exercising in each tax year only the number of shares which they plan to sell in that year, in preference to exercising the whole option (that is, buying the shares) and then selling them over a number of years. 'To do so would be a painful blunder. If an executive option is exercised twice within a three-year period, the profit on the second option will be fully taxed as income, thereby scuppering any chance of using the CGT exemption.' Instead, it is possible for those who are married to exploit their spouse's CGT-saving potential. A gift of shares will generally be treated as a disposal by the donor at market value but this rule does not apply to transfers between spouses. So Judith's husband, Alan, can receive and sell 2,300 shares in this tax year and in 1995/96 without incurring any CGT. 'As a result of a combination of patience and marital teamwork, 9,200 shares will have been cashed in tax-free. Even if the remaining 800 shares are taxed, the taxable gain will have been reduced from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 2,000 thereby boosting the net profit from Pounds 15,000 to Pounds 24,200 - a 61 per cent rise.' Holders of savings-related options have even more flexibility. 'Up to Pounds 3,000 worth of shares acquired on the exercise of such options can be transferred annually into a single company personal equity plan,' says Cohen. 'The transfer will be tax-free provided it takes pace within 90 days of exercise and from then on the single-company Pep will give complete protection against income tax on dividends and CGT on sale.' Unfortunately, this privilege does not apply to holders of executive options.</p>

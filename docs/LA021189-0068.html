			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STOCK PRICES PLUNGE; DOW OFF 36.97;  </P> <P> REKINDLED INFLATION FEARS, PROFIT TAKING HURT MARKET  </P> <P> Renewed fears of higher interest rates and inflation -- along with a bout of  profit taking -- sent the stock market reeling Friday in its biggest decline of  the year and raised worries that the robust rally of 1989 may have run out of  steam.  </P> <P> A bigger-than-expected jump in producer prices, along with hikes in banks'  prime lending rate, help push the Dow Jones industrial index down 36.97 points  to close at 2,286.07. That was the Dow's largest single-day decline since Nov.  16.  </P> <P> The drop, representing a decline of 1.6%, was broadly felt among other issues,  as declining issues outnumbered advances on the New York Stock Exchange by more  than 4 to 1. Big Board volume totaled 173.56 million shares, down from 224.22  million in the previous session.  </P> <P> Analysts said the drop was initially triggered by a government report released  Friday morning suggesting that inflation is higher than earlier believed. The  report by the Labor Department showed that producer prices -- involving  finished goods at the manufacturer level -- jumped 1% in January. That was the  sharpest rise since October, 1985, and at least twice economists' estimates.  </P> <P> The rise promptly raised fears that the Federal Reserve Board would continue to  boost interest rates -- possibly including its all-important discount rate on  loans to member banks -- in a bid to cool the inflation surge. Perhaps  responding to that fear, several major banks on Friday raised their prime  lending rate to 11% from 10.5%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bonds Sold Off  </P> <P> "Many people think a discount rate boost is coming and with the prime rate  boost, that added gas to the fire," said Norman Mains, director of research at  the Los Angeles brokerage of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc.  </P> <P> Investors also responded to the new interest rate fears by selling off bonds,  raising their yields, which will in turn add further upward pressure on  interest rates.  </P> <P> Analysts also said investors were disappointed by President Bush's speech to  Congress on Thursday night, saying that it was short on specifics on how to cut  the nation's bulging federal budget deficit. Lack of action on the deficit will  fuel further upward pressure on interest rates, economists say.  </P> <P> Analysts also said investors were ripe to cash in profits after the Dow had  risen some 8.2% so far this year, through Tuesday. After hitting a post-crash  high of 2,347.14 on Tuesday, the Dow has fallen 2.6%, including a drop of 20.17  points on Thursday. For the week, the Dow lost 45.18 points.  </P> <P> Investors also may be pulling some money out of stocks and putting it into  short-term bonds, which are yielding close to 9%.  </P> <P> "When you can earn a risk-free 8.5% in Treasury bills, why break your back to  try to get 12% in the market?" said Peter G. Eliades, publisher and editor of  Stockmarket Cycles, a Los Angeles newsletter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Light Volume Cited  </P> <P> Analysts differed on whether the market would soon resume its upward advance,  or whether more declines were ahead. But some bullish experts took heart in the  fact that volume was relatively light.  </P> <P> "There wasn't a stampede to get out of everything," said Donna Hostetler,  director of research at the Los Angeles brokerage of Crowell, Weedon &amp; Co.  She noted that prices for smaller stocks did not fall quite as much as the blue  chip Dow industrials.  </P> <P> She also contended that stocks are still fairly valued by historical standards,  noting that the price-earnings ratio (relation of stock prices to earnings per  share) on the Dow was around 10, about half the levels before the October,  1987, crash. Also, pension funds and other institutional investors are still  holding high levels of cash, she said.  </P> <P> With such factors, "it's hard to get terribly negative," Hostetler said.  </P> <P> But other market watchers contended that the market may have seen its best days  for awhile. While stocks may rebound somewhat next week, prices overall are  overvalued, newsletter editor Eliades said.  </P> <P> He noted that the Dow as a whole is selling at about 2.3 times its book value  (the net worth of all the companies in the index). The Dow has reached those  levels only twice in the past 60 years, once in 1928-29 and again in 1986-87,  both periods just preceding a crash, he contended. A ratio of 1.5 is more  normal, he added.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Broad Market Decline  </P> <P> "We are at or approaching a major top," Eliades said, adding that he had  instructed his subscribers on Thursday to get out of the market.  </P> <P> As far as the performance of individual NYSE issues Friday, 301 stocks rose,  1,233 fell and 446 were unchanged.  </P> <P> Losers among blue chips included International Business Machines, down 53 3/4;  General Electric, down 3/4 at 46 3/4; American Express, down 1 1/4 at 30, and  Philip Morris, down 1 3/4 at 107 1/2.  </P> <P> But Eastman Kodak, which has discussed cost-cutting plans, managed a 5/8 gain  to 48 3/8.  </P> <P> Williams Cos. dropped 1 to 30 7/8. The company reported a $16.1-million loss  for the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> V Band climbed 1 7/8 to 10 1/4 in the over-the-counter market. Thomas Feil, the  company's chairman, said he might consider an offer for the company's stock in  public hands.  </P> <P> As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000 actively traded  stocks, the market lost $31.94 billion, or 1.09% in value.  </P> <P> The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks dropped 2.12 to  164.01.  </P> <P> Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.90 to 337.26, and S&amp;P's  500-stock composite index was down 4.04 at 292.02.  </P> <P> The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market skidded 4.02 to  402.37. At the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index closed at  322.77, down 2.59.  </P> <P> The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed mixed in active trading Friday after a late  rally propelled the Nikkei index to its sixth consecutive record high and  seventh straight gain. The 225-share index rose 53.56 points to close at  32,131.99.  </P> <P> Prices fell sharply on the London Stock Exchange for the second consecutive day  in what was described as a technical correction after the market's sharp surge  of recent weeks. The Financial Times 100-share index closed down 23.0 points at  2,056.1.  </P></p>

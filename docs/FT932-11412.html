			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / Survey of Flanders (8): Ideas spark in smoke - The minister-president is a soccer-loving democrat THE minister-president of the Flemish government since January 1992 is - like Belgium's prime minister, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene - a soccer-loving Christian Democrat. But where Mr Dehaene has dominated the headlines since taking over at the head of the national government in March 1992, Mr Luc Van den Brande appeared to be making little impact at the head of the Flemish government until early this year. People wondered why the workaholic former minister for unemployment and labour, who only stopped generating ideas when he was lighting another cigarette, was still in the shadow of his Walloon counterpart, Mr Guy Spitaels. The answer seems to be that he was busy generating ideas, but waiting for the right moment to unleash them In January Mr Van den Brande turned up the heat in the debate over constitutional reform by telling a Francophone newspaper that he saw the reforms as a stepping stone to a 'confederal' Belgium, in which the state would act as a mere go-between for the regions. His comments were immediately interpreted by anxious Walloons as a thinly veiled call for Flemish independence. When, in March, the Flemish minister-president launched the project 'Vlaanderen-Europa 2002' - an ambitious strategy paper for the development of 'a new Flanders in Europe' - it was taken as further evidence of the radicalisation of Luc Van den Brande. The 47-year-old lawyer is no nationalist firebrand. Directly elected regional parliaments, increased autonomy - especially the ability to sign treaties with other countries - and more fiscal and financial responsibility for the regions, are the key aspects of the latest reform programme as far as he is concerned. Like Dehaene, he welcomes the fact that constitutional reform in Belgium has been 'a democratic evolution' rather than a revolution. But he firmly believes that evolution has not yet stopped. 'I never said we intended to have a fully independent Flanders, according to international law,' he protests, evidently fed up with questions about his confederalist ambitions, but he adds: 'By the end of this century, the most important decision-making powers will be the Flemish and Walloon governments.' By then, Mr Van den Brande forecasts there will be three essential decision-making levels within the European Community: local authorities, the regions, and Europe itself. Belgium will remain, but mainly as a co-ordinator of European affairs, economic and monetary policy, justice and defence responsibilities. 'I'm convinced that 80 to 85 per cent of the Flemings want to do things together with the Walloon part of the country,' he says, 'but based on their own powers, fiscal and financial responsibilities.' Since January he has not been slow to assert these points, looking beyond the immediate political and economic situation to what the future might hold. The Flanders-Europe project is supposed to galvanise the rest of the Flemish population in the same way. 'It's not always clear to Flemings that they must have a broader view and long-term strategy.' Mr Van den Brande has hedged his bets somewhat by making clear that Flanders-Europe is merely a discussion document to be fleshed out through debate across Flanders and beyond. But whether down-to-earth Flemings will go along with this long-term vision remains to be seen. Many, it seems, would prefer him to devote his energies to short-term economic problems. As for the French speakers, they cannot decide whether Luc Van den Brande is a lightweight political opportunist or a dangerous visionary. The Walloons are well aware that 2002 is not only the 10th anniversary of the single European market and Maastricht - the point Mr Van den Brande tends to stress. It is also the 700th anniversary of the Battle of the Golden Spurs, at which the ordinary townspeople of Flanders soundly defeated the French.</p>

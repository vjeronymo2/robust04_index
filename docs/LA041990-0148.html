			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> BOARD RECOMMENDS FREEDOM FOR AWARD-WINNING PRISON JOURNALIST  </P> <P> The Louisiana Pardon Board on Wednesday recommended that Wilbert Rideau, a  convicted murderer who became an award-winning journalist behind bars, be set  free after 29 years in prison.  </P> <P> The final decision will be made by Gov. Buddy Roemer, who has cited the  viciousness of Rideau's crimes in refusing to commute his life sentence in the  past.  </P> <P> After Wednesday's decision, Roemer said he had no plans to do so now.  </P> <P> "It's difficult, I wish I had an easy answer. But my inclination is not to  accept their recommendation," the governor said.  </P> <P> The five-member board voted unanimously to reduce the 48-year-old prison  magazine editor's sentence to 55 years, which defense attorney Julian Murray  said would qualify him for immediate release.  </P> <P> "This is the same recommendation this board made in 1988," said board  chairwoman Yvonne Campbell. "It was based on his prison record, his  accomplishments, and he has only had one write-up in his 29 years in prison."  </P> <P> Two board members also recommended that Rideau be required to leave the state  permanently, contribute part of the earnings from his writing to a victims'  reparation fund and be ordered to perform some community service.  </P> <P> Rideau was sentenced to death for the 1961 murder of a bank teller in an armed  robbery. His sentence was commuted to life in 1973 when the U.S. Supreme Court  overturned the death penalty.  </P> <P> Some argued against clemency.  </P> <P> Rick Bryant, an assistant prosecutor in Calcasieu Parish, called the  premeditated robbery and murder one of the most heinous ever in the parish.  </P> <P> "I've spoken with people who are still terrified of Wilbert Rideau," Bryant  said. "We do believe Mr. Rideau has received his clemency. He's not dead."  </P></p>

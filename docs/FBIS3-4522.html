Not long ago, a  White House official complained: "As long as the Whitewater  case can be driven out of the first page of the newspapers, any  bad news can now be regarded as good news."    An interesting fact was that on 17 March 1992, that is, two  years ago, THE NEW YORK TIMES published a report on the event,  but the report aroused no attention like a stone dropping into  the sea. In late 1992, when Clinton and Bush contended for the  presidency, the Department of Justice turned down the proposal  of the department concerned on investigating the case for fear  that this might be used by the Bush administration. In July  1993, Vincent Foster, deputy counsel to the president on legal  affairs who was in the know, suddenly committed suicide, and the  relevant materials in his hands disappeared without a trace. At  that moment, the case just stirred up some ripples. Five months  ago, a reporter talked about his investigation of the  "Whitewater incident" at a banquet in Washington, but the  subject was still discussed by very few people. How come the  "Whitewater incident" changed from minor ripples into monstrous  waves in the spring?    "Whitewater" is the name of a business company. Fifteen  years ago, Clinton and his wife, together with Mr and Mrs  McDougal who later became Clinton's political ally, set up the  Whitewater Development Corporation on the banks of Whitewater  River in Arkansas, and the company was mainly engaged in trading  idle real estate. In September 1991, Whitewater applied for  bankruptcy after incurring business losses. The "Whitewater  incident" was thus named after the company, and the incident  itself developed into an extremely complicated  economic-political case. The scope of investigation extended to  Clinton's personal life as governor of Arkansas State for 12  years and his wife Hillary's main economic activities as well as  Clinton's personal involvement in such activities. At present,  it does not seem important to find out whether the Clintons  underpaid Whitewater Corporation income taxes, and people have  also paid less attention to the financial details of the case.  People's interest is now focused on the conclusion: Did the  Clintons use the influence of Bill Clinton's governorship to  illegally transfer any funds of a state-run savings and loan  bank to Whitewater Corporation for real estate investment? Was  any money from the bank used to repay Clinton's $50,000 debt he  owed when campaigning for the governorship, thus causing losses  to taxpayers in Arkansas? Was any government loan offered  through a certain company, or was any favorable administrative  decision made in exchange for funds for campaigning for the  governorship and the presidency? In one word, did the Clintons  abuse their official power in pursuit of private gains?    A major reason the "Whitewater incident" was highlighted by  the press in such a frenzied way was that almost everyone made  his or her own vague conjecture about this enigma.    This year is a Congressional by-election year. The  Republican Party hopes to make a comeback, so it is taking  advantage of this case to make an uproar in order to add fuel to  the flames and to damage Clinton's reputation. Clinton and many  leading Democrats angrily call the Whitewater incident a  "Republican conspiracy." On the other hand, while promising to  give "full cooperation," the White House still tried to  equivocate and pry into the process of investigation. Many  political allies and long-time cronies were forced to quit  government posts one after another. In addition, some  Democrats' intention of drawing a "line of demarcation" between  the Democratic Party and Clinton, the different assessments of  Clinton's performances and administrative principles inside the  Democratic Party, the resentment of the East Coast forces  against the upstarts from the West spreading in the White House  and inside D.C., and the different comments of voters about  Hillary's role as both First Lady and major policy-maker  responsible for formulating the increasingly controversial  medical-care reform program..., all played a certain role in  increasing the seriousness of the "Whitewater incident."    Recently, the Senate and the House of Representatives passed  a motion on holding separate Congressional hearings on the  "Whitewater incident" by a unanimous vote and by an overwhelming  majority respectively. Clinton also agreed to make public his  tax returns between 1977 and 1979. Fiske, the special federal  counsel responsible for handling the case, is busy issuing  summons to more and more senior government officials. If the  conclusion is "yes," Clinton will become another Nixon and  "Whitewater" will really wash the White House away. The recent  opinion poll showed that in a period of one month, Clinton's  support declined by 11 percentage points; and this also showed  that the American people believed there are no waves without  wind.</p>

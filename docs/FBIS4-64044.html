			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Karmalito] </F>   [Text] Simferopol May 26 TASS -- The Crimean local  parliament's first session resumed its work on Thursday by  electing Crimean representatives to a joint working group, which  is to prepare agreed-upon proposals for the Ukrainian and  Crimean parliaments.    The working group is being set up under a decision taken as  a  result of the Kiev talks earlier this week between Ukrainian and  Crimean plenipotentiary parliamentary delegations. The group  will include five Crimean lawmakers, as well as four experts in  law.    At the same time, the Crimean parliamentarians postponed at  least until tomorrow debates on the issue of suspending, for the  period of the group's activities, the acts passed by parliament  on May 20, 1994.    The session, which ajourned last week after passing a law  "On  Restoration of Consitutional Foundations of the Crimean  Republic's Statehood", is due to approve a new Crimean  Government named by President Yuriy Meshkov. Lawmakers will  also discuss a programme for pulling the peninsula out of the  current economic crisis and for stabilizing its agro-industrial  complex, as well as endorse a series of presidential decrees.    The session is proceeding in a quiet and businesslike  atmosphere. Passions outside the parliament building calmed  down. A mere several dozens of demonstrators still go on  picketing under slogans demanding for greater independence for  the Crimean republic.</p>

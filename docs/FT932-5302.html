			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Letter: Rewarding subject for study Sir, We are amazed to find, having read the story 'Delors orders study into EC's unemployment crisis' (May 13), that among the areas to be included there is no mention of the policy of high interest rate pursued by the Bundesbank and followed by other European monetary system members. We believe this policy to be one of the major, if not the major, cause of unemployment in the EC. We believe including this subject into the study would be rewarding. Franco Modigliani, institute professor emeritus, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Alfred P Sloan School of Management, Cambridge, Massachusetts, US, and on behalf of: Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, Paul Krugman, Olivier Blanchard</p>

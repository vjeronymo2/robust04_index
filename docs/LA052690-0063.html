			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD EXECUTIONS BE ON TELEVISION?  </P> <P> Two articles in the May 19 Times, when juxtaposed, reveal the incongruities in  our social values and standards. The first was Rosenberg's, in which he wrote  "the public has the right -- perhaps even the obligation -- to watch" televised  executions.  </P> <P> The second dealt with Culver City school officials banning the story of "Little  Red Riding Hood" because some believe the version in question may encourage  children to drink.  </P> <P> What bizarre social values do we express when we would ban a fairy tale because  it allegedly encourages the drinking of alcohol and yet we would consider  televising the execution of a human being?  </P> <P> Will state-sponsored executions supplant the lottery as the most popular form  of government-sponsored entertainment while the state surreptitiously censors  books it sees as detrimental to society?  </P> <P> ARCH MILLER  </P> <P> Arcadia  </P></p>

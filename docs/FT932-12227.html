			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Arts: ENO's new team launches season The incoming artistic team of English National Opera - general director Dennis Marks, music director Sian Edwards - launched on Monday the 1993-4 season, the first such programme to be presented under their leadership, writes Max Loppert. According to Marks, they did so in a spirit of 'confidence and adventure', and in spite of the Pounds 2 million deficit likely to be inherited as a result of this season's box-office slump. Seat prices will almost all be held to current levels (with new plans for half-price tickets for children). The choice of new productions, seven in all, has been made with the purpose of inaugurating what Marks calls a 'period of renewal'. Repertory favourites  -La Boheme, Der Rosenkavalier, Cosi fan tutte - account for three of these; the others are Lohengrin (the first Wagner at the Coliseum for eight years), Smetana's Two Widows, Janacek's Jenufa, and the world premiere of Judith Weir's Blond Eckbert. Der Rosenkavalier will mark the return to the house of Jonathan Miller as producer, and Anne Evans (Marschallin) and John Tomlinson (Ochs) among the cast. There will be revivals of Simon Boccanegra - which opens the season on August 26 - Weill's Street Scene, Britten's Lucretia and Grimes, Barber of Seville, Figaro, Fledermaus, Xerxes, Falstaff, Pearl Fishers and Onegin. Conductors for the season include two Russian ENO debutants, Yakov Kreizberg and Alexander Polianichko, Andrew Litton, Mark Elder, David Atherton and Edwards herself.</p>

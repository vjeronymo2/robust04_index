			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Survey of Risk Management (6): The art of planning for a disaster - Contingency planning The extensive damage, injury and death caused by terrorist bomb explosions in New York, London, Northern Ireland, Milan, and elsewhere provide the most pointed lessons in the need for contingency planning. However, the discipline is relevant not only to such high profile events, but also to the management of any incident which affects continuity of business. Threats arise from many diverse sources, including: fire, flood, or storm; employee fraud or negligence; computer virus; a health alert (perhaps a case of legionnaire's disease); or injury to key staff. Even seemingly prosaic events, such as loss of a corporate stationery storage facility through fire, can disrupt a business. A threat might be posed by an incident which strikes a supplier, affecting its ability to deliver key components. As Chris Chandler, of Continuity Planning Associates, says: 'Our definition of a disaster is any unplanned occurrence which seriously affects an organisation's ability to trade.' A recent British Bankers' Association (BBA) guidance note, Surviving a Disaster, asserts: 'Contingency planning is essential, not optional, and should be budgeted for accordingly.' This sentiment is equally applicable to all business sectors. However, evidence suggests that such advice has yet not been fully heeded. In 1993, Keith Hearnden, a lecturer in security management at Loughborough University, surveyed the ability of organisations' contingency plans to cope with a disaster striking computer systems. Based on 421 responses his analysis shows that, while awareness of the need for contingency planning is high, in practice plan implementation, scope and effectiveness often leave much to be desired. The survey results indicated that 43 per cent of respondents had no contingency plan, 20 per cent had untested plans, and 15 per cent had 'doubtful' plans. Just 22 per cent had contingency plans that were termed 'viable.' The overall figures hide wide variations between industry sectors. For example, viable plans were found among 63 per cent of gas, electricity and water utilities, but only 14 per cent of local authorities and computer services businesses (such as software houses and systems bureaux). In publishing these results, IBM UK noted: 'The research paints a gloomy picture of the viability of recovery plans in British organisations.' IBM's report adds: 'Many so-called business recovery plans stay in the IT department.' Information technology systems are increasingly important given the widespread distribution of computing power throughout organisations. However, a focus on IT systems, or any other individual operational area, is unlikely to lead to effective contingency planning. As Charles Shaw, director of business continuity consultancy at Safetynet, says: 'Having a plan solely for an IT department is like having a fire escape half way down the side of a building.' Leo Gibbons, associate director of Sedgwick Bankrisk, agrees: 'Contingency plans must address the effect of an incident on the continuity of the business as a whole. For example, having a hot-site standby computer facility up and running within a few hours may not be of much use if the appropriate staff, command structure and communication links are not in place.' However, in recent years computer disaster recovery services have broadened their scope and are now largely indistinguishable from contingency planning, or business continuity planning, disciplines which have developed in a wider risk management context. In its guide to disaster recovery action planning, MRC Business Information Group notes the change in emphasis: 'In the past such planning has focused on computer installations. (Now it must deal) with the many aspects of organisational life: management, personnel, insurance, communications, buildings and building services.' However, as the Loughborough University results highlight, the application of broader contingency planning is not widespread. Mr Gibbons says that, apart from a focus on IT, other factors which can make contingency plans less than fully effective include: 'Lack of testing or staff training, failure to regularly audit plans to make sure they address changing threats, and too little attention being paid to longer term recovery.' Often the initial imperative which pulls an organisation together during a disastrous incident is difficult to sustain after a few months. An extreme example of plan failure followed the Bishopsgate bomb in the City of London in April 1993. One City firm found that it was unable to implement its contingency plan because the sole copy was in the senior partner's safe in a building within an area cordoned-off by police. Andrew King, who as director of loss adjusters Thomas Howell Group has first-hand experience of numerous disastrous incidents, notes four implications of such an event: 'It arrives suddenly and is unanticipated; it poses novel problems in which the enterprise has little prior experience; failure to respond implies either a critical financial reversal or loss of a significant opportunity; and the response must be urgent and cannot be handled promptly by normal business systems and procedure.' Contingency planning involves developing and implementing systems and procedures to enable that response to be made. It requires high-level commitment. Mr Shaw points out that Safetynet's contingency planning consultancy requires a client to appoint an 'executive sponsor' to guarantee its commitment to the project. As MRC's Mr Fleming says: 'Contingency planning must have the commitment of the senior management of an organisation. Those involved in a business, who know it best, must formulate their own contingency planning. A consultant cannot do it for them, but can catalyse and help direct the planning process.' Contingency planning involves more than simply writing a plan. Mr Gibbons says: 'Four phases are required: Review of hazards facing an organisation, and assessment of their potential business impacts; Development, maintenance, auditing, and testing of the contingency plans; Crisis management - implementation of plans during an incident and its immediate aftermath; Recovery to normal business operations.' It is important that the first two phases are revisited regularly: hazards and their potential impacts will change over time, and contingency plans must evolve in response. As Mr King says: 'The plans must be living documents that reflect changes in the business environment.' Often the outcome of the planning process will be a series of plans relating to departments or operational areas, managed within the context of an overall strategic plan. In the event of a crisis developing, the contingency plans will detail the make-up of recovery teams and the tasks that need to be carried out. Employees need to be informed and directed. Key services must be maintained, and alternative or stand-by facilities brought on line where needed. Communication with customers and suppliers is essential, as is handling of the media. In a high profile incident, the reputation of a company may rest on the comments made by spokespersons. Contingency planning is applicable regardless of the size of an organisation, or its field of business. Numerous sources of advice and assistance are available. Insurers, insurance brokers, risk consultants, loss adjusters, loss assessors, and chartered surveyors all provide consultancy on contingency planning and the use of third-party recovery services. Specialist consultants in the field include: Continuity Planning Associates (CPA), Safetynet, Comdisco Disaster Recovery Services (CDRS), IBM Business Recovery Services, Datashield, Computer Disaster Recovery, MRC, Safetynet, and Stralis among many others. Some provide software products to assist clients with the contingency planning process: RecoveryPAC from CPA, ComPAS from CDRS, Crisis] from Richmond Risk Management, and TRPS from Ai Cambridge, for example. It is too late to address contingency planning after a crisis has occurred. As Mr King says: 'No-one plans to fail, they just fail to plan.'</p>

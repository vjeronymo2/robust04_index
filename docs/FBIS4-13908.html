			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Telephone interview with Ahmad Quray', PLO's Economic </F> Department head, in Paris, by Sa'id Mu'addi in the studio; date  not given; from the "With the Events" program -- recorded]    [Text] [Mu'addi] In contrast to the headway the political  talks in Cairo are making, the economic talks in Paris seem to  be slowing up. Are the differences substantive and of the kind  that may preclude a final agreement?    [Quray'] Slowing up may be too strong a word and would  suggest there is deliberate foot dragging, which is not the  case. We are striving to hammer out an agreement. However,  there are key issues that must be thrashed out. Take, for  instance, the value added tax, which should not, under any  circumstances, be as high as that levied in Israel. We  proposed, and Israel rejected, a compromise of 15 percent.  There is also the question of the tax deducted from Arab  workers, which, incidentally, I don't think is an insurmountable  hurdle, since there seems to be an inclination to reimburse the  Palestinian authority. There is the more weighty issue of  import policies. Israel wants to keep the same customs policies  that are in force now under the occupation regime. We are  interested in istituting cooperation with Israel, but without  the continued Israeli domination of the Palestinian economy.  The Palestinians must enjoy free and independent  decisionmaking. In this area, we proposed a reasonable formula  which they have rejected. We drew up a list of goods the  Palestinian authority would import from the Arab markets, but we  have not been able to work out an agreement. For us, this is an  important issue, since we are a part of the Arab world. Our  strategic heartland is Arab, and so we cannot have a one-way  relationship with the Arabs, exporting to them without importing  from them. That was a particularly delicate issue.    [Mu'addi] How is it that economic issues are posing a hurdle  to an agreement, after the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations have  come that far?    [Quray'] Important as the other negotiations are, I think  that, outside the security concerns, economic issues are the  most important. Security and economics are the mainstay of the  interim period. If we have kept the media at bay and failed to  report on our economic talks on a daily basis, this has not been  to belittle them. I regard the economic talks the more  important of the two sets of negotiations. We are not talking  here just about Gaza and Jericho; the talks are about the entire  interim stage covering the areas of industry, agriculture,  tourism, finance, and banking. Taken as a whole, these issues  are highly important and must receive the attention they merit.    [Mu'addi] Back to the Cairo talks, is 4 May a definite date  for signing the Israeli-Palestinian agreement?    [Quray'] I cannot be so specific. I think, though, early  May should see the Declaration of Principles put in place. The  two sides are determined that this happen.    [Mu'addi] Thank you.    [Quray'] Thank you.</p>

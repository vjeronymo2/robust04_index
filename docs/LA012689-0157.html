			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GUYS &amp; GALLEYS: YOU CAN'T PREPARE TOO MUCH  </P> <P> "Always cook too much because even that won't be enough." That's the theory on  which Israel Paskowitz operates in the kitchen.  </P> <P> It was formulated, he says, from being raised in the sprawling and  internationally known surfing family of Juliet and Dr. Dorian Paskowitz (there  are nine children in all: eight boys and one girl).  </P> <P> "Somebody was always late, and when they did show up, they'd have someone with  them," says Israel, 24. "Or the first ones to eat were hungry again, so there  had to be plenty of food."  </P> <P> The problem is it's a habit he can't seem to get out of, even though he's  married and cooking for only himself and wife Danielle.  </P> <P> "She's always kidding me about the amount of food I prepare, only sometimes I'm  not sure she's kidding."  </P> <P> Paskowitz, the surfing world's reigning long-board champion and an aspiring  actor and model,does all the cooking on the couple's San Juan Capistrano ranch,  which they share with three horses, two dogs and a cat.  </P> <P> "Danielle never learned to cook," he says, "and we decided when we got married  about 1 1/2 years ago that it made sense for me to just do it, that neither of  us wanted to eat lousy food for a couple of years until she learned."  </P> <P> Being the son of a nutrition-conscious doctor has left him a "bit of a fanatic"  on what he prepares, he says. "Lots of salads, vegetables, fresh fruits, fish,  chicken, stuff like that." And he likes to bake his own bread.  </P> <P> A favorite chicken dish is the one he shared with Guys &amp; Galleys. "It's a  bit unorthodox with the boiling and then baking, but it's great -- and there's  lots of it," he says.  </P> <P> Each week, Orange County Life will feature a man who enjoys cooking and will  publish one of his favorite recipes.

Clean chickens thoroughly and place in pot.  Cover and simmer for about 45 minutes. While chicken is cooking, place stuffing  mix in bowl. Lightly saute onions in the butter, then add to stuffing along  with celery, salt, pepper and garlic. In separate pan, boil 2 cups water and  add livers. Simmer about 15 minutes, then add livers and water they cooked in  to the stuffing mix. Blend well. Fill sink with cold water and soak chickens  for about 10 minutes in the water after they have cooked. Preheat oven to 375  degrees, stuff chickens and roast uncovered for about 30 minutes. Place several  sliced yams around chicken while roasting.  </P> <P> ISRAEL  </P></p>

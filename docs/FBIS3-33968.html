A technical cooperation and coordination accord between the  two countries was signed. It aims to promote Lebanese-Cypriot  relations in posts and communications and the services linked to  them.    Minister Ghaziri announced the formation of a technical  committee comprised of Lebanese and Cypriots to draft an  agreement on laying an undersea communications axial fiber cable  between the two countries. He added that efforts are under way  to extend an undersea cable with a capacity of 8000 axial lines.  The first phase will begin with 4000 lines, of which Syria will  have 16 percent with the remainder shared equally between  Lebanon and Cyprus.

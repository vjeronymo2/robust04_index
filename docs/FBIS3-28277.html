			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ryuzo Sejima, former chairman of the </F> Consultative Committee for Strengthening Diplomacy, by AERA  editorial staff Hidetoshi Sotooka; place and date not given]    [Text] [Sotooka] Last August, the Foreign Ministry  started to strengthen its intelligence ability in response to  recommendations made by the consultative committee which you  chaired. What were the recommendations' aim and background?    [Sejima] After the end of the Cold War, the world witnessed  the breakout of the Persian Gulf war and a series of isolated  conflicts and faced a number of tasks such as environmental and  human rights problems. The world has entered an era of  multipolarization and diversification. In Japan, meanwhile, the  bubble economy has continued to burst and domestic politics and  economy have gone into a period of instability. With these as  the background, my basic understanding was that there was a need  to strengthen the diplomatic power.    As a way to invigorate the Foreign Ministry, to begin with,  it was proposed to strengthen its international intelligence  ability, its capability to draw up comprehensive foreign  policies and functions of diplomatic establishments abroad, and,  at the same time, to increase the number of diplomatic personnel  by 1,000 in several years. Although I tackled the  administrative reform problem aiming for a slim government, I  had a different idea about the Foreign Ministry, feeling that  the present status would not do.    [Sotooka] Do you mean that the present intelligence  capabilities are insufficient?    [Sejima] For example, the number of Foreign Ministry  personnel is half that of the United Kingdom and one-third that  of the United States. A young diplomat in charge of an area  covers eight countries by himself. As things are, it is  impossible to cover the whole world. Diplomatic establishments  abroad are still dependent on an outdated communications system.  That has to be modernized. Furthermore, collection and analysis  of information at the ministry proper lacked coordination  because they were handled vertically from the bottom up.  Coordination is indispensable to intelligence capabilities.    [Sotooka] What international intelligence capability does  Japan need?    [Sejima] A nation's intelligence power is dependent on four  factors. The first is that a nation is not internationally  isolated. It has to have more allied and friendly nations. The  second is that close relations should be firmly established  between the Foreign Ministry bureau that handles information and  other government agencies. The third is that intelligence  capability at diplomatic establishments abroad should be  superior in both quality and quantity and it has to supplement  private intelligence. The fourth is that a network of  international communications should be firmly established.    Japan's diplomatic response was superb before and after the  Russo-Japanese War. When the war became inevitable, Japan  signed the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty, posted an envoy in  the United States early enough to feel out the possibility of  U.S. intervention when the time for ending the war came, and  dispatched Korekiyo Takahashi in Europe to raise money for war  expenditures. Immediately after the victory at the Battle of  Mukden, war termination was sought. However, in World War II,  Japan was isolated internationally because it had withdrawn from  the League of Nations and its intelligence capabilities were  extraordinarily weak. Weak intelligence capabilities were  apparent in the fact that Japan overestimated the strength of  Germany and Italy, while it underestimated that of the United  States and the United Kingdom.    [Sotooka] It is feared that strengthening intelligence  capabilities will lead to big power status.    [Sejima] There is no need to be aware of big or small power.  Even if a nation wants to be a small power, it is necessary to  strengthen its intelligence capabilities. During World War II,  I took special note of information in countries between the  Soviet Union and Germany, such as Finland, Sweden, and Poland.  Their information was highly reliable, because their national  existence depended on the information.    [Sotooka] What is your understanding of relations between  national security and intelligence?    [Sejima] Japan has to maintain national security and the  lives of the people and it is important for Japan to become a  nation that can be trusted by the world.    On the average over the past 20 years, Japan has been  importing 600 million tons of resources and raw materials  annually and exporting 70 million tons of products that have  competitive power. The nation's foundation rests on peaceful  exchanges with the world. Without winning the trust of others,  both imports of 600 million tons and exports of 70 million tons  cannot be carried out successfully.    Japan's foundation rests on peace and diligence.  Realistically speaking, I think that Japan should be a  defense-oriented nation. It has a wonderful peace Constitution  and it requires little national investment for armaments. In  the present world, a military offensive operation demands  nuclear weapons, but I am against possessing nuclear arms.    Meanwhile, in mankind's history of war, a defense-oriented  nation won a war only when its intelligence capabilities  excelled. There has never been a case of passively winning a  war. Information must be obtained to maintain independence.    Speaking of the people as a whole, their regard for  information is still low, I think.    [Sotooka] Please define intelligence capabilities from the  standpoint of your work in intelligence from the wartime to the  post-war period.    [Sejima] Intelligence capabilities has four processes,  namely, collection, judgment of reliability, judgment of  situation, and response. In the collection stage, a certain  amount of information is required. However, the most important  is how the situation is assessed. If affected by response and  favor, judgment will become blurred. When I worked in the field  of drawing up military operations, situations tended to be  judged in favor of responses, in the end. At the consultation  meeting, such ideas as setting up an independent organization  and training 10,000 intelligence officers were introduced.    However, a government must be slim and it is doubtful  whether  increased quantity of information will do. After all, personnel  increases would be a waste. In other words, whether calm and  thoroughgoing judgment can be made or not depends on the quality  of the people in charge.</p>

			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WEST GERMANY ORDERS DIPLOMATS OUT OF KABUL;  </P> <P> FOOD SHORTAGES, RISK OF REBEL ATTACK HELP PROMPT BONN'S ACTION  </P> <P> West Germany's diplomatic staff left Kabul on Saturday under orders from the  Bonn government, and Tass said the Soviet Union began an airlift of emergency  food supplies to the beleaguered capital.  </P> <P> The West German Foreign Ministry said it told its three diplomats in Kabul to  leave because of fears of worsening economic conditions and increased violence  as Soviet soldiers leave Afghanistan.  </P> <P> Juergen Chrobog, chief ministry spokesman in Bonn, said the diplomats and their  families left Saturday and that the embassy will function "on a reduced status"  with a small local staff.  </P> <P> Western diplomatic sources in Kabul, however, said the embassy was closed. That  would make it the first foreign mission in Kabul to shut down amid concerns  about an economic blockade and possible blood bath after the departure of  Soviet troops, expected to be completed next month.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Flight to New Delhi  </P> <P> The sources said the West Germans left on a flight for New Delhi with no  advance announcement.  </P> <P> Other Western embassies say they are reviewing their positions now that it  appears the Soviets will meet the Feb. 15 deadline for removal of their troops  from Afghanistan, where they have been helping government troops fight Muslim  guerrillas since December, 1979.  </P> <P> The British Embassy last week told Britons and nationals of six other countries  for which it has diplomatic responsibility to leave. The U.S. Embassy has 11  American staff members in Kabul and says the question of whether to stay is  "under constant review."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tensions Increase  </P> <P> Kabul has been increasingly tense as the withdrawal date for the remaining  50,000 Soviet soldiers approaches and guerrillas close in. Food prices have  doubled in recent weeks. Civilians, including young children, stand in bread  lines for hours in 20-degree temperatures.  </P> <P> Departing Soviet military forces leave behind a regime stockpiling ammunition  for a battle of survival with the guerrillas, who ring the capital in mountain  bases and have rejected proposals for a political settlement.  </P> <P> Guerrilla disruptions of convoys of food and supplies, including ammunition,  have increased as Soviet troops hand over escort duties and positions to  government units along the key Salang Highway from the Soviet border. Bad  weather also has held up convoys.  </P> <P> Saturday's English-language Tass report mentioned "significant shortages  because of the effort by the unreconcilable opposition (guerrillas) to organize  an economic blockade of the city." It accused some Kabul traders of engaging in  "open sabotage" by hoarding food.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Food Airlift Begins  </P> <P> The official Soviet news agency reported from Kabul that a 3,500-ton airlift of  food began Friday. Tass said six flights arrived Saturday in Kabul with flour  and other food supplies.  </P> <P> U.N. aid officials welcomed the reported airlift and urged similar help from  Western nations, which refuse to deal with the pro-Marxist government of  President Najibullah.  </P> <P> "We're very pleased. This is a beginning," said Vincent O'Reilly, head of  UNICEF in Kabul.  </P> <P> "We've heard reports of children dying (from cold) in the bread queues, and  we're very concerned about the dangers of increased malnutrition. . . . This is  a humanitarian, not a political issue, and the West should help too."  </P> <P> Kabul's daily life has become a tableau of war, suffering, fear and efforts to  escape. Amputees hobble in the potholed streets. Afghans cluster at the Indian  Embassy for visas.  </P> <P> The bitter Afghan winter is even harder to bear because of the scarcity of food  and fuel caused partly by guerrilla attacks on convoys along the Salang  Highway.  </P> <P> Giant Soviet transports drop cascades of anti-missile flares as they climb from  the Kabul airport, bound for Moscow with soldiers and civilian advisers after  delivering cargoes of ammunition.  </P> <P> An average of six planes arrive and depart daily. Hundreds of fully equipped  Soviet troops have been seen boarding them.  </P> <P> North of the Salang Pass toward the border, Soviet troops are digging in at new  positions, diplomats say, apparently to secure the road for the final  withdrawal.  </P> <P> Workers in Kabul are felling an avenue of trees and leveling the ground on  either side of a long, wide road that runs from the Darulaman Palace,  headquarters of the Defense Ministry, past the Soviet Embassy.  </P> <P> It is wide enough to accommodate small Antonov transport planes, and there is  speculation that the Soviets are preparing an emergency airstrip.  </P> <P> Indications are that thousands of Afghans, including supporters or  beneficiaries of the current regime, are trying to slip away or make  arrangements for quick exits.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Visa Section Closed  </P> <P> The U.S. Embassy shut its visa section last month after a deluge of more than  250 applications a day, compared to five a month last year. Since it stopped  issuing visas, lines have formed outside the embassy of India, the nearest  country for those who can afford air fare.  </P> <P> Fur-hatted Soviet troops still man mountainside artillery emplacements on  Kabul's outskirts but have handed over some posts on the perimeter road.  </P> <P> An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in Afghanistan when the withdrawal  began May 15 under a U.N.-mediated agreement signed in Geneva. Half were gone  by Aug. 15.  </P> <P> Some analysts believe the guerrillas, who have reduced rocket attacks on the  capital, are holding off a major assault to let the rest of the Soviets out  during the next few weeks.  </P></p>

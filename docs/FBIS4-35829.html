			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] At a meeting with foreign dignitaries taking part  in the ceremonies marking the fifth anniversary of the death of  His Holiness Imam Khomeyni, may his soul be sanctified, the  president of the Islamic Republic of Iran ['Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani] stressed the need for unity among the world  Muslims.    The president said: The big problem of the world of Islam is  the lack of unity between Muslims. The Islamic Republic of Iran  will do its best to create unity and has reached out the hand of  unity toward all Islamic countries.    According to our correspondent, Mr. Hashemi-Rafsanjani said:  The Islamic Republic of Iran has no intention of interfering in  the internal affairs of any country. We hope Islamic  governments do not interpret our advice as interference in their  domestic affairs.    Referring to the fact that Islamic Iran is very serious in  the country's construction the president said: Our dependence on  the outside world is being reduced every day. What worries us  today is the existence of problems in the world of Islam, such  as in Yemen, Afghanistan, Bosnia, and Palestine.    Stressing that the Islamic revolution has continued on its  course for the past 15 years without any foreign backing, he  said the success and the historical miracle stem from the power  of Islam and the wise leadership of the imam [Khomeyni].    Criticizing certain Islamic governments for mischief-making  against the Islamic revolution, the president said: They intend  to divert toward Iran the opposition of world Muslims to Israel.  That is an astonishing crime and very woeful for the Muslim  world.    The president added: Public opinion in the world of Islam  has  been awakened. We hope that the enemies of Islam will realize  that and cease their mischief-making. [passage omitted]</p>

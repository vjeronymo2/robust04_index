			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Aznar Will Facilitate Gonzalez </F> Departure and Forgoes `Lifting Carpet'"]    [Text] Madrid -- People's Party Chairman Jose Maria Aznar  yesterday showed himself prepared to facilitate an "intelligent  solution" to the country's political situation, so that nobody  -- not even Felipe Gonzalez -- would have to leave their posts  "with their heads bowed or hidden under their wings."    In statements to Antena 3 Radio, Aznar emphasized that he  has  no interest in "looking backward or lifting carpets," but this  did not prevent him from again accusing the Socialist government  and its political allies of being directly responsible for  corruption in Spain.    The People's Party chairman asserted that his sole concern  is  to offer the electorate a blueprint for Spain's future. "We  have no other interest, either in looking backward, or in  lifting carpets, or in the Spanish people's persisting in  distinguishing between one another," he asserted, since his  concern is to turn over a new leaf in Spanish democracy. Aznar  warned that he is not prepared to accept anybody's setting his  personal interest above general interests.    In addition, he stated that he does not believe in the  existence of the so-called captive vote, and asked what message  of hope the Spanish Socialist Workers Party can offer when it is  constantly having recourse to the vote of fear -- an  "irresponsible and intolerable" political strategy aimed at  dividing the Spanish people's votes. Jose Maria Aznar did not  rule out the possibility of submitting a censure motion against  the government after the European elections, once the final  results are known, and reiterated that this political action is  not advisable right now, since he does not have the necessary  parliamentary support.  <H5>  Criticisms of CiU </H5>   In this connection, he criticized CiU [Convergence and  Union]  for exclusively defending its particular party interests,  without heeding those of the country or of Catalonia; a  community in which, according to him, unemployment grew by 30  percent over the past year. "CiU's stance is inexplicable," he  concluded.    The People's Party chairman, who yesterday visited a  rehabilitation center for drug addicts in the Madrid district of  Barajas, stated at the end of the visit that although all the  opinion polls give his party as the winner in the 12 June  European elections, he does not want "the slightest  overconfidence. We have a vital opportunity to try to emerge  from the crisis, and it must not be missed if we wish to  safeguard Spain's future."    Next, he asserted that his party does not intend to  dismantle  the levels of social protection achieved in Spain over the past  few decades, although he emphasized that "they are still below  those of the advanced countries of the European Union," and  stated that his party aims to set under way an "open public  administration that will not stifle social initiatives and will  allow citizens access to education, health, and other quality  services."    With respect to Deputy Prime Minister Narcis Serra's recent  appearance in the Congress [of Deputies], Jose Maria Aznar  asserted that "it is not through stances of entrenchment and  rancor that Spain will move forward," but rather through a  blueprint for the whole country that will offer it a future and  hope, and he identified the People's Party as the only party  that can guarantee those aims today.</p>

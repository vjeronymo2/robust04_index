			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Leading Article: Labouring on THE NEWLY elected leader of the Labour party, Mr John Smith, sounds remarkably like a man who believes that with just a little extra effort on the part of the opposition the Conservatives will be dismissed at the next general election. His acceptance speech on Saturday had the tone of a 'one more heaver', a man not yet ready to entertain the sweeping changes that will have to be made if Labour is to fulfil its primary function of acting as an electable alternative government. Mr Smith did of course talk of change. He touched on many of the issues of immediate concern to the would-be reformers in his party. Labour must appeal to women, he intimated. It must attract the green vote and also address itself to poverty in the developing countries. Constitutional reform will be high on his agenda. There will also be reform of the internal workings of the party, which he accepts can no longer be based on the exercise of the block vote by trade unions. He projected himself as an internationalist, a good European, leader of a party committed to the social chapter rejected by Britain at Maastricht. Perhaps most promisingly for Labour's future chances, he proposed to speak for all the opposition parties, plus disgruntled Tories. Thus the desire to broaden the base of his party's support is clearly there. What is missing is evidence that Mr Smith understands how to set about this daunting task. His appeal to the altruism of middle-class voters reflects a genuine moralistic streak within the Labour movement, but the truth is that successful political parties nearly always reflect the interests of particular groups of supporters. Labour's traditional working-class base is steadily shrinking. It has yet to make headway in the south of England. It must find new ways of appealing to the middle-classes. Nothing that Mr Smith said on his first day as leader gives reason to believe that Labour is ready thus to reposition itself in the marketplace of British politics.</p>

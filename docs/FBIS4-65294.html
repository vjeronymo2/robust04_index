			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Local politicians in northern Sweden  are concerned that they will receive less regional aid than they  had thought under the European Union [EU] accession agreement.  According to a report by Lena Hemmel in the 22 April Swedish  SVENSKA DAGBLADET on page 18, Sweden is earmarked to receive 2.4  billion kronor in regional aid -- 360 million under the  Objective 6 program, and the northern provinces thought that  they were also entitled to seek aid from the other 2 billion.  In what they regard as at best a misunderstanding and at worst  a betrayal, they have now discovered that they are not. A local  politician in the town of Vilhelmina called the accession  agreement "worse than the worst imaginable." He expressed  concern that "there can be other hidden problems that they  [government negotiators] wanted to cover up and that will come  up once the referendum is over and we are already in the  system." Georg Andersson, the former Social Democratic  communication minister and now a member of parliament from the  northern town of Lycksele, said: "This is negative, very  negative...it does not improve the climate of opinion on EU  accession. Many people have placed great weight on regional  policy."</p>

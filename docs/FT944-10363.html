			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / Amato job splits Italy's coalition Mr Giuliano Amato, the former Socialist premier, has been appointed to head Italy's five-man anti-trust commission, the ultimate arbiter of any conflict of interest between the role of Mr Silvio Berlusconi as prime minister and his ownership of the Fininvest financial and media empire. This is the first time the six-month-old Berlusconi government has offered a sensitive appointment to an opposition figure, and the move has divided the rightwing coalition. But, given the unresolved conflict of interest between Mr Berlusconi's political and business roles, the move is a clear attempt to recover credibility. It represents a move by moderates in the government to bring the coalition towards the middle ground and pave the way for an alliance with centrist parties in the opposition with whom Mr Amato identifies. Significantly, the choice of Mr Amato to head the anti-trust commission follows the serious divisions within the rightwing coalition caused by the refusal to nominate Mr Giorgio Napolitano, previous speaker of the chamber of deputies and a member of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), as one of Italy's two new European commissioners. The decision to appoint Mr Amato was formally taken by Ms Irene Pivetti, the speaker of the chamber and member of the populist Northern League; but it was backed by Mr Berlusconi. Yesterday, the move was criticised by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance as well as by individual members of the league and Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement. The appointment comes at a time when the government finds itself running into increasing problems of conflict of interest over the management of the Rai, Italy's troubled state broadcasting organisation. On Tuesday, the government approved the summary removal of Mr Gianni Billia, brought in only 95 days ago to be director-general of the Rai alongside Mrs Letizia Moratti, the new chairman. Mr Billia felt uneasy about Mrs Moratti's management style and the choice of programme and channel managers, several of whom had links to Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader. He also fell out over Mrs Moratti's plans to sell off some of the Rai's transmission facilities which threaten to weaken the role state television could play in developing multimedia activities - and benefiting Mr Berlusconi's three commercial channels that account for almost half the national television audience. At least one other Rai board member has resigned and others could follow.</p>

			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / International Company News: Cost-cutting brings 21% pre-tax gain for Statoil Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, yesterday reported a 21 per cent advance in 1993 pre-tax profits to NKr12bn (Dollars 1.58bn) from NKr9.9bn the previous year, boosted by a reduction in operating costs, improved financial results and a good performance by the securities portfolio. However, the group said it would cut its dividend payment to the state to NKr1.08bn from NKr1.25bn. Group operating revenue rose by NKr6.6bn to NKr81.1bn as operating profit dipped to NKr12.24bn from NKr12.6bn. 'The Statoil group achieved a good result in 1993,' said Mr Harald Norvik, chief executive. 'Production from the fields we operate was good. Efforts to improve recovery from these fields is yielding positive results. Measures by all our business areas to cut costs have also contributed to the good result.' Mr Norvik warned, however, that market developments indicated low prices and narrow margins in 1994. 'As a result, improvement programmes will continue with undiminished vigour to secure the group's competitiveness and long-term profitability,' he pledged. Operating costs in 1993 were NKr68.63bn, against NKr61.95bn, but the group expanded operations last year when a new gas field came on stream, a new pipeline became operational and when several oil fields in which Statoil has substantial shareholdings started producing. Net financial charges were reduced by NKr2bn to NKr700m, reflecting reduced currency losses on long-term debt and securities gains. Net interest expenses were cut by NKr300m in 1993 while currency losses on long-term debt fell to NKr1.7bn from NKr2.3bn. Gains on securities and bonds in 1993 reached NKr500m, against a loss of NKr580m in the previous year. Statoil noted that Brent blend reference crude achieved an average price per barrel of Dollars 17 last year, down from Dollars 19.30 a year earlier. However, in domestic currency terms the price per barrel of crude was NKr1 higher at NKr121. Daily crude oil production slipped to 414,000 barrels a day from 418,000 due to reduced output from the prolific Statfjord field. Group investments rose to NKr13.4bn in 1993 from NKr10.6bn.</p>

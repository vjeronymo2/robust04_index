			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Tories boost fundraising LEADING FIGURES in commerce and industry have been enlisted by the Conservative party to revitalise its fundraising activities. The party's new board of treasurers includes Mr David Sieff, a director of retailer Marks and Spencer, Sir Philip Harris, chairman and chief executive of carpet retailer Carpetright, Mr David Davies, chairman of Johnson Matthey, the materials technology group, Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman of property company Slough Estates, and Mr Anthony Weldon, a director of financial services group NP Record. Mr Charles Hambro, the party's senior treasurer, remains chairman of the board, which also includes two other members of the Tory hierarchy, Sir Malcolm Chaplin and Mr Tim Smith, MP for Beaconsfield and vice-chairman of the party. In the wake of the controversy over the Pounds 400,000 contributed to the party by Mr Asil Nadir, the former Polly Peck chief who jumped bail and fled to northern Cyprus, the team of fundraisers will also have a role in vetting donations. Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, recently wrote to Mr Hambro to 'make it quite clear' that fundraising must be 'independent of any suggestion of political influence'. He reaffirmed yesterday that cuts at Central Office and in the regions had ensured that the party's spending was no longer in excess of income.</p>

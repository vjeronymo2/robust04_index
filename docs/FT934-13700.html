			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The GOLD price recoiled from resistance just below Dollars 369 a troy ounce yesterday afternoon. But after subsiding by nearly Dollars 5 it recovered to close in London at Dollars 367, just 50 cents down on the day. Dealers attributed the retreat to long-liquidation by US investment funds following Monday's rally. PLATINUM ended within Dollars 1.25 of the day's high, closing at Dollars 372 an ounce, after finding support below Dollars 370. The London afternoon fix had been at Dollars 373.25 an ounce, up Dollars 6.30 from the same point on Monday, although dealers noted that there was little physical business being done. At the London Metal Exchange the COPPER market extended its decline, reaching 6-year lows before steadying a little to close at Dollars 1,632.50 for three months metal, down Dollars 25 on the day. The market remained bearish on fundamental and technical grounds, dealers said, and the likelihood was that the price would head for Dollars 1,600 soon. The NICKEL market continued the retreat that has followed the recent rally, the three months price closing another Dollars 95 down at Dollars 4,570 a tonne. But it was still Dollars 440 above the recent 6 3/4  year low. Compiled from Reuters</p>

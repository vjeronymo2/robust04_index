			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Repressive Offensive Against Anti-war Forces" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The Kim Yong-sam  fascist clique recently issued an order to the puppet police  throughout South Korea to hurriedly arrest some 90 leading  members of the South Korean Federation of General Student  Councils (Hanchongnyon) including its chairman, alleging that  "the disposition of Hanchongnyon benefiting the enemy was made  clear."    In this regard, NODONG SINMUN today says this reckless  repressive row kicked up by the Kim Yong-sam group is a  premeditated fascist offensive to suppress and stifle  Hanchongnyon, the vanguard of the anti-war, anti-nuke struggle  for independence, democracy and reunification, and students.    The news analyst says:    The repressive offensive against Hanchongnyon was launched  at  a time when the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique was driving the  situation to the worst phase, letting loose such bellicose  utterances as "tough counteraction," "retaliatory punishment"  and "sanctions" under the pretext of our "nuclear issue."    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique are now serving the  imperialists as a "shockbrigade" in their moves to take  "sanctions" against us over the "nuclear suspicion." They are  also getting overheated in arms buildup and nuclear war  exercises in a bid to fulfil "the new operation plan 5027" they  worked out with outside forces to invade the North.    The reality shows that the Kim Yong-sam group is going to  make a military adventure against us in league with its master,  the United States.    The South Korean puppets intend to suppress the pro-  reunification, patriotic and democratic forces of South Korea  including Hanchongnyon that they consider to be an obstacle to  their criminal moves, thus stamping out the anti-U.S., anti-war,  anti- nuke, anti-"government" forces at a stroke in South Korea.    The Kim Yong-sam group must be mindful that the further it  is  hell bent on the suppression of the people and war provocation  moves, the earlier the day of its disgraceful destruction will  come.</p>

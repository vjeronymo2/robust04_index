			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / World Stock Markets (America): Telecoms bid brightens weak session Wall Street US stocks tracked the downward direction in bonds yesterday morning but failed to follow them back up during the afternoon, writes Frank McGurty in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 16.66 lower at 3,697.75 and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.31 at 451.72. NYSE volume was 267.9m shares. Secondary markets were firmer, the American SE composite gaining 1.40 at 443.79 and the Nasdaq composite adding 0.93 at 740.30. In the morning the co-ordinated intervention by the Federal Reserve and other central banks to support the dollar in the currency markets had no discernible impact on stocks, even though a stronger dollar would make US-denominated equities more attractive investments. The Fed's action may have helped equities, if it had first given a lift to bonds. However, the US Treasury market could not muster much confidence in the Fed's ability to sustain its interventionist strategy, and bond prices fell back. The session also brought a bit of bad news from the Commerce Department, reinforcing the cautious mood prevailing ahead of Friday's employment data. It announced that March factory orders had risen 1.1 per cent, more than double the rate forecast by economists. The figure heightened expectations that Friday's employment data would indicate an acceleration of the economy in April and an early and perhaps aggressive move by the Fed to still higher interest rates. The dollar intervention, ironically, was seen as enhancing the likelihood of an early strike by the Fed, as higher rates could help prop up the value of the US currency. Amid these cross-currents, the Dow industrials fell nearly 30 points by mid-morning, while other market indices held relatively steady. As the afternoon began, the blue chips trimmed their losses. But a rally never materialised even though news of weaker than expected April car sales gave a late lift to the sagging bond market. Telecommunications took over from pharmaceuticals as the straw that stirred stocks. Speculation about takeovers in the drug sector gave way to the possibility of activity in the telephone field after LDDS Communications offered to buy WilTel Communications, an arm of the Williams Companies, for Dollars 2bn. Williams, which said it would explore its options, climbed Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 29. LDDS put on Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 23 3/4 on the Nasdaq. Time Warner, which jumped on Tuesday amid speculation it would become a takeover target, added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 39 1/2 . TCA Cable TV rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 21 3/8 after disclosing plans to buy back up to 1m shares. Canada Toronto weakened in moderate trading as volatile bond markets continued to weigh on equities and investors awaited today's Ontario budget. The TSE 300 composite index ended 14.4 off at 4,269.2 and falls outnumbered rises by 381 to 325. Volume came to 75.0m shares valued at CDollars 579.2m. The golds group bucked the trend, advancing 2.0 per cent as the bullion price in New York rose USDollars 1 to USDollars 376.95 an ounce. The consumer products sector slipped 1.5 per cent as the heavily weighted Seagram sank CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 40 1/4 amid rumours that it is preparing to launch a USDollars 17.9bn takeover bid for Time-Warner. Brazil Equities in Sao Paulo closed 4.5 per cent down in a market starved for news and from which foreigners were mostly absent. The Bovespa index shed 745 points to 15,738.</p>

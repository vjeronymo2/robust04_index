			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade circular </F> dated 19 June 1991 announced by the Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation in Beijing on 5 October 1993:  "Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Announces a  Circular Formulated by the Ministry of Foreign Economic  Relations and Trade on the Strict Examination, Approval, and  Issuance of Import and Export Licenses to Foreign-Invested  Enterprises"]    [Text] Based on the relevant State Council regulations and  in order to further improve and strengthen the management of  applications for import and export licenses filed by  foreign-funded enterprises, the relevant regulations have been  clarified as follows:    1. When examining and approving the establishment of  foreign-funded enterprises and compensatory trade projects,  matters relating to the licenses for importing raw materials and  spare parts and for exporting products, including the increase  or decrease in the number of the originally approved licenses  due to the expansion of operational domains by enterprises and  goods requiring one-time export licenses should be reported in  the form of official documents by the economic and trade bureaus  of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities, and  cities listed separately for development to the Ministry of  Foreign Economic Relations and Trade [MOFERT], which will  examine them and give official replies in the form of ministry  documents.    2. Within the number of licenses permitted by the official  replies from MOFERT, if the products produced by the enterprises  themselves meet the stipulations of the replies, the  license-issuing departments should issue licenses according to  the reply documents. No license should be issued to an  enterprise which does not have the MOFERT document or a letter  permitting a license. Various license-issuing units should  observe strict examination and inspection.    3. It is hereby reiterated that foreign-funded enterprises  are not permitted to purchase products for export without  authorization, and, if such a situation is discovered, it will  be handled as an illegal operation. If an enterprise needs to  purchase products for export in order to strike a balance  between foreign exchange income and expenditures, it should go  through the reporting and approval formalities according to the  relevant regulations of the country.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup" by Hu Hangying: "Russia Adjusting Its Principles </F> for Economic Reform"]    [Text] Moscow, April 5 (XINHUA) -- The main task facing the  Russian president, government, and economic departments is to  adjust their principles for economic reform.    According to some Russian economists and government  officials, the sense of a market economy has been planted in the  minds of their citizens and changes have taken place in Russia's  economic system and ways of management since the country began  to reform the economy in 1992.    Since then, private enterprises, stock companies and  cooperatives have been established in Russia.    However, as these economists and officials point out, very  serious problems still exist.    Russia's economy and industrial and agricultural production  have been declining since the beginning of 1992, casting gloom  over economic reform.    Industrial output dropped by 16.3 percent in 1993 compared  with 1992, and output value for the first two months of 1994  decreased 23.6 percent compared with the same period last year.    Russia's agricultural and husbandry production has also  declined between six and eight percent.    Economic recession has become the most difficult issue for  the government.    Therefore, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin  proposed that they "close the door of romanticism." one of the  important principles for Russian reform is to strengthen the  government's control over the economy.    According to the prime minister, Russia can neither return  to  its old management by administrative decree nor take a  laissez-faire attitude toward enterprises when the economy is in  turmoil.    Another serious problem is high inflation and soaring  commodity prices.    Average monthly inflation was 20 percent, and prices went up  10 fold in 1993. This January prices increased by 22 percent.    In order to solve these problems the Russian government has  decided to adopt a comprehensive administration system.    The government now offers loans to departments of national  defense, energy and agriculture to stimulate production.    The government is also attempting to tackle the problem of  triangle debts, which are estimated by the ministry of finance  to be 31 trillion rubles.    The government has also decided to allow enterprises which  have long incurred losses to go bankrupt in order to ease the  nation's burden.    Other means, such as an increase in export taxes and  rigorously enforced tax regulations, will be implemented to curb  inflation, which Russia has pledged to decrease to seven or nine  percent by the end of 1994.    At the same time, Russia will continue its privatization  policies. Some 70 percent of all stores, hotels and other  service facilities had been privatized by the end of 1993.    The declining standard of living and the extremes of wealth  and poverty are becoming serious problems which must be dealt  with.    One-third of Russia's citizens are living below the poverty  line, and some four million people are unable to provide  themselves with basic necessities.    The income of the rich, perhaps 10 percent of the  population,  is about 30 percent of the total income of society. But the  poor, another 10 percent of the population, secures only 3.4  percent of the nation's income.    Therefore, chernomyrdin proposed enhancing the reform of  social guarantees and gradually increasing retirement pay. The  government will also compensate veterans for savings lost  before 1992.    Russia called for a crack-down on crime in a government  report; organized crime groups were rampant throughout the  country last year.    It is believed that these mafia-type gangs now control over  40,000 economic entities in Russia, including state-run  enterprises and banks. This situation is greatly disturbing  both to society and the government.    The above policies are being carried out by the Russian  government one by one, and time alone will demonstrate their  effectiveness.</p>

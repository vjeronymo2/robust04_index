			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / SPD will not join any coalition led by Kohl Leaders of Germany's opposition Social Democrats warned Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday that if he loses his coalition majority at the general election in October, he cannot expect to remain in the government. They flatly rejected hints by Mr Kohl that a 'grand coalition' between his Christian Democrats and the opposition SPD might be possible. However, even if the electoral outcome forces such a solution, yesterday's statements suggest that the SPD will not accept the chancellor as its leader. 'He cannot seriously think we would allow him to stay in government if his coalition loses its majority,' said Mr Gunther Verheugen, general secretary of the SPD and its chief electoral strategist. His declaration, to an election campaign launch conference of party candidates and officials, marks a clear shift in SPD tactics to focus their assault on Mr Kohl himself. It amounts to a calculated risk, for the chancellor is also seen as the best selling point for the governing coalition. Mr Verheugen also challenged Mr Kohl to face Mr Rudolf Scharping, the party leader, in a public debate on television, if he insists on fighting the campaign on the basis of personalities. Mr Scharping himself gave another fighting speech to his supporters, determined to allay criticism that he is too dull and worthy to win popular support. He accused Mr Kohl of being responsible for the mood of uncertainty and lack of direction in the country. Although the SPD has obviously decided that frontal attack on Mr Kohl is the best form of defence, the party is also hammering away at the government's record on unemployment, social justice, and the unequal pain of German unification. Those were the issues, Mr Verheugen said, about which the German electors cared. He warned the party against paying too much attention to the opinion polls, which show the SPD trailing between three and eight percentage points behind the CDU. The same polls showed that the coalition no longer had any majority itself, he said, thanks to the weakness of the Free Democratic party, the junior partner. At the same time, both SPD and CDU are acutely aware that the entire election outcome could hang on the performance in eastern Germany of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the former Communist party. If the PDS can win its way into the next parliament, it could prevent either side winning a clear majority - and force them into a grand coalition.</p>

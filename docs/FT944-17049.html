			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / German Elections: Greens' leading light goes for broke - The party has set its sights on a role in a ruling coalition Mr Joschka Fischer, once a 1968 revolutionary, then a taxi driver and now environment minister in the German state of Hesse, leans across the table after a long day and an exhausting evening on the hustings: 'If we don't make it this time, then I'm stepping down. I've had enough.' Mr Fischer is the leading star of the left-wing Greens, Germany's main environmental party. His impassioned performances and his pleas to party colleagues to be serious about government have more than anything else coloured the Green election campaign this year. It is the first time the party has looked not just for a place on the opposition benches, but to become part of a future ruling coalition. To show how serious he is, Mr Fischer even came to Oggersheim, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's home town on the river Rhine to address a town hall so full that latecomers were refused entry. His powers of persuasion have helped change the fortunes of his party, which managed to win only 3.8 per cent of the vote in the federal elections four years ago, losing all its seats in parliament. In the latest polls, the party has been scoring between 7 and 8 per cent. It has also since recovered a presence in the federal parliament by teaming up with Bundnis 90, the dissidents who helped topple the former East German regime, but the setback for the western Greens taught them some important lessons. First, Mr Fischer's 'realistic' wing of the party - the Realos - who always wanted power to implement their policies, overcame the 'fundamentalists', or Fundis, who were more concerned with the purity of their ideas. The once motley collection of protesters has given way to a more experienced and older collection of parliamentarians, local politicians and academics. They have almost become part of the establishment. They could well become the third force in German politics, instead of the Free Democratic party (FDP), for decades the junior partner in Bonn coalition governments. The Greens are part of a coalition government in the northern city state of Bremen, shared power with the Social Democratic party (SPD) in Lower Saxony until earlier this year, and are still a vociferous partner in coalition with the SPD in the state of Hesse. But for all their polished new image the Greens still like to shock: earlier this year the party demanded the abolition of the German army, German withdrawal from Nato, and abolition of the Nato alliance. All of those have horrified the SPD, the Greens' natural coalition partner in Bonn, and given welcome election ammunition to the government. But as the election campaign has picked up speed, leading Greens have been at pains to play down their more wayward plans, and insist that most things are up for negotiation. The only sacred cows in the coalition talks are an end to nuclear energy, the introduction of speed limits on Germany's overcrowded motorways and a new tax structure which would reflect the environmental costs of production. 'What we need most of all is a change of direction,' says Mr Ludger Volmer, joint spokesman for the party, referring to the new taxes. 'If it becomes clear that there is no change of direction there won't be a coalition with us.' But despite the new dynamism, helped along by popular candidates, the party senses that it may still stumble at the last fence. 'We are just not quite sure,' as one long-time Green adviser puts it. The Greens know their core electorate stands at just 4 per cent, one per cent short of the threshold needed to get seats in the Bundestag. Opinion polls ahead of previous federal elections have suggested Green support was markedly higher than it turned out to be on the day. Voters seem to trust them as a potential member of government at the state level, but not for Bonn. One setback has been the party's performance in eastern Germany. Despite the environmental scars left by the former regime, the Greens have been unable to mobilise voters there, admitting that for most people worries about the region's ecology come second to more bread-and-butter concerns like getting a job. Instead the Greens have been seeking to woo the better-off, middle-class voters who have traditionally backed the FDP. The small Liberal party is in real danger of losing its parliamentary seats, after years of being in government with either the conservative Christian Democrats or the left-of-centre SPD. As far as the Greens are concerned, however, the shift to the political centre has cost the party the support of some of its more traditional radical voters. Germans who supported the party because of what they call its 'instinctive radicalism' now heckle Green politicians on the hustings and vow they will back the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the follow-on to the former East German communist party. Threats like that do not impress Mr Fischer, who argues that the party has moved on from mere protest voting. 'People who vote PDS may annoy Kohl,' Mr Fischer said. 'We are fighting for a majority to get rid of him altogether.'</p>

			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARINES BEGIN GROUNDING FLEET OF FAILING HARRIER JETS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: FAILURE OF SENSORS MADE BY NORTHROP BLAMED. FIRM PLEADED GUILTY TO  FALSIFYING TESTS ON SYSTEM.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps has begun to ground its AV-8B Harrier jets because of failures  in on-board sensor systems supplied by Northrop Corp., which pleaded guilty in  February to criminal charges of falsifying tests of the equipment,  congressional sources said Monday.  </P> <P> The Marines began the grounding in April and will have grounded five planes by  October, after which the aircraft will be taken out of service at an average of  1 1/2 planes per month, according to congressional sources quoting Navy  documents.  </P> <P> The Harrier jet is a key weapon in the Persian Gulf crisis, with about 60 of  the aircraft estimated to be deployed in the region. Information about whether  the defects in the sensors might be affecting Marine military operations there  is classified, a congressional committee source said.  </P> <P> The Marine Corps has just under 200 Harriers in its fleet.  </P> <P> A Navy official Monday confirmed that aircraft are being grounded. He said the  Northrop sensor systems, which control the stability of the aircraft, are  failing at a faster rate than projected by Navy requirements. No spare sensors  are available to repair the aircraft, necessitating parking the $22-million  Harriers as problems arise, the congressional source said.  </P> <P> No other company produces the "rate sensor assembly" and it is unclear how long  it would take to find another maker for the part. Last year, Northrop was  suspended from receiving new contracts for the sensor, among other products.  </P> <P> Northrop officials said Monday that they had no knowledge of the grounding.  </P> <P> The Navy documents are expected to be introduced today at a hearing before the  House Committee on Government Operations about fraudulent testing of Harrier  parts by Northrop. The hearing will be the seventh held since 1987, called by  three different committees, to examine problems at Northrop.  </P> <P> "We simply don't know whether the weapons will do their job," said Rep.  Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), a committee member. "We may find that some of what  our soldiers depend upon will not perform up to specification. It may threaten  the lives of many of our men and women in uniform."  </P> <P> Reliability problems with the sensors have caused accidents, committee sources  said. Details of the mishaps are unavailable and Northrop officials said they  are unaware of any such accidents. A federal official corroborated the report  that aircraft have had mishaps and added that the Navy has fought efforts to  reveal the full extent of the safety problems associated with the sensor.  </P> <P> Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 counts of falsifying tests on a guidance system  for an Air Force cruise missile and on the so-called "rate sensor assembly" for  the Harrier. The federal indictment charged Northrop with not performing  required tests and providing falsified results.  </P> <P> Under its Navy contract, the company was supposed to vibrate the Harrier sensor  at 32 times the force of gravity, but the company's test device was not capable  of vibrating at that intensity, said William Fahey, the assistant U.S. attorney  who prosecuted the company.  </P> <P> "They vibrated them to less than half the requirement," Fahey said Monday.  </P> <P> After the government's investigation of Northrop became public in 1987,  Northrop obtained permission from the Navy to relax the vibration requirement,  but it was still unable to get the sensor assemblies to pass the test, Fahey  said. The company asked for a second reduction in the requirement, which the  Navy agreed to in 1988, Fahey said.  </P> <P> Even after the second reduction, which took the requirement to 12 times the  force of gravity, Northrop had to "reconfigure" the sensor so that it could  pass the test, Fahey said. Neither the Navy nor Northrop undertook any program  to repair or replace the earlier Harrier jets with the improperly tested and  produced units, he said.  </P> <P> Fahey also said that federal investigators obtained preliminary reports that  aircraft accidents were occurring with the defective sensors, but the Navy  never produced a full record.  </P> <P> "The Justice Department has had difficulty obtaining a complete record of the  performance history of the Harrier jets with respect to the rate sensor  assemblies' ability to perform as contractually required," Fahey said.  </P> <P> A Northrop spokesman said the company has sought unsuccessfully to obtain  government reports about the failure rates of the sensors. In the past,  Northrop has stated that the fraudulent testing was done by a small group of  employees who were fired and that the operation in Pomona, where the false  testing occurred, has been closed.  </P> <P> Although the criminal case is closed, Fahey said the Justice Department is  continuing to pursue a civil case against Northrop on the Harrier. The Pentagon  has yet to conclude an administrative case that will determine the future of  the Northrop subsidiary that produced the sensor.  </P> <P> That subsidiary, the precision products division in Norwood, Mass., is under an  administrative suspension that bars it from obtaining new government contracts.  A Northrop spokesman said the company is still making the rate sensor  assemblies under prior contracts.  </P> <P> Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Government Operations panel  said, "Northrop is a case study in botched Pentagon procurement." The  committee's panel on legislation and national security will conduct the hearing  today.  </P></p>

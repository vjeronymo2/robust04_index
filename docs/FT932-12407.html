			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Government Bonds: Treasuries lose ground ahead of supply onslaught US TREASURY prices tumbled across the board yesterday afternoon as the market braced itself for the week's onslaught of supply following a disappointing two-year note auction in the afternoon. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  29/32 at 102 27/32 , yielding 6.895 per cent. At the short end, the three-year note was  5/32 lower, to yield 4.240 per cent. Prices were weak in the morning and deteriorated further after the afternoon's Dollars 15.25bn two-year note auction, where demand was meagre and the yield was unexpectedly high, at 3.88 per cent. Overall, market sentiment was negative following reports that Mr Leon Panetta, budget director for President Bill Clinton, had become discouraged about prospects for significant deficit reduction this year. Economic data released in the morning put further pressure on bonds, with an unexpected rise in the consumer confidence index for April to 67.7, from 63.2 in March. THE UK government bond market rallied on the eve of today's Pounds 3bn auction of 7 1/4 per cent five-year gilts which is expected to meet reasonable demand. The market was particularly strong at the long end, where stock typically gained more than half a point. The 8 3/4 per cent bond due 2017, for instance, advanced by about  5/8 to 103 1/8 . One reason was that dealers felt the market had been oversold before the auction. The 'when issued' price for the 7 3/4 bond gained about 3/8 , giving a yield of 7.05 per cent. THE GERMAN market was buoyed in the morning by hopes of an acceleration in interest rate cuts following a press report of comments by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president. The bund futures contract opened higher at 95.40 and rose to 95.70. But the message in the article was not unequivocal, and the announcement that there would be a new bund issue next week took the wind out of the market's sails. The futures contract ended unchanged. Today, attention focuses on the repo rate, which is expected to come down from 8.09 per cent to about 7.90 per cent, taking up most of last week's 25 basis point cut in the discount rate to 7.25 per cent. THE ITALIAN market made more progress, mainly in the futures market, on the back of the appointment of central banker Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi as prime minister-designate. Although lacking in political experience, he is seen as good news in terms of support for the lira and a hard line on the budget deficit. Foreign investors have become keener on Italian stock as the currency risk has lessened. A RISE in the Nikkei average index to more than 20,000 and a sharp improvement in some economic indicators hit the Japanese government bond market yesterday. Alongside the rise in an index of leading indicators from 54.5 in January to 80 in February, the Economic Planning Agency fanned recovery hopes by commenting that the bottom of the cycle had been reached. The futures contract fell from 109.43 to 108.90, while the yield on the benchmark 145 issue due 2002 rose to 4.28 per cent from 4.195 per cent. Traders were also adopting cautious positions before the Golden Week holidays. The influence of the currency was evident in London trading. After the yen hit a high of Y109.20 to the dollar, the futures contract recovered to 109.06. However, intervention by the US Federal Reserve - for the first time this year on the dollar-yen front - sent both the yen and the futures contract back the other way.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the office of President Lamine Zeroual </F> on 18 March]    [Text] In his address to the nation, President Lamine  Zeroual put the emphasis on dialogue and described it as the  best method and way to deal with the situation and the basis for  political action in the country, since this dialogue constitutes  one of the main points included in the platform adopted by the  national conference. In this context, as from next week the  president of state will start talks with national figures,  political parties and social and economic organizations. This  dialogue has been defined in the various statements made by the  president of state as being an honest dialogue from which no one  who respects the Constitution will be excluded; and a  constructive dialogue that will bring together all Algerians who  are concerned about the continuity of the state and the  interests of the people.    The purpose of this dialogue is to ensure Algeria's revival  and to return to the rule of the people's choice in an  atmosphere of clarity and continuity.    Moreover, the state is endeavoring with determination to  solve the country's current problems out of its resolve to serve  an effort that requires more deeds than words. Due to the  speedy nature [as heard] of the security situation, the mission  of the security forces, which is to ensure the safety of the  citizens and their property and eradicate the terrorist  violence, needs to continue relentlessly. This mission is  carried out with a spirit of self- denial and sacrifice by those  who are in charge of leading it and executing it on the ground.    The government is also continuously committed to tackling  economic and social problems in the framework of the directives  given by the president of state during the first meeting of the  Council of Ministers on 27 February. It is obvious that this  effort to restore our economy requires a commitment from the  entire nation and its mobilization through the organizations  representing it.    Thus, the national dialogue, which the president of state is  intending to resume, falls within the framework of a number of  integrated and well-ordered actions. This dialogue will  undoubtedly provide appropriate conditions for the emergence of  a national consensus that will bring together all the Algerians  who love their homeland and who adhere to patriotic values, the  ideals of the eternal 1 November Revolution and the principles  of our Constitution. This consensus will enable Algeria to  confront the various pressing challenges facing it. It will  also enable it to achieve the goals of the transitional period;  these goals were and will remain: Civil peace, democracy, and  prosperity.</p>

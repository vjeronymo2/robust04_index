			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Italy's politicians try to pick up the pieces ITALIAN political leaders yesterday began the complex task of trying to forge agreement on a new broad-based government in the wake of Monday's overwhelming referendum vote for quick reform. The eight referendums, all of which were approved, will have to be converted into law within 60 days. This involves a large amount of legislation and considerable consensus in a parliament where party loyalties are badly frayed. The sheer size of the referendum victory has caught politicians by surprise and complicated the replacement of the four-party coalition headed by Mr Giuliano Amato, who on Monday informed President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro that his government, formed last June, had ended its useful life. The Socialist prime minister is expected to spell out his strategy and the timetable for his resignation when he addresses parliament tomorrow. Most political commentators agreed yesterday that parliament had to decide on two broad options for the next transitional government. The 82 per cent vote to change the electoral system for the Senate - and by extension to the Chamber of Deputies - pointed strongly towards a government headed by a new face or at least a figure above party politics. Mr Mario Segni, leader of the referendum movement, is the most obvious new face. However, he will not be easily backed by the Christian Democrats whom he deserted two weeks ago. His supporters said yesterday he risked losing political capital by heading a government of limited duration and while he had yet to form a party of his own. Mr Scalfaro is reportedly averse to choosing a prime minister who is outside parliament or 'institutional' like the leader of the chamber of deputies. The latter is the favoured solution of the main opposition party, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). In this deadlock, despite the demand for a new face, Prof Amato may well prove the most effective person around whom to build an enlarged coalition. The parties are anxious to achieve a quick solution. The government has several vital issues pending, including wage/productivity talks with the unions and a mini-budget to curb the public sector deficit. Parliament itself must address the task of deciding whether to waive parliamentary immunity on Mr Giulio Andreotti, the veteran politician and seven times premier, accused of alleged links with the Mafia. Yesterday magistrates sent further evidence to parliament, including photographs allegedly showing Mr Andreotti with Mafia figures. Editorial comment, Page 25</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Premeditated Act of Military Threat" -- KCNA headline] </F>   [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets decided to stage a large-scale  "Ulchi Focus Lens" joint military exercise across South Korea in  coming August. A MINJU CHOSON analyst today brands this as part  of their deliberate moves to push the situation of the Korean  peninsula to a more grave phase.    The news analyst says:    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets said the  "Ulchi Focus Lens" exercise is intended to fill up the "blank"  up to the "Team Spirit" joint military exercise which was put  off till November. But it is a baloney meant to justify their  military actions.    The last few months alone witnessed "Hwarang" war exercise  in  which some 1.3 million troops were mobilized, a "joint tactical  training for the first half of this year" involving the puppet  ground, naval and air forces, and a "large-scale combined  landing exercise". Now, "Rimpac" war exercises are being staged  in the Pacific by the United States, Japan, South Korean puppets  and others.    These facts show that the decision to stage the "Ulchi Focus  Lens" joint military exercise is based on a war strategy  designed to drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to a  phase of war, not a "countermeasure".    If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets  defiantly ignite a war on the Korean peninsula, they will have  to pay dearly for it.</p>

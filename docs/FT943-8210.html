			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bank of Ireland in Dollars 53m US east coast acquisition Bank of Ireland yesterday announced the acquisition of Great Bay Bankshares of New Hampshire for Dollars 52.6m (Pounds 33.9m), underlining renewed confidence in the US east coast banking sector. The purchase price represents 1.3 times GBB's book value. GBB has five branches offering full banking services in south-eastern New Hampshire and southern Maine, and will be integrated into the existing 73-branch network of Bank of Ireland's main US subsidiary, First NH bank. GBB has total assets of Dollars 319m, including a Dollars 180m loan portfolio consisting mostly of residential mortgages as well as commercial mortgages and consumer lending. It reported pre-tax profits of Dollars 2.6m in its last financial year, and is forecast to produce Dollars 5m this time. Bank of Ireland said the acquisition had a 'very low level' of non-performing loans and represented a 'geographic filling-in' of First NH's coverage of New Hampshire 'in an area where we did not have the market share we wanted, and an affluent area at that'. The group's total market share across the state now stands at 20 per cent. Bank of Ireland First Holdings, the holding company for the group's US subsidiaries, reported a Dollars 10.3m pre-tax profit for the quarter ending June 30, compared with a Dollars 2.7m loss. Bank of Ireland first went into the Hew Hampshire market in 1988 and suffered heavy losses, but BOIFH produced its first profit last year, with Dollars 8m pre-tax.</p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Management: Testimony to the German system - John Craven gives his view of the role played by the banks during the recent crisis at Metallgesellschaft Many newspaper articles about the recent problems at Metallgesellschaft, the Frankfurt-based metal, mining and industrial group, have criticised the role played by the German banks, and particularly by Deutsche Bank. As the only foreigner on the board of managing directors of Deutsche Bank, I may be in a unique position to put these criticisms in perspective. I have not been involved personally in the resolution of the situation but have witnessed at first hand what has been achieved. Much of the criticism has focused on a perceived conflict of interest between certain German banks as shareholders of Metallgesellschaft, and their position as principal creditors, and on the role played by Ronaldo Schmitz, who is both a colleague of mine on the board of managing directors of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the supervisory board of Metallgesellschaft. The suggestions have been that there is too close a relationship between the leading German banks, companies in which they may have shareholdings, and their supervisory boards; and that the banks have been motivated by their interests as shareholders to force the creditor banks to accept a resolution of the problem which favoured the interests of the banks as shareholders over those of the creditor banks which had no shareholdings. In my opinion, the prompt and efficient way in which the German institutions acted to resolve a crisis that might, in other circumstances, have resulted in a massive bankruptcy, is a testimony to the German system. This is not to be critical of the way such matters are handled in other financial centres and jurisdictions. Within a few weeks of the scale of the problems facing Metallgesell-schaft eventually becoming known to the supervisory board, the German banks provided the company with emergency liquidity in excess of DM1.5bn (Pounds 580m) to enable it to meet its pressing obligations; the management of the company was almost completely replaced (six out of eight members of the board of managing directors are new appointees - some from external sources, some internal); the creditor banks agreed to a massive equity-for-debt exchange; and, subject to the approval of two general meetings of shareholders to be held on February 24 and March 30 1994, the shareholders will have agreed to a DM2.7bn recapitalisation. The future of a leading international company employing 58,000 people across several countries will have been put on a sound footing under new management that can concentrate on the reorganisation of the business without the pressures of an unsound financial structure. I would submit that this is an extraordinary feat which would have been difficult, if not impossible, to achieve in the timescale involved under other systems, and one which is deserving of praise rather than criticism. It is also noteworthy that the problems were resolved entirely in the private sector and without the intervention of the banking supervision or other authorities in Germany, or elsewhere. Admittedly, the speed with which a solution was implemented was dictated by the German bankruptcy law: this lays down a very tight timetable effectively forcing the supervisory board to declare bankruptcy within 21 days of it becoming clear that a deficiency of net assets exists, unless this deficiency is remedied within this time limit. In reality I think the fact that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank were both shareholders and creditors of Metallgesellschaft - and the fact that some 65 per cent of the equity was held by just five institutions (including the two banks) who collaborated in the resolution - worked to the advantage of all the shareholders in the company. There was a community of economic interest between shareholders and creditors in preserving Metallgesell-schaft as a going concern. The result might have been quite different if shareholders and creditors had been competing to protect their own interests. I was interested to read a recent speech by Pen Kent, an executive director of the Bank of England, to the Association of Corporate Treasurers, which said that 'a weakness of refinancing a company involving just its banks is that they are generally protecting their own positions at the expense of other creditors and shareholders'. He continued: 'It would be more satisfactory if the opportunity to participate in a workout were available to all creditors and shareholders - however, this would seem to be an unobtainable objective . . . ' There is, I think, a perception that the banks in Germany have a disproportionate influence over the affairs of German companies and exercise this through the many memberships of corporate supervisory boards that are occupied by members of the boards of managing directors of the major banks. This is a wrong perception. Where bank directors have seats on the supervisory boards of industrial companies they are not there to protect the interests of the bank. German corporate law states that the responsibility of the members of the board of managing directors (the Vorstand) and that of the supervisory board (the Aufsichtsrat) is to look after the interests of all the stakeholders in the business. This extends not only to the shareholders and the creditor banks, but also to the interests of the company as a going concern and to the interests of the suppliers, the customers, the workforce, the management and the communities in which the company operates. In the Metallgesellschaft case all these stakeholders have been protected by the steps that have been taken. Surprising though it may seem to outsiders, members of supervisory boards who happen to be working directors of the banks do not divulge to their bank colleagues confidential information about the companies on whose supervisory boards they sit. They take very seriously their obligations to act in the interests of all the stakeholders in the company. The influence of the German banks - and in particular Deutsche Bank - is also, in my view, blown out of all proportion by the international press. It is true that Deutsche Bank has a number of significant industrial participations - the details are a matter of public knowledge. In Germany the number of quoted public companies is, in relation to the size of the economy, far smaller than, for example, in the UK. In Germany there is not the requirement for companies to establish segregated pension funds - a large investment force in the UK - and insurance companies are restricted in the extent to which they can hold equity investments. The result is that a very large share of holdings in German industrial companies is held by other industrial companies, in particular companies which have origins in the utility industries. The banks are much smaller shareholders, as a group, than is the foreign perception. Their influence as shareholders is commensurately less than is perceived outside Germany. As for the suggestion that the members of the supervisory board of Metallgesellschaft failed to exercise their supervisory responsibilities effectively, I would only comment that the efficiency of a supervisory board is not dissimilar to that of the non-executive directors of a public company in the UK. The effectiveness of the non-executive is a direct function of the quality and flow of information from executive management. I pass no judgment on the discharge by management of its responsibilities in the Metallgesellschaft case since I am not aware of all the facts. If information is withheld in response to direct questions, no Cadbury or other systems of corporate governance will enhance the ability of the non-executive or supervisory board member to fulfil his responsibilities adequately. However, I would not be surprised to see a trend in Germany towards the establishment of audit committees made up of supervisory board members to provide a forum for the transmission of information direct from external auditors to the supervisory board.

			<p><P> August 12, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NO BONES ABOUT IT  </P> <P> Your editorial was absolutely right. NIMBY is the name of the tune concerning  the proposed soup kitchen in North County. ("No Purpose Would Be Served In  Rejecting Soup Kitchen Site," Aug. 5).  </P> <P> When I buy a home next to an airport and observe airplanes taking off, it's  reasonable to expect a certain amount of noise, odor and, on occasion, a crash.  I was aware of the problem when I bought -- that's why the home was so cheap.  </P> <P> When I buy a home next to friendly neighbors, nice atmosphere, no smog, no  traffic, no crime and winding country roads, I buy because that's the way it  is, and that's the way I would like it to stay. There was no soup kitchen, and  I don't want a soup kitchen, make no bones about it.  </P> <P> STEVE LONG  </P> <P> Vista  </P></p>

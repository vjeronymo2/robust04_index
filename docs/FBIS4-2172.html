			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 (XINHUA) -- The Agricultural Bank of  China (ABC) opened a representative office in Tokyo today in an  effort to exploit business activities in Japan.    Inaugurating the office, ABC President Ma Yongwei said it  will concentrate on collecting international financial  information and raising commercial funds in Japan.    The move is a step toward the ABC's internationalization and  will serve to promote its exchange and cooperation with Japanese  commercial banks, Ma said.    The ABC has already set up representative offices in Hong  Kong, London, New York and Singapore.    The move followed recent opening of offices in Tokyo by the  People's Bank of China, the Construction Bank and the  Communication Bank. The Bank of China also has a Tokyo branch.</p>

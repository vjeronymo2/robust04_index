			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Multimedia seeks to raise up to Pounds 3.5m MULTIMEDIA Investments, a small Sheffied-based company set up to finance the production of interactive compact discs for the consumer market by independent producers, is seeking to raise up to Pounds 3.5m from investors through a share and loan stock issue. Mr Michael Mallett, chairman, said 'the market for multimedia products is an exploding one with very considerable potential. It exists and it is growing fast.' Initially the company plans to fund the production discs based on the Philips CD-i format which enables home users to play interactive games or retrieve information from a CD-i player plugged into a television set. The first disc funded by Multimedia Investments is already in production and is a CD-i version of Cluedo, the popular board game which is being produced under licence from Waddington Games. Options have also been taken on the Granada television series, 'Disappearing World' and on the book 'An Illustrated History of the World.' While warning that it is not possible to produce accurate predictions in a market growing at over 40 per cent a year, the company has provided illustrative financial projections showing pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.2m in 1997. Investors are being invited to subscribe for units, each consisting of 20 ordinary shares, 80 preference shares and Pounds 900 unsecured loan stock priced at Pounds 1,000 per unit and the offer is conditional upon the minimum subscription of 660 units. The prospectus is available from Multimedia Investments 0742-722272.</p>

			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOPE DWINDLES IN FINDING GIRLS' PARENTS  </P> <P> Police and child welfare officials have given up almost all hope of finding the  parents of two baby girls abandoned in Oxnard two months ago.  </P> <P> A passing stranger found the two toddlers wet and crying Dec. 14 in the women's  restroom at Colonia Park in Oxnard.  </P> <P> Oxnard Police Detective Mike Palmieri said that by all appearances the parents  or guardians do not want to be found.  </P> <P> "It's just one of those baffling cases," Palmieri said. "We just don't know  where to go from here."  </P> <P> A witness told police that she saw two men and a woman visit the park carrying  the two girls. She said they left in a black pickup truck without the.  </P> <P> Later, a man passing the park restroom told police that he heard the sound of  crying inside the building and asked a woman to check. The woman found the  girls lying in a pool of water and urine bundled in a blanket.  </P> <P> Police have ruled out kidnaping, Palmieri said. No one has reported missing  children matching their descriptions. The girls may have been left at the  restroom by parents who wanted them to be discovered by workers at a nearby  day-care center, he said.  </P> <P> Ventura County Children's Services, an agency that handles abused and abandoned  children, has had no luck in tracking down the children's parents.  </P> <P> Frank Ferratta, a program manager at the agency that oversees about 900  children who are dependents of the court, said only one or two babies are  abandoned each year in Ventura County, usually by parents who cannot afford to  care for them.  </P> <P> "In the 17 years of doing this work, I have not encountered such complete  mystery," Ferratta said. "We don't have very many of these situations."  </P> <P> If no one comes forward to claim the two girls, a Ventura County Superior Court  judge in June will decide their fate, Ferratta said, adding that the agency  will recommend that parental rights be legally terminated so that the girls can  be adopted.  </P> <P> "At this time we're in a holding pattern. We have to, by law, do all our effort  in locating the parents," Ferratta said. Ferratta said the search will be  extended in the next few weeks into Los Angeles and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> Authorities have not determined whether the two girls are related.  </P> <P> The two girls have been placed temporarily with foster parents and have become  accustomed to the elderly Ventura couple, Ferratta said. In turn, the foster  parents have nicknamed the two Susie and Connie.  </P> <P> Susie, the eldest, may be as old as 18 months, and Connie is between 6 and 9  months old, said Laura Ayala-Clark, a county social worker assigned to monitor  the two girls. Neither shows signs of physical or emotional abuse.  </P> <P> "The first time I saw Susie she looked like she was a baby that had been well  cared for," Ayala-Clark said. "She came right up to me, she was in my lap."  </P> <P> The girls' parents are believed to be Latino because of Susie's responsiveness  to Spanish words, but she has begun to learn English, Ayala-Clark said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> STOCK SPECIALIST FIRM FINED FOR SECURITIES FRAUD  </P> <P> A specialist firm on the New York Stock Exchange was fined $480,350 for  securities fraud by a judge who said he imposed the sentence as a deterrent.  </P> <P> "The trading while in possession of confidential material is a crime." U.S.  District Judge Charles S. Haight said Thursday at the sentencing of Marcus  Schloss &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "It constitutes an affront to the fair operation of the marketplace."  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Marcus Schloss was the first NYSE firm to be convicted of  felony charges related to insider trading.  </P> <P> The company was convicted last July of conspiracy to trade on inside  information and of securities fraud in connection with its March 1986 purchase  of stock in American Brands Inc.  </P> <P> Marcus Schloss could have been fined a maximum of $1 million -- $500,000 for  each of two counts.  </P> <P> Haight, however, said he considered only a fine of $500,000 because both  charges stemmed from the American Brands deal.  </P> <P> From that amount, the judge said he subtracted $19,650 which the company  previously paid the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle civil charges  stemming from the American Brands trade.  </P></p>

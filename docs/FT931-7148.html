			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: JC Penney has strong final quarter JC PENNEY, one of the largest department store and catalogue retailers in the US, registered a sharp improvement in final-quarter results for 1992-93, with the after-tax profits reaching Dollars 375m. The figure, for the three months to end-January, was scored on sales of Dollars 6.08bn, up from Dollars 5.37bn in the previous year. In the final quarter of 1991-92, the Texas-based retailer recorded after-tax profits of Dollars 37m, but this lowly figure came after net restructuring charges of Dollars 264m. The results take Penney's full-year profits to Dollars 777m after tax, and sales to Dollars 18bn. In the previous year, there was a net profit of Dollars 80m after restructuring and accounting-related charges of Dollars 448m. J. C. Penney's shares rose strongly on the quarter's figures, adding Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 78 1/4 . The company said the improvements last year had been spread across all of its main merchandise divisions - including womens and menswear, childrenswear, home furnishings, and catalogue. It also said early spring merchandise sales in the current year boded well.</p>

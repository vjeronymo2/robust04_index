			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / International Company News: Hewlett in Dollars 100m equity linked deal HEWLETT-Packard, the US computer and electronic instruments manufacturer, has issued Dollars 100m of equity-linked notes (ELN), becoming the first US company to raise financing via ELNs, a product that made its name last year in the Euro-franc market, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. Societe Generale, the French bank, lead-managed the issue, which has a maturity date of April 25 1995. The notes are linked to Hewlett equity to a gearing of 1.34, with 90 per cent of the investor principal guaranteed on maturity if the stock price drops more than 10 per cent. Bankers behind the deal said Hewlett favoured the ELN issue because it would not be dilutive of the company's stock. They also said interest in the paper from both European and US institutions had been good, primarily because of the scarcity of Hewlett debt - there are no convertibles or equity warrants, and only a few straight bonds currently in the market.</p>

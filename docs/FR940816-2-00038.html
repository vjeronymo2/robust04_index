Sea Robin requests authorization to abandon the transportation service it renders under its X&hyph;32 rate schedule on behalf of Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas Gas) effective as of July 29, 1994, all as more fully set forth in the request that is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Sea Robin states that it has provided firm transportation service on behalf of Texas Gas from production areas in offshore Louisiana to delivery points onshore at Erath, Louisiana pursuant to the terms of a Gas Transportation Agreement (Agreement). Texas Gas has requested abandonment of the service under Sea Robin's Rate Schedule X&hyph;32. Accordingly, Sea Robin requests the abandonment of Rate Schedule X&hyph;32, effective July 29, 1994. Sea Robin states that the proposed effective date is appropriate since it is the intent of the parties and, from that date forward, Texas Gas should not be obligated to pay Sea Robin demand charges under the Agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before August 24, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.20). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, and if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate is required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for Applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Lois D.

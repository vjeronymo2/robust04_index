General Morgan was welcomed back to the port town Sunday by  around 1,000 supporters following a decision by UN forces  operating in Somalia to lift an order banning him from the area.    Morgan accompanied his return to one of Somalia's most  sensitive towns with an appeal for his supporters to "work  together for peace," UN forces spokesman Chris Budge said.    Many observers see the southern port as a likely flash point  if the civil war between forces loyal to self-proclaimed interim  president Ali Mahdi Mohamed and rival warlord Mohamed Farah  Aidid re-erupts. The run down of UN forces and withdrawal of  United States forces is seen as raising the chances of new  clashes. The slimming down of the UN contingent is set to  gather pace in February with the current force of 23,318 falling  to around 16,000 by the end of March, Budge said. At its  height, the UN force stood at 30,000.    US, French, German, Greek, Italian, Norwegian and Turkish  contingents are scheduled to leave Somalia by April with their  replacements due in the next few weeks.    UN Secretary-General Butrus Butrus-Ghali complained at the  end of January that governments had ignored his request for  extra troops for Somalia.    With a force of 16,000 the UN would have to forego moves to  disarm Somalia's fighting factions and limit itself to  protecting ports, airports and relief supplies, Butrus-Ghali  said.    Meanwhile, the United Nations special representative in  Somalia, U.S. Admiral Jonathan Howe, met Monday with General  Mohamed Abshir Musa in Bossasso in northeast Somalia. Musa,  whose party dominates the region, is tipped as a possible  intermediary between Aidid and Ali Mahdi because of his contacts  with both camps. Musa could be asked to kick-start stalled  peace negotiations in Nairobi, sources close to UN forces said.    Morgan's banishment followed a bloody struggle for Kismaayo  with his warlord rival Colonel Omar Jays. Jays, closely allied  to Aidid within the Somali National Alliance, has also been  freed to return to Kismaayo but his whereabouts are unknown.  "Apparently he is still in Somalia," Budge said.</p>

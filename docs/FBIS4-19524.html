			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ban." report: "Bundeswehr Not in the Balkans"] </F>   [Text] Bonn, 18 Apr -- On Monday [18 April], Social  Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Scharping basically  rejected the employment of Bundeswehr soldiers in the former  Yugoslavia. With a view to the past and the actions of German  troops in the Balkans, Scharping said that, in whatever role,  German soldiers might become targets there. Thus, he also  rejected the participation of German troops in blue helmet  missions in the successor states of Yugoslavia. Scharping  called on Chancellor Kohl to make the attitude of the Federal  Government clear. While, in former times, Kohl had clearly  rejected the employment of German soldiers in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, the chancellor recently made "soft"  comments. On the other hand, Schaeuble, chairman of the  Christian Democratic Union [CDU]/Christian Social Union [CSU]  Bundestag Group, is advancing considerations that Germany should  actively commit itself in the military sphere in the Balkans.  Scharping called this irresponsible.    The SPD chairman concentrated his criticism on Schaeuble.  Referring to Franco's dictatorship in Spain, he said that his  considerations to also employ the Bundeswehr for internal  security is a "game with Francist ideas." In this way,  Schaeuble is showing that he only takes the Basic Law seriously  if he thinks that this is tactically required. However, with  his considerations, Schaeuble gives the following signal to  foreign countries: "We are an unstable country." He also  expects Kohl to "clarify" this "completely." Scharping accused  Schaeuble of having propagated the impression in Washington,  during his trip to the United States at the end of March, that a  SPD victory in the Bundestag elections will harm German-U.S.  relations.    Scharping said that his visit to Washington and New York  confirmed to him that the "basic orientation" of German foreign  politics should also be maintained in the event of his victory  in the election. Scharping mentioned European integration, the  friendship with France and the United States, integration within  the NATO alliance, a reliable relationship with the East  European states, and cooperation with the developing countries  as elements of foreign policy agreement with the FRG Government.  In detail, there are differences with regard to government  policy. The prospect of entry into the European Union has to be  made clearer to Germany's neighboring states in the East.  Improvements are possible in German-U.S. relations, he said.    With a view to the Federal Constitutional Court proceedings  on the Bundeswehr's participation in missions outside the NATO  mandate, which will start in Karlsruhe this Tuesday, Scharping  said he expects that the complaint of the SPD and the Free  Democratic Party of Germany [FDP] will be successful, so that  the Bundestag will have to be involved in relevant decisions in  the future. As soon as the questions of constitutional policy  are clarified, the political questions will again be in the  foreground. The SPD attitude that it will not even participate  in "warlike" UN measures will be maintained. However, in the  SPD's opinion, Germany can participate in such UN missions as  have been the practice in the past. UN Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali's wish that a UN blue helmet troop be established  with German participation can be reconciled with the resolutions  of the SPD Congress.</p>

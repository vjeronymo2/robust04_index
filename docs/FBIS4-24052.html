			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Proposal for Truth Commission Backed -- The Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 21 June in a page-14 editorial responds to  the police commissioner's report to Security Minister Mufamadi  that if a "truth commission" is established it could "seriously  embarrass the Government and hurt leading members of the ANC,  including Cabinet ministers." "Since when is embarrassment  cause to shrink from justice? Since when are people above  justice simply because they hold high positions?" "What cannot  be tolerated is that these criminals simply confess in secret  and are then granted indemnity." Grasping the full significance  of the effects of a "truth commission", the THE STAR states that  "embarrassing is hardly the word for the effect of a truth  commission: it could wreck the reputation and careers of many;  it will be painful for all; and it will be a searing experience  for families of the victims. But if this is the only way the  truth will emerge, then so be it."    Winnie Mandela-Falati Controversy -- "Courts are there not  only to uphold the law, but also to create precedents that will  best serve the interests of society," begins THE STAR on 22 June  in a page-18 editorial that comments on the recent overturning  of a gag order on Xoliswa Falati who has sought to criticize  Winnie Mandela's past behavior. "In this respect the judge in  the Falati-Mandela case has done South Africa a service." "This  is undoubtedly a landmark decision. In a society subjected to  autocratic abuse for decades, the ground rules need to be  clearly redefined." "The judge has given credence to a view  long held by the press: there are cases where private interests  must yield to public interest."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Finance Minister's Budget Speech Anticipated -- "The wisdom  of retaining Derek Keys in the finance portfolio will be  subjected to an acid test today when he presents the 1994/95  Budget to the National Assembly in Cape Town," begins the  Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 22 June in a page-10  editorial. "There is obviously no better qualified person than  Keys to present a `transition' Budget under the most  extraordinary circumstances. Contradictions and dilemmas  abound. While he is a `hangover' from the old order and is  beholden to the eclipsed minority National Party, he now answers  to a representative government of national unity." "Keys'  difficult challenge is to put forward a practical fiscal plan  able to address the interests and concerns of diverse  constituencies." The importance of economic growth is conceded  but the editorial laments certain attitudes that throw this  concern into the debate on the Reconstruction and Development  Plan. "It's the haves telling the have-nots changes in their  lives are only possible if the wealth of the wealthy remains  untouched. The ANC in particular has been guilty of appeasement  and underplaying the price that all South Africans will have to  pay to fix the damage caused by apartheid. Keys' message today  needs to be blunt and unambiguous -- there will be a lot of pain  before there's gain and the sooner we get on with it, the  better."</p>

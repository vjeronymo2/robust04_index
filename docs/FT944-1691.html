			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Company News (This Week): Analysts divided on whether coal is a rich seam - RJB Mining Private investors have until 3pm tomorrow to decide whether to subscribe for shares in RJB Mining which are being issued to help the company finance its purchase of the English regions of British Coal. RJB is financing its Pounds 815m bid and the working capital needed for the mines by borrowing Pounds 494m from banks and issuing 125m shares to raise Pounds 400m. All of the shares have been placed with institutions, but up to 15 per cent are placed only conditionally to allow 'retail' investors, the general public, to buy them. The shares are being offered at 320p. Trade in RJB's existing shares was suspended in mid-October to allow the company to negotiate a deal with the government and raise the necessary money. The company expects to make pre-tax profits of Pounds 120m next year from the businesses being acquired, putting the shares on a prospective price/earnings ratio of 6.5. The yield on this year's forecast dividend is 4.9 per cent. But if RJB has got its sums right then the real excitement will come later in the decade. By 1999 it expects to making pre-tax profits of Pounds 220m. Between now and then there could be very substantial increases in dividend payments. However mining is considered a risky business by the stock market and some of RJB's competitors question whether the company has got its sums right. They believe it has over-estimated both the size of the market and the prices it can fetch for its coal. Stockbrokers' analysts are divided, with some pointing to the rapid reduction in costs which they expect RJB to be able to achieve and others to what they consider to be over-optimism. The results of the retail offer will be announced on Wednesday and shares will resume trading on December 30, the day RJB is scheduled to take over the pits.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SAN JOAQUIN TOLLWAY ADDS NEW CAR-POOL PLAN, TRAINS  </P> <P> A proposed new design for the 14-mile tollway linking Newport Beach and San  Juan Capistrano calls for commuter trains in the median strip, as well as  Orange County's first reversible car-pool lanes, which would route cars in  either direction, depending on traffic.  </P> <P> The preliminary design plan for the San Joaquin Hills tollway, which still  would include three regular traffic lanes in each direction, will come before  the agency overseeing the $556-million project on Thursday. If approved, the  ambitious proposal will become one of several designs being studied as part of  the tollway's environmental impact report.  </P> <P>  Whether such rail service ultimately would be offered along the route would  depend on the future availability of money for additional trains in Orange  County.  </P> <P> "This will allow commuters a great deal of flexibility and addresses many of  our concerns about meeting regional clean-air goals," said Newport Beach  Councilman John C. Cox Jr., chairman of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation  Corridor Agency, a joint-powers authority that is overseeing the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Reversible Feature Is Beautiful'  </P> <P> "Not only will some people be able to use light rail, but if they are in van  pools, buses or car pools, we can have them use the reversible lanes for the  entire length of the corridor without making them stop at a toll booth," Cox  said. "The reversible feature is beautiful because it would allow us to  (better) handle peak traffic loads."  </P> <P> Ride-share vehicles would be electronically tagged so that automatic-scanning  equipment could identify them and send a tollway users' bill to the appropriate  vehicle operator by mail, Cox said.  </P> <P> The new design proposal will be recommended by the tollway design staff to the  Corridor Agency board of directors at its monthly meeting on Thursday, Cox  said.  </P> <P> The much-delayed environmental report, which has been rewritten and revised, is  scheduled for public circulation again in March, 1990. Construction, Cox said,  would not be delayed by this new design proposal or by plans to combine the  state-mandated environmental impact report with a federal environmental study,  a process that some corridor officials previously wanted to avoid in order to  speed the project to completion.  </P> <P> Construction of the tollway, which will connect the Corona del Mar Freeway at  MacArthur Boulevard in Newport Beach to Interstate 5 in San Juan Capistrano, is  now scheduled to begin in January, 1991, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> New Corridor Design  </P> <P> A new design proposed for the San Joaquin Hills tollway envisions commuter  trains in the median strip and 2 reversible car-pool lanes. The toll road still  would have 3 regular mixed-flow lanes in each direction.  </P></p>

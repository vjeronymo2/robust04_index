			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Lima, 28 Apr (EFE) -- Evangelical pastor Juan  Mallea has been released after spending nine months in prison  and after it was demonstrated that he is innocent of terrorist  charges. He reported today that he was tortured by Peruvian  Counterterrorism police who wanted him to plead guilty.    Mallea announced that his attorney-at-law is studying the  possibility of filing a claim for damages against the Peruvian  police and state for moral and economic damage as a result of  the charges that determined his confinement in the Canto Grande  prison in Lima.    Mallea asked the government to publicly admit its mistake  "because it is for men to admit their mistakes."    Mallea, who was detained on 10 July 1993, held a news  conference. He recalled that on 21 July 1993 he was tortured by  Counterterrorism Directorate (DINCOTE) agents. [passage omitted]</p>

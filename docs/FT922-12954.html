			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / World Trade News: EC set to take Seoul to Gatt over whisky tax EC negotiators have failed to win sufficient concessions in two days of talks on the 150 per cent liquor tax South Korea imposes on whisky, they said yesterday, Reuter reports from Seoul. The EC is now expected to try to take South Korea before Gatt on charges of unfair trade practices, they added. Mr Gilles Anouil, head of the EC Commission's Seoul delegation, said the chances of a Gatt action were 'high'. A decision was likely in May. Seoul offered to cut the whisky tax to 120 per cent during the talks, EC officials said. EC whisky producers say the taxes are imposed to protect Korea's liquor industry, especially the local spirit soju, taxed at 35-50 per cent. 'We have consistently said we would take this case to Gatt,' Mr David Wright, UK ambassador, said. 'We had hoped Seoul's request for these talks meant they would have constructive proposals. This does not seem to be so. We will look at the precise terms, but it looks as if we will have to carry on to Gatt.' If member states push for a Gatt case, the EC could ask to proceed to the Gatt Council at its next meeting in mid-May, Mr Anouil said. 'I think there is a high chance the (311) committee (advising the EC) will favour going to Gatt.' European diplomats said the paperwork for a Gatt case was virtually completed before South Korea won an 11th hour reprieve in February by offering talks. Spirits other than whisky carry what industry officials call discriminatory taxes, with whisky attracting the highest duties. Other imported spirits carry an 80 per cent tax while locally-distilled gin, vodka and rum are taxed at 40 per cent. Liquors carrying a tax over 80 per cent (all imported spirits qualify), also attract a 30 per cent tax. EC officials want to see the ad valorem method of levying tax, based on import value, replaced by a straight tax on alcohol content. Under the ad valorem method, the costlier the product, the higher the tax.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] The recent congress of the Social  Democratic Center Party/Popular Party (CDS/PP) has aroused press  interest in a party seen by noted political commentator and  Social Democratic Party (PSD) luminary Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa  as possessing specific characteristics. Writing in the 21  February Lisbon daily DIARIO DE NOTICIAS, he notes that while  the CDS has always had good members, it has lacked electoral  exposure and weight and never succeeded in attracting voters.  The CDS, which has also been unable to create a party machine,  has suffered from ideological "confusion," Rebelo de Sousa  continues. In fact, never "populist," the party includes a  "measure of Christian democracy, some conservatism, a degree of  liberalism and social-Catholicism, as well as centrist  tendencies." Rebelo de Sousa concedes, however, that the CDS/PP  fields good candidates in municipal elections, many of whom have  won the race. Finally, under the leadership of present chairman  Manuel Monteiro, the party has modified its original Europeanist  principles, which now have taken an antifederalist tinge.    Reviewing the results of the party congress, Rebelo de Sousa  notes that it brought about the CDS's reconciliation with former  leader Diogo Freitas do Amaral, who resigned from the party some  years ago. Secondly, the congress stressed the importance of the  next European Parliament elections, in which Monteiro will lead  the CDS list, despite the fact that his domestic policy lacks  "weight, density, and credibility." Rebelo de Sousa also notes  that one of the CDS's problems is the attempt to deprive the PSD  of an absolute majority. Were Monteiro to fail, the CDS would  lose its bet. Were he to succeed, the PSD could seek an alliance  with the CDS, but Prime Minister Cavaco Silva would never lead  such an alliance. It would thus be "bad business" for the CDS to  ally itself with a party in crisis without Cavaco Silva at its  head, Rebelo de Sousa contends. Finally, were Monteiro to  succeed, the CDS would again lose because the alternative would  be a leftist government, he concludes.</p>

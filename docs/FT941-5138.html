			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / UK Company News: D&amp;G increases 30% to Pounds 4.45m Domestic &amp; General, the domestic appliance insurer, yesterday reported pre-tax profits up 29.6 per cent to Pounds 4.45m for the six months ended December 31. The interim dividend goes up by 23.3 per cent to 9.25p. Despite depressed conditions, sales of extended warranties and annual policies increased by 24.2 per cent to Pounds 32.58m (Pounds 26.23m). Other income fell by 9.8 per cent to Pounds 239,000 (Pounds 265,000) but after claims and commissions D&amp;G's trading activities yielded a surplus of Pounds 8.09m (Pounds 6.29m). Expenses increased to Pounds 6.53m (Pounds 5.55m) and net investment income rose to Pounds 3.12m (Pounds 2.86m). Mr Colin Honey, managing director, said that it was 'too early to comment' about the Office of Fair Trading's investigations into extended warranties on electrical goods. The company is expected by analysts to emerge unscathed from the affair. This is largely because the majority of its income is from direct mail or through manufacturers' schemes, rather than through sales of extended warranties through shops. Analysts suggest that D&amp;G's policies are, on average, between 30 per cent and 50 per cent cheaper than its competitors. Earnings rose to 43.51p (33.55p) per share. COMMENT D&amp;G produced another good set of figures yesterday and with the OFT's interest in extended warranty business likely to work in the company's favour, there are no obvious clouds on the horizon. D&amp;G looks set to make pre-tax profits of between Pounds 9.3m and Pounds 9.5m for the full year, continuing its strong earnings growth of recent years. A prospective yield of about 2 is half the market's average, but - by contrast - the multiple of about 20 looks undemanding.</p>

			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / The Mood of Britain: It's a nightmare on Acacia Avenue but boom time in Medomsley Road - Michael Cassell finds continued problems in north-east England on the second stage of his pre-election trip around Britain / Tyneside's Meadow Well estate gives the lie to any claims of universal progress and well-being in modern Britain. It defies those who profess to seek remedies for the most intractable social and economic problems THE STREET names conjure up images of suburban, south-east gentility. But Dorking, Didcot and Tonbridge Avenues represent the worst kind of neighbourhood nightmare. Barrack-style terraces of council homes, some boarded up and others burned-out, line the roads at the heart of North Tyneside's Meadow Well estate. Riots here in the autumn brought public uproar and unwelcome notoriety. 'Nothing's changed round here. Nothing likely to,' muses Pat Moore, who cruises the area in a battered flat-bed truck touting for scrap. He laughs through tombstone-sized teeth at a torrent of abuse accusing him of taking anything that is not bolted down. On Tyneside, even sets of temporary traffic lights go missing, kidnapped for use in DIY discos. Moore considers himself lucky not to live on the Meadow Well. He hails from nearby Wallsend, where they launched the Mauretania, the ocean-going liner, fitted out in a luxury unimaginable to its builders. Now, the town is famed as the birthplace of Sting, the pop singer with an inspirational rags-to-riches life story; these days he prefers London's leafy Highgate. Many might suppose that the 'rags-to-riches' order has been reversed in north-east England, once dubbed the cradle of 'carboniferous capitalism', but more recently regarded as a state-dependent province populated by Margaret Thatcher's 'moaning minnies'. While it is not at all representative of a region struggling to break free from its past, the Meadow Well - christened by some hopeful soul unburdened by a sense of irony - reeks of despair and decay. It gives the lie to any claims of universal progress and well-being in modern Britain. It defies those who profess to seek remedies for the most intractable social and economic problems. Only the foolhardy would inquire here about the benefits recent years have brought. On the Meadow Well nearly every home needs jobs and the only benefits come in a book stamped Department of Social Security. The welfare state is thriving here. At the other end of Newcastle upon Tyne lies further deprivation. In the city's West End, tyre tracks burned into the road trace the exploits of daredevil delinquents. Nearly a quarter of children live with only one parent and a similar proportion plays daily truant from school; half of those aged under 24 are out of work. With his wife the only breadwinner, Rakesh Chopra watches over the washing and two noisy children in Westgate Hill Launderette off the Elswick Road. 'I worked very hard but the factory moved away,' he says. 'They said I could go, but there was not a home, so we have to stay.' Rakesh Chopra, it seems, could not get on his bike. Things look brighter just across the Tyne in Gateshead. JB Priestley remarked that if anyone ever made money in Gateshead they had been careful not to spend it there. Now, however, there is the MetroCentre, a vast shopping shrine which has become a cliche for Geordie self-confidence, luring bargain-hunters from as far afield as Oslo and Reykjavik. But in spite of the deep and continuing antipathy in the region towards Thatcher's values, the former prime minister made her mark. The north-east was, reluctantly perhaps, gradually remoulded during her years in power. Joe Mills, regional secretary of the TGWU general workers' union, recalls: 'She came up here and made it clear we'd get nowt for nowt. She said she owed us nothing and if we wanted things to improve we'd have to damn well fight for it.' Mills, a board member of the Tyne and Wear Urban Development Corporation, claims the fight was well under way before Thatcher's handbag swung into town, but he acknowledges the region was stung into renewed action by her attitude. Mills' dual role neatly reflects the progress which has been made to unite parties which traditionally stood on opposite sides of almost any argument. Critics of the new partnership are angered by a perceived betrayal of old allegiances. Promotional slogans such as 'the great north', aimed at the rising number of inward investors, often elicit sneering cynicism. Most people, however, welcome increasing co-operation between industry, councils and regeneration agencies to replace the shipyards, coal mines and heavy-engineering factories. John Ward, regional director of Barclays Bank, says: 'There has been an incredible change in attitudes in the last 10 years. The begging bowl approach has gone. There is real partnership now, with business talking to Labour-controlled councils displaying a refreshing pragmatism. Everyone is pulling in the same direction and the enterprise culture has rubbed off.' Professor Peter Taylor of Newcastle University reckons most people in north-east England spent half the 1980s believing Thatcherism was inherently evil and would just go away. 'Everyone waited for Labour to come back and put things right with large-scale state solutions,' he says. 'But the agenda has changed and now they are trying to get things done for themselves.' John Tomaney, from the city's centre for urban and regional development studies, sees a waning solidarity within the working class between those in employment and those without jobs: 'They all used to stick together and help each other out but now those in work are gradually distancing themselves from the others.' John Lee, a steelworker for 35 years whose skills were scrapped along with the Consett works more than a decade ago, sees it happening all around him. 'My neighbour wasn't young when the plant shut and he has been out of a job ever since. Many things have been pulled down, but they have not been replaced by the training programmes and cash needed to rebuild jobs and lives.' He admits that, in the good old bad old days, unions and management spent most of their energies fighting each other and needed their heads banging together. But he still claims Consett did not need to close. For some, new opportunities arose out of misfortune. Lee now works as a probation officer in Consett, where the clinging red dust from the steel works finally lifted to reveal a new generation of biotechnology companies, plastics manufacturers and food processing specialists; for special steels now read Phileas Fogg tortilla chips, produced by Derwent Valley Foods of Medomsley Road. The victims of some closures have tried to make it on their own, using redundancy cash and enterprise allowance funds to run fish and chip shops or sub-post offices. For some the gamble was regarded more as a last resort than a confident, new beginning. Many would-be entrepreneurs quickly fail. Not all, however. Six years ago, a redundant Robin Edgell set up a small laundry service supplying companies around Durham. He has no regrets: 'I'm not much better off and work twice as hard but I love being my own boss.' Edgell says he used to vote Labour but now they are 'too quick to give with one hand and take back with the other'. He adds: 'They talk as though reasonable people won't mind paying a bit more tax. I'm sorry but I want to pay less.' Edgell would next like to try supplying the new industrial giants such as Nissan at Washington. At the gates of the car manufacturing fortress, workers decline to talk about employers with alien names and attitudes: 'Can't slag them off any more. They take it too personally.' Further south, away from the land of the rising sun and the single-union deal, lies Sacriston, a dismal, hilltop village where coalmining started in 1350 and ended in 1985. An old pit wheel stands in the town centre as a reminder of things past. Ian Tressler, a young storeman who wants to live in London, says Japanese employers would be very welcome locally: 'We'll get karaoke down the pub and make them feel at home. If they bring jobs with them, they'll never have to buy their own pint.' The rest of the articles in Michael Cassell's series will appear throughout this week.</p>

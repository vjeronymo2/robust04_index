			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih,  chairman of the Presidential Council, today received the  ambassadors of the permanent member states of the UN Security  Council and discussed with them the latest developments in our  country in light of the secessionist rebel gang's continuing  violations of the cease-fire decision and its refusal to comply  with Security Council Resolution No. 924. He referred to the  numerous opportunities provided for that criminal gang to cease  fire and end the shedding of Yemeni blood. The latest of these  opportunities, he said, was the one provided for the fifth time  to that gang this morning. Yet, he added, the gang continues  its violations and its aggression against our Armed Forces,  which observed the cease-fire decision and complied with the  Security Council's resolution.    The brother president explained that by repeatedly violating  the cease-fire, that gang is trying to bring in international  observers and to internationalize the Yemeni crisis, pointing  out that some states hostile to Yemen's unity are flagrantly  interfering in Yemen's domestic affairs and encouraging the  secessionist rebels to prolong the current conflict, in the  implementation of plans to disrupt Yemeni unity. He said our  Yemeni people absolutely reject any interference in their  internal affairs and will firmly confront it, as well as all  plans hostile to their unity and their democratic course.    President Salih then expressed his confidence that the  permanent member states of the UN Security Council will take a  firm and clear position toward these acts of interference in  Yemen's domestic affairs, based on their support for Yemen's  unity and its democratic pluralism. He said unity and democracy  are the basis for stability in Yemen, stressing that they will  never be relinquished because they are the true basis for a new  Yemen--a basis which will realize the aspirations of our Yemeni  people and which is in harmony with the trends of the new world  order.    He reaffirmed our country's commitment to Security Council  Resolution No. 924, as well as its decision to provide every  possible support to make the fact-finding mission of brother  Lakhdar Brahimi, envoy of the UN secretary general, successful.    For their part, the ambassadors reaffirmed their countries'  support for unity and democracy in our country, as well as their  readiness to support every effort for a cease-fire and to  implement the Security Council's resolution regarding the  Republic of Yemen. The meeting was attended by brother Yahya  Husayn al-'Arashi, minister of civil service and administrative  reform.    Today, as well, the brother chairman of the Presidential  Council received the ambassadors of the Arab Maghreb Union  member states to our country and discussed with them issues  pertaining to relations between our country and the Arab Maghreb  Union member states. They also reviewed developments in our  country in light of the secessionist rebel gang's criminal acts  against the homeland and the people, after it triggered war and  infighting among the sons of the one Yemeni homeland.    The brother president explained to the brother ambassadors  that the secessionist rebel gang is continuing to violate the  cease-fire decision. It is flagrantly challenging the national  consensus and international will, although that criminal gang  has been given many chances to end the bloodshed in Yemen. But,  he said, it continues its aggression on our country while it  invites other parties' hostility to Yemen in order to enable the  enemies of the homeland to interfere in Yemen's internal affairs  as part of a secessionist, criminal plan to disrupt the Yemeni  homeland.    The brother president then expressed his appreciation of the  principled, firm pan-Arab positions of the Arab Maghreb Union  member states and their support for their brothers in Yemen and  for the march of Yemen's unity and democracy, which constitute a  basis for stability in Yemen and the region and which will  entrench higher pan-Arab goals. He expressed his confidence  that these positions will continue for the benefit of Yemen and  the Arab nation.    The meeting was attended by Yahya Husayn al-'Arashi,  minister  of civil service and administrative reform.</p>

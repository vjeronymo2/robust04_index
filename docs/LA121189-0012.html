			<p><P> December 11, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHALLENGES TO PROPOSITION 13  </P> <P> We moved here just after the passage of Prop. 13 and bought a home in Los  Angeles. I was amazed that nobody seemed to realize that the new tax break for  homeowners discriminated against us new owners.  </P> <P> But then, who cared about new buyers -- buying at inflated prices -- as long as  the original settlers kept their status quo.  </P> <P> Of course, the tax rate should stay at 1%, but all property should be appraised  equally. I cannot understand why it should be such an issue. Equality is so  easy to comprehend.  </P> <P> For those financially strapped senior citizens who would find it difficult to  pay a fair share of the taxes, there is a state program which permits them to  withhold all property taxes until the house is sold.  </P> <P> Since my tax base is different from that of people who purchased their homes  before 1978, I feel that we are being discriminated against -- most unfairly.  </P> <P> NATALIE MILLER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

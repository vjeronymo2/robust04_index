			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report "From Data of the Russian State Committee on </F> Statistics": "Numerical Strength and Wages of Workers and Other  Employees in Industry of the Russian Federation in 1993"]    [Text] In 1993 the number of workers and other employees  working in industry totalled 19 million. Over half of them (55  percent) worked at enterprises of state or municipal ownership,  a third--at enterprises with mixed form of ownership, and 11  percent--at private enterprises (in 1992 these figures were 57  percent, 33 percent, and 10 percent, respectively).    While production volume decreased 16 percent in 1993, the  number of employees in the sector diminished by 5 percent. This  is related to the fact that enterprises are in no hurry to  reduce their excess labor force, hoping that current economic  difficulties are temporary in nature.    Even under conditions of shortages of materials, raw  materials, fuel, and component parts, and problems in the  marketing of production output, many enterprises, in their  striving to retain personnel, are effecting transition to  operations with reduced work periods and are affording employees  supplemental unpaid or partially paid leave.    As of 1 January 1994, more than 7 percent of the people  employed in industry were working less-than-full work periods.  This includes 14 percent of workers in the light industry sector  and 11 percent of those in machine building.    From 5 to 14 percent monthly of the workers at enterprises  where work was halted were on supplemental leave at the  initiative of the administration. For workers in light industry,  this figure reached up to 20 percent for certain months.    The following table characterizes the data on changes in  numerical strength and wage level of employees in the main  sectors of industry in 1993:                     Strength increase (+)     Average monthly wage                   or decrease (-)                    Number of   Percentage    In         In          Factor of                   workers,    of 1992       rubles,    rubles,     increase:                   1993        level         1993       December    1993 over                                                        1993        1994 [as                                                                    published]   Industry         -977,700    -4.8          64,000     145,700     9.0  (total)   including:   Electric power   +44,200     +6.8          120,400    298,800     9.3  industry   Fuel industry    +28,300     +2.4          137,700    339,700     8.6   Ferrous          +3,500      +0.4          78,600     158,500     8.3  metallurgy   Nonferrous       +4,900      +0.7          111,600    263,300     8.1  metallurgy   Chemical and     -49,500     -3.7          56,700     116,500     7.8  petrochemical  industry   Machine          -814,200    -9.2          46,800     103,300     9.3  building and  Metalworking   Lumber,          -136,400    -7.6          52,900     120,700     8.2  woodworking,  and pulp and  paper industry    Building         -56,500     -5.9          65,500     141,400     9.9  materials  industry   Light industry   -83,600     -4.6          42,400     86,100      7.9    Food industry    +17,600     +1.2          78,500     177,500     9.9      Under the influence of intensified sector wage  differentiation, the level of wages in the fuel industry and  electric power industry in 1993 being triple the wages in light  industry and machine building (in 1991 the factor increase was  1.5- to 1.7-fold), an intersector modulation of numbers of  employees is taking place. This is increasing appreciably in the  electric power industry and fuel industry, and decreasing in the  lumber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industry.</p>

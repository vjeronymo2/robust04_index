			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, Jan 04, BNS - A meeting between Boris  Pastukhov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, and his Lithuanian  counterpart Albinas Januska took place Tuesday [4 January] in  Moscow, the press service of the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow  told BNS.    The ministers discussed Lithuania's rights to buildings of  diplomatic missions in Paris, Rome and Moscow. The buildings  belonged to Lithuania before 1940, but after Lithuania's  annexation by the Soviet Union they passed into the hands of  some Soviet organizations. The Lithuanian embassy building in  Paris was taken over by the APN news agency, and the Soviet  embassy in Italy moved into the building of the Lithuanian  embassy in Rome. Lithuania insists on the return of the  buildings.    The meeting also touched on the question of rooms of the  Russian diplomatic mission in Vilnius. It is currently located  in an old administrative building, which the Russian diplomats  claim to be unsuitable for their work. The situation is  complicated because Vilnius did not belong to Lithuania until  the country's occupation by the Soviet Union, and so no Soviet  embassy existed there.    This was the first time the foreign ministries of the two  countries discussed the problem of the Lithuanian embassies in  Moscow, Paris and Rome and the Russian embassy in Vilnius in  their complexity. The Russian side previously refused to  consider restoration of the buildings in Paris and Rome to  Lithuania.    The meeting was "constructive and positive," stated the  official press release of the Lithuanian Embassy in Moscow. "The  parties will draw their final conclusions during future  meetings," the officials said.    After the talks with Pastukhov, Januska met with Sergey  Krylov, a Russian deputy foreign minister, to discuss the  relations between Lithuania and Russia, particularly the  problems related to the Russian Kaliningrad enclave.</p>

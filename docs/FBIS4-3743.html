			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporters Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486) and Zhu Guoxian </F> (2612 0948 6343)]    [Text] Hangzhou, 14 April (XINHUA)--Hangzhou city's public  security organ held a public meeting to deal with 49 hoodlums  who were arrested recently.    The number of Chinese and foreign tourists visiting Hangzhou  has gradually increased during this sightseeing season. In  light of the increasing number of hoodlums in the city,  Hangzhou's public security organ launched a drive to crack down  on them in March. Over the past 40 days and more, the city has  tracked down 132 cliques and arrested 692 gangsters. After  cracking down on these evil doers, public order in scenic spots,  amusement parks, and fairs has markedly improved.    It was learned that based on investigations, the public  security organ has uncovered 796 criminal cases including 301  major cases. Public security personnel also confiscated 14 guns,  227 knives, and other weapons used for criminal purposes,  eliminating the hidden dangers that threaten public security and  order to a great extent.</p>

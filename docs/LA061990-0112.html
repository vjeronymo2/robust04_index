			<p><P> June 19, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PATHE SAYS TALKS TO BUY MGM ARE CONTINUING  </P> <P> Pathe Communications late Monday said it was "continuing discussions" about  details of a plan under which Time Warner Inc. is to back Pathe's $1.2-billion  bid for MGM/UA Communications Co., despite widespread reports that the talks  had broken down.  </P> <P> Beverly Hills-based Pathe also confirmed earlier reports that it might extend a  June 23 deadline by which it was supposed to conclude its $20-a-share tender  offer for MGM/UA.  </P> <P> Pathe shares fell 50 cents to $3.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, while  MGM/UA shares dropped 37.5 cents to $18.25 amid persistent rumors that Time  Warner was pulling out of a deal under which it is to provide $650 million of  Pathe's financing.  </P> <P> "They're still on," one top Warner executive said of the talks.  </P> <P> Another individual close to the discussions said: "We have something between a  happy marriage and what you're hearing (about a breakdown in negotiations)."  </P> <P> Pathe President Giancarlo Parretti has been struggling to conclude financing  arrangements for the MGM/UA acquisition, which had been scheduled to close  earlier this month.  </P> <P> In Monday's statement, Pathe said a separate company owned by Pathe Chairman  Florio Fiorini, Sasea Holding, had failed to conclude a sale of shares in Banca  Agricola Milanese to Centro Nord Commissionaria, which was to have provided $52  million in financing for the deal. But Sasea and another company owned by  Parretti raised the financing by selling other securities, Pathe said.  </P></p>

			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Capital Markets: Growth in rating agencies serving emerging markets The number of credit rating agencies in emerging markets has grown rapidly in recent months, according to a new Financial Times quarterly directory published this week*. The publication lists for the first time in one publication more than 3,000 ratings assigned to emerging market debt issues by 10 international and 20 local rating agencies, many of which have been formed in the last year. Several other local agencies are beginning operations and the directory plans to expand its coverage in future issues. 'Regulators of emerging markets view credit ratings as an effective way of tackling problems of transparency in their jurisdictions,' said Mr Peter Elstob, editor. 'Investors have already taken on board political or country risks but this is the first time they have had access to local perceptions of the borrowers' credit risk.' Agencies including Standard &amp; Poor's, Duff &amp; Phelps and IBCA are active in providing technical support to the newer agencies. Financial Times Credit Ratings in emerging markets cumulatively updated every three months. FT Newsletter Marketing, Southwark Bridge, London. Price Pounds 550 per year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 27 KYODO -- A Ministry of Finance panel  will propose the introduction of an indirect tax aimed  specifically at preserving the environment, ministry sources  said Friday [27 May].    The proposal by a working group of the Institute of Fiscal  and Monetary Policy, a think tank affiliated with the Finance  Ministry, will be part of a package of recommendations on how to  create a more environmentally friendly society through fiscal  and monetary policy.    In a final report on the theme, to be issued in late June,  the group will also urge the government and private firms to be  more concerned with environmental conservation in their  activities.    The proposed indirect environment tax would be added to the  prices of manufactured goods, with the tax ratio set depending  on the amounts of energy used to make the products.    The group will also recommend that private firms disclose  data relating to their activities both benign and harmful to the  environment, such as the amount of industrial waste generated  and the amount of investment made for ecology preservation.    It will also ask the government as well as private banks to  lend more to ecology-protecting projects and less to those  focused only on economic interests.    Other ideas to be included in the report are the  introduction  of garbage-collecting fees and a review of the current farming  methods that depend heavily on chemicals.</p>

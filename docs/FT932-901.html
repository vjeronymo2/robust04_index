			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Profits fall at atomic energy body THE United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority yesterday announced a 30 per cent fall in operating profits as it awaits a government decision on whether it will be privatised. Mr John Maltby, the departing chairman, said the government would have to pay for decommissioning the historic nuclear research installations if it wanted to sell off the group. 'It is difficult to privatise anything with unquantified liabilities, particularly in the decommissioning area', he said. AEA said that it had a 'letter of understanding' from the Department of Trade and Industry that it would meet the bill. The same dilemma about how to split off past nuclear liabilities upset electricity privatisation three years ago. The authority, which now trades as AEA Technology, shows decommissioning liabilities of Pounds 14.3m in its balance sheet. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, said there were other activities which 'you could say don't really belong' if the group were sold. He cited the 500-strong police force AEA employs for security at sites now run by British Nuclear Fuels. Recession and a drop in government nuclear work cut group turnover in the year to March 1993 from Pounds 425m to Pounds 415m, and cut operating profits from Pounds 33m to Pounds 23m. Half the Pounds 61.6m of exceptional costs was due to redundancy, AEA said. Staff numbers fell in the year from 9,187 to 8,022. The group plans a further 500 redundancies this year. Infrastructure renewal - upgrading decades-old electricity and air conditioning systems - also accounted for Pounds 34.2m of the exceptional costs. Mr Brian Eyre, chief executive, rejected suggestions that AEA was clearing its books ahead of privatisation. Sir Anthony Cleaver, the former chairman of IBM UK, will take over the chairmanship on July 4.</p>

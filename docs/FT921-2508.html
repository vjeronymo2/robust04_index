			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Banks support Porth as it warns of deficit With its share price bumping along the bottom at 5p, Porth Group, the USM-quoted Christmas decorations maker, issued a statement yesterday to clarify its position, writes Ivor Duce. The group warned of losses for the full year but said there were early indications of some upturn in orders for the 1992 season. Directors said however that it was necessary to fund the cost of stock build-up to satisfy the Christmas market for 1992 and they therefore announced that agreement in principle had been reached with their bankers to extend the facilities considered necessary to support immediate requirements for working capital. Immediately following the announcement yesterday the shares rose 2p to 7p before ending the day  1/2 p up at 5 1/2 p.</p>

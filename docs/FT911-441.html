			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Martens on move to the heart of Europe: The Belgian PM's plan to change constituencies IF you're the European Community's longest-serving premier, it's a little bit undignified to be accused of running scared. Nobody would have dared level such a charge at Margaret ('I fight, I fight on to win') Thatcher; as an interview revealed this week, Britain's ex-leader comforts herself with the knowledge that she was 'never defeated by the people'. But Belgium's premier, Mr Wilfried Martens - Mrs Thatcher's successor as the EC's longest-serving PM - suffered the ignominy of coming second in his constituency at the last election. In the UK he might have been denied an eighth term; under Belgium's electoral system he retained his seat. Political opponents and commentators say fear of defeat was the real reason why Mr Martens announced yesterday that he would switch constituencies for the next election, due on January 19 1992. He will head the candidate list for the Flemish Christian Democrats (CVP) in Brussels, ending 17 years as member for Ghent in the Belgian chamber of representatives. 'These insinuations show that some politicians will do everything in their power to dissuade me from my task and to put my decision in the wrong light,' griped Mr Martens, announcing his candidature for Brussels' elected upper chamber, the Senate. Mr Martens wants another four-year term so he can complete the third phase of Belgian constitutional reform. However, as a committed Europhile, his 'deeper motivation' is that he wants to spearhead efforts to bring all the EC institutions to Brussels, most notably the European Parliament, which Strasbourg and the Belgian capital are squabbling over. Hence his choice of constituency, and his decision not to be tempted into the race for next president of the European Commission. 'If we don't win this fight over the site of the Parliament then it goes without saying that the other political institutions (the Commission and the Council of Ministers) will leave Brussels,' he warned yesterday. This clearly cuts no ice with Mr Guy Verhofstadt, the young leader of the Flemish Liberals, who pipped Mr Martens to the post in Ghent four years ago. 'Le wonder boy' told Flemish television this week that he considered these were 'phoney arguments' aimed at veiling Mr Martens' retreat from Ghent's Flemish electorate. In fact, by standing in Brussels, Mr Martens should increase CVP support in the bilingual, bicultural capital. But an interesting campaign is still in prospect. The constituency chosen is equally divided between Flemings and French-speaking Walloons, and although Brussels natives seem indifferent to the festering issue of where the European Parliament should sit, there is nothing they enjoy more than a nice helping of Fleming-Walloon friction.</p>

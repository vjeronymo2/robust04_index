			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondents Zhu Dongju (2612 0392 5468) and </F> Luo Guojun (7482 0948 7486)]    [Text] Beijing, 16 Mar (XINHUA) -- In his speech at the  third Plenary Meeting of the Second Session of the Eighth  National Committee of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC], CPPCC member Li Ganliu, vice  chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee  of the Chinese Kuomintang [RCCK], addressed the Kuomintang [KMT]  authorities in Taiwan on behalf of the RCCK Central Committee in  connection with the great cause of China's reunification: The  principle of "peaceful reunification, one country and two  systems," proposed by the CPC, is the only correct way to solve  the Taiwan issue.    Li Ganliu said: This policy reflects the will of the people  of all nationalities across the country; embodies the CPC's  sincerity and goodwill; takes cares of history and reality;  takes into account the interests of the people of all walks of  life in Taiwan; and is in line with the national conditions and  wishes of the people.    Li Ganliu pointed out: Since the beginning of last year,  significant changes have taken place in relations between the  two sides of the Taiwan Strait and in the situation of peaceful  reunification. The mainstream in the development of the  situation is a positive one, which manifests itself mainly as  follows: Cross- Strait economic ties are becoming closer, and a  pattern of economic and trade development characterized by  mutual complementarity and mutual benefit has initially taken  shape. Contacts between personnel of both sides are becoming  more frequent, with the level of contact rising steadily;  exchanges have entered a new stage in which extensive and  in-depth discussions have been conducted in various branches of  learning. Progress made in the "Wang-Ku talks" has contributed  to an historic stride forward in standardizing and  institutionalizing cross-Strait exchanges. Finally, the white  paper on "The Taiwan Issue and China's Reunification," published  in a timely manner by the State Council, demonstrates the  Chinese Government's principled stand and basic principle for  solving the Taiwan issue; thereby safeguarding state sovereignty  and territorial integrity, solemnly repudiating the fallacies on  "two Chinas," "one China, one Taiwan," as well as "Taiwan  independence," and invoking a strong response at home and abroad.    "However, some new negative factors unfavorable to peaceful  reunification are increasing within the island of Taiwan,  enhancing obstacles to the development of cross-Strait  relations." Li Ganliu said: In the past year or so, on the one  hand the KMT authorities on Taiwan have continued to pursue its  unpopular mainland policy to seriously interfere with the  further development of cross-Strait relations and to obstruct  the opening of "Three links" between the two sides; on the other  hand, internationally, the KMT authorities have been pursuing  more intensively their separatist policy known as "a phased  two-China policy," and vigorously launched their "money  offensive" and "elastic diplomacy" tactics. In particular, last  year the KMT authorities escalated their activities on  "returning to the United Nations" with the aim of winning "dual  representation," and recently they launched their so-called  "vacation diplomacy." Facts have proven that the KMT authorities  on Taiwan have not changed their erroneous stand on the question  of reunification at all. If this situation continues, they will  never be able to free themselves from being passive, and they  will become more and more isolated.    Li Ganliu stressed: Mr. Sun Yat-sen pointed out long ago  that "In the face of the mighty tidal current of the world,  those who bow before it survive and those who resist perish."  Reunifying the motherland to invigorate the Chinese nation is  the common aspiration of the Chinese people, including the  compatriots in Taiwan as well as the Chinese nationals overseas,  and is an irresistible historical trend. If the KMT in Taiwan  is not blinded by its own interest but is willing to be a  responsible political party, it should put the interest of the  nation above all else, conform to the trend of the times and the  desire of the people, and make a correct choice. The stalling  tactics it has been adopting in an attempt to seek temporary  comfort and ease will not last long. Its attempt to create "two  Chinas" in a disguised form by relying on foreign forces is  doomed to fail. A reliable guarantee to ensure a sustained  development of Taiwan's economy is to rely on the mainland and  to maintain a mutually beneficial and mutually supplementary  relationship with it. The KMT authorities in Taiwan should  reach an appropriate conclusion after weighing the advantages  and disadvantages.    Li Ganliu said: China's affairs should be solved by the  Chinese people themselves. The Taiwan issue is an internal  affair of China. We strongly support our government's just stand  in safeguarding national dignity and opposing interference by  any external forces. A wise policy for the KMT authorities in  Taiwan to adopt is to cast away illusion, look facts squarely in  the face, change their attitude, be sincere, accept the proposal  of the CPC, agree to establishing the "three links" as soon as  possible, and conduct talks between the KMT and CPC. So long as  consensus on the reunification of the motherland is reached, all  problems can be solved through consultations. The Revolutionary  Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang shares historical origins  with the KMT on Taiwan, and has a responsibility to promote the  reunification of the motherland. At this important juncture, we  would like to sincerely offer our advice. We hope the KMT  authorities in Taiwan will think carefully and make a decision  in the interest of the country and nation, so as to bring a  bright future for the people of Taiwan and write a new page in  the annals of the KMT.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg/Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- The British Prime  Minister John Major does not think the planned European monetary  union will come about. In 1999, Europe will "not yet be ready  for a common currency," Major said in an interview in the news  magazine DER SPIEGEL. This view was "not a piece of British  chauvinism, but an economic assessment."    The prime minister stressed his skepticism was due to the  "anticipated economic repercussions." If Europe had a common  currency in 1997, 1998, or 1999 as planned and it was to  succeed, then "all European economic cycles would have to have  become closer to each other and be working efficiently." Major  added: "I know no one who says this can be anything like  achieved. There will therefore be no monetary union."    Meanwhile Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU) announced that  he wanted to reduce the German contributions to the European  Union (EU) in the long term. The Federal Government was taking  all promising steps to improve the German situation, Waigel told  the B.Z. [BERLINER ZEITUNG]. It was "entirely indisputable that  an imbalance in burden-sharing has arisen." This was all the  truer since "Germany is now only in seventh place in the EU  prosperity stakes following unification."    Waigel pointed out that the German net contribution was  around 25 billion German marks [DM] this year. Germany was  therefore covering around 70 percent of the net transfer between  the member states. In 1994, Germany would pay out around DM44  billion to the EU. Some of this would flow back in the form of  payments to German agriculture or as support for eastern  Germany, for example. But Germany's direct EU expenditure was  further augmented by its contribution to ease the burden on the  second largest net contributor, Great Britain. This cost  another DM1.2 to 1.5 billion.    Major conveyed his irritation at the criticism expressed by  the EU parters of his stance on the dispute over blocking  minorities and veto rights in the EU Council of Ministers and  accused them of applying double standards. If necessary,  Germany and France as well as Spain or Italy would defend  "everything they perceive as questions of national interest."  But no one accused them of being anti-European for that.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of armed groups from the jungles, who have  come to realize their wrongdoings and after accepting the work  being undertaken and the genuine goodwill of the State Law and  Order Restoration Council, have been giving up their armed  struggle and surrendering continually with their arms and  ammunitions at various military camps.    During 1-10 May 1994, 26 terrorist insurgents from the ABSDF  [All Burma Students' Democratic Front] armed group in the  southeast military command region, the Pa-O red faction armed  group in the eastern military command region, and the Karen  armed group in the southern military command region, returned to  the legal fold and were warmly welcomed by responsible personnel  concerned at various camps.</p>

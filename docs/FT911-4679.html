			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / International Capital Markets: Swedish firm packages two junk bond deals A SWEDISH investment management firm, Carlson Investment Management, has completed two deals backed by portfolios of junk bonds and placed with US insurance companies. Further deals, to be placed with European investors, are planned. The US high-yield or junk bonds were repackaged to create two issues of collateralised bond obligations (CBO). The first, a Dollars 115m CBO, will be managed by Saudi International Bank. About Dollars 85m of senior bonds were placed with US investors, while Dollars 10m of lower-ranked bonds were bought by Saudi. Carlson will hold the remaining equity. The portfolio yields around 15 per cent, while the new bonds pay interest of just over 10 per cent, providing a substantial cushion for defaults. Although economic recession in the US has increased the level of corporate defaults, many investors now take the view that the worst is over, and are becoming hungry for yield, said Mr Bjorn Carlson, the president of Carlson Investment Management. The second deal was a Dollars 225m package arranged in conjunction with Massachusetts Mutual Life. An issue of Dollars 180m bonds was placed with US insurance companies, with the two arrangers holding the equity. Both issues were rated Double-A2 by Moody's and have an expected life of about eight years.</p>

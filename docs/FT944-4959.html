			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Exceptional checks NIE at Pounds 44.3m A higher than average rise in unit sales as well as cost-cutting helped Northern Ireland Electricity increase interim operating profits 16.5 per cent from Pounds 41.7m to Pounds 48.6m. Pre-tax profit growth was 4.5 per cent, from Pounds 42.4m to Pounds 44.3m, following a Pounds 5.9m exceptional charge for restructuring, mainly to pay for voluntary redundancy. The dividend rises 15 per cent to 3.9p (3.39p) in line with expectations, out of earnings per share after exceptional costs of 21p (20.8p). In the half-year to September 30, NIE's increased turnover of Pounds 209.6m (Pounds 206.2m) was helped by a 6.2 per cent growth in industrial unit sales. The commercial sector increased 4.5 per cent, although domestic growth was less impressive at 1.1 per cent. Taking all three sectors together the weather-corrected increase was 4.6 per cent. The company also benefited from a 13.4 per cent reduction in employee costs. Some 149 jobs were cut in the half, leaving 2,607. It had set a target of 2,557 for March 1996 but expects to meet that in the current financial year. Of the company's four main profit centres, supply showed the highest increase, 78.9 per cent to Pounds 3.4m, but the retail business showed a Pounds 500,000 loss, following a Pounds 200,000 profit in the comparable period. Mr Patrick Heren, chief executive, blamed a fall in appliance sales in a highly competitive market. The company had net cash of Pounds 91.6m at the year end, up from Pounds 35.2m. Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said it was confident the regulator's review of the interconnector with Scotland would show it provided an economic method of purchasing electricity. 'We thought it was the best way forward, even without the Pounds 61m grant from the European Union to help build the interconnector,' he said. COMMENT Had all gone according to the government's plans, NIE would now be a company with considerable gearing. However, a year after privatisation it is treading the well-worn path of privatised utilities, cutting costs ahead of schedule and spending less than expected. As a result the cash pile now stands at Pounds 92m, and profits are healthy. Expenditure on the Scottish interconnector will dent the cash but, assuming a full year dividend of 13p, the shares are trading on prospective yield of 4.4 per cent. That is about the same as the England and Wales regional electricity companies and seems about right. NIE faces an earlier regulatory review than the recs, which increases uncertainty, but uniquely it will benefit from the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>

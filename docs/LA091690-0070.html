			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> BEST BET  </P> <P> Dolphin Park in Carson will take on the sounds and tastes of Mexico today as  the city hosts its 13th annual Mexican Independence Day celebration. The music  of mariachi bands, salsa bands and romantic Latin combos will fill the park  from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., and foods along with arts and crafts will be available  at 20 booths decorated with green, white and red -- the colors of the Mexican  flag.  </P> <P> Eight popular performing groups from Mexico and Central America will entertain  at the park at 21205 Water St. The party will be emceed by Humberto Luna and  other on-air personalities from Spanish-language radio stations KTNQ-AM and  KLVE-FM.  </P> <P> Park director Glenn Salas said that when city budget cuts left him unable to  hire a band for the annual celebration, he appealed for sponsors and the radio  stations responded. "They're bringing all the entertainment and setting up the  stage," he said. "This will put Carson on the Hispanic map."  </P> <P> Youngsters will have their own game booths, and young children will be able to  break pinatas for the candy prizes inside. The Carson Clowners, a group of  senior citizens in clown costumes, will entertain. Booths will be operated by  Carson community, church and cultural organizations, as well as private  vendors. Proceeds from booth rentals will be used for city youth programs.  </P> <P> With several thousand people expected at the fiesta, an elementary school lot  across from the park will augment on-street parking.

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Bonn acts to curb soaring budget deficit: Sharp cuts in welfare spending intended to prompt reduction in interest rates THE German cabinet yesterday approved plans for sharp cuts in social spending and unemployment benefits in an effort to curb the government's soaring deficit and encourage the Bundesbank to continue cutting interest rates. Budget spending for 1994 was fixed at DM478.4bn (Pounds 187.6bn), up 4.4 per cent on the current year, with a forecast borrowing requirement of DM67.5bn  -almost identical to the current deficit. At the same time the cabinet approved a medium-term financial plan to impose a virtual freeze on nominal spending in 1995, and tight restraint until 1997, to reduce the deficit to DM48bn in 1996 and DM38bn by 1997. 'We have laid the foundations for improving the ability of the Bundesbank to cut (interest) rates,' Mr Theo Waigel said after the cabinet meeting, which was attended by both Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, and Mr Otmar Issing, his chief economist. The 1994 budget is based on a forecast growth rate of 1 per cent in western Germany next year, assuming a recovery in the first half of the year. For the whole of Germany, the economy is forecast to decline by 1 per cent this year, and grow by 1.5 per cent in 1994. The budget of the labour ministry, including the payment of unemployment benefit and financing job creation and retraining schemes in eastern Germany, remains by far the largest single element: almost DM122bn, or a quarter of total spending next year. Mr Waigel forecast an unemployment total of 3.75m in 1994, suggesting a continuing rise in joblessness even if the recession bottoms out. He said the aim of the budget, and the medium-term financial plan, was to bring central government spending under control, while still taking action to promote economic recovery. The DM21bn savings package approved for next year includes a cut of three percentage points in unemployment and social assistance benefits, a freeze on pay in the public sector, and a clampdown on social security and tax fraud intended to yield DM6bn. The cuts in spending resulting from the package should produce savings of more than DM28bn in the federal budget by 1996, and more than DM34bn if the 16 federal states are included. The package has antagonised trade unions and the Social Democratic Party, the main opposition party in the German Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. The SPD controls a majority in the Bundesrat, the upper house, but it can only block cuts amounting to 5 per cent of the total package, according to finance ministry officials. The medium-term plan shows the federal budget deficit remaining at the present level of more than DM67bn - or almost 15 per cent of the budget - until 1995, before the spending squeeze and economic recovery bring it back down to 10 per cent of spending by 1996 and under 8 per cent in 1997. Mr Waigel said that the only alternative to the sharp cuts in social benefits would have been to increase the level of borrowing, or to increase taxation during the recession. The former would mean that there would be no room for manoeuvre for the Bundesbank to cut its interest rates further, whereas a further increase in taxation would counteract any hopes of economic recovery.</p>

			<p><P> November 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RIGHTS MEMORIAL UNVEILED IN ALABAMA  </P> <P> A generation after Medgar Evers and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were killed, the  nation's first memorial to martyrs of the civil rights movement was unveiled  Sunday as relatives expressed hope that young people will carry on the spirit  of that turbulent era.  </P> <P> Several people cried as they touched the cool water that flows across a  circular black granite slab engraved with important events of the era,  including the names of 40 people who died in the struggle for racial equality.  </P> <P> The memorial is of the same material and by the same architect as the Vietnam  Veterans Memorial in Washington.  </P> <P> "I hope this will vitalize the struggle, keep it fresh in the minds . . . for  the youth," said Ollie Gordon, a Chicago schoolteacher whose cousin,  14-year-old Emmett Till, was shot to death in 1955 by whites angered that he  had spoken to a white woman.  </P> <P> "I talk about Martin Luther King and ask why we celebrate his birthday, and  many children don't know," she said.  </P> <P> More than 400 law enforcement officers provided security for the dedication  ceremony after relatives viewed the monument.  </P> <P> "It's a very moving experience," said Myrlie Evers of Los Angeles, whose  husband, Medgar, was the highest-ranking NAACP officer in Mississippi when he  was assassinated in 1963. "It says to me that there's hope."  </P> <P> Julian Bond, the first black state lawmaker in Georgia, said it was also  important to remember others besides King and Evers who died in the struggle.  </P> <P> "Without degradating Dr. King, this was a lot more than a Martin Luther King  movement," he said. "Many were ordinary, everyday people who rose above their  ordinariness to make a difference."  </P> <P> The $700,000 monument also honors James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael  Schwerner, who were shot to death during the 1964 Freedom Summer and whose  slayings inspired the movie "Mississippi Burning."  </P> <P> "Poetry in granite" was how Goodman's mother, Carolyn Goodman of New York,  described the memorial designed by Maya Lin.  </P> <P> "Nobody who sees it can (but) feel that it's a moving, moving piece of art,"  Carolyn Goodman said. "It brings that period so vividly alive that you can  almost relive it."  </P> <P> The monument is in front of the Southern Poverty Law Center, a few blocks from  the Alabama Capitol, where Jefferson Davis took the oath of office as president  of the Confederacy in 1861, and near the Baptist church where King started the  Montgomery bus boycott in 1955.  </P> <P> The 9-foot-high granite wall is inscribed with words King chose for his first  speech during the bus boycott: "Until justice rolls down like water and  righteousness like a mighty stream."  </P> <P> Martin Luther King III, a county commissioner in Atlanta, said he thought his  father's words were "very appropriate."  </P> <P> He said the memorial focuses attention on inequalities that still exist and  will serve as a hands-on history lesson for young people.  </P> <P> "Perhaps they can get an understanding of why people lost their lives," King  said.  </P> <P> The law center published a 104-page magazine that tells the story of each  person named on the monument, and copies were sent to schools around the  country.  </P></p>

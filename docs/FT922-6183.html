			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Jobs: Swiss slide below the Brits - How executive pay varies across Europe the ski-lift has definitely gone into reverse. Over nigh on a decade of comparing the buying-power enjoyed by European executives, I became so used to seeing the Swiss soaring high above everybody as to doubt they would ever be knocked off the peak. Indeed, such was their supremacy that even when the Spanish and the Luxembourgeois edged above them 12 months ago, I felt sure they would be back at the top this year. How wrong I was may be seen from the table over to the right: they have been overtaken by their counterparts in yet another four nations, including the United Kingdom. But before commenting further, I'll explain how the table works. As in previous years, it is drawn from the annual survey made by the Wyatt consultancy group's arm in Brussels. The latest version covers 1,470 companies of assorted sizes and activities in 17 European countries, and gives supplementary data on the United States and Turkey. Of the 17 countries, Belgium supplies the biggest sample of companies with 230, the smallest sample being Luxembourg's 36. The study also gives information on pay and perks for nine kinds of specialist directors as well as chief executives, divided into company-turnover bands. All of which is of course far more than I have room for. Anyone wanting the full report can obtain it, at a price, from either Jean-Pierre Becquet at 273 Avenue de Tervuren (Box 4), 1150 Brussels, Belgium; tel (02) 771 99 10, fax (02) 762 37 43: or Don McClune at 21 Tothill St, London SW1H 9LL; tel 071-222-8033, fax 071-222 9182. My extracts are confined to chief executives and just two sorts of other directors, of finance and of personnel, across companies of all sizes in each land. And I have included only the dozen best-paying countries, converting the currencies into sterling at the London closing rates on May 20. In each case, the table gives basic salaries, total money pay including bonuses, and a rough measure of buying power. The three 'lower quartile' columns refer to the executive who'd be a quarter of the way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same job and land, the 'median' trio to the one mid-way, and the 'upper quartile' trio to the one a quarter way down from the top. Then come the standard averages. The buying-power is calculated by taking the total cash pay, deducting the particular country's normal tax and social security charges for a person with the specified income who is married with two dependent children, then adjusting the resulting net pay in line with Wyatt's index of international variances in executives' living costs. Alas, it is a loosely approximate measure at best. The reason is that, since survey companies evidently find it impossible to devise a gauge of housing costs that is consistent across different countries, that central item of spending is left out of account. Nevertheless the index is the best measure available of what pay is worth, and the countries are ranked by the average buying power of the three executives listed. On that criterion, the Spanish hold the top place they gained last year, with the Italians leapfrogging into second place over the Luxembourgeois who rank above the French by dint of paying the two specialist directors better. That is also why the Swiss are higher than the Austrians, although both are now below the UK and in the lower half of the ranking. Among the rest, the Belgians have regained the slight lead over the Dutch which they lost 12 months ago.</p>

Xinjiang has undergone enormous changes in recent years with  those seeking to split the Muslim-majority region from the rest  of China "growing daily in ambition," the Public Security News  [RENMIN GONGAN BAO] quoted Xinjiang's vice-director of police  Abdula Xiti as saying.    The separatists are publicly calling on Muslims in Xinjiang  to fight socialism with Islam and seeking to weaken the unity of  the Chinese state, Abdula said. Anti-Chinese demonstrations --  fuelled by Muslim activists in bordering former Soviet republics  such as Kazakhstan and Tajikistan -- have multiplied in recent  years, causing serious concerns within the Chinese leadership.    Together with Tibet, Xinjiang is viewed by Beijing as a  potential flashpoint for major ethnic unrest in China.    Abdula said it was necessary to use "an iron hand" in  dealing  with the separatists and cracking down on their "illegal  activities."    In December last year, the communist party secretary for  Tibet, Song Hanliang, said the government would take all  necessary steps to suppress separatism spreading in the region.</p>

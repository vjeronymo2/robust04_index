			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] ASD [Democratic Socialism Alternative] Deputy Jerjes  Justiniano has reported the existence of safe houses in Santa  Cruz where DEA agents torture drug traffickers to obtain  information. Minister of Government German Quiroga has denied  this possibility.    [Begin Quiroga recording] Hugo San Martin, a national  government secretary was sent to Santa Cruz. He spent 15, 16,  and 17 January looking for these alleged safe houses together  with the local prefect. They found none. They found places  where the Special Antinarcotics Forces [FELCN] and DEA work, but  they found no safe houses. [end recording]    The minister of government has asked Deputy Justiniano to  provide the address of these safe houses.    [Begin Justiniano recording] Here is the proof. The  newspaper HOY found a safe house in Santa Cruz. Here is the  full address; 240 Rene Moreno Street, opposite Blacutt Square.  The house belongs to Mrs. Pura Bowles de Fernandez. This was  verified by national and Santa Cruz press sources. Journalists  visited this house and confirmed this. What other evidence do  you want? I am not a policeman. It is the duty of the Interior  Ministry to make pertinent investigations. If they do not know  about this, they are either accomplices or foolish. [end  recording]    Minister Quiroga nonetheless insists that safe houses do not  exist because even U.S. Ambassador Bowers has assured him of  this.    [Begin Quiroga recording] I have spoken with the U.S.  Ambassador to express the Bolivian Government's concern over  this subject and he has assured me that such charges are not  true. Neither the DEA nor the U.S. Embassy acknowledge the  existence of this kind of safe houses in the country. [end  recording]    The minister of government reported that he asked Deputy  Justiniano to join the delegation that went to investigate the  existence of these safe houses but that he did not want to  accompany the group.</p>

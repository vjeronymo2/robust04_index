			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Commerzbank advance 15% GROUP earnings at Commerzbank, Germany's third-largest bank, rose by 15 per cent in the first five months of the year, Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, the bank's chief executive, said yesterday. However, partial operating profits - excluding own-account trading profits - remained unchanged compared with the same period last year. The chairman's remarks amplified his observation last month that there had been a 'double-digit' increase in profits between January and May. Mr Kohlhaussen said the growth had come largely from own-account trading in foreign exchange and securities. The unchanged operating profits reflected an 8 per cent increase in administrative costs as well as reduced credit demand from Germany's recession-weakened industrial sector.</p>

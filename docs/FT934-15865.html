			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Two linked to Belling loss charged with Pounds 4.9m fraud TWO MEN LINKED to the loss of Pounds 2.3m from the pension fund of Belling, the cooker manufacturer which collapsed last year, have been charged with defrauding companies and private individuals in Britain and abroad of a total Pounds 4.9m. Mr Charles Deacon, a solicitor based in Newcastle-under-Lyme, and Mr Keith Fuller, a business consultant, were yesterday remanded on conditional bail of Pounds 125,000 and Pounds 100,000 respectively and are due to reappear in court on Friday. The bail, subject to suitable sureties, was granted at Stafford High Court late yesterday following an appeal against the original magistrates' decision to remand the men in custody. The two have been jointly charged with four offences dating back to 1986: obtaining Dollars 3.5m (Pounds 2.3m) by deception from Belling, similarly, Pounds 1.2m from Kristen Nielsen of Denmark, cash and property worth Pounds 880,000 from Bratsklpk of Russia, and Pounds 575,000 from Arbuthnot Leasing International. Three of the four charges state that money was obtained by falsely representing that a fee was an advance payment for a larger loan. They further state that the pair falsely represented that the advance would be held by Mr Deacon's company until credit arrangements had been made. Two years ago Belling sought to arrange a Dollars 50m capital injection through a company called Global Prospect Funding, where Mr Deacon was a director. In advance of the deal, Belling paid Pounds 2.1m as the first year's interest. The company borrowed the money from the pension fund to pay the fee, but the loan never materialised.</p>

			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Pretoria seeks backing for federalist plans SOUTH Africa's ruling National Party will today host a conference of right-of-centre political parties in an attempt to build a united front behind the demand for a federal constitution for post-apartheid South Africa. The issue of federalism - the degree to which political power is devolved to regional and local level in the new South Africa - is likely to prove the most contentious issue to be resolved whenever formal talks on a new constitution resume between the National party and its main black opponent, the African National Congress (ANC). Though the ANC pays lip-service to the concept that power should be devolved to regions, it nevertheless envisages a highly centralised state where most important decisions are taken at central government level. The power to levy taxes would also be highly centralised, undermining further the political power of regional parliaments. The National party, along with federalist allies such as the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, the governments of black homelands such as Bophuthatswana and Ciskei, and some of the many Afrikaner separatist movements, believe that South Africa's highly fractious multi-ethnic society cannot be governed peacefully by a majority party ruling from the centre. Under a federal constitution, these ethnically based minority parties would retain a far greater share of power than in a centralised, unitary state, and for this reason, the ANC remains highly sceptical of such a constitution. ANC officials say government uses federalism as camouflage for its real aim: to preserve white privilege in a black state, by guaranteeing the National party a disproportionately large share of power. Many also oppose federalism because it would give the ANC's arch-rival, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi of the Inkatha Freedom party, probable control over what is now Natal Province (boundaries would be redrawn under a new constitution). The ruling party will today try to counter these criticisms by presenting proposals on how political and fiscal power should be distributed between central, regional and local level. The other main participants at the conference will be Inkatha and other black homeland parties, as well as the new Afrikaner Volksunie party, formed after last month's split in the ultra-right Conservative party. The liberal Democratic party, which has long advocated federalism, will send only an observer delegation; it says it is reluctant to join a National party coalition against the ANC.</p>

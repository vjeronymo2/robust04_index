			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / The Week Ahead RESULTS DUE THE interim results season, which had taken a breather during most of August, springs back to life on Thursday with a clutch of companies reporting. Williams Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is expected to have suffered a fall in half-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 76.5m to around Pounds 73m. Earnings per share are also likely to be down to 10.5p from 10.9p. The interim dividend is expected to be unchanged at 5p. Most of Williams' divisions have been affected by the recession on both sides of the Atlantic and are expected to show a fall in profits. This is expected to more than offset contributions from Yale and Valor, the locks and domestic appliances group, bought last year in an agreed deal. Rolls-Royce, the aircraft engine maker, continues to claw its way back from its dismal interim results last year. Pre-tax profits should be back to nearly Pounds 40m from Pounds 11m a year earlier. A positive factor has been the slow recovery in sales of engine spares. Burmah Castrol, the lubricants, chemicals and fuels company, is expected to announce interim pre-tax profits for the six months to June 30 of about Pounds 78m, resulting in net income after tax and minorities of about Pounds 39m. This compares to profits and net income of Pounds 72.2m and Pounds 33m respectively for the first half of last year. Lubricants, which includes Castrol automotive oils, is expected to have performed well although the chemicals division is expected to be down. Ladbroke should edge ahead about 5 per cent to interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m-Pounds 105m. The picture at none of its main divisions is particularly exciting. T&amp;N is likely to turn in a creditable Pounds 30m in interim pre-tax profits, up from Pounds 20.3m a year earlier. Although the car parts business remains very tough, it has picked up market share and won orders on new vehicle models. Reckitt &amp; Colman, the food and household products maker, has had a static first half with pre-tax profits close to last year's Pounds 128m. Cookson, the materials maker, is also likely to have had a flat first compared with last year's Pounds 34m. But its heavy rationalisation programme of the past year is starting to pay off.

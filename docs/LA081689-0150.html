			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BREWERS' GANTNER TO HAVE SURGERY  </P> <P> The Milwaukee Brewers said today that second baseman Jim Gantner will undergo  surgery to repair severe damage to a ligament in his left knee suffered in a  play at second Tuesday night.  </P> <P> The surgery on the medial collateral ligament was to be done this afternoon by  team physician Dr. Paul Jacobs.  </P> <P> Known for his quick pivots at second base where he was unyielding in the face  of hard-charging baserunners, Gantner had been producing at the plate as well.  He batted .330 since the All-Star break to raise his average to .274.  </P> <P> But as he took a low throw from shortstop Billy Spiers on a potential  double-play grounder in the seventh inning Tuesday night, Gantner was  roll-blocked by the New York Yankees' Marcus Lawton. Umpire Dave Phillips  called an automatic double play because of Lawton's interference.  </P> <P> Second baseman Billy Bates has been called up by the Brewers from their Denver  farm club.  </P></p>

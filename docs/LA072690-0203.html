			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> YOUNGSTERS GET HOOKED ON FISHING  </P> <P> Roman Castillo sat at a picnic table at Irvine Lake near Orange looking  dejected. He had been fishing for hours without so much as a nibble.  </P> <P> At 13, the eighth-grader from Fullerton claimed to be an experienced fisherman  and was frustrated at seeing a novice outdo him.  </P> <P> "Some kid who's never even fished before just threw his pole out there and  caught something," Castillo said, shaking his head. "I just couldn't believe  it. I really want to catch something now."  </P> <P> Castillo wasn't the only angler on the lake Wednesday who failed to hook a  prize. Many of the 500 who participated in the "Fish and Tackle Drugs" youth  fishing competition also came home empty-handed.  </P> <P> But it didn't seem to matter. Most were having fun just learning how to use  their new fishing poles, taking boat rides across the lake, getting their faces  painted and playing carnival games.  </P> <P> The event, organized by the recreation departments of Santa Ana, Orange,  Placentia, Yorba Linda and Fullerton, was designed to expose youngsters to the  lifetime hobby of fishing and to discourage them from getting involved in  drugs, said Larry Chavez, recreation supervisor in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> "This is a good opportunity for them to get out into a new environment and to  expose them to some outdoor activities other than baseball and football,"  Chavez said.  </P> <P> Eliza Tevan, a 10-year-old from Santa Ana, had never fished before. But after  catching a five-inch bluegill, she said she was hooked on the sport.  </P> <P> "I like it more than playing with dolls," she said in Spanish.  </P> <P> But 4-year-old Shaun Little had a hard time Wednesday, because he couldn't find  his fishing pole. Wearing an oversized California Angels baseball cap, the  Orange preschooler wandered around the lake in search of his pole.  </P> <P> "I had it, then I lost it," he said.  </P> <P> The day also featured an appearance by Jimmy Kim, who won a gold medal in tae  kwon do at the 1988 Olympics. Kim said he hoped his participation in the event  would help to steer kids toward high achievement and away from drugs.  </P> <P> "I think kids need positive role models," Kim said. "There are so many bad role  models out there. I'd like to see all of these kids find something they really  enjoy and become good at it. If they set goals and work towards achieving those  goals, they won't have time for drugs." GREG HERNANDEZ  </P></p>

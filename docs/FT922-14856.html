			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Government Bonds: Tokyo takes fright as economic message comes home THE Japanese government bond market caught a fright yesterday. The tumbling Tokyo stock market and a weakening yen finally brought home the message the market had been struggling to digest the day before: that this week's fiscal package and cut in the official discount rate are unlikely to make much difference to the worsening Japanese economy. The result was a heavy sell-off in the government bond market in the afternoon as rumours of heavy selling sent waves of panic through the market. By the close, the market had recovered some of the lost ground, but was still looking badly battered, with bonds at yields around their highest for the year so far. 'There's not a lot of news - there's just rumour and panic,' one trader said. 'The market is in a state of confusion and shock.' The benchmark bond 129 tumbled during the day, with the yield jumping sharply from 5.42 per cent at the opening to 5.71 per cent at one stage as panic set in. A later recovery brought it back to close around 5.5 per cent, though the price continued to slide during the London trading day, with the yield rising to 5.55 per cent. The gloom over the yen and the state of the stock market suggest further falls are in store. Mr Neil McKinnon, an economist with Yamaichi in London, said yields were likely to rise to 6 per cent by the summer, while further interest rate cuts to support the equity market would take the official discount rate down to 3 per cent. THE FRENCH government bond market got what it wanted yesterday - and promptly reacted with a sharp bout of selling. Mrs Edith Cresson's resignation as prime minister, and her replacement by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, were just what traders had been hoping for. The French bond futures contract closed down 0.08 at 107.26. Cash bonds were left once more yielding around 72 basis points more than their German equivalents, in part due to a quiet day for the bund market. (While the German cash market remained steady, trading in a narrow range, bund futures gained on the day, closing up at 87.21 after opening at 87.06.) Where the French market goes from here depends in part on who will succeed Mr Beregovoy at the finance ministry. Although there is a feeling in some quarters that the prime minister will double up as finance minister, a more expected move would be that of Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the governor of the Bank of France. That would be a popular choice with the market. FOREIGN investors have rediscovered some appetite for Italian bonds this week. The latest auction of 10-year bonds on Tuesday saw strong foreign buying, according to several bankers - in part to square short positions in the futures market. With political uncertainty over this weekend's elections, and little cheer on the economic front, Italian government bonds have lost ground in the last fortnight. They had tightened by around 0.5 percentage point against bunds during the year so far, reaching a spread of 2.9 per cent, before falling again to 3.2 per cent. This week's buying interest and a relaxed monetary stance yesterday, have helped to bring back a firmer tone to the market. US TREASURY prices fell slightly at both ends of the yield curve yesterday as traders and investors continued to tread gently ahead of today's important jobs report for March. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  7/32 at 100 15/16 , yielding 7.911 per cent. The short end was also weaker, with the two-year note down  1/32 at 100 13/32 , yielding 5.515 per cent. The only economic news of the day - initial jobless claims up 9,000 in the third week of March and a 0.5 per cent rise in February factory orders - had no effect on sentiment because the market had its eyes firmly fixed on today's employment data. The forecast is for a rise in non-farm payrolls of between 45,000 and 70,000, which would represent a continuation of the trend for a modest improvement in labour conditions. AFTER losing its nerve on Wednesday over fears of an imminent change of government, the UK government bond market yesterday regained some of its composure. Traders gathered enough confidence to mark bond prices up slightly on the day. The benchmark 9 per cent maturing in 2011 gained nearly  1/4 point on the day, closing up at 94 1/32 , a yield of 9.68 per cent. THE UK government bond market was the worst performing market last month in both sterling and dollar terms, according to figures supplied by JP Morgan and Kemper Investment Management, writes Simon London. A portfolio of gilts gave sterling-based investors a negative return of about 2.5 per cent over the month, as pre-election jitters sent bond prices lower. For an international US dollar-based investor, the outcome was worse still: a negative return of over 3.5 per cent.</p>

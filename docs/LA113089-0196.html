			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 2 HOUSES ARE DAMAGED BY FIRE  </P> <P> A wind-whipped fire Wednesday caused extensive damage to one house and moderate  damage to another before Orange County firefighters doused the flames.  </P> <P> The fire broke out at 8:19 a.m. and caused about $130,000 damage to the house  at 10381 Perdido St. in an unincorporated county area between Anaheim and  Stanton, county fire spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said.  </P> <P> The fire was believed to have been caused by lint buildup in a clothes dryer.  Resident Tom Riley discovered the fire, and he and his wife, Hilaire, managed  to escape unharmed, Cha said.  </P> <P> Winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. blew embers onto the house next door, starting a  fire that blew out windows and charred one wall, causing about $12,000 damage,  authorities said. It took about 25 firefighters 30 minutes to extinguish the  blazes, Cha said.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For all respondents, we based USP on purchase price, in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act, because lighters were sold directly to unrelated parties in the United States prior to importation into the United States, and because exporter's sales price (``ESP'') methodology was not indicated by other circumstances.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated purchase price based on packed, FOB foreign-port prices to unrelated purchasers in the United States, and packed, CIF prices, where appropriate. We made deductions for foreign inland freight, containerization, loading, port handling expenses, and marine insurance, as indicated. Generally, costs for these items were valued in the surrogate country. However, where inland freight was purchased from market economy suppliers and paid for in a market economy currency, we used the cost actually incurred by the exporter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 773(c) of the Act, we calculated FMV based on factors of production reported by the factories in the PRC which produced the subject merchandise for the five responding exporters. The factors used to produce lighters include materials, labor and energy. To calculate FMV, the reported factor quantities were multiplied by the appropriate surrogate values from Indonesia for those inputs purchased domestically from PRC suppliers. Where inputs were imported from market economy countries and paid for in a market economy currency, we used the actual costs incurred by the producers to value those factors (see,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Oscillating Ceiling Fans From the People's Republic of China, 56 FR 55271, October 25, 1991). Where a respondent failed to provide certain factor information in a usable form, we have used publicly available information from the petition and other respondents as best information available in valuing these factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cli-Claque has argued that since it purchases certain input parts produced in the PRC from a Hong Kong reseller, the Department should accept these prices as market-determined and use them when calculating FMV. We disagree with this argument and have not used the prices for these inputs in calculating FMV. For purposes of valuing factors of production, it is the Department's practice not to use prices from one PRC producer to an unrelated PRC producer because those prices are distorted. In the present case, the two Hong Kong companies negotiated prices for inputs produced in the PRC on behalf of their related production facilities located in the PRC. Therefore, we have determined that these input prices should not be used to value the factors of production in this case. We have only used prices for imported inputs which were produced in market-based economies to value those factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In determining which surrogate value to use for each factor of production which was not sourced from a market-economy country, we selected, where possible, from publicly available, published information (``PAPI'') which was: (1) an average non-export value; (2) representative of a range of prices within the POI if submitted by an interested party, or most contemporaneous with the POI; (3) product-specific; and (4) tax-exclusive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With the exception of butane, we used the Indonesian import price taken from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports, November 1993. For butane, however, the amount imported into Indonesia was negligible compared to the amount exported from that country. Therefore, for those PRC producers that did not import butane from market economy sources, we relied on Indonesian export statistics, as reported in the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Exports, November 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We used Indonesian transportation rates taken from a September 18, 1991, U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia to value inland freight between the source of the production factor and the disposable lighter factories.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value electricity, we used public information from the Electric Utilities Data Book for the Asian and Pacific Region (January 1993) published by the Asian Development Bank. To value labor amounts, we used labor rates published by the Bureau of International Labor Affairs, U.S. Department of Labor, in Foreign Labor Trends-Indonesia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We adjusted the factor values, when necessary, to the POI using wholesale price indices (``WPIs'') published by the International Monetary Fund (``IMF'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To value factory overhead, we calculated percentages based on a December 2, 1994 U.S. State Department cable from the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta giving elements of industry group income statements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For general expense percentages, we used the statutory minimum of 10 percent of materials, labor, and overhead costs calculated for each factory. For profit we used the statutory minimum of eight percent of materials, labor, factory overhead, and general expenses. We did not have Indonesian values for either general expenses or profit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We added packing based on Indonesian values obtained from the Indonesian Foreign Trade Statistical Bulletin_Imports, November 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Cli-Claque argues that since it makes all of its sales/exports from Hong Kong, has all of its management, administrative and selling operations in Hong Kong, and is wholly-owned and operated as a market-economy producer, we should treat Cli-Claque as a market-economy producer and base FMV on Hong Kong home market prices. Failing this, Cli-Claque maintains that since the PRC production facility does not know Cli-Claque's customers or the ultimate destination of the merchandise and since the products enter the commerce of Hong Kong, we should, at a minimum, consider Cli-Claque as a third country reseller and consider Hong Kong a viable home market on which to base FMV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We disagree with Cli-Claque on both accounts. First, its related production facility is located in a non-market economy country and, therefore, the FMV of the subject merchandise must be determined using the factors of production methodology. Second, given the relationship between Cli-Claque and the PRC production facility, we do not consider that there is a ``purchase'' from the PRC production facility by Cli-Claque within the meaning of section 773(f) of the Act. Therefore, Cli-Claque is not considered a ``reseller'' within the meaning of that provision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Boris Lysenko: "Germans Pack Up and Leave </F> Kazakhstan"]    [Text] Berlin -- According to official figures, there are  700,000 Germans living in Kazakhstan. Many have already left --  300,000 people did so in 1993 alone. Even more are planning to  leave.    One-half of the 17-million population of the [world's] ninth  largest state are members of ethnic minorities, and ethnic  tension is on the rise.    There are varying reasons for potential conflict. Konstantin  Erlikh, chairman of the Republic's "German Rebirth" Society,  explains why people want to leave Kazakhstan. It is not only a  case of economic necessity, but also of the "Kazakhization of  the country," which does not promise ethnic minorities a  political future. This is also compounded by the problem of  citizenship.    In a country rich in fuel resources people are freezing and  suffering for want of food. Anyone who is able to leave is  doing so, heading for Germany in particular. The number of  mixed-marriage families among the emigres has risen appreciably  as Germans persuade their partners of a different nationality to  try for happiness in the West.    With the adoption of the Constitution on 28 January 1992,  Kazakh was officially declared the state language. Anyone who  wants to remain in state service has to speak Kazakh and such  people are very few and far between among the local Germans and  Russians. The result is that the number of representatives of  the ethnic minorities in leadership structures and the  ministerial apparatus has dropped noticeably in a short period,  representatives of "German Rebirth" say. According to them,  anyone who does not have influential members of their ethnic  minorities in very important positions will find it incredibly  difficult to combat all-powerful officials in the corrupt morass  in which God forbid you utter a "foreign" word.    By the end of 1995 every non-Kazakh will have to say whether  he wants to become a Kazakhstani citizen or not. Anyone who  decides to obtain a Kazakhstani passport must bear in mind that  it will be even harder to leave the country then. Anyone who  takes the reverse decision will find themselves without  citizenship in Kazakhstan after 1995.    In line with legislation, Germany allows a maximum of  230,000  emigres from the former Soviet Union to enter its country each  year. At the same time the federal government is trying to  contain [soderzhat] immigration by providing Kazakhstan with  economic aid. Since 1990, around 80 million German marks have  vanished into Kazakhstan.    The ethnic minorities' only hope is President Nursultan  Nazarbayev, who has officially assured them: "We do not want to  divide our people into them and us." Kazakhstan will hardly be  able to manage without Russian Germans or Russians, otherwise  its development will come to a standstill. The departure of  45,000 Russians in 1992 was a serious blow to Kazakhstan,  particularly if you consider the fact that the bulk of the  Russians were members of the intelligentsia. The Russian  Germans are also very essential. They are diligent artisans and  peasants.    However, aid is going no further than official declarations  since in reality there are hardly any traces of it to be found.  Why for instance is there still no Goethe Institute in Alma-Ata  [Almaty] although the money has long since been provided? And  why, lastly, are representatives of the ethnic minorities  disappearing from important state positions if they are  nonetheless essential, Germans wonder as they pack their bags?</p>

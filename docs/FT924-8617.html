			<p>921110 FT  10 NOV 92 / International Company News: Fokus Bank to seek injection of state cash FOKUS BANK, Norway's third biggest bank, yesterday reported a sharp decline in nine-month net losses to NKr405.3m (Dollars 62.7m) from NKr1.49bn last year, but warned it has been forced to seek a further injection of state capital. Fokus said its capital adequacy at end-September was 4.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets. It needs the extra capital in order to meet a regulation target of 8 per cent by the end of the year. Both Den norske Bank and Christiania Bank, the two biggest banks, last week said they had entered discussions with the state-backed bank insurance fund to obtain fresh capital. Last year the three troubled banks fell under the control of the state after experiencing successive losses for a number of years. As a result the state was forced to inject more than NKr20bn into the Norwegian bank sector.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> T-Bill Rates Drop: The Treasury sold $6.8 billion of new three-month bills at  an average discount rate of 8.41%, down from 8.64% last week. Another $6.8  billion in new six-month bills was sold at an average discount rate of 8.39%,  down from 8.64% last week. The rates were the lowest since Jan. 30, when  three-month bills sold for 8.33% and six-month bills averaged 8.39%. The new  discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 8.71% for  three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,787.40 and 8.88% for a  six-month bill selling for $9,575.80. The discount rate reflects the price  discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face  value.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 21, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> TAX BREAK? Did you buy a home within the last two years? The county assessor  may -- repeat, may -- have good news for you. . . . Assuming the real estate  slump continues through March, when the assessor reappraises property, the  assessed value of your home could fall to match market conditions, a spokesman  says. That would mean a lower tax bill. . . . But if you bought your house  before 1989, forget it. Prop. 13 allows just a 2% assessment increase a year,  so by now those houses are probably listed below market value, the spokesman  says. Rose Ellen O'Connor and Mark I. Pinsky  </P></p>

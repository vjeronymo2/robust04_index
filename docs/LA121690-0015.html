			<p><P> December 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BABY BOOMERS RUNNING IN PLACE  </P> <P> Baby boomers are a large and heterogenous group, and I am tired of the media's  broad portrayals of snot-nosed baby boomers whining over their failed  expectations ("The Dead-End Kids," by Karen Tumulty, Oct. 28).  </P> <P> There are many of us, professional and nonprofessional alike, who do not  subscribe to the narrow vision of success that defines itself by the manic  pursuit of promotions and power.  </P> <P> Those in my peer group are not so lost in fantasy to believe that we can all  make it to the top; we know that a career "plateau" is as inevitable as death  or taxes, and to suggest that many or most members of the baby-boom generation  react to such an event with horror is vexing.  </P> <P> The confrontation of personal limitations and failed expectations, furthermore,  cannot be avoided; it is a rite of passage into maturity and not an experience  invented anew for the baby-boom generation, as the media continues to suggest.  </P> <P> The 1980s hype suggesting that baby boomers believed the world (and our  ambitions) were without limits -- and that we could all succeed and be  fabulously rich -- was an invention of the media.  </P> <P> Most of us never did believe in such a world, and we do not mourn the loss of  such an illusion .  </P> <P> HELGA THORDARSON  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P></p>

Dresher creates experimental operas and  chamber works utilizing electric and acoustical instruments.  </P> <P> Others on the free series, all at the Fine Arts Gallery, will include  internationally known author and raconteur Slonimsky (Jan. 19), and composers  Daniel Lentz (Jan. 25) and John King (Jan. 31), both from Los Angeles.  </P> <P>  -- Among a slew of orchestral events the Orange County Philharmonic Society is  sponsoring at the Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, several stand out:  conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and the National Symphony on Jan. 30; Michael  Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony on March 13; Colin Davis and the Bavarian  Radio Symphony, March 15; Zubin Mehta and the Israel Philharmonic, March 18;  Muti and the Philadelphia Orchestra on May 16 and 18.  </P> <P>  -- Opera buffs can look forward to productions mounted by professional  companies in 1989, and these follow almost back to back at the Performing Arts  Center.  </P> <P> New York City Opera will present Verdi's "Rigoletto" on Jan. 17 and 19 and  Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" on Jan. 18 and 20.  </P> <P> Opera Pacific presents Bellini's "Norma" on Feb. 11 to 24 and Rossini's "Il  Barbiere di Siviglia" on Feb. 17 to 25.  </P> <P> Both companies also fill out their "seasons" with operetta or musical comedy:  City Opera with Lehar's "Merry Widow" on Jan. 21 and 22; Opera Pacific with "My  Fair Lady," June 23 to July 2.  </P> <P>  -- On the lecture circuit, UCI professor Bernard Gilmore will discuss  "Originality and Other Sins," exploring the notion of "originality" as a  criterion for artistic judgment on Jan. 12, the first of two free,  UCI-sponsored faculty lectures in the Stewart Room of the Bren Events Center.  </P> <P> Gilmore is an associate professor in composition, conducting and music theory,  who last year was acting dean of the School of Fine Arts.  </P> <P> The second of the noon-time lectures will be on Jan. 26 when Joseph Huszti will  offer "Seeing With Your Ears and Hearing With Your Eyes: Communication Through  Artistic Performance."

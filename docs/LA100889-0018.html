			<p><P> October 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: EVERYBODY LOVES YOU BY ETHAN MORDDEN (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS:  $8.95)  </P> <P> Ethan Mordden is one of the few authors writing about gay life in America to  reach a general audience. His sure, straightforward prose has such a natural  tone that he seems just to have jotted down the words and misadventures of his  friends. Although "I Read My Nephew Stories" was cited in the 1989 National  Magazine Awards, the strongest stories in this collection are "The Boffer,"  about a man who learns to accept his changed identity when he attends a college  reunion, and "The Dinner Party," in which one of the best and brightest members  of the gay community is forced to confront the terrifying reality of AIDS and  his own mortality. In the final story, the narrator declares that this third  volume concludes his "tales of gay Manhattan" -- a regrettable decision, as  these stories comprise some of the best work of this prolific writer of both  fiction and nonfiction.  </P></p>

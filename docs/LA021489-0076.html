			<p><P> February 14, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 2 ARRESTED IN BEVERLY HILLS 'FOLLOW-HOME' ROBBERY  </P> <P> Police arrested two suspects early Monday in a Beverly Hills "follow-home"  theft, the first arrests in connection with 32 robberies of luxury-car drivers  that have occurred in affluent hillside neighborhoods of the Santa Monica  Mountains.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills robbery was similar to others reported since mid-October,  "but whether it is connected to any of the rest of these robberies, I can't say  at this time ", said Los Angeles Police Detective Patrick Conmay, the head of a  task force investigating the follow-home robberies.  </P> <P> Carluus Daily, 23, and Gina Morena, 20, both of south Los Angeles, were  arrested by Beverly Hills police about midnight near the intersection of Doheny  Drive and Dayton Way.  </P> <P> They were booked on suspicion of robbery and were held at the Los Angeles  County Sheriff's Department substation in West Hollywood. Conmay said police  will attempt to link them to the string of recent robberies in which bandits  have made off with at least $312,000 in cash and jewels.  </P> <P> About half an hour before the arrests Sunday, a 65-year-old man and his  63-year-old wife returning home in a Rolls-Royce were accosted by a man with a  gun in front of their home in the 700 block of Camden Drive. The robber took  about $2,000 in jewelry, police said. No shots were fired and no one was hurt.  </P> <P> Police recovered a handgun when the suspects, who were riding in a yellow  Cadillac, were arrested about 15 blocks away, Conmay said. Investigators not  been able to link the car or the gun to the other robberies, he said.  </P> <P> The robbery was the second follow-home incident of the weekend.  </P> <P> Twenty-two of the robberies have occurred in the San Fernando Valley and 10 in  West Los Angeles and Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> The robbers usually follow the drivers of luxury cars, most frequently  late-model Mercedes-Benzes, to their homes.  </P></p>

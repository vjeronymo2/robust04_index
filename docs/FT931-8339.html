			<p>930219 FT  19 FEB 93 / International Company News: Gehe in move to create Europe's biggest pharmaceutical wholesaler GEHE, a leading German drugs wholesaler, yesterday announced a FFr800 (Dollars 144) per share agreed takeover offer for France's leading wholesaler, Office Commercial Pharmaceutique. The merger would create the largest European pharmaceuticals distribution business, with sales of around DM14bn (Dollars 8.5bn) a year. The two companies already have an alliance with AAH, the UK wholesaler. The deal would ease access to other markets in the European Community and eastern Europe, Gehe said yesterday. The Stuttgart-based German group said it would go ahead with the takeover if it received more than 50 per cent acceptances. It reserved the right to press on with the bid if this level were not reached. After Schering, Gehe is Germany's second-biggest quoted drugs wholesaler, with annual sales of around DM5bn. In 1991, the last full year for which results are available, it made pre-tax profits of DM175m. While wholesaling accounts for around half of group earnings, drugs manufacture provides a further 25 per cent, with the balance coming from various mail order activities. Gehe developed its mail order businesses, specialising in office and warehousing equipment and operating as far afield as the US, during the 1980s. Manufacture, mainly of generic pharmaceutical products has expanded recently. It was boosted after German unification by the acquisition of Jenapharm and a 60 per cent stake in Azupharma. The group faces a squeeze from government plans to reduce health spending. These include price cuts for pharmaceuticals and prescription limits.</p>

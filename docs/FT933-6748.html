			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Keating agrees to talks over tax increases THE Australian government, facing fierce opposition to tax increases announced last week, yesterday agreed to hold negotiations with smaller political parties which have threatened to block the budget in the Senate, the upper house of parliament. The retreat by Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, increased the likelihood of a compromise which would prevent his Labor government from resorting to extreme steps to push through the budget. The row has caused talk of a possible dissolution of both houses of parliament and fresh elections only five months after Mr Keating's Labor government was elected - though the smaller parties in the Senate are thought to have little to gain by forcing elections. Mr Keating yesterday met Ms Cheryl Kernot, leader of the Australian Democrats, who said afterwards that the talks had been constructive. 'I think they know that they have to talk,' she said. The government would have little difficulty securing the budget's passage through the lower house. But in the Senate, 10 senators - Australian Democrats, Greens and an independent - hold the balance of power. The Democrat and Green parties threatened to side with the opposition on the budget. Mr John Dawkins, federal treasurer, said the government did not object to hearing the Democrats' views, but that 'it must be understood that there can be no significant change of the government's overall deficit reduction strategy.' He had announced increases in wholesale taxes and on petrol, alcohol and tobacco in order to battle a widening budget deficit he estimated at ADollars 16bn (Pounds 7bn) for the financial year which began on July 1. According to one opinion poll, the budget caused the government's popularity to drop to its lowest level in Labor's 10 years in power. Mr Bernie Fraser, Reserve Bank governor, warned that the threats to block the budget might force a rise in interest rates - a step the government keenly wants to avoid as it seeks to steer the economy out of a long recession with 10.7 per cent unemployment. The senators' opposition to the new taxes has raised constitutional issues about the role the Senate, which normally passes budgets without question on the principle that the executive should be allowed to govern. Mr Dawkins said earlier in the week: 'I think it would be a very sad day for Australia if we got into the sort of situation that they are in in the US where the executive government is unable to secure the passage of its legislation through the parliament.'</p>

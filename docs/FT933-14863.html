			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / International Company News: 10% of ITV companies held by US institutions US fund managers hold stakes totalling about 10 per cent in the ITV companies, according to a new survey of who owns what in the UK's commercial television sector. The biggest institutional investor is Chase Manhattan with significant stakes in Central, London Weekend Television and Scottish. Fidelity is the second largest US holder in ITV, owning stakes equal to more than 3 per cent of the stand-alone ITV companies. Another leading US investors is Warburg Pincus with an 8.31 per cent stake in LWT. The extent of the US involvement is detailed in Citywatch, a new sharewatch service launched by Investor Communications &amp; Research, part of London-based consultants GAH. The Citywatch survey of institutional ownership in the ITV sector is the latest to be produced by GAH. The consultants have already researched areas such as the food, retailing and stores sectors. Among UK institutional investors, Mercury Asset Management is by far the largest with stakes equalling a total of 8.69 per cent of the stand alone companies. It is strong in the companies which would be the main takeover targets if present rules are relaxed - Central, LWT, Scottish and Anglia. Prudential Portfolio Managers, the sector's second largest investor, is backing a similar range of companies. Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management is also a significant player, but its largest investment is in HTV - a 23.04 per cent stake. The BBC pension fund is also an investor in ITV, holding a 3.83 per cent stake in Anglia Television. Mr James Redhead, of GAH, said he saw the research as 'a key defence tool' for ITV companies trying to ward off unwelcome predators. 'It is also going to be of great value to foreign predators,' he said.</p>

			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report Base metals were under pressure on the LME, with weakness in ZINC and COPPER resulting in most closing lower. Zinc collapsed to 3 1/2 -month lows under intense pressure from technical selling and liquidation, against a background of weak fundamentals. Support for three-month metal at Dollars 1,070 and Dollars 1,060 gave way on the charts, while the market will remain oversupplied despite recent mine and smelter cuts. Copper extended earlier falls, with Comex weak, and as support around Dollars 2,215 for three-month metal gave way the market retreated to end at Dollars 2,198, down Dollars 20. There are significant March put options at Dollars 2,200, so follow-through hedge selling today could push the market down to Dollars 2,180. Follow-through buying powered London's May COCOA contract to close at Pounds 759 a tonne, Pounds 4 above Tuesday's finish after the market regained early losses. Earlier, the market went on the defensive under pressure from jobber long liquidation, but prices began to firm by late morning. Compiled from Reuters</p>

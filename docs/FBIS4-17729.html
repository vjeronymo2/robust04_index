			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Shakhabutdin Zaynutdinov: "Tighter Currency </F> Control in Uzbekistan"]    [Text] Tashkent -- A new statute has come into effect in  Uzbekistan controlling foreign economic transactions by  individuals and corporate bodies.    This has been done, it is believed here, primarily to  strengthen currency circulation in the Republic and increase the  purchasing power of sum coupons during the transition to an  official national currency. It is laid down that quotas for the  export of goods (works, services) cannot be sold, transferred or  reallocated to other corporate bodies.    A ban has been imposed on the settlement of accounts for  foreign economic transactions by Uzbekistan enterprises,  organizations, and institutions with foreign partners, including  CIS countries, through firms' accounts in foreign banks. They  are only allowed to open currency accounts in authorized  Uzbekistan banks if properly registered as participants in  foreign economic activity. Each corporate body is entitled to  open such an account in only one establishment of an authorized  bank; except that, if the bank in question lacks the credit  resources, credit can be obtained by agreement with another bank.    All contracts concluded by enterprises with foreign  partners,  including partners in CIS countries, for the export of licensed  goods, works, and services will be subject to registration at  the local Foreign Economic Relations Ministry. The statute  envisages the obligatory sale of currency earnings (including  CIS countries' currencies) to the Republic Central Bank, with  the simultaneous payment of the equivalent in sum coupons into  the enterprise's clearing account at the current rate.</p>

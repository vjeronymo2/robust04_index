			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Pakistan's textile producers call for halt to cotton exports Pakistan's largest textile manufacturing association, the All Pakistan Textile Manufacturers' Association, is urging an immediately halt to cotton exports as a step to prevent further shortfalls of raw material after this season's crop losses. The association estimates that only 8m bales of cotton will be produced this year, down from an earlier crop target of 12m bales. That level of production would be 1m bales below the local industry's requirement. Mr Tariq Saigol, chairman of APTMA has urged the government to cancel export orders for 500,000 bales of cotton, by either declaring force majeure and fulfilling export commitments out of next year's crop, or by just paying penalties if contracts have to be cancelled. 'It would be strange if we export cotton and then import it for our industrial needs,' he said. Mr Saigol has also urged the government to lower interest rates, which are at present around 22 per cent, as a step towards easing financial pressure on the textile industry. In addition, he demanded a free float of the rupee to bridge a gap of about 5 per cent between official and open market rates as a way to encourage exports. The latest demands from APTMA follow a year-long recession in the local textile industry, where the association claims that manufacturers have been forced to take to out of operation 1.2m spindles out of a total of 6.5m because of continuing losses. According to Mr Saigol, another 500,000 spindles would be at a risk of closure in the coming months unless the government announced new relief measures. Many economists see the textile industry's troubles as a major test for Pakistan's efforts to boost its exports. Almost 58 per cent of the country's export earnings are generated by sales of cotton products. 'Our whole structure of the economy is too heavily dependent on textiles. The textile sector needs to be revamped and revived,' said Mr Saigol.</p>

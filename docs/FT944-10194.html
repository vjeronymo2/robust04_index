			<p>941111 FT  11 NOV 94 / International Company News: Allstate shaken by earthquake - Reducing disaster exposure is a key to earnings Judged by its profits, Allstate has been one of the most volatile of all US insurance companies. Last year, the US's second-biggest car and home insurer made Dollars 1.3bn of profits after tax - equivalent to a 19 per cent return on capital. That is almost unheard of for the US personal property/casualty insurance industry, where premium rates are controlled by state regulators. Then came the earthquake centred in Northridge, California. With its 12-13 per cent of the US car and homeowners' insurance market, Allstate was hit hard by January's earthquake. Like others, the company has revised its estimate of losses upwards several times during the year. The latest figure is Dollars 1.3bn. For Sears, Roebuck which first floated nearly 20 per cent of the company on the stock market in early 1993 and yesterday announced a plan to spin off the remainder, this was nothing new. Two years ago Allstate took a Dollars 2.7bn hit from Hurricane Andrew in Florida, the biggest natural disaster (in insurance terms) to have afflicted the US. All of this makes Allstate, based in Northbrook, Illinois, one of the purest stock market plays in the US personal property/casualty business. State Farm, its bigger rival with about 20 per cent of the US homeowners and car insurance market (and Dollars 1.5bn of losses from Northridge) is a mutually owned company. Farmers, the third-biggest insurer whose concentration on the West Coast landed it with an estimated Dollars 1.3bn of losses from the earthquake, is owned by BAT Industries, the UK-based tobacco and financial services group. Reducing its exposure to natural disasters is one of the keys to future earnings. After taking account of reinsurance cover, Allstate's Northridge losses amount to about 11 per cent of its capital, according to Mr Peter Wade, associate director of Standard &amp; Poor's, the US rating agency. Subjecting the company's balance sheet to various disaster scenarios suggests that about 25-30 per cent of its capital could be at risk, he adds. Allstate is now trying to reduce that to below 20 per cent - although regulations in states such as Florida hinder this process. The scarcity of reinsurance coverage for catastrophe losses has also made the task difficult to accomplish. As long as it is perceived to face higher catastrophe risks than other insurance groups, Allstate is likely to continue to trade on a lower price/earnings multiple (its shares trade on a multiple of about nine times earnings before catastrophe losses, some two points below the average insurance group). 'To some extent, the discount may reflect the controlling interest of Sears,' Mr Myron Piccoult, an insurance analyst at Oppenheimer, suggested recently. However, he added that the catastrophe exposure was the bigger concern. In the short-term, the company's share price is likely to be held back by the release of Sears' 360m shares, many of them into the hands of investors who will no doubt waste no time in selling them on the market. In the meantime, Allstate continues to run one of the most effective sales machines in the US insurance business. Sears was in the financial services business long before it became fashionable - it established the company in 1931 to sell car insurance through its catalogues and stores - and Allstate runs a successful retail network in its own right. The insurance business still bears the hallmarks of its origins, with car policies contributing about two-thirds of premium income from the property/casualty business. (About 15 per cent of the company's total premiums last year came from life insurance.) Unlike its rivals, Allstate operates through a network of agents who sell only Allstate policies. These 15,000 agents, spread across North America, brought in Dollars 20.9bn of premiums last year. The network was built up during the 1980s, a period of rapid expansion when Allstate moved away from its traditional base in Sears' stores. The company has less turnover among its agents than other insurers and more success at selling additional policies to existing customers, of whom it claims 20m. That makes a free-standing Allstate a powerful force - provided it can tame the catastrophe losses, of course.</p>

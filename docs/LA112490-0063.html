			<p><P> November 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BURGER KING AND TV  </P> <P> Howard Rosenberg, wake up to Econ 101! What corporation ignores the needs of  its customers?  </P> <P> By labeling Burger King "a groveler and a coward" is Rosenberg trying to deny  it the freedom to respond to its customers? Am I not entitled to a concerned  reaction when I vote with my dollars?  </P> <P> Since when is a corporation "gutless" just because it doesn't happen to share  Rosenberg's "principles"?  </P> <P> The columnist has a double standard -- maybe in his mind Christians aren't  entitled to the same voice he urges for minorities, gays and women.  </P> <P> ALAN AUFHAMMER  </P> <P> La Canada  </P></p>

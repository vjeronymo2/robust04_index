			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Telegraph deal Shares in the The Telegraph, the London-based daily and Sunday newspaper group, fell sharply to close 17 off at 571p as the Seaq ticker revealed that various blocks of shares, amounting to around 4.3m shares, had been sold into the market at 570p. The shares represented the rump of the big bought deal carried out jointly last week by Cazenove and Goldman Sachs in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger Group reduced its holding in the Telegraph group from 66.2 per cent to 56.95 per cent. Earlier yesterday the Seaq ticker revealed that Hollinger's 12.5m shares had originally been sold to Cazenove/Goldman Sachs at 587p a share. It had previously been believed that Cazenove/Goldmans had placed the majority of the Hollinger shares last Thursday.</p>

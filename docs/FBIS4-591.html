			<p>BFN     [Text] State President F.W. de Klerk has confirmed that his  government is to be a party to the international mediation  process between the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] and the ANC.    Addressing the media after meeting international mediators  Henry Kissinger of the United States and Lord Carrington of  Britain at his official residence in Pretoria last night, Mr. de  Klerk said he was optimistic that another summit meeting of the  key political players could take place by next week, but he said  logistical problems virtually ruled out participation in the  election by the Inkatha Freedom Party. Mr. de Klerk gave his  approval for a document he had been given containing the terms  of reference and time frames thrashed out by the working groups  of the ANC, the IFP and the government. He said it was now up  to the ANC, IFP and kwaZulu government to give their approval.    [Begin de Klerk recording] What now remains -- if I may  focus  on the mediation process -- is finalization of the terms of  reference in the procedures. I have been given a document which  I regard as a relatively good document which is the result of  representatives from the three, four main parties having met  during today. This document is now being put before the  principals from all sides, and if agreement is reached, the  mediation can start almost immediately. I would not rule out  another summit.

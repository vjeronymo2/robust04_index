			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Balladur to unveil jobs package FRENCH Prime Minister Edouard Balladur is to announce a job-creating package to help bring down France's 10.7 per cent unemployment rate, possibly funded out of a special state loan. After talks with employers and unions in recent days, the prime minister has decided to use today's parliamentary debate on the budget to announce the 'acceleration' of measures to boost employment which he had intended to leave until the autumn. According to La Tribune newspaper, the measures could include an extra FFr2bn (Pounds 230m) to keep young people in work experience schemes, in addition to the FFr7bn payroll tax cuts in the May 10 budget, and accelerated spending of the extra FFr1.3bn already pledged for public works. Mr Philippe Auberger, the parliament's budget rapporteur, welcomed reports that the government might fund any extra job-creating initiatives out of a special state loan. The government could thereby take advantage of the fall in the cost of money - which continued its decline yesterday when the Bank of France cut its intervention rate from 7.75 per cent to 7.5 per cent and the 5-to-10-day lending facility from 8.75 per cent to 8.5 per cent. Mr Auberger said investors might hurry to subscribe to a new loan before rates fall any further. Economists are now waiting to see whether the commercial banks will follow the Bank of France's lead by cutting base rates as they did two weeks ago - with a reduction from 9.25 per cent to 9 per cent - following the last cut in official interest rates. Yesterday's reduction means that the cost of France's official short-term facility has fallen from 12 per cent to 8.5 per cent under the new government. So far lower interest rates have had little impact on the French economy, which is plagued by sluggish consumer spending and industrial investment. Norway's central bank yesterday announced a cut in the key overnight lending rate to 7.50 per cent from 7.75. It was the 12th rate cut so far this year, with rates starting 1993 at 11 per cent. The bank said the move was part of the downward trend in European interest rates.</p>

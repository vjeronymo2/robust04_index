			<p>Language: <F P=105>Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Eli Nisan at </F> the Knesset on 8 March -- recorded in Hebrew with Arabic  subtitles; translated from the Hebrew]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Nisan] How will yesterday's  terror attack against the SLA [South Lebanese Army] soldiers  affect the status of the SLA and the security zone?    [Rabin] We have no intention of letting these incidents go  unnoticed. We will take steps when we see fit in order to  prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Those who perpetrated  the attacks will be punished.    [Nisan] Are you now sending signals to those who perpetrated  the attacks?    [Rabin] I am not sending any signals. We are in a state of  war and not a dialogue with Hizballah and the Palestinian  rejectionist terror organizations. On the other hand, there is  no doubt that the Lebanese and Syrian Governments must do their  share in calming the situation if they ever wish to promote the  peace process.</p>

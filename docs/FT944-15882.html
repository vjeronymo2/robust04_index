			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / World News in Brief: Currency factors trip up the stock market Currency factors tripped up a UK stock market which had taken in its stride the widely heralded US data on consumer prices, retail sales and industrial production. Wall Street made little response to the economic statistics which were seen as largely neutral and likely to reduce the chances of an early tightening in Federal Reserve policy. At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 35.2 points down at 3,106.7, having barely held above 3,104 earlier. The final total of 575.2m shares through the Seaq electronic network compared with 816.9m in the previous session. London stocks, Page 15; World stock markets, Page 22; Markets, Weekend II.</p>

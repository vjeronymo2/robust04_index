			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSMAKERS: AFTER OLE MISS, A NEW CHALLENGE  </P> <P> James H. Meredith, the first black person to enroll at the University of  Mississippi 27 years ago, has been hired by conservative Sen. Jesse Helms  (R-N.C.), who has opposed civil rights bills and other domestic programs  favored by many blacks. Meredith, 56, has changed his views markedly over the  years. Integration is the "biggest con job ever pulled on anybody," he has  said. "My understanding of the senator's position . . . is that every citizen  has the entitlement to every right. So there's no need for any specific rights.  And I agree with that." Meredith said that he had been hired to advise the  senator on questions of race, education, drugs and urban problems, after  providing informal advice for the last year.  </P> <P>  -- Ernest Hemingway had a reputation for playing hard. Apparently, he worked  hard too. Hemingway labored for six months over the final chapter to his second  novel, "A Farewell to Arms," writing scores of different endings before  settling on the version that appeared in print. "There's this image of  Hemingway as a raucous, drinking guy and not a guy sitting so carefully at his  desk and slaving over the ending. Most people would instead picture Hemingway  dashing the ending off and going out to catch a marlin," said Lisa Middents,  assistant to the curator of the Hemingway Collection at the John F. Kennedy  Library in Boston. An exhibit of some of the 44 pages of draft endings, mostly  handwritten, goes on display today at the Hemingway Collection. The exhibit  commemorates the 60th anniversary of the novel's Sept. 27, 1929, publication by  Charles Scribner's Sons. The novel, set in Italy and Switzerland during World  War I, chronicles the romance between a young American ambulance driver and an  English nurse at an American Red Cross Hospital in Milan.  </P> <P>  -- Sen. Albert Gore Jr. (D-Tenn.) took exception with U.S. News &amp; World  Report's depiction of Tennessee as a backward state. In last week's issue of  the magazine, there was a listing of what various jobs pay around the country,  but the map of Tennessee was upside down and backward. In a humorous protest  letter to U.S. News Editor-in-Chief Mort Zuckerman, Gore said that though no  one might notice if one flipped Wyoming or Colorado, that is not so when  Tennessee is turned inside out. "I hope the magazine didn't mean to move  Memphis," Gore wrote. "As you know, every Federal Express package in the  country must first pass through Memphis. Put the city in the wrong place and  the entire U.S. economy would fall apart. . . . " SHIRLEY MARLOW  </P></p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Military leads modernisation march: People's Army is helping quasi-capitalist development THE first exhibit you see on entering the Museum of the People's Liberation Army is not a tank or missile, but four luxury cars. Two of them - one of indeterminate manufacture and one Russian - were used by Chairman Mao Zedong; another, a Skoda, was used by Zhu De, one of China's great generals of the revolutionary civil war that brought the Communists to power in 1949. But the one that people queue up to be photographed next to is the open-roofed and Shanghai-produced Hungqi, or Red Flag, used by Deng Xiaoping in 1985 when he rode triumphant through Tiananmen Square. The use of cars may be odd but, along with the 20-foot statue of Mao in the foyer and giant portraits of Engels, Marx, Lenin and Stalin, they have a powerful symbolic importance. They underline to visitors the central fact that the military in China is inseparable from the Communist party. Indeed, the primary duty of the 3.2m-member People's Liberation Army (PLA) is to defend the Communist party, a 'duty' it performed in June 1989 when its tanks and infantry suppressed pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, in the process killing hundreds and possibly thousands of young people. Defence of territorial China comes second and is followed by a number of other directives. The one of most practical importance is to assist in the development of China through construction and production works. It was the PLA which 12 years ago laid down the infrastructure for Shenzhen  -China's most thriving 'special economic zone' on the border with Hong Kong. In 1991, according to Chinese press reports, the PLA spent more than 25m work days working on 140 key projects in provincial China. Modernisation of the PLA has been the prime aim of China's leadership since Deng in the mid-1970s accused the army of being bloated, lax, conceited, extravagant and inert. And, as the party is inseparable from the PLA, so too is the PLA's modernisation inseparable from the party's policy for the quasi-capitalist development of the country. 'The faster China develops its economy, carries out reform and opens its door to the rest of the world, the more necessary it is to strengthen national defence,' according to Chi Haotian, PLA chief of staff. This view was developed in the same newspaper by General Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission and the man likely to be appointed to the highest level of the party, its politburo. 'The modernisation of the military can be seen as a question of life and death,' the People's Liberation Army Daily quoted him as saying. 'Military modernisation does not just mean modernisation of weaponry, but without that nothing else is possible.' Gen Liu - a close associate of Deng since the 1940s - has spent much of his career with the Chinese navy, developing it from a force which provided coastal defence to one with something near long-distance capability. Western military analysts say there are still weaknesses in its ability to project Chinese power in the region - air support is poor, as is the navy's ability to defend itself from air attack - but they respect the intelligence with which the modernisation of the navy has progressed. Weaknesses or not, the growth of the navy - which consists of 92 tactical submarines, one nuclear submarine, 19 destroyers and 37 frigates - has worried China's neighbours. Its interest in buying a Russian aircraft carrier from Ukraine (now on hold, western analysts believe) has alarmed Japan and caused concern in the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia, which all, along with China, lay claim to the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea. Gen Liu is expected to use the same energy he devoted to the navy in modernising the army and the air force; the latter uses dated technology, although military analysts say it has upgraded air defence capability with the acquisition of at least 24 SU-27 'Flanker' combat aircraft from Russia. The army is still over-manned and poorly equipped, trained and led. It is essentially a peasant army and represents the greatest challenged to China's military planners. But the road to modernisation is long. To upgrade quickly China would have to import western armaments, laying it open to dependence on ideological foes and incurring huge costs which it is unable to bear. China's military leaders appear to have decided instead on having a smaller standing army that is better educated, trained and led. Modernising equipment will come from selective foreign purchases, which will then be analysed in China and, if possible, copied. Gen Liu is at 76 not a young man; it is anyone's guess how long he will have to oversee the modernisation effort. However, if he succeeds, he may find that his staff car will join those of Mao, Zhu and Deng in the PLA museum.</p>

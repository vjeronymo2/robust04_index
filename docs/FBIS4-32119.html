			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Georgi Barbarovski: "Dangerous Serbian </F> Threats"]    [Text] The Serbian Army is endangering the territorial  integrity of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. Some 15 soldiers went  approximately 250 meters inside our country's territory and  seized heights and the most significant strategic points on  Cupino Brdo and Podrzikonj near Kriva Palanka. The soldiers of  our northern neighbor now control the highest peak on Mount  Straza. The information from the field is that for the whole  past month there have been some major movements on the Serbian  side, that tents have been put up and trenches dug on Macedonian  territory. In the absence of official information from the  Defense Ministry, the local inhabitants are gripped by fear and  anxiety, even though so far no incidents have occurred apart  from the seizure of our territory. The Macedonian Army soldiers'  task is just to observe the Serbian military "breach."    This is not the first time that regular units of the Serbian  Army have violated the territorial integrity of our country.  There has been a series of incidents in the last three to four  months, which announced what is now actually happening. The  border with Yugoslavia has some disputed zones that have been  avoided by the Macedonian side and UNPROFOR [UN Protection  Forces]. These zones were not defined by the border  commissions, and now more relaxed times and a calmer atmosphere  are expected in order to resolve them. The Serbian side knows  this, too. However, it is keeping up the tension by making open  threats to peace and security. Serbia has not stopped  demonstrating its force on Macedonia's northern border. It does  that when its warplanes fly over our territory, when its  disguised soldiers capture our border troops, and when they do  not allow UNPROFOR units to use the roads along the Macedonian  border zone.    It would be naive to believe that this latest serious  incident is not part of a strategy that is breaking through on  several fronts. The entry of the Serbian soldiers onto our  territory just before the beginning of the census coincides with  the open threats by the political associations of the Serbs in  Macedonia to boycott the census because of their "not regulated  citizenship status" and because allegedly "85 percent of the  Serbian population" has not been provided with citizenship  documents from the Interior Ministry. At the same time there are  claims that "surnames are being changed, particularly of Serbs  who have lived in Macedonia for a long time."    On the other hand, the Serbian Orthodox Church and its  "administrators for Macedonia" "recommend" that the Macedonian  Orthodox Church ultimately return to its "canonic mother,"  reinforcing its threats with border provocations.    All this, supported by part of the Serbian state press,  which  uses the strongest symbols, archaic pictures, and mythological  formulas ("Serbian country," "autochthonous people," "old  homes," "graves of Serbian soldiers") is aimed not only at  providing an excuse for the "warmongers" but also at creating a  psychosis in Serbia about danger, which is the only possible way  to maintain the ruling oligarchy. That is why the comments of  the military leadership of Serbia on the incident near Kriva  Palanka was so dismissive: "It is something that Macedonian  journalists have made up." Just as the Bosnian model was also a  "journalist's invention": provocation -- incident -- military  conflict.    Facing this great Serbian military pressure it is strange  that the Macedonian Government, the Defense Ministry, and the  General Staff of the Macedonian Army are taking such an  attitude. It is true that the minister responsible and chief of  the military leadership are outside the country, but the public  cannot be left without relevant information in such cases. We  do not know if the international bodies have been informed about  the incident, which could exert pressure on the Serbian state  leadership to withdraw their soldiers from Macedonian territory.  The issue of the disputed border regions should be resolved as  soon as possible, but only through negotiations. No other  argument can fill in the "geographical holes." Unless the  Bosnian war mania has come down to the south.</p>

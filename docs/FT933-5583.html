			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Charges deepen Osprey losses AFTER CHARGING a Pounds 3.49m loss on discontinued operations Osprey Communications incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 4.25m in the 12 months ended May 31. The period is part of the new accounting year, which now ends on September 30. In the comparative period the loss was Pounds 336,000 after exceptionals of Pounds 355,000. During the period the group, which provides advertising and associated services, sold the marketing services division to management for Pounds 2.1m, bought SMS Communications for Pounds 1.63m in cash and shares, and raised Pounds 1.3m net via a rights issue. On completion of those transactions Mr John French resigned as chairman and chief executive and was succeeded by Mr Jack Rubins. The new chairman said yesterday that negotiations were in hand for the disposal of Rayner Holdings and Acute-Marketing and Communications, two of the small regional subsidiaries, to their managements. Provision had been made for the release of goodwill in the accounts. Mr Rubins said despite the greater than expected trading loss - Pounds 384,000 from turnover of Pounds 21.9m - the balance sheet had been substantially enhanced by the disposals and rights issue. At May 31 a pro forma statement showed net assets of Pounds 636,000 - in the balance sheet there were negative assets of Pounds 950,000. The group was profitable in June and July, with the performance of SMS being 'particularly encouraging'. Mr Rubins said the group was beginning to make progress. Losses per share were 28.6p (2.03p) of which exceptionals accounted for 24.95p. To preserve trustee status an interim dividend of 0.1p is declared.</p>

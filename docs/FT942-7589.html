			<p>940525 FT  25 MAY 94 / Water worries hit Tory hopes Conservative candidates in south-west England are putting pressure on the government over the area's high water charges, which they fear could cost them seats in next month's European elections. Water charges in Devon and Cornwall are 50 per cent above the national average, and Liberal Democrats, who expect to do well in the area, are campaigning strongly on the issue. Mr Christopher Beazley, Tory MEP for Cornwall and West Plymouth, has asked Mr John Major, the prime minister, to introduce a national levy on water charges to pay for anti-pollution measures. Mr Beazley has also held discussions with Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Cornwall Conservatives also suggest that polluting companies could be required to pay surcharges for funding coastal clean-up operations. South West Water, which covers Devon and Cornwall, is involved in a Pounds 2bn clean-up operation, to meet European environmental directives. Water charges in the south-west have aroused fierce opposition, and rose by 12.5 per cent this year. Liberal Democrats describe the issue as 'the south-west's poll tax', arguing that 3 per cent of the UK population is being asked to pay for cleaning 30 per cent of the coastline. Party activists last year collected 30,000 signatures for a petition against the charges. Mr Robin Teverson, Liberal Democrat candidate for Cornwall, said: 'Privatisation has forced water bills through the roof, whilst South West Water continue to make big profits.' Mr Major, who opened the Conservatives' national campaign at a meeting with activists in south-east Cornwall on Monday, refused to be drawn by journalists on the issue. He said: 'There's a problem with water. We are looking at it, but I can't give you a promise today.' He added that water prices had fallen in real terms since privatisation, and that several other products did not have a uniform price across the country. Mr Beazley said water was not merely a 'regional resource', and the area's tourism industry, used by people from the rest of the UK, was dependent on an effective coastal clean-up. 'We need some form of national levy to help pay for this programme,' he said, adding that the government 'still had some work to do' before it decided how best to pay for the clean-up operation.</p>

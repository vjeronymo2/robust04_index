			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: RADIO  </P> <P> The sale of classical music station KFAC (1330) to a broadcast company that  plans to switch to Asian-language programming looked like the end of Beethoven  &amp; Co. on the AM dial. But now comes Saul Levine, owner of all-jazz KKGO-FM  (105.1), to the rescue. Beginning in May, Levine's AM station, all-news KSHO  (540), will switch its call letters to KKGO-AM at the same time that it goes to  an all-classical format. That wouldn't have meant much to Los Angeles, given  the station's relatively weak 1,000 watts of output. But the Federal  Communications Commission has given Levine the go-ahead to boost power to  25,000 watts. As a result, all-classical KKGO-AM should be capable of reaching  as many as 10 million listeners in Orange and Los Angeles counties, living up  to its new slogan: "Your concert hall on the air."

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 30 (XINHUA) -- South Korea Monday [30  May] hailed the United States' decision to renew  most-favored-nation (MFN) status for China as a positive  influence on Asia-Pacific trade.    "The Government of the Republic of Korea welcomes the U.S.  decision to extend China's MFN status as a very practical  action," a Foreign Ministry official said here.    The decision will enhance trade activities in the  Asia-Pacific region and positively influence the launching of  the World Trade Organization (WTO), the official said.    On May 26, U.S. President Bill Clinton renewed MFN status  for  China, declaring there will be no link between future MFN  renewals and human rights.</p>

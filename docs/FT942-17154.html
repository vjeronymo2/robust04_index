			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / International Capital Markets: UK falls to foot of fixed-income table The UK was the worst performer of the world's leading fixed-income markets during the first quarter of this year, weighed down by fears of rising inflation and diminishing prospects for an early cut in base rates. According to data supplied by J. P. Morgan Securities, UK government bonds (gilts) showed a negative return of 6.68 per cent in local currency terms from January to March, far outpacing a loss of 2.74 per cent in the European index and a loss of 2.86 per cent in the global index. Last month alone, gilts fell by 3.2 per cent, the second-worst performance after Canadian government bonds which lost 4.65 per cent. Most government bond markets fell for the second month in March as a result of the rise in US interest rates and the liquidation of long positions by highly-leveraged international investors. Politics helped to push the Italian government bond market to the top of the local currency performance tables with a return of 1.52 per cent in March and a negative return of just 0.12 per cent over the first quarter. The election victory of Mr Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing alliance bolstered both the lira and the local bond market.</p>

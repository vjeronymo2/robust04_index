			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sun Shangwu: "Private and Collective Tech Firms Expand </F> Role"]    [Text] The non-State high-tech firms in China have vowed  to play a greater role in the country's modernization drive and  the development of its market-oriented economy.    The pledge follows the central government's call to  encourage  all economic sectors to contribute more to China's development,  while letting the public sector play a leading role.    Private and collectively-run science and technology firms  have flourished as the country is switching from a planned  economy to market-oriented reforms.    "They can respond quickly and flexibly to the market needs,  said Wang Zhigruo, Executive Secretary General of the China  Association for Science and Technology.    The wider the market opens, the more these firms can  contribute to technological development "because they are  intrinsically market-oriented," Wang pointed out yesterday at an  ongoing three-day meeting sponsored by the China Non-State  Science and Technology Entrepreneurs Association.    These enterprises aim to introduce their research products  to  the market "as soon as possible," he added.    The practice of combining capital, talent, resources,  equipment and technology in the non-State science firms is  setting an example for science and technological development  throughout the country, according to Wang.    These private and collectively-run enterprises are expected  to attract more foreign capital and technology in the future,  which will speed their technical progress and help them occupy  the international market.    Most of the capital will support scientific research and the  development of new products, the meeting was told.    The Stone Group, a well-known collectively-owned computer  firm in Beijing, last year listed its shares in the Hong Kong  stock market.    "This will not only help them accumulate development funds  but will also help transform their business management," Wang  told the meeting.    Another prominent non-State science firm, the Beida Fang  Zheng Group, a leader in digital Chinese word-processing and  typesetting systems, has seen its products widely accepted by  Chinese publishers worldwide.    There are now 45,000 private and collectively-run science  enterprises in China, employing a workforce of 1.2 million, Wang  said.    The industrial and trade volume of these enterprises last  year topped 50 billion yuan ($5.7 billion). More than 100 of  the firms own assets valued at more than 100 million yuan ($11.5  million) each.    Most of these enterprises deal with technology-intensive  industries including chemicals, telecommunication, computers,  building materials, medicine and environmental protection  technology.</p>

			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Miras cuts signal gradual phasing out - Banks and building societies The biggest impact on retail financial services companies in the Budget emerged in measures further to reduce mortgage interest tax relief, and to introduce a new fixed-rate national savings bond for pensioners. Banks' distant fear that the government might impose a form of 'windfall' tax on their recovering profits proved unfounded. This meant that they were most affected in their expanding role as mortgage lenders. Building societies said the restriction of mortgage interest relief to 15 per cent from April 1995 - following the cut to 20 per cent from next April announced in the March Budget - was a further signal that the relief would eventually be phased out. However, most lenders said the measure did not disrupt the faltering recovery in the housing market as much as some had feared. They also welcomed the fact that a gradual phase-out would avoid sharp movements in the market, such as the surges in demand that have taken place in the past. The introduction in the new year of the new National Savings Pensioners Guaranteed Income Bond giving pensioners a fixed monthly income for five years could signal further pressure on societies' retail funding, which is already stretched. However, Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, and one of the strongest past critics of National Savings products, said that he believed societies would be able to compete with the bond. National Savings said that the bond would be introduced in line with 'market rates prevailing at the time of the launch' in the New Year. Mr Longhurst said that as long as this was true, the market for retail funds would not be distorted. 'If they are talking about it being at the market rate, I would ask if it will be a good deal for pensioners to fix their savings rate for the next five years when most people believe rates are at a low point,' he said. Mr Brian Davis, operations director of Nationwide Building Society, said it would be 'churlish' to criticise the Budget too strongly when Mr Clarke had not introduced measures that would disrupt the short-term housing market recovery. He said that the measures to restrict mortgage interest relief had been postponed by a year, which would allow borrowers to adjust gradually. Societies also welcomed the fact that social security payments were not altered. Lloyds Bank said that it now seemed that mortgage interest relief would be phased out in the long term. The government was right, it said, to implement this in stages rather than distorting the market by setting a single date.</p>

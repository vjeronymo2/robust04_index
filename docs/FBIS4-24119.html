			<p>BFN     [Text] On 21 June [words indistinct] 3d regiment, besieged  in Bocoio District, through a military convoy made up of 17  vehicles. This attempt failed, however, because the glorious  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] annihilated the  convoy [words indistinct] in Benguela Province. Our  correspondent Rogerio Chisolo has more details.    The convoy [words indistinct] in Bocoio District, was  escorted by three battalions made up of the Angolan Armed  Forces, the People's Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FAPLA], and the emergency police. The convoy could not  withstand the momentum of our glorious forces, which in 45  minutes of clashes put the enemy troops to flight, leaving  behind more than 25 of their comrades dead and many more  captured. Our forces also destroyed all the vehicles and a  large quantity of war materiel. The residents in the area have  been capturing and handing over to our positions FAPLA soldiers,  who in their shameful flight try to reach safer places.</p>

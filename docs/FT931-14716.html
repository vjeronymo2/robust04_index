			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / International Company News: Westinghouse Electric and GE Capital talks fail WESTINGHOUSE Electric and GE Capital have terminated talks which might have led to GE Capital buying some or all of the loan portfolio of Westinghouse's troubled financial services unit. Westinghouse's shares fell on the news to close at Dollars 13 3/4 , down Dollars 1, last night. Wall Street had regarded a sale to GE as a quick and tidy way for Westinghouse to shed the problem. GE declined to comment further but Westinghouse said in a statement that its finan-cial adviser, Morgan Stanley, believed that 'substantially more value should be realised by a programme of individual and small pool sales than the sale to GE Capital would have created'. Westinghouse, which has been plagued by property loan problems for two years, decided last November to get out of financial services, though it said then it could take three years to sell off its assets. Westinghouse said yesterday it was confident that it would achieve the liquidations and values contained in November's plan and added that numerous parties had expressed an interest in the financial services business. This is the second time talks between the two companies have come to nothing. In December 1991, GE cast an eye over the credit unit's assets, but it was apparently interested in buying only a few of them.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ives Marie Chanel: "The Farmers Are Turning Into </F> `Gas' Vendors"]    [Text] We are in Anse-a-Pitres, located some 90 km from the  southernmost end of the Haitian-Dominican border. To get there,  one has to cross Haiti's highest mountain range on trails not  fit for motor vehicles, often less than 3 meters wide and  occasionally at an altitude of 2,000 meters.    After crossing what is left of the Pine Forest and the  Thiotte area, considered the country's leading coffee-producing  region, one sees nothing but desolation. The spectacle that  greets one's eyes is that of a semidesert region whose people  are wallowing in poverty. Since the UN Security Council  reimposed the sanctions in November, smuggling and prostitution  have gained ground.    Agriculture, once the peasants' principal or even sole  source  of income, is quickly being replaced by oil products. On a strip  of over 30 km, today's peasants are more concerned about buying  and reselling "black gold" than they are with working the  fields. Furthermore, some of them say quite openly that the dam  on the Pedernales that serves Anse-a-Pitres and the Dominican  region of the Pedernales is underutilized on the Haitian side.    With no management whatsoever, water from the irrigation  system built over a decade ago by Presidents Duvalier and Blanco  is unequally distributed and a bag of fertilizer selling for 200  gourdes is out of reach of small farmers. One is forced to  conclude that farming in the region today is a rich man's trade.    Robert, a 37-year-old farmer lucky enough to attend school  for four years of his life, attributes this situation to the  poor crop harvested this year and a tight economic situation  that has resulted in an excessive rise in the cost of basic  products.    The fuel trade has replaced coffee, for which the last  spectacular boom in world prices was around 1975. Every day,  peasants from Bannann, Savane Longue, and Anse-a-Pitres  transport thousands of liters of fuel from the various supply  points in the border area by donkey or on their own backs and  haul it to users in the southeastern and western regions of the  country, particularly Jacmel and Port-au-Prince.    Haitian merchants in Bannann, Boni, and Savane Longue are  served by Dominican traffickers. Haitians cross the border with  no problem and get their supply from Kiki, Carlo, or Selom, all  Dominicans who in recent years have officially set themselves up  as livestock breeders in this very isolated mountainous region.    According to the Haitian peasants, however, the truth is a  different matter. In actual fact, these Dominican "livestock  breeders" are nothing but traffickers who have been smuggling  sugar over the border since about 1985. As in the case of the  Haitians from Bannann, fuel has now taken the place of sugar for  these Dominican "business tycoons" from the "Banano" region.  Kiki, Selom, and Carlo require advance payment from the Hatians  on fuel purchases, yet they have not yet delivered fuel paid for  in January.    In Anse-a-Pitres, smuggling and the "fuel market" have  expanded considerably. An average of 5,000 gallons of gasoline  and diesel fuel cross the border daily, although this commune of  over 13,000 inhabitants does not even have three vehicles! There  are depots all over the place, a disaster waiting to happen. Oil  products are stored in summary dwellings usually built of wood.  Already in early March, two homes were ravaged by a fire caused  by improper fuel handling. In the daytime, Haitians and  Dominicans transport a limited number of fuel containers by  sailboat or on foot.    It is said that surveillance is strict, but by nightfall  Dominican soldiers close their eyes and allow products to get  through in exchange for a cut of 3 pesos (3.6 gourds) a gallon.  Deals are made "in the field" in Haitian territory. At this spot  located less than 2 km from the border, Haitian buyers, looking  for all the world like lovers on their way to moonlit evening  trysts, stand by their containers waiting for Dominican vendors!  All night long, dozens of Dominican traffickers from Pedernales  come on foot to unload their supply. At the same time, Haitian  sailboats transfer their fuel from Dominican boats anchored in  the open sea.    In Anse-a-Pitres, business is done in pesos. In recent  weeks,  Dominican currency has clearly risen in value compared with the  Haitian gourde. The rate of exchange has stabilized at 23-24  percent, but the money changers up their rates when they see  trucks or boats from the capital or chief regional towns. Local  suppliers of oil products react similarly upon seeing these  new-type visitors.    The Dominican traffickers have also learned to calculate,  which they demonstrated clearly by deciding on 19 March to stage  a strike. Saturday evening, the Haitians futilely protested the  unilateral decision, and the pitch was raised a tone by the  leaders of the movement and a handful of traffickers who managed  to get through the line to market their products despite the  strikers' ban.    Armed with sticks and machetes, the Dominican leaders forced  the latter to retreat or sell their products at the price set  for a Haitian buyer who had deserted his camp. According to one  Dominican leader on hand this Saturday evening, the purpose of  the movement was to raise the selling price of oil products.    The Dominicans claim that a gallon of gasoline going for 35  pesos (42 gourdes) just before the protest movement should cost  45 or 50 (54 or 60 gourdes), while diesel fuel should be sold  for between 35 and 40 pesos.    Dominican smugglers justify their demands by the fact that  their profit margin on a gallon of fuel is insignificant because  of deductions made by truckers and Dominican soldiers who are  among the prime middlemen and/or beneficiaries of the market.  Because of the official ban placed on the sale of oil products  in containers by the Balaguer Government, small-time Dominican  traffickers are forced to pay truckers 27 pesos for a gallon of  gasoline that costs 20 at the pump, they say.    The movement, initiated by the Dominicans, seemed to be  succeeding by Sunday morning and had a significant impact on the  prices paid for oil products in Anse-a-Pitres, considered the  main supplier for southeastern Haiti. Boats from Jacmel and  Marigot spent hours waiting on Sunday before giving up at noon  without ever getting their supply. And yet, they have little  choice since waiting is profitable. Once the pie has been split  between border runners, soldiers (100 gourdes/drum as the fee  between boats), haulers (100 gourdes from Pedernales to  Anse-a-Pitres and 520/drum to the capital), the merchants still  make a 100-percent profit!    "We have lost everything. The crop was bad and `gas' is our  only sure source of income. But after the embargo is lifted, the  people who do not own land or livestock will definitely have no  way to make it," said the farmer who acted as our guide. When  asked about a possible date on which the embargo would be  lifted, Boyer, a young farmer called intelligent by travelers  from Port-au-Prince, left it up to God: "God only knows (...);  the people say it will be in two years," he said mischievously.</p>

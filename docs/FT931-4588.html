			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: De Beers restricts dividend cut to 29% DE BEERS, the South African company which dominates the world diamond market, yesterday pleased investors by holding the cut in its 1992 dividend to 29 per cent - to 79.1 cents from 112.1 cents - after announcing a 35 per cent fall in earnings for the year. Many analysts had predicted a much larger reduction in the payout. The company's shares climbed after the announcement, closing at R68.85 (Dollars 21.61) - nearly 4 per cent up for the day. Analysts agreed the size of the dividend cut indicated that De Beers' financial health and the general state of the world diamond industry were better than the market had expected. Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said the fall in earnings reflected the difficult second half. Attributable profits at De Beers and Centenary, its offshore arm, fell by 49 per cent in the second half, compared with a 26 per cent fall in first. Pre-tax profits on the diamond account fell by 20 per cent to Dollars 644m from Dollars 801m in 1991 reflecting the impact of the quotas. Net interest income slumped 79 per cent to Dollars 30m from Dollars 141m. This was due to lower cash balances after the company bought up diamond supplies that bypassed the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the De Beers company that trades 80 per cent of world rough diamond output. Mr Ogilvie Thompson estimated that Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m worth of diamonds which bypassed the CSO - both legal and illegal - had come from Angola during the year, of which De Beers had bought about two-thirds. Attributable earnings fell to Dollars 491m from Dollars 759m, while equity accounted earnings fell to Dollars 757m from Dollars 1.07bn. Earnings per share, excluding retained earnings of associates, fell 35 per cent to 129 cents from 200 cents. Cautious view of diamond market, Page 36</p>

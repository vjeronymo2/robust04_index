			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EX-ILLINOIS GOVERNOR FREED AFTER 18 MONTHS OF 7-YEAR FRAUD TERM  </P> <P> Former Gov. Daniel Walker, who pleaded guilty to taking $1.45 million in  fraudulent loans, was free today on a federal judge's order reducing his  sentence to the nearly 18 months he served in a federal prison.  </P> <P> Walker, 66, whose fraudulent deals included one with his own savings and loan  association, was freed Wednesday from the federal prison camp in Duluth, Minn.,  hours after his lawyer filed a motion seeking early release.  </P> <P> Walker, a Democrat, had served nearly 18 months after pleading guilty to fraud  charges on Oct. 9, 1987. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for bank  fraud, perjury and misapplication of funds.  </P> <P> Walker was a longtime adversary of the late Mayor Richard J. Daley and first  attracted national attention when he compiled a report on the violence at the  1968 Democratic National Convention, infuriating Daley by calling the clash a  "police riot."  </P></p>

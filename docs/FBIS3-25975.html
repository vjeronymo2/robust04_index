Setting up "Radio Free Asia" is a mistake by the United  States, a Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying in  all daily newspapers.    The U.S. Senate last week debated legislation on the  creation  of a the radio station, which President Bill Clinton proposed in  June, that would broadcast to Myanmar [Burma], China, Laos,  Vietnam, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).    The Vietnamese spokesman said, "the people of Asia believe  the aim (of the radio station) is to impose foreign political  points of view on them. It represents clear interference in  their internal affairs as it aims to provoke instability in  these countries."    The plan would not only be harmful to economic and social  development in Asian countries but also would affect relations  between these countries and the United States, he added.    "NHAN DAN" (the PEOPLE'S DAILY) said in an article today  that  the U.S. Senate's decision was completely counter to the trend  of peace, stability, and cooperation in Asia and in the world.  It also violates international law, the paper pointed out.    "QUAN DOI NHAN DAN" (the PEOPLE'S ARMY newspaper) said in a  Sunday article that the U.S. decision was a product of the Cold  War period and went against the general trend in the Asian  region.    The army newspaper said U.S. President Bill Clinton and many  other U.S. senior officials have stated that they respect the  sovereignty and the right to self-determination of other  countries, and would not intervene in the internal affairs of  other countries. The paper said it was a pity that U.S.  authorities have now gone back on their word and violated  international law.    The article expressed the hope that the United States would  make a correct decision in accord with the general trend in Asia  and the world.</p>

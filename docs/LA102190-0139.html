			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CROSS-COUNTRY;  </P> <P> AGOURA'S DROSSIN TIES COURSE MARK  </P> <P> Deena Drossin of Agoura High tied a course record in winning the girls' team  sweepstakes race at the Mt. San Antonio College Cross-Country Invitational in  Walnut.  </P> <P> Drossin, a senior, finished the three-mile course in 17 minutes 16 seconds,  equaling the girls' course record set by Kirsten O'Hara of Palos Verdes in  1983. Veronica Barajas of Channel Islands was second in 18:02.  </P> <P> Agoura won the girls' team sweepstakes with 61 points. San Diego Mt. Carmel  finished second with 91 points.  </P> <P> Louie Quintana of Arroyo Grande, one of the nation's top high school  cross-country runners, won the boys' team sweepstakes race in a personal best  at Mt. SAC of 14:40, making him the fifth-fastest runner ever at Mt. SAC. David  Hartmann of Canyon Country Canyon finished second in 14:51.  </P> <P> Madera of the Central Section won the boys' team sweepstakes with 96 points and  Newhall Hart was second with 161. Arroyo Grande finished fifth with 192.  </P> <P> The Mt. SAC Invitational is the largest cross-country meet in the West, with  more than 300 high schools and 7,000 runners competing Saturday.  </P> <P> Neither Drossin nor Quintana has been defeated this season. Drossin, 17, is the  defending state Division I and Southern Section Division 2-A champion.  Quintana, 17, finished second at both the state Division I and Southern Section  2-A finals last year.  </P> <P> Drossin has run the hilly Mt. SAC course many times during her high school  career, but her time Saturday was 18 seconds better than her previous personal  best. She led from start to finish, widening her lead over Barajas by 30  seconds during the second mile of the race.  </P> <P> After the race, Drossin was told she had been timed in 17:18. She said she was  disappointed because she wanted to break the record.  </P> <P> "My goal coming in here today was to set the record," Drossin said. "I just  wanted to go out and run the best race I ever have. I'm happy with my  performance. I felt good the whole way. It would have been nice to have been  pushed at the end, but I still did OK."  </P> <P> Quintana also led the entire race, but he was pushed by Hartmann, who trailed  by 12 seconds after the first mile and 15 seconds after the second mile. He  made up time on the last half-mile of the race.  </P> <P> "I really had to turn the jets on coming over that last hill," Quintana said.  "I knew David was going to challenge me, but I didn't expect this much of a  challenge. I beat him by 19 seconds earlier this season, so he closed some  ground today."  </P> <P> James Menon of San Luis Obispo won the boys' individual sweepstakes in 15:28,  and Jeanine Rothman of Westlake won the girls' individual sweepstakes in 17:25  to become the third-fastest runner of all-time at Mt. SAC.  </P></p>

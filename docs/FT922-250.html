			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: Ives' Fourth Symphony - Music During concert intervals at the Festival Hall audiences are regularly treated to Ivesian collages, when the gentle reverberations of the South Bank's gamelan ensemble merge into the assorted muzak rising up from the record stall. On Saturday there was an opportunity to sample the real thing: the Philharmonia, conducted by Christoph von Dohnanyi, gave a rare London outing to Ives' Fourth Symphony, with the Philharmonia Chorus and Gareth Morrell drafted in as second conductor. It was a vivid, excellently co-ordinated performance; there is little expression 'interpretation' involved in such a piece, just a need to render these effects as carefully as possible. As one of the most hallowed icons of American experimentalism the Fourth Symphony continues to receive respectful performances; but it is not really a concert work, much more an interesting idea, a notional model that has served as inspiration for subsequent generations of American composers. Compared with their achievements - think of Carter's Concerto for Orchestra  -and, indeed, with Ives' own orchestral success Three Places in New England, it is awfully hit and miss, with so much textural mush to negotiate before the few moments of genuine poetic inspiration. Earlier Dohananyi had conducted Haydn's Symphony No 12 and accompanied Krystian Zimerman in Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Despite the rather martial orchestral contribution it was a wonderful performance, full of exquisite touch and colour, moments of unexpected wit and occasional fierce explosive emphases. In such form Zimerman is matchless; he has a range of articulation beyond the reach of any of his contemporaries, and a musical sensibility that puts these gifts to the best possible use.</p>

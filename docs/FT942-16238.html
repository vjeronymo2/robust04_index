			<p>940412 FT  12 APR 94 / Munich bans Kurdish rally Munich's mayor yesterday banned a pro-Kurdish demonstration planned for today. The ban follows a rally last month in Germany which ended in battles between police and Kuirds and protesters' self-immolation. Mayor Christian Ude said city authorities had 'reliable information' that Kurdish militants seeking an independent homeland in Turkey planned to use the rally to stage acts of violence. The charges of violence were denied by Kurdish and German organisers.</p>

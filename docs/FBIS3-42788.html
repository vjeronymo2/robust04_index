			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Resin, first deputy mayor of </F> Moscow, by LITERATURNAYA GAZETA columnist A. Gasparyan; place  and date not given: "Vladimir Resin: `Moscow Reflects Both the  Magnificence and the Misery of Present-Day Russia'"]    [Text] [Gasparyan] Vladimir Iosifovich, I would put my  first question this way. Just what is the image of Moscow? How  do you personally imagine it?    [Resin] I think that very many things go into this concept.  Beginning with the architecture of the historical part of the  capital and ending with the lifestyle of the ordinary  microrayon. Everything that surrounds us goes into the concept  of the "city's image." And, of course, the quality of the  functioning of the whole city's environment. I will begin with  the fact that Moscow is the capital of an enormous, wealthy, and  mighty state. But the paradox is that under normal conditions  there cannot be a rich state with a people whose standard of  living, to put it mildly, is not the very highest. But, you see,  this has happened here.    We are a mighty state! And Moscow is the capital of this  state, its face, which reflects the magnificence and the misery  of the whole country.    You and I have such creations as the Kremlin and the Bolshoi  Theater...and here right alongside we have 20 million square  meters of 5-storied buildings. But if these 5-storied buildings  are pulled down and modern buildings are built to replace  them--this will be far more expensive than the construction  itself. The question arises: What kind of a fool built them? No,  not a fool. This was a correct resolution of the housing problem  at that time. We brought people out of basements and  semi-basements.    [Gasparyan] How is the situation to be corrected now?    [Resin] There is a program that is directed at this. We  built  9 million square meters of housing in three years. Moreover, not  the same kind as before, but with the entire social and  engineering infrastructure.    Can you imagine for yourself that now in Butovo, for  example,  not all of the built kindergartens are full? There are schools  in Mitino that are not yet filled with pupils. Do you recall how  children were bused to neighboring schools? This happened. This  no longer exists.    [Gasparyan] But housing, nevertheless, is the main thing.  Today, not just long lines remain. The situation has changed. A  person stood in line for an apartment under socialism, but today  he has ended up in others, under market and capitalistic  conditions...    [Resin] I understood your question. Indeed, today we live  according to the principle of a bit from socialism, and a bit  from capitalism. At the same time, many want to work as if under  socialism, but to live as under capitalism. And what does this  lead to? All of us want to have a good apartment and to receive  it free of charge. Without giving anything to society. But,  nevertheless, the Moscow government did not abolish the lines,  because there would be social injustice. We retained them, while  in Kazakhstan and Ukraine housing lines have been abolished.    Last year, we provided housing for people in the 1981  waiting  line for housing. This year we want to take care of people in  the 1982 waiting line. But the line became stratified, like  society itself. People appeared who can buy an apartment, and  they are buying it. A housing market has emerged in our country.    We gave, are giving, and will continue to give to those who  cannot buy.    To put it briefly, we do not want to discard that which was  good under socialism. And let us look truth straight in the  eyes. We are all people of that time. Maybe our children and  grandchildren, as they say, will absolutely be market people.    I cannot pass by when I see that a person is in need. Even  if  he is pretending. But next to me is a stranger who does not even  look in the direction of a beggar, because he is brought up on  different principles.    [Gasparyan] Nevertheless, it seems to me that the image of  Moscow has started to disappear and become obliterated. Today,  the capital is not what it was before.    [Resin] Of course, during the years of Soviet authority  Moscow lost a big part of its individuality, you are right on  this.    But we have been doing a lot in the last three to four years  to return the former features of the capital. Have you noticed  that the center is being repaired and restored? The  Tretyakovskaya Gallery will be opened this year. The Malyy  Theater has been put in shape. The Metropole... We will open the  National this year.    But take a look at how carefully every building is being  treated that is being reconstructed.    [Gasparyan] Incidentally, many are saying that the  appearance  of Moscow is also getting worse, because many Western companies  are making everything in their own fashion. Is this being  monitored somehow?    [Resin] Nothing is done in Moscow without the permission of  the city planning council and the chief architect of the city.  The concept is based on an approved city plan foe Moscow  reconstruction. And none of the foreigners are permitted to  build if it does not coincide with the general plan of  reconstruction of the capital.    [Gasparyan] Nonetheless, many think that Moscow is basically  being sold to foreigners.    [Resin] First, this is not true. Second, have Americans  become impoverished because a big part of the buildings in  Manhattan has been sold to entrepreneurs of various countries?    But we have not sold anything. Indeed, individual stores and  buildings have been leased by Western firms or by joint  enterprises. Foreigners have started to pay taxes and have put  these premises in order, so that nothing damaging to Moscow has  occurred.    But a market is a market. So, we will also have to trade.  But  stability--both political and economic is needed so that someone  would buy something from us. You and I cannot brag about this at  the present time.    [Gasparyan] As the manager of the building department, are  you satisfied with the results of the work?    [Resin] The one who is satisfied with himself is a person  who  is lost to the economy. But in some things, yes. In the past  year we put into operation the Moscow City Palace of Justice,  the Moscow Art School under the Institute imeni Surikov,  maternity hospitals, a bridge crossing for the Moscow Zoo, such  unique structures as the Palace Hotel on Tverskaya Street, the  theater on Pokrovka, the exposition of private collections of  the Museum of Fine Arts imeni Pushkin, and the VTU [Higher  Technical School] imeni Shchukin on Vakhtanov Street. A number  of facilities of a cultural nature have been restored--the  Cathedral of the Icon of the Mother of God of Kazan, the Temple  of Saints Faith, Hope, and Love and Their Mother Sofia, and the  mosque on Zemlyachka Street.    However, despite the efforts being undertaken, it is still  difficult to call the situation with the reconstruction of the  center of the city satisfactory. Questions of engineering  support are being resolved with difficulty. Dates have been  postponed for the withdrawal of production enterprises and  lessees, the resettlement of tenants, and the formulation of  contractual relations of the prefectures of the Central  Administrative District with investors. Up to the present time,  26 parcels under the new housing construction program of work of  the past year have not been released. Also being  unsatisfactorily implemented is the release of structures  included in the reconstruction program from residents and lease  holders. A number of investors are not fulfilling their  contractual obligations. There continue to be cases of long  delays in assimilating released land parcels by involved  organizations.    A significant volume of work arose at the end of last year  in  connection with the tragic events of 3-4 October 1993, which  entailed partial destruction of the White House buildings, the  mayor's office, the Ostankino television center, and Hotel Mir.  During two months, 110,000 square meters were restored, and the  stylobate part of the White House was put into operation. Work  was started in the buildings of the Moscow's mayor's office and  Hotel Mir, and repair-restoration work was accomplished in the  Ostankino television center.    Last year, the practical implementation of the program of  low-story and cottage construction was started in the  Ramenskoye, Dmitrovskiy, Domodedogo, and Solnechnogorsk Rayons.    Cottages of a total area of about 60,000 square meters were  built and put into operation during 1993.    [Gasparyan] Of the transportation problems, obviously the  metro is closer to you, since this is associated with  construction...    [Resin] Indeed, it was and will continue to be necessary for  me to build the metro. And I must say that to build the metro as  we did up to the war, or in the first years of the war, is  simply impossible from the standpoint of costs. Why should we  establish a museum under ground? What does this give us other  than making travel on the metro more expensive? Therefore, they  have now started to build good quality--as was built before--but  at the same time also without any extravagances.    The metro in Moscow remains the most reliable, profitable,  and quickest form of transportation. Therefore, despite all of  the difficulties, we are continuing to build it, extending  branches into all new microrayons. We will now introduce new  housing complexes in Lyublin, and we are immediately providing  for the metro as well.    Of course, the outward appearance of surface transportation  also reflects on the image of Moscow. Our trolley buses and  streetcars, of course, have become worn out. As a result of the  breakup of the Union, the renewal of the fleet is moving along  much more poorly. We are now compelled to organize the  production of buses at the ZIL [Likhachev Automobile Plant).    Now about roads. The volume of repair work increased sharply  in recent years. The asphalt has become better and, accordingly,  the roads have become better. But, in general, the  transportation problem in Moscow has not been resolved yet. I  think that we made a serious mistake in yielding to the pressure  of "public opinion," which in the 1980's prohibited the building  of a third beltway. And, after all, large sums of money were  spent. We have now once again undertaken to build a third  beltway and, I think, the situation will improve with the  completion of its construction.    [Gasparyan] There are still other facilities from which the  appearance of the city is formed. These are the railroad  stations...    [Resin] I agree. Let us first look at the outward appearance  of Moscow's railroad stations. The Kiev railroad station has  already been put into shape, it was renovated, and it is an  excellent structure. The Paveletskiy is on the whole an  adornment of Moscow, and it also was put into shape. The Kursk  railroad station has been rebuilt, and it is one of the best  buildings in Moscow, both from the standpoint of architecture  and city planning. Work is being done on the Kazan railroad  station. The Leningrad railroad station has been recovered and  put into order. As, moreover, has the Savelovskiy. Therefore, if  we are talking about the material status of the railroad  stations, they are all in good condition.    The situation at the railroad stations is another matter.  But  this does not depend on the architecture. Everyone has to work  on this. Both the MPS [Ministry of Railways] and the MVD  [Ministry of Internal Affairs]. Well, and of course, we are not  being idle--we are taking all measures to bring order there. The  successes are not significant, but, nevertheless, a drop in the  increase in crime at the railroads has been noted.    But it must be admitted that Moscow has turned out to be an  unprotected city. However, in bringing order, we cannot  sacrifice basic human rights. It would be easiest of all to  close Moscow, to adopt harsh measures, etc. Muscovites would be  satisfied. But we cannot do this. There is always more order  under a totalitarian regime than under a democracy. But since we  have already chosen the path of democracy, then it is necessary  to understand what the costs will be here.    We are paying a lot of attention now to reinforcing the  Moscow militia. Not in words, but in deeds. The mayor is  personally looking into these questions. Large resources have  been allocated to raise the prestige of workers in the militia  and to improve its physical facilities.    Last year, 25 modern, new local militia stations were built.  Instead of the two or three that were built previously each  year. And no fewer will be built this year. These are militia  stations with garages, with shooting ranges, and with recreation  rooms. Briefly, everything that is necessary today for such a  station. Moreover, we built everything using the most beautiful  decorative materials.    The leadership of the militia has also been strengthened.  Lieutenant General Vladimir Iosifovich Pankrat is a highly  professional manager, a person who knows his business.    [Gasparyan] Concern for the militia is extremely important.  But what about the social protection of the poor?    [Resin] Of course, as the manager of the department, I  should  think about the builders first of all. The housing question  continues to be the most acute for the builders themselves as  well. Last year, it was proposed to improve the housing  conditions of more than 4,000 builders' families, with an  allocation for this on the order of 200,000 square meters. By  the beginning of the year, 60 percent of what was planned was  taken care of. At the present time, orders for the remaining  volume of housing area are being formulated.    The problem of social protection for the poor workers of the  branch is also not alien to us. Ten charitable actions in the  sum of about a billion rubles [R] have been conducted for  veterans, participants in the Great Patriotic War, and for large  worker families. Incidentally, the construction complex was the  only branch in the city economy of Moscow that maintained  children's health improvement camps. Thirteen such camps, in  which 10,000 children rested, were opened in the summer period.    [Gasparyan] And what can you say about places of leisure for  Muscovites? In my opinion, there are fewer areas like this now...    [Resin] We are building them. Victory Park on Poklonnaya  Hill, for example. Last year, we put the initial complex of a  building park into operation, and just before 9 May the opening  of the first line of this memorial was held. Construction has  started on a Disneyland kind of children's park in Mnevniki. I  think that we will build it in the course of 10 years. Moreover,  Russia does not yet have this kind of a park. Meanwhile, Gorkiy  Park is operating, and it is not in bad condition. But, then,  the VDNKh [Exhibit of Achievements in the National Economy] has  really been transformed into something that is not  comprehensible.    [Gasparyan] The mutual relations of Moscow and Moscow  Oblast.  There are also a lot of disputes about this. Some are for  unification, and others, for separation. What is your viewpoint  on this problem?    [Resin] Personally, I think that Moscow and the oblast are,  of course, a single region, and they cannot develop without each  other. And for all practical purposes, we are developing  together. This separation has been artificial, according to the  party-communist principle. There were obkoms [oblast party  committees] and gorkoms [city party committees]. But at the  present time, the basis for unification has been lost. Many  residents of Moscow Oblast are not in the mood for this. It  seems to them that Muscovites will make life in the Moscow  suburbs worse.    As long as our friends from Moscow Oblast do not change  their  views, it is impossible to talk about any kind of unification.    [Gasparyan] Do you, Vladimir Iosifovich, believe in the  reorganization of Moscow into a true capital of Russia with its  own inimitable image?    [Resin] Moscow today is already the most beautiful city in  the world. And we do not plan to change it architecturally. We  will adhere to that concept that evolved back in the 19th  Century. We will restore what was destroyed and what has become  dilapidated. But in no case will we destroy that appearance of  the city that was left to us by our fathers, grandfathers, and  great grandfathers. This is unequivocal.    For example, we will very likely lower the building of the  Intourist Hotel on Tverskaya Street, and it will correspond to  the style of Tverskaya Street.    I call on Muscovites to come to the city planning exhibit,  which was visited by the Russian president, to look it over, and  to express your opinion. We will try to take all interesting  opinions and proposals into account. After all, Moscow is our  common home.</p>

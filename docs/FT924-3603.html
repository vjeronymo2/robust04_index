			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / People: Salomon goes global This year's list of 21 new managing directors at Salomon Brothers exhibits a markedly more international flavour than in previous years, with as many as 8 of the 21 new managing directors based in London and a further 3 in Japan. This reflects not only the solid and increasing profitability of the London operation in recent years, but also a change in philosophy at the top of the Wall Street investment bank since the arrival of British-born Deryck Maughan as chairman and chief executive officer. Salomon normally appoints around 20 managing directors at a time; last year just three were London-based. Including the new appointments, there are 130 managing directors worldwide, with 21 in London. The new managing directors are: Henry Clark III, Mark Davis, Gregory Erardi, David Fisher, James Forese, Ellis Jones, David Levy, John Lipsky, Jonathan Sandelman, and George Shapiro. In London, Salomon has appointed Jeremy Amias, Simon Bowden, Paul Brewer, Frederic DiGuisto, Bruno Gabriele, Sara McKerihan, David Turnbull, and Steven Tye. In Japan, the three are: Louis Faust, Yoshihiro Mikami and Ikuo Morimoto. ***** Christopher Dreyfus has been appointed a director of RIVER &amp; MERCANTILE AMERICAN TRUST. ***** Stephen Denford, formerly a director of 3i, is joining SUMIT Equity Ventures.</p>

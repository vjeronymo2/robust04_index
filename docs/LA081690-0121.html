			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VIEW FINDER: ODDS &amp; ENDS AROUND THE VALLEY  </P> <P> Yuppie Alert  </P> <P> Kirk Minard, assistant manager at Irvine Ranch market in Woodland Hills, is  wondering where all the yuppies have gone.  </P> <P> When the upscale market offered to shop and deliver groceries for people --  such as the busy, young, upwardly mobile three-piece suits who work in Warner  Center -- he was expecting to be inundated with fax and phone orders.  </P> <P> It didn't happen, and Minard is puzzled.  </P> <P> He thinks it's a good deal. There is no charge for the shopping, and it only  costs $5 for the food to be delivered anywhere in the Valley. If you live  within five miles of the market, delivery's free between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. any  day of the week. The meat manager does the meat and poultry shopping, and the  produce manager does the produce shopping, which means, Minard said, the  customer gets the best of everything in the store.  </P> <P> But so far, it's only been mostly older, homebound people who have taken  advantage of the offer.  </P> <P> The lack of delivery business could be because people in the Valley aren't used  to having their shopping done for them, or delivered -- unlike their  counterparts in Pasadena and Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rocking for Cityhood  </P> <P> When Malibu was raising money for cityhood, it trotted out some of its  residents, who happened to be music or movie or television stars, and got other  people to pay to party with them.  </P> <P> Calabasas, now trying to incorporate, is sort of doing that by offering up  Toto's Bobby Kimball, Chuck Negron from Three Dog Night and the Iron  Butterfly's Mike Pinera at the Cityhood Committee's Rock 'n' Roll fund-raiser  Saturday at the Calabasas High School football stadium.  </P> <P> None of the entertainers live in, around or near Calabasas, but it's sort of  the same idea says Bob Hill, a committee spokesman. He's confident about the  quality of the show, but is a little nervous about the turnout. Before, when  the Cityhood Committee was trying to fatten up the financial war chest, it just  threw a party at the Calabasas Cantina, the funky, Wild West bar next to the  Leonis Adobe that is the Calabasas community's answer to a Town Hall.  </P> <P> This time the committee went for something a little more ambitious and Hill is  concerned that people don't know about the event. The show, which is an  established touring group featuring 10 rock acts, has been received well by  audiences all over the country. The concert starts at 6 p.m. Saturday, and  tickets are $18 at the door.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computer Doc  </P> <P> When you go jogging does your nose run faster than your feet?  </P> <P> Do you turn the color of a strawberry if you eat one?  </P> <P> Do certain grains blow you up like an inflatable raft?  </P> <P> Now you may be able to help your doctor find out what is wrong with you by  tracking your own eating habits.  </P> <P> All you need is a personal computer and $10 for a floppy disc called the Food  and Food Additive Sensitivity Analysis.  </P> <P> The disc, which comes with some written instructions, helps you track what  you've been biting into that may be biting back.  </P> <P> You accumulate the data as outlined in the instructions, and then send the disc  or a printout to Optimum Health Labs of Van Nuys. You get an analysis of what  is causing your chronic recurring symptoms for which no definite allergy  triggers have been found.  </P> <P> Armed with this information, you may have to spend less time in the company of  your physician, who might otherwise want to do those scratch tests that look as  if someone is playing Tic Tac Toe on your back.  </P> <P> If your allergies seem mild enough to you, you might want to simply try the  detailed meal planning guides that will keep you from eating whatever food or  food additives that has been giving you the miseries.  </P> <P> This disc is the wonderwork of a Dr. Eliot Light of Positech in Monterey, who  worked with Optimum Health Labs to develop the program.  </P> <P> It is being offered through DemoSource in Chatsworth, which is, according to  its president Brian Berman, a national clearinghouse that offers software  programs that can do anything from putting jokes into your speeches to  balancing your budget. For information, call DemoSource at (800) 283-4759.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Foster Fidos  </P> <P> Spirit, a 2-year-old golden retriever, and Chavez, a 2-year-old husky, were  parked at Dr. William Gregory's Woodland Hills animal hospital for more than a  month after their owner moved and didn't have a fenced yard at his new home.  </P> <P> Lisa Braverman, 25, and Lisa Zager, 26, dog groomers for Paws and Claws canine  beauty parlor in Woodland Hills, heard about Spirit and Chavez and decided to  become foster parents. The owner of the dogs told the Lisas that he would be  grateful if they could keep the dogs until new homes could be found.  </P> <P> Braverman took Chavez home to Calabasas, and Zager took Spirit to Woodland  Hills. Each already has a full quota of dogs and other animals at each  residence, so they keep asking people who come into Paws and Claws if they  would like another pet.  </P> <P> Becoming foster parents to dogs has become something of a habit for the Lisas.  </P> <P> A few months ago the two young women rescued two other dogs orphaned when their  mistress died, each Lisa taking one home. New families were found for both  dogs.  </P> <P> The Lisas also helped dog trainer Judy McGraw find a home for Amber, a year-old  Wheaton terrier, who was left behind when her owners moved. McGraw, owner of  Your Dog 'N' You training service in Van Nuys, took the dog in and called the  Lisas, who gussied up Amber to help her find a new home. Amber is now one of  two Wheaton terriers who permanently reside in a Van Nuys back yard.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Overheard  </P> <P> "I forgot my shopping list so I'll have to try and visualize it."  </P> <P>  -- Young mother to her preschooler at Gelson's market  </P></p>

Korean Students Slam Campus Suppression" -- KCNA </F> headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- About 200 students of  Chonnam National University of South Korea formed an Emergency  Measure Committee to denounce the search of campuses and defend  the Kwangju-South Cholla Provincial Federation of General  Student Councils (Namchongnyon) on June 19 before launching an  all-night sit-in strike, a radio report from Seoul said.    The students strongly denounced the puppet authorities for  hurling police into their university, walking away students and  perpetrating search and confiscation for the mere reason that  students in this area went to Seoul to participate in a people's  rally to check the "parliamentary endorsement of the Uruguay  Round accord" and held protests.    The students pointed out that the puppet authorities'  suppression is aimed at disuniting the Namchongnyon, and  demanded an immediate release of their fellow students.</p>

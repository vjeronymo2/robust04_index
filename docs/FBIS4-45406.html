The Federal  Counterintelligence Service's regional administration is  spearheading the operation to expose the channels whereby this  "commodity," which is new to Novgorod, gets into the area. Our  correspondent interviewed Vladimir Belyasko, chief of the  Economic Counterintelligence Department.    Klebanova: Vladimir Mikhyalovich, this is the  second time that Novgorod has become a member of the Hanseatic  League [sentence as published]. Does it not seem to you that  this renown will be augmented by another kind of fame--the  region will appear on the sinister maps of the international  drugs business?    Belyaskoz: The illegal international circulation  of narcotics has become a real real problem recently. According  to our forecasts there is a danger that in the near future  Novgorod Oblast could become a major transit point for drugs  dealers. There is no actual large scale market for sales  yet--the number of drug addicts numbers a little over 100. Thus  the main danger is the smuggling of narcotics via Novgorod from  and into Russia. That is what the evidence of the past two to  three years suggests.    Klebanova: Is this connected with the arrival of  refugees and migrants, who bring with them not just their own  culture but also vices previously unknown to the inhabitants of  central Russia?    Belyasko: Partly yes. But the oblast's  geographical position--its proximity to Moscow and St.  Petersburg and the countries of the Baltic--is far more  attractive to criminal structures. In addition, the influx of  foreign tourists and business people is growing. Field reports  that are coming in show that some of the latter are involved in  the drugs business. Unfortunately, migrants from the southern  republics and Central Asia, to whom the Novgorod region has  hospitably thrown open its doors, are making their own  unfortunate contribution here, too. A. Proskuryakov has been  convicted of distributing 32 kg of marijuana while the Filippov  brothers have been imprisoned for possession of opium. Until  now these drugs have been produced from growing plants but there  is information to suggest that synthetic narcotics could appear  in the future.    Klebanova: What are the supply routes for this  "commodity"?    Belyasko: The means and contrivances vary, from  the traditional method of the courier to methods that are  utterly brazen. The "commodity" is simply sent in packages  through the post to various addresses in Novgorod.    Klebanova: Is it possible to draw the conclusion  that there are permanent channels and "professionals" already  operating in the oblast?    Belyasko: No specific stable groups have been  exposed yet but their signs are there. The growth of foreign  economic ties makes possible the expansion of contacts and in  addition to the "traditional" smuggling of raw materials and  weapons the illegal shipment of narcotics across the border  cannot be ruled out either. After all, it has to be borne in  mind that the drugs business means the "laundering" of very  large sums of money and prices for drugs are rising all the time.    Klebanova: Vladimir Mikhaylovich, several large  "foreign" diasporas have now formed in our country. Can you  tell us who is the main bearer of this evil which is assailing  the Novgorod region? I do not think that we will offend  anyone's national dignity in this instance because such  criminals violate not only state laws but also human and divine  laws. Not just those of the Novgorod region...    Belyasko: Unfortunately there have been cases in  which local inhabitants have also become embroiled in this  "dirty business." But in the main it is the Azerbaijanis who are  involved in the drugs business. Last year joint operations were  carried out with the relevant agencies from Kazakhstan and  Uzbekistan. The fact is that the campaign against the narcotics  trade will not succeed on one territory alone and for that  reason the special services of all states have an interest in  exposing, preventing, and thwarting the illegal circulation of  drugs.    Klebanova: Workers of the law enforcement agencies  often attribute the ineffectiveness of the fight against the  spread of the contagion to the absence of the necessary  legislative base...    Belyasko: In this case we have the necessary  articles of the law covering the whole range of the problem.  But if you take into account that Russia is as yet not  assimilated into the international drugs market you can see that  preemptive legislation is needed. This work is already in hand  and professional conferences are being held at various levels  where the long-term is also discussed. But it is necessary to  strengthen cooperation with the special services in the West,  which have great experience in this field. International  agreements and massive joint actions are also needed. [Belyasko  ends]    The theme of the interview with Vladimir Belyasko was not a  happy one. But I must admit that after the conversation with  this worker from the "secret front line," I was not left with a  sense of overwhelming despair, as is often the case.  Nevertheless, it is a good thing that we have an agency which  is not only fighting the onset of this ever-expanding evil but  is also considering possible ways in which the latter might  launch its attack and the prospects for repulsing it. So  perhaps we will not have to drain this bitter cup of narcotics  to the very bottom. Perhaps it will pass us by.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, June 15 (CTK) -- Czech Premier and Chairman  of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the strongest party in the  government coalition, said today he had no information about the  appearance of a conservative faction within the ODS other than  that from the press and would not therefore take any stand on  the issue.    ODS Deputy Richard Mandelik said in the independent daily  LIDOVE NOVINY today that the views of a group of about 11 ODS  deputies differ considerably from those of the rest of the  deputies, especially regarding their attitude to the Jewish  property restitutions and the Senate issue. He also said that  Klaus had allegedly not objected to the "conservative wing." "I  believe that he, too, prefers conservatism to liberalism,"  Mandelik said.    Petr Kohacek, another ODS deputy, today resolutely rejected  Mandelik's statement. He said that although the discussion on  every issue usually begins in the ODS deputies' group with the  presentation of different and often opposite views, after a time  it results in a joint stand.    The chairman of the ODS deputies' group, Jiri Honajzer, in  an  interview with CTK today, expressed surprise over Mandelik's  allegation. He said he did not believe that the appearance of  party factions, which is usual in large parties in Western  Europe and elsewhere in the world, was something tragic or bad.    It is normal, natural, and legitimate he said that within  the  ODS deputies' club, which with its more than 60 members is the  largest group in parliament, all the questions took more time to  be discussed than in other clubs. He said there were many  strong politicians with different views in the group and their  views should not necessarily always be identical.</p>

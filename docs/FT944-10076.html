			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Men in the News: The awkward triangle - Dole, Gingrich and Gramm Dickens would have had fun with the names Dole, Gingrich and Gramm, perhaps making them a modest firm of Victorian solicitors supposedly protecting widow's mites but actually taking a little off the top. The modern DG&amp;G, however, is entirely different - outspoken, moneyed and so powerful that this week it left the president of the United States politically much poorer and half-pleading for mercy. On the surface, little appears to separate the current senior partners, Senator Robert Dole, 70, of Kansas, Congressman Newt Gingrich, 51, from Georgia and Senator Phil Gramm, 52, of Texas. They are all white male Protestant Republicans, shown in the mid-term elections to be the dominant political class, and they represent parts of the country which have either always been conservative or which have moved increasingly to the right in recent years. All worked tirelessly for Tuesday's landslide. Mr Dole, as senior Republican in the Senate, has been the party's titular head since President George Bush's defeat in 1992, Mr Gingrich was its principal strategist and also cheerleader in races for the House, while Mr Gramm performed the same electoral function in the Senate. Subcutaneously, however, there are divisions that may make this week's harmony illusory, and they seem to split the three into couples. Two (Dole and Gingrich) will from January run the two chambers of Congress, as Senate majority leader and as Speaker of the House respectively. Two (Dole and Gramm) would like to be elected president in 1996. The two PhDs (Gingrich and Gramm) are ideologues, true believers in the conservative faith in less government and lower taxes. Two (Dole and Gramm) have wives with successful independent careers not unlike Hillary Clinton, who is forever feeling the lash of the Gramm and Gingrich tongues. Elizabeth Dole was transportation secretary under President Ronald Reagan and now runs the American Red Cross, while Wendy Gramm was formerly head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Two (Gingrich and Gramm) are a generation younger than the third. The larger apparent differences, partly a product of age, are between Dole and Gingrich. Though unabashedly partisan and sometimes as mean as a junkyard dog, the senator's real milieu is Washington. He likes its high stakes wheeling and dealing and, fancying itself as a tough town, it likes his cutting sense of humour. But Gingrich loathes the political status quo, perhaps because he started in politics working for quintessential Republican moderate Nelson Rockefeller. As long ago as 1982, he was so furious at the outcome of a finance bill negotiated by Dole that he dismissed him as 'the tax collector for the welfare state'. Parts of this year's Republican manifesto - the 'contract with America' designed by Gingrich - leave Dole patently uncomfortable. Proud of being a professional politician, he dislikes the idea of imposing limits on the number of terms that may be served in Congress. Dole is also less fond of simplistic solutions than Gingrich and Gramm - like constitutional amendments to balance the budget or the 1980s budget-cutting process known as Gramm-Rudman - that promise gain without specifying the pain. He is less inclined than his two partners to eviscerate social programmes, partly because of his own history as an impoverished, wounded ex-soldier who was much helped early on by the welfare state. 'Government does a lot of good things,' he said this week. Gramm, though a flagwaver for the contract and second to none in his determination to cut government down to size, can also be disarmingly frank. He said this week he really did not know if the balanced budget amendment or term limits would serve any useful purpose, but since they were clearly the will of the people there was no point in resisting them. If there are signs of war between Dole and Gramm - and also with a powerful group of senior Republican moderates - for control of the Senate's legislative agenda, Gingrich faces no such constraints in the House. He had already mastered the existing membership by disposing of challenges nearly a year ago to his succeeding Bob Michel as leader and the new intake is largely shaped in his image. Unlike Dole and Gramm, he will not be distracted by presidential ambitions. The question is whether, after 14 years fighting a Democratic majority, he can temper his slash-and-burn ideologies to the realities of power. This week's evidence was mixed: he promised co-operation with the White House, but could not resist vilifying its present inhabitants as 'counter-culture McGovernicks' and 'left-wing elitists'. Though presumably not a candidate in 1996, Gingrich will be influential in the Republican selection. Of the firm's partners, he should logically prefer Gramm over Dole, but the field could be very large. Gramm, who has one of the Senate's better minds but one of its least attractive public personae, is definitely in the race and has Dollars 15m already in his campaign bank. It is tough to tell about Dole, but age and the sour memory of previous campaigns will count against him and he would not be the first to find managing the Senate incompatible with running for national office. He might, anyway, enjoy himself too much, which is precisely what DG&amp;G, in their present and understandable pomp, have been doing all week.</p>

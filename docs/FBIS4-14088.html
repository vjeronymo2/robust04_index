			<p>BFN     [Text] Tehran, April 26, IRNA -- The 27th "Mohammad (PBUH)  [peace be upon him] Rasulollah" Corps on Tuesday [26 April]  announced its readiness within the framework of the government's  policy, to march to the assistance of the defenceless people of  Bosnia along with all facilities at its disposal.    A press release by the corps, which saw service in the  imposed war (1980-88), supported the recent statement of the  leader of the Islamic revolution, Ayatollah Seyyed 'Ali  Khamene'i, in this regard.    In a separate statement, the Society of Imam Sadeq (AS)  university graduates, also announced their readiness to join in  the defence of aggressed Bosnia.    The students' basij (volunteers) of the university,  supported  the statement, and said Gorazde is a picture of mass oppression.  The minarets of mosques in Bosnia have become thorns for the  "savage society of the West", it added.    Army and IRGC [Islamic Revolution Guards Corp] forces over  the past few days denounced the gory massacre of Bosnians at the  hands of the Serbs and supported the call for despatch of  peace-keeping forces to the Bosnia-Herzegovina.</p>

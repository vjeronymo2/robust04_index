			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Sterling slips after rate cut STERLING held most attention in the foreign currency markets yesterday, after the Bank of England signalled a  1/2 percentage point cut in UK base rates, writes James Blitz. The UK currency dipped below DM2.92 shortly after lunch as investors who had bought sterling at around DM2.88 after the April general election took profits. However, traders reported a large amount of corporate buying of the currency shortly afterwards to help sterling finish at DM2.9250, half a pfennig down from its previous close. It also ended down against the dollar, at Dollars 1.7825, off  1/4 cent. Against its trade weighted index, the pound closed at 92.2 after opening at 92.4. In New York, sterling rallied to end at Dollars 1.7863. Analysts believe that, in spite of its late recovery yesterday, the rate reduction carries some downside risk for the UK currency. 'The gap between German and UK rates is now wafer thin,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist of Yamaichi International, 'and leaves sterling with little by way of support. The move has also shown the market that the UK authorities are prepared to use any chance they can to lower interest rates.' Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist of DKB International, also believes that the cut carries risks. 'It showed that the authorities are more worried about the weakness of the economy than anything else,' he said. High German rates were yesterday unsettling the US dollar as well. In European and North American trading, the US currency eased against the D-Mark, partly due to renewed hopes of a solution to the German labour strike. But the interest rate differentials between German and American rates were irresistible. As one dealer said: 'Germany may have its industrial problems. But it is hard to ignore that you can get 9 3/4 per cent interest on the D-Mark compared to about 3 3/4 per cent with the dollar.' In Europe, the dollar finished at DM1.6405, against DM1.6410. In New York it closed at DM1.6370. The only major currency not to lose out to the D-Mark yesterday was the French franc, which still enjoys investor popularity. An article in Le Monde, the French daily paper, suggested that there could be an impending revaluation of the currency. The D-Mark ended at around FFr3.3690, after opening at FFr3.3696. The dollar's difficulties stemmed mostly from last week's indifferent economic indicators. Analysts believe that employment data due at the end of this week should show a modest but positive improvement, but that investors will have to wait until further into the month of May before seeing clear signs of a recovery. The US unit closed at Y133.10, against a previous Y132.70. It was finally Y132.85 in New York.</p>

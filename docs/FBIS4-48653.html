			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Amrit Manga] </F>   [Text] As South African workers wake from the celebrations  over the democratic victory in last month's elections, COSATU  [Congress of South African Trade Unions] general secretary Sam  Shilowa has sounded a note of caution that could dampen some of  the euphoria.    This week, he told the 57th congress of the Canadian Union  confederation, CSN: "While we are happy, we are also uncertain."    Shilowa was referring to the challenges that lie ahead in  meeting the expectations of workers, many of which have been  raised by the ANC's electoral victory.    "We are gripped with fear, fear of whether our democracy  will  succeed, fear of being forgotten by the international community,  fear of being unable to fulfill our members' expectations," he  told the union meeting in Montreal.    Their expectations, Shilowa said, were for more jobs,  houses,  better living conditions, better wages, improved labour  legislation, electricity and water.    Although Shilowa did not say so, these are expectations  workers have of the ANC-led government of national unity.    They make up the core of the Reconstruction and Development  Programme (RDP) and will cost at least R [Rand] 80-billion on  the basis of the ANC's latest estimates.    While a significant part of these costs will be met by  revenue generated inside the country, there is little doubt that  foreign aid will also play a role.    Shilowa was direct in his assessment of just how long it  will  take for some of the expectations built up around the RDP to be  met.    "All of these can't be achieved overnight. It will take  time. It needs resources, it needs the support of our members."    Shilowa also used the opportunity to justify COSATU's role  in  the liberation struggle. "Many people have condemned us for  being a political union. We do not apologise. If calling for a  better life for all is political, so be it," he said.    "If opposing wasteful government expenditure is political,  so  be it," Shilowa added.    An underlying warning in the COSATU general secretary's  message appeared to be that his federation would not become  complacent under the new conditions but that it would continue  to speak out against wasteful expenditure and mismanagement in  government.</p>

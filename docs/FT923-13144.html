			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Economists wrestle with Bundesbank riddle WHAT the Bundesbank could do to interest rates tomorrow in its battle to curb German money supply left the continent's equity markets stultified, once again, yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. Economists wrestling with the options open to Buba have tended to decide that it will either do nothing, increase the discount rate (but not the Lombard rate) or directly reduce the amount of money that it supplies to the Germany banking sector. 'Either move', said UBS Phillips &amp; Drew this week on the latter two options, 'would be likely to put pressure on banks' lending rates, but would not influence interbank money market rates.' Mr David Deakin of Nikko Bank (UK) said pointedly that high interest rates have sucked in the money market deposits which contributed to the offending German M3 figure. 'If the Bundesbank imposes further tightening this week,' he added, ' . . . it will compound the felony by making German interest rates even more attractive to the international depositors who already swell the M3 figure with their cash.' FRANKFURT ended narrowly mixed, the DAX index easing 2.40 to 1,734.10 after a decline of 0.76 to 686.32 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover rose from DM3.9bn to DM4.2bn. Among individual stocks, Degussa, whose exposure to the lower dollar is a matter of argument between its detractors and its fans, fell DM5.20 to DM324.50 marks. Another loser was Allianz, the insurer, which fell DM21 to DM2,219 on the break of a key technical chart point. Other fallers included Mannesmann, where there were profits to take, down DM3.50 to DM286.30; AMB, down DM10 to DM865 on news that its chairman will be replaced next month; and Asko, down DM11.50 at DM716 in sympathy with poor figures, and a share price slump at its Swiss-based Adia subsidiary. The mood of the day was generally short of enthusiasm. This was reflected in the shipbuilder, Bremer Vulkan, which tried for approval with a 113 per cent jump in group net profits for 1991 despite a 13% decline in sales, seemed to get it iniitally with a DM3 rise to DM92.30 but eventually closed unchanged at DM89.30. MILAN rose on short-covering ahead of the close of the July trading account today but closed off the day's highs. Stocks which go ex dividend on Thursday remained in demand. The Comit index rose 6.71 or 1.5 per cent to 447.76 in turnover estimated at near Monday's L82.9bn. Among industrial blue chips, Fiat rose L139 or 2.7 per cent to L5,260 while Montedison gained L30 or 2 per cent to L1,440. Olivetti was also firmer, adding L68 or 2.3 per cent to L3,065. James Capel has downgraded its estimates for the computer company because it believes that there is still no evidence that the bottom of the information technology cycle has been reached. The broker now expects it to remain in the red in 1992 with a loss of L100bn, having previously expected a return to profit, of L12bn. ZURICH extended its preoccupation with second-liners, the temporary employment group, Adia, topping the active list as it fell SFr42 to SFr216 for a cumulative drop of SFr120, or 36 per cent since early last week on a poor outlook for profits. The SMI index of leading shares closed 6.4 lower at 1,835.1. Second on the active list was a recent high-flyer, the watchmaker, SMH, which fell SFr15 to SFr1,330 on profit-taking. MADRID went into reverse again, but closed above its worst with the general index down 1.21 to 234.54 against an intraday low of 233.31. Construction stocks led the way down, reflecting the sector's vulnerability to cuts in public spending and featuring a Pta420 drop to Pta6,060 at Cubiertas, Pta55 to Pta1,415 at Dragados and Pta48 to Pta782 for Uralita. OSLO fell 1.7 per cent to a new 1992 low in thin trading, led down by shipping shares on renewed pessimism about chances for higher chartering rates. The all-share index closed 6.75 weaker at 384.30 in turnover worth NKr109m. The shipping index closed almost 3 per cent weaker, with Bergesen A shares falling NKr4 to NKr91. TEL AVIV rallied in active trading, buoyed up by confirmation of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's new government. The blue chip shares index rose 2.21 or 1.5 per cent to 155.15 in turnover of Shk139m. AMSTERDAM was slightly firmer but trading was very thin as investors stuck to the sidelines ahead of the Bundesbank's meeting on Thursday. The CBS Tendency index rose 0.4 to 121.3. VIENNA's decline was exacerbated by a weaker futures and options market, as the ATX index went as low as 830.19 before rebounding to end 1.21 down at a record closing low of 863.86. Paris remained closed for the Bastille holiday and will re-open today. Metrologie Internationale, the electrical equipment distributor indirectly controlled by Paribas, said its shares will be suspended today ahead of the announcement of a major asset sale.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                     FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - Jul 14                           Hourly Changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Open     10.30am    11am     12pm     1pm      2pm      3pm     close 1123.92   1124.42  1124.21  1123.72  1123.66  1123.95  1123.42  1124.22  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 Day's High 1125.41       Day's Low 1123.18  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        Jul 13        Jul 10       Jul 9       Jul 8     Jul 7       1121.63       1129.14     1128.17      1121.53   1129.83  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

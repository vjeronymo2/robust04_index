Provincial party committee Secretary Xie Shijie yesterday  attended and relayed the spirit of the sixth provincial party  committee second plenary session at the study class at which  provincial party committee Deputy Secretary Qin Yuqin also made  a speech.    Secretary Xie Shijie pointed out in his speech: The sixth  provincial party committee second plenary session, which  concluded on 21 December, had implemented to the letter the  spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee and the spirit of a recently concluded national  economic work conference. The important plenary session had also  made specific arrangements for Sichuan's work in 1994.    After briefly reviewing Sichuan's work in 1993, Secretary  Xie  Shijie spelled out the following tasks and requirements for 1994:    1. To strive to acquire a correct understanding of the  current situation, enhance a sense of opportunity, press ahead  with all- round development, and intensify a sense of historical  responsibility.    2. To closely integrate reform, opening up, and  construction, adopt an overall point of view, concentrate on key  aspects of work, and quicken the pace of economic development.    3. To keep close watch over new developments and new  problems, continually and firmly grasp two key aspects of work  at the same time, safeguard social stability, and push ahead  with social progress and development.    Comrade Qin Yuqin stated in his speech: During 15 days of  theory study, county party committee secretaries from across  Sichuan have conscientiously studied Volume 3 of the  Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, all documents issued  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee,  and the spirit of the recently concluded national economic work  conference. They also listened to a number of work reports and  scored relatively gratifying results in theory study. Thanks to  these study activities, all county party committee secretaries  have now acquired an in-depth understanding of the ideological  line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts,  which constitutes the essence of Volume 3 of the Selected  Works of Deng Xiaoping, as well as the theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, which constitutes the  main theme of Volume 3 of the Selected Works of Deng  Xiaoping. They have also further emancipated their minds,  successfully removed a variety of ideological obstacles  hampering Sichuan's development, deepened their understanding of  such a question as why a socialist market economic structure  should be built, enhanced comprehension of the basic principle  underpinning socialism with Chinese characteristics which is  continually and firmly grasping two key work aspects at the same  time.    Comrade Qin Yuqin also called for continually and profoundly  studying and conscientiously implementing all strategic tasks  laid down at the 14th CPC National Congress, further updating  ideological concepts, and cultivating a fine style among broad  masses of party members and cadres, especially leading cadres at  and above the county level, in order that all comrades will  attach importance to theory study and respect science.</p>

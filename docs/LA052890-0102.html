			<p><P> May 28, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THOMPSON REBOUNDS FOR EASY VICTORY IN IRVINE;  </P> <P> BIATHLON: ENCINITAS RUNNER MAKES UP FOR LAST-PLACE FINISH IN HIS LAST RACE.  DOWNING WINS WOMEN'S TITLE AGAIN.  </P> <P> Joel Thompson, after finishing last in his division in his last race, finished  two minutes ahead of the pack Sunday when the Coors Light Biathlon Series came  to Orange County.  </P> <P> The 31-year-old professional biathlete from Encinitas, finished the  approximately five-kilometer run, 30-kilometer bicycle course and another  five-kilometer run in 1:09.39. Race officials thought he had broken the Series  record until the run and bicycle courses were found to be slightly shorter than  the standard distances.  </P> <P> Thompson said he was able to improve during the last week since his  disappointing finish in Houston by "relaxing."  </P> <P> "I'd done the work," Thompson said. "I just thought I was over the edge. . . .  I was trying to do a little bit too much. I finally just rested. I knew I was  set, based on some workouts I'd done, but after last week I was sure beginning  to wonder."  </P> <P> Thompson's time in Houston was 1:18.46.  </P> <P> Liz Downing, the 1989 Coors Light Series champion from Portland, Ore., won the  women's elite division for the second year in a row.  </P> <P> Downing, who finished in 1:18.56, attributed her victory Sunday and her  two-year dominance of the biathlon series to her ability as a cyclist.  </P> <P> "I think it's just that I'm a little stronger on the bike than the other  women," she said. "Because a lot of them are pretty decent runners and I'm not  a great runner. . . . I think it's just that I've been able to put a little  time on them on the bike."  </P> <P> Downing also said the course around the El Toro Marine Corp Air Station  complemented her racing style. "The course, I guess, is a little bit easier  because you can't see who's in front of you very far because you have so many  corners," she said. "Sometimes, if you're out of sight, it helps a little bit.  So I always run scared, try to get around the next corner."  </P> <P> Thompson and Downing will each receive $10,000 for their victories.  </P> <P> Thompson was followed by Brent Steiner (Tempe, Ariz.), 1:11.53; Greg Welch (San  Diego), 1:11.54, and Matt Gary (Roseville, Calif.), 1:11.59, in the men's elite  division.  </P> <P> Steiner, Welch and Gary also finished the first run and the bicycle race fairly  close together. "They were there all the way," Steiner said. "On the bikes,  Matt (Gary) and I were together. Greg (Welch) kind of slipped a bit in the  bikes, I think. But he came back in the second run great."  </P> <P> Other county finishers in the men's top 40 were No. 5 Greg Brown (Balboa  Island), 1:11.54; No. 8 Darren Wood (Newport Beach), 1:13.03; No. 9 Eric  Squires (Laguna Niguel), 1:13.22; No. 19 Ray Webb (Anaheim Hills), 1:16.36; No.  22 Jeff Montgomery (Huntington Beach), 1:17.29; No. 31 John Brazelton (Newport  Beach), 1:18.37, and No. 39 Jim Van Sickle (Laguna Beach) 1:19.36.  </P> <P> George Pierce, the 1989 Coors Light men's champion from Thousand Oaks, was  disqualified for drafting.  </P> <P> Donna Landerville, a Seattle runner in her second-ever biathlon, took second  place in the women's elite division in 1:20:27.  </P> <P> Landerville gave Downing a scare on the bicycle course. "That one girl who was  in second -- I didn't know who she was," Downing said. "She wasn't very far  behind me. I said, 'Jeez! Either she's really good or I'm really hurting.' "  </P> <P> Landerville was followed by Melissa Mantak (Denver), 1:21:06; Kimberly Cohen  (Greenwich, Conn.), 1:23:21, and Catherine Donovan (Santa Monica), 1:24:09.  </P> <P> Other county finishers in the women's top 40 were No. 13 Suzanne Ferguson (Dana  Point), 1:29.12; No. 15 Marilyn Sanahl (Orange), 1:31.14; No. 18 Jeannette  Gueffroy (Santa Ana), 1:32.42; No. 20 Sue E. Davis (Costa Mesa), 1:33.13; No.  23 Julie Pizzarello (Santa Ana), 1:34.10; No. 26 Christina Rudd (Newport  Beach), 1:35.44; No. 30 Dawn Braund (Laguna Beach), 1:36.20; No. 33 Margie Dana  (Mission Viejo), 1:37.24; No. 34 Valerie McCutchan (Costa Mesa), 1:37.33, and  No. 35 Ursula Hill (Santa Ana), 1:38.08.  </P> <P> The race was completed by 674 professional and amateur biathletes.  </P></p>

			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Revenue criticises DTI proposals on creditors THE Inland Revenue yesterday criticised Department of Trade and Industry proposals that threaten its preferential status as a creditor to companies in financial difficulties. It argued that its priority ranking above other creditors was 'necessary', and wants it to be maintained in any changes to insolvency legislation. The comments were in response to a DTI consultative document issued on Tuesday which called for an overhaul of existing procedures for company voluntary arrangements (CVAs) and administration orders. The document said some countries were eliminating or reducing the number of preferential tax creditors, and suggested that 'Crown preference' for pay-as-you-earn, value added tax and other measures could be removed. Banks yesterday maintained their tentative support for the proposals, which would require them to lose some of their rights as priority creditors by abiding by CVAs and giving a company seven days' notice before appointing receivers. One banker said he supported the principle of trying to rescue more companies. But he questioned how far the proposals would succeed. 'So many of the companies we see are bust by the time they suggest a CVA,' he said.</p>

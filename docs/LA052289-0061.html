			<p><P> May 22, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Lebanon's rival leaders united in pleading with the Arab League to save their  country from destruction even though they remain as divided as ever on a  solution to the crisis. Acting Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Muslim, said in a  memorandum to the league -- which starts its summit Tuesday in Morocco -- that  the solution lies in reforms giving Muslims, unofficially estimated to form a  majority of Lebanon's 3.5 million people, an equal share in power with  Christians before the election of a new president. But the rival Christian-led  administration of Maj. Gen. Michel Aoun insists on the withdrawal of all  foreign troops as a main condition of any political settlement. Syria maintains  about 40,000 troops in Lebanon.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Moti Amir in Cairo] </F>   [Text] A news conference with Major General Amnon Shahaq  ended a few minutes ago. The bottom line of what Gen. Shahaq  had to say is that he is not sure the Cairo negotiations will be  completed this week.    [Begin recording] [Shahaq] I do not think that the  negotiations will be completed this week. Progress is  definitely being made because we work around the clock. We meet  and things are being settled, but there is still work to be  done. There is no cardinal issue on which there are  differences, but there are many issues for which there are still  no answers and with which we are currently dealing -- some of  which can become difficult to resolve and therefore important.    [Unidentified correspondent] Are there issues that will be  finalized after the agreement is signed?    [Shahaq] There will be issues that will be resolved after  the signing, and agreement must be reached on that as well. If  that happens, those issues will be put off and work on them will  continue immediately after the signing. [end recording]    Gen. Shahaq noted that he does know about any Peres-'Arafat  meeting in Cairo at the end of the week and refused to say which  issues remain controversial. He merely said that there are no  substantive disputes but that the small print must also be  negotiated. Asked what these issues are, he said:    [Begin Shahaq recording] I do not think it is significant,  even for you, because you are not sitting with a list and  checking off the issues. We have almost completed the  deliberations on civilian issues, but even that is not totally  accurate. Last week I mentioned passports, dialing zones,  stamps, and currency as issues on which agreement has not yet  been reached. There are also other issues on which we are still  deliberating. Some of the security issues have also been  completed, but I think it is pointless and irrelevant for most  people to become involved in the niceties. All the issues have  to be resolved. We referred earlier to the issue of crossings  and safe passage [last two words in English]. The gaps on those  issues are very, very small, and I think they will also be  settled this week. I think that when the week ends, we will  provide a list of all the issues completed this week. [end  recording]    On the agreement reached between Fatah and Hamas [Islamic  Resistance Movement] in the Gaza Strip, Gen. Shahaq stressed  that Israel will not accept agreements between the two  organizations that permit Hamas to continue attacking Israel.    [Begin Shahaq recording] As long as meetings between Fatah  and Hamas are devoted to resolving conflicts between them and to  the problems of Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, they do not  constitute a problem for us. If, however, they are meant to  provide a distribution of labor between Fatah, which will abide  by the agreement, and Hamas, which will take actions not  permitted in the agreement, that is not only unacceptable but  will not happen and will have an impact on the talks. I think  that is clear. We were told that this is not what took place  and will also not take place in the future. [end recording]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Northern League Secretary Umberto Bossi by </F> Guido Passalacqua in Milan; date not given: "Bossi: `What  Elections...?'-- `If the Government Falls, a New One Can Be  Formed"]    [Text] Milan -- Following a series of negative election  results, the League is now again a winner. In a number of  Lombard municipalities where, as [League Secretary] Umberto  Bossi said, "our roots are strongest," the Bandwagon [League  nickname] defeated Forza Italia. This signals the reversal of a  trend -- a reversal which began, Bossi said, "on that 25 April  when I marched alone in the midst of insults and catcalls. It  was not a comfortable choice, but I had to make it." Does this,  then, confirm that the Senator's [Bossi nickname] strategy (say  things clearly, highlight the League's specific identity,  identify Forza Italia as a conservative party while  simultaneously ensuring "governability") is beginning to bear  fruit? Speaking from his home in Gemonio, in the early  afternoon, Bossi tended to minimize events: "So, you want me to  make a statement about such a small development? This was only  a victory of the line based on reason." He then went on to call  a press conference in Milan. He spoke calmly, but his message  was unequivocal: Elections are not imminent, the League is  "alive and well," and finally "the League cannot agree with a  British-type single-round system."    [Passalacqua] Deputy Bossi, are you finally satisfied?    [Bossi] I have always anticipated things well in advance. I  seen no reason now to overemphasize the election results (In the  course of the press conference, he repeatedly put forward this  idea -- LA REPUBBLICA editor's note) but we are of course  receiving the right signals, a small signal perhaps, but I  believe we are getting some results.    [Passalacqua] After this election round, do you think early  elections are now closer or further away?    [Bossi] In my opinion [Prime Minister] Berlusconi's problem  is how to prevent governability from becoming the only asset  enabling him to win votes. In this country, governability is  guaranteed, safe. The League has no intention of calling it  into question.    [Passalacqua] Not everybody in the majority shares this  view.    [Bossi] If you like, their reckoning is legitimate.    [Passalacqua] Legitimate but dangerous...    [Bossi] It is others who reckon in this way. There is a  danger that Italy may become the European country facing the  greatest difficulties, that it may move from one election to the  next. When governability is not at stake, or when it becomes  more difficult to invoke it, then people demand values and  consistency. Look at what happened in Desio and Lissone, two  small towns near to where Forza Italia's leader lives. Voters  there preferred the League because they realized that when both  the League and Forza Italia guarantee governability, then ideals  and values must be rewarded, and when it comes to ideals and  values, we are unrivaled. Future battles will be fought on  values and consistency, particularly when people realize that  there are several government possibilities.    [Passalacqua] However, are early elections close or distant,  in your opinion?    [Bossi] They are much more distant today. This parliament  must complete its term. I like to keep my word, and I believe  the other allies have a stake in this, too.    [Passalacqua] You referred to several government  possibilities. What exactly did you mean?    [Bossi] I think the Freedom Alliance must be able to govern.  We helped Berlusconi to form a government. If this were  otherwise, the country might take a dangerous path. However,  the League maintains that democratic practice must be followed.  If we suddenly realize that the allies are aiming for early  elections, we will insist on democratic practice being  respected. This is why the League opposes the resignation of  the RAI's [Italian Broadcasting Corporation] know-it-alls.  Whatever steps are taken or not taken, there is a law saying  that, until 1995, appointments are decided by [Chamber of  Deputies speaker] Pivetti and [Senate speaker] Scognamiglio.  Therefore it is right for the know-it-alls to retain their posts.    [Passalacqua] What do you mean by "practice?"    [Bossi] If anyone resigns, institutional practice  establishes  that someone else will govern. When a pope dies, another one is  elected. I repeat, there is no chance of going to the polls. I  have the impression that false statements are being made about  Berlusconi in the press. This is why I intend to ask him  myself, personally. I believe there are people engaged in  slander and exaggeration campaigns.    [Passalacqua] In these elections, the League has both given  and taken votes from the Left. Are these the first steps along  the path you have marked out?    [Bossi] You are forgetting the center. In any case, the  League wanted to ensure the protest proposal would prevail. We  do not agree with throwing the country into chaos. We are not  pleased with the prospect. You see, the voters' support cannot  be diverted at will: Voters have rewarded a political force --  in a limited test -- whose values can be shared. When Forza  Italia and the League stand side by side, people vote for the  League.    [Passalacqua] Do you believe these elections have bolstered  your position in favor of a two-round electoral system?    [Bossi] Advocating two rounds does not depend on election  results. Rather, it results from a decision, namely the  decision not to support a single-party system. A double-round  system would enable a political force to retain its identity and  then enter into a coalition so as to ensure governability.</p>

			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Banks hit by interest rate curve ball: A look at the latest chapter in their long struggle to survive When Ichiro Suzuki of the Orix Blue Wave baseball team slugged his way into the record books this summer, becoming the first player in Japanese history to make 210 hits in a season, he was not just propelling his club to one of its best seasons ever. He was also setting interest rates for thousands of customers of the leading local bank in the port city of Kobe. As the season ended Hyogo Bank came up with a novel scheme that neatly exploited the country's two modern obsessions - baseball and saving. It offered customers an interest rate on five-year deposits of one-tenth of the prolific hitter's batting percentage for the season. Ichiro, as everyone knows him, achieved a club high batting average of 38.5 per cent, meaning he scored a hit on more than one in three attempts. So the bank offered customers a rate of 3.85 per cent for a minimum investment of Y100,000 (Pounds 630). The rate was just a little above prevailing market rates of around 3.7 per cent, and Hyogo's managers acknowledge that it was probably the enticement of an autographed baseball as much as an extra few thousand yen a year that brought the crowds queueing outside Hyogo's branches when the offer opened. But the real significance of the 'Ichiro Time Savings' account was that it opened a new chapter in the continuing saga of Japanese banks' struggle for survival. The bank was able to offer the special interest rate thanks to the final stage of the liberalisation of Japanese interest rates last month. The finance ministry removed the last controls on banks' deposits by permitting them to open five-year deposit accounts, and to set their own interest rates on all hitherto regulated time and demand accounts. The effect was predictable. Hyogo's innovation was the most novel of the banks' responses to the arrival of a new era of market economics, but the effect was the same everywhere - a small rise in savings rates. But while the reform was good news for customers, it spelt further problems for the banks themselves since it could hardly have come at a worse time. The removal of the last regulations now makes them more sensitive to interest rates at precisely the moment when the cost of borrowing is starting to rise. For the last four years interest rates have been falling as Japan has grappled with its worst recession since the second world war, but as the economy starts to recover a period of rising interest rates will weaken banks' profitability. According to Mr Nozomu Kunishige, banking analyst at Kleinwort Benson in Tokyo: 'Deregulation of deposit rates means banks' funding costs are set to rise sharply, while their revenues are likely to remain sluggish.' Deposit rates tend to rise more quickly than lending rates, leading to thinner margins. Since the end of 1993, banks' short-term prime lending rate has remained unchanged at 3 per cent, while deposit rates have risen. The three-month certificate of deposit rate has risen from around 2.0 to 2.3 per cent in the same period, cutting margins by 30 per cent. Worse still, the enormous hangover of bad debts from the collapse of the 'bubble economy', a period in the late 1980s of rapidly rising property and other asset prices, mean banks face limited demand for lending. That makes it difficult for them to raise their lending rate. Indeed in the last few months, some banks have been offering loans to blue-chip customers at rates well below prime lending rate. The position is even more precarious for the smaller regional banks such as Hyogo. They draw a far higher proportion of their funds from individual customers, where liberalisation is forcing rates even higher. Interest income accounts for more than 80 per cent of gross business profits at such banks. They are already heavily laden with bad debts which require substantial provisions from profits. In the past they were at least offered some protection by a very low cost of funds, as deposit interest rates were fixed at low levels. Now that advantage has disappeared. The likeliest implication, according to most analysts, is the further fracturing of the oligopoly that has characterised Japanese banking. In the past, banks have been notoriously hidebound by a desire to stay close to the pack. This natural inclination was reinforced by the strict control of the finance ministry. In the absence of competition in interest rates, differentiation was achieved by minor distinctions in marketing approaches. According to David Threadgold, banking analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, 'there is no doubt that banks' strategies are now diverging, and the deregulation of the last few years means pricing is a key part of that'. The strongest banks are likely to exploit their muscle; for the first time the gap between the strongest and the weakest will take on meaningful proportions. Though few dare say it now, that could even mean that the Japanese banking sector may come to experience what baseball has had all along - winners and losers.</p>

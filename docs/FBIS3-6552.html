			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In an emergency telephone conversation, Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu and U.S. Secretary of State Christopher  shared the view [insigul kachihada] that the efforts of the two  countries to solve the North Korean nuclear issue have reached  an important stage. They discussed measures to take henceforth.    Minister Han and Secretary Christopher agreed that the  nuclear inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency  [IAEA] was not satisfactory [sunjoropchi mottaha] and no  progress was made in the issue of exchanging North-South special  envoys. As the result, a third round of U.S.-North Korea talks  is undecided.    The foreign ministers of the two countries shared the view  that the two countries will make last-ditch efforts for dialogue  to persuade North Korea but will seek new measures --  omni-directional -- if the efforts for dialogue are not  successful.    The ministers of the two countries agreed that it is  important for the two countries to implement consistent measures  at this point under close mutual consultations.    In the conversation, Minister Han revealed that during  President Kim Yong-sam's visit to China beginning 26 March, the  North Korean nuclear issue will be discussed at a ROK-PRC summit  and in other occasions of consultation.</p>

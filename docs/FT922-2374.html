			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Carrian ex-head's trial halted The trial of Mr George Tan, the former chairman of the collapsed Carrian property and shipping company, was halted yesterday while the Crown asked the UK when Mr Lorrain Osman, a Malaysian banker, would be extradited to Hong Kong, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong. Counsel for Mr Tan told the colony's district court that Mr Kenneth Clarke, Britain's home secretary, had signed a warrant on Monday clearing the way for Mr Osman's return to stand trial, with Mr Tan, on fraud and conspiracy charges involving HKDollars 6bn (Pounds 418m) of loans from Bumiputra Malaysia Finance. However, Mr Osman, Britain's longest-serving remand prisoner, yesterday avoided immediate extradition after his lawyers launched a fresh High Court bid to win his freedom.</p>

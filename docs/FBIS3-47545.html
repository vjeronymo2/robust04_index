			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A reversal in the balance of power between Japan  and the United States in international stock investments has  become evident. U.S. foreign stock investments (buying on  balance) in 1993 was 2.5 times that of the previous year,  totalling more than $120 billion. This surpassed Japan's  investments at its peak (in 1989; $120 billion). Backed by low  interest rates in the United States, capital from pension funds  and personal investment trust funds flowed into the stock  markets in Asia, Europe, and Latin America. On the other hand,  Japanese investment in foreign stocks (buying on balance) was  around $36 billion from January to November 1993, equivalent to  less than one-third of the U.S. investments. This switch of  leading player in international stock investments reflects the  change in the balance of power in the international financial  market brought about by the economic recovery in the United  States and the prolonged recession in Japan.    According to statistics compiled by the U.S. Federal Reserve  Board (FBR), stock investments of U.S. residents in foreign  countries for the whole of 1993, estimated from figures for  January to September, exceeded $120 billion. Until 1988, U.S.  foreign stock investments had been less than $10 billion yearly.  This started to increase in the second half of 1989, and has  grown rapidly in the 1990's. Behind this increase is the  expansion of investment funds from the pension funds and  investment trust funds.    With the increase in available capital, U.S. pension funds  began to turn to stock markets in Europe, Asia, and Latin  America, where the United States used to take a more cautious  approach. Moreover, personal funds withdrawn from bank accounts  due to low interest rates have also gone into overseas markets  through investment trust funds.    According to the U.S. investment trust association ICI  [Investment Company Institute], net capital flow into overseas  investment trust funds from January to October 1993 was $26.6  billion, about four times that of the comparable period in the  previous year.    In 1993, the upheaval in the foreign exchange mechanism of  the European Monetary System (EMS) subsided, and stock markets  in the European countries enjoyed stable growth. This added  fuel to investments from the United States. Furthermore, "the  flow of capital into the Mexican market in anticipation of the  signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and  the Southeast Asian countries, which continued to enjoy high  economic growth," was subtantial (according to the Nomura  Research Institute).    On the other hand, while Japanese investments in overseas  stock markets maintained a high level at $80-100 billion  annually from 1986 to 1988, and "Japan money" had great  influence in the international financial market, this has  declined rapidly since investments peaked at $120 billion in  1989. According to Finance Ministry statistics, investments in  overseas stocks from January to November 1993 amounted to only  $35.9 billion, or less than one-third of the volume during the  peak period. Not only has financial speculation through  overseas stock investments decreased since the bursting of the  bubble economy, life insurance companies and other institutional  investors have also taken a more cautious attitude toward  foreign stock market investments involving exchange rate risks  with the progressive appreciation of the yen, and the decline in  latent profits from domestic stockholdings.    The Japanese private sector, which used to be the leading  player in international stock investments, now avoids the risks  involved in such investments due to the prolonged economic  recession. The private sector in the United States, which has  overtaken Japan in economic recovery, now replaces Japan as the  source of capital in the Asian and European markets. Analysts  say that "the second half of the 1980's was the era of Japan  money, while the first half of the 1990's will see the dominance  of American money" (according to the Mitsubishi Bank's  International Capital and Foreign Exchange Division).</p>

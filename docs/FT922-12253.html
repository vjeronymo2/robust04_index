			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / The Queen's Awards 1992 (16): Shift from advertising to a media strategy - Aegis Group ONE OF the more unusual awards this year is to Aegis Group, the holding company for the world's largest group of media buying and planning specialists. Aegis is quoted on the London, Paris and New York stock markets but its more familiar wing for clients is Carat, the operating network and brand name of the company. Given that, on average, 85 per cent of the cost of any advertisement is the space it occupies and the other 15 per cent is its production costs, planning for the best and most cost-effective media space is of considerable importance to both advertisers and advertising agencies. First established in 1979, Aegis has managed to more than double its export earnings over the past three years, at a time when advertising revenue globally has come under considerable pressure. Overseas revenue now accounts for 95 per cent of Aegis' income, mainly via overseas subsidiaries operating under the name Carat. For the financial year 1991 Aegis reported turnover of Pounds 2.109bn (exceeding the Pounds 2bn mark for the first time), and pre-tax profits of Pounds 55.2m. However, Aegis has not been entirely untouched by the general downturn in advertising revenue - the pre-tax profits were 19 per cent below those of the previous year, the first full-year decline since the company went public eight years ago. That fall was partly attributable to a 1 per cent drop in European advertising revenue, the worst performance for a decade. Nevertheless, Aegis is organically growing. It now has more than 50 offices in 18 countries, employing over 1,700 people. It has opened branches in Prague, Budapest, Warsaw and Moscow. Mr Roger Parry, development director, believes that Aegis's award is the first to have been given to an advertising agency or media buying specialist; it is an uncommon award for service companies generally. Mr Peter Scott, chairman of Aegis and Carat's chief executive, says: 'For the past three years the Aegis team have worked hard to build Carat as Europe's leading media planning and buying network  .. Carat is now clearly established as Europe's leader with billings in 1992 estimated at more than Dollars 6bn, giving us a market share of 12 per cent. We like to think of ourselves as a European rather than simply a British company, but we are very honoured to receive the Queen's Export Award and pleased to have the recognition of our success in creating a truly international company.' Aegis started life as WCRS in 1979 as a conventional advertising agency, re-christening itself Aegis in 1990 and gradually weaning itself away from advertising and into media buying and planning. It suffered in the 1987 stock market crash - along with so many other advertising agencies - and its acquisition-led growth slowed. The company was too small to compete with international networks such as Saatchi and Saatchi or WPP and Mr Scott decided to shed its advertising elements and concentrate solely on media strategy; Aegis's advertising operations are due to be phased out by the end of 1995. The move away from 'pure' advertising and into media strategy has so far has proved successful, though it initially attracted some shocked cries from advertising agencies. The European media buying market is at the moment moving towards increasingly concentrated buying through the formation of 'clubs' - separate advertising agencies forming tactical links to purchase large volumes of media space and squeeze discounts from media owners. With such a network already, Aegis is well-placed to compete with such clubs. The future of the group is to some extent dependent on an easing of the recession, though Aegis itself predicts only 2 per cent growth in advertising revenue for 1992. One of the more promising areas is likely to be Carat's sponsorship business, as advertisers turn increasingly towards event sponsorships to make themselves more visible in a world of increasingly fragmented media and expanding advertising clutter.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Dear viewers, we have just received a letter sent by  President Alija Izetbegovic to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.    Dear Mr. Chancellor, I would like to thank you for your  letter and for the efforts you are investing to help  Bosnia-Herzegovina and our people. I am particularly grateful  for the support Germany has lent us in the crucial moments  before the withdrawal of the Serbian artillery from the hills  surrounding Sarajevo. The residents of Sarajevo have lived to  see the end of the two-year nightmare, during which one of every  four citizens has been killed or wounded.    However, the city is still under blockade, and Serbian  artillery withdrawn from around Sarajevo has obviously been  redeployed on other battlefields, which has disturbed the  balance of power on those battlefields. Maglaj and Bihac have  come under heavy attacks, which could result in thousands of  fresh victims and further ethnic cleansing.    I believe that the final elimination of Serbian artillery is  a condition for any serious political negotiations. The current  military imbalance to the advantage of the Serbian side has  turned the peace negotiations into a diktat.    Our hopes for a speedy denouement to the Bosnian crisis are  linked to resolving our misunderstandings with the Croatians.  We signed a cease-fire agreement which is to come into effect  on 25 February. I hope that this time the Croatians will honor  the agreement and withdraw their forces which, according to the  UN secretary general's report, consist of at least 5,000  soldiers of the Army of the Republic of Croatia. The  involvement on the part of Germany and the United States would  probably help Bosnia and Croatia find a solution to this  situation, and to re-establish cooperation in many areas.    Yours sincerely,    Alija Izetbegovic</p>

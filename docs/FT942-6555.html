			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / GPs see country gripped by stress Britain is the grip of a 'stress epidemic', with family doctors often taking over the counselling role of parish priests, according to a report published yesterday. A bleak picture of the country's moral and mental well-being is painted in a survey in the British Medical Association News Review. A survey of 650 general practitioners shows a nation in which old people are increasingly left alone, couples are more likely to see divorce as an answer to marital problems and many young adults find it increasingly difficult to cope. More than 80 per cent of doctors said the number of patients looking for help for stress-related problems had increased significantly over the past 15 years. Nearly half make more psychiatric referrals than in 1979.</p>

			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Regulatory burden on small businesses eased - VAT and capital gains tax This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. REFORMS TO the capital gains tax and value added tax regimes aimed at helping small businesses were a central feature of the Budget. The chancellor also announced changes to the Loan Guarantee Scheme, rules governing tax relief on bad debts and on late payments. Measures were announced to relax the regulatory burden of VAT, particularly on small businesses, raising the thres-holds for VAT registration and for the VAT cash accounting scheme and easing the VAT penalty regime, as well as reforming the corporation tax pay-and-file scheme. The government is also looking at a closer alignment of the base for National Insurance contributions and income tax. The Department of Trade and Industry is to publish a consultation paper on easing the burden of statutory audit requirements as they affect very small companies. Businesses will fill in 10m fewer forms this year because of Customs and Excise single-market changes. Next year, following the move to a November Budget, most employers will have to change tax codings once a year instead of twice. Proposals included reducing premiums charged on the Loan Guarantee Scheme to  1/2 per cent on the whole loan for guarantees on fixed-rate lending and to 1 1/2 per cent on the whole loan for guarantees on variable-rate lending - compared with a current premium of 2 1/2 per cent for both types of loans, although that is charged on the guaranteed portion of the loan and is equivalent to 1 3/4 per cent on the whole loan. The Treasury said: 'The bigger reduction for guarantees on fixed-rate borrowing should make it easier for eligible small businesses to secure fixed-rate loans on reasonable terms. These reductions should take effect in the next month or so. 'The president of the board of trade will also be taking forward with the banks further changes to the scheme to make it more attractive for established businesses, in particular by increasing the maximum size of eligible loan to such businesses from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000, and increasing the proportion guaranteed from 70 per cent to 85 per cent. 'The general loan guarantee scheme currently provides a 70 per cent guarantee on qualifying loans up to a maximum of Pounds 100,000 over periods from two to seven years in return for an annual premium of 2 1/2 per cent of the guaranteed portion of the outstanding loan. In Inner City Task Force areas the scheme provides an 85 per cent guarantee and the annual premium is 2 per cent on the guaranteed portion. 'The premium for guarantees on inner-city loans will also be reduced to  1/2 per cent on the whole loan. 'This further reduction will follow changes announced by the president of the board of trade on December 14 1992 that premiums (charged on the guaranteed portion of the loan) for all guarantees issued under the inner-city variant would be reduced to 1 per cent (equivalent to 0.85 per cent on the whole loan) from April 1 1993 along with other changes to scheme rules aimed primarily at making the scheme more cost-effective and more attractive to inner-city small firms. 'Two capital gains tax changes in the Budget both respond to widespread representations from small businesses: 'No CGT charge will arise when entrepreneurs sell shares in their own company and reinvest in other unquoted trading companies; 'The second relaxes the rules on CGT retirement relief, allowing both employees and directors with as little as a 5 per cent shareholding to benefit. 'There will be additional help for traders suffering the consequences of bad debt and late payments. 'The period after which VAT relief can be obtained on bad debts is reduced from 12 months to six, giving businesses a cashflow benefit of Pounds 150m in 1993-94. 'The eligibility threshold for the VAT cash accounting scheme is raised from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 350,000, and entry to the scheme is made easier. 'A Customs and Excise consultation document about the cash accounting scheme has also been published on Budget day. 'Government departments will now be required to publish details of their payment performance in their Departmental Reports. 'Two other changes to VAT administration will be welcome to small businesses: 'The VAT penalty regime will be reformed. The level of an error in VAT accounting at which a misdeclaration penalty is charged is raised considerably, and Customs and the VAT tribunals are given wide powers of mitigation. 'The threshold above which businesses are required to register for VAT is raised in line with inflation, from Pounds 36,600 to Pounds 37,600.' The chancellor announced a range of other measures aimed at supporting business. The Treasury said: 'There will be no real increases in business rates this year. This measure, which will save businesses Pounds 370m in 1993-94, renews the transitional relief provided last year and will help many small businesses. '10,000 more places will be funded on the Business Start Up scheme in 1993-94, giving a direct boost to small-business creation and a stimulus to self-employment in years to come. 'Measures will be taken to alleviate the problem of surplus ACT, particularly for international companies, which should help keep business cost centres, such as research and development facilities, in the UK, and make the UK a more attractive place for international companies to set up their headquarters. 'This will have consequential benefits for many small suppliers and service businesses. More export credit cover will be made available, and premiums will again be reduced. Many small businesses depend either directly or as sub-contractors on the UK's flourishing export sector, and will benefit from these changes.'</p>

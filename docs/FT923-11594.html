			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Survey of Turkey's South East Anatolian Project (1): A tall order for Turkey - Ankara is seeking to restore the once 'Fertile Crescent' to its former glory. But the success of this ambitious and costly project hinges on whether the country can resolve a water dispute with Iraq and Syria and find a lasting solution to the instability within its Kurdish population, says John Murray Brown, who wrote this survey WHETHER a bold experiment in social engineering, or the profligate use of a scarce resource, the day of reckoning is fast approaching for Turkey's South East Anatolian Project. Guneydogu Anadolu Projesi, or Gap as it is better known, is Turkey's most ambitious public investment, and the largest construction project in the countries bordering the Mediterranean. It comprises a sprawling network of hydro-power plants and irrigation schemes spanning the Euphrates and Tigris rivers along Turkey's borders with Iraq and Syria. Just as the ancients developed this alluvial plain, so Turkey is seeking to harness its potential to restore the once 'Fertile Crescent' to some of its former glory. The Gap is a large undertaking supported at the highest level by a political elite dominated by engineers. The project promises much but it has soured relations with Turkey's two downstream neighbours. A continuing riparian dispute with Syria and Iraq means few western donors are willing to provide credits for the development. Turkey has thus been forced increasingly to rely on its own over-stretched financial resources. Amid renewed budget constraints, the government is engaged in a policy review. Tomorrow, Mr Suleyman Demirel, the prime minister, will celebrate another landmark when turbines come into action for the first time on the large Ataturk Dam on the Euphrates, producing the first kilowatt of electricity from this Dollars 4bn investment. With the Ataturk reservoir almost full, Turkey will soon have to decide whether to press ahead with its irrigation plans, diverting more water from the Euphrates, or first seek to negotiate a permanent water settlement with Iraq and Syria. Ankara would appear to have incentives to seek agreement. Syrian support for Turkey's Kurdish rebels, which is linked to the water issue, is the most important. It was Turkey's decision to push ahead on the Ataturk project in 1983 and this is widely seen in Ankara as the reason Syria started backing the PKK, the Kurdish Workers Party. Signs of a political settlement are appearing. Turkey is participating in the technical meetings on water in Vienna in the context of the Arab Israeli peace talks. Last November, Istanbul was offered as the venue for an international water conference, a plan which was later cancelled over the issue of Israel's presence. Turkey has even floated a plan to redirect two of its rivers, the Ceyhan and Seyhan, which end in the Mediterranean, so as make them flow to its Arab neighbours. If there is to be a comprehensive settlement of the region's problems, Turkey's Gap project seems certain to feature. The Gap was conceived as early as the 1950s - some even say it was Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the country's founder, who dreamt up the scheme. But the need to find a cheaper fuel stock and to reduce the import bill, created by the first oil crisis in the late 1970s, spurred the authorities into action. Today, power generation is just one element of a project embracing irrigation, infrastructure development and social services. Officials put the total cost of the Gap at Dollars 9bn. By the next century, when the irrigation infrastructure and all 21 dams and 19 power plants are in place, the total cost will have reached Dollars 32bn. The narrow objective has been to redress the imbalances of Turkey's poorest region, creating jobs in an area facing endemic unemployment, the country's highest population growth, and the social and economic deprivations associated with an eight-year-old rebel insurgency. The scheme will increase Turkey's irrigated farmland by a third. Power from the dams will double the country's electricity capacity. The Gap spans eight provinces and is envisaged as the economic catalyst for a multitude of ancillary economic activities from seed manufacturing to textile production. The social impact is no less ambitious. Land reform offers a panacea for poor farmers caught in a trap of debt in a region where feudal allegiances still predominate. The advent of new farm technologies promises to drag these backward rural communities into the modern age, raising income levels and introducing mechanisation and the science of modern inputs such as fertiliser and pesticides. By directing public investment to the region, the broader objective is to stem the flow of migrant workers, which has put such a strain on public services in cities such as Istanbul and Izmir. The promise of jobs and a better life is seen as a way to win Kurdish hearts and minds and undermine the popular support of the PKK. The project is far from complete. Target dates have been repeatedly moved back. A senior official suggested the best they could hope for was to build all the dams by 2005, the original year of completion of the whole project. But the Gap has also brought considerable benefits. Turkish construction groups have gained invaluable experience, which is paying dividends in markets further afield. The project has engaged the country's best engineers, scientists and urban planners. The Turks are rightly proud of such achievement. There is none the less a growing need to reconcile some of the project's conflicting aims. In an economy where subsidies have long been seen as a cure for an ailing agriculture, the policy of food support will have to be reviewed in the light of the anticipated surpluses produced by the Gap. Experts are looking at appropriate marketing strategies, keen to stop farmers producing surpluses of crops which are impossible to sell. A debate is being conducted on whether policy should be framed to keep families on the land, or to provide alternative employment in urban areas. Many agronomists predict there will be a consolidation of land holdings as large agribusiness concerns move in on smallholders unable to finance the required new inputs. Such a development would run counter to one of the Gap's social imperatives to help the rural poor. At a time of high inflation and spiralling budget deficits, the main argument continues to centre on the project's cost. Officials calculate it will pay for itself in about six years. However, some other estimates say the Gap accounts for a third of Turkey's 70 per cent inflation rate. The indirect costs have made their mark. The investment incentives and the special levies introduced on luxury goods imports and other items - specifically for the Gap - have served to distort budget calculations further still. Without outside assistance, the financial squeeze will continue to affect the timing. It will have an important effect on some of the policy choices, most immediately the choice of irrigation system which will directly affect the downstream users. Mr Olcay Unver, head of the Gap authority, says that 70 per cent of the irrigation canals will use gravity surface techniques, with the rest using a pressurised hose - either drip or sprinkler. Uncovered surface canals, while less costly, are considered the most extravagant in terms of water use. Moreover, the environmental effect of large-scale gravity irrigation, if not properly managed, could result in dangerously high levels of salt deposits in the soils. Only if Turkey can solicit foreign assistance can new investments be made in the sophisticated technologies needed to conserve the water supplies. That will only happen if Turkey can resolve its water dispute with Iraq and Syria and find a lasting solution to its own Kurdish crisis - a tall order for any government.</p>

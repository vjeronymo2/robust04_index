Travelers from southern Iraq told our correspondent that  al-Basrah and adjacent areas were recently the scene of jihad  operations, which claimed the lives of several of the tyrant's  security and ruling party officials, including a senior party  official in al-Basrah. [passage omitted]    The travelers added that Islamic resistance fighters  hijacked  the car of the regime's interior minister and its driver in  December 1993. Following this daring operation, they released  the driver and asked him to convey a threatening message to the  criminal Interior Minister Watban. [passage omitted]    According to our exclusive news reports, the regime of the  tyrant Saddam has been imposing what looks like a military siege  on Baghdad and its environs. Republican Guard brigades are  deployed in al-Rashidiyah, al-Suwayrah, and along the road to  al-Ramadi.    Our sources add that the regime's organs of oppression have  conducted extensive arrests of innocent citizens since the  beginning of January. Recently, the arrests were conspicuous in  al-Hillah after this city was cordoned-off by Republican Guard  brigades. The arrests were on a scale not seen the suppression  of the eternal Sha'ban [March 1991] uprising.</p>

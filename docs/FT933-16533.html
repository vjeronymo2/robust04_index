			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / US steel contract back in melting pot: Pensions and profits block six-year agreement A MUCH-HERALDED labour agreement by the United Steel Workers Union and one of the largest US steelmakers has come apart during ratification, sending negotiators back to the bargaining table. The contract hit a snag shortly after ratification ballot papers had been sent to the 9,000 USW members covered by the pact. The union and Chicago-based Inland Steel discovered serious differences in the accountancy used to determine pension liabilities and profit-sharing rights. The differences resulted in about Dollars 5m in lost income for union members, union negotiators said. Rather than open the completed ballot papers, which were expected to approve the contract, local union leaders held them for nearly a week at a post office in East Chicago, Indiana, and then burned them on Wednesday. 'We're going to have to send a whole new ballot out,' said Mr Gary Hubbard, a spokesman at the union's national office in Pittsburgh. Inland Steel and the union announced tentative agreement on the unprecedented six-year contract on May 27. The current Inland contract is to expire on July 31. The new pact was to serve as a model for negotiations at LTV, Bethlehem Steel and National Steel, the country's largest integrated steel producers, which also have July 31 contract deadlines. The agreement provided for high levels of co-operation between the union and Inland, with both sides seeing it as a stabilising influence on the industry. The US steel industry has undergone drastic restructuring in the past decade. It is fighting competition from abroad and from more efficient domestic mini-mills with non-union labour. The incident is an embarrassment for the union and a frustration for Inland. 'It is troubling - we're trying to demonstrate a new partnership and power-sharing with this contract,' Mr Hubbard said.</p>

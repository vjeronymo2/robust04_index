			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Japanese brokers losing face and profits: Foreign success in the Tokyo market While the Nikkei's continuing plunge - yesterday it fell through the 16,000 mark - has dragged down the fortunes of Japanese stockbrokers, a small band of foreign securities companies is raking in record returns. Figures circulated in Tokyo this week showed that in the year to March, the Japanese office of Salomon Brothers of the US made more profit than any Japanese broking company except Nomura Securities. Goldman Sachs, another Wall Street house, secured third place in the league table ahead of Daiwa Securities. Morgan Stanley and the securities arm of Societe Generale were not far behind. What particularly annoys Japanese broking company managers is that the successful foreign-owned operations make their money largely from trading their own capital using computer-driven programmes. No need for customers. Nor for Japanese-speaking staff. Nor, indeed, for anyone who knows anything about Japanese companies. Japanese brokers have tried to get into the game but have failed to keep up with the skills of the Wall Street imports. So they must rely on a dwindling flow of orders from investment clients, which is proving insufficient to keep them out of the red. Japanese companies have even tried to persuade the Ministry of Finance to clamp down on arbitrage between the cash market and stock index futures - locking in profits between the cash and futures markets, a technique which gives scope for computer-programmed investment. In the past, Japanese brokerage officials have termed arbitrage trading as a 'malaise' to the stock market. The ministry has tightened the rules but cannot stop the practice altogether for fear of angering the US authorities. The earnings figures could prompt further criticism from Japanese brokers and financial authorities of futures and options trading by foreign brokers. Even as the Nikkei average fell to a six-year low yesterday, Japanese brokers were quick to blame arbitrage trading for the decline. 'The foreigners seem to be realising profits from arbitrage-selling, but profits are not everything,' said Mr Tatsuhiko Kusuzawa, senior managing director at Yamaichi Securities. According to results submitted to the Japanese finance ministry and then leaked, pre-tax profits at the 50 foreign brokers totalled Y49.2bn (Pounds 208.5m), 5.6 times higher than the previous year. Market share for foreign brokers has also seen a steady rise, because of their expertise in options and futures trading. According to brokers' estimates, activity at foreign houses only accounted for 3 per cent of the market in the first half of 1988. Because of the sharp fall in orders for domestic institutions at the Japanese brokers, the figure has risen to 20 per cent. However, the fates of foreign houses were divided among those with expertise in stock futures and options markets, and those relying on client orders. Leading UK houses such as Barclays de Zoete Wedd, SG Warburg and County NatWest were among the 23 foreigners which posted pre-tax losses. County, in an effort to stop further losses, has shifted its focus on the derivatives markets and cut staff. The Americans, on the other hand, have come out on top. Pre-tax profits at Salomon Brothers, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley accounted for 85 per cent of total foreign brokers profits. The figures will increase tensions between foreign and Japanese brokers as profits, even at the Big Four, are falling into the red on the operating level for the first quarter of this fiscal year. However, one UK broker says the reign of the arbitrageurs will not last too long. 'The arbitrage techniques have enabled companies to reap good profits in the past couple of years, but due to the increase in efficiency of the markets, arbitrage possibilities are narrowing.' The demise of arbitrage activity could spell relief to some foreign brokers in Japan as well as the Japanese.

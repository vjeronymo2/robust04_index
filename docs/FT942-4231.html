			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / International Company News: Finnair returns to black for year Finnair, the Finnish state airline, has restored its dividend after returning to the black in its latest financial year. This was in spite of the Finnish recession and a slight fall in passenger numbers. Higher turnover, cost-cutting and lower financing costs helped the airline report a profit after financial items of FM113m (Dollars 20.5m) in the year to March 31, compared with a FM415m deficit the previous year. A FM0.30 per share dividend is proposed. Group turnover was 8 per cent higher at FM5.89bn, with a 17 per cent increase in cargo and mail traffic helping to compensate for a 1.5 per cent drop in passenger numbers. The gross margin doubled to FM582m, or 9.9 per cent of turnover, compared with FM284.9m, or 5.3 per cent, a year earlier. There was an operating profit of FM183m, against a FM105m loss. The airline said it was cautious about prospects in 1994-95, in spite of an upturn in domestic air transport demand after four years of decline. It noted that intensified international competition had caused price cuts. The Finnish government recently said it would seek parliamentary approval for plans to cut state ownership in Finnair to as little as 50.1 per cent from its current 72 per cent.</p>

			<p>920620 FT  20 JUN 92 / Major challenges Tory Euro-sceptics MR JOHN MAJOR last night sought to isolate Conservative opponents of the Maastricht accord with a pledge to use his forthcoming presidency of the European Community to keep Britain 'at the heart of Europe'. Welcoming the endorsement of economic and political union in the Irish referendum, the UK prime minister rejected calls from Tory Euro-sceptics for a renegotiation of the deal. He stressed the gains Britain had secured from Maastricht, saying an attempt to re-open the agreement would cast the government in the role of 'political gazumpers'. Conservative opponents of closer European integration, however, said that disappointment at the Irish result would not deflect their efforts to prevent ratification of the treaty. The rebels argued that Denmark's rejection of the treaty earlier this month could not be 'cancelled out' by its acceptance in Ireland. The anti-federalist European Reform Group has invited leaders of the Danish 'no' campaign to a strategy meeting at Westminster next week aimed at bolstering opposition in the British parliament. Mr Major acknowledged that there was no prospect that the UK government would re-introduce legislation to ratify Maastricht until the Danish government had clarified its position and until after the French referendum. Some ministers are speculating that the British legislation could now be deferred until after the EC's Edinburgh summit in early December. But in terms calculated to confront head-on the critics in his own party Mr Major said: 'If we were now to set aside our word we would not be trusted again. We would lose our influence to determine events.' His speech - designed to detach waverers in the Conservative party from the hard core of Euro-sceptics - stressed that Britain could not exercise authority if it stood on the sidelines. 'I want this country to be at the heart of Europe,' he said. 'Only if we are there can we have real influence. We need that influence to build the Europe we want.' Mr Major signalled that Britain, which takes over the presidency on July 1, would seek to rescue the Maastricht agreement by emphasising that it did not represent the 'federalist closed shop' that many feared. That would be achieved by pressing Britain's agenda for the next few years. It included pushing ahead with enlargement, curbing centralism, exercising control over the powers of the Commission and the creation of a genuine single market.</p>

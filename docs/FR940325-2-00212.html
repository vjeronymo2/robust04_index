			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 30, 1993, after completion of construction, Project No. 1 was sold to an owner-trustee and leased back to the Project No. 1 partnership. In the event the Project No. 1 partnership elects not to extend the lease for the 5 year option period, rent which would otherwise have been paid during the option period, equal to approximately $7 million, will become immediately due and payable. The obligation to pay such rent in the event the lease term is not extended has been guaranteed (``Rent Guarantee'') by Parent No. 2 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  In addition to the Rent Guarantee, in connection with the sale and lease back financing Parent No. 2 has also guaranteed until July 1, 1995 payment of any cost incurred by it that becomes necessary to correct a defect in Project No. 1's steam turbine foundation, up to $2 million (``Foundation Guarantee''), and the payment under certain circumstances of certain state taxes which might be deemed payable in the future in connection with Project No. 1's construction financing (``Tax Guarantee''). In connection with EII's acquisition of the Stock, GPU and EII will enter into an Assumption Agreement under which they would assume Parent No. 2's obligations under the Rent Guarantee, the Foundation Guarantee, and the Tax Guarantee (as well as the Repurchase Guarantee and the Catalyst Guarantee described below) and would agree to indemnify Parent No. 2 against any liabilities arising thereunder. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Except with respect to obligations which may arise under the Rent Guarantee, the Foundation Guarantee and the Tax Guarantee, Project No. 1 partnership obligations under the lease and all other Project No. 1 partnership obligations are non-recourse to Cogen Corp. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project No. 2 is a 102 MW (net) natural gas fired qualifying cogeneration facility located in Florida. Project No. 2 is owned by a Florida limited partnership in which Cogen Corp. holds, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, 50% of the general and limited partnership interests and of which Cogen Corp. is the managing general partner. The other 50% of the general and limited partnership interests are held, indirectly through wholly-owned subsidiaries, by an unaffiliated privately-held diversified industrial corporation (``Investor 2'') which, among other businesses, is engaged in natural gas supply and transportation. Investor 2, through subsidiary companies, provides a portion of project No. 2's gas transportation services and peaking gas requirements and is project No. 2's steam host. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project No. 2 sells its entire net capacity and energy to a Florida electric utility under a long-term power purchase contract and provides steam to a subsidiary of Investor 2 for citrus processing under a long-term steam sales agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Project number 3 (``Project No. 3'') is an 80 MW (net) natural gas fired QF located in New York.

			<p><P> January 23, 1989, Monday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> NEBRASKA RECRUIT VICTOR STACHMUS DIES OF LEUKEMIA  </P> <P> Victor Stachmus, 19, a Nebraska football scholarship winner last year, died  early today at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, where he was being  treated for leukemia, a Nebraska football coach said.  </P> <P> Stachmus, who was from McAlester, Okla., had been hospitalized for two weeks in  the UCLA center for chemotherapy treatments. He had been transferred there from  the M. D. Anderson Medical facility in Houston, where he had been receiving  treatments since September.  </P> <P> "Victor has shown a great amount of courage and was at peace with himself when  he died," Nebraska coach Tom Osborne said. "It was a very tragic situation, but  his spirit was high. It is unfortunate that he never did get to play at  Nebraska, because it was something he really wanted to do."  </P> <P> Stachmus died at 1:30 a.m. PST, according to Nebraska assistant football coach  Ron Brown.  </P> <P> sh First Oklahoman to Sign  </P> <P> Stachmus, who graduated from McAlester High School last spring, was the first  Oklahoma high school recruit to sign a national letter of intent with Nebraska.  He was admitted to St. Francis Hospital in Tulsa, Okla., last April, when it  was discovered he had leukemia.  </P> <P> After a month of hospitalization last spring, doctors said Stachmus' disease  was in remission, and he planned to enroll at Nebraska this semester.  </P> <P> A week ago, Stachmus received more than 1,600 cards and letters from Nebraska  football fans who participated in a "Go Big Vic," campaign to let him know that  Cornhusker fans still thought of him.  </P> <P> "The Stachmus family and the coaching staff at the University of Nebraska would  like to thank all the people for their cards and prayers during Victor's  hospital stay," Osborne said.  </P> <P> "His mother said Victor told her before he passed away that he was spiritually  ready to die and that was a great comfort for the family," said Brown.  </P> <P> "He was a very wonderful young man," said Allen Wadsworth, Stachmus' high  school football coach and McAlester's athletic director.  </P></p>

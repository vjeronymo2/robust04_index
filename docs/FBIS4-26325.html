			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tiffany Bown; embargoed by AFP until 0001 GMT 22 June] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 21 (AFP)--Chinese authorities are  engaged in the systematic persecution of an evangelical  Protestant sect in Henan province, with at least 13 "Shouters"  now in prison, Human Rights Watch/Asia said in a report.    "China: Persecution of a Protestant Sect," published  Wednesday, focuses on an intensive clampdown in the central  province since the group -- an outgrowth of an indigenous  Chinese religious sect founded in 1922 -- was labelled  counterrevolutionary in May 1983.    Large-scale persecution began on May 5, 1983 when some 2,000  Shouters were rounded up nationwide for "re-education," the  international human rights group quoted an unconfirmed account  as saying.    Some 50 Shouters in Henan have since been jailed for up to  15  years, the report said, adding 13 remained in detention while  three had died in prison or on medical parole, the report said.    Since 1990, the authorities have abandoned long sentences in  favour of shorter administrative detention without recourse to  trial, during which sect members are bound, beaten with electric  batons and gagged "if they continue to call on Jesus," it said.    Members are also subjected to other forms of persecution,  including heavy fines and so-called "study sessions," it said.    During the several-day sessions, Shouters are "bound with  rope, forced to stay on their knees for extended periods of  time, physically abused, and forced on pain of torture to  renounce their faith, expose their leaders, and join the  Three-Self Movement," it said.    The Three-Self Patriotic Movement is the officially  sanctioned Protestant Church of China.    The continuing clampdown on the Shouters reflects official  alarm over the rapid growth of the "evangelical, mystical,  subjective, intuitive, apocalyptic and individual" sect, whose  membership at its Lushan base in Henan had grown to 200,000 by  1983, the report said.    Human Rights Watch/Asia said its report "provides further  evidence that the number of known political prisoners and  religious detainees in China is only a fraction of the real  total," noting that only 12 Shouters had ever previously been  listed as having been imprisoned.    It called for the immediate and unconditional release of the  remaining prisoners and "an end to persecution, harassment,  arbitrary arrest and fining of religious practioners who do not  identify with official churches."    The counterrevolutionary label enabled the authorities in  the  1980s to imprison Shouters for long periods while remaining  within the Chinese law, the report said.    But the group -- which stresses Bible study while eschewing  involvement in broader social or political matters -- rejects  the label.    "The Shouters themselves maintained that their differences  with the official church were confined to theological  interpretation and style of worship and were in no way related  to politics or counterrevolution," the report said.    The authorities, which have long sought to prevent the  spread  of unregistered "house churches," object to the Shouters'  evangelical creed, rejection of a professional ministry and  private meetings.    In 1992, officials put the number of Protestants and  Catholics attending state-approved churches at some eight  million, acknowledging the number of "secret" worshippers was  far higher.    The report called on Washington to continue pressing Beijing  to release about 50 religious figures jailed or under house  arrest who were included on a 1993 U.S. list.    China's major trading partners should also push Beijing to  invite the UN Special Rapporteur on Religious Intolerance to  visit China to recommend specific reforms to enhance religious  freedom, it said.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] [Vukovic] There is almost general consensus that  despite the optimism that seemed never to have been greater the  talks in Geneva and Brussels last week yielded "meager results."  Does this assessment also apply to Montenegro's vital need for  the lifting or at least the suspension of the sanctions?    [Lekic] Bearing in mind the diminishing number of  controversial, although complex issues, it is true that  optimistic expectations prevailed, and even possibilities for  the signing of an agreement. In the introductory speech at the  plenary session, Lord Owen said that very little stood in the  way of the agreement. The three sides that actually represent  the three nationalist structures of the authority are more or  less continuing with their maximalist demands for the time  being, lacking the readiness to strike a decisive compromise.  For this reason the pressure of the international community is  at the moment on all three sides. The Muslim side is now  assuming greater responsibly for the rejection of the  Serbian-Croatian agreement, which, formally speaking, reflects  the opinion of the majority in Bosnia-Herzegovina at the moment.  True enough, this is a majority born out of a suspicious  alliance like the earlier Croatian-Muslim alliance that sufficed  for the international community to recognize Bosnia-Herzegovina,  by which the fire in this republic was definitely lit.    However, an agreement of the three sides, a principle that  should have been respected from the very beginning, can be  reached in the coming rounds of the talks. As is known, the  signing of the peace agreement on Bosnia-Herzegovina parallel to  the favorable development of other elements of the peace process  will open a perspective for the progressive suspension, that is  to say, lifting of the sanctions, which gives rise to certain,  naturally, moderate optimism.    [Vukovic] My impression is that certain "sub-questions" are  unexpectedly (in light of the assurances by the state  leadership) getting complicated or perhaps this is merely  becoming evident now. I am primarily thinking of Prevlaka.    [Lekic] A part of the so-called European Union position  paper refers to the demands that the Muslim and also the Serbian  side gain access to the sea. The actual circumstances of these  efforts are hypothetical for the time being.    Throughout the entire course of diplomatic activities,  including this latest one, the position and insistence of our  republic was that Prevlaka belongs to Montenegro. The present  compromise solution for Prevlaka, as perhaps the only  observation of the conclusions of the London conference, has  brought no serious incidents, which was noted with satisfaction  at the last plenary conference. However, a fair and definitive  decision will be reached when Prevlaka formally falls to  Montenegro.    [Vukovic] What about the demand that the blockade of Bar  harbor be lifted to receive humanitarian aid? By the way, to  what degree did the "assistance" of Radovan Karadzic [president  of the Serbian Republic] and [FRY Foreign Minister] Vladislav  Jovanovic help this initiative?    [Lekic] The committee for sanctions at the demand of  incumbent Montenegrin authorities and the FAO [UN Food and  Agriculture Organization] on 11 June 1993 passed a general  decision to open Bar harbor for the humanitarian aid to the  former Yugoslav republics. The renewed operation of this harbor  has been postponed. It is only left to us to analyze why this  decision is not being put into effect and, naturally, to fight  for its alteration.    [Vukovic] Immediately upon their return from Brussels,  [Montenegrin] President Bulatovic said that "in normal times  there would be much less need for Montenegro as well as Serbia  to have independent diplomacy," and that "it is much better that  we strive toward observation of the federal Constitution and  leave this activity to the federal organs." Many understood  this statement as characteristic of the president's laying of  the ground for the abolition of your ministry?    [Lekic] I have no knowledge of preparing the ground for the  abolition of the ministry nor that this issue is topical. I  know that so far the Montenegrin president of the republic and  the prime minister have favored the normal functioning of the  ministry, among other reasons, to adhere to the Constitution.    [Vukovic] Until recently your departure to the post of  ambassador in Rome has been "topical" in the corridors and  lately there has also been some talk that you might take the  post of federal foreign minister. I presume that you have heard  about both options and my question is: Is there any substance  in either of them?    [Lekic] Between Rome and Belgrade I would give priority to  Podgorica, naturally for as long as I enjoy the trust of the  public and the authorities in power. Within my decisionmaking  domain I shall give priority to what I judge to be in the  interest of our republic.    [Vukovic] To sum up -- even when Montenegro's  international status normalizes, is there a reason for  Montenegro to remain without its own diplomacy?    [Lekic] In any form of normalization you speak of there will  be no serious arguments for Montenegro's remaining without its  own diplomacy. On the contrary, valid historic and state  interests exist for the continuation of this important attribute  of Montenegrin statehood.    [Vukovic] The Peoples' Party and the Serbian Radical Party  do not conceal their dissatisfaction with your work and believe  that you are pursuing a "separatist" diplomacy for Montenegro.  Please comment.    [Lekic] I strive for the reputation, the interests, and the  international recognizability of Montenegro by acknowledging  reality, naturally, all this not at others' expense. Those who  do not conceal their dissatisfaction with such efforts at the  same time do not conceal their attitude or intentions toward  Montenegro.    Regarding the Peoples' Party, I would not judge it on the  basis of the statements and moves by some of its  representatives. In other words, I would like to believe that  there are many among its members and sympathizers who respect  Montenegro and its state and henceforth support the state  activities that are in its interest.    [Vukovic] In the Montenegrin opposition block there is also  certain mistrust in you.    [Lekic] Bearing in mind the outlined principles we are  striving for, I have some difficulty in identifying my  antagonism to all the forces that truly and rationally work for  the interests of Montenegro. If you are referring to the  mistrust of those who in the foreign affairs sphere constantly  champion foreign military intervention against the Serbs in  Bosnia and the extension and tightening of sanctions, thus, for  something that does not significantly differ from, for example,  the official views of Turkey, then I would not comment, for, I  hope, wholly rational reasons. In any case, all political  forces perfectly legitimately strive to gain power and personal  aspirations should be treated as normal.    [Vukovic] It seems to me that the so-called Serbian block of  parties in Montenegro is irritated by the manner in which you  conduct the Montenegrin foreign policy, as well as your clear  identification as a Montenegrin in a national sense. Has  somebody from the ruling party (among those who claim that  "Montenegrinhood [crnogorstvo] without Serbianhood [srpstvo]" is  not possible) reproached you for anything in this sense?    [Lekic] I am not aware of anyone reproaching me for anything  like this.    [Vukovic] What is, therefore, your attitude toward  Montenegrinhood with or without Serbianhood, especially in  concrete contemporary political events?    [Lekic] I was always repulsed by the mythologizing of the  intolerant idea of ethnocentrism. I must admit that we perceive  terms like Serbianhood and Montenegrinhood, which otherwise  frequently cause people intellectual and other excitement, as  expressions of romantic rhetoric and old-fashioned pathos. I  have never heard, for example, the terms Englishhood or  Frenchhood although these are big and old nations.    Aspirations of individual political factions that are based  on the past and the attempts to accomplish the mythical and  mystical variant instead of the sober and contemporary option,  give rise to big errors. Political demagogues are transforming  the mythical variant into altogether lowly political goals.  Instead of controversies and mystification of Serbianhood and  Montenegrinhood, the question of the Montenegrin-Serbian state  interests is the one that rationally poses itself. I favor the  search for rational state relations, economic, and cultural  cooperation, by which historic alliances as well as state and  legal peculiarities (of Montenegro and Serbia, two old counties)  would be reinstated at the same time.    [Vukovic] The elections in Serbia are over. The electoral  campaign has shown that literally all the parties there consider  the present Yugoslavia to be a transitional solution on the way  to the final goal -- the alliance of the Serbian lands. Do you  keep to the position you stated in POBJEDA this April that such  an initiative is unacceptable for Montenegro because Montenegro  has an established state and national awareness, and the recent  one in THE INDEPENDENT that Montenegro has its own tradition of  statehood and does not wish to embark upon an adventure by which  it would risk the loss of its own identity? Can you imagine  Montenegro in such a state formation and yourself as the foreign  minister in the republican government, if Montenegro were to  have one at all then?    [Lekic] I can immediately answer that I do not see myself  as foreign minister in such a formation. I would also like to  state my opinion that all peoples have a legitimate right to  self-determination, the Serbs included. I am not familiar with  the concept of such an alliance but I presume that it is  necessary to respect the will of all who are envisaged for such  an alliance.    I did not change my opinion regarding Montenegro as a civic  state and the alliance of the Serbian lands, which I have  clearly explained in POBJEDA and recently in London's THE  INDEPENDENT. In any case the Montenegrin state is not for sale.  I believe that its centennial continuity will continue in the  forms on which the majority of its citizens will decide and  which the minority will democratically respect. Faced with the  new historic challenges and experiences, Montenegro, an old  state, that is to say, the Montenegrin people with recognizable  state and national identity, will know how to chose their  historic ways. In these bleak historic times we are all again  sitting the test of historical maturity and ethics. If we are  worthy of Montenegro and its pure and exalted idea, we will not  make a wrong choice.    [Vukovic] What kind of Montenegro would you by no means wish  to see in the future?    [Lekic] I would not like our political, cultural, and  religious differences transformed into clashes that would later,  depending on the winner, lead into Manichaean division into  heroes and traitors. In this century alone our ancient  divisions have left sorrow and scars on the Montenegrin people,  who live with history, bearing it as a tragic burden.    For this reason it is our duty to reach a political and  cultural consensus regardless of all the differences so that by  collective responsibility we meet the present challenges.</p>

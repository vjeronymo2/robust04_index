			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature] </F>   [Text] President Leonid Kravchuk believes that the problem  of air strikes on positions of Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo should  be considered by the UN Security Council [UNSC].    If there is no other way, measures should be taken. Not only  one or several states, but the entire world community should  decide on this, he told journalists in Kiev Thursday.    The president believes the coincidence of positions of  Ukraine and Russia on the issue is incidental. "I am sure that  our positions will continue to coincide," he said.    Answering questions about the internal political situation  in  Ukraine, including on the republic's federalization, Kravchuk  said that he favored broad economic freedom to all regions of  Ukraine. However, he said: "I believe the question is premature  from a political point of view." At the same time the president  admits that the idea could be expedient in the future.    Asked what political structure for Ukraine - presidential or  parliamentary - would seem preferable for him, Kravchuk said: "I  prefer the political structure of France, where, he said, a  strong parliament co-exists with the president who has large  powers.    Foreign Minister Zlenko told reporters in Madrid that the  NATO decision on air strikes if Bosnian Serbs refuse to lay down  arms may aggravate the situation around Sarajevo and will put  under threat the lives of Ukrainian servicemen who are part of  the UN peacekeeping contingent in the zone.    Defense Minister Vitaliy Radetskyy told journalists in Kiev  Thursday that in case of air raids, the Ukrainian battalion will  be withdrawn to a safer place. He also said that Ukraine does  not intend to give up its preliminary understanding with the  United Nations on tripling its military presence within the  framework of the UN peacekeeping force in the former Yugoslavia.    Late last year the Ukrainian parliament decided to increase  the Ukrainian battalion in Sarajevo from 400 to 1,220 servicemen.</p>

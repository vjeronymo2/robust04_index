			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an accident previously evaluated since the integrity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steam generator tubes after sleeving will be equivalent to that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the original tubes. The sleeve, sleeve joint, and F* joint  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been analyzed and tested for design, operating, and faulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition loadings in accordance with NRC Regulatory [G]uide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.121 safety factors. The potential for a tube rupture is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased with sleeving or F*. At worst case, a tube leak would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occur, resulting in a small primary to secondary leak. Primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to secondary leakage occurring from within the sleeved or F*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> portions of the tube is bounded by the steam generator tube  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rupture scenario evaluated in the Final Safety Analysis Report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the steam generator tube remains capable of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performing its required heat transfer function. Placing a sleeve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the steam generator tube or leaving a tube in service with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defect in a portion of the tube that provides no function results  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a more efficient steam generator than plugging an affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tube. Thus, the consequences of any accident previously  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluated are not increased because the structural integrity and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the heat transfer capability of the steam generators are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly altered by the proposed change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from any accident previously evaluated because both the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structural integrity and the heat transfer capability of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> steam generators will not be significantly affected by the use of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either of the sleeving processes or the implementation of the F*  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criteria. Testing and previous experience indicate that any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> primary to secondary leakage would be well below technical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specification limits. In addition, in the unlikely event the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defective tube failed completely at the defect, the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sleeve end or F* joint would restrain tube movement due to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sleeve end geometry or length of expanded contact within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tubesheet bore. Therefore, there is no threat to adjacent tubes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and no other plant systems will be affected by this change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Thus, there is no potential for a new or different kind of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The heat  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transfer capabilities of Indian Point 2 Steam Generators will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improved by utilizing the proposed sleeving process or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementing the F* criteria rather than the currently required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tube plugging and subsequent loss of heat transfer area. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed change will allow a repaired (sleeved) tube or a tube  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with a tube end defect below the F* distance to remain in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service, rather than completely blocking the tube's flow with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plugs. Because the structural integrity of the tubes will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unaltered, the net effect of implementing the proposed change,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than the currently required plugging procedure, will be an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase in the heat transfer characteristics of the steam  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generator. Westinghouse has done an evaluation of selected LOCA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> [loss-of-coolant accident] and non-LOCA transients to verify that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of sleeves resulting in a plugging equivalency at the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plant limit will not have an adverse affect on the thermal-hydraulic performance of the plant. Therefore, the margin of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety is not reduced. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's analysis and, based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review, it appears that the three standards of 50.92(c) are satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the NRC staff proposes to determine that the amendment request  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involves no significant hazards consideration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Local Public Document Room location: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  White Plains Public Library, 100  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Martine Avenue, White Plains, New York 10610.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Attorney for licensee: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Brent L.

Changes (4) and (5) were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not addressed in the initial proposed no significant hazards consideration (NSH) determination. The licensee's NSH analysis for these two changes was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided in its April 7, 1994, letter to the NRC and is discussed below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As required by 10 CFR 50.91(a), the licensee has provided its analysis of the issue of no significant hazards consideration, which is presented below: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Consumers Power Company finds that activities associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> February 22, 1994 and March 11, 1994 Instrument and Control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Technical Specification change revisions include no significant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazards; and accordingly, a no significant hazards determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in accordance with 10CFR50.92(c) is justified. The following  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary supports the finding that the proposed change would not:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an accident previously evaluated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the deletion of instrument surveillance requirements for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Safety Injection Tank (SIT) instrumentation nor the addition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance of temporarily returning inoperable equipment to service for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance or testing would affect the probability or consequences of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an accident.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SIT instrument channels themselves have no accident function.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Their only purpose is to allow verification that the SITs themselves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are operable.

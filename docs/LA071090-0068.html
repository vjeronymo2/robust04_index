			<p><P> July 10, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLAZE THREATENS THE AVAILABILITY OF SOME KINDS OF GAS  </P> <P> The fire and explosion at the Arco Chemical Co. plant in Channelview, Tex.,  last week is threatening to reduce the availability of some types of gasoline,  industry officials said Monday.  </P> <P> The explosion that killed 17 workers Thursday forced Arco to cease production  there of methyl tertiary butyl ether, or MTBE, a component used to make  lower-emissions and premium gasolines. Arco Chemical is 83% owned by Los  Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co.  </P> <P> Industry sources said Arco Chemical, the nation's largest maker of MTBE, will  be able to supply oil-company customers with only 70% of its contractual MTBE  commitments.  </P> <P> Because there are few alternatives to the Channelview plant's MTBE production,  industry officials fear shortages of certain gasolines.  </P> <P> "(MTBE) was tight before the accident happened, and it's not readily available"  elsewhere, said E. J. (Gene) Bohny, vice president of Texas Petrochemicals  Corp., the second-largest maker of MTBE. "It will be short now."  </P> <P> The fuels most likely to be affected:  </P> <P> * Premium unleaded gasolines that use MTBE to boost octane. Refiners could use  other additives as a substitute, but that could affect costs.  </P> <P> * Gasolines delivered to cities such as Denver and Phoenix that require oxygen  additives such as MTBE in the winter to reduce hydrocarbon air pollutants.  Unocal Corp., which buys MTBE from Arco Chemical to put in gasoline it sells in  Nevada and Arizona, said it will have to reduce the amount of oxygenate in  fuels it delivers to those states.  </P> <P> * Gasolines -- slated for introduction in the next few months -- that use MTBE  to reduce hydrocarbon emissions. Such introductions could be delayed, depending  on the length of the Arco Chemical plant's shutdown.  </P> <P> It is too soon to say how drastic the effects will be. But one thing is  certain: Prices for MTBE, now about $1.10 a gallon, will go up sharply. And  that could affect the wholesale price of products made with it.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Santiago, 26 Apr (EFE) -- Brigadier Major Jorge  Hernan Gimenez, coordinator of the Argentine Air Force chief of  staff, today asserted that the fact that Chile has acquired  Mirage aircraft and Argentina Skyhawk aircraft will not cause a  military imbalance between the two countries.    The high-ranking Argentine Air Force representative said  these purchases "do not represent an imbalance between the two  countries' air forces."    Brigadier Gimenez arrived in Santiago on 25 April to attend  a  series of meeting with the Chilean Air Force general staff and  to visit the National Aeronautical Enterprise (Enaer).    Gimenez told journalists that "we want to tighten our  friendship ties," and explained that the two nations' air forces  are carrying out joint projects and assessing several  cooperation projects for the future.    He also said the individuals responsible for the theft of  plans for the advanced training aircraft IA-63 "Pampa" from the  Argentine Aerospace Equipment Manufacturing Company (FAMA) have  not been identified yet.    He denied that this theft might harm the plan to market this  aircraft, which Argentina hopes to sell to the United States.    The high-ranking Argentine official explained that the U.S.  A-4 Skyhawk fighter bombers will arrive in Argentina in the next  few months.    Gimenez reiterated that both Argentina and Chile maintain a  cordial relationship and are constantly exchanging information,  and dismissed any type of unrest over the acquisition of combat  aircraft by both countries.</p>

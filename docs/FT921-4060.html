			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / Letter: Effect of circulars on share prices need not create inefficient market Sir, Andrew Jack's article on the effect on share prices produced by circulars commenting merely on the rearrangement of accounting information could have carried the argument further. Mr Jack says, the effects in question were dissipated fairly shortly, so there would only be an inefficiency in the market if it were possible to make money by buying or selling after ascertaining that each circular contained no new information (or judgment about the company in question). If money cannot be made (over a reasonable number of cases), or if the return does not compensate for the risks run (essentially betting against the market makers), then there is no inefficiency. But if there is an inefficiency (that is, money can be made at acceptable risk) it does not mean that the efficient market theory is wrong, only that markets are not 100 per cent efficient: the approach of Modern Portfolio Theory is now concentrating largely on the fact that there are inefficiencies to be exploited. Overall, however, the evidence is that markets (at least in larger shares) are highly efficient at allocating capital and that mis-pricing is relatively small. Since the efficient market theory is not intuitive and not accepted in some important places, it is essential to emphasise that this (possible) inefficiency does not upset the present state of this theory. Also if there is this particular inefficiency and it persists, then arbitrageurs will come in and eliminate it, and fairly soon. Anyway, Mr Jack's article has drawn it to their attention.

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / People: Aegis reforms its board Aegis, the group which specialises in buying and planning advertising space, has had a turbulent year. It forced out its highly-paid chairman and chief executive, Peter Scott, in July, and its share price has slid from a peak of 215p in October 1991 to under 30p now. At the time, Scott's departure and the greater influence over the company of its largest shareholder, SFEC, were seen by some analysts as a a 'French coup'. Yesterday, in the aftermath of the Scott upheaval, four new Aegis directors have been appointed. Two relative youngsters joining the board as executives are Bruno Kemoun, 35, and Eryck Rebbouh, 36, both French. Their careers have moved along very similar lines and in the French advertising world they are widely known as 'the twins'; they have been joint managing directors of Carat France since 1990. They are joined by the positively youthful Dominic Shorthouse, who at 30 is a vice-president of Warburg Pincus, the US investment bank and other major shareholder. Shorthouse becomes a non executive director, adding to his London Weekend Television directorship. Ray Kelly, the Richard Branson look-alike chairman and chief executive of Carat UK, one of Aegis' operating companies, has also been appointed an Aegis director. ***** Grupo Financiero Inverlat, Mexico's fourth largest financial institution, has poached one of the City's leading experts on Latin American stock markets to set up its European operation, based in London. ***** Jeremy Campbell-Lamerton, 35, who set up Lazard Brothers' Mexican operation in 1983 and Baring Securities' Latin American equity business in 1990, explains that INVERLAT INTERNATIONAL is waiting for formal approval from the Securities and Futures Authority and expects to open for business at the beginning of 1993. By then, he expects a team of 15 salespeople and analysts to be in place. ***** Christopher Burt, until recently with Pavilion Leisure, has been appointed company secretary of TULLETT &amp; TOKYO FOREX INTERNATIONAL. ***** Andrew Norman-Butler has been appointed a director of Gerrard Vivian Gray, a subsidiary of GERRARD AND NATIONAL. ***** Peter Hollinshead has been promoted to operations director of FORWARD ASSET FINANCE. ***** Angus Griffin, formerly chief general manager, operations, and Simon Featherstone, formerly chief general manager, finance, have been promoted to group commercial director and group finance director, respectively, and have joined the board of NORTH OF ENGLAND BUILDING SOCIETY. ***** Radhika Ajmera and Piedad Fernandez have been appointed directors of ABTRUST FUND MANAGERS; they move from Ivory &amp; Sime. ***** Pascal Boris (below), formerly area manager for North America, has been appointed head of banking at BANQUE PARIBAS London branch.</p>

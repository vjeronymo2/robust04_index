			<p>921020 FT  20 OCT 92 / Arts: Today's Television Taiwan is the subject of BBC2's foreign affairs series Assignment. Brian Barron reports from the island which became the home of those Chinese who opposed Mao Tse Tung and which today boasts the world's largest foreign reserve. The programme accompanies the first delegation of communist Chinese journalists to visit Taiwan and also films the greatest collection of ancient Chinese treasures, taken from the Forbidden City when the Nationalists under Chaing Kai Shek retreated and now kept in tunnels underneath Taiwan's capital. BBC2 also offers Beethoven's Not Dead (9.00), a one-off half-hour comedy adapted from a show first seen at the 1991 Edinburgh Festival with classically trained musicians Miles and Millner. Battlecries, one of the series appearing under the umbrella title 'War And Peace', provides testimony from three Tornado aircrew shot down in the Gulf War (9.30 BBC2). ITV screens the second part of its highly professional documentary series The Kennedys. This episode (10.40) concentrates on John F, showing the part played by father Joe's money in winning the presidency.</p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canadian wheat export record expected CANADA EXPECTS to export a record 37m tonnes of wheat in this crop year, ending July 31, via West and East Coast ports. This would be 1.5m tonnes more than ever moved before, says the Grain Transportation Agency in Winnipeg, and reflects a surge in shipments that began about a year ago. Terminals, railways and ports are operating at full capacity in the west of the country and at near-capacity in the east. Wheat prices have risen sharply and the western farm economy is seeing relief for the first time since the 1987-88 season.</p>

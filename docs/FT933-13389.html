			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Easy ride expected for Ginsburg THE US Senate judiciary committee today begins a week of hearings on the nomination of Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court. But the scene will be very different from the last such confirmation, when millions of television viewers deserted the soap operas for C-Span's engrossing drama of Ms Anita Hill's charges of sexual harassment by nominee Mr Clarence Thomas. Mr Thomas won confirmation and has just completed his second term on the Supreme Court. But both his supporters and his opponents vowed that the lamentable spectacle of his confirmation hearings should not be repeated. For Mrs Ginsburg, at least, that vow is expected to hold: she is expected to win easy and calm confirmation. During the last 12 years of Republican presidents, abortion became the major issue in Supreme Court hearings, with mostly pro-choice Democrats in the Senate majority seeking to undo the pro-life candidates put forward by Mr Ronald Reagan and Mr George Bush. This time, it is barely controversial. Even anti-abortion groups that dislike Mrs Ginsburg's recorded views on the issue have concluded that opposing her would be a waste of their resources. Future candidates can also count on a more discreet airing of personal allegations. Senator Joe Biden, judiciary committee chairman, was much criticised for his handling of Ms Hill's charges against Mr Thomas and has instituted a closed session to round off this week's public hearings. Most of the Clinton administration's confirmation wounds have been self-inflicted. But right-wing opposition groups succeeded in derailing the nomination of Ms Lani Guinier to a Justice Department position and have managed at least to delay hearings on Dr Joycelyn Elders, nominated to be surgeon general, and on Dr Tara O'Toole, picked for a post at the Energy Department.</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Lombard Insurance beats forecast with Pounds 9.14m Lombard Insurance, the recently floated provincial insurance group, comfortably exceeded its prospectus profits forecast for the year to June. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 9.14m, compared with Pounds 8.65m forecast at the time of its May flotation. It has switched its year-end from December to June. In 1993 it made profits of Pounds 5.68m. The shares closed 3p higher yesterday at 181p, compared with the 160p issue price. Despite growing competition for household insurance from direct insurance companies, underwriting profits jumped from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 1.5m in the six months to June. Profits from personal motor insurance also rose strongly, from Pounds 700,000 to Pounds 1.4m. Commercial insurance lines, however, remain the focus for expansion, and there was a Pounds 700,000 profit from underwriting commercial policies in 1994, reversing previous losses. Total gross written premiums were up from Pounds 79.4m to Pounds 93.8m. The company has benefited from declining claims. Continental, Lombard's previous owner, provided Pounds 38.9m to cover any claims for policies written prior to the management buy-out in May 1993. About Pounds 15m of this fund has been utilised, but Mr Andrew Laing, managing director, predicted that a surplus would be available over the next two years. The forecast dividend of 1.58p is to be paid. Pro-forma earnings were 18.1p per share.</p>

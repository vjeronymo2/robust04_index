			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The prime minister, Madame Agathe Uwilingiyamana,  has asked the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of Justice to  carry out an exhaustive investigation into the acts of  insecurity perpetrated in Kigali today, so that those  responsible can be punished in accordance with the laws in  force: Let us listen to her.    [Begin Uwilingiyimana recording] Ladies and gentlemen of  Rwanda, I deplore the insecurity that prevailed in the town of  Kigali today following the violence perpetrated by members of  some political parties that do not want to see the  implementation of the Arusha Accords. These wrongdoers, from  those political parties that do not support the return of peace  in our country, claimed that they aimed to stop a meeting to be  held by the Republican Democratic Movement. This meeting had  been authorized, and the security services had been informed in  order to maintain the security of people and their property. We  sympathize with those harassed and seriously injured persons,  whose number is not yet known. My condolences go to all those  whose family members may have died in these ignominious acts  perpetrated by the enemies of peace. I call upon the services of  the Ministry of Justice and those of the Defense Ministry to  undertake exhaustive investigations into today's events.    Ladies and gentlemen of Rwanda, be patient. Only two days  remain before the establishment of the transitional  institutions, namely the National Transitional Assembly and the  broad-based Transitional Assembly. The date which has been  eagerly awaited by the entire Rwandan people and the entire  international community is 22 February 1994. Thank you. [end  recording]</p>

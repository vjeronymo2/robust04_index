			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Bios of Berlusconi's Three `Wise </F> Men'"]    [Excerpt] (ANSA) Rome, April 28 -- Antonio La Pergola,  Giorgio Crisci and Agostino Gambino are the three "wise men"  that Premier-designate Silvio Berlusconi today named to act as  guarantors that his business interests in no way conflict with  his public office.    La Pergola, who was born in Catania, Sicily, on November 13,  1931, was president of the Constitutional Court from July 2,  1986 to June 14, 1987 and community policies minister in the De  Mita and Goria governments. On March 25, 1994, the outgoing  Ciampi government named him as the 13th judge on the European  Court of Justice. In addition to teaching constitutional law at  the universities of Padua, Bologna and Rome, La Pergola has also  been a member of the Council of Magistrates. In 1989 he was  elected to the European Parliament.    Crisci, born in Rome on January 23, 1923, is a lawyer and  president of the Council of State. He has served as president  of TAR [Regional Administrative Tribunal] in Sicily and as a  juridical advisor and cabinet chief in various ministries. He  is the author of numerous judicial studies.    Gambino was born in Genoa on July 6, 1933 and is a professor  of commercial law at the La Sapienza University of Rome. He has  served on a panel made up of representatives of the government  and the Holy See to oversee relations between the Vatican Bank  (IOR) and the Banco Ambrosiano and on a panel the government  formed in July 1992 to oversee the liquidation of Federconsorzi.

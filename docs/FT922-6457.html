			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A baby boom in a barn - A growing business hidden down a country lane TUCKED away on Nizels Lane, a winding country lane in rural Kent, is a 16th century tithe barn surrounded by cackling geese and two Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs. Three days a week, a discreet signboard is carried down to the entrance of the driveway, the only clue to the bustling business going on behind closed doors. The pastel pink and blue board tells you that the barn is home to Nippers, a novel company selling nursery goods, equipment and toys. Julia Cassell, the founder, began the business in Hildenborough nine years ago with a Pounds 500 investment, and now boasts an annual turnover of Pounds 250,000. Cassell appears to have found the ideal growth industry. 'Baby boomers' are having babies later in life, and have money to spend. Their own parents - the grandparents - also have more disposable income. Research indicates that the baby boomers' baby boom will continue for several years. And, as Cassell says: 'The last thing people want to cut back on is their child.' When Cassell started Nippers in 1983 - a way of working from home part-time while her children were young - she offered only second-hand goods. Pleasantly surprised by the demand, she decided to offer new products. The area's high street retailers were not best pleased. 'I'll close you down if it's the last thing I do,' was the message from one. The local residents were not too thrilled at the idea of suppliers and shoppers trundling down the country lane - and started a petition to stop the enterprise. A further obstacle came from the nursery goods manufacturers, who were not initially interested in Cassell's 'small time' venture. Such challenges made Cassell even more determined. Spurred on by the need to pay her children's school fees, and by a burning desire to prove herself in business - having underachieved at school - she dug in her heels. 'I've chosen an interesting industry,' she says. 'It's a caring, nurturing one - nurturing the mother - but then I've got to get the knife into somebody the other side. It's a constant balance of being both a carer and a business person.' She has never borrowed money; with a high turnaround of stock, Nippers has always been self-financing. She has few overheads: advertising costs, employee wages and a small mortgage taken on when she bought out her brother's share of the farm property they inherited. Her husband, Clive, who runs his own business as a quantity surveyor, helps with Nippers' administration, while brother Michael, an accountant, acts as finance director. They appear to make a good team, combining Cassell's creative flair and energy, her husband's common sense, her brother's expertise. Cassell's marketing approach is simple. Why battle the high streets when you can take a leisurely drive out to the country to the relaxed atmosphere of the barn? The children can play in the playground, the parents can try out the goods at their leisure, and the cost can be significantly lower. Cassell passes on discounts obtained from the manufacturers - for example, buying end-of-line products - and can sell prams Pounds 100 cheaper than high street competitors. Most shoppers spend Pounds 50-Pounds 60 a visit. Nippers is open on three days only, and even then with limited hours for trade - because the premises are in a green belt area. The local authority allows only 14 1/2 hours of business a week. Nevertheless, Cassell says that on a Saturday morning alone the shop can take in as much as a small, local high street shop makes in two to three weeks. She has had to hire two full-time and six part-time employees. 'The recession doesn't seem to have affected us at all,' she says. Cassell is well aware of how a home-run business can take over one's life; she used to work for Relate, as a marriage guidance counsellor. She has two rules: she must have time for her three children and husband, and the business must not affect the family finances. Until two years ago she took no steady income from Nippers, ploughing all the profits back into it, while the family lived off her husband's income. Nippers Hildenborough has matured so successfully that it gave birth last year to Nippers UK Franchising. Cassell, her husband and brother invested Pounds 50,000 in the new venture, aiming to have 70 franchises around Britain in five years' time. The first franchise opened last September, and Cassell has had over 80 inquiries for others since last December. Old barns, granny annexes, stables and even warehouses round the UK could get a new lease of life. Nippers UK Franchising, Mansers, Nizels Lane, Hildenborough, Kent, TN11 8NX.

			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Good second six months helps to cut loss at Arthur Shaw to Pounds 99,000 THE SECOND half at Arthur Shaw, manufacturer of builders' hardware and supplier of engineering products, showed an upturn in all activities, and the group cut its loss from Pounds 410,000 to Pounds 99,000 in the year ended April 4 1993. That was after exceptional charges of Pounds 221,000 (Pounds 113,000), so the group traded at a profit of Pounds 122,000 (loss Pounds 297,000) from turnover of Pounds 16.8m (Pounds 15.7m). The exceptional item included Pounds 175,000 of various costs relating to the extraordinary meeting called by rebel shareholders in February and subsequent management changes. Mr Brian Phillips, the new chairman, said the board had continued with a programme of severe cost cutting and management rationalisation. All divisions had implemented plans to expand sales, improve margins and enter new markets. He was conscious of the current financial position and steps were being taken to reduce borrowings and gearing. Asset disposals were under constant review. The manufacturing division had gained substantial additional business in the window hardware sector through increased market share, new products and improved demand. Losses per share were reduced to 1.58p (3.33p). There is no dividend against an interim of 1.3p.</p>

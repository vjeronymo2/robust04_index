			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Repudiate milk quotas Sir, The current expensive fiasco over milk prices was highlighted by Deborah Hargreaves ('Milk prices sour the cheesemakers', September 19), but the chaos can be placed firmly at the door of former minister of agriculture, Michael Jopling - aided and abetted by the short-sighted empire-building attitudes of both the Dairy Trade Federation and the Milk Marketing Board. At the end of March 1986 Jopling, at half-past-three one morning, after a long tiring session with his European colleagues, agreed that milk quotas would be imposed throughout the European Union only 48 hours later. For reasons never revealed Jopling agreed that the Dutch should be allowed a milk quota equivalent to 757 litres per head of their population, the Irish 1,508, while the British were to be cut back to only 258 litres per head - one third of the Dutch and one-sixth of the Irish. And the Italians? They have never imposed quotas upon their farmers and are now producing 12 per cent more than they did in 1984. We produce 15 per cent less. Out of that basic mistake by Jopling has grown the current position whereby Britain's milk producers are only allowed to produce 80 per cent of the UK's milk requirements - the Irish produce 300 per cent of theirs. The sooner Britain repudiates this grossly unfair quota restriction the better. Anthony Rosen, Feenix Farming, Rosehill, Arford, Headley, Hampshire GU35 8DF</p>

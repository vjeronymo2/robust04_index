			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Maize prices reach limit as crop estimate slashed MAIZE PRICES in Chicago's futures pit soared to the limit of 12 cents a bushel yesterday, and trade was halted after the market digested figures from the US Department of Agriculture that slashed the estimated size of this year's maize harvest to 6.5bn. Traders expect prices to go higher today, when limits are raised to 18 cents per bushel. The USDA's new harvest estimate, released Tuesday, is 30 per cent below last year's record harvest, and nearly 50bn bushels lower than the government's estimate only a month ago. With production estimates for other coarse grains such as oats, sorghum and barley also near historic lows, livestock farmers and food processors are already wondering where they will find sufficient supplies to meet their needs until next year's harvest. Last year, the US consumed 6.4bn bushels of maize and exported another 1.67bn. A 2bn-bushel carryover from last year's harvest had been widely expected to cushion the effects of this year's short harvest. However, Tuesday's revised production estimates have left analysts estimating how high grain prices must go to ration demand. The USDA trimmed its estimate of US maize use and exports, but the supply situation is still tight. 'We're estimating only 881m bushels in ending stocks this year,' said Mr Dick Lowey, president of AgResources, a Chicago consulting firm. 'That's the lowest since 1976, and lower than any drought year we've seen.' Mr Joel Karlin, analyst with Kemper Securities, agreed. 'There is no room for error,' he said, 'There just aren't a lot of reserves.' Soyabean prices also rallied to their allowable limits yesterday, and livestock futures prices at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plunged as traders calculated that farmers would liquidate herds as feed costs escalate. The USDA estimated that US soyabean production at 1.83bn bushels, also a sharp drop from the previous year. Unlike maize, US soyabean stocks were already thin before this year's harvest. Analysts said a worldwide shortage of feed grains will have political repercussions in the US, and would encourage plantings overseas. Although the USDA has already announced a 5 per cent acreage set-aside program for farmers next spring, analysts say the agency will be forced to repeal that directive, and encourage massive plantings to rebuild stocks. Replacing the shortfall in the coarse grains sector will be more difficult, as maize, while the largest crop in the US, is only grown in small amounts in other regions of the world. Analysts said they expected Chicago maize futures prices for December and March delivery to rise above Dollars 3.00 per bushel, which should encourage farmers to sell stocks out of subsidised storage. Soyabean futures prices, currently well below their July highs, would rally above Dollars 7 per bushel, analysts said.</p>

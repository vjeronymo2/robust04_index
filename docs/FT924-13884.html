			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / Survey of Computers and Communications (11): Tackling change head on - Profile of Digital Equipment DIGITAL Equipment is betting its future on open systems. The world's second-biggest computer company - and the first to build its success on the popularity of minicomputers - has declared that open systems are vital to its survival. This is radical stuff, particularly for a company that built its fortunes on 'proprietary' computer designs. However, according to Digital Equipment's new president and chief executive officer Mr Robert Palmer, the company will not make it to the end of the century without these changes. 'Digital is facing a much more competitive environment than it has ever faced before,' he said in his first major speech since taking the top job at Digital. 'Driven by open systems and by breakthroughs in silicon technology, a massive change has been sweeping through our industry. The historically high margins on hardware and the business model upon which Digital was built are no longer sustainable.' Mr Palmer says Digital has had to change totally the way it operates. 'As computer hardware performance skyrockets, open systems and the competitive process are driving down prices and squeezing margins, requiring that we lower our cost of doing business. 'We understand that very clearly. It comes to us in the almost paradoxical messages that we get from our customers. In terms of hardware, customers have never been as empowered to control the market as they are today. 'At the same time, the rapidity of technical change and the difficulty of integrating divergent systems has had an unsettling effect on many customers. 'Some customers are outsourcing - delegating total management of their computers to us. Others are seeking a greater level of advice, support and partnership from us than ever before.' One clear demonstration of this commitment has been the development by Digital of its OpenVMS environment - an 'open systems' variation on the company's popular VMS minicomputer operating system for its VAX range. Critics of OpenVMS might suggest that this is merely Digital's attempt to cash in on the popularity of open systems. But Digital says that it has changed the name of VMS to OpenVMS to reflect its 'product branding' from the X/Open independent open systems group - and that OpenVMS is now the first premier, commercial operating system to achieve such a level of open systems conformance. According to X/Open spokesman Mr Michael Lambert, Digital's work towards more open systems by conforming to the standards set by his consortium will serve it in good stead. 'OpenVMS represents a clear response to user needs and the strongest possible commitment to open systems,' he said. 'Digital is clearly confident that OpenVMS can compete on its merits without the protection of a proprietary lock-in.' In addition, Digital says the OpenVMS environment - along with the OSF/1 (Open Systems Foundation) and Microsoft Windows NT operating systems - form the foundation of Digital's new strategy. Meanwhile, Mr Martin Hingley - a senior technology analyst at International Data Corporation (IDC) - suggests that Digital seems to be taking the right approach by building 'open systems compliance' into both the name and content of VMS. 'Open systems are about a lot more than just Unix,' he says. 'With OpenVMS, Digital's customers no longer need to make choices between 'standards' and the high performance of VAX. Digital also stands to expand its government business in Europe.' Digital has another weapon in its open systems arsenal. Known as Alpha, it is a 64-bit computing architecture designed to give Digital a huge performance edge over the competition. The first implementation of the Alpha architecture is Digital's DECchip 21064 - which it claims is the world's fastest microprocessor, running at clock speeds of 150 to 200 Mhz. The fastest microprocessors typically used in today's personal computer systems only run up to 66 Mhz. Digital says that although its latest systems do not use this much-touted Alpha architecture yet, they have been designed to be 'Alpha-ready'. This should mean that the company's current and prospective customers can 'migrate' in the future from existing systems to more powerful VAX or Alpha-based systems. The final word on these and other plans belongs with new Digital boss Mr Palmer. 'We are committed to the concept of being customer driven,' he promises. 'As our customers demand more, we intend to deliver what they tell us they need. For example, customers are demanding open systems - open systems are driving this market. Digital will therefore do whatever has to be done to be a leader in open systems.' The company, he adds, is also aggressively investing in systems integration and consulting expertise as a part of this drive. 'Digital's systems integration business is growing at more than 20 per cent per year and is profitable. 'It represents an excellent opportunity, exceeding Dollars 2bn in revenue in our fiscal year. We will continue to focus here, and in our multivendor service capabilities. We now service more than 10,000 hardware and software products from 1,300 different vendors. 'And that number is growing. Digital does a better job integrating multiple vendors, hardware and software products than anyone else in the industry, and we will continue to focus on that capability . . . We are committed to expanding our industry-focused applications by substantially growing the number of our software partners.'</p>

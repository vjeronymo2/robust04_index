Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov told the ITAR-TASS  NEWS AGENCY that China carries great weight in Russia's foreign  policy and the two countries enjoy the broadest prospect for  cooperation.    Panov, who is in charge of Asian and Pacific affairs, said  that Russia has speeded up its efforts to develop a "wide  partnership" with China in dealing with both bilateral and  international relations following President Boris Yeltsin's  historic visit to Beijing in December 1992.    The Russian-Chinese relationship should be as normal as one  between two neighbors, the deputy foreign minister said, adding  that the two countries should cooperate for their mutual  interests and for peace in the region and the world as a whole.    He told the ITAR-TASS NEWS AGENCY that Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev will visit China at the end of January.    U.S. President Bill Clinton's coming visit to Moscow and  Kozyrev's trip to Beijing show that Russia is seeking a balanced  diplomatic policy toward the East and West, he said.    Panov also spoke highly of China's economic reforms, saying  that its experiences, especially those obtained in the special  economic zones, will be helpful to Russia.    He said bilateral trade is mutually complementary and would  grow steadily.</p>

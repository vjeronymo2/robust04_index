			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Markets: A year one would rather forget - London The Sun's leaked copy of the Queen's Christmas broadcast has led to some rapid redrafting at Buckingham Palace. The revised speech goes like this: LIKE many other families, we have lived through some difficult days recently. As some of you may have heard me observe, it has indeed been a sombre year. But Christmas is surely the right moment to try to put it behind us and to find a moment to pray for those, wherever they are, who are doing their best in all sorts of ways to make things better. I am thinking especially of people like Mr George Soros, the international investor. At great personal risk, he was able to achieve in September what so many of us have hoped for, so devoutly, for so long: a U-turn in government economic policy. By selling the pound short on a huge scale, he made sterling's continued membership of the ERM impossible. That, in turn, allowed a three-point reduction in interest rates, which has added greatly to the well-being of all of us who have, in our own modest way, some small holdings in the equity market. From the moment that Mr Soros - and his fellow speculators - forced the pound's departure from the ERM, the FT-SE 100 index has risen 20 per cent. In return for his selfless services, he has suffered vulgar intrusions into his private affairs - something, alas, with which I am all too familiar - and has been faced with some difficult decisions about what to do with his Dollars 1bn in speculative profits. He has borne these burdens with fortitude and cheerfulness. Perhaps this shining example of what a human being can achieve will inspire the rest of us. Such talents and indomitable spirit are not given to all of us; but if we can sometimes lift our eyes from our own problems and focus on those of others, it will be at least a step in the right direction. Among those who have been suffering this year, I must single out a few groups for special sympathy. The anguish of investors in property and construction companies is especially great. Last Christmas, you will recall, I asked your prayers for these particular cases of distress, and many of you wrote offering sympathy and best wishes. This year, once again, these unhappy people are mired in misery. Property shares have halved since from their high point in 1989; this year, they fell 20 per cent at a time when the FT-Actuaries All-Share index rose 13 per cent. Construction shares are down 17 per cent over the year. Those of us who - anticipating events just that little bit more alertly - had piled into water stocks, food retailers or banks have shown gains of between 35 and 49 per cent this year. I hope we can find it in our hearts to offer our sympathy and best wishes to those less fortunate than ourselves. Misfortune has also struck some of the outstanding figures of our generation, men like Mr Alan Sugar, Sir Nigel Broackes and Lord Hanson. Mr Sugar failed in his attempt to take Amstrad private at 30p a share; since then, the shares have dropped to 23p. Sir Nigel lost his job at Trafalgar House after a disastrous slide in the share price prompted the Keswick family to buy a minority stake and urge management changes; the shares, which touched 156p in May in the wake of the election, dropped as low as 39p, and are now back at 82p. Lord Hanson pondered buying Canary Wharf from the Reichmanns, then thought better of it; signalled the final abandonment of his ambitions of unbundling ICI; and suffered the misfortune of losing out in the battle for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the baker, to his former protege, Mr Greg Hutchings of Tomkins. Hanson reported its first year-on-year decline in profits; its shares are still below their level of two years ago. For some of us to whom dividends are important it has been - to coin a phrase - an annus horribilis. Companies like Hammerson, Wimpey, Taylor Woodrow, Guardian Royal Exchange, Sedgwick, Pilkington, British Petroleum and British Steel have cut their dividends. Overall, however, dividends have been maintained at a surprisingly high level. The stock market as a whole is yielding 4 1/3 per cent, handsomely ahead of the rate of inflation. The worst misfortunes have, of course, been suffered by those who have lost their homes or their incomes. Some families have been struck with both these misfortunes, though I do not wish to wallow in personal grief. In the first nine months of the year, 100,000 homes were repossessed by mortgage lenders. Unemployment has risen to 2.9m in the course of the year. Some people have retained their jobs, despite all the odds: the chancellor of the exchequer, for example. He embodies the message in those well- known lines: 'Kindness in another's trouble, courage in one's own.' The heroic scale of borrowing on which the Treasury has embarked surely displays both sides of this adage: kindness to gilt-edged market-makers, in reviving a business which seemed headed for extinction only a few years ago; courage in facing up to the barrage of criticisms from City economists, who fear that the markets will choke on such a huge amount of new debt. In this and many other ways, 1993 will certainly bring new challenges. Let us resolve to meet it with fresh hope in our hearts. May every one of you have a happy Christmas. God bless you all.</p>

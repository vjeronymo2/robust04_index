			<p>940718 FT  18 JUL 94 / Two Palestinians shot dead in Gaza rioting The Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement came under severe strain yesterday after at least two Palestinians died when Palestinian and Israeli police exchanged fire as rioting erupted in the Gaza Strip. Israeli troops shot dead the Palestinians and wounded more than 70 at the main Gaza-Israel checkpoint, after thousands of workers waiting to cross into Israel rioted, burnt 40 Israeli buses, set fire to a petrol station and hurled stones. The clashes were the bloodiest since Mr Yassir Arafat, Palestine Liberation Organisation chairman, returned to Gaza this month. Israeli and Palestinian witnesses said Palestinian police and Israeli security forces exchanged fire for the first time since Palestinian self-rule was implemented in Gaza-Jericho. An Israeli soldier and an Israeli border policeman were seriously wounded and at least 15 others hurt. Israel sealed off the Gaza Strip and Lt-Gen Ehud Barak, Israeli army chief, blamed Palestinian police for failing to prevent the riots and for causing some of the casualties. However, Mr Arafat said the Israeli shootings were a violation of the peace accord and called for the immediate deployment of international observers in the Palestinian self-rule areas. It remained unclear last night how the riots started. Palestinians said Israeli checkpoint forces delayed for several hours thousands of migrant workers trying to make the dawn crossing into Israel. Israel said a Palestinian seized an Arab policeman's gun and fired towards the checkpoint, and that Israeli forces fired back in self-defence. The incident has cast a shadow over recent optimism about the success of the peace agreement. Under the accord, Palestinian police are responsible for maintaining law and order over Palestinians in the self-rule areas. Although the rioting may have been provoked by Israeli delays at the checkpoint, the Palestinian police appeared confused and unable to control the mob. Many of the guerrillas-turned-police have had only rudimentary training in crowd control and feel uneasy about putting down Palestinian violence directed against Israel. More seriously, any evidence that Palestinian police deliberately fired their weapons at Israeli security forces would provoke a fierce backlash in Israel against the accord. Israel stopped short yesterday of accusing the police of deliberately firing against Israelis, but Mr Oded Ben-Ami, the prime minister's spokesman, blamed the Palestinian police for most of the casualties and said they had opened fire in every direction, including at Israeli troops.

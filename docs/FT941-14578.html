			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Moscow backpedals in row over Baltic troops The Russian Foreign Ministry yesterday assured western diplomats that remarks by Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, that Russian troops would stay in the Baltics had been reported out of context. However, doubts remain about Mr Kozyrev's - and the Russian government's - intentions. 'This was clearly meant to be some sort of signal,' said a senior western diplomat yesterday. 'But it's not clear what, since the signals vary depending on the part of the government they come from.' Mr Kozyrev, who addressed ambassadors and senior officials of the foreign, defence and interior ministries on Tuesday, had been quoted as saying that Russian troops should remain in the former Soviet republics, including the Baltic states, to avoid a security vacuum and to protect Russian speakers in these states. Reports of his remarks caused protests from the Baltic states. Lithuania said it was strange that such a speech was made immediately after the meeting of the presidents of the US and Russia and at the time when the new Russian parliament opened. Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Bill Clinton signed an understanding on the Baltics, which included a Russian commitment to complete troop withdrawals. Mr Georgy Karasin, the foreign office's chief spokesman, told the Interfax news agency yesterday that he had been using the words 'presence' and 'withdrawal' (of troops) in the 'broadest possible sense'. However, western diplomats believe that the permission to the agencies to report the speech, and the harsher tone taken towards the Baltics, sends a signal to these states and to the world that the attitude continues to harden - especially since the Yeltsin administration sees a need to steal some of the thunder from the patriotic right in parliament.</p>

			<p>941228 FT  28 DEC 94 / UN sees 'progress' in Bosnia UN officials yesterday cited progress in negotiations on the details of a four-month ceasefire in Bosnia. Two Bosnian government soldiers were wounded around Bihac, the embattled Moslem enclave in the northwest. But a temporary truce appeared to be holding. Winter weather also helped slow the fighting. General Sir Michael Rose, UN commander in Bosnia, yesterday met Mr Ejup Ganic, vice-president of the Moslem-Croat federation, to work out the details of the four-month cessation of hostilities, mediated by Mr Jimmy Carter, former US president and due to come into force on January 1. The Moslem-led Bosnian government yesterday disputed UN reports that the truce had taken hold in Bihac, which is ringed by Serb forces from Bosnia and neighbouring Croatia. Mr Ganic called for the withdrawal of the Serb forces from Croatia.</p>

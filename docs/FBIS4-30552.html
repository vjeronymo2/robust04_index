In the last two months, they were visited by anti-Japanese  revolutionary fighters, veterans of the fatherland liberation  war, working people of various social strata and tends of  thousands of students from more than 100 senior middle schools.    Going round the battlefields and historical sites associated  with the history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle of  the Korean people, the visitors get a deeper knowledge of the  glorious and brilliant revolutionary history of the great leader  President Kim Il-song and his undying feats.    In Korea Mt. Paektu area is one of the main centres of  education in the revolutionary traditions.    This area where the Mt. Paektu base was established in the  period of the anti-Japanese revoutionary struggle has secret  camps, secret liaison spots, bivouacs, battlefields including  those of the Pochonbo and Taehongdan battles.    In June 1956, the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il led a  group of excursionists to hew the path of march to the  revolutionary battlefields in Mt. Paektu area and wisely guided  the work of well building up the revolutionary battlefields and  historical sites.    As a result, statues of the great leader, towers and  monuments were erected and revolutionary museums built in Hyesan  City, the starting point of the excursion to Mt. Paektu area,  Pochonbo, Chongbong and Lake Samji and other battlefels and  hstorical sites. And preserved in their original state there are  the historical relics and remains and slogan-bearing trees.    A mauser, binoculars, a field bag, a map and other  historical  relics used by President Kim Il-song in the period of the anti-  Japanese revolutionary struggle are on display in the log cabin  of the headquarters in the Mt. Paektu secret camp. The log  cabin is near Chong-il Peak and Sobaek Stream.    The time-honored old home where dear Comrade Kim Chong-il  was  born preserve valuable historical relics he used in his  childhood, as well as simple household utensils.    On the shore of Lake Samji where the great leader took a  rest  after advancing into the homeland with the main force of the  Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) in May 1939, there is  a grand monument consisting of 6-metre high large group  sculptures portraying members of the KPRA and people of various  strata, 85 in all, and a 50-metre signal-fire tower in a  spacious area 400 metres in length and 250 metres in width with  the statue of President Kim Il-song in the centre.    They are surrounded by the Samjiyon Revolutionary Museum,  the  marker of the historical relics, lodging houses and cultural and  amusement facilities for the excursionists.    The revolutionary battlefields and historical sites in  Pochonbo, Chongbong and Konchang, too, have been built up well  as monuments of eternal value.    The Mt.

			<p><P> March 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 3 KILLED AS CAR SMASHES STALLED TANKER TRUCK;  </P> <P> TRAFFIC: DRIVER OF DISABLED GASOLINE HAULER WAS SETTING OUT HAZARD REFLECTORS.  FOUR PASSENGERS IN THE CAR ARE INJURED, THREE OF THEM CHILDREN.  </P> <P> Three people died and four others -- including three children -- suffered major  injuries when a car smashed into the rear of a gasoline tanker truck stalled on  the shoulder of the Golden State Freeway in Sun Valley, authorities said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> The 9:45 p.m. Monday collision just north of Lankershim Boulevard clogged  northbound traffic until 4:30 a.m. Tuesday, Officer Tami Low of the California  Highway Patrol said.  </P> <P> The driver of the car, a 33-year-old man, and a passenger in the front seat, a  30-year-old woman, died instantly when their 1990 Mazda 626 crashed into the  disabled tanker, Low said. A 28-year-old man who had been riding in the back  seat died about an hour later at Pacifica Hospital of the Valley.  </P> <P> One of the children was seated in the front and two were in the back. All were  injured.  </P> <P> The names of the victims were not released Tuesday, pending notification of  relatives. Low said no one in the car was wearing seat belts.  </P> <P> The occupants of the car, who had been out to dinner at a Lankershim Boulevard  restaurant, appeared to be related, Low said. The four adults in the car were  from Los Angeles and the three children all were from El Monte, she said.  </P> <P> Witnesses said the car drove straight into the parked truck, plowing through  three triangular hazard reflectors and nearly hitting the truck driver, Jessie  Jorquez, 26, of Whittier. Jorquez, who leaped out of the car's path, was  uninjured.  </P> <P> Low declined to give details on what may have caused the crash.  </P> <P> She said investigators also were uncertain whether oil that had leaked from the  truck's engine contributed to the crash.  </P> <P> However, minutes before the fatal crash, Michael McNally, 20, of Sun Valley,  lost control of his car on the oil-slick road and crashed into the center  divider. He pulled to the side of the road to assess the damage to his car and  assist Jorquez.  </P> <P> A 3-year-old boy sitting between the two people who died in the front seat  suffered a fractured skull and a broken leg. He was in critical condition  Tuesday at Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> A 7-year-old boy in the back seat also was taken to Childrens Hospital. He was  in fair condition Tuesday. A 9-year-old boy was in stable condition at Pacifica  Hospital.  </P> <P> A 35-year-old male passenger was taken to County-USC Medical Center but his  condition was not released by hospital officials.  </P> <P> Low said the tanker, which was hauling 8,800 gallons of gasoline to Simi  Valley, had engine problems and pulled to the side of the freeway. Oil from the  truck's engine leaked onto the freeway, but no fuel from the tanker escaped.  </P> <P> Jorquez, who drives for Petroleum Delivery Inc. in Paramount, was setting  hazard reflectors along the roadway when he and McNally saw the car speeding  toward them, said Brad Johansson, president of Petroleum Delivery.  </P> <P> "The car was coming straight toward us. I pushed the guy (Jorquez) out of the  way and jumped myself," McNally said. "It just about hit us."  </P></p>

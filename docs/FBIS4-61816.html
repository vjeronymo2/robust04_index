			<p>BFN     [Text] A declaration of collaboration in developing a  European security system, creating a climate for wider economic  cooperation, and support for the idea of building a Via Baltica  highway -- these are the most important results of the talks  held by President Lech Walesa on the first day of his official  visit to Estonia. Lech Walesa talked to Estonia's President  Lennart Meri, Prime Minister Mart Laar, and Parliamentary  Chairman Ulo Nugis.    The president said that it is ever more clearly visible that  Europe is becoming a united states of Europe. That is why, he  said, we have to create it together.    Referring to the withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia,  on whose territory there are 2,500 servicemen, Lech Walesa  stressed that maintaining troops on foreign territory is not  only inconvenient, but also illogical. However, he noted that  we must show understanding for Russia, which is constantly  withdrawing its soldiers, and for its leaders, who has to  explain this to the Russian public.    In the presence of the presidents of Poland and Estonia, the  two countries' deputy foreign affairs ministers signed an  agreement on avoiding double taxation.    During a meeting with Poles living in Estonia, President  Walesa said he would probably have to stand in the presidential  elections.    Everything indicates that I shall have to stand, said Lech  Walesa, because, as he put it, the job is not yet done and much  work remains to be done in Poland. I feel sorry for Poland, the  president added, and I do not want to waste the achievements of  the last few years.    Poles resident in Estonia told the president about their  problems; about a shortage of text books for learning Polish,  and about difficulties in communication between the two  countries. One of the participants in the meeting, a former  Home Army soldier, recalled Solidarity achievements in the  struggle for an independent Poland and persecution under martial  law. President Lech Walesa said the situation has changed since  then. He added that today Solidarity is first and foremost a  trade union. He emphasized that the split which has taken place  in Solidarity was necessary because a new political stage is  being constructed. Pluralism must reign in Poland, he added.    The president also expressed the hope that his visit would  contribute toward stimulating economic contacts between the two  countries. According to him, so far both countries have not  done enough toward this.</p>

			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / The social role of savings: America Why do many Americans support President Bill Clinton's drive to overhaul the US healthcare system but oppose his other main legislative priority - the North American Free Trade Agreement? The answer is that a guarantee of universal access to healthcare seems to promise greater economic security for many families whereas Nafta is widely (if wrongly) perceived as a threat to jobs and living standards. What the federal government should or should not do to promote economic security in the face of intensified global competition is being hotly debated in Washington. Mr Bill Bradley, the Democratic senator from New Jersey, is urging Mr Clinton to do more than merely improve access to healthcare. To restore the shattered confidence of middle -income families, the US needs to create a broad 'economic security platform'. In addition to universal health cover this would include lifelong access to education and training - to enable displaced workers to relaunch themselves in new careers  -and tough regulation of private pension schemes to end discrimination against workers forced by competitive pressures to switch jobs frequently. Mr Bradley's remarks are timely. The federal government could certainly do more to promote adult educational opportunities and make pensions fully portable. But economic insecurity presents a much broader challenge for governments everywhere: to foster an improved public understanding of an individual's responsibilities in a competitive market economy. With the demise of communism, nearly everybody agrees market capitalism offers a better hope of improved living standards than alternative economic systems. But market forces can work their magic only if people are willing to adapt. No group of workers can be guaranteed indefinite employment at any particular level of wages. A market economy can deliver steadily higher average living standards only if everybody accepts an implicit bargain: changing economic conditions may require them, at some point, to make a temporary sacrifice. It is failure to accept the risks associated with capitalism that creates the rigidities that prevent rapid growth. But why are many people terrified by the pace of change imposed by global market forces? The short answer is they cannot afford to be flexible because they lack a financial cushion to carry them through bad times. People without savings are unlikely to support free markets. Since antiquity, economists have preached the virtues of thrift. But today arguments for higher saving are usually couched in one-dimensional macroeconomic terms. Savings, we are told, will promote investment and hence lead to faster growth. In the long run, this logic is irrefutable: if people do not postpone consumption, capital cannot be accumulated. If capital is not accumulated, an economy cannot expand. But the crucial role of personal savings in helping individuals cope with the vicissitudes of a market economy is too often overlooked. The argument has particular force in the US (and other Anglo-Saxon economies) where rates of personal savings tend to be abysmally low. The best way to reduce people's feelings of insecurity and to increase their commitment to capitalism is to persuade them to save a higher fraction of their income. This will lubricate economic change more effectively than an extension of publicly funded social benefits, which tend to undermine individuals' incentive to accept responsibility for their economic futures. The commitment to thrift in the east Asian 'miracle' economies shows that much higher levels of personal savings are possible even for families on low to medium incomes. The first step western governments should take is to remove fiscal disincentives to saving. The US, which raises only a tiny proportion of national revenue through consumption taxes, is one of the worst offenders in this respect. The US tax code directly penalises saving by taxing nominal, rather than real, interest income and capital gains. And it provides huge subsidies for personal borrowing: mortgage interest of up to Dollars 1m a year is deductible. A more controversial question is whether governments should mandate higher rates of personal savings rather than merely level the fiscal playing field. This is the path now being taken by several developing countries. At first glance, government-imposed savings requirements may seem an unacceptable infringement of personal liberty. But it rather depends on their purpose. Suppose mandated savings were introduced as an alternative to tax-financed welfare. Governments, after all, could abolish most public sector pensions and require everybody to save a sizeable fraction of income through portable private pension schemes. Which would be the greater restraint of liberty: mandated savings obliging people to accumulate wealth and so take responsibility for most of their future needs; or taxes forcing people to finance benefits for others? A social policy that relies on, or demands, increased personal saving is bound to be widely unpopular. It is always more pleasant if somebody else pays. Yet it is necessary both to fuel economic growth and to cope with the economic insecurity that is the counterpart of market dynamism.</p>

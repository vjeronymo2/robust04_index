			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): Computers get a bigger vocabulary Computer systems capable of recognising the spoken word have found uses in a range of telephone-based applications, such as call-answering sys-tems and automated information lines. But these systems, which have to recognise a variety of voices and accents, have a very small vocabulary. This is because speech recognisers usually work by collecting vocabularies and downloading them on to proprietary hardware, which limits the system to the vocabulary on the hardware. Computer &amp; Communications Company, a Cambridge-based business, has developed a vocabulary collection and storage technique which does not use special speech recognition hardware. Its WordCraft software, used with a voice processing system, allows developers to build large vocabulary speech recognition systems that can cope with different voices.

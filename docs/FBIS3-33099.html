			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Rally] </F>   [Text] Havana, 17 Feb (AFP) -- "Foreign Partner Wanted" by  Cuba. Recently, this type of advertisement, which has no ties  to the romantic ones that abound in times of crisis,  proliferates in two new Cuban economic newspapers addressed to  foreign readers. According to the monthly CONTACTOS magazine of  the Cuban Chamber of Commerce and the weekly OPCIONES  periodical, which began being published in Havana in January,  the wanted partner must have funds to invest in the island or a  market abroad where Cuban products can be sold.    The request for partners comes from very diverse as well as  unexpected prospects in a country that continues to declare  itself Communist and that practically eliminated foreign  investment since the victory of the revolution in January 1959.  Such is the case because not only do small- and medium-sized  firms advertise their interest in foreign partners but the most  important government associations, oil refineries, sugar  factories, textile firms, distilleries, and cement factories do  so too. They are organizations that have been partially  paralyzed since the fall of the Soviet Union and the divorce  from Russia.    Cuban authorities have established a list of 132 priority  "investment opportunities," which they are proposing throughout  the world in an effort to attract investors with a certain  amount of incentives, mainly in the fiscal sector. Those  proposals have not prompted great enthusiasm for the Cuban  market of 11 million people up to now. However, they have  prompted interest by certain businessmen, mainly Europeans,  Latin Americans, and Canadians.    According to members of the French National Council  Foundation delegation that visited Cuba recently, there is no  doubt that President Fidel Castro's regime is willing to open  the economic system. Castro met with them for eight hours to  confirm the "irreversible" character of the ongoing economic  reforms. Communist leaders have asserted that "the Cuban  economic opening is not a tactical or circumstantial response  but a realistic strategy to permanently adapt the country to a  new international economic scenario.    Concerned that their bulky foreign debt could prompt  difficulties, mainly with European countries, Cuban leaders have  also asserted that "Cuba is willing to consider flexible  renegotiation of its foreign debt, taking into account the  creditors' interests." Parallel to this, the Castro government  has created the International Commerce Bank and inaugurated an  area for merchandise in transit that has many of the  characteristics of a free zone.    The number of mixed firms is still relatively small -- 112  in January 1994 -- but the number of foreign firms being  established in Cuba -- 505 currently -- is increasingly rapidly.  Out of the 112 mixed firms, 28 are in the tourism sector, which  Cuban authorities present as the "salvation" of the economy and  foreign specialists view as the most promising market in the  entire Caribbean.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on Cuban President Fidel Castro's recent visit to </F> South Africa and Brazil]    [Text] On 9 May, at 1907, Cuban President Fidel Castro  arrived at the Jan Smuts International Airport in Johannesburg  to participate in ANC President Nelson Mandela's inaugural  ceremony on the following day. Commander in Chief Fidel Castro  was honoring an invitation made to him and representatives from  another 188 nations to witness the triumph of the first  multiracial elections, the disappearance of racism, and the  establishment of the first South African Government of national  unity.    Prior to his arrival in South Africa, the Cuban president  and  his delegation made a technical stopover in Accra, Ghana, where  the highest leader of the Cuban Revolution held a friendly  conversation with President Jerry John Rawlings. The two leaders  conversed on many topics, but mostly on the ANC and the triumph  of the electoral process in South Africa.    In Pretoria on the morning of 10 May, mankind witnessed a  political change unprecedented in that nation's history. The  main news agencies of the world broadcast for more than 2  billion television viewers the most relevant historic event for  the public opinion in the course of those 24 hours. Present were  5,000 invited personalities, 140 governmental delegations, 40 of  them represented by heads of state and government. Nelson  Mandela was sworn in for a five-year term. In taking over the  destiny of South Africa, he stated to the world: We are  committed to establishing a true and lasting peace, a society of  which we can feel proud where all South Africans, Blacks and  Whites, can live without fear for each other.    In that context, Fidel Castro dialogued with many heads of  state and distinguished political figures such as Jose Eduardo  dos Santos, Butrus Butrus-Ghali, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Robert  Mugabe, Sam Nujoma, Frederik de Klerk, John Rawlings, Yasir  'Arafat, meeting with a total of 30 personalities.    At the seat of government in Pretoria, on the morning of 11  May, Fidel Castro, the president of Councils of State and of  Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, held official talks with  South African President Nelson Mandela.    [Begin recording] [Mandela, in English with superimposed  translation into Spanish] Thank you very much. (?We need you.)    [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into  English] Please convey my greetings to Mr. De Klerk.    [Mandela, in English with superimposed translation into  Spanish] Thank you very much, I will do that.    [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed translation into  English] We have witnessed the death of apartheid and the birth  of freedom. One of the most beautiful things we saw was the  unity of the South African people from all sectors and all  ethnic backgrounds, and no one can imagine how many were saying  that the process continues to evolve in that direction. [end  recording]    On the morning of 12 May, new South African Foreign Minister  (Alsen Sock) and Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina  officially established diplomatic relations between the two  countries. Hours later, Commander in Chief Fidel Castro made  remarks to the South African Broadcasting Company, one of the  stations with greatest repercussions on the national public  opinion.    [Begin recording] [Castro, in Spanish with superimposed  translation into English] I will say this categorically: These  have been extraordinary impressions. South Africa was for me a  mysterious country and I have found an extraordinary country in  all senses. [end recording]    After concluding his visit to South Africa, Cuban President  Fidel Castro and the delegation that accompanied him made a  brief stop in the Brazilian state of Salvador de Bahia. On his  arrival the commander in chief was met by Bahia Governor Antonio  Inva Say. Fidel also met with former Governor Antonio Carlos  Magalhaes and local authorities.    Prior to his departure, Fidel answered the questions of  Brazilian reporters interested in his visit:    [Begin recording, in Spanish with superimposed translation  into Portuguese] [First unidentified reporter] What is Cuba  doing to break the economic embargo?    [Castro] We are making all kinds of effort. We are working  in  the international sphere, at the United Nations, and in all the  organizations. We promote solidarity. We try whatever is in our  reach. There is a movement against the blockade that is gaining  momentum in the United States. The immense majority of the  countries in the United Nations condemn the blockade. Only two  or three nations support the blockade. Meanwhile, the blockade  has to be fought with deeds. With the efforts for the  development of the country, the financial restructuring, and in  the difficult circumstances, we also had to adapt ourselves to  the collapse of the socialist bloc of the USSR which represented  80 percent of our trade.    The embargo has [words indistinct] our fighting spirit and  resistance. I believe that no other country would have been able  to resist what Cuba has resisted. Cuba resists, and it will  continue to resist. In the long run, we will be worthy of the  victory.    [Second unidentified reporter] In the United States,  presidential candidate Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva called for the  end of the blockade on Cuba. How do you see the position taken  by Lula?    [Castro] I greatly appreciate his position. He has always  held that position, as have many other political leaders.  Generally all the progressive and democratic forces of the world  oppose the blockade and that number continues to grow.    [Second unidentified reporter] What are the expectations for  and what is the new economic plan to be implemented in Cuba?    [Castro] Well, it is not a new economic plan. This new plan  has a series of measures. We are already developing our [words  indistinct] adjusted to the conditions of the world we live in,  which is hegemonized by the United States, without giving up our  ideals, concepts, or the achievements of socialism. We are  trying to adapt our economic work to the reality of the world we  live in. Many are the things that we are doing, without shock  policies and without haste. Just recently, the National Assembly  of the People's Government [ANPP] approved a series of measures  of principles designed to stabilize internal finances, one of  the many problems we are facing.    [Third unidentified reporter] What changes, under these  measures that were approved by the ANPP?    [Castro] Excess currency is reduced. [words indistinct] Cuba  has done many things. I believe that the things Cuba has done  can compete in quality and in democratic spirit with those  things that have been done in many countries around the world.  Because in our country it is not the party that nominates, but  the people. In other words, in our country there are  (?thousands) of parties. Each citizen has the right to nominate  candidates and has the right to elect them. But since we do not  have media multinationals, we cannot make our ideas known.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] What motivated you to make a  second visit to Brazil?    [Castro] Many things. Let us say that it is geography. It is  a big country in the southern hemisphere, at the world  crossroads, a place through which one must pass. That is one  reason. Another reason is that it is a friendly nation. A third  is that it is a hospitable country. Fourth, it is a country we  esteem. Fifth, I feel very happy every time I come here. Sixth,  because relations between Brazil and Cuba improve everyday.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] Why Bahia?    [Castro] Because it is on my way. If I am going to Europe,  for example, I cannot go through the Antarctic. I have to go  direct to Madrid or Paris. It is an ideal stopover from the  geographic point of view. From the friendly point of view, I  know Bahia [words indistinct] We have many friends here who  always receive us with affection.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] Do you have another meeting  when you leave here?    [Castro] Yes, when I leave here I will have a meeting with  Morpheus. [chuckles]    [Fifth unidentified reporter] Will you visit the city?    [Castro] I am in a hurry to return. I have been away from  Cuba for over a week.    [Fourth unidentified reporter] At what time are you leaving?    [Castro] That is a military secret. [laughs] Probably,  tomorrow morning. We must leave either in the morning or in the  evening, depending on the weather. [end recording]    Yesterday afternoon [12 May], the commander in chief arrived  in Havana after a tour that included Barbados, on the occasion  of the first global conference for the sustainable development  of insular states; a technical stop in Ghana; the presence of  Cuba at Nelson Mandela's inaugural ceremony in South Africa; and  a brief stop in Salvador de Bahia.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SUMMER SPLASH II: ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> OUR HOTTEST PICKS FOR A JAM-PACKED SUMMER;  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> Orange County wades into its second hundred years facing a summer that's filled  with a wider range of arts and entertainment activities than ever.  </P> <P> The Calendar staff of the Times Orange County Edition selects highlights among  the hundreds of choices offered at the county's theaters, art museums, outdoor  amphitheaters, concert halls, comedy clubs, movie theaters and elsewhere to  stave off any summer doldrums that might dare to take roost.  </P> <P> While your friendly neighborhood theater dishes up the summer blockbusters,  from "Dick Tracy" to a whole slate of sequels, the two coastal cinemas operated  by Los Angeles-based Landmark Theatres will continue to offer local movie  lovers a chance to step out of the mainstream.  </P> <P> * "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!" by the irrepressible Spanish director Pedro  Almodovar opened Friday at the Port Theatre in Corona del Mar, while the  successful run of the Academy Award-winner "Cinema Paradiso" moved from the  Port to the Balboa Cinema in Newport Beach. Almodovar's latest film made  headlines when it was slapped with an X rating; the distributor elected to  release it unrated.  </P> <P> Bookings for later in the season have yet to be finalized, but cineastes can  probably look for the county premieres of the following:  </P> <P> * "Mama, There's a Man in Your Bed," a French fairy tale about a cleaning woman  who tips the boss of a yogurt company to the intrigues against him. The writer  and director is Coline Serreau, who also created the original French version of  "Three Men and a Baby."  </P> <P> * "Jesus of Montreal," in which a Montreal actor puts on a revisionist play on  the death and resurrection of Christ and sees his life begin to parallel his  art. Director Denys Arcand made a splash in 1986 with "The Decline of the  American Empire."  </P> <P> * "May Fools," director Louis Malle's latest, is a social comedy set in the  south of France that tells the tale of a family brought together by the death  of a grandfather, against the background of the May 1968 general strike.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A list of summer arts and entertainment activities for children will appear in  Wednesday's Calendar.  </P></p>

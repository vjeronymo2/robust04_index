			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / International Company News: Roussel Uclaf and Hoechst in shake-up ROUSSEL Uclaf of France and its parent, Hoechst of Germany, yesterday announced a reorganisation of their pharmaceuticals management and increased specialisation of drugs research within the companies. The moves follow the sale last month of Rhone Poulenc's 35 per cent stake in Roussel Uclaf and represent part of a restructuring plan aimed at increasing efficiency and responding to increasingly competitive markets. Under the terms of the management reorganisation, Mr Ernst-Guenter Afting, head of Hoechst's pharmaceuticals division, will become chairman of Roussel-Uclaf from January 1. In turn, Mr Jean-Pierre Godard, a member of Roussel Uclaf's current management board, is to replace Mr Afting at Hoechst. Both cases represent the first time that foreigners have held the respective posts. 'It is something of a cultural revolution' said Roussel Uclaf, adding that the two companies were implementing a broader exchange of staff. Mr Edouard Sakiz, Roussel Uclaf's current chairman, who will retire at the end of the year, said yesterday that the two companies would gradually reshuffle their drug specialisations. Research into antibiotics, for example, will be centred at Roussel Uclaf, while cardiovascular drugs will be centred under Hoechst's pharmaceuticals division. A spokesman for the group said that the moves were aimed at reducing duplication, but added that both companies would continue their existing fields of research. A broader restructuring of Hoechst and Roussel Uclaf will take place from the beginning of next year. Hoechst will transfer its French pharmaceuticals laboratories and some of its German laboratories to Roussel Uclaf. The shift should effectively equalise the turnover of the pharmaceuticals activities of the two groups.</p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Conference agenda reveals Tory unease THE UNEASE among Tory party activists about the depth of the recession has been confirmed in a series of critical motions tabled for debate at the party conference in October. Senior party officials are, however, drawing comfort from assurances by Lady Thatcher that she has no plans to use the conference to launch a broadside on Mr John Major's approach to the economy and Europe. In spite of her public backing for sharp cuts in interest rates and her fierce opposition to the Maastricht treaty on European union, Lady Thatcher's aides have indicated that she does not intend to embarrass the prime minister. Conservative Central Office has suggested in return that she make a brief appearance on the conference platform to share the applause of the party faithful for April's general election victory. The draft agenda for the Brighton conference, leaked at the weekend, contains several dozen motions from constituency activists which are openly or implicitly critical of the government's handling of the economy and Europe. Most of the economic motions back the government's determination to defeat inflation but many then go on to call for a more sympathetic approach to the plight of small businesses, the housing market and the unemployed. Among the specific demands are calls for more government help for training and an extension of the moratorium on stamp duty. A handful demand that sterling be withdrawn from the European exchange rate mechanism to allow interest rates to be cut sharply. A large proportion of the motions on Europe have a similarly equivocal tone, with support for Mr Major's negotiating stance at Maastricht tinged with the scepticism of the treaty's opponents. A small number suggest outright rejection of European union and back Lady Thatcher's call for a referendum on the treaty. Ministers were voicing confidence yesterday that the critics could be 'handled' by Mr Major.</p>

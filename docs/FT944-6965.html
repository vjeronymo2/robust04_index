			<p>941126 FT  26 NOV 94 / Fashion: Inspirational evenings - Some advice to men on how to be cosmopolitan and flamboyant without being flashy or vulgar Obliged to wear dark suits by day, and the uniform of black tie and dinner jacket for formal evening functions, men are not always practised in the art of ringing the changes where dress is concerned. The modern man has been able to shelter behind the protection of regulation 'kit' for too long, and has excused himself from using his clothes as a means of self-expression. He may fear the freedom that comes when the rule book is thrown away. If a gold-edged invitation arrives for an evening's revelry, but black tie is not obligatory, what is a chap to do? He is going to have to think for himself. If he cannot take refuge in his dinner jacket, wants a change from his office suit and feels jeans and a leather jacket are not quite right, what should he wear? This has long been a problem in country circles, where black tie can look ridiculous in more relaxed settings, but has been overcome in the shires by a touch of the flamboyant and eccentric. A gaudy mix of plaids with rich velvets and silks brings a cosmopolitan male flamboyance to provincial parties that is rarely seen in London. Highland castles stage colourful balls and Gloucestershire manors host parties at which men are decked in vibrant splendour. This Regency flair for male sartorial elegance has survived in rural Britain and looks set to return to the city too. City men should not take fright. Many of the looks on offer may have a distinct touch of the romantic about them, with more than a touch of homage to Byron and Shelley, but the best are thoroughly masculine, using fabrics and accessories that are richly sensual but boldly Gothic. Favourbrook, the gentlemen's outfitters, off London's Jermyn Street, says it is selling more individual evening clothes for men. 'The velvets and brocade jackets and waistcoats we produce have been selling much more lately and not just to a few young snappy dressers,' says proprietor Peter Vayner. From elderly judges to successful young city executives, men in search of a little colour have been updating their evening wardrobes with velvet jackets and elaborate silk moiree waistcoats. At Favourbrook, traditional tailoring is mixed with sumptuous fabrics, both contemporary and period in design, to create menswear that is highly individual - a personal statement rather than a run-of-the-mill uniform. It is this notion of personal statement and a sense of individuality that should be aimed at when choosing men's evening attire - a display of healthy flamboyance. Robin Dutt, Bon Viveur, art critic and style guru, is a great advocate of the flamboyant. And it is with evening wear that he sees a chance for men to let loose. 'All stiff sartorial rules can be broken when it comes to men's eveningwear,' says he, 'but it has to be done with panache, with a certain soignee elegance.' He mourns the sobriety of black tie and urges men to invest in at least one sumptuous evening garment in rich velvet or luxurious silk. Velvet seems to be the fabric of the moment and it comes in many shapes and guises from the traditional smoking jacket to the high collared Nehru. Neck fastenings can be experimental and relaxed with variations on cravat ties or collarless dress shirts with studs, or velvet and satin shirts left casually open beneath layers of brocade waistcoats and velvet jackets. The overall aim is to bring some life and colour to the evening scene, to revive the traditions of old, to learn again to couple fun with a touch of the eccentric and to add a dash of romanticism. However, remember that you must feel comfortable with this new look. So do not choose something so wild that you will feel ill at ease. It must be you. After all you do not want to admire it only in the wardrobe. You could, if you feel your personal style is not too flamboyant, invest in a single waistcoat. If you are feeling more adventurous you could go for a jewel-coloured jacket, a romantic cravat or even a complete velvet or brocade suit. If you are in doubt as to how to put it together take a look at the photographs here and think back to the inspirational sources of the current mood - Byron, Shelley, Beau Brummell, the Duke of Windsor, Indian Maharajahs, Gothic novels, the films Dracula, Frankenstein (although avoid the overly sinister) and Les Liaisons Dangereuse. Places to look: Favourbrook, Piccadilly Arcade, Jermyn Street, London W1 for off-the-peg and made-to-measure one-offs and off-beat tailoring. Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche, New Bond Street, London W1 for fabulous men's brocade suits and 'le smoking' jackets. Harvey Nichols, men's contemporary department, Knightsbridge, London SW1 has a wide modern collection of velvets (look particularly for those by Moschino). Simpsons, Piccadilly, London, W1, for traditional smoking jackets. Paul Smith, (there are nationwide stockists) has modern variations on velvet and satin shirts and suits. Good secondhand shops.</p>

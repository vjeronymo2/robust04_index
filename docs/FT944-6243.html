			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (What It Means For You): Improved terms will enhance friendly societies' policies Friendly societies' policies will become more attractive to savers after May 1995, when the annual amount you can pay into these tax exempt life assurance policies will be raised from Pounds 200 to Pounds 270, Debbie Harrison writes. Existing policies can be changed to allow for the increased premium without any loss of the tax privilege. More significant perhaps, are the improved terms offered when policies are cashed in early. Mr Simon Philip, director of personal finance with chartered accountants Binder Hamlyn, said: 'If the plan is surrendered within seven and a half years, when written as an endowment policy, or within 10 years when written as a whole-life policy, the penalties can be severe. The maximum amount you could receive back was a return of your premiums. You would lose all investment growth.' By the new rules that restriction is removed. Societies are free to offer the best possible surrender terms on their qualifying policies. Higher earners will be relieved that the chancellor has not further restricted their pension contributions and benefits. The 'earnings cap'  - a ceiling on the salary taken into consideration when calculating pension contributions and benefits - has been raised in line with inflation, increasing from Pounds 76,800, for the 1994-95 tax year, to Pounds 78,600 for the 1995-96 tax year. (The cap was frozen for the 1993-94 tax year.) For the 1995-96 tax year the maximum pension for capped earners in company schemes will be Pounds 52,400, while the maximum tax-free cash will be Pounds 117,900. The cap affects personal pensions and company pension schemes set up after the 1989 Budget and members who joined any scheme after June 1 1989. A high earner planning a job change will be caught. He or she may not be capped at present - but leaving an old scheme and entering a new scheme will trigger the earnings cap rules.</p>

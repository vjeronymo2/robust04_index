In contrast,  the media and their comments are inadvertently playing the role  of representative to those political circles which are incapable  of providing an objective and constructive analysis.    These media commentators are under the impression that they  have sensed some kind of difference in approach or even in the  manner between the attitude of the head of state and the  behavior of the government. The premier adds: On the contrary,  I would like to stress in this respect and in a prudent manner  and without ambiguity, that there is firm and complete  coordination in the perception and in the work between the head  of the state and myself. The continuous and determined struggle  of the Algerian state against barbaric terrorism concerns all  state institutions, and the same is true in respect of the  political work aimed at establising a serious dialogue with all  those partners who reject violence and accept the principles of  national unity and the constitutional system. This political  work is the concern of the head of the state and of the  government.    In his statement, the head of government says: The head of  state is the one who advocates the method that leads to the  creation of a structured and effective economy, and to the  management of Algeria's foreign financial obligations. The head  of state also coordinates and leads that effort.    In conclusion, the head of government adds: Indeed, the  political situation is complicated and I therefore urge the  information media and those who formulate public opinion to be  vigilant. We must fight the process of deception used by  terrorism, in addition to other means, to kill and slaughter  Algerians from all segments of society, and eradicate it.    The Algerian state remains strong, united, and determined.  The protection of society and saving Algeria is a sacred  patriotic duty. Matters are clear: The people's rejection and  banishment of terrorism clearly stipulate the unwaivering  condemnation of those who work to create confusion in order to  maintain instability and mix up.</p>

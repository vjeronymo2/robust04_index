			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PORTRAIT OF A MEXICAN MASTER: DOGMATIC, BIZARRE, ACCLAIMED  </P> <P> Mexican artist Jose Luis Cuevas is at work in a studio at Pasadena City College  as about 50 students, a couple of photographers and a television crew watch and  record. Straight-backed, intense, his dancing blue eyes seeing nothing but the  picture taking shape, Cuevas draws a pair of large male heads.  </P> <P> Like most of Cuevas' work, there is only a passing resemblance to observable  reality. The heads seem to take on the qualities of masks, heavy browed and  snout-nosed. One displays a long seam with cross-hatching, like a sutured scar,  the other seems to sprout another face from his ear.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Distinctive Signature  </P> <P> Cuevas, surpassed only by 89-year-old Rufino Tamayo as Mexico's most widely  acclaimed living artist, dabs with ink-soaked cotton, slashes with brush and  grease pencil, then applies the distinctive Cuevas signature. He turns to his  audience, glassy-eyed and disoriented, like a man who has just awakened from a  dream.  </P> <P> "Fantastico," says Bertha, his wife of 28 years, who is sitting to the side.  "In 33 years, this is the first time I've watched him at work. I've seen those  little pencils and brushes, but I never knew what he did with them."  </P> <P> Cuevas, 54, who was putting in a one-week stint as the college's  artist-in-residence, later dismissed his display in the studio as "theatrics."  </P> <P> "The creative act is a private act, like making love," said the artist, a  slight man with a Napoleonic ego who sometimes talks of himself in the third  person. "Drawing in front of television cameras becomes a theatrical  representation, like Cuevas playing the role of Jose Luis Cuevas drawing."  </P> <P> Linda Malm, chairwoman of the college art department, said Cuevas was the first  choice of the department's artists- in-residence committee. "They said, 'He's  the world's best draftsman, and we'd like to get him,' " Malm said. Often  compared to British artist Francis Bacon and American Willem De Kooning for  their dark visions, Cuevas was the recipient of the 1983 World Print Award. His  works hang in the permanent collections of, among others, the Museum of Modern  Art and the Guggenheim Museum in New York, the Musee d'Art Moderne in Paris and  the San Diego Museum of Art.  </P> <P> Despite the artist's dismissal of public creation, his audience of art students  is awed, admiringly hovering about him during a series of Cuevas-related  activities at the school. They study the collection of recent Cuevas prints on  display in the school's gallery, bloated, nightmarish figures with  incongruously animalistic features. They listen reverently to the artist's  flippant attacks on some of his Mexican colleagues. They push programs and  posters into his hands to be autographed, and they ask questions.  </P> <P> "What do you think of Chicano art?" a young woman asks.  </P> <P> "Something extraordinary is happening with the Chicanos," said Cuevas breezily,  basking in the attention of the students. "They've created a nostalgic art that  refers back to something expressed by their parents or their grandparents." So  powerful is this nostalgia, with its references to Pancho Villa and the Virgin  of Guadalupe, that it is sending tendrils across the border toward its source,  Cuevas said.  </P> <P> "We have these artists in Mexico now who are returning to nationalism," he  said. "They have a tremendous influence from Chicanos working in the United  States."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Literary Influences  </P> <P> A young man presses the artist on his well-known literary influences ("Those of  us who draw are close to the art of calligraphy, close to the act of writing,"  Cuevas says). The student wants to know which artists best encompass both art  and literature.  </P> <P> "Besides myself?" snaps Cuevas, who has written six books.  </P> <P> A provocative presence on the Mexican art scene since the early 1950s, the  opinionated Cuevas has crossed swords with the mighty of the Mexican art world,  suffered physical attacks and death threats, touched off brawls and carried on  a passionate love-hate relationship with his native land. But he persists.  </P> <P> "We all live in the middle of an earthquake," said Cuevas, talking in a  deliberate, professorial Spanish, almost as if he were dictating a letter. "I'd  say that in each Mexican artist, there is the heart and mind of a  revolutionary. We all carry Pancho Villa around inside."  </P> <P> Born in a poor section of Mexico City, Cuevas spent his early years living  above a paper factory. "My first recollection is of paper trimmings, scattered  over the floor like fallen streamers and confetti from the paper punches," he  once wrote. "It was always carnival time at my house."  </P> <P> The ready supply of something to draw on, an endless stream of bizarre  characters outside his window and his own ill health (at age 10, he spent a  year in bed with a heart ailment) drove him to art, he said.  </P></p>

			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / Sport: Attractive twins and friendly rivals - Skiing / Arnold Wilson enjoys the charming German resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen Garmisch-Partenkirchen is most confusing. What is the height of the mountain? It seems to vary. And is it in Germany or Austria? The guide book says both. And why do skiers go up to the slopes by train, but down to them by cable-car? And another thing - it seems very silly to call a ski resort Garmisch and Partenkirchen. Which is it? I wish they would make up their minds.' These are not the only touches of Alice in Wunder-Land about Garmisch and its mountain - the Zugspitze - Germany's most famous. For example: when was it first climbed? And by whom? The answer is probably 1820. But there again, it might have been in 1846. Or even 1867. It seems that Josef Naus, a Tyrolean army lieutenant, accompanied by an orderly and a local guide was first to the summit. And yet a guide book says: 'The hiking times stated in Naus's diary, have caused doubts as to whether they ever reached the western summit.' The diary makes interesting reading: '26th August. Overnight in the shepherd's hut . . . Pestered by so many fleas that I had to spend half the night killing them while on watch by the fire. Finally escaped outside. '27th August: 4 am. Left the cursed flea hut. Futile attempt to climb the Zugspitze. Another attempt, which finally succeeded after some narrow escapes and extraordinary exertion. At 3.30 we left our abode (the flea hut again) and at 9 that evening, we arrived in Partenkirchen completely exhausted. The cost? 'The guide to the Zugspitze: 2 Florins, 12 Crowns.' The altitude of the peak Naus is supposed to have climbed is not known, even to this day. Estimates vary from 9,712ft to 9,728ft 6inches. This uncertainty was made more confusing in 1986 when the summit temporarily became a Dreitausender (3,000 metres) during an advertising stunt after a helicopter suspended an artificial cliff over the top of the mountain. The summit is divided between Bavaria and the Tyrol, with cable cars ascending from both sides and a customs post near the top. Skiers must take another cable car down to the main skiing area, known as the Platt, a treeless shelf dotted with T-bars and a variety of runs. There is a route down from the summit for specialists. Recreational skiers are discouraged from trying it. Having counted the number of German cars in the gondola station car park at St Gallenkirch, Austria the other day (about 75 per cent) I am surprised there are any German skiers left in Germany. The ones who stay at home were a good deal better mannered than the two oafs who trampled all over my - and my partner's - skis at Ischgl a day or two later. The attractive twin - and rival - resorts of Garmisch (2289ft) and Partenkirchen (2352ft) were united in 1935, a year before the Winter Olympics there, totally against the wishes of both towns' inhabitants. But now the two names go together like Donner and Blitzen. The Zugspitze and Wetterstein range, which overlooks Garmisch, is limestone formed from fossilised sea animals. I mention this because I have been taken to task by Ken Peter, from Hunstanton, Norfolk for describing the Dolomites as granite. They too are limestone - 'a quite young, sea-deposited rock' says Peter, who learned to ski in the Dolomites 'courtesy of the army, in 1946/47.' He suggests: 'Perhaps you might find time to record the different types of rock you ski over.' All I can tell you, is that on some of the lower slopes they are jagged and make nasty scratches on my skis.

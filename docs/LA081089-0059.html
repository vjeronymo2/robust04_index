			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Yale University's British collection acquisition fund is expected to swell by  some $100 million this fall following two auctions of works owned by art  collector Paul Mellon. Christie's will handle the auction of 42 paintings and  sculptures in New York on Nov. 14, and in London three days later. The  collection includes works by Manet, Degas, Van Gogh and Picasso. Mellon, whose  family fortune was made in banking, started collecting while studying at  Cambridge University. He is now in his 80s. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

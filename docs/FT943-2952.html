			<p>940916 FT  16 SEP 94 / Arts: The RPO plays a different tune - Concert When Charles Mackerras is conducting it is advisable to expect the unexpected. To open the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's London season he paired two choral masterpieces, Mozart's Requiem and Janacek's Glagolitic Mass, but typically neither was performed in the version we usually hear. Even the National Anthem came in an arrangement by Mackerras himself. It says a lot about how things have changed at the RPO that Mackerras's brand of adventurousness has found favour there. Not so long ago years would pass by without it seeming necessary to visit a single concert for anybody interested in what was musically important in London. But now there is a new vital spark: Mackerras as principal guest conductor, the Maryinsky-Kirov link with Valery Gergiev, a dash of new music, and more than a dash of imagination in the programming. The RPO has traditionally been the most popular-minded of the capital's four commercial orchestras and there is every sign that it is keen to widen its appeal further through its involvement with Classic FM radio and a big, mass-market recording project. The question is whether the orchestra can raise its game in the programming of its own concerts and still hold on to this popular audience. For its opening concert of the season on Wednesday it had a well-filled Royal Festival Hall, which was a promising start. How many in the audience noticed that they were hearing a different version of Mozart's Requiem from usual? Probably not many: the Beyer edition makes few major changes from the score as finished by Sussmayr after Mozart's death and this was in any case a lacklustre performance of it - difficult to believe that Mackerras was in charge. The Janacek, however, was another matter. With apparent precision the programme described what was to be performed as 'a reconstruction of the original version', though that begs a few questions when applied to a work put together in various stages. Suffice to say that the reconstruction is even more wildly original than what we usually hear. At the Crucifixion climax of the 'Veruju', where the solo organ bursts out, there was now also extra music for three thunderous timpani, as though the heavens were raining down in fury. All the performers, so somnolent in the Mozart, came urgently to life. This performance did not quite equal the electrifying account of the Mass that Mackerras gave a couple of years ago at the Edinburgh Festival, but the RPO played well for him and the Brighton Festival Chorus has never sounded more decisive. The four soloists were Helen Field, Jean Rigby, Philip Langridge and David Thomas, who almost sounded relieved to be freed from their constraints as a Mozartian quartet. The RPO claims this performance to have been a UK professional premiere, which is a small feather in its cap. Nor will it be the last in the orchestra's 'Choral classics' series: anybody who thinks he knows Verdi's Requiem is in for a big surprise when the RPO plays that next spring.</p>

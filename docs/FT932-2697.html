			<p>930617 FT  17 JUN 93 / International Company News: USAir stock slides following forecast of shortfall for year SHARES in USAir, the US airline in which British Airways holds a minority stake, fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 17 1/8 yesterday after the Arlington-based carrier said that it expects to make an after-tax loss this year. USAir said: 'In addition, based on results of operations for the months of April and May and a projection of June results, the company, which had expected to be profitable in the second quarter, currently anticipates that it will sustain a net loss for the quarter'. USAir stressed the results for both the full year and the second quarter should show an improvement over those recorded in 1992. But it said the shortfall over previous expectations stemmed from sluggish revenue growth - which it blames on the general economic conditions. 'Management has taken a number of steps recently to stimulate traffic and generate increased revenues, including reducing leisure fares in certain short-haul markets, and will be reviewing further measures to enhance revenues and reduce costs,' said Mr Seth Schofield, USAir chairman. USAir managed to make a Dollars 2m operating profit in the first three months of 1993, although its significant interest charges meant that this translated into an after-tax loss of Dollars 61m - down from an underlying Dollars 110.2m deficit in the same period of 1992. Last year, its after-tax loss was Dollars 1.2bn, although the deficit was inflated by a number of extraordinary items. The adjusted operating loss stood at Dollars 166.4m, down from Dollars 219.4m in 1991.</p>

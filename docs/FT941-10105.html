			<p>940211 FT  11 FEB 94 / Dry dams threaten Thai way of life: A monsoon country's most serious water crisis Bangkok and the central plains of Thailand, often flooded during the monsoon rains, are now in the grip of a water shortage so severe that some of the most basic aspects of Thai life - from rice farming to having soapy baths at massage parlours - are likely to be affected before the monsoon returns in June. Seen from the pumping station north of Bangkok where the Metropolitan Waterworks Authority draws off the capital's water supply down a 30km canal, the Chao Phraya river appears to be flowing serenely towards the sea. Thai officials, however, are far from serene; they are contemplating the possibility that there will not be enough fresh water running downstream to keep the sea water from pushing inland as far as the MWA's canal. The MWA might be forced to suspend pumping, and that could mean water rationing in Bangkok. 'This is a real crisis,' says Mr Sawad Wattanayagorn, director general of the Royal Irrigation Department. 'It's the most serious crisis in the Chao Phraya river basin in history.' During the dry season from November until June, the Chao Phraya is supplied from the Bhumibol and Sirikit dams (named after Thailand's King and Queen) in the north of the country. When full, the two dams combined can hold more than 16bn cubic metres of usable water. They held that quantity only once, in 1975. This time they started the dry season with a record low volume of 2.2bn cu m of available water, a figure that has since dropped to less than 1.7bn cu m; normal dry season demand is about 6bn cu m. Rice farmers, Thailand's biggest water consumers, could be the first victims of the drought. For the second year running, tempted by high rice prices, many of them have ignored government pleas not to grow an extra crop during the dry season. Without good off-season rains, the crops could fail. Usually the government is sympathetic to the demands of the country's many farmers (as voters they form a powerful lobby) but this year there is no irrigation water to spare to save the rice; the priority is to keep salt water out of the Bangkok water network. 'There's not even enough for regular consumption, let alone irrigating the second rice crop,' says Mr Sawad. Tourist hotels and massage parlours could be severely affected if there was water rationing, and some of them have begun to reduce water consumption already. In central Bangkok, the luxury Dusit Thani hotel has started a campaign to educate employees and guests on how to save water; guests will soon be asked whether they want their towels laundered every day. 'If it's true what the government's saying in terms of present water levels, it's pretty scary,' says Mr Mark van Og-trop, hotel manager. 'It hasn't affected us yet, but it will.' Manufacturing industry is likely to emerge relatively unscathed, at least for this year. Most factories pump water from their own wells. Excessive use of groundwater has caused land subsidence in industrial areas, and there are fears further pumping will allow sea water and pollutants to seep into the ground water, but wells have yet to run dry. Higher demand for water and lower rainfall have both contributed to the water crisis in central Thailand over the past few years. The area of land under irrigated rice has increased rapidly since the 1970s. The water is free to farmers and the old-fashioned irrigation system in the central plains is prone to seepage and evaporation. Industrial and urban use of water has also increased. In the north, less water has been flowing into the dams because demand upstream of the barrages has also risen. Farmers and loggers have hacked down the forests which once acted as sponges, absorbing rain during the wet season and releasing it into streams in the dry months. Rainfall seems to have declined during the last decade, and particularly during the last six years, although wide annual and regional variations make it hard to reach firm conclusions. Last year the north had 623mm of rain, half the normal level, says the RID. Many people believe that deforestation has somehow caused the reduction in rainfall, but the contention is hard to prove. 'My guess is that deforestation has had a lot to do with it,' says Mr Scott Christensen, a research fellow at the Thailand Development Research Institute, an independent think-tank; he is studying the management of the country's water resources. Even if the 20m inhabitants of the central plains survive this year's water crisis without too much hardship and it rains on schedule in June, Thailand will still have to decide how to allocate its water resources in the decades to come. One suggestion is that farmers should pay for irrigation water and that urban consumers should pay more for tap water. The RID wants to build more dams, but environmentalists have mounted increasingly effective protests against such projects. 'With the decline in rainfall over the past couple of years it's really come to a crisis point,' says Mr Christensen. 'The short-term economic impact I think is going to be quite modest, but this is a serious long-term problem.'</p>

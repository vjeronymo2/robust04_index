			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Washington correspondent Hayim Shibi] </F>   [Text] "In Washington, we agreed in principle on a meeting  with Rabin," Jordanian Information Minister Jawad al-'Anani said  in a special interview to YEDI'OT AHARONOT, summing up King  Husayn's visit to Washington.    The next move the Clinton administration would very much  like  to see taking place in Washington soon is a Rabin-Husayn-Clinton  meeting on the White House lawn. Such an encounter would also  serve to inform the Syrians that they are running out of time.    Al-'Anani, who is close to the king, willingly replied to  YEDI'OT AHARONOT's questions.    [Al-'Anani] The principle has been agreed on. What is left  now is to find the right date. King Husayn told his hosts that  he would meet with Rabin -- or with any other leader from the  top Israeli Government echelons -- before a peace agreement is  signed. Naturally, we expect progress to be made in issues  pertaining to borders, water, security, and an entire series of  topics that will be discussed later.    [Shibi] Will we see Israeli ministers traveling to Amman to  sign trade agreements in a year's time? Israeli civilians  visiting there? Will you host the international economic  conference?    [Al-'Anani] To begin with, a preparatory conference will be  held in Morocco in November. That will be the dress rehearsal  for the events in Amman. If the debates make quick progress, I  think everything you mentioned will come to pass.    [Shibi] What message of hope can you convey to Israelis  today?    [Al-'Anani] I hope the talks we are about to begin will bear  fruit.    [Shibi] Will there be talks in al-'Aqabah and Elat?    [Al-'Anani] Not necessarily. We have not decided on the  final venue. There are other options, and we are checking them.  The meeting may be held on both sides of the border in the  'Arava, with one negotiating team on the Israeli side and  another on the Jordanian.    [Shibi] Does Jordan accept Peres' formula according to which  Jerusalem will be open in terms of religion but closed in the  political sense?    [Al-'Anani] We have received no detailed Israeli plan, but  we are encouraged by what has been said so far. We will need to  receive a detailed plan, and then we will respond accordingly.    [Shibi] Are you satisfied with the aid you are about to  receive from the Americans?    [Al-'Anani] We have launched a process, and we encountered  great new understanding on the part of the administration. They  now understand Jordan's position, they appreciate our part in  the peace process, and they are willing to support us  accordingly.    [Shibi] What did you get?    [Al-'Anani] We were told to submit our requests, which will  be screened by the authoritative ranks in State and other  departments.    [Shibi] Are you not apprehensive about the Islamic  opposition in Jordan?    [Al-'Anani] Each of us -- both Jordan and Israel -- has its  own public and constituency to deal with. [end al-'Anani]    It has been learned that Husayn asked Clinton for a $700,000  debt write-off. Clinton promised "that the request would be  favorably examined."</p>

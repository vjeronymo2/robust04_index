			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Advance to Pounds 12.7m for Cape Cape, the building products and industrial services group controlled by Charter Consolidated, announced a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 12.7m for the year to March 31. This was in spite of a 6 per cent drop in sales to Pounds 230m. The profits rise was achie-ved against the background of a modestly increasing demand for building products in the UK and continental Europe, the group said. Cape was less optimistic for its industrial businesses, where the outlook in the UK was uncertain. Operating profits in the architectural and building products division rose by 44 per cent to Pounds 9.4m on sales Pounds 200,000 higher at Pounds 71.7m. The return was helped by the elimination of losses in the ceiling business and higher margins for industrial and insulation products. The industrial services division fell by 9 per cent to Pounds 6.1m on sales down 8 per cent to Pounds 159.8m. The proposed final dividend is 8p (7.75p) for a total 2 per cent ahead at 11p (10.75p). Earnings were 15.8p (14.9p).</p>

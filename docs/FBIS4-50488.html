			<p>BFN     [Text] Hangzhou, May 13 (XINHUA) -- The boat fire case that  claimed the lives of 32 people including 24 Taiwan tourists in  east China's Zhejiang Province will be handled according to law,  mainland legal experts said here today.    They point out that the handling of the case will not be  affected by opinions of relevant experts invited by the Straits  Exchange Foundation (SEF).    Mainland legal experts invited by the Association for  Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) told XINHUA today  that the Hangzhou city procuratorial department is delving into  the case that occurred on the Qiandao Lake on March 31. The  case will be handed over to the Hangzhou Intermediate People's  Court after the investigations.    The mainland legal experts had made detailed explanations to  SEF officials and relatives of the Taiwan victims on the case  and on how the case was disclosed by the Hangzhou Public  Security Bureau when they first arrived in Hangzhou, capital of  the province.    He Ting, a legal expert from the criminal case investigation  bureau under the Ministry of Public Security, said that mainland  legal experts had spent half a day briefing the visitors on the  case and the investigations. A 40-minute video program and more  than 100 slides were shown during the briefing.    Later, the SEF officials and the experts invited by SEF were  led to the burnt boat "Hairui" on Qiandao Lake in Chunan County.  They carefully examined the boat and also took a look at the  tools of crime and the snatched goods and money as well as the  region of water where the crime took place.    He noted that detailed briefings have been made to the SEF  officials and the Taiwan experts while the procuratorial  department is still making investigations into the case and the  case is yet to be tried by the court.    Mainland legal experts said that they believe the SEF  officials and Taiwan experts should be satisfied if they start  from the viewpoint of seeking the truth of the case, because  they now know what they wanted to know and have seen what wanted  to see.    They added, however, that if the SEF officials and Taiwan  experts still show doubts about the tools of crime and the  booty, or still deny the conclusion the mainland legal  departments made through profound investigations, then they are  not seeking the truth in a scientific way.    The mainland legal experts said that they have noted that  there were quite a few guesses, presumptions or even rumors  being spread outside China when the case was being investigated.    They said it is understandable that some people had doubts  and misunderstandings on some issues at that time and it is  reasonable that the SEF officials and Taiwan experts may have  reached different conclusions on some minor issues of the case  now, and thus are raising questions on them.    But it will be a vain effort to place obstacles to the  development of relations across the Taiwan Straits through  "politicizing" the boat fire case or fueling "doubts" by  misusing the mainland's sincerity or the materials and details  of the case offered by the mainland, since the facts are now  very clear and evidence conclusive, mainland legal experts  stressed.    The mission of the SEF representatives is thus over, and  they  are expected to leave Hangzhou by plane tomorrow to return to  Taibei [Taipei] via Hong Kong.</p>

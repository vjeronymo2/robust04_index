			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Markets: Facts are not necessarily better than rumours - London AS THE affairs of the royal family drift out of the realm of rumour into that of fact, the financial markets seem to be heading in the opposite direction. Any stock market trader worth his red braces had got hold of a faxed transcript of the purported royal telephone conversation this week. All were instant experts on who said what to whom. Yet no one seemed to know what was really happening to interest rates, to corporate rights issues, or to fiscal policy. Throughout the week all three were the subject of persistent rumours. Base rates were set to fall on Friday, so the gossip went; a large rights issue was due at any moment; the government might - or might not - raise value added tax in the budget, widen the VAT base, cut back on income tax relief. By the end of the week there had been no cut in interest rates, and only one new rights issue, raising Pounds 46m for First National Finance. The outlook for taxes remained shrouded in mystery. The only new fact available was the date of the Budget, March 16. The outlook for interest rates seemed particularly unclear. Although the government had been signalling for some time that an immediate cut in rates was unlikely, traders convinced themselves that one was possible on Friday. They were reinforced in this view by the recent strength of sterling - in the early part of the week it was still healthily above DM 2.50, well above its post-Black Wednesday lows - and by short-term movements in the money markets, where the overnight rate fell to as low as 3 per cent at one point. Friday came and went, however, with base-rates firmly stuck at 7 per cent. That was not the only bad news. Sterling had weakened to below DM 2.50 for the first time since the very first days of the year. Worse, new inflation statistics appeared to limit the government's freedom to make such a cut any time soon. The figures for the retail price index in December, published at Friday lunchtime, contained the expected healthy performance on the headline inflation rate, which fell to 2.6 per cent, the lowest rate since the summer of 1986. The rate the government is watching, however, is the underlying one, calculated by leaving out the drop in mortgage interest payments. This was much less encouraging. It rose 0.1 per cent in December to 3.7 per cent, ominously near the the government's target ceiling of 4 per cent. Not only does this make an immediate cut in short-term interest rates less likely, it also has worrying implications for long-term rates. Investors alarmed at the size of likely public-sector borrowing this year have been pinning their hopes to a Budget which does something to close the gap between what the government takes in and what it spends. One talked-about measure is a higher rate of VAT - or the extension of this tax to more items. A move of either sort, on a scale large enough to be much help to government finances, would be likely to push inflation over its target ceiling in the second half of 1993. Friday's inflation figures help close off this revenue-raising option, making the threat of a steady rise in public debt more real. The gilt market had had an unpleasant reminder of that fact earlier in the week, thanks to Tuesday's announcement of a gilt auction. This long-expected news served to concentrate the worriers' minds, and the yield on the long-term gilt rose to 8.83 per cent, a rise of a quarter of a percentage point in six trading days. By Friday, despite the poor inflation news, gilts had recovered slightly, with the yield on the long gilt finishing the week at 8.77 per cent. Next week's performance will turn on the December public sector borrowing figures, due on Tuesday. Fixed-interest investors will not be the only people watching that number closely. Finance Directors eager to raise cash will be keen to get their rights issues away before the flood of government paper hits the market. Though there have as yet been no unexpected large issues, the market is apprehensive that they are on the way. Two making headlines this week - the Lonrho issue, which closed on Friday, and the FNFC issue announced the same day - were scarcely favourable auguries. As intended, large investors stayed away from the Lonrho issue in droves, leaving the way clear for Dieter Bock, the German property entrepreneur, to become the group's largest shareholder. The FNFC issue of convertible preference shares, a rescue operation, came as the consumer credit company announced a Pounds 32m pre-tax loss for the year. This, at least, was fact rather than rumour. So were some intriguing figures calculated by the London Stock Exchange, and summarised in the chart. They show that a handful of big companies are an important cause of the slide in the FT-SE 100 index from its high of 2861.5 on January 4, 1993 to the 2,765.1 recorded at Friday's close. Nearly half the index's fall is accounted for by the performance of ten big shares. The drop in Glaxo alone accounts for 13 per cent of the index's slide. It has not been a good week for the mighty, all round.</p>

			<p><P> October 8, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SAN FRANCISCO;  </P> <P> PROTESTERS DECRY CUTS IN AIDS FUNDS  </P> <P> About 250 shouting, whistle-blowing protesters marched down the city's main  street to protest a proposed 86% cut in an AIDS emergency relief bill.  </P> <P> "It means essentially no new money for AIDS programs at all, and it's going to  affect people's lives," Robert Lowe, a member of ACT UP, told the crowd.  Carrying banners and signs reading "Silence Death" and "Treatment Life," the  crowd marched from U.N. Plaza near City Hall up Market Street to the Castro  District. Demonstrators rallied at Market and Castro streets. Some protesters  spray-painted slogans and outlines of bodies on the pavement. The protest was  one of several throughout the country.  </P></p>

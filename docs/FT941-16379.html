			<p>940111 FT  11 JAN 94 / Glimmer of hope for Brazil's street children: Angus Foster visits a pioneering project to rehabilitate and educate a deprived generation Good news rarely reaches Brazil's street children who are forced to survive amid constant hardship. Last year's murders of children in Rio de Janeiro highlighted the horrors which occur regularly throughout Brazil. But a project in the country's third largest city, Salvador, has the initial markings of success. From modest beginnings the project is now working with nearly 3,000 of Salvador's estimated 16,000 street children. Most unusually in Brazil, the private sector has become involved and since August about 250 former street children have been found jobs. Set up in 1991, Projeto Axe is named after a Yoruba word which means the positive force or structure underlying life. Following the project's success it has been praised by Unicef Brazil and the Brazilian government, and is now starting to advise other cities about their street children. 'Of course we've had many failures, but this shows the authorities that programmes like this can work,' according to Mr Cesare de Florio la Rocca, the president and driving force behind the project. The majority of Salvador's street children, as elsewhere in Brazil, have families. But they are forced on to the street usually because their parents cannot or will not feed them. Most children return home late at night or at weekends and only a small number have broken ties with their families. On the street, younger children often rely on begging while older children, between 10 and 15, mix work with petty theft. Prostitution and drug abuse are common. In Salvador's busy Praca da Piedade, many children from as young as six years old are already sniffing glue supplied in return for watches and wallets which the children pocket from passing pedestrians. Children wash in the fountain, watch television in a department store and receive hand outs of clothes and food from a nearby church. 'It is the whole structure they need to stay on the street, and they have total freedom too,' according to Lilian, one of Axe's 'street educators.' Axe has five core activities designed to get children off the street. Since most of the children are illiterate, one of the first tasks is to persuade them to return to school. This is a delicate exercise relying on the skills and patience of the street educators, who often have to persuade reluctant parents as well. Under an Axe work education programme, older children work in a recycled paper factory, metal furniture shop or with clothing design. There is also a project to teach children music and sports skills. Children who join the project are given three meals a day, free bus tickets to their place of education or work, and an allowance of about Dollars 45 (Pounds 30.40) a month. Mr de Florio insists this is not a payment. 'It is to help them be able to stop needing to work on the street,' he said. Most of the funding comes from Unicef, the International Labour Organisation, the European Union and Save the Children. Axe is unusual because it has attracted private sector help, especially one of Brazil's largest construction companies, OAS. Mr Carlos Seabra Suarez, executive vice president, heard about Axe from a Brazilian journalist who knew the project was having trouble finding jobs for its children. According to Mr Suarez, involvement with Axe has been positive for the company and links will be strengthened this year. By the end of last year OAS had 45 former street children under evaluation, of which 28 had already been approved for full time work. Most are being trained for jobs like carpenters, electricians and steelworkers. A special centre is now being planned where many more children will be able to gain job training and professional skills. OAS intends to pay the centre's bills of about Dollars 1m a year, even though many of the children will be recruited by other, rival companies. 'It is not just for OAS but all of Bahia state,' Mr Suarez said. Axe has also placed children with the Salvador municipality, Bahia university and other employers. One project underway will open a hotel in the restored centre of Salvador, known as Pelourinho, where former street children will be trained as hotel staff. According to Axe employees and outsiders, the project has succeeded for three main reasons. Probably the most important is its professionalism. All 97 staff are professionally trained and regularly retrained. Several, like Mr de Florio, have worked with children for many years. The project also gives a high degree of independence and freedom to the children. It seeks their agreement rather than trying to force acceptance of discipline and work. Finally, management is decentralised and does not impose on the educational sphere. For the children, it seems to be working. At an end of term Christmas party for Axe children now back in education, one of them recalled: 'When I started I was shouting at my teacher. But I think I've learned some things, thanks be to God'.</p>

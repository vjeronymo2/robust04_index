			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Biotech market growing The European market for goods that depend directly on the application of biotechnology is worth Pounds 30bn a year in sectors ranging from pharmaceuticals and animal health to chemicals and food, according to a survey undertaken by Ernst &amp; Young and funded by the biotech industry. It estimates that 184,000 jobs depend on biotechnology. However, the study found that companies plan to move future investment away from Europe. The US is the favoured location for the future, while Japan and other Asian countries are becoming popular. Companies' reasons for preferring the US include greater public support for biotech investment, a more predictable science-based regulatory structure and better access to skilled staff than in Europe.</p>

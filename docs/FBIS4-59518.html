			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique "No. 18" issued by the Ministry of Defense; </F> place and date not given]    [Excerpt] For the 18th successive day the criminal and  barbaric acts of the forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang have  continued against our people and their armed forces. This is  all part of the dirty war plan announced by the leader of that  gang, the war criminal, the murderer of women, children, and the  elderly; the supreme murderer of the armed forces, the terrorist  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih in his ill-fated 27 April war speech. Our  armed forces continue their heroic resistance in the face of the  forces of treachery and betrayal which moved a huge force and  equipment toward the former border areas and especially towards  Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish.    Our armed forces managed yesterday and today not only to  stop  the advancing forces of the barbarous al-Ahmar gang in the  directions of Qa'tabah, al-Dali', al-Rahidah, and Karish but to  force those forces to retreat and withdraw from their front line  positions after inflicting heavy losses. We do not pride  ourselves over victories or gloat over the losses of others by  talking about the losses since the first and last losers in this  war are the people and particularly the thousands pushed by the  leader of the al-Ahmar gang like a herd of goats to the  destructive slaughterhouse along the former dividing borders.  However, we must commend the rare heroic spirit and the high  morale of our armed and brave forces in al-Dali' and Karish. It  is sufficient to say that an old veteran yesterday succeeded in  destroying six hostile tanks in al-Dali' area.    If this shows anything, it shows the high spirit of morale  of  our armed forces who are inspired by the justice of the cause  they are defending as a sacred cause with regard to the Yemeni  people. This is the cause of dignity and the honor of women  which the adventurous al-Ahmar gang is attempting to trample on  with its tanks. [passage omitted]</p>

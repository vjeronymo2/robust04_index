			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Patten concedes on tests MR John Patten, education secretary, yesterday moved to defuse controversy over this year's compulsory English tests for 14-year-olds in England and Wales. While the tests will go ahead as planned, the results will not be published in school league tables. However, national totals will be compiled, allowing parents to compare their children's performance with the national average. While the move was welcomed by moderate teachers' unions, the two largest unions, the NUT and the NASUWT, said that they would continue balloting members over boycotting the tests. Teachers' unions had claimed that the tests, to be taken for the first time in June, had been inadequately prepared and that material for them had arrived at schools too late. The announcement that the results of the tests would not be included in schools performance tables appeared to have detached the moderate unions from the opposition camp. Mr Peter Smith of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers described the decision as 'statesmanlike'. He said it was evidence that Mr Patten had heeded fears expressed over the tests in a meeting with teachers' unions earlier this week. Mr David Hart of the National Association of Head Teachers said the move met his union's main objection. 'It effectively converts this year's tests into an unpublished national trial,' he said. Mr Patten also published consultation documents setting out the government's plans for this year's performance tables for schools and colleges. The league tables will cover 4,000 state secondary schools and 19,000 primary schools. For the first time they will also cover 2,000 independent schools, and 470 sixth-form and further-education colleges. The tables will include national curriculum test results; GCSE, A-level and AS-level examination results; vocational examination results and truancy rates. In a concession to independent schools, schools will be able to include GCSE exam results taken up to three years before the age of 16. This year, only results in the previous two years could be included which meant that some schools that entered pupils very early for GCSEs appeared to have fewer pupils with five or more passes at grade C and above.</p>

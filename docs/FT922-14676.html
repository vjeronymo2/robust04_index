			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Election 1992: Fairbairn speech sparks row LORD Whitelaw, the former Conservative party chairman, last night cancelled a visit to Scotland in a row over a speech by Tory candidate Sir Nicholas Fairbairn. Speaking in Perth, Sir Nicholas warned that under Labour, Britain would 'become a country of aliens'. He said: 'This country would be swamped with immigrants of every colour and race, and on any excuse of asylum or bogus marriage, or just plain deception.' The MP, defending the Perth and Kinross constituency, also claimed that with the abolition of the Prevention of Terrorism Act under Labour, 'the terrorists of the IRA would come here as invited guests'. In a statement, the Scottish Conservatives said: 'Sir Nicholas Fairbairn's views are his and his alone. The Scottish Conservative party manifesto states clearly that racial discrimination has no part in our society.' Lord Whitelaw also distanced himself from Sir Nicholas's speech and said he was cancelling his planned visit to the constituency today.</p>

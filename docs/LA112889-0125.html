			<p><P> November 28, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: SCIENCE/TECHNOLOGY;  </P> <P> PAGER CAN RECEIVE MESSAGE WITHOUT OPERATOR, FIRM SAYS  </P> <P> A small Irvine company says it has developed a technology for the paging  industry that allows someone to send word messages without the assistance of a  telephone operator.  </P> <P> Synerdata said its "alpha touch" technology is the first product that allows  pager users to send such messages directly by using a push-button phone.  Previously, if someone wanted to send a pager message that included letters  instead of numbers -- for example, "Phone home, Bob" -- they had to relay the  message to an operator, who typed it into a computer keyboard and then sent it  to the correct pager.  </P> <P> The main advantage of the product, Synerdata says, is that it cuts the high  costs of paging by eliminating the operators.  </P> <P> Synerdata President Leo Jednyak said the heart of the product is computer  software that allows the pager to distinguish between numbers and letters  punched into a push-button phone. After the message is punched in, the computer  reads the message back to the sender for confirmation.  </P> <P> Synerdata is a division of CUE Paging Corp. of Irvine, one of the nation's  largest paging companies.  </P></p>

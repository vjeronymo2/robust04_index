			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / International Company News: NZ supermarket chain lifts earnings 8% PROGRESSIVE Enterprises, the New Zealand supermarket chain, has reported net profits before abnormal items of NZDollars 26.5m (USDollars 14.4m) for the 12 months to July 26, in spite of lower than expected retail sales. This result was 8.3 per cent ahead of Progressive's flotation forecast in May, when it was sold by Coles Myer, the Australian retailer. Comparable trading figures are available, however, because Coles Myer retained a number of the former Progressive group's assets, including the K mart retail chain. Mr David Sadler, chairman, said the better than forecast result reflected the benefits of the company's cost reduction programme, and a lower tax charge due to losses from previous years. Total retail sales were 3.6 per cent lower than forecast at NZDollars 1.003bn, largely due to a slow recovery in the Auckland market. Mr Sadler said growth would come from new stores throughout the North Island over the coming months.</p>

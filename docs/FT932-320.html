			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report GOLD slipped around Dollars 3 a troy ounce on the London bullion market as Comex opened and took profits early. Dealers said that the market was pushing lower purely on the back of technical factors, and they did not rule out a rebound. However, the further gold drifted from Dollars 380, then the less likely it would be that option-related buying would come into the market and boost prices. ALUMINIUM continued to be underpinned on the LME by speculation that a big trading operation was being played out ahead of an announcement on production cuts. But no-one could pin down the possible source of such news. London COCOA ended near the day's lows, depressed by both the strength of sterling and a downside correction after the recent climb to a three-month peak. COFFEE was range-bound in both London and New York. London's September contract was stuck between solid support at Dollars 900 and resistance around Dollars 940 a tonne. New York traders said they were continuing to assess news that Latin American producers intended to retain 15 per cent of their production from October 1 in an effort to bolster prices.

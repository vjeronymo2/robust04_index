			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / International Company News: Top two executives quit at TWA Trans World Airlines, the US carrier which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November, last night said it had parted with its top two executives: Mr William Howard, chairman and chief executive, and Mr Glenn Zander, vice-chairman. In a terse statement, TWA said the two had resigned. Mr Zander was said to have left for personal reasons but there was no explanation for Mr Howard's departure. TWA said Mr Howard's place would be taken by Mr Donald Craib, an existing board member who was formerly chairman and chief executive of Allstate Insurance Group. Mr Robin Wilson, vice-chairman and chief operations officer, would retain those positions, the company said. Mr Howard, the 71-year-old former chairman of Piedmont Airlines, was brought into TWA only last July to oversee its transition out of bankruptcy. He said then that he expected to spend the next few years turning the airline around. Late last year there was speculation that a rift had developed between him and Mr Zander. But last month Mr Howard denied the reports, saying Mr Zander 'will play an ever-increasing role for the airline as time progresses'.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / UK Company News: BPB shrugs off price war reports with 73% jump BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard manufacturer, yesterday shrugged off reports that a price war had restarted in Germany by announcing a 73 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 44m to Pounds 76.1m in the six months to September 30. Mr Jean-Pierre Cuny, chief executive, said that prices on average had fallen by 9 per cent in Germany during the previous 12 months. Knauf, the largest German producer, however, had just announced rises of between 10 and 15 per cent in Germany and 6.5 per cent in the UK to take effect early next year. There was every indication that these price rises would stick, said Mr Cuny. He expected prices to rise by about 4 per cent in France. Group profits in the first half, in the absence of further price recovery, had grown strongly on the back of record plasterboard sales as construction markets, particularly for housing, had begun to pick up in many European countries. Group turnover had risen by 9 per cent to Pounds 625m (Pounds 574.3m). Earnings per share rose from 6p to 10.4p with an increased interim dividend of 3.1p (2.8p). Operating profits rose by 49 per cent to Pounds 76.6m (Pounds 51.3m), while a much reduced interest bill of Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 11.8m) further enhanced the pre-tax rise. Mr Cuny said operating profits were significantly higher in the UK and France, while German profits were also higher because of increased sales, particularly in eastern Germany, underpinned by high demand for housing. Mr Cuny said plasterboard profits in Canada and South Africa had also risen sharply. The two regions regions account for about 18 per cent of BPB sales. Elsewhere paper and packaging improved from a Pounds 0.3m loss to Pounds 6.8m profits due to sharply reduced restructuring costs, which offset a 49 per cent average rise in waste paper prices. Operating profits would have fallen by 4 per cent if reorganisation costs were excluded. A strong cash flow meant that group net borrowings fell to Pounds 116m (Pounds 141.2m at March 31), reducing gearing from 29.6 per cent to 15.5 per cent since September 1993. COMMENT A 2p rise in BPB's share price to 295p on a day when the market fell sharply reflects well on the group. The economic tide is now moving in its favour in most of its markets promising further sales increases. BPB, provided the price skirmish in Germany is ended and does not spill over into other markets, should enjoy further increases in plasterboard operating margins already approaching 13 per cent. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 160m puts the group on a prospective PE of 13 1/2 this year reducing to 11 the following year on profits of Pounds 205m; still good value.</p>

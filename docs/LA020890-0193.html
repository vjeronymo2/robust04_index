			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DODGERS' GOTT SAYS HE HAS GOT IT BACK AFTER WORKING OUT  </P> <P> Jim Gott, claiming that he feels more hunger than pain, pitched at the Dodgers'  workout in Dodger Stadium Wednesday and pronounced himself "80% to 85%"  recovered from last season's elbow surgery.  </P> <P> "I feel absolutely no pain, it is unbelievable," said Gott, one of the new  Dodger relievers, after a 12-minute session that is standard for pitchers.  </P> <P> "I'm ready to be in a spring training game right now. More than anything, I'm  hungry to pitch again, and to show the Dodgers what I can do."  </P> <P> Gott has not thrown in competition since last April, when he injured his right  elbow in the season's second game while pitching for Pittsburgh against  Montreal. The elbow was hurt on a third-strike pitch to Hubie Brooks, now with  the Dodgers.  </P> <P> After undergoing surgery on May 12, Gott missed the remainder of the season and  became a free agent this winter. The Dodgers signed him despite worries about  whether he would be ready for the start of the season. Now, they are worrying  less. "I see no problems with him right now, knock on wood," said bullpen coach  Mark Cresse, who has been catching Gott. "It looks like he is finished  rehabilitating and ready to go."  </P> <P> Dodger Notes  </P> <P> A visitor to the workout was former Dodger pitcher Rick Rhoden, who is a free  agent. Vice President Fred Claire said Rhoden "is somebody you would have to  give consideration to." . . . Claire said he declined a request for a tryout by  former Dodger pitcher Tommy John. . . . Although the Dodgers and outfielder Kal  Daniels are set for arbitration Feb. 15, Daniels will probably lower his demand  of $700,000 and could settle. Cleveland's Chris James, a player with similar  experience and statistics, recently signed for $560,000. The Dodgers are  offering $550,000.  </P></p>

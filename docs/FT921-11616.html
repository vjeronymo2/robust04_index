			<p>920130 FT  30 JAN 92 / International Company News: Reebok shares surge on record results REEBOK, the US sports shoe maker, yesterday posted record sales and earnings for its fourth quarter and the whole of 1991, writes Karen Zagor. The strong results sent Reebok's shares climbing Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 30 3/4 in very active trading. Net income for the fourth quarter was Dollars 49.7m, or 53 cents a share, compared with Dollars 39.5m, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Sales increased 20 per cent in the latest quarter to Dollars 586.6m. For the year, Reebok had net profits of Dollars 234.7m, or Dollars 2.37, a share, against Dollars 176.6m, or Dollars 1.54, in 1990. Sales rose 26.6 per cent to Dollars 2.73bn. Mr Paul Fireman, chairman and chief executive, said that the company forecast 'plenty of opportunity for growth in this recessionary environment.' He said the Reebok brand had gained market share in a relatively flat market. Mr Fireman added that the company had repaid Dollars 165m of the Dollars 215m it borrowed for a stock repurchase in 1991.</p>

			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ronson named in Dollars 83m Pima lawsuit Mr Gerald Ronson and his co-director of Heron International, Mr Alan Goldman, are two of 12 defendants named in an Dollars 83m (Pounds 55.7m) lawsuit initiated by a US federal agency earlier this month. The suit concerns Pima Savings &amp; Loan, an Arizona-based thrift, formerly a subsidiary of Heron. Many believe that without the losses Heron made on Pima it might have avoided the need for a Pounds 1.4bn financial restructuring, which was completed in September. The suit was foreshadowed in Heron's restructuring document published in May. That disclosed that the Resolution Trust Corporation, which is investigating the affairs of Pima, had asserted that Dollars 83m had been lost through 'unsafe and unsound lending practices and mismanagement' among other things. The RTC demanded repayment of the Dollars 83m from the former directors and officers of Pima failing the submission of reasons why the RTC should not seek reimbursement. The document said that Heron was liable to indemnify the directors and officers against the losses. Heron acquired Pima in 1980 and it expanded rapidly. But in the late 1980s it hit problems, along with hundreds of other savings and loan businesses, and Heron attempted to sell it. When these efforts failed, the business was taken over by the Office of Thrift Supervision in March 1990 and later went into receivership. Heron wrote its investment in Pima down to nothing. In the 1990 accounts, Heron showed a loss from discontinued businesses, largely Pima, of Pounds 193.2m, after a Pounds 39.4m loss in 1989. In the lawsuit, filed in Phoenix, Arizona, the RTC claimed that under Heron's ownership Pima had turned from a simple home lender to an aggressive commercial lender chasing a high return on assets.</p>

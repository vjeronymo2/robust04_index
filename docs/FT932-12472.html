			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: German stake in Young Grp YOUNG GROUP, the County Durham-based opencast and drift coal miner, announced yesterday that MG Carbon, a wholly owned subsidiary of Frankfurt-based Metallgesellschaft, had acquired a 29.5 per cent stake. The deal, which gives MG Carbon a seat on the Young board, stemmed from a decision by the company's directors and leading shareholders to increase the financial strength of the company, which has been restructured following serious working capital problems. Mr Brian Calver, Young's chief executive and group managing director, refused to be drawn on whether Metallgesellschaft's involvement meant the group would now bid, with German backing, for any of the 20 British Coal mines being offered to the private sector, but he confirmed: 'It increases the likelihood of Young Group taking a much more positive role in the coal industry.' Young last week announced a loss for the year to November 30 of Pounds 7.9m.</p>

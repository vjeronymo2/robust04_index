			<p><P> November 18, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HYPERION WORK DAMAGED NEARBY HOUSE, SUIT ALLEGES  </P> <P> A former South Bay police chief is suing the city of Los Angeles, claiming that  vibration from construction work at the Hyperion sewage plant has damaged his  nearby El Segundo home.  </P> <P> Jay Stroh, police chief of El Segundo from 1966 to 1970 and of Inglewood from  1971 to 1981, says earthmoving and pile driving on plant property caused  cracking in his floor, driveway and patio, among other places.  </P> <P> In his suit, Stroh, now the director of the state Department of Alcoholic  Beverage Control, claims that the cracks first appeared in November of last  year, during a huge earth excavation project at Hyperion.  </P> <P> "You could see the chandelier and ceiling fans moving, and there was no  earthquake," Stroh said. Pointing out that he and his wife, Jackie, have lived  in their Hillcrest Avenue home for more than 20 years, he said, "the damage  wasn't there before they started doing it, and it's there now."  </P> <P> The city rejects the claims contained in the Torrance Superior Court suit filed  this month, which also names Fireman's Fund Insurance Co., the insurer of the  Stroh's home.  </P> <P> Deputy City Atty. Chris Westhoff said that city-paid soil experts took  measurements in the Hillcrest Avenue area and determined that the vibrations  were not strong enough to cause structural damage. If there was cracking at the  Strohs' house, he said, it is because the building sits on unstable land.  </P> <P> "There's no way our construction did this," Westhoff said. "They are on an  uncompacted, sandy and (sloping) soil which is cut way too steep. It would  creep regardless of what we did at Hyperion."  </P> <P> At issue are the effects of massive excavations that form part of a  $600-million project to rebuild Hyperion, a city of Los Angeles sewage  treatment plant in Playa Del Rey between El Segundo and Dockweiler Beach.  </P> <P> According to Westhoff, about 20 El Segundo homeowners have filed claims  alleging property damage as a result of the work. He said the city has settled  more than a dozen of the claims at a total cost of about $50,000 and is  settling several more, using a $2-million fund set aside for the purpose.  </P> <P> Stroh's is the first claim to progress to a lawsuit. The city rejected his  claim in May, but Westhoff would not rule out a settlement in the case.  </P> <P> "I'd be silly to turn down a settlement that I believe is reasonable," he said.  </P> <P> Westhoff said the city considers the settlements cost-saving steps aimed at  avoiding expensive court battles and rejects the view that, by settling, the  city might be admitting that its sewage project has caused property damage.  </P> <P> Brent Ayscough, Stroh's attorney, acknowledged that he has no scientific  evidence of a link between the construction work at Hyperion and the cracking  in his client's home. But he said he plans to hire an expert to study the  matter and is confident that the findings will support Stroh.  </P> <P> "Houses don't sit someplace for 20 years and then all of a sudden, in a matter  of a few months, they start to crack," he said. "With the relative suddenness  of it all, it just seems highly unlikely that there's no connection" between  the Hyperion work and the cracking.  </P> <P> Westhoff challenged Ayscough to provide proof: "If they are able to demonstrate  through their experts that our experts don't know what they're talking about,  then fine."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACE OF A PLACE;  </P> <P> CHARLIE PASARELL AND TENNIS HAVE BECOME A HOT COMBINATION IN THE DESERT  </P> <P> Early Sunday morning, long before the final of his tennis tournament was to be  played on the center court that he dreamed of in the stadium that he built, the  King Midas of the pro tennis world strolled his grounds and surveyed all that  he had touched. And behold, it was gold.  </P> <P> His real name is Charlie Pasarell, and he is quite young to be king, only  recently turned 45. Around here, he is regularly called "the tennis prince of  the desert." For what he has done with real estate and tennis interest here, a  better nickname might be "the Desert Fox."  </P> <P> He has a restaurant named for him here, Charlie's. He recently had the title of  President of Grand Champions Resort Corporation bestowed on him. For all we  know, he also has his own Angels.  </P> <P> Certainly, his recent impact on the men's pro tennis tournament that has been  played in the desert for 16 years has been heavenly. When he took over its  direction in 1981, as a former star player in the middle 1960s and an employee  of Landmark, a real-estate development company, it was a tournament with a  checkered past. It had been held at Mission Hills, then moved to La Quinta. And  it seemed to go through sponsors and patrons faster than it did tennis balls.  </P> <P> In 1980, when rainstorms hit the desert, the tournament never was completed.  Dozens noticed.  </P> <P> In fact, the roller-coaster history of the tournament prompted one writer, Mark  Winters of Inside Tennis, to label it The Pat Cash Tournament: "When it was  good, it was very, very good. But when it was bad, it was awful."  </P> <P> Once Pasarell started getting the knack for this tennis tournament racket, the  sport began to really bloom in the desert. Ironically, the blooming began in a  dusty parking lot.  </P> <P> "Four years ago, Charlie took me out into the parking lot at La Quinta," said  Gerry Smith, vice-chairman of Newsweek magazine, the current main sponsor of  Pasarell's tournament. "There really wasn't any place else to put down two  chairs and spread out plans and blueprints. So there we sat, in the dirt,  looking at Charlie's dream."  </P> <P> A short time later, Pasarell was giving Smith a closer look at his dream, still  bearing little semblance to reality.  </P> <P> "He took me over to where the stadium is now," Smith said, "and we stood up on  top of this huge sandpile and he said, 'There's center court.' And he pointed  off in the distance, to some cement pilings, and he said, 'There's where the  hotel, Grand Champions, will be.'  </P> <P> "All that I did is have the blind foresight to agree with his vision."  </P> <P> Pasarell's vision included some ugly sights, such as workers going around the  clock under huge lights for the last three weeks before the hotel opening and  first tournament in the new stadium three years ago.  </P> <P> "It looked like a war zone," Pasarell said. "They poured the last part of the  driveway leading into the hotel at 3 a.m. the day it opened.  </P> <P> In the end, the hotel and stadium construction project, a complex that Pasarell  knew was needed if the tournament was to take on increasing stature, cost $100  million. Of that, $16 million went to build the stadium that now seats 10,500  and gets raves all over the tour.  </P> <P> Sunday, when Miloslav Mecir beat Yannick Noah in an exciting five-set final, it  marked the third year of play in Pasarell's Palace. The total prize money,  mostly loose change a few years ago, was $702,500. Mecir got $136,700, the  equivalent of about one-quarter of a two-bedroom home, without a view, in  Southern California.  </P> <P> Next year's Champions Cup will offer prize money of $1 million and is  designated as one of a select group of "Championship Series" tournaments. This  year, 30 of the top 40 players in the world competed here. Next year, it is  expected to be even more popular.  </P> <P> And all this via the vision of a man named Charles Manuel Pasarell, who grew up  in Puerto Rico, battled Arthur Ashe for the No. 1 spot on UCLA's tennis team,  rose to the spot as top player in the United States in 1967 and one of the top  10 in the world, and, interestingly, has left his playing legacy on the game  with his participation in two of the longest matches in history, a 6-hour  23-minute doubles match in 1968 and his famous 5-hour 12-minute match over two  days with Pancho Gonzales at Wimbledon.  </P> <P> His is a personality of perseverance.  </P> <P> So the Grand Champions is fast becoming a happening, an in-thing for tennis  fans, so much so that it even inspired some ridiculous hyperbole after the  Mecir-Noah match. Said one of the corporate types presenting one of the awards  on center court, "When the history of tennis is written, Grand Champions will  be its biggest prize."  </P> <P> That, of course, sent reporters scrambling to call their offices to see if  Wimbledon had been canceled.  </P> <P> Standing nearby when said hyperbole was uttered was Pasarell, who didn't appear  to be the least bit flustered. He merely smiled, just as he will on the way to  the bank for years to come.  </P></p>

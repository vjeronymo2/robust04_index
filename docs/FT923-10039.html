			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Markets: At a Glance - Underlying problems worsen in the housing market The underlying problems of the housing market are getting steadily worse and mortgage repossessions are set to run at alarming levels for the next few years. That was the bleak message from the Council of Mortgage Lenders this week. Although the number of homes repossessed in the first half of this year was slightly down, the figures for people with serious mortgage arrears are rising sharply. The number of people with mortgage arrears of more than 12 months has tripled since the end of 1990 and now stands at 113,860. A further 191,280 borrowers are more than six months behind with their mortgage payments. Even if half are saved, as the CML hopefully predicts, it now seems certain that repossessions could continue to run at around last year's level of 75,540 or more for the next two or three years.</p>

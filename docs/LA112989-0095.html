			<p><P> November 29, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pan Am to Hike Holiday Fares: Pan American World Airways said it plans to raise  its discount fares during the busy Christmas travel season, boosting MaxSaver  ticket prices on domestic routes by $10 to $20 round-trip. None of Pan Am's  competitors matched the increases, and all of them said they were studying the  proposed fares. One airline official said he doubts that other airlines will go  along with the increases -- which probably would force Pan Am to cancel them --  because passenger traffic is generally low this year. Separately, Delta Air  Lines belatedly matched a $5-to-$8-per-trip increase in full fares instituted a  week ago by United Airlines.  </P></p>

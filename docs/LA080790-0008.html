			<p><P> August 7, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATISTICS ON SMOKING  </P> <P> So you want to ban smoking in all eating establishment? Well you go right ahead  and do that little thing. And when the 40% of smokers stop eating out, the  restaurants can do one of two things.  </P> <P> If business falls off 40%, they can: close or raise the price of a $20 dinner  40% to $28. Remember, the loss has to be made up somewhere, and I would be  delighted to see these zealots pay an additional 40% for their dining in a  "smoke-free environment." I'll stay home and barbecue.  </P> <P> And when you leave that "smoke-free" environment, don't breath on the way home.  L.A.'s filthy air is gonna kill you a lot quicker than my secondhand smoke. But  that doesn't seem to be an issue with you people.  </P> <P> KAREN SAWYER  </P> <P> Azusa  </P></p>

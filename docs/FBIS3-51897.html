Los Teques became the stage of violent student  demonstrations  during the funeral of a high school student killed last night by  a teargas grenade. According to related reports, demonstrators  hurled rocks at regional and municipal government installations  (of Miranda State, which extends to the east and southwest of  Caracas). Demonstrators also set two vehicles on fire.    Jessica Diaz, a 16-year-old high school student, died last  night during a student protest, when she was struck in the head  by a teargas grenade. In the morning, tense calm was reported  in Los Teques as a vigil for Diaz concluded amid expressions of  sorrow by her classmates, who gathered under strong police  surveillance. Under the watchful eyes of the militarized  National Guard, violence erupted when the funeral procession  began marching toward the local cemetery to bury Diaz.    [Paris AFP in Spanish at 2119 GMT on 26 January transmits a  related 150-word, Puerto La Cruz-datelined report that adds:  "Witnesses today said that student demonstrations, which have  been shaking Venezuela for two weeks so far, have again spread  to the tourist city of Puerto La Cruz, where a truck driver was  injured and 11 students were arrested."]</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ARGENTINE RIOTING SUBSIDES; EMERGENCY LAWS ENACTED  </P> <P> A wave of food riots began to subside Wednesday as the government set up  emergency soup kitchens and handed out rations of essentials, but growing  shortages of food and cash raised the specter of renewed conflict.  </P> <P> Police reported that a few supermarkets were sacked and that officers clashed  with mobs in a few poor areas, but the disorder was on a far lesser scale than  on Monday and Tuesday, when several hundred stores were ransacked.  </P> <P> In some areas, shopkeepers gave away their stock to avoid being attacked, but  elsewhere owners defended their stores with firearms, in three instances  reportedly killing would-be looters in the Buenos Aires suburb of Moreno.  Crowds roved some areas armed with sticks and guns, demanding food from stores.  </P> <P> Authorities confirmed eight deaths since Sunday, but unofficial accounts put  the toll at up to 17, with hundreds wounded in one of the nation's most serious  outbreaks of civil unrest, triggered by hyperinflation that sent prices of  basic goods out of reach of most Argentines. More than 2,000 people reportedly  have been arrested.  </P> <P> The Congress on Wednesday enacted emergency measures and a package of laws  raising taxes and reducing subsidies to provincial industrial programs,  designed to cut back a huge government deficit that is seen as a key cause of  the inflation, which surged to about 70% for May alone.  </P> <P> Although a high-tension peace returned to most areas, residents warned that  none of the emergency measures addressed the basic problems of impossibly high  prices and shriveling wages. Banks limited withdrawals and exchange houses  stayed closed for lack of currency, leaving people short of cash. Many shops  that escaped the pillaging remained shuttered, creating difficulties in  obtaining goods in the worst-hit areas of greater Buenos Aires and the city of  Rosario.  </P> <P> "We cannot sing a victory song, we can only say that nothing is happening now  -- not that nothing will happen later," said Interior Minister Juan Carlos  Pugliese, in charge of the security operation.  </P> <P> Bread companies, ordered Tuesday to limit prices, threatened to shut down in  protest today and Friday, saying the prices were below their production costs,  which would further aggravate growing shortages. The largest commercial  organization called on the government for "a greater severity and firmness in  stopping the pillage."  </P> <P> In Rosario, the second-largest city about 165 miles northwest of Buenos Aires,  the provincial deputy governor, Antonio Vanrell, told reporters: "The problem  now is food. We have problems feeding the 1,000 people in custody -- and the  security reinforcements."  </P> <P> President Raul Alfonsin and President-elect Carlos Saul Menem of the Peronist  party agreed in a meeting on the need for the 30-day state of siege imposed by  Alfonsin on Monday night to restore order.  </P> <P> Menem, elected in a landslide on May 14, said he and Alfonsin did not discuss  demands from labor and business leaders that Menem's inauguration be moved  forward from Dec. 10. Many sectors have called for an early transition to end  uncertainty and to allow the new government to begin implementing its programs.  </P> <P> Menem disclosed that his economy minister, the most important appointment in  the context of the current crisis, will be Miguel Roig, an executive of Bunge  &amp; Borg, a grain-exporting conglomerate. The president-elect said he hopes  the choice of a business leader will reassure the jittery financial sector.  </P> <P> Throughout the capital Tuesday night, an eerie calm descended as stores,  theaters and restaurants closed early and workers raced home, even though there  were no reports of incidents within the city. However, many shops stayed open  late Wednesday night as owners were emboldened by the returning calm.  </P> <P> The worst of the conflict occurred in the ring of lower-middle-class industrial  towns around the capital, such as San Miguel and Moreno, where most of the  region's more than 10 million people live. There, nearly every shop stayed shut  all day Wednesday, schools were closed and buses refused to venture into  troubled areas.  </P></p>

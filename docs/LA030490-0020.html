			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENT PAPERBACKS: BORROWED TIME: AN AIDS MEMOIR BY PAUL MONETTE (AVON: $8.95)  </P> <P> In this often moving chronicle, Paul Monette describes the 19-month battle his  lover, Roger Horwitz, waged against AIDS.  </P> <P> A deeply felt account of love and sorrow, "Borrowed Time" recounts how the two  men strove to preserve the life they shared, despite Horwitz's inevitable  decline. The luxuriousness of that life often undercuts the story: Monette and  Horwitz had wealth and connections that enabled them to obtain comforts and  experimental treatments not available to other patients. Despite this flaw,  Monette has written a dignified yet angry testimony to the suffering wrought by  AIDS. "Borrowed Time" is one of the first personal accounts of the sorrows of  the pandemic; unhappily, many more undoubtedly will follow.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 7 [date as received] (KCNA) -- Chinese  Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in a conversation  with his Maltese counterpart referred to the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula, according to a XINHUA report June 7.    Qian said China adheres to the stand of maintaining the  stability on the Korean peninsula and making it nuclear free,  hoping that this issue will be settled through negotiations of  all parties concerned.    It is not a good way to solve the problem by imposing  sanctions. On the contrary, he said, this would make  contradictions acute.</p>

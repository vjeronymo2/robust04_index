			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Schlesinger marks time Given the time it took to get round to it, yesterday's half point cut in the Bundesbank's discount rate was less dramatic than it seems - which is perhaps why, after a moment of initial excitement, exchange and bond markets shrugged it off. It is two months since the Bundesbank last cut official rates: the looming summer holiday period means it could be almost two before it cuts again. That is a long time to wait for only half a point. In past recessions, the bank has cut by a point at a time. Yesterday's decision simply means that the policy of drip-feeding tiny cuts in the repurchase rate will continue. Mr Helmut Schlesinger of the Bundesbank presumably feels comfortable with this because he believes the German recession has reached its nadir. Latest industrial production and business confidence data at least suggest that economic output may have stopped falling. But it is hard to see where recovery will come from and the Bundesbank's continuing caution may place worrying pressures on France. The bank's behaviour indicates a determination to ensure that the German currency does not lose its anchor role within the ERM. That, in turn, means France will be lucky to get away with interest rates lower than those of Germany over anything other than the short term. The Bundesbank may have given it some leeway to do so by a small amount if only because the markets will anticipate another German rate cut at the end of August. Whether that will be enough to alleviate the strain on the French economy is moot.</p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NOW WE KNOW WHAT DOESN'T WORK;  </P> <P> SOUTH AFRICA: THE EXPOSURE OF THE CRUMBLING ECONOMIES OF EASTERN EUROPE IS  AFFECTING BLACK LIBERATION MOVEMENTS THAT ASSUMED SOCIALISM WAS THE WAY OF THE  FUTURE.  </P> <P> Only months ago, the nationalization of South Africa's major industries was  assumed to be a consequence of black majority rule, whenever that might occur.  </P> <P> The debate among black activists and in the townships was on the process rather  than the need for nationalization. Because of capitalism's failure to show a  human face and its robust health under apartheid, most blacks worshiped the  socialist economic system.  </P> <P> Socialist writers had a ready and growing market in the black townships, even  though their writings were banned. Children were frequently named after Fidel  Castro, Mao Tse-tung, Leon Trotsky and Vladimir Lenin.  </P> <P> But events in Eastern Europe have thrown the region's crumbling  state-controlled economies into the world spotlight, with repercussions for  South Africa's liberation theorists. Many are now asking if the future  socialist society on which they built their hopes and sacrifices is a realistic  alternative to the apartheid society they are dismantling.  </P> <P> When the economies of socialist countries were first exposed to be faltering,  black activists rejected the reports, calling them another manifestation of the  ages-old campaign against "our socialist brothers." However, the penny has at  last dropped and it is now accepted that East Bloc socialist governments have  failed to give their citizens a better life.  </P> <P> Stories of housing shortages and long lines for basic necessities are now  reluctantly believed. We have seen Poles asking the much-hated capitalists of  the West to invest in their country. South Africa's neighbor, Mozambique, has  abandoned Marxism-Leninism as the guiding philosophy for that troubled country.  Julius Nyerere's African Socialism experiment in Tanzania was a dismal failure.  </P> <P> A prominent entrepreneur in Soweto says that only a fully free economy, with  the market as sole arbiter, will work. "Look at what is happening in communist  countries," he said. "They are now begging the West for investments and  technology."  </P> <P> South Africa's major liberation movement, the African National Congress, now  promulgates a mixed economy. The Pan Africanist Congress and the Black  Consciousness movement are still officially committed to a socialist Azania,  the name for a liberated South Africa.  </P> <P> With time, the latter two are likely to change their tunes, for it is  increasingly difficult to argue for state-controlled socialism when the world's  communist countries have admitted the system's serious political, social and  economic shortcomings.  </P> <P> There are other, seemingly insurmountable, hurdles to a socialist economy in  South Africa. The country's white business community, which controls 90% of the  wealth and is here to stay, will resist socialism to the bitter end. The  present captains of industry, robbed of their companies and lives of luxury,  would do all in their power to ensure the demise of a socialist economy. This  is the catch that has trapped Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.  </P> <P> Added to this is the lack of a corps of black technocrats, even from the ANC  and PAC, to ensure that government strategies in a planned economy are carried  out.  </P> <P> While socialism may no longer be a path for the future, the case for pure  capitalism is no better, as capitalism shares the blame for South Africa's  present ills. Capitalism and apartheid are two sides of the same coin; if  capitalist structures had the welfare of the blacks at heart, they would not  have pursued labor policies that destroyed black family life and turned  townships like Soweto into mere reservoirs of workers.  </P> <P> South Africa's future economy must address the present disparities, the most  obvious being that blacks are the country's workers and consumers, but not its  producers and employers. If one person, one vote were to come to this country  tomorrow, today's have-nots would still be in the economic underclass. This is  not liberation.  </P> <P> Second, an economy that guarantees the freedom of man, his markets and their  growth is the only base on which to build. The shortcomings of state socialism  and capitalism have prompted blacks to look at the welfare economies in the  Scandinavian countries, particularly Sweden. The shopping, however, continues.  </P> <P> While South Africa's blacks are still the only ones on the continent who have  not attained their liberation from white oppressors, the blessing may be that  this has placed them in a better position to judge and learn from the  shortcomings of the Soviets, Chinese, British and Americans. They will then  come up with a system that will serve their national interests, and not just  one with appealing rhetoric.  </P></p>

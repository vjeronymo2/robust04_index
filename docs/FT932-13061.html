			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Timex 'ready to settle' dispute at Dundee TIMEX, the US multinational company, is ready to settle the increasingly bitter strike at its Dundee plant if the workers and their union - the AEEU  -are willing to negotiate a Japanese-style agreement. This would include an end to demarcation lines, and the introduction of total quality management, multi-skilling and team working. Timex is ready to talk to the union but will insist that it must guarantee - and not just promise - a change in attitude at the plant that will enable the company to reach profitability. The company will not accept any return to business as usual. In his first interview since the strike began, Mr John Dryfe, Timex's US vice-president, said from the company's Connecticut headquarters: 'All we want from the employees and the unions is an acceptance of the same greenfield site conditions and attitudes at the Dundee plant that they are happy to negotiate with any new foreign company which decides to invest in Britain. 'We want to turn our operations in Dundee into a world-class manufacturing facility and encourage our employees to participate in achieving this.' He added: 'The company is saying 'let us co-operate together on solving the problems of the 1990s, not go on fighting the battles of the 1920s and '30s. The world has changed. We all have to adapt. Otherwise we are going to face disaster.'' He added: 'Making circuit boards for electronic companies requires higher concentration and discipline on the production lines.' Since the dismissal of the 340 production workers at the lossmaking Dundee plant 13 weeks ago, the company's US head office has kept a close watch on events. The plant is continuing to produce circuit boards under contract for the electronics industry with 210 replacement workers helped by office staff and management. Mr Dryfe said he regretted that the company had had to dismiss all its original employees but he added that there had not been a master plan. 'It was never our intention to sack all our employees but we were forced into it,' he said. 'I believe we were left with no alternative if we wanted to keep the plant in business. Underlying everything else is the fact that the sub-contracting business is very competitive. We thought and still believe we were in danger of losing our business customers and we would be left without a future,' he added. Mr Dryfe said that another reason for the company's decision was the breakdown of trust between the company and local union officials: 'We saw no willingness by local union officials to compromise.' He added that Timex does not feel the same lack of trust towards union officials at a higher level. Within hours of what he claims was an agreement last February on layoffs, a pay freeze and a cut in benefits, Mr Dryfe said he was surprised to find that local union officials had rejected it. At two mass meetings the Timex workers then threw out the deal but agreed to go back to work 'under protest'. Mr Dryfe said he did not know what this was supposed to mean: 'We could only conclude if they came back they would immediately go out on strike again.' He added: 'We warned the workers individually by letter they would be fired if they did not accept all four points in the deal.'</p>

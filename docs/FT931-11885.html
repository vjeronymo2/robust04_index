			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Trident Dock Contest: Tense campaign waged with ferocity and scare tactics WHATEVER THE outcome in the battle between Devonport and Rosyth, the protests will be loud. Rosyth royal dockyard is the biggest single industrial site in Scotland, and Devonport the biggest in south-west England. Both areas suffer from high unemployment and failure to win the nuclear contract, which would guarantee jobs well into the next century, will shatter local morale. Hence the ferocity of the political campaign that has been raging between the dockyards for nearly two years. It is likely to be seen as a classic political lobbying campaign, involving national defence, the future of the Royal Navy, judgments on value for money and political expediency. Scare tactics have also been used: Rosyth's management has dropped hints about nuclear safety risks at Devonport; a study commissioned by Devonport questioned the strategic and political wisdom of concentrating all nuclear work in Scotland. In addition, a senior defence ministry civil servant has faced allegations of bias; and both sides have complained that the goalposts for tendering have been moved to their disadvantage. A director of Devonport Management said: 'It is like being at war for the last two years. It has dominated all our waking hours and involved all our families.' The sentiment could equally have come from Rosyth. The yard there has been building a special dock, known as RD57, since 1987 and was initially the natural choice for a reduced submarine programme. But Devonport Management realised that its future would be bleak, or non-existent, without the nuclear contract. The question was how to go about getting it, with Rosyth apparently home and dry. A series of brainstorming sessions was held to decide how Devonport could do the work more cheaply. The answer was to upgrade the docks at Devonport rather than build new ones. Devonport sent its unsolicited proposal to the MoD and, crucially, to the Treasury in April 1991. Both liked the proposals in principle, and a more detailed analysis was completed by the following November. The plan was for a Pounds 170m development over 10 years aimed at undercutting the cost to the government of going ahead with Rosyth's Pounds 400m RD57 project. In addition to the two docks in Devonport's present submarine complex, it planned to adapt three big dry docks designed before the first world war to accommodate battleships. Devonport said its scheme would save Pounds 250m on construction costs and as much again in ship maintenance through economies of scale in refitting over the rest of the decade. It was a masterstroke that received the backing of the Navy, threw Rosyth off balance, and immediately put Devonport in with a chance of victory on cost grounds. The original MoD strategy of placing the contract with Rosyth was dropped in favour of an open competition between the two yards. This was when 'the great nuclear race' really started. Rosyth recognised that if the MoD decided to cut the number of dockyards from two to one, the survivor would almost certainly be Devonport. It therefore had to persuade the MoD it should stick to a dual site plan for refitting Trident and all other submarines at Rosyth and preserve Devonport for surface ships. Its campaign had two strands. First, to demonstrate to the MoD that a Trident operation at Rosyth would be the most cost-effective. Second, to ensure that ministers and MPs realised that if Rosyth did not win the Trident contract the yard would eventually close, creating an economic catastrophe for Scotland and a political disaster for the Conservative party, which has only 11 out of 72 Scottish MPs. Meanwhile Devonport, having scored with its technical campaign, launched a parallel political campaign to gain wider support for winning the nuclear contract. It was decided that outside help was needed, and a year ago the Rowland Group, a Saatchi public relations company, was commissioned to lobby the media and promote Devonport's case at Westminster and in Whitehall. Similarly, Rosyth hired the Westminster consultants GJW to help put its case, and made use of the fact that in Mr Ian Lang, Scottish secretary, Scotland had a voice in cabinet and a force of civil servants in the Scottish Office who could be relied on to support its case on regional economic grounds. Devonport has been well aware of its relative lack of political clout nationally but it has been supported vigorously by the Labour-led Plymouth City Council, local unions, and the Conservative-led Devon and Cornwall county councils. Rosyth argues that the dice have been loaded consistently against its bid. It maintains that Devonport was 'invited out of the blue' to submit its initial bid for the Trident contract, while the MoD was urging Rosyth to concentrate on improving the RD57 scheme instead of considering a cheaper upgrade option. In response to Devonport's Pounds 170m upgraded scheme, Rosyth last June cut the cost of RD57 from Pounds 400m to Pounds 267m by abandoning the plan to put the whole facility under cover. Then in December, when the cost of Devonport's project had been pared to Pounds 130m, Rosyth submitted yet another plan. It would be prepared to drop its new-build scheme and, like Devonport, convert existing docks to take Trident at a cost of Pounds 147m. It was told on January 14 that the scheme had been rejected. It was then that Rosyth decided to make a last bid to save the contract. Mr Allan Smith, Rosyth managing director, contacted Mr Lang and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, and met the Scottish media. The protests worked, and on January 18 Downing Street announced that the period of consultation would be extended.</p>

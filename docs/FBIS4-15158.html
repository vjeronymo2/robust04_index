			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Stepan Khmara, chairman of the Ukrainian </F> Conservative Republican Party, by Viktor Shapoval; place and  date not given: "Stepan Khmara Was Elected to the Parliament.  It Is Cloudy in Ukraine"]    [Text] [Shapoval] First of all, let me congratulate you  for your victory. What was your first thought, when you learned  the results of voting?    [Khmara] I always believed in victory. I did not have any  doubts about it, and I was simply interested in numbers. I  would like to thank all the people, particularly, my voters, who  trusted, supported, and helped me during the electoral campaign.  Although we did not have money for the campaign, we proved that  it is possible to win without it. It once again came to me that  our people are able to achieve a lot. Without the help of the  people, I would not have had the chance of dealing with  politics. Despite all the efforts undertaken by our enemies,  and despite the incompetence of authorities, the voters made  their choice.    [Shapoval] What was the reason behind your success?    [Khmara] I would not like to boil everything down to  politics. What led me to politics and always determines my  behavior is the desire to leave a humane trace on this sinful  earth. I want to do good for our Ukraine and my people. The  truth has won. It is said in the Bible: You will find the  truth and the truth will set you free. People link Khmara to  decency, honesty, and diligence. Khmara and the voters have  become a whole. A deputy must always remember that a  legislative seat is not his property, but the voters'.    [Shapoval] You are often accused of populism. How would you  respond to these accusations?    [Khmara] What does populism mean? If populism means to be  with the people and defend their interests, I will always  endorse it. After all, only the support of the people allows me  to be accomplished in politics.    [Shapoval] In the elections, you confirmed your renown and  achieved success. Viktor Pynzenyk and Ihor Yukhnovskyy also  won. Is it possible for you to cooperate?    [Khmara] When Viktor Pynzenyk was in the government, I  always tried to cooperate and help him. Unfortunately, this did  not yield any results. I am skeptical toward him. This man  fulfills the will of people who are behind the scenes.    Ihor Rafayilovych [Yukhnovskyy] is a master of dodging.  Once, 12 people's deputies had a bitter conversation with him.  We seriously warned him against destructive activities. This  relates to [Ukrainian President] Leonid Kravchuk's decree on  commodity bonds totalling $10 billion. Ihor Rafayilovych  zealously defended the decree. He consciously fulfills someone  else's will.    [Shapoval] How do you assess the results of the first round  of the elections?    [Khmara] When it comes to Halychyna, I am very pleased:  There are already five, perhaps six, people in Khmara's team in  Lvov, Ternopil, and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. This is a serious  force. The second round is still ahead, however, in which our  people will stand pretty good chances, not only in Halychyna,  but also in other regions.    [Shapoval] Do you want to form your own group in the  parliament?    [Khmara] Yes, I want to form a group of hardworking, decent,  and dedicated people who would resist any temptations. A group  of 20-30 single-minded people can significantly influence the  political atmosphere. Now, it can be said that such a group  will exist. Our expectations have partially come true. One  cannot think of a party or faction majority -- which is often  voiced by [Rukh leader] Vyacheslav Chornovil -- without irony,  because those people are so polarized, and their principles are  not defined. Vyacheslav himself has not always been consistent  either. He has rather played the role of a destructive  politician in both Lvov and Kiev. Rukh can only blab. Who are  these people? What are they able to do?    Of course, the situation in Odessa and Donbass elicits  certain concern. A powerful industrial Mafia, which has been  enjoying the most favored status granted by President Leonid  Kravchuk, still remains there. How could he [Kravchuk] allow  for these polls? Our president is completely unable to perform  constructive state- building work. The elections of the Crimean  president were absolutely illegal. Instead of annulling the  decree on elections and pronouncing them illegal, President  Leonid Kravchuk solemnly received the illegal president. For  this alone, Leonid Kravchuk should be removed from power and  brought to account.    [Former Prime Minister] Leonid Kuchma, who also was elected  deputy, is another person very dangerous for Ukraine. He could  be easily neutralized, and I have recently offered my services  with this regard to [Supreme Council Chairman] Ivan Plyushch. I  heard Kuchma saying that Lobov is a man he trusts. Leonid  Kuchma offered to Lobov the office of Cabinet of Ministers  minister which is one of the key offices. Currently, Lobov  lives in France. He stole what he could and left the country.  I demanded that a criminal case be opened against him, to  recover at least a part of the money he stole. People should  know of this, since Leonid Kuchma is running for the  presidential seat.    Generally, I would like to see as many decent people with  common sense in the new parliament as possible.    [Shapoval] The second round of the elections is approaching.  What would you like to say to the voters?    [Khmara] Let them follow the people about whose decency they  are completely sure. If they trust Khmara, let them vote for I.  Kalynets, D. Chobit, O. Hudyma, and V. Dzera. I have political  experience, knowledge, and analytical skills, which have been  confirmed in practice. I, therefore, want the voters to do  precisely that. It is not necessary for Khmara; it is necessary  for Ukraine.</p>

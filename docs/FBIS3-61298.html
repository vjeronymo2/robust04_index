			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> ["Fragments from Report of the Russian Academy of Sciences </F> United States and Canada Institute `The Position of Russia and  Its National Interests'": "Yearning for an Unattainable Future"]    [Text] If Russia manages in the foreseeable future to  overcome the domestic crisis, this will not go unnoticed in  neighboring countries. Many would necessarily prefer an alliance  or simply close relations with Russia to the risk of independent  navigation on the stormy waters of world politics and the world  market.    This is a distant prospect of the development of the Russian  state. But it needs to be discussed even now, when the process  of the recognition and determination of Russia's national  interests is under way. There is no doubt that it should not be  a question of a desire to revive the messianic role of the  tsarist or communist empire but of a strong and stable  democratic Russia becoming an equal and active participant in  the world community capable of performing a positive role in it  and helping other countries resolve problems of poverty, hunger,  disease, and technological backwardness and, most important,  strengthen international security. The interests of a strong and  stable Russia thus do not contradict any legitimate interests of  other countries of the world community but naturally complement  them.    Today, however, Russia is in a state of decline. This is  seen  overseas also.    Against the background of a contradictory attitude toward  the  processes in Russia there was recently an event that evoked  neither a polemic nor a serious response in the country. In a  directive to the foreign policy and financial departments, U.S.  President Clinton proposed that Russia be classed as a  developing state. This was done, it was explained to us, for  purely formal purposes: to simplify the bureaucratic procedures  of the granting of aid to Russia.    However the American side justifies its position, this is  for  us yet another reason for reflecting on the simplest matter:  Where is our society headed? Do Russian politicians understand  that the time allotted us for changes is not unlimited? That  some of the results of the government's activity as of the  present are, truly, putting Russia in the category of a poor  developing country?  <H5>  Foreign Policy: From Illusions to Pragmatism </H5>   The seriousness of the moment being experienced by Russia in  its international position is connected largely with the  unpropitious combination of its progress toward full-fledged  sovereignty on the one hand and the incomplete nature of the  structural reorganization of the global system on the other.  Although there is talk everywhere about the disintegration of  the old bipolar structure of the world and of a return of the  era of multipolarity, virtually, a certain military-political  "sesqui-polarity" continues in the world.    At the same time the self-regulation of the global structure  is in fact taking place, and its dramatic aspect is that not  since the times of the establishment of the Versailles order of  1919, probably, has Russia's participation in it been as passive  as it is today. The difference being merely that at that time  Russia was kept apart from an active role, today it is itself,  rather, on account of many factors, late in formulating its own  legitimate interests and long-term goals.    Meanwhile the situation in which Russian diplomacy is having  to debut in many respects is distinguished by higher-than-usual  complexity. The edifice of the "Yalta-Potsdam order" has  collapsed, but international stability has not become more  durable because of this.    A practice whereby the Seven have in fact become the source  of the controlling impulses in the international system has  taken shape; decisions harmonized by it in advance are assuming  the form of UN statutes; a key role in their realization is  being performed by the efforts of individual countries  semi-independently determining the composition and scale of  their participation coalitions formed on an ad hoc basis.  Diplomacy under the new conditions is performing an important  role, but the military component would no longer seem to be  relegated to the background, as was the case in the recent times  of the Soviet and American accords of 1985-1991.    Economics has become an effective instrument of systemic  regulation. But as the old stabilizing structures have gone into  decline, the natural boundaries of the efficiency of economic  factors have been revealed also. Evidence of this have been the  fruitless attempts to apply economic sanctions in the Iraq and  Yugoslavia situations, as, equally, the forced use of force in  Tajikistan, which had just about fallen apart under the pressure  of intertribal discord, in the Kartveli-Megreli-Abkhaz conflict  in the Transcaucasus, or, finally, in Somalia.    A whole school of literature developing nonmilitary aspects  of international and national security had appeared in the  preceding five-seven years in Russia. The result of the new mood  at the political level was the adoption of a number of important  measures to limit the omnipotence of the military-industrial  complex. Also oriented from the outset toward continuation of  this policy, with its characteristic predominance of a  negatively skeptical attitude toward armed force, was the  leadership of the Russian Federation, which encountered here the  full understanding of its main overseas partners and world  public opinion.    Events would have developed within the framework of this  tendency, evidently, had it not been for two circumstances.    The disintegration of the USSR brought about a rapid  increase  in inherent conflict in all spheres of interstate relations in  the CIS. The question of armed force immediately came to be at  the center of public attention--initially in the form of a  bitter political struggle "to inherit the Union," subsequently  in the form of a debate on the capacity of each state to defend  its sovereignty and the interests of the citizens against  threats of power encroachments, which had for the first time in  many decades become real. Such was the internal, Russian, aspect  of the problem.    But there was, in addition, the international aspect also.  Approximately on the frontier of 1991 and 1992 an understanding  of the impossibility of regulating international relations as  had been done under the conditions of classic bipolarity--by  means of menacing actions and demonstrations--began to mature  among Western specialists and politicians on the basis of an  analysis of the Yugoslav tragedy and the war in the Gulf. A  perception of the need for some quite serious and effective  steps emerged. Decisions were adopted in this context on  limiting military operations under the aegis of the United  Nations in Bosnia and Somalia; on the "peace-making functions"  of Russian forces in Tajikistan and Georgia; and discussion of  the position of the great powers in respect to the civil war in  Angola, which is once again threatening to affect the adjacent  states.    All these disquieting trends are prompting another  reevaluation of the military factor in international relations  on the frontier of the new century. The yearning for a still  unattainable future of "general freedom, stability, and  prosperity" must not screen the prosaic conclusion (or working  hypothesis) that the world of the 1990's, which has ceased  to be regulated in bipolar fashion, is evidently experiencing a  need for strong management to a greater extent, virtually, than  the "Yalta-Potsdam order" from 1962 through 1991 had need of  it.  <H5>  Toward Recognition of the Russian `Self' </H5>   Our country does not have manifest enemies, as the United  States and NATO were for the Soviet Union. But it has  simultaneously also been deprived of former allies, on whom the  USSR could rely at least to some extent (India). Calls are being  heard from Moscow insistently for partnership with the civilized  part of the outside world. But this part itself has not  determined either its tasks in a partnership with Russia or its  optimum forms. The interest of the developed part of the  international community in the Russian Federation is painted in  negative colors, in the main: everyone knows more or less  precisely what the new Russia should not be, but has  very confused ideas about what it could and should be  without losing national identity.    This asseveration should be heard, of course, as a rebuke  mainly to ourselves inasmuch as no one can explain to Russia its  status in world politics from outside.    There is no viable partnership based merely on a "pure idea"  and declarations, and a legally formalized system of partner  relations cannot emerge before Moscow clearly outlines the  contours of its national interests. In order for a treaty to be  durable it is essential to anticipate the emergence of  nonconcurrent viewpoints. They should not be, of course, even  potentially mutually exclusive, but they can and will differ.  The task of Russian diplomacy is not propaganda of the dubious  premise of the total coincidence of the foreign policy tasks of  Russia and the progressive part of the world community but close  cooperation on a reasonably wide range of fundamental world  problems and assurance of the West's understanding of specific  aspects of Russia's foreign policy tasks.    This formulation of the issue also presupposes, of course,  great clarity as regards the essence of the phenomenon of  postimperial and noncommunist Russia. It is reasonable to  approach its conceptualization by taking Russia's geopolitical  parameters as the starting point. What follows from the nature  of Russia's interest in foreign policy revealed following the  disintegration of the USSR?    It is understandable that Russia depends exclusively on the  situation in the Northern Hemisphere, where Eurasia and North  America are located, and the direct challenges to Russia's  security lie in continental Eurasia. Europe outside of the  former Soviet Empire would be in a state of stability had not  the Yugoslav cauldron erupted in the Balkans. Germany and France  (and also Italy, perhaps) could potentially embark on a gradual  division of spheres of influence in the former Yugoslavia. This  in itself would disturb stability in the European zone. But the  affiliation to the Yugoslav conflict of the Islamic world, and  that of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey in the future is not ruled  out, could turn the Balkans into a permanent focal point of  tension and a generator of the disintegration of a "united"  Europe and NATO even. Contradictions between the United States  and its European allies could reach a significant level.    Russia is not entangled directly in the Yugoslav knot,  whatever is being said in respect to Serbia. But two unpleasant  consequences ensue from the Yugoslav crisis: Europe will be  mainly preoccupied with the Balkans, paying increasingly less  attention to the post-Soviet geopolitical field, and Turkey,  penetrating it more and more, will raise its international price  quotation.    East Europe is an economic cordon filtering potential  Western  capital investments and also a political cordon for Russia's  integration in the European structures: The opinion that East  Europe is supposed to be there first has taken shape. It cannot  be ruled out that the East European countries will arrive at the  conclusion of a mini-bloc in this composition or the other.    The Baltic cuts off Russia from Scandinavia and Poland (not  to mention the absolute vulnerability of Kaliningrad Oblast) and  is of an anti-Russian frame of mind, on the whole.    Belarus, the country that is the most well-disposed toward  Russia among the young states, has under these conditions  acquired the role, entirely particular and clearly expressed,  but not recognized in Moscow, of sole dependable link between  Russia and Europe.    Ukraine could be both a most important ally of Russia and a  no less powerful enemy. Even if common sense in the sphere of  the economic union prevails, a real political ally has not even  emerged as yet. Ukraine has in fact fenced Russia off from  Southeast Europe.    In Moldova Russia's positions could be strong only in the  event of reunification with Romania beginning to take shape.    Thus a picture wherein Russia objectively cannot perform an  appreciable geopolitical role in Europe emerges (Russia's  submarines could potentially keep the whole world in their  sights, but this in itself would not restore to Russia the  position of globally significant power).    That there is hardly anything that threatens Russia on the  part of Europe is another matter. The loss of geopolitical  function in Europe in itself reduces Russia's role also; but the  geopolitical function is not an end in itself, it is vitally  important whence the threat to the national interests of a  country, particularly its security, emanates.    With the new alignment of forces it would be appropriate to  consider as Russia's base reference point in relation to the  system of geopolitical coordinates the deterrence in world  politics of extremism. To the extent that the main habitat of  their [as published] concentration is the geopolitical south,  the deterrence potential should be oriented in this direction  (although not in this direction alone).    Russia's geopolitical role consists mainly of deterring the  Eurasian South in the broadest sense. The West, concerned with  the defenses of the oceanic part of Eurasia, would not be in a  position to render Russia the least effective support. But  without a system of alliances Russia itself could do nothing  either.    The "doubled," Eurasian, essential content of Russia's  national interest predetermines the need for a carefully  adjusted balance of the western and eastern priorities of  Russia's foreign policy. The currently predominant  "Europe-bound" course is just as unacceptable as the primitive  prescriptions of the search for national interest in the  thickets of "Russian-Tatar" antiquity.    The problem is that the possibilities of Europe are not  unlimited even in the spheres in which it wants and is truly in  a position to help us. European support in the surmounting of  food difficulties and the modernization of the Russian fuel and  raw material sectors is one thing. Actual support in the  stabilization of the immediate surroundings and a strengthening  of the regional security of Russia is quite another. In this  sense Russian and "European" interests coincide in far from all  things.    A durable alliance with Ukraine and Belarus is essential to  Russia, say. But Germany has an objective interest more in the  "dilution" of the western flank of the political space of the  CIS, which inevitably presupposes a more or less lengthy period  of its destabilization. The FRG has already realized a model of  this attitude in the Yugoslav conflict, having gambled on its  escalation.    Nor is there much in common as far as the European and  Russian perceptions of the threat of Islamic extremism are  concerned. As long as Russian forces remain outside of Russia,  this danger will painfully affect Russian interests in the zone  of the Armenian-Azerbaijan conflict, in Tajikistan, and in other  former Union republics of Central Asia. Europe cannot give  Russia practical assistance in deterring or, even less, removing  these threats. Moscow's solidarity with Europe in the approach  to regional conflicts is the equivalent of European solidarity  with Moscow in far from all practical aspects.    That is, there is evidence of support as such, but it does  not go beyond diplomatic and moral support. Because for West  Europe the Asiatic challenges are abstractions in everything  that goes beyond the framework of Islamic-Arab terrorism. And  for Russia, thousands of casualties in the manpower dragged into  senseless regional conflicts and real threats to the territorial  integrity of the state. Euro-Atlantic thinking is not ready for  participation in deterring these threats, nor does it have the  necessary experience.    Yet the specifics of Russia's geopolitical location demand  paramount attention in the sphere of inherent regional conflict.  In failing to give them due attention now Moscow runs the risk  of allowing situations which are no longer theoretical but which  really threaten the European Russian "self" to arise.    There are just two ways to defend it--via reinforcement by  other Slav components (Ukrainian and Belarusian) or via the  formulation of a correct balance of interaction with the East.  The first path is easier and preferable. But politically it is  problematical. In putting undue emphasis on it, Russia would  make itself too dependent on Ukraine and would lose time for the  necessary development of the rational conditions regulating the  degree of its selective openness to the East. Being boundlessly  open to it today would be an archaism preserved since the times  of the "indestructible unity" of Russians, Ukrainians, and  Belarusians. And to the extent that this unity is now being  disputed it is necessary to formulate a strategy of a  strengthening of the Russian state "self," proceeding from the  worst-case scenario--were the country to find itself head to  head with the post-Soviet East.    Russia cannot simply fence itself off from Asia, as Poland,  Estonia, or the EC countries can. Copies of the West European  versions of the foreign policy line are no use. The most complex  challenge is the need to formulate an active policy, preserve  Russia's national identity, and strengthen stability throughout  Western Eurasia.    It is understandable that this task is barely feasible  without the support of allies and partners. All the more  important is it seeking them among the countries really capable  of supporting Russia primarily on questions of the deterrence of  inherent conflict. If there is, indeed, anyone who may be relied  on in this sense, it is not the EC countries but, rather, the  United States--to the extent, of course, that Russia is at all  able to enlist foreign states in the solution of such a delicate  question as a strengthening of national security.  <H5>  Lessons of the Conflicts in the Post-Soviet Space </H5>   The problem of a reduction in Russia's presence in the  regions directly adjoining the present national borders and the  border of the former USSR may be considered the most complex and  painful. It is obvious that Russia cannot carry the burden of  the economic and military-political maintenance of stability in  its outlying areas. Consequently, it is necessary to settle on  the priorities and timeframe of long-term investments in  Russia's national security. An estimation of such a modus  operandi in accordance with the "cost-effectiveness" criterion  is absolutely essential, what is more. These theoretically  absolutely clear propositions have been observed in only a small  number of instances throughout Russian history. Unfortunately,  there are objective reasons for unavoidable involvement in the  conflicts on the territory of the former USSR. We may put in  this category: 1) the so-called Russian-speaking population,  whose interests and security Russia has undertaken to defend; 2)  the economic interdependence of Russia and the countries that  are now its immediate neighbors. It is to the accomplishment of  these tasks that we should pay attention primarily, evidently.  Or sacrifice them in the future for the sake of as pragmatic an  accomplishment as possible of the foreign policy tasks  confronting Russia.    Russia has found itself involved in this form or the other  in  a whole number of armed conflicts on the territory of the former  USSR.    In Tajikistan Russia is engaged in "peace-making" operations  and ensuring the security of the state border between Tajikistan  and Afghanistan in accordance with an interstate agreement and  the mandate of the CIS obtained in accordance with the Treaty on  Collective Security of the CIS.    In Moldova Russia's 14th Combined-Arms Army is engaged in  operations to disengage the parties in the area of Bendery and  the Left Bank of the Dniester in accordance with agreements  concluded among Moldova, the Dniester region, Ukraine, and  Russia.    In Georgia Russian subunits, in accordance with an  interstate  agreement, are exercising a peacekeeping function in the area of  the Georgian-South Ossetian conflict. In addition, Russian  forces have been enlisted in the guarding of the strategically  important Transcaucasus Railroad.    The experience of the Russian Army's participation in the  limited military conflicts on the territory of the former USSR  makes it possible to draw the following conclusions:    (1) Russia is at the present time the sole state that has  the  military, political, and technical resources for undertaking  military operations on the territory of the former USSR,  peacekeeping operations included. In the foreseeable future only  Ukraine and Uzbekistan can, in theory, create such potential.    (2) In the majority of cases (Tajikistan, the  Georgian-Abkhaz  conflict, the conflict in the Dniester region) Russian forces  were pulled into the armed conflicts by way of escalation before  the Russian leadership adopted the decision to use them. This  testifies that the mere fact of the deployment of subunits of  the Russian Army outside of its national territory (particularly  in areas where armed conflicts are already under way or are  potential) inevitably entails considerable military and  political costs.    (3) Russia's participation in the so-called peacekeeping  operations could be associated with the active use of military  force going beyond the limits of self-defense. From the  viewpoint of legal regulation the approach to such operations  should be the same as in the case of the use of force in  interstate clashes. Unfortunately, the narrowness of the  legislative base has been revealed in the course of Russia's  participation in these conflicts. As a whole, the possibility of  Russia's becoming pulled into military conflicts on the  territory of the countries of the former USSR not as a result of  an independent policy decision but by virtue of some  international agreements and in accordance with a decision of  supranational authorities, which at the present time is possible  as a result of Russia's ratification of a package of military  agreements within the framework of the CIS, should be completely  excluded.    (4) Russia should state openly that it is not nor can it be  a  guarantor of the security of all states of post-Soviet Eurasia.  It is essential to enshrine in legislation the provision that  the security guarantees granted states of the CIS by Russia  extend only to the field of interstate relations, not affecting  internal conflicts or conflicts between countries of the CIS.    (5) Russia's participation in limited military conflicts on  the territory of the former USSR will inevitably create two  serious political problems, at least. First, a precedent for  Russia's further enlistment as a "policeman" for the  accomplishment of its local military-political tasks. Second,  Russia's active participation in such conflicts could shape an  extremely unprofitable image of our country--as the "gendarme of  Eurasia." This danger is increased by the fact that in not one  instance of the peacekeeping operations undertaken by Russia has  it had a UN mandate.  <H5>  Public Opinion and Russia's Relations With the West </H5>   The West's loyal attitude toward Russia will remain in the  foreseeable future a principal condition of the success of the  Russian reforms. At the same time there is no doubt that the  methods by which Smolenskaya Ploshchad has endeavored to secure  a mutual understanding with the democratic countries are largely  played out. We are talking primarily about the endeavor to  persuade the West of the constructive nature of Moscow's  intentions by means of radical concessions in the fields in  which the advantages of the USSR, and then of Russia, were  considered, conditionally speaking, not entirely legitimate.  Among these concessions were positions that Moscow had acquired,  first, by virtue of power and para-power ambitions (strategic  arms) and, second, as a result of imperial aspirations.    It has to be acknowledged that this policy has, in a sense,  been successful: The West has recognized in greater depth its  dependence on the success of the Russian reforms. But  simultaneously the line of the radicals in Yeltsin's team has  had its drawbacks also. Raised on the idea of Russia's  great-power status, the population of the country has perceived  variously Moscow's new role as obliging partner of the West.    The disenchantment with the government's foreign policy line  increased markedly when questions of the defense of Russian  interests in the new independent states of the former USSR, for  which the foreign policy department proved to be wholly  unprepared, "suddenly" came to be within the jurisdiction of the  Russian Foreign Ministry.    The pent-up dissatisfaction of part of society with the  reforms in their radical version could easily assume and  inevitably will assume, if this is not prevented, the form of  anti-West protests and xenophobia. It is for this reason that  the demonstrative emphasis of the unity and proximity of the  Russian leadership and the leadership of Western countries,  characteristic both of officials and the mass media, could at  the level of the everyday consciousness, as before, be  associated both with the West's incapacity for really improving  the situation in Russia and with the reluctance of the  president's team to probe the essence of the inherently Russian  singularities of the difficulties which are being experienced on  account of a desire "not to retreat one step" from Western  standards.    The anti-American, anti-West mood today, as distinct from  the  recent Soviet period of our history (1985-1991), is an entirely  significant aspect of Russia's foreign policy life.  <H3>  Specific Features of Russia's National Interest in Relations  With the Outside World </H3>   A probable source of the indecisiveness of Russian diplomacy  in 1991-1993 in the shaping of national tasks was the weakness  of its scientific-analysis support. Another was the objective  complexity of the process of recognition of the new position of  the Federation in the international system. But the most  essential reason in this respect in the recent period has been  the instinctive fear of counterposing Russia to its Western  partners, which could be explained also as an inability to  explain to them the national specifics of Russia's foreign  policy interests and to secure the West's understanding of these  specifics and its fair attitude toward them.    One has the impression that Russian diplomacy is abandoning  at every step the formulation of its own vision of this  international reality or the other even when its Western  partners are expecting and revealing signs of a readiness to  understand this particular vision. The shaping of Russia's  approach to the new independent states of the former Yugoslavia  is the most striking example. It is well known that at the end  of 1991-start of 1992 there was no unity among the NATO  countries on the question of recognition of Croatia and  Slovenia, which had broken away from the Yugoslav Federation.  Germany was emphatically demanding support for Croatia, while  the United States was referring to the need to preliminarily  secure from Croatia assurances of its observance of a whole  number of conditions. France adopted a guarded attitude toward  Germany's opinion also.    The Russian Foreign Ministry was practically immediately  oriented toward unconditional support for Germany's viewpoint,  which was manifestly at odds with Russia's historical policy.  Russia's diplomatic recognition of Croatia came two months  before the United States arrived at this decision. Yet it is the  unresolved nature of the questions about which America's  diplomats had been speaking from the very outset that have led  to the protracted and bloody war. And this despite the fact that  for the United States or Germany the question of relations with  the new states of Yugoslavia is predominantly of humanitarian  and economic interest, while for Russia it could be a principal  strategic direction of its entire European policy. The  Yugoslavia situation afforded an exceptionally propitious  opportunity for acquiring experience for the championing of our  particular vision of the situation while remaining at the same  time within the framework of "normal" differences with our  partners. This opportunity was let slip. And Russian diplomacy  has simply failed in relations with its Western partners to  master the "ethics of refusal."    The negative consequences of the policy of the passive  "following of the West" are manifold. In first place is the  disorientation of Russia's foreign partners in an understanding  of the events and processes occurring in the country. Western  politicians and experts on Russia could be forming an extremely  approximate and superficial opinion of the extent to which  Kozyrev's foreign policy line is contributing to the success of  the reforms in Russia and how strongly it is provoking public  disagreement with the president's policy as a whole. It is still  hard for the West to appreciate the correlation between possible  gains from support for the present "universalist" foreign policy  of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the potential losses from it  for Yeltsin's political base.    A second negative result of the present policy could be the  Western partners' crisis of confidence in what is being said  about foreign policy in Russia. The West has become accustomed  to building its relations and assessments of the Russian  situation on the grounds of assurances of Moscow's  like-mindedness and solidarity with the Seven. It if turns out  that this policy is in fact undermining the prestige of the West  in Russia and programming an inevitable anti-West political  tilt, Russian foreign policy will find itself in an extremely  difficult position. It would hardly make sense for Russia to  attempt to appear to the West better than it objectively can be  today.    In general form the most urgent task for Russian diplomacy  is  to defend in relations with the world community its "right to  specific features"--defend in such a way as not only to not  intimidate the West but, on the contrary, to afford it an  opportunity to put together, finally, a realistic idea of what  the actual contours of Russia's national interests are. There  undoubtedly are coincident and unifying aspirations of Russia  and the West. The task is merely to conscientiously explain to  ourselves and our partners their outlines. And simultaneously  provide information on certain, most important, inherently  Russian interests. These are:    first, assurance of strategic stability in the post-Soviet  political space with interaction with democratic countries and  within the framework of internationally recognized standards of  foreign policy behavior and possible future accords in this  connection with the United States and other interested states;    second, defense by nonmilitary methods of the personal  rights  of Russians and national communities oriented toward Russia,  whose emergence in countries of the "new abroad" is historically  connected with the existence of the Soviet Union and the share  of moral responsibility for its policy which is inevitably left  to the Russian Federation;    third, the elaboration of a plan of interaction with  individual components of the Federation, partnership with the  new independent states in the post-Soviet space, and a general  vision of world economic and political problems which is its own  and historically distinct, but which remains within the limits  of the democratic and liberal models of social relations.</p>

			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Slough Estates reduces dividend SLOUGH Estates, the UK's fourth biggest property company, yesterday became the first large company in its sector to cut its dividend. The company reversed its policy of holding its dividend a few weeks ago, in response to deepening concern about the economy. 'The worries over the currency and the fact that the North American recovery has stalled means that now is the time to take a more prudent view,' said Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman. 'For the property sector at large, rental and capital growth prospects are slight and are unlikely to improve in the short term,' he said. He warned that a rise in interest rates would be a severe setback, because it would increase business failures and dent confidence of potential tenants. However, the 'reduced level of payment should be sustainable even if the recession is prolonged'. Sir Nigel said the 'climate had changed' for dividend reductions, following cuts in payments by companies such as BP. City analysts predict that other large property companies, such as Hammerson will follow suit. As well as cutting the interim dividend from 4.4p to 3.1p, Slough forecast a cut in the the final dividend from 7.15p to 5p. Investors had anticipated a cut in the dividend, which was uncovered by earnings, and the shares rallied from 89p to 95p. Slough also said pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 19.1m to Pounds 33.6m for the six months ended June 30. These were reduced by Pounds 5.5m of provisions taken against property trading assets in the UK, Australia and the US, compared with provisions of Pounds 10.9m a year ago. Sir Nigel saw no further need for major provisions, but could not rule out 'top-ups' of existing provisions. The group's properties' occupancy levels increased from 87 per cent to 87.6 per cent. About 85 per cent of the 318,000 sq ft construction programme is leased or pre-sold. The rise in profits stemmed from smaller provisions, an increase in operating profits from Pounds 55.9m to Pounds 57.0m and a fall in net interest from Pounds 18.6m to Pounds 14.8m. The net interest charged excluded Pounds 20.9m of capitalised interest, down from Pounds 27.7m. Earnings per share were 6.7p, up from 4.7p. Lex, Page 14; Observer, Page 13</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To address the concerns raised by the commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding a bank's reporting of consolidated financial data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Systemwide disclosure, the FCA has removed the wording  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``bank-only'' from &sect;630.4(c)(1) and clarified that, if a bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is required to prepare consolidated financial statements in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accordance with GAAP, it is appropriate that the bank  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide consolidated financial data of the bank and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consolidated subsidiaries to the Funding Corporation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Conforming changes were also made to &sect;630.20(m)(3) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Appendix A of the final rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 630.4(d)_Responsibilities of Associations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed &sect;630.4(d) provides the banks with access to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their related associations' auditors for preparation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> report to investors. The FCC commented that the banks  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sometimes may need to have access to others, such as legal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> counsel. To ensure that the banks have the ability to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain any information necessary to accurately prepare their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submission to the Funding Corporation, the FCC suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the regulation include a general statement that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks may have access to any material association  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information. Under sections 2.2 and 2.12 of the 1971 Act,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each association is subject to supervision by its related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bank. Each Farm Credit Bank is responsible for preparing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the combined financial statements of the bank and related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations for disclosure to shareholders pursuant to part  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 620 of this chapter. Part 620 of this chapter does not,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, specify how the disclosure responsibilities between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks and related associations are shared. To clarify this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue for purposes of part 630, the FCA has expanded  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed &sect;630.4(d) by adding a general statement in &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 630.4(d)(1) of the final rule to require that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> association provide its related bank with the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessary to allow the bank to provide accurate and complete  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information to the Funding Corporation for preparation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the report to investors. The original text of proposed &sect; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 630.4(d) has been redesignated as &sect;630.4(d)(2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Section 630.5_Prohibition Against Incomplete,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inaccurate, or Misleading Disclosure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC suggested that the FCA clarify that &sect;630.5  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerning prohibition against incomplete, inaccurate, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> misleading disclosure would apply only when the defective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure is material. Since compliance with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disclosure standards of this part is generally subject to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materiality test in any event, the FCA finds it unnecessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to add the suggested materiality language to &sect;630.5 and has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted this section as proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> E. Section 630.6_System Audit Committee and Bank Audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Section 630.6(a)(2)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under &sect;630.6(a)(2), officers or employees of a System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution are prohibited from serving on the System Audit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Committee (SAC) because they are not independent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management. The FCBT urged the FCA to prohibit System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> directors from serving on the SAC due to potential conflicts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of interest based on competition between System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA believes that the suggested prohibition would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be disruptive to the existing SAC and force the Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation to recruit SAC members from outside the System.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the FCA views the FCBT's argument as relating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> less to conflict of interest than to concern regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preservation of the confidentiality of information reviewed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the SAC. Under section 4.9 of the 1971 Act, directors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and management of System institutions are eligible to serve  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the board of the Funding Corporation. As a practical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter, any information available to SAC members is equally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available to the members of the board of the Funding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation. Thus, precluding System directors from serving  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the SAC would not necessarily prevent confidential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information from being exposed to directors of other System  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> banks. In light of these considerations, the FCA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopting the rule as proposed but will monitor SAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> activities for apparent inappropriate use of information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the FCA notes that &sect;630.6(a) does not prevent the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funding Corporation board from adopting a policy to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disqualify System directors from serving on the SAC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iii)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCC commented that the word ``approve'' contained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iii) of the proposed rule implies that the SAC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has the authority to dictate individual bank accounting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policies or that the Funding Corporation has the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require banks to uniformly and consistently adopt or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change accounting policies. This was not the intent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule. The primary duty of the SAC is to ensure the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> integrity of the report to investors jointly prepared by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Funding Corporation and System banks. The SAC is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for overseeing the reporting process and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> internal controls implemented by the Funding Corporation for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of the System's report to investors. To clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that neither the SAC nor the Funding Corporation is charged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the responsibility for dictating individual banks'  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accounting polices, the FCA has substituted the word  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``review'' for the word ``approve'' as suggested.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Section 630.6(a)(4)(iv)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under proposed &sect;630.6(a)(4)(iv), the SAC is required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to review each disclosure document containing Systemwide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information prescribed in this part, including annual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reports, quarterly reports, and press releases, prior to its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> release. The FCC commented that the SAC's responsibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should pertain only to financial information and disclosures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in the annual information statements because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SAC generally would not have the expertise to review and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluate nonfinancial information, such as is found in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of business and description of debt securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCC also suggested that, to facilitate timely issuance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of quarterly information, the requirement for a review of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> each quarterly report or press release by the SAC prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its release be eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

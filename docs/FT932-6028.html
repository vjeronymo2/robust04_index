			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Bosnian plea to UN after Serb assault BOSNIA'S Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday appealed to the United Nations to step in and protect the besieged town of Gorazde, which has come under heavy attack from Serbs. At the same time, Italy condemned the 'brutal' killing of three Italian civilian drivers with an international food convoy in central Bosnia. Gorazde, an enclave of 60,000 people encircled by Serb forces, is one of six predominantly Moslem towns already declared 'safe areas' by the UN. But Bosnian Serbs appear to be taking advantage of the international community's delay in implementing the Washington accord on 'safe areas' by stepping up attacks on key areas in eastern Bosnia still under Moslem control. Bosnian radio said 11 people were killed and 34 injured in artillery attacks on Gorazde, where the local population of 35,000 has been nearly doubled by an influx of refugees from nearby areas. There was also fighting in Brcko in north-east Bosnia, as Serb forces resumed efforts to broaden a corridor linking Serbia with Serb-held areas in east and west Bosnia. UN military officials in Vitez disclosed that three Italian civilian drivers were killed by gunmen wearing Bosnian Army uniforms in central Bosnia on Saturday. They said five Italians delivering food were halted by 30 armed men and a woman on the road between Novi Travnik and Gornji Vakuf. The gunmen pulled all five Italians from their vehicles, robbed them and led them away on foot. The officials quoted the two survivors, who were found yesterday, as saying that two of the gunmen then fired at their feet from behind. As the Italians ran, the gunmen fired again, killing three of them. The Yugoslav federal parliament last night voted President Dobrica Cosic out of office. Mr Cosic was toppled by hardline Serb nationalists.</p>

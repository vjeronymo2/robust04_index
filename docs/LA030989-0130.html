			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALL FOR ACTION ON POLICE SUBSTATION  </P> <P> Subsequent to your story on "Police to Add Substation, More Patrols in  Palisades" (Times, Feb. 2), I chaired a meeting on the subject with Capt.  Maurice Moore, West L.A. police subdivision head, and a number of interested  community leaders. Moore advised the group that "no substation was planned; all  that had happened was that the Chamber (of Commerce) would supply space with a  telephone where the one-car patrol officers could file reports and telephone  the Butler Avenue station." He also felt that using private security services  hindered police deployment.  </P> <P> Albeit Capt. Moore was knowledgeable about police services and limitations, it  became obvious that we were speaking to the wrong person. The map unfurled  showed his division responsible for an area of 64.5 square miles from La  Cienega Boulevard west to Pacific Coast Highway, south to the Santa Monica city  line, and north to the mountains. There has to be a change in boundaries as to  what is the Westside. Response time, regardless of promises to do better, can't  be lessened because of the distances. And to suggest that use of private  security services "hinders police deployment" is a non sequitur.  </P> <P> True, a substation is a cost item that would necessitate removing police  officers from patrol (by car; not on foot as some believe), but overlooked is  that a substation might be incorporated into mini-town halls that can serve the  distinct neighborhoods in the Westside, such as the Palisades, with additional  city services that now require citizens to travel either downtown or to the  West L.A. City Hall. Such a facility, tied to parks, libraries, senior citizen  centers, municipal courts, etc., would build the sense of community that is  vital to citizen involvement and the pride to ensure that the neighborhood  remains a place where one can live and enjoy life without some of the urban  problems that frighten so many and endanger us all.  </P> <P> The neighborhood concept can tie into the present City Council system. It  merits discussion. And that's why I indicated earlier that we were addressing  our needs to the wrong man. It's a matter for the mayor and the City Council. I  have written to Tom Bradley and Marvin Braude. The Times may wish to explore  the question as well.  </P> <P> HYMAN H. HAVES  </P> <P> Pacific Palisades  </P></p>

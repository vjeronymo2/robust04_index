			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Regular interview with Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the </F> Georgian Supreme Council and head of state, by Nato Oniani, date  and place not given -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Oniani] The Abkhazian issue was last week's  main topic because documents connected with the internal  settlement of the Abkhazian issue were signed. You have said  that the opposition has to refrain from impeding the authorities  and offer the authorities an opportunity to complete the process  of settling the Abkhazian problem. You have also said that a  lack of hope will lead the country to destruction and that all  our history has been a struggle for freedom, independence, and  hope. You have also spoken of a new world order before. In the  view of what has happened in Georgia recently, including  Abkhazian events, how practical do you think is the hope that  we shall be able to settle this problem?    [Shevardnadze] Thank you. Good morning. Regarding the  Abkhazian issue, I welcome the fact that our conversation deals  with this topic. I should say that we have tried all options  now, and all possibilities have been checked, including the  military option. I envisage that we are dealing with the optimum  version of a practical settlement of the issue. I would like to  say once more that I mean a practical settlement rather than  plans based on (?reports) and our desires. We have to talk in  terms of a really practical version.    I believe that the return of large streams of refugees will  begin soon. The main thing is to get this process started. I  think this will happen very soon. And I request everyone once  again not to pose obstacles to us. The authorities -- and all  of Georgia -- are entrusted with such a large and crucial  mission today that we all have to be concerned that no  additional difficulties are created and no additional  destructive processes take place regardless of whether we agree  with this path or not. Especially if a beneficial trend is  evident, and I am confident that this will be the case.  Proceeding from the common interest, those who do not trust us  -- and there are quite understandable reasons for such people to  exist -- should take at least a neutral position, at least at  this stage. It will be different if we face failure.    I would say that the very existence of Georgia is connected  with the refugee problem. This is how we are dealing with it.  I request the refugees, in the first place, not to give in to  individual politicians who are guided by certain ambitions or a  certain grudge, or who believe only in the efficiency of a  variant they are proposing. Do not give in to those who call  for an adventurous way. This may prove fatal. I am well aware  of their possibilities, and I know that no one is capable of  proposing a more practical version of the settlement than the  existing one. This is especially so since important decisions  pertaining to this issue will be taken in New York very soon.    A military team, who are to plan the deployment of the  peacekeeping forces, and who in fact have already planned it,  have left Moscow for New York. The sequence and stages will be  made clear in a week or 10 days time, and then the process will  begin. We have had a constant link with New York, and, no matter  what, the population will be provided with complete information.    The return of Abkhazia and the return to Abkhazia depends of  course on our joining the CIS, on engaging in new relations with  Russia, and these were purposeful and considered steps. This  also depends on our good relations with all states of the world,  including the permanent members of the UN Security Council.  These are the United States, England, France, our friend the  Federal Republic of Germany, and other countries that have been  supporting us. All this depends on close cooperation within the  UN framework. And this is a sign of the new order I have talked  about. All I said does not have anything to do with playing a  double game. Some people have fixed ideas, and they believe  that the only truth is what they think. Is it a double game to  begin establishing good relations with Russia, Ukraine, and  other neighboring countries and maintain good relations with the  West at the same time when they grant assistance in order to  relieve our major pain?    [Oniani] Two parties walked out of the council session last  week: the Republican Party and Merab Kostava Society. You also  did not attend Supreme Council sessions last week. Can we  interpret this as your boycotting the Supreme Council?    [Shevardnadze] And do you think that we had a preliminary  agreement? [both laugh] I can honestly say that walking out of  the Supreme Council is a very regrettable event by itself,  regardless of what group or what person does it. Those elected  by the people shall leave the council by the permission of the  people. Whatever the suffering and difficulties connected with  sitting there, one must be able to manage it.    As for my occasional absence from council sessions, this is  caused by urgent affairs, and I am sometimes forced to resort to  this sort of protest. I mean not to attend the council sessions  especially when I know that it means involvement in aimless  debates.    There have been demands that the post of head of state  should  be abolished, but, since we have already mentioned this topic, I  would say that I cannot imagine how we could survive without  this post at the present stage. Thus, no matter what we want,  we have to adapt to reality. We have to listen less to those  who are not in the know. For some of them, the worse the  better. Therefore, at the present stage, I reiterate, it is  fully justified to combine the posts of head of state and  chairman of the Supreme Council. I am convinced of this by my  own experience. And if I sometimes cannot be seen in the  Supreme Council, this should by no means be regarded as  disregard or disrespect toward the council. God forbid.    [Oniani] Georgia will be celebrating the 75th anniversary  of Tbilisi State University next week from 23 to 25 May. This is  an important occasion for our country. It was a deplorable  state of affairs in our science that you spoke about during your  meeting with the known financier and philanthropist George  Soros. How can the establishment of an independent,  international, social organization -- Georgia Open Social  Foundation -- help manage these processes?    [Shevardnadze] I believe that yesterday was a very important  day. Especially because it was close to the university  celebrations. The Soros Foundation is a very important and  serious international creation, and Mr. Soros himself is an  unbelievably interesting and very fruitful -- if you will, or  rather, efficient -- figure in the world. He has been doing  great things. [passage omitted] The foundation has already done  significant things for Georgia. It is probably not a very large  number, but 200 to 250 scientists have been practically  cooperating with the foundation. Many of them have received  grants from the foundations, and others are nominated to receive  them. Some young people are getting an education under the  sponsorship of the foundation in various countries. However,  since yesterday, since the opening of the center of the  foundation and its branch in Tbilisi, the activities will  acquire a more purposeful and planned character. [passage  omitted]    George Soros has an incredibly rich experience and a very  well ordered brain, if you will. I think some models we  discussed yesterday may be useful for us in order to overcome  the crisis even faster. We have reached very interesting ideas.  His recommendations are very original, and Georgia may even  become a basis for certain experimentation. I do not want to  exaggerate the significance of this conversation, but I would  say that it was a useful conversation from the conceptual point  of view. I have told him what the Georgian authorities are  intending to do regarding the coupon, the national currency, and  privatization.    I have been thinking long about the process of  privatization.  We have to deal with privatization of not only land but also  industry, construction, and trade, and I do not rule out that my  edict pertaining to this process -- to speeding up the process  -- will be issued very soon. [passage omitted]    [Oniani] Batono Eduard, the 26 May celebrations [Georgian  Independence Day] are coming this week. Notwithstanding various  contradictions and differences in the approach to this issue,  Georgia will be celebrating. Something is said to be prepared  for this day. Those who we often mention as certain forces,  because names of many of them are well known to the official  bodies who have to know, intend to do something, are preparing  more disturbances. How well is the population of the city  secured from this sort of a surprise, if you will?    [Shevardnadze] The 26 May holiday is a day of statehood. We  are heading in this direction, although at a speed slower than  desired. Opponents can say that there is no state, that the  state has disintegrated, and so on. This was the case two or  three years ago. The times were very hard. But now, the state  is being formed. [passage omitted] Party differences and  contradictions should not blind us. I do not think that any  party will attempt to torment the population on this day.    You said that there are rumors about some disturbances. I am  not sure what reports we have, but I do believe no one should  attempt to create new sources of instability in the capital city  on this day. All sound people have to this rule out. On the  contrary, everyone has to try to secure a demonstration of our  unity and integrity at least on this day. [passage omitted]    Speaking of rumors about some disturbances, I think everyone  will have sufficient prudence and sense of responsibility not to  repeat past errors. I want to reiterate that Georgia's  Independence Day and the university anniversary, which has been  planned to coincide with Independence Day -- and was therefore  shifted -- deserve being celebrated by all of us together so  that we all together demonstrate readiness to serve our country,  our state.

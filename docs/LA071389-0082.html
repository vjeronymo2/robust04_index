			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INDUSTRIAL POWER;  </P> <P> FRANCE AT 200: TRES MODERNE  </P> <P> Two hundred years ago this Friday, a mob of Parisians that included wine  merchants, cabinet makers, a brewer, a laundress and an 8-year-old boy sparked  the French Revolution by storming the Bastille Prison.  </P> <P> Today, the site is marked for eternity by a plaque above La Divine pizzeria in  the Place de la Bastille: "Seized by the people on July 14, 1789, and  demolished the same year."  </P> <P> For its part, the pizza parlor is getting into the spirit of things with a $50  special menu that concludes with "Bicentennial sherbet."  </P> <P> The French government, meanwhile, will combine its huge Bastille Day party this  year with the annual Group of Seven summit meeting. President Francois  Mitterrand hopes to dazzle the leaders from the world's leading industrial  democracies, including President Bush, with a stunning presentation of  futuristic architecture and a $15-million parade.  </P> <P> Tonight, the leaders are invited to the inaugural concert in the  glass-sheathed, $400-million Bastille Opera, the world's most technologically  advanced musical theater. On Friday, they meet to open the summit at the new  $300-million addition to the Louvre museum. On Saturday, they convene to  discuss the world economy in the new $500-million, marble-and-glass Arc de La  Defense that rises above a forest of skyscrapers on the edge of Paris in a  direct line with the Louvre and the Arc de Triomphe.  </P> <P> The message is clear: The Bourbon kings and the Napoleonic Age had their  monuments. We have ours. Move over, Ozymandias. Look on our works, ye mighty,  and . . . marvel.  </P> <P> The downtrodden postwar France of myth and movie -- represented by a  mustachioed man on a bicycle, wearing a beret and carrying a long loaf of bread  under his arm -- no longer exists. Neither does the mythical France of style  without substance, an elegant land of haute couture where the phones do not  work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tremendous Changes  </P> <P> "Many people," said Bernard Vernier-Palliez, a former French ambassador to the  United States, "still have the view of France that was based on the discoveries  made by the American GIs in 1944. To them, France was a country of good food  and les petites femmes, a highly cultured country but with really antiquated  industry and no high tech. They don't understand how tremendously France has  changed."  </P> <P> "The French are no longer French," Oxford University historian Theodore Zeldin  observed wryly in a recent interview.  </P> <P> Since World War II, few countries have advanced more rapidly and dramatically  than France. Until the first oil crisis in 1973, its postwar growth rate was  second only to Japan's. In 50 years, it has converted from a largely  agricultural nation where 45% of the population lived on farms to an industrial  and service economy where only 7% of the people still live in the countryside.  </P> <P> For 10 years after the oil crisis, from 1973 to 1983, French growth lagged  behind its European neighbors and the United States. But after the Socialist  government abandoned its experimentation with traditional leftist economic  policies in 1983, the economy has again been on the rebound.  </P> <P> Today, the French economy is second in Europe, nearly 80% the size of powerful  West Germany's and fifth in the world.  </P> <P> Sprawling French suburban developments are now barely distinguishable from  those in California or Texas, boasting giant shopping centers with McDonald's  and other fast-food outlets flanking the parking lots. One large French  retailer, Carrefour, has even started exporting its "hypermarkets" to the  United States, building a store in a Philadelphia suburb.  </P> <P> According to recent surveys, more French now buy their food from these  American-style markets than from the little shopkeepers with stained aprons  that figure so prominently in the standard image of France.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Naval, Nuclear Power  </P> <P> The new France is also an independent nuclear power with the world's  third-largest navy. France is a world leader in fusion and medical research,  computer software and weapons development.  </P> <P> It is also increasingly a multi-ethnic, multi-religious France.  </P> <P> Many new Frenchmen are named Mohammed or Sharif, speak Arabic as a first  language and live in the depressing suburban cites outside Paris, Marseilles or  Lyon. In predominantly North African Arab communities such as Les Minguettes  near Lyon, France faces major religious and ethnic divisions for the first time  in its long history of absorbing immigrants.  </P> <P> "It is an explosive situation," said Arezki Dahmani, an ethnic North African  economist who is president of an Arab political action organization, France  Plus. "We don't have the outbreaks of violence yet like you had in black  communities of the United States. But we are starting to have completely  isolated ghettos where unemployment is 80% and where generations are excluded  from French society."  </P> <P> With typical French eclat, the French government has attempted to attack this  emerging ethnic problem by spending millions on accelerated education programs  and job training programs in troubled areas like Les Minguettes.  </P> <P> Residents in the community say the programs are working. "Les Minguettes is  more beautiful than ever before," said an Arab teen-ager interviewed on a  recent afternoon as he stood next to an empty 14-story apartment building, one  of eight abandoned apartment towers in a section of the community named  Democracy Square.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Evocative of U.S. Failures  </P> <P> A few years ago the Democracy Square towers, so evocative of similar high-rise  failures in St. Louis and other American cities, were nests of crime and  despair. By moving families to less concentrated housing and increasing police  protection, the government was able to empty the towers without transferring  the problem to other parts of the community.  </P> <P> Sometime next month, in the context of the summer-long celebration of the  bicentennial of the French Revolution, the community plans to have demolition  experts implode the Democracy Square towers at the conclusion of a concert by  French jazz composer-musician Jean-Michel Jarre.  </P> <P> Perhaps the most dramatic change in France has been the evolution in French  attitudes toward money and making money.  </P> <P> "The most interesting change," said Prof. Stanley Hoffmann, chairman of Harvard  University's Center of European Studies, "is the transformation of the French  business community, which previously was so terribly uncompetitive, anti-social  and elitist."  </P> <P> Bernard Vernier-Palliez said he first noticed the huge change in his country  when he returned home in 1984, after his three years as French ambassador to  the United States.  </P> <P> "I had never spent such a continuous period away from France before," the  retired diplomat and former chief executive of the Renault automobile company  recalled. "Coming back, can you imagine my shock when I found a country that  had completely changed? Contrary to what was in fashion in the late 1970s, free  enterprise had become something absolutely important."  </P> <P> Vernier-Palliez was amazed to find that flashy businessman Bernard Tapie had  become a hero to the French people. Tapie is a square-jawed, self-made Parisian  </P> <P> millionaire who never saw the inside of one of the half a dozen elite schools  that are the usual incubators for the French establishment.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Father Was a Mechanic  </P> <P> Tapie proudly points out that his grandmother was a maid in a school. His  father was a mechanic.  </P> <P> His rags-to-riches autobiography, "To Win," was a runaway best seller. So were  the romans fric -- cash novels -- of French author Paul Loup Sulitzer, complete  with their brash English titles: "Money" (1983), "Cash" (1983) and "Fortune"  (1984). The foreign best-seller list was headed by Chrysler executive Lee  Iacocca's celebrated autobiography, which French Left Bank intellectuals began  to discuss with the solemnity and respect previously reserved for the works of  William Faulkner or James Baldwin.  </P> <P> Nearly a century after Americans embraced the same thing, La Belle France -- a  solidly Roman Catholic country where striving for money was considered sinful  and where ambition was to land a safe job with one of the giant state  industries -- was having a torrid love affair with Horatio Alger.  </P> <P> All of a sudden, wrote French sociologist Gerard Mermet in his 1989 book on  French social trends, "money doesn't smell bad any more."  </P> <P> "To have an entrepreneur as a hero was something unimaginable before,"  Vernier-Palliez said.  </P> <P> "In another time," agreed Tapie, who recently began a political career after  his lopsided election to the French Parliament from a working-class quarter of  Marseilles, "it would not have been possible for me to become famous."  </P> <P> Open-shirted, tough-talking Tapie is a polar opposite to button-down, refined  Vernier-Palliez. Tapie hosted a television show entitled "Ambition."  </P> <P> In Vernier-Palliez's world, ambition, like money, was something seldom  mentioned aloud. Ambition was vulgar. It smacked of competition, obsession and  greed, things the French usually prefer to pursue in private.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Changes at Schools  </P> <P> No wonder the returning diplomat was stunned when he saw what had happened at  his distinguished alma mater, Les Hautes Etudes Commerciales (HEC), from which  he graduated in 1937. HEC is one of the half a dozen grandes ecoles that have  traditionally produced the French elite. In the past, mere acceptance at HEC  meant a guaranteed comfortable future in business or government, usually with  one of the huge, state-owned industries such as Renault.  </P> <P> Upon his return, however, Vernier-Palliez discovered that a new "entrepreneur  section" had been created at the school for students who wanted to bypass the  guaranteed job track and create their own business. The first assignment for  students in the new section is to parachute out of an airplane -- a test of  courage and a measure of their willingness to confront the unknown.  </P> <P> Some of the students, like 22-year-old Anne-Sophie Maisonrouge, paralyzed with  fear, had to be pushed out of the airplane by their instructors.  </P> <P> "But he pushed me too far, and I landed in a field with a bull. Then I was  really scared," Maisonrouge, now a graduate of HEC, recalled recently.  </P> <P> Most astonishing to many Americans and other visitors who come to France are  the major technological advances that have arrived here. Only a few years ago,  the French telephone system was one of the worst in Western Europe. French  comedian Fernand Reynaud had a whole routine based on the telephone, which  always included the line of how it was easier to telephone faraway New York  than the "22 exchange" in the Paris suburb of Asnieres.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Computer Mania  </P> <P> Today, the Reynaud routine would fall flat. France has one of the best phone  systems in the world and is a leader in fiber-optics communications. It is also  the home of the astonishing minitel, small computer terminals distributed free  by the French national telephone company.  </P> <P> "When France makes up her mind to change," Harvard's Hoffmann said, "it can  happen very, very fast."  </P> <P> Hoffmann, who was born in Vienna and raised in France, likes to tell the story  of his return to Boston after a year's sabbatical in Paris during 1983-84.  </P> <P> "People asked my impressions of the difference between living in the States and  living in France," he said. "I told them that public services and practically  everything else worked better in France -- even the phones."  </P> <P> According to France Telecom, more than 4.5 million of the bread-box-size  minitel terminals have been installed in French households since 1984. In  addition to educating entire families in basic computer use, the minitels  permit the French to order groceries, make train reservations, buy opera  tickets, monitor news developments, play dozens of video games, hail taxis,  check schedules, leave messages and even have erotic electronic conversations,  as well as a dizzying array of other options that multiply nearly every day.  </P> <P> France is also the land of the world's fastest passenger trains, the trains a  grande vitesse (TGV), that have revolutionized European rail travel and made  trains competitive with airplanes. The trains are comfortable and remarkably  smooth, powered by electricity produced from France's 50 nuclear power plants.  </P> <P> Riding the TGV, a businessman can travel from the center of Paris to the center  of Lyon, a distance of 270 miles, in two hours -- less time than it would take  him to drive to a Paris airport, hop an airplane and drive into the center of  Lyon. The high-speed trains have become a major factor in decentralizing  France.  </P> <P> "There has been a significant revival of provincial life," Hoffmann said.  "Paris is still Paris, but it doesn't pump the rest of France the way it used  to."  </P> <P> In the fall, the French state railroad company will launch its new Atlantic  line with trains that travel at more than 180 miles per hour on a route that  will eventually hook up with Nantes, capital of Brittany.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Dream of European Network  </P> <P> In the future, French engineers dream of wrapping all of Western Europe in a  network of high-speed rail lines that will propel passengers from Paris to  London, for example, in only three hours by 1993.  </P> <P> In aviation and aerospace, French companies hold 58% interest in the European  satellite launching consortium Ariane. Ariane, using a rocket that is a  generation ahead of its American counterparts, recently surpassed its goal of  capturing more than 50% of the world market. At the beginning of June, Ariane  had orders to launch 34 satellites, worth nearly $2.5 billion in revenue.  </P> <P> France has also been the major mover behind the European Airbus Industries,  which has emerged as the major direct competition for the American giant  Boeing. French engineers developed the "fly by wire" guidance system safe  enough for commercial aircraft, solving a problem that had eluded American  engineers for decades.  </P> <P> Mostly because of Airbus, which has orders or commitments for more than 800  aircraft lasting well into the next century, Toulouse, a charming,  Spanish-flavored town in southwest France's Garonne Valley, has become the  undisputed aerospace capital of Europe, populated by one of the world's densest  concentrations of scientists and engineers.  </P> <P> Despite the impressive technological achievements in this country of 55.6  million people, the general image of France remains rooted in the past.  </P> <P> A Gallup International poll conducted for the Franco-American Foundation in  1986 showed that only 30% of Americans considered France "among the leading  industrial countries in the world." Only 21% of the 1,006 Americans contacted  for telephone interviews considered France a "serious competitor of the United  States" in aerospace. Only 20% of the Americans considered France a country  with "a strong nuclear force of its own."  </P> <P> To many foreigners, particularly Americans, France is a mainly rural land of  good food, fine perfume and rude waiters.  </P> <P> "Americans still think of France as an agricultural land that knows how to  produce wine, Camembert cheese and not much else," said Jacques Maisonrouge,  64, a French engineer who was the first foreigner to sit on the board of  directors and the top management committee of IBM. He is also the father of  reluctant parachutist Anne-Sophie.  </P> <P> "They don't know that France is second behind the United States in the  development of computer software," he continued. "They don't know about our  airplanes and our medical research. Behind the U.S., France is the  second-ranked developer of new molecules for drugs."  </P> <P> Entrepreneur Tapie fumed in an animated interview at his Paris headquarters:  "Americans take us for complete fools. They still imagine us with a baguette of  bread under our arm, slippers on our feet and Camembert in our string bags."  </P> <P> "The image people have is very old," said Oxford's Zeldin, author of an  extensive series of books on modern French history and considered, even in  France, one of the premier foreign interpreters of French life.  </P> <P> "The French feel underestimated, devalued," Zeldin said. "I think it is the  main reason for the reputation they have for being difficult. They would not be  so difficult if they felt they were being understood.  </P> <P> "The greatest enemies to France," he continued, "are those Francophiles who  want to keep the French petrified as they were in the 1920s or 1930s, to love  them as sort of historical monuments. Indeed, the Francophiles resent it if you  even talk about the future because they feel you are denying that aspect of  France with which they had grown up, which represented their youth -- and which  they don't want to change."  </P></p>

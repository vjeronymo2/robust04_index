			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> COLD WAR THINKING IS CHANGING;  </P> <P> GORBACHEV OUTPOLLS BUSH IN ORANGE COUNTY SURVEY  </P> <P> Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev is rated more favorably than President Bush in  largely Republican Orange County, which handed Bush and Ronald Reagan their  greatest margins of victory of any county in the nation in the last three  presidential elections.  </P> <P> In this bellwether conservative region, The Los Angeles Times Orange County  Poll has found signs of new thinking on both foreign and domestic issues.  Nearly half the people believe that the Cold War is coming to an end and that  Japan and the Third World are greater threats to the United States' future than  the Soviet Union or China. Twice as many people favor decreasing the U.S.  military presence overseas as favor an expanded role.  </P> <P> Leading Republican consultant Stu Spencer, a longtime Reagan adviser, sees such  Orange County attitudes as part of a national trend: "The message is that  Orange County is more in the mainstream of American thinking than the  perception. Thinking on the Cold War undoubtedly is changing due to Ronald  Reagan's policies. His handling of the Soviets has an 80% national approval  rate with only 8% negative.  </P> <P> "So a conservative leader's accomplishments have affected conservatives at  home," said Spencer, whose office is in Irvine. "Sure there's a shift. You can  prove there's a shift by the numbers -- these numbers are in line with what I  expected."  </P> <P> The results of the Times poll underscore the dilemma Bush faces this week as he  officially begins work in the Oval Office. Sunday, for example, Brent  Scowcroft, the new President's national security adviser, declared flatly that  "the Cold War is not over" and he expressed skepticism about what he termed  Gorbachev's "peace offensive."  </P> <P> If, as Spencer believes, national conservative thinking on the Soviets is  shifting under the influence of Reagan's policies, Bush may face as great a  difficulty with this important domestic constituency as his Administration  apparently believes that it does with the Western European allies. Scowcroft  said Sunday that one of Bush's first foreign policy priorities would be to  persuade the Europeans not be be blinded by "wishful thinking" about Soviet  intentions.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Conservative Social Agenda  </P> <P> Responses among Orange County residents also suggest that Bush will have  something less than overwhelming backing if he attempts to act on his  conservative social agenda. On Monday, for example, the President telephoned a  message of support to anti-abortion protesters rallying to mark the 16th  anniversary of the Supreme Court's historic ruling in Roe vs. Wade.  </P> <P> However, fully 60% of the Orange County residents polled oppose a Supreme Court  ruling that would outlaw abortion. By an almost 3-1 margin, Orange County  residents also reject further cuts in federal social and health programs as a  means of reducing the national deficit.  </P> <P> In the realm of family values, a majority (56%) oppose a ban on the rental of  X-rated videos in their community. And a stunning 82% favor educating  adolescents in public schools about the use of condoms to control the spread of  AIDS.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Differences With Leadership  </P> <P> "I am too young to be too conservative" is the way one of those polled, Alex  Ball, explained his differences with the GOP's leadership on the so-called  social issues. Ball, a 28-year-old Republican, did volunteer work for Reagan in  1980 and 1984.  </P> <P> "I can understand Reagan's views on moral values, but he's 77 years old and a  bit out of touch. It's just not practical to ban abortions, and if they do, a  lot of people will have regrets later," remarked Ball, who said he voted for  Bush "largely on the economic and foreign policy issues."  </P> <P> On both domestic and foreign policy issues, there was not much difference in  the attitudes of the county's Republicans and Democrats. Gorbachev's rating was  as high among Republicans (73%) as among Democrats (72%). Slightly more  Republicans (47%) believe that the Cold War might be coming to an end as  compared to Democrats (44%).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Margin of Error  </P> <P> The Times Orange County Poll of 600 adult residents was conducted Jan. 13-17 by  Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine. The poll has a margin of error of  plus or minus 4%.  </P> <P> Top Republican pollster Richard B. Wirthlin, who conducted President Reagan's  public opinion research, said: "The findings of the Times poll reflect changes  in the political and demographic makeup of Orange County. But more important,  they are consistent with what I find nationally, which is a tremendous change  in attitude.  </P> <P> "The Cold War generated a lot of worry and concern about the Soviet threat. It  is dramatically lower than during any time in the past 20 years. During the  Cold War period, the feeling that the Soviet threat was the most important  problem facing the United States ranged between 25% and 50%. In my poll, which  we've been conducing for 15 years, it is at an all-time low of 8%."  </P> <P> A majority of Republicans (53%) said they oppose a ban on X-rated movies in  their local community video store, favor teaching about condoms (76%) and  oppose a new California law that requires schools to teach that abstinence is  the only acceptable form of premarital birth control (55%).  </P> <P> "A lot of people here are liberal on top of their conservative foundation,"  observed one of those polled, Irvine artist-designer Tom Kellog, a Republican  who opposes a ban on abortions or X-rated videos.  </P> <P> In fact, Republican pollsters previously have documented a libertarian streak  in conservative Republican ideology. They see this insistence on individual  rights as a natural adjunct to the conservative belief in limited government  intervention in all social spheres.  </P> <P> "The tendency has been for hard-core Republicans to look at things in a  libertarian manner," GOP consultant Spencer said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Much More Broad-Minded'  </P> <P> "The perception of the Republican voters of Orange County has always been too  simplistic. As the Times polling data shows, they are much more broad-minded in  some areas then people give them credit."  </P> <P> For instance, despite yearlong hearings conducted by Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese's  commission on the possible adverse social effects of pornography, 47% of those  Orange County residents who labeled themselves conservatives oppose a ban on  the rental of "adult X-rated movies" in their community, while 43% favor such a  ban. And 50% of conservatives oppose the new state law requiring teaching  abstinence as the only acceptable form of birth control. Conservatives are  evenly split on the abortion issue, but 78% "favor educating adolescents in  public schools about the use of condoms as a means of controlling the spread of  AIDS."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fundamentalists Divided  </P> <P> The poll indicates that it would be simplistic to think of the religious  fundamentalist community as being united on social issues. One-third of those  interviewed identified themselves as religious fundamentalists, meaning  "someone who takes the Bible literally on issues such as the creation of life."  </P> <P> But in this group, 44% oppose the requirement on teaching abstinence and 44%  approve, and 73% favor education about condoms in connection with AIDS. And 47%  of the fundamentalists oppose a ban on X-rated video rentals, while 45% favor  it.  </P> <P> On the issue of abortion, whereas non-fundamentalists strongly "oppose having  the Supreme Court outlaw abortions except in the case of a threat to the  mother's life," a majority of fundamentalists (52%) favor such a ban, while 41%  of this group oppose such a prohibition.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Civil Liberties Orientation'  </P> <P> "Orange County residents have traditionally shown a civil liberties orientation  about personal life-style issues," said Baldassare, who is a UC Irvine  professor. "But at the point at which civil liberty conflicts with a strong law  and order (issue), as with the issue of drugs, their attitude swings toward  stronger authority."  </P> <P> A strong law-and-order stance on drugs coincides with residents' belief that  drugs are the biggest problem facing young people, although twice as many  believe that alcohol abuse is a bigger problem than drugs for adults. The  federal government's so-called "zero-tolerance policy" of seizing boats and  cars in which a small amount of marijuana is found was favored by 51%, with 42%  opposed.  </P> <P> Gorbachev's 70% favorable rating was accompanied by a low 15% unfavorable, even  lower than Reagan's at 18%. Bush had a 67% favorable rating, with 17%  unfavorable. Reagan topped Gorbachev with 76% favorable and British Prime  Minister Margaret Thatcher won the sweepstakes with 79% favorable and 11%  unfavorable.  </P> <P> Yitzhak Shamir, the Israeli prime minister, is less well known to Orange County  residents, many of whom declined to state a view of him. Of those who did, 21%  had a favorable impression and 35% unfavorable.  </P> <P> Republican candidates in each of the last three presidential elections have  carried Orange County by the largest margin of any county nationwide. In 1980,  Reagan's margin over Jimmy Carter in the county was 353,000 votes. It rose to  428,000 over Walter F. Mondale in 1984. Bush defeated Michael S. Dukakis by  314,000 votes in the last election.  </P> <P> </P> <P> HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TIMES ORANGE COUNTY POLL  </P> <P> Findings of the The Times' Orange County Poll of 600 adult residents, which was  conducted Jan. 13-17 by Mark Baldassare &amp; Associates of Irvine.

			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Escondida has backing for Dollars 284m expansion A USDollars 284m expansion of Escondida in Chile, already the world's second largest copper mine, has been given the go-ahead by government lending agencies in Finland, Germany and Japan, which provided most of the money for its start-up at the end of 1990. The expansion will increase Escondida's output by half and will play a key role in Chile's drive to add value to its copper riches. Part of the expansion involves a unique method of producing copper cathodes, which will give Escondida and Chile 80,000 tonnes of copper metal a year after production begins in August 1994. Also, some of the extra concentrate (an intermediate material) from Escondida will go to feed a new smelter being put into service this year by Refimet, a Chilean company, which will produce 75,000 tonnes of copper metal annually, and the Enami smelter which is being expanded. This means that from 1994 about 25 per cent of the Escondida concentrate will be upgraded to metal in Chile. Today none of it is. Escondida is owned by BHP of Australia (57.5 per cent), RTZ of the UK (30 per cent), a Japanese consortium led by Mitsubishi (10 per cent) and the International Finance Corporation (2.5 per cent). The company signed 12-year supply contracts with smelters in Finland, Germany and Japan as part of the financing package and government lending agencies in those countries loaned about 60 per cent of the Dollars 824m needed to get the mine, 3,000 metres up in the Atacama desert, into operation. It was the biggest single foreign investment in Chile's history. As senior lenders, the agencies had to give unanimous approval for the expansion, which will be funded from Escondida's cash flow. The expansion will take output from 390,000 tonnes this year to 420,000 in 1994 and 480,000 in 1995. A substantial portion of the increased output will come from a Dollars 164m solvent extraction electrowinning cathode plant to be built near some of Escondida's existing operations at the port of Coloso, 14km kilometres from Antofagasta. This will use hydrometalurgical technology, patented by Escondida and developed in BHP's California laboratories, which uses ammonia to leach copper out of the ore, producing the purest copper in the world, 99.999 per cent pure. This technology works only with certain types of ore but is particularly effective with Escondida's. Mr Steve Kesler, manager of planning and business development, said Escondida would be willing to consider making the technology available to other producers. He said the expansion would increase productivity as it would add only 200 to Escondida's present workforce of 960 and annual output per employee would rise from 320 tonnes to 380 tonnes. Mr Kesler said hectic activity by copper companies in northern Chile had encouraged two new coal burning power stations to be built in the region and once Escondida had the benefit both of lower power costs and economies of scale from the expansion, operating costs in real terms would drop 20 per cent by 1995. Escondida does not reveal its operating costs but some observers estimate them at below 50 cents a lb. One indication of Escondida's profitability is that RTZ reported that net attributable earnings from the mine last year were Pounds 41m, up from Pounds 30m. Mr Kesler said the recent sudden drop in copper's price had not deterred the owners from pushing ahead with the expansion. 'At 80 cents a lb we can meet all operating, capital and debt repayment commitments,' he said. While customers with long term supply contracts would not increase their purchases from Escondida, new customers had been lining up in Poland, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Spain and Sweden, attracted by the mine's clean, high-quality concentrate. Other elements in the expansion include an increase in mining capacity by the purchase of one of the world's biggest mechanical shovels, which can lift fifty cubic yards with one scoop and costs Dollars 9.5m, and twelve haul trucks at Dollars 1.7m each. Expansion of milling capacity will cost Dollars 83m.</p>

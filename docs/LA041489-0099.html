			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE DREXEL SETTLEMENT;  </P> <P> DREXEL DOESN'T EXPECT DEAL TO HURT ITS 'JUNK BOND' UNIT  </P> <P> Drexel Burnham Lambert's lucrative high-yield "junk bond" department in Beverly  Hills must undergo several notable managerial and policy changes -- including  the firing of junk bond impresario Michael Milken -- following the firm's  settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  </P> <P> But the unit that generates as much as half of Drexel's profit and made the  firm a Wall Street giant will be allowed to stay in Beverly Hills. And its  basic ability to conduct trading and other activities are not expected to be  significantly hindered, company officials and industry observers said Thursday.  </P> <P> "This should have no material effect on their ability to distribute high-yield  securities," said Marshall V. Davidson, a former managing director at Drexel  who now holds a similar title at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.  </P> <P> "We've structured the settlement in such a way to enable us to continue to  function efficiently and close to normal, if not better than that," Drexel  spokesman Steven Anreder said.  </P> <P> The key victory for Drexel was winning the SEC's consent to let the junk bond  department stay in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> While there is no reason the firm couldn't trade junk bonds out of New York,  the firm was concerned that many of its key people in Beverly Hills -- with  their families and lives settled in Southern California -- would not have  wanted to move east. Milken moved the department to Southern California in  1977.  </P> <P> Accordingly, Drexel mounted a lobbying effort, including pleas from key  California legislators and clients, to persuade the SEC to allow the junk bond  unit to stay put.  </P> <P> The Beverly Hills operation must, however, undertake several key measures to  tighten oversight and separate certain functions to reduce potential for abuse.  Among the changes:  </P> <P> * Drexel can no longer employ or do business with Milken, its longtime junk  bond chief, who is singularly responsible for transforming Drexel from a Wall  Street doormat in the 1970s to a powerhouse in the 1980s.  </P> <P> Industry opinion is mixed on how well Drexel can retain its market share in  junk bonds in the post-Milken era. But without Milken, the firm earlier this  year pulled off the major part of the biggest junk bond financing in history  for the takeover of RJR Nabisco. And one thing is agreed: The firm is loaded  with highly talented traders and investment bankers.  </P> <P> * A new Capital Markets Services Department will be created, separate from the  junk bond unit, to minimize potential insider trading, market manipulation or  other abuses. That department will be headed by Peter Ackerman, a skilled deal  maker and Milken's former right-hand man.  </P> <P> Ackerman's department, however, will still work closely with the junk bond  unit, designing, pricing and marketing new junk bond issues and developing and  maintaining relationships with investment banking clients.  </P> <P> * Drexel will transfer equity and convertible securities trading activities in  Beverly Hills to New York. Previously part of the high-yield department, those  functions are not seen as critical to junk bond trading. The bulk of Drexel's  equity trading was already based in New York anyway. Only about 20 employees  will be affected and many, if not all, may remain in Beverly Hills and join the  junk bond department, Drexel spokesman Anreder said.  </P> <P> * An unnamed member of Drexel's executive committee, acceptable to the SEC,  will reside in the Los Angeles area and supervise the Beverly Hills operation  -- including junk bonds, capital markets services and corporate finance.  Previously no individual held that role, although John H. Kissick, acting chief  of the junk bond department since March and highest ranking official in Beverly  Hills, is a member of Drexel's board.  </P> <P> Drexel also must take other steps to boost oversight, including the posting of  at least three compliance officers in the junk bond unit, reporting to Drexel's  compliance director in New York.  </P> <P> MAIN STORY: Part I, Page 1  </P></p>

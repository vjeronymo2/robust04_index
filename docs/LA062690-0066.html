			<p><P> June 26, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UTEP COACH HASKINS DENIES SCHOOL GAVE STAGGERS MONEY, TRANSPORTATION  </P> <P> Basketball coach Don Haskins of Texas El Paso has angrily denied allegations by  a former recruit that UTEP coaches gave the player money, housing and  transportation.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles Times reported Saturday that John Staggers, a former Crenshaw  High star, had told the NCAA that he received such favors in 1988.  </P> <P> The NCAA has been investigating UTEP's basketball program for six months.  </P> <P> Staggers said that he told the NCAA that UTEP had furnished him with a place to  live, transportation and meals during a six-week stay in El Paso in the summer  of 1988. Staggers also implicated UTEP assistants Rus Bradburd, now at Ball  State, and G Ray Johnson.  </P> <P> Haskins has called a news conference for this morning to discuss the situation.  </P> <P> "We've done nothing illegal," Haskins said. "This is the first I've heard of  anything like this. But I've been in constant contact with my assistant  coaches.  </P> <P> "You know," Haskins added, "had John Staggers passed his GED (General  Equivalency Diploma test), I think the NCAA would be a lot more concerned we'd  done something illegal."  </P></p>

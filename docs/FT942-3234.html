			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (2): Enhanced services on the way - Cellular Telephony Three significant trends are evident in the cellular mobile industry across the developed world: First, the tentative entry of the mobile phone into the consumer market. Second, the rise of competition between rival operators within countries. And third, the migration from analogue to digital networks offering greater capacity, enhanced features, improved reliability, and the capacity to 'roam' across national borders. Yet the three are not moving in tandem. The UK has four network operators up and running, with nearly four subscribers per one hundred people. Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands still have only one functioning operator apiece - in all cases the monopoly national telecoms company - with two or fewer subscribers per one hundred people. Even the UK appears a backwater by the standards of the United States, which has six subscribers per one hundred people and is about to boost its already fierce mobile competition by auctioning a host of new Personal Communications Systems (PCS) licences. Last year's Dollars 13bn takeover of McCaw Communications by the US giant AT&amp;T marks a decisive turning point, giving a significant impetus to the development of cellular telecommunications and their integration with fixed-wire networks. The past year has seen the more mature markets - the US and western Europe - grow at roughly similar rates. Growth has been much faster in eastern European, Latin American and Asia-Pacific regions, but in all cases from a lower base. According to FT newsletter, Mobile Communications, 1993 saw the North American market grow 43 per cent to 17.3m and western Europe grow 47 per cent to 8.8m. By contrast, eastern Europe grew 129 per cent (but still only to 110,000), while Malaysia grew by 64 per cent, Argentina by 220 per cent, and China by 300 per cent - to select from the other regions. China, however, still has barely 700,000 subscribers for 1bn people - fewer than Sweden, and only three times more than Switzerland. Nonetheless, even in the west the mobile phone still has a long way to go before it becomes a standard business item, let alone a mass consumer product. For all the talk of mobile networks competing with, or replacing, fixed networks, the virtually no organisations of any size make universal provision for their employees to have cellular phones. In the most populous mobile nations, the best analogy for the present state of the mobile phone market is that of a thin sandwich in search of a thick filling. Two thin slices of the business market are currently being serviced  -namely senior executives on the one hand, and travelling sales people plus the self-employed 'roamers' (plumbers, electricians, and so on), on the other. In between, lies a mass of the employed who get no closer to a mobile phone that overhearing banal conversations on the train home. Typically, a company will have a handful of mobiles available for staff on the move - but no policy of progressively extending their use. Henceforth, cellular phones can probably be expected to penetrate both the business and the consumer sectors in parallel, the one re-inforcing the other against a backdrop of progressively - but not precipitately - falling tariffs. Price reductions will owe something to technological advance; something to competition between operators; and something to cultural attitudes, which at some point are bound to make that the mobile phone as essential as the fridge. That time may come fairly soon, if the progress of the UK market over the past year is any guide. In the UK, tariffs have been falling fast. After eight years when Cellnet and Vodafone, the two original operators, levied largely unchanged and almost identical tariffs, the past year has seen successive price cuts and a growing diversity of tariff packages. Eighteen months ago the two operators began tapping the low-use market, with low subscription but high usage charges. Last summer the imminent launch of the Mercury One-2-One network in the London region obliged them first to drop their London tariff premium, then to introduce special discounts for users in the London region. The effect was dramatic. At the start of 1993, the business user had to pay 33p a minute for daytime calls in the London region. By the year-end that had dropped to 20p for those on new London tariff packages - though calls outside the region cost more on the tariff. One-2-One charged business customers 16p a minute, and 8p after 9pm and at weekends. (One-2-One caused a stir in the industry by offering free local calls on weekday evenings and at weekends, but only on a consumer tariff of little use to the typical business customer). The launch of a fourth network operator - Orange, owned by Hutchison Microtel - in April this year has not had a similar impact on tariffs. But the Orange strategy shows a sophistication in its approach to the business sector which may also boost the market. Orange's tariffs feature minutes of 'free' calls bundled in with the monthly subscription. The various packages include between 15 and 540 minutes of free calls. Cleverly, most of them bundle in more minutes than the average business customer currently uses - ie between 150 and 200 minutes - but for a price below the equivalent for the same calls at peak rate on existing Vodafone and Cellnet networks, if paid for on a usage basis. The tariff structure is clearly designed with the company telecoms manager and small businessman in mind. Meanwhile, handset prices are also coming down rapidly. It is now possible to get slim-line phones for the UK's analogue networks for under Pounds 100. Phones for new digital networks are more expensive, but Mercury One-2-One cut the price of its digital phones - compatible with those for the Orange network - by Pounds 50 in the run-up to the Orange launch, taking the cheapest to Pounds 170. In Germany and Denmark, Motorola handsets for the digital GSM networks have fallen to under Pounds 100 in some promotion packages. Enhanced services are also on the way. Orange's Nokia handsets double as radio pagers and have screens which can display messages. Each handset can support two telephone lines distinguished by different ringing tones. Their batteries support more than an hour's continuous conversation. Meanwhile, other operators are exploring the potential for integrating fixed and mobile services as a means of boosting their business appeal. Full integration with BT's fixed-wire service is prohibited by Cellnet's licence, but possible departures include software enabling PABXs to switch calls to employees' mobile phones automatically, and switching enhancements for virtual private networks enabling calls to be passed to mobile networks without incurring fixed-line costs. The relationship between fixed and mobile networks lies at the heart of future growth. On the one hand, regulatory authorities on both sides of the Atlantic have been keen to keep fixed and mobile networks separate, to prevent dominant (often monopoly) fixed-line operators from cross-subsiding their (competitive) mobile operations. AT&amp;T has had to go some way to meeting this requirement in its take-over of McCaw, to appease the Federal Communications Commission. On the other hand, the future must lie in convergence - particularly as 'personal numbers' and 'intelligent networks' divorces phone numbers from particular handsets. Tellingly, the European Commission's Green Paper on Mobile Communications, published in April, calls for the 'unrestricted' combined offering of services across fixed and mobile networks within the overall time schedule for the liberalisation of fixed-wire voice services across the European Union - ie by 1998 for most of the 12 member-states. In other words, as fixed-line monopolies wither, convergence with mobile communications will be allowed to proceed. Given the speed of the withering, the all-in cellular and fixed-wire package may be just round the corner - for businesses and consumers.

However, the figure for western Europe alone rose by a million in the first three months of this year. The cellular population in western Europe grew by 47 per cent last year, rising to 8.8m at the end of 1993. The north American market grew by 43 per cent last year, rising to 17.3m from 12.1m. The fastest-growing cellular markets are in Asia - China experienced the highest growth-rate, rising by more than 300 per cent from 160,000 subscribers at the end of 1992 to 644,000 subscribers a year later.

			<p>920825 FT  25 AUG 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report The dollar's plunge to successive lows against the D-mark pushed GOLD higher on the London bullion market, but the gains were limited by reported producer selling on Comex and the sharp losses over the past two weeks. Some short covering emerged after a large early buying order in Europe, but dealers said gold's attraction as a safe haven from the collapsing dollar was dented by the recent sell-off by US funds, and capital was mainly moving to the Swiss franc.  The turmoil in the currency markets kept BASE METAL trading on the LME quiet as traders tried to keep their exposure to a minimum. 'Investors won't commit themselves while there is the danger a sudden currency move will wipe out a profit or trigger a stop loss order within seconds,' one trader said. Overall dollar metal prices moved higher and sterling quotations eased. New York COTTON futures remained sharply up at midday amid concerns of unfavourable weather for the Delta from Hurricane Andrew which is heading toward the Gulf of Mexico. Fears that the hurricane might damage Louisiana and Florida SUGAR prices kept the New York futures market firm. Compiled from Reuters</p>

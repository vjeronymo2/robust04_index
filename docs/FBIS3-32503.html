			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Juan Carlos Tellechea] </F>   [Text] Dresden, 4 Feb (DPA) -- Ricardo Alarcon, president  of the Cuban National Assembly who is in this city today at the  end of his official three-day visit to Germany, has said that  U.S. President Bill Clinton has moderated the policy on Cuba  that the George Bush administration handed down to Clinton  through the Torricelli Law.    After expressing to his German hosts measured optimism about  the possibility of the U.S. embargo against Cuba being eased  during the latter half of Clinton's current term, or his second  term should he be reelected, Alarcon told DPA that Havana has  observed Washington becoming more flexible in the practical  enforcement of the strict embargo.    Alarcon, a former foreign minister and deputy foreign  minister, was until today guest of Rita Sussmuth, president of  the German Federal Parliament (Bundestag). Alarcon met with  representatives of the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl,  federal deputies, and members of the regional parliaments of  Bremen and Saxony in the former East Germany.    Alarcon believes an eventual easing of the U.S. embargo  against Cuba, which has lasted more than three decades, can take  place in Clinton's second term, because the issue is still too  heavily loaded, ideologically speaking, and the U.S.  Administration still does not have enough latitude to make a  political decision of this nature.    Alarcon, who did not conceal from his hosts Cuba's interest  in the current PRC model of evolution toward political  liberalization by way of cautious economic reforms, nevertheless  said that so far there has been no direct official contact  between the U.S. and Cuban governments. [sentence as received]    According to Alarcon, Havana observes "the U.S. Government's  language is changing." For example, Cuban authorities have  taken notice of "a reiterated statement by the U.S. State  Department and Assistant Secretary of State Watson, saying that  U.S. territory will not be permitted to be used for terrorist  activities or violence against Cuba."    Alarcon said: "This is what the American Neutrality Act  states, and this is normal in international law. But the United  States never said this during the past 12 years of Republican  administrations. This is something we cannot overlook."    He added that "the U.S. Government's position during the  neuritis epidemic in Cuba" must also be considered in this  regard. Washington "did not object to several U.S. scientists  from National Institute of Health traveling to Cuba." The U.S.  scientists "cooperated with Cuban authorities and made very  unbiased remarks about Cuba when they concluded their work."  The experts "returned to the United States, but kept in touch  with Cuban researchers. The reason for this is still being  discussed and pondered. It is interesting to note this, because  the neuritis epidemic can occur elsewhere."    Alarcon declined to comment on the lifting of the U.S.  embargo on Vietnam after 20 years. He also elected not to imply  that he can base his moderate optimism concerning Cuban-U.S.  relations on this decision.    The Clinton era represents for the United States a great  leap  ahead, since the generation that served in World War II and  experienced "McCarthyism" until the time of the young men who  either fought or refused to enlist in the Vietnam war. [sentence  as received]    The personalities who were active during the administrations  of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson have disappeared or  retired, while some who belonged to Jimmy Carter's time are  still alive. Nevertheless, most members of the Clinton team are  much younger people, unrelated to active politics since they  were in the opposition during the quarter century of the  Republican Party's several terms in the White House -- since  Richard Nixon in 1968.    All this can explain to Cuban authorities the whys and  wherefores of the transformations under way today in the United  States, and why the Clinton administration has established a  policy allowing women and Hispanics to hold positions of  responsibility.</p>

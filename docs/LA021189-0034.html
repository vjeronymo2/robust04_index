			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INVISIBLE WOMEN, BLIND MEN;  </P> <P> BARBARA TUCHMAN WAS SEEN WHERE IT COUNTED  </P> <P> "If a man is a writer," Barbara Tuchman once said, "everybody tiptoes around  past the locked door of the breadwinner. But if you're an ordinary female  housewife, people say, 'This is just something Barbara wanted to do; it's not  professional.' "  </P> <P> When she died Monday, Barbara W. Tuchman had won two Pulitzer Prizes and had,  at the age of 77, yet another book, "The First Salute" on the best-seller  lists. But Tuchman was still very much a part of the locked-door theory of  education and knowledge. She didn't have a Ph.D. She had used that time slot in  her early life to marry a nice man and produce three children. By this harmless  (some might even say productive) activity, she had rendered herself invisible  to the history Establishment. She worked steadily, did reams of research, wrote  marvelously readable books, but the more she did, the more "they," the guys  inside the ivy-covered walls, couldn't/wouldn't see her. . . .  </P> <P> Well, it's nothing new. In 1928, beside herself with exasperation, Virginia  Woolf lectured about the locked doors of the university system. She conjured up  the fictional university of "Oxbridge," where women might hang around on the  margins of things but still might not take a degree. She railed at male  academics who thought they had it nailed; who thought they controlled the  knowledge, the culture, of the time. So furious was she that she fell back on  the time-honored female occupation of making fun of how those scholars looked:  ". . . Others, though not past middle age, seemed creased and crushed into  shapes so singular that one was reminded of those giant crabs and crayfish who  heave with difficulty across the sand of an aquarium."  </P> <P> Virginia Woolf went on to be a very famous novelist whose books are still in  print, while few of those on the faculties of Oxford and Cambridge from that  time (which remember, in those days, she was not allowed to attend), are  remembered by anyone at all.  </P> <P> More recently, a lowly British journalist named Brenda Maddox visited the  preeminent James Joyce scholar, Richard Ellmann, in his Oxford digs,  respectfully asking if he thought there might be material for a book on Nora  Barnacle, Joyce's wife. Ellmann said no, Nora wasn't important, and besides, he  was a Ph.D. and he'd already done a book. But Maddox went on, wrote her book  (which won a passel of prizes) and incidentally uncovered a raft of Joyce  letters that the great scholar had suppressed.  </P> <P> Whew! Lucky for everybody that Brenda Maddox was locked out, not the owner of a  Ph.D., to all intents and purposes invisible. Otherwise, somebody might have  gotten embarrassed. Just as, when Barbara Tuchman wrote "March of Folly,"  taking as her subject the "wooden-headed" errors committed by men in leadership  positions, all the way down through history from Troy to Vietnam, some men in  current power might have taken offense (or God forbid!) even changed their  ways, except that Tuchman was locked out, degreeless, still invisible, even  with both her Pulitzer Prizes, her secure niche on the best-seller list.  </P> <P> None of this, by the way, is about men and women. It is about systems of "Us"  and "Them." When I was a first-grader at St. Dominic's Elementary School, the  nuns taught us that the whole world was divided into Catholics and  non-Catholics. (That system, so convenient in the first grade, ceased to apply  when our age hit double digits.) Armenians, historically beset upon from all  sides, have evolved a system of Armenians ("Us") and "Odars" (everybody else).  In public America, the system has narrowed down and narrowed down; our world  has become a place of momentous conflict between Some Guys. For the working  classes, it's the Rams and Raiders crashing into each other on Sunday  afternoons, with multiple injuries, and winners and losers. (And "invisible"  ladies: cheerleading if they're young, making Super Bowl buffets if they've  already borne children.) For intellectuals, our world is pretty much described  and defined to us by White Guys, usually from the American East. Some of them  own toupees; some have earned Ph.D.s. They're very nice, by and large, until  somebody tries to open their doors, get inside their system. Then they get a  little peevish. (Who can blame them?)  </P> <P> But outside these systems, this grid of knowledge-as-football -- of leadership  as Super Bowl contest between "Us" and some "Evil Empire," all that sort of  thing -- "invisible" people keep doing their own work and redefining the  universe in ways that the system can't see. Maybe -- listen to this! -- maybe  Barbara Tuchman wasn't invisible; maybe her fellow historians locked inside  their university walls were blind as bats, dopey as crayfish heaving with  difficulty across the sands of the cosmic aquarium, totally impervious to and  unaware of the lovely, delicate Tuchman fish swimming in circles above all  those crabby scholars.  </P> <P> More and more "invisible" people keep coming into view these days. A whole  Latino exhibit, for instance, down at the County Museum. Frank Romero, a  Chicano Guy who's been drawing pictures of cars all his life, suddenly gets his  cars inside, pinned up on Establishment walls. Gilbert Lujan hauls an  honest-to-God real Chevy inside those hitherto almost always locked doors, and  suddenly this Chevy is visible, even though Romero and Lujan didn't exactly  make it by the academic route. . . .  </P> <P> Partly, all this is written in bad faith, by a genuine Ph.D. who believed in  the system and has an unreadable 535-page doctoral dissertation to prove it.  But when I was in graduate school at UCLA in the '60s, a lot of bright Bruins  and Trojans thought that they were going to change the world. Out there on the  margin, making canapes and giving parties to further their husbands' promotions  -- in between having a total of seven children -- two invisible faculty wives,  having, as Tuchman once described her own condition, "no status whatsoever,"  wrote their first and second and third novels. Today, Diane Johnson is a  MacArthur Prize winner; Alison Lurie has her Pulitzer.  </P> <P> I guess the message is this: Wake up, Boys! Unlock those doors! Let's have a  conversation or a dance instead of the same old intellectual football game.  There's a bigger world out there than you know, something beyond your  Establishment credentials.  </P> <P> It could be said that Barbara Tuchman missed out by never being quite accepted  by the history Establishment. But other voices from the invisible world are  whispering, shouting, calling out: It's the Establishment who missed out in not  quite having accepted Barbara Tuchman.  </P></p>

			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / World Stock Markets: Rolimpex offer returns to original price Yesterday saw the public offer of 50 per cent of the equity in Rolimpex, the state-owned agricultural goods import and export company, open at the original minimum price of 300,000 zlotys per share, in spite of earlier statements by the Privatisation Ministry that the price would be reduced to take in the market downturn, writes Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. Defending this, Mr Wieslaw Kaczmarek, the minister, said: 'It is not my intention to contribute to the fall in prices by dropping the Rolimpex price  -it is a first rate company.' Yesterday also saw the first market quotation of shares in the recently privatised Jelfa pharmaceuticals group, which fell 7 per cent from the initial public offer price of 300,000. Equities staged a rebound after the recent correction, but light volume and moderate price movements were seen as signals that the market had not recovered confidence after more than three months of bearish trade. The Wig index rose 226.5, or 2.9 per cent, to 8,019.0 in turnover that fell 7.5 per cent to 509bn zlotys.</p>

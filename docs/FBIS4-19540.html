			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse and </F> newly appointed head of the majority's list for the European  elections, by Anne Fulda and Joseph Mace-Scaron; place and date  not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [LE FIGARO] How did you react  to the remarks made by some members of the Republican Party  after your appointment?    [Baudis] Without great surprise. Whenever there is a new  and rather unexpected element in public life, that always  provokes some trouble and turmoil. That is inevitable.  Moreover, the media world is such that negative remarks are  taken up and reported more readily than positive remarks or  encouragements. There have nonetheless been more encouragements  than reservations! For some sections of the media, the result  was a surprise.    I understand there bitterness. When you support a candidate,  you always find it difficult to accept that he was not chosen,  especially because Jean-Francois Deniau is a man of great  qualities. If I had not been appointed, my friends would have  felt sadness or bitterness. It is human and logical. There is  no reason to be surprised about it or to overdramatize things.    [LE FIGARO] In addition to this surprise, some members of  the RPR [Rally for the Republic] are likely to be sparing in  their support.    [Baudis] No, I am convinced that the majority parties will  support and actively participate in the campaign. All the  leaders have told me that. Just as the prime minister assured  me of the government's support.    [LE FIGARO] What do you think of the "other majority list,"  that of Philippe de Villiers?    [Baudis] It is not another majority list, it is a dissident  list whose approach is violently anti-European, radically  different from the policy pursued by the government and  supported by the majority. There is a single majority list and  you will see in the next few days that this fact will be  confirmed by all the political officials.    Any other list is an attempt at division which hampers the  majority and seeks to weaken it. I would like to add that our  list is open to the different currents of thinking which coexist  within the majority, it is a union list.    What is interesting is that, in this election, we will see  other lists whose candidates will all have voted yes or all have  voted no in the Maastricht referendum. The only list which will  be open to people who voted yes and people who voted no will be  ours. This list will be the best reflection of France.  and Moscow, as well as Riyadh, Muscat, and Abu Dhabi.</p>

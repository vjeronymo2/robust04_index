			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Police from south  China's Guangdong Province seized 1,408 kg of marijuana and  arrested 15 alleged drug smugglers after a sea chase this week.    This drugs haul from a ship in the South China Sea was the  largest since the founding of New China in 1949.    Seven alleged drug smugglers, with Thailand and Hong Kong  passports, were arrested on board a ship of unidentified  nationality. Also arrested were eight people from the mainland  of China who were at the scene in boats, allegedly to receive  the smuggled drugs. The drugs seized were in 51 boxes.    Details of the haul and the arrests were given here today by  a spokesman of the Department of Public Security of the  Guangdong Provincial Government.    On April 21, police of Guangdong Provincial Frontier Defence  heard that an international drug smuggling ship was going to  hand over drugs to smugglers in boats from the mainland of China  the following day. They pursued the ship and boats for more  than one hour and captured all the drugs and the drug smugglers.    Investigations showed that the drugs came from a country in  Southeast Asia. Further investigations are going on.</p>

			<p><P> May 8, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HEARING TO FOCUS ON ROLE OF BUILDING INSPECTORS  </P> <P> Los Angeles building inspectors will be under scrutiny Monday when officials  take the unusual step of trying to determine whether partially built townhouses  can be completed.  </P> <P> City zoning administrators will conduct a 2 p.m. hearing at the Van Nuys  Woman's Club to decide whether the Department of Building and Safety's  inspectors properly interpreted zoning maps when they authorized construction  of the 24 townhouses in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> Homeowners contend that the final phase of the West Hills Condominium  development is too tall and sits too close to the site's property line. They  say the $7.5-million project fails to meet height and setback requirements  approved for the area by the City Council.  </P> <P> The dispute is not the first involving the townhouse project and building  inspectors. Last year, building and safety officials pronounced the project  finished before ground was even broken for its construction.  </P> <P> An inspector hurrying to finish paper work before his retirement is blamed for  that mix-up, which occurred when building and safety issued a report to  Councilman Marvin Braude that said the hilltop project was completed and fully  occupied.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Discovered Mistake  </P> <P> Robert Ayers, the department's San Fernando Valley manager, said his office  promptly discovered the mistake and issued a correcting letter to Braude about  three weeks later -- a fact confirmed by the councilman's office.  </P> <P> But a copy of the second letter was never forwarded to the Woodland Hills  resident who had asked Braude about the status of the development. As a result,  homeowners assert, they let their guard down and the final phase of the project  was begun before they had a chance to protest. Their complaints prompted Braude  to call for Monday's unusual hearing.  </P> <P> Officials acknowledge that homeowners are rarely hesitant to call attention to  problems at neighborhood construction sites in the Valley and surrounding  areas.  </P> <P> Complaints from Sherman Oaks residents last year over the size of a new luxury  home being built next to Beverly Glen Boulevard resulted in inspectors forcing  the developer to lower the dwelling's roof line.  </P> <P> Protests over the seven-story height of an office building at Fairway Avenue  and Ventura Boulevard in Studio City, which was approved to be three floors  high, prompted a lengthy city investigation last year of inspectors'  interpretation of height restrictions. Officials decided that the height had  been properly calculated. But the community furor prompted City Councilmen John  Ferraro and Michael Woo to take steps to eliminate a special height bonus that  benefited the builder.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Among Toughest Codes  </P> <P> Homeowner unhappiness over what became known as the "Cracked Slab Controversy"  caused Thousand Oaks to enact one of the toughest building codes in the state  when the Conejo Valley community incorporated 25 years ago.  </P> <P> The first housing tracts that were built in the then-unincorporated valley in  the late 1950s and early 1960s were constructed on concrete slabs approved by  Ventura County under standards that had worked well in other parts of the  county. But when the slabs proved too thin to withstand the expansion and  contraction of the adobe-like soil of the Conejo Valley, scores of dwellings  along Moorpark Road were damaged.  </P> <P> The city's founding fathers quickly decided to "require more involved soils  tests and additional steel and deeper footings," said David Hueners, a senior  civil engineer with Thousand Oaks' Building and Safety Department. "They also  required an inspector to be on the site when concrete was being poured. Our  foundation standards are still higher than in most local areas. Contractors are  often surprised when they come out here for the first time."  </P> <P> In nearby Agoura, building inspectors for Los Angeles County began looking more  closely at development projects in 1982 after residents of a condominium  project complained to the County Board of Supervisors that their 27-unit  development was collapsing.  </P> <P> Officials concluded that unauthorized earthmoving weakened the project's  foundations and caused some of the $100,000 units to begin sinking. The  developer eventually bought back the Colodny Drive units and repaired them.  </P> <P> But county officials called the construction a disgrace and, after an  investigation, ordered a three-day suspension for the building and safety  inspector who had been assigned to monitor the condominiums' construction.  Since then, inspectors have been told to carefully watch for signs of  unauthorized or unanticipated alterations around new construction, said Doug  Browne, who heads Los Angeles County's building and safety office in Calabasas.  </P> <P> Such attention paid off last year when a sharp-eyed inspector noticed that the  ground next to freshly poured cement slabs at a Calabasas Park luxury home  tract was disturbed. Further investigation showed that a contractor had  accidentally altered the level of sand spread beneath about half a dozen of the  homes' slabs, Browne said.  </P> <P> County officials required the builder to halt further work until concrete  coring tests could determine the extent of the problem. The county ordered the  builder to reinforce some of the slabs and change the framing on some of the  dwellings before construction could resume. The early detection saved the  builder and his eventual buyers "tens of thousands of dollars," Browne said.  BOB POOL  </P></p>

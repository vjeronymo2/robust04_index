			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Bychkov] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 11 TASS--"The Russian side is satisfied  with practically everything in the deal to sell Malaysia 18  MiG-29 fighters and Moscow considers it beneficial," a Russian  Foreign Ministry top official said.    In an interview with ITAR-TASS on Wednesday, Anatoliy  Khmelnitskiy, head of the second Asia department of the Russian  Foreign Ministry, said that "presently, the Russian-Malaysian  deal estimated at about 600 million U.S. dollars is at the final  stage of consideration. There are no serious obstacles for its  signing."    A Russian delegation led by Deputy Foreign Minister  Aleksandr  Panov has just returned from Malaysia where it held a series of  fruitful meetings and talks. They aimed at specifying the  details of a large package of agreements now in the works,  Khmelnitskiy said.    Apart from selling MiG fighters to Malaysia, the sides also  discussed the possibility of launching the production of spare  parts for them in Malaysia. Bilateral agreements between the  two countries have committed them to establish a sound  maintenance base and teach Malaysian pilots to fly Russian MiG  fighters.    Malaysia will pay part of the deal with palm oil. "This fact  must not worry Russian people. Malaysian palm oil is not only a  highly nutritious product, but is also indispensable in various  industries, including aerospace industry," Khmelnitskiy said.    If the deal goes through, Malaysia will be the first  Southeast Asian country to be granted access to Russian weapons  and military technologies.</p>

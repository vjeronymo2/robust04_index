			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Import prices 'often higher' than US steel  -ITC staff report will bear on dumping decisions THE PRICE of steel imported into the US is often higher than the steel sold by the American mills which are accusing their foreign competitors of widespread dumping, according to a report produced by the staff of the International Trade Commission. The ITC's staff report forms part of the record for the agency's six commissioners when they weigh their decisions on 72 flat-rolled dumping and subsidy steel cases now moving towards conclusion. Injury findings in the controversial cases are due on July 27. 'Imports generally cost twice as much as domestic steel,' said a senior ITC staff member, who asked not to be identified. Often the foreign products are of higher quality, or capable of special use, and price is not a factor. In fact, high-quality imports often cost so much more that a lawyer defending South Korea before the ITC introduced commissioners to a 'dummy theory' - arguing that US steel customers had to be 'dummies' if they are buying from abroad a product they can get domestically and paying more. The prices charged for steel imports could be the key to the 72 cases against foreign companies, which are accused of depressing US prices. About Dollars 3.2bn (Pounds 2.2bn) in preliminary tariffs have been levied against them, but the duties would be lifted if the ITC fails to find that imports are the cause of the US industry's troubles. A survey conducted by the non-partisan ITC staff found that price is rarely an issue when US manufacturers purchase foreign steel products. More often, the steel is purchased for reasons of quality, reliable supply or superior technical support - the reasons they buy from Americans. According to the survey, users also buy from domestic sources because of shorter lead times between orders and delivery, because of 'Buy American' policies, and of scope for placing smaller minimum orders. Several purchasers said they would not buy any foreign steel if comparable domestic products were available at lower prices; others said they bought imports because a comparable product was not available from domestic mills. The staff also found that foreign companies as a whole had increased market penetration for hot-rolled steel. The share steadily increased from 13.2 per cent in 1990 to 15.3 per cent in 1992. However, the increases were captured by Canada, South Korea and the Netherlands, while other countries' shares were constant or declined. Lawyers representing foreign producers were pleased with the staff report, but say the ITC commissioners are unpredictable and sometimes biased towards the domestic industry. The senior ITC staffer confirmed that impression. 'A minority of commissioners vote on the merits of the individual cases,' he said. 'We look at the decisions. . . and they're from Mars.' Mr Jim Bovard, an expert on the 'unfair trade' laws, said the commission could look at the higher prices and rule the defendants guilty of 'quality dumping' - meaning that the price difference is less than the quality difference, and the foreign steelmaker should charge more even if prices are higher. 'The decisions are often written by the commissioners' staffers,' he said. 'They are political animals.' Meanwhile, US steel users have organised to lobby against the industry's effort. They say the higher prices resulting from the tariffs will make their products uncompetitive on export markets. The Coalition of American Businesses for Stable Steel Supplies said the high tariffs hurts small business which is expected to generate most of the country's new job. 'Supply instability and higher prices will reduce the competitiveness of literally thousands of American companies that employ perhaps up to 8m American workers,' the group said.</p>

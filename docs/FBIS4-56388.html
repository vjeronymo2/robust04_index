			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Undated letter to the editor by apparently former priest </F> Oscar Macias]    [Text]  <H5>  Don Samuel's Priests </H5>   The Editor:    I am writing to you to clarify something in Rodrigo Vera's  article on page seven of Issue 904 of PROCESO (28 February).    This is in connection with the campaign that EL UNIVERSAL,  SIEMPRE!, and IMPACTO are conducting to lay the blame for the  armed uprising in the Chiapas Highlands on Samuel Ruiz, the  bishop of San Cristobal.    The article says that Father Otilio Lopez Lopez said that  several priests from the diocese of San Cristobal left because  they disagreed with Bishop Ruiz's pastoral line.    Among the priests it mentions are Oscar Macias, Jose Reyes  Rangel, Aurelio Zapata, and Pedro Ramuco.    I disagree completely with Otilio; his assertion is false  and  deceitful. I am Father Oscar Macias. I worked in the northern  area of the Chiapas Highlands from 1962 to 1983. I did my work  in Yajalon, Tila, Tumbala, Salto de Agua, and a bit in  Sabanilla: five municipalities, one of them Tzeltal and four  Chol. I spent 15 of those years, up to 1983, in the Tila parish  working with my Chol brothers. I performed my work in full  support of the pastoral line that we and Don Samuel were  pursuing in the diocese. The reason for my leaving the diocese  and the parish was totally and exclusively personal. I had  fathered a child and gotten married; I currently live in the  state of Morelos.    As for the colleagues of mine whose names are mentioned, I  would dare say that Don Samuel's pastoral line was not the  reason for their departure.    Jose Reyes Rangel (may God keep him in his Kingdom) saw his  addiction to alcohol worsen and had to leave. Aurelio Zapata,  who like me is from Chapa de Corzo, devoted himself generously  to the peasants of Zocoltenango and suffered reprisals from the  cattlemen: he was kidnapped and tortured for several days. He  has recovered slowly and incompletely; he is unable to work.  Pedro Ramuco was of great help to Don Samuel as vicar general of  the diocese. He left because of a severe nervous breakdown  caused by death threats owing to his pastoral work with the  peasants.    As for the three other priests that Otilio mentions, Jose  Conrado Ruiz was already elderly and fell ill; Juan Inocencio  Galvan was or is a traditionalist, a follower of Monsignor Le  Febre; and Antonio Patino was there before Don Samuel.    Elias Martinez, Bulmaro Gordillo, and Cecilio Baraibar left  for personal reasons. Cecilio got married. Their work was in the  seminary.    Otilio Lopez himself was not the vicar of Ocosingo; he  worked  in the Comitan area. He did not grow in his priesthood and left  it. I know from a recent report that he belongs to PRI  [Institutional Revolutionary Party] and works in the Chiapas  CNC. Congratulations.    It is very easy to say that Don Samuel, as a punishment, is  denying the sacraments to those who do not think like him.  Couldn't the same thing be said here in Morelos? Because those  who want baptism, confirmation, matrimony, first communion, and  the coming-out celebration at age 15 have to attend a series of  talks on the sacraments by the catechizers. Otherwise, they are  not accepted. We should keep in mind that the bishop of this  diocese is Monsignor Luis Reynoso, who is not like Don Samuel  and presumably opposes his pastoral activity.    I must emphasize that Don Samuel's pastoral activity can be  none other than the gospel of Jesus, who was born and lived  among, supported, helped, and opted for the poor right up to  Calvary.    I congratulate Don Samuel, of whom I think highly and with  whom I was very pleased to work, and my colleagues in the  diocese, many of whom I no longer know, for their resolute  devotion to our Indian brothers. I would have liked to be with  them during the events in early 1994.    Yours truly, Oscar Macias</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Speaking to a THAN SETTHAKIT correspondent about the  recent Thai-U.S. negotiations on an aviation agreement, Warawut  Bunyatket, director of the International Affairs and the  Aviation Industry Division of Thai Airways International [THAI],  said that THAI, for the time being, is not interested in  increasing the number of its regular flights or opening new  flights to the United States because it is rather difficult to  make any profit from flying to that country due to strong  competition and price cutting campaigns among the U.S. airlines.  It is unlikely that THAI will make any change in its operation  even if the new agreement allows it to fly up to 38 flights per  week to the United States.    He said: "In any event, what we want is equality in carrying  passengers from third countries. The Thai side proposed a  limitation on the number of passengers from third countries for  each flight at 45 percent. We do not know if the U.S. side will  accept it or not."    Worawut went on to say that THAI is now engaging in a "code  sharing" [preceding two words in English] operation through  aircraft and ticket sharing with United Airlines as a means of  maintaining its market share in the region pending the  conclusion of an agreement with the United States that will  incorporate destinations in the United States to which THAI can  fly.    Meanwhile, Mahidon Chantharangsuk, permanent secretary of  the  Communications Ministry and head of the Thai delegation at the  next round of the aviation talks with the United States to be  held in Bangkok in June, said the negotiations will cover the  details of issues concerned, especially the sharing percentage  [as published], the flight numbers, and new destinations in the  United States requested by THAI.    During the first round of the negotiations, the Thai side  made four major proposals. First, the U.S. airlines operate 38  flights per week to Thailand -- 31 for passengers and 7 for  cargo. Presently, three U.S. airlines operate 28 flights per  week to Thailand while Thai has only four flights per week to  the United States. Second, the U.S. airlines are required to  carry at least 55 percent passengers from Thailand on each  flight before it is allowed to carry passengers from third  countries.    Third, the U.S. airlines are required to carry up to 70  percent tourists on each flight on which they intend to seek  permission to fly to a new destination in Thailand. Fourth, the  total number of flights between the two countries is equally  divided for airlines of the two countries.    On the other hand, the U.S. side made two proposals. First,  the Thai side should stop freezing the number of seats of each  U.S. flight at only 290. Second, the procedure for the  collection of the value-added tax should be revised.    The permanent secretary of the communications minister said  that the conclusion of an aviation agreement will further expand  the aviation services between the two countries. He will  encourage THAI to increase its regular flights to the United  States. THAI is capable of making up to 11 flights per week to  the United States.</p>

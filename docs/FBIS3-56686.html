			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Vladislav Kozyakov] </F>   [Excerpts] At the Russian-American summit in Moscow last  week, almost the most important issue was the question of  economic cooperation, aimed at supporting the economic reform in  Russia. Vladislav Kozyakov comments. [passage omitted]    One of the most significant results of the latest summit, in  terms of economic cooperation, was undoubtedly the agreement on  the sale of Russian uranium to America. In the next 20 years,  Russia will process some 500 tonnes of weapons uranium. The  processed uranium will be shipped to America as fuel for nuclear  power stations there, at a cost of 12 billion dollars. This  deal is mutually advantageous -- Russia will receive the  much-needed hard currency, while America perhaps will produce  cheaper electric energy by its nuclear power stations -- but  what seems to be the most significant in this agreement is the  overcoming of one of the barriers in the way of Russian goods to  America.    The point is that Russia has many more such goods that could  compete on an equal footing with others on the American market  and on other Western markets, but such trade in those goods is  being hampered by different kinds of barriers, or high tariffs,  or prohibition law enacted in the past, or antidumping  procedures. [passage omitted]    Russia has goods to sell. This is not only space technology  or energy supplies, and not only aluminum or uranium. There are  other technologies -- ferro-alloy and mineral fertilizers, some  types of electronics and products of machine-building  industries. These are competitive goods, but to break into the  markets has been very difficult. This may sound paradoxical,  but it is precisely because of their high competitiveness.  About 20 types of Russian goods fall within the antidumping  procedure by American and Western countries, the aim of which,  of course, is to take them out of the markets.    Undoubtedly, to agree on the issue of trade can sometimes be  very difficult, but the Russian-American contract on uranium and  other accords at the Moscow summit give one the hope that the  American market will at long last be open to Russian goods.  This would be one more practical confirmation of the successful  development of partnership between Russia and the United States  of America.</p>

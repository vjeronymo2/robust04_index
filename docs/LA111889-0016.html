			<p><P> November 18, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY OPENS THE BERLIN WALL  </P> <P> Over the last few months I have been watching, reading, and thinking about the  seemingly momentous events occurring in this world of ours. I am a strong  national security advocate (went to West Point and work in the defense  industry), and yet I find myself wondering if I should change careers. The  Berlin Wall is coming down and I am greatly moved. To all those who would  continue to subvert the will of the people I say, let freedom ring and  democracy reign so that "government of the people, by the people and for the  people shall" spread throughout this earth.  </P> <P> Let us rejoice and act that our peoples may move forward, together, as there is  much to do. There are scourges that must be addressed; toxic wastes, poverty,  homelessness, alcoholism, disease, natural disasters, a failing infrastructure  of roads, bridges, dams, and an environment that bleeds and cries for help. As  I look in wonderment at these incredible times, sensing vast changes, I am  grateful to God, and ask how can I help? The Statue of Liberty must have wiped  some tears away as her arms spread its welcome to our Eastern Bloc friends. I  know I did.  </P> <P> CRAIG V. LANDRITH, Hermosa Beach  </P></p>

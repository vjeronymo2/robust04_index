			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Observer: Flight scheduling How times change. There was a time when Britain's company chairmen and politicians timed their fact-finding missions to South Africa to escape Britain's bitter winters. However, Board of Trade president Michael Heseltine has chosen to forego the delights of Britain's summer season and spend the week after next in South Africa. Westminster-watchers believe that this could mean one of two things. Either the long-rumoured cabinet reshuffle won't take place during that week or the Prezza has persuaded his boss not to make him take over Sir Norman Fowler's glorified pr job as Conservative party chairman. They could be right on both scores. After John Major's strong showing yesterday, Observer's bet is that the reshuffle will be delayed until just before the House of Commons breaks up for its summer hols.</p>

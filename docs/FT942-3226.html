			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (12): Lower-cost options - Advances in packet switched data services For many types of enterprise, buying-in a packet switched data service is an attractive proposition. With each user's traffic sharing a service provider's network facilities, the packet option can be a low cost method of communicating data. Contracting-out the provision and management of the service also frees user resources and allows the organisation's staff to concentrate on the core activity. Networks based on the internationally-standardised X25 packet switching protocol have been particularly successful in the industrialised economies over the last two decades. Apart from the transfer of general in-house data between simple terminals at different corporate locations, X25 is widely used for applications such as electronic mail, electronic data interchange, database access and information retrieval, and a broad spectrum of message transactions including automatic teller machine operations and credit card authorisation. The French Minitel Videotex service, which logged 1.1bn calls in 1993, also runs on an X25 network. This all adds up to large sums of money for the telephone companies which operate public packet switched networks and the independent providers of managed data network services. According to Vans Markets Europe, the continuously updated report from the UK's Ovum telecommunications consultancy, the two categories of packet operator generated business worth Ecu2.65bn in Europe alone in 1992. While Sprint claims to be the world's largest packet network operator, Ovum says that the three European market leaders are networks operated by national telephone companies - France Telecom's Transpac, Telefonica's Iberpac, and Deutsche Telekom's Datex-P. Ovum estimates that BT's GNS has been eased out of fourth place by the Unisource combine of PTT Telecom Netherlands, Tolia of Sweden and the Swiss PTT. Among the biggest non-telephone company packet operators in the region are the airline service organisation, Societe Internationale de Telecommunications Aeronautiques, IBM, GEIS, Sprint and AT&amp;T/lstel. Ovum forecasts a European X25 value added network (van) market worth Ecu4.8bn by 1997. Alan Taffel, vice president of marketing at Alcatel Data Networks, a big X25 system vendor part-owned by Sprint, attributes the success of the technology to three main factors. Firstly, its designers specified comprehensive error checking and management capabilities, allowing it to run over virtually any type of network, including those with poor quality links - 'we used to joke you could run an X25 network over barbed wire,' says Taffel. Secondly. X25 has built-in protocol conversion allowing it to connect dissimilar types of terminals. Thirdly, it has an access control mechanism for security purposes. The price paid for the ability to run over poor quality lines is that X25 typically operates at modest speed. Although, as Taffel points out, X25 equipment can operate at up to 2mbits/second much of the installed base has a speed ceiling of 64kbits/s. Given that the quality of transmission links in many networks has improved dramatically since X25 was first designed, some experts now regard its error correction capabilities as an unnecessary overhead, and consider the technology unsuitable for high volume, high speed applications such as local area network interconnection. 'The technology really is too slow for many applications,' argues Simon Goodwin, network marketing manager at AT&amp;T in the UK. 'It's rock solid but very inefficient.' Part of the gap between packet performance and corporate requirements is filled by frame relay. This is essentially a stripped-down version of X25 which, without heavy error checking overheads, can run at speeds up to 45mbits/s. Even on a 64kbits/s link, data throughput with frame relay can be 10 times higher than with X25. At present there are around 10 frame relay network operators in the US, many offering international connectivity, 17 in Europe, eight in Asia, five in Canada, three in the Middle East and one in South America. In practice, frame relay is the first of a clutch of very high speed packet-based services and technologies. One fast packet service originated in the US is the Switched Multi-megabit Data Service (SMDS). This appears in such networks as the Super Joint Academic Network (Superjanet) built by BT to link about 50 universities research establishments and hospitals around the UK and to carry a mixture of voice, data, image and video traffic. Both frame relay and SMDS can be run over asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) networks. Synoptics, a leading ATM vendor, says the technology is optimised for emerging, computer-intensive multimedia applications. The commercialisation of ATM could herald a big shift in the structure of the telecoms industry overall. ATM: Vendor and Operator Strategies, a recent report from UK telecoms consultancy, Analysys, suggests that power will shift to corporate users who are already installing ATM and concentrating functionality and added value inside the boundary between private and public networks. 'The player with the most to lose from ATM is the telecoms operator,' comments Peter Aknai, one of the report's authors. 'ATM threatens to reduce the operator's dominant role in the telecoms value chain to that of a commodity bit carrier.' The fast packet, multimedia age will be equally challenging for the independent van operators - 'if they can't transport that volume of data, if they can't connect the applications, then they are going to be marginalised,' says Don Eungblut, managing consultant and a specialist in network services with PA Consultants.

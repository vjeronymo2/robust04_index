			<p>920115 FT  15 JAN 92 / Groupe Bull near to decision on US partner GROUPE BULL, the ailing French computer manufacturer, is close to a decision on which US computer company it will choose as technology and equity partner, according to sources close to the negotiations. The sources say the French government is deeply divided over the outcome. A decision is expected next week. Mrs Edith Cresson, the French prime minister, and Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the industry minister, favour Hewlett-Packard, the US minicomputer and instrumentation supplier. The French Ministry of Finance, however, is believed to support International Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer. IBM is reported to be extremely anxious to deny other US manufacturers the opportunity of a partnership with Bull. Hewlett-Packard is claiming that it can offer Bull better technological collaboration in three key areas - high performance computer chips, client-server computing and advanced networking. Bull is an attractive partner since it has access to the French government market, it has technology of value to its competitors and it would represent an opportunity to share costs of developing the next generation of high-powered workstat-ions. Rumours that an investment in the French-Italian chip maker SGS Thomson would be part of the price of the deal have no foundation but the French have asked both IBM and H-P if they would be willing to license its high performance chip technology to SGS Thomson.</p>

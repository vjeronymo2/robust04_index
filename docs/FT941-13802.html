			<p>940124 FT  24 JAN 94 / Rolls and fishes feed the 5,000 At least one of the chefs working for Town &amp; County Catering used to be in the army Catering Corps. Cooking for the troops amid exploding shells on the Falkland Islands was, he admitted, 'good training' for what he was undertaking last night. For at Earls Court in London, 5,410 guests assembled for the UK's biggest sit-down dinner since 1925. Then, it was a gathering of 8,000 freemasons at nearby Olympia in the presence of Albert, Duke of York - later King George VI - at the Masonic Million Memorial Fund dinner, held to raise Pounds 1m to build the Freemasons Hall as their headquarters and a memorial to masons killed in the first world war. Yesterday was a more 1990s occasion: a corporate junket for worldwide distributors and agents of agricultural machine producer New Holland, a joint venture between carmakers Ford and Fiat. The catering budget alone was 'well into six figures', with the total cost undisclosed. If that might have left Prince Albert bemused, then last night's entertainment certainly would - US singer Ray Charles, performance artists on stilts and bungee jumpers suspended from the ceiling illuminated by a laser show. He might have been more at home with the menu. Diners last night enjoyed salmon, chicken consomme, beef forestiere with vegetables and new potatoes, British and Italian cheeses, and pears in filo pastry. The freemasons in 1925 sat down to a dinner of salmon with cucumber, lamb Victoria, chicken garnished with tongue, York ham, tutti-frutti ice cream and gateau. Last night's dinner took on the air of a military operation. As Mr Stephen McManus, divisional director of Town &amp; County, explained: 'It's all down to logistics and communication. For an event like this to be a success, it comes down to the planning.' It took a year of planning to assemble 450 tables, laid with 10,000 items of linen, 135,000 pieces of cutlery, china and glassware, surrounded by 5,410 chairs, and served from eight mobile kitchens. It also took a touch of military discipline to prepare 50,000 canapes, 370 gallons of consomme, 1 tonne of salmon, 1.4 tonnes of beef, 5,500 stuffed pears, 9,000 petits fours and 10,000 bread rolls. Mr Malcolm Emery, who headed the team of 128 chefs and 800 serving staff, is used to feeding 38,000 people a day as head of catering at Wimbledon, but even he had served only 2,500 at one sitting before. 'This is the biggest thing I've done in 20 years,' he said.</p>

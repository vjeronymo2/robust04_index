			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] A senior Chinese official has given an assurance  that civil servants who hold British citizenship under the  British Nationality Scheme will not be discriminated against in  their careers with the Special Administrative Region (SAR)  government. Speaking at a meeting with the New Hong Kong  Alliance yesterday, visiting Deputy Director of the Hong Kong  and Macao Affairs Office (HKMAO), Wang Fengchao, said the civil  servants should not be afraid of revealing their British  citizenship.    The chairman of the Hong Kong Civil Servants' Association,  Peter Wong Hyo, last night welcomed the clarification. He said  it was a good thing for the Chinese Government to clear the  doubts of civil servants.    "The Chinese Government will not discriminate against civil  servants who have obtained British citizenship through the  British Nationality Scheme," Mr Wang was quoted by Pao  Ping-wing, of the Alliance, as saying.    Yesterday's assurance cleared up fears about China's  attitude  towards the nationality scheme, which was introduced to tackle  the confidence crisis following the Tiananmen Square crackdown  in 1989. It grants full British citizenship to 25,000 families  in phases. China's refusal to recognise the scheme has created  uncertainty over whether civil servants who obtained the right  of abode in Britain would be victimised.    Mr Wang said: "Holders of the citizenship have no reason to  worry about the exposure of their status." The nationality  factor would only carry weight in the promotion of civil  servants to secretary and deputy secretary levels, he added.  Article 101 of the Basic Law stipulates that government posts  at the rank of policy secretaries and deputy secretaries should  be held by Chinese citizens with no right of abode in other  countries.</p>

			<p>940512 FT  12 MAY 94 / International Company News: America Online in multimedia deal America Online, a fast-growing US provider of telecommunications-based information services, announced yesterday that it was buying Redgate Communications, a privately-owned multimedia services company, for around Dollars 28m in stock. Mr Steve Case, president of America Online, said modem-based on-line services and CD-Rom based multimedia were both growing rapidly, but so far they had been separate. As a result, on-line services were unexciting and CD-Rom titles were not connected to a telecommunications network. 'The combination of America Online and Redgate enables us to create hybrid offerings that marry the best attributes of each,' he added. Redgate is based in Vero Beach, Florida, employs around 100 and had 1993 revenues of around Dollars 13m. Its shareholders will receive 444,184 shares of America Online stock, which closed last night at Dollars 64, down Dollars 1/2 .</p>

			<p><P> August 27, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> THE FAMILY THAT SURFS TOGETHER . . . ;  </P> <P> THE 11 MEMBERS OF THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY HAVE BEEN CARRIED THROUGH THEIR LIVES ON  A WAVE  </P> <P> A family's love for the ocean began in 1933 on a small island 10 miles off the  coast of Galveston, Tex.  </P> <P> Young Dorian Paskowitz was sick with pneumonia. He also had asthma and was  suffering from chills and a high fever. His mother, Rose, was ready to take him  to the hospital.  </P> <P> Then something happened that Dorian Paskowitz, now 67, remembers as clearly as  if it were yesterday. He was handed a newspaper picture of three surfers riding  a California wave. Surfing was his biggest love. Somehow, the picture poured  energy into him. He jumped up and said to his mother: "If you take me to  California, I'll get well tomorrow."  </P> <P> The next day, he got better.  </P> <P> A week later, Dorian, his brother, sister, uncle and mother moved to San Diego.  His father, Louis, stayed behind for nearly a year, working to make enough  money to recover from the Depression, which had caused him to lose his "Ready  to Wear" store and consequently stripped him of financial stability.  </P> <P> The family was poor. But Dorian was never sick again.  </P> <P> Perhaps this is what prompts a man to devote his life to surfing, and to raise  a family of nine surfers, educating them himself, teaching the powers, wonders,  dangers and therapeutic qualities of the sea.  </P> <P> The 11-member Paskowitz family, most of whom reside in San Clemente, had a  reunion this weekend at the Oceanside Longboard Surfing club contest at the  Oceanside Pier.  </P> <P> They weren't hard to spot, with their colorful surfboards scattered all around  and their warm, supportive cheers for each other as they took to the surf.  </P> <P> There was Dorian, wearing a hat to protect his sunburned lips, his wife,  Juliette, proud mother of nine, and the kids, who aren't really kids at all  anymore. Starting from the top there's David (30), Jonathan (28), Abraham (27),  Israel (26), Moses (24), Adam (23), Salvador (22), Navah (20) and Joshua (14).  </P> <P> Juliette was the only one not entered in this weekend's tournament; Adam had to  leave early because of a business emergency.  </P> <P> They hadn't been together at the same time in two years, but the beach is such  an appropriate place for the Paskowitzes to reunite. Surfing has truly been a  guiding light for this family.  </P> <P> Perhaps Moses sums up the outlook best. "I call (surfing) a soul cleanser. It  makes you forget all your worries."  </P> <P> Louis Paskowitz never surfed and only saw Dorian surf once, but somehow he was  aware of how important it was to his son. Sometimes on school days, Louis would  give Dorian a quarter and say: "Go buy yourself a hamburger and go surfing."  </P> <P> Dorian surfed through his days at Point Loma High School, his two years at San  Diego State and then for a year at University of Hawaii, where he further  developed his skills and grew to appreciate the Hawaiian life style. Never  before had he seen such hospitality and friendliness. And never had he seen  such skillful surfers.  </P> <P> "It's just like you'd been singing in grammar school," Dorian says, "and  suddenly someone took you to the Metropolitan Opera House."  </P> <P> After a year in Hawaii, Paskowitz moved back to California and attended medical  school for five years at Stanford. Years later, while examining war veterans,  Paskowitz was able to tell if they were former surfers by the nobs on their  knees and the sand in their ears.  </P> <P> Paskowitz would say to a veteran: "You just been to Hawaii?"  </P> <P> He would say: "Yeah, how did you know?"  </P> <P> One time, though, he asked somebody if he had just been to California and was  told, "No, I'm from Hawaii, never been to California."  </P> <P> But the sand in his ear was unmistakably from California.  </P> <P> "Evidently," Paskowitz says, "he'd been to a beach where they import some  California sand."  </P> <P> Paskowitz lived for a year and a half in Israel, beginning in 1956. He says he  was the first person to bring a surfboard into the country and brought with him  the idealistic hope that if he introduced surfing to the Middle East, it might  help bring peace.  </P> <P> "At that time, I was very naive," he said. "I thought if the Arabs surfed  together, they could live together."  </P> <P> It was in Catalina, about a year later, that Dorian met Juliette, an opera  singer of Mexican descent who grew up in Long Beach. When he asked her to marry  him, he told her his plans didn't exactly conform with a typical American life  style. Dorian wanted to travel and raise a family of children who experienced  the world first hand, not from reading notes off a chalkboard.  </P> <P> "All I wanted them to do was surf," he said. "I knew if they were good surfers,  they'd be good human beings."  </P> <P> Juliette's reaction?  </P> <P> "All I could see," she says, "were those blue eyes."  </P> <P> Just once, Abraham Paskowitz would have liked a pair of clean socks or his own  tennis shoes. Just once, he would have liked his own bed.  </P> <P> The Paskowitzes learned to adapt to all kinds of living conditions.  </P> <P> "The one thing you could say about a Paskowitz is they could sleep anywhere,"  Moses says.  </P> <P> Abraham, whose wife Ladeshia is expecting a baby in October, will offer his  children a more permanent place to sleep. There will always be a home for his  family to return to, though he plans to mix in some Paskowitz tradition.  Surfing will be taught, and curiosity will be encouraged. Someday he plans to  tell his kids: "The world is your playground, but this is your home."  </P> <P> The Paskowitzes' home was usually a camper, and each morning the children would  wake up not knowing where they were. They learned to make do, Dorian often  seeking out spots where doctors were needed. Living quarters were sometimes  cramped, but as Moses puts it, you always had a best friend.  </P> <P> Because the children were so close, they were used to being around each other.  Dorian once rented a 16-bedroom mansion in Rhode Island, and after each kid had  run around and played in every inch of the house, they all returned to one room  to sleep.  </P> <P> "We were so used to sleeping together, we didn't want to be apart," Abraham  said.  </P> <P> And so they traveled and learned. Dorian and Juliette were the teachers; the  children went to regular schools on and off, but only David has a high school  diploma (although others have earned its equivalent). Creativity was  emphasized, and to this day it spills over into each of the Paskowitz's lives.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Artists  </P> <P> Salvador and Joshua would wile away hours and hours drawing. Joshua, Salvador  admits, has a good deal more raw talent. Joshua already has done logos and  designs for surfboards and plans to start doing more pencil art, with an  emphasis on surrealistic sketches.  </P> <P> Salvador recently published 25,000 copies of his own comic book, called "Wave  Warriors," and is flying to New Jersey next week to meet with publishers  interested in a second issue.  </P> <P> Salvador says he knows six computer languages to boot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Musicians  </P> <P> Surfer by day, David becomes Johnny Monster at night. He's the lead singer of a  rock band called Johnny Monster and the Nightmares, which has an "aggressive,  powerful guitar-oriented sound."  </P> <P> David's music career got its start seven years ago when he jumped the family  ship -- actually, the Paskowitzes' 1972 brown two-door Chevy Impala -- and  began singing with night club bands in New York City. Two years ago, he decided  the New York life style was too fast for him and returned to San Clemente and  his surfing roots. Now he can do both in an environment in which he is  comfortable.  </P> <P> Adam is about to sign a record contract with his band, Mozart. According to  David, he writes music for the intelligent man.  </P> <P> "Adam is a real genius," David says. "He's a nice guy trapped in a smart Jewish  man's body."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Girl  </P> <P> You can guess that this hasn't been the easiest gig for Navah, who has no  sisters and eight brothers. For the longest time, it seemed to her as if she  wasn't much more than her mom's kitchen helper.  </P> <P> "I was just the most protected person there could be," she said. "It's harder  for me to find boyfriends because my brothers are really critical."  </P> <P> Navah said she didn't really have her own identity until she was 15, when she  moved to New York to live with David. She tried to get into design school but  was told she needed some formal education. She came back after three years with  fluorescent red hair and a leather jacket.  </P> <P> This fall, she plans to do some modeling in Australia. She is currently singing  backup in Adam's band and still hopes to pursue a career in fashion design.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Black Sheep  </P> <P> If there is a rebel in the family, it is Jonathan. He spent eight years in  Israel, which can change a person's outlook on life.  </P> <P> "I saw the gunfire every night," he said.  </P> <P> When he returned, he tested the night life. As owner of a night club in Los  Gatos, he said he stayed up too late, drank too much and smoked too much.  </P> <P> "I was a bad egg," he says.  </P> <P> Surfing turned his life around again. He entered a longboarding contest five  years ago in Malibu and finished fourth. The feeling he got from being back on  the ocean made him feel as if he would never want to return to his former life  style. He now works as a public relations agent for a company that manufactures  surf products, and he sometimes gets autograph requests from little kids at  surf contests.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Football Player  </P> <P> Moses weighs 295 pounds and said he weighed more than 300 when he played  football for University Nevada-Las Vegas and New Mexico.  </P> <P> "I like a little bigger wave," he says with a smile.  </P> <P> He played two years at each school, starting all four. His inspiration in  football came from his Pop Warner days, when his mom told him she'd buy him a  chuck steak for every quarterback sack.  </P> <P> Moses would eventually like to oversee the production of a Paskowitz surfing  product. He's teaching surfing in the meantime, telling his students: "If Elvis  surfed, I really feel he'd be alive today."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Manager  </P> <P> Abraham is the director of the Paskowitz Surfing Summer Camp, which has gained  a world-wide reputation.  </P> <P> Just a few days ago, they wrapped up another successful 10-week session in San  Clemente, where it has been based for 15 years. It attracted 135 surfers from  places such as France, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, Japan and Mexico.  </P> <P> Abraham is a blend of creativity and business. "I create," he says, "for  monetary value."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Surfer  </P> <P> After Israel won the longboard world championships in Australia two years ago,  he found it easier to cash checks.  </P> <P> "I didn't need an ID," he says. "Everybody knew me. I must have signed  thousands of autographs."  </P> <P> It was about then that the prize money and sponsorships started flooding in.  Israel isn't sure he has always spent his money wisely.  </P> <P> "You get a lot of money but you have to budget it," he said. "I have not  inherited that wonderful Jewishness of saving money."  </P></p>

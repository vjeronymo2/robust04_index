Prof. Genevieve Clancy of Paris University No.1 of France  said that the West Sea barrage is a wonderful structure showing  the inexhaustible creative power of humanity. He said he had  visited many countries but had never seen such a great creation  beyond human imagination.    He noted that the barrage built by the Korean people with  their own designs, technique and materials fully showed the  mighty economic power of Korea and the indomitable fighting  spirit of the Korean people who are advancing under the banner  of self-reliance.    Head of the Cairo University delegation of Egypt 'Ali  Muhammad Sharawy said:    "Such a gigantic barrage as the West Sea barrage cannot be  seen anywhere else in the world. The U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean puppets squandered a large amount of materials and  funds in building the concrete wall, a symbol of division, in  the area South of the Military Demarcation Line, but the people  here have built a gigantic barrage for the prosperity of the  country in an eight kilometer section of a rough sea. Through  these two different realities we can see how just the cause of  the Korean people is."    Head of a Nepalese delegation for the study of the chuche  idea Manik Lal Shrestha said:    "The West Sea barrage is a vivid token of the enormous  economic power of Korea. With the independent national economy  and the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, the Korean people  are energetically stepping up production and construction,  unshaken by any economic pressure and blockade of the  imperialists."    Member of the Ayn Shams University delegation from Egypt  Salman Sali said it was a fascinating miracle that such great  project as the West Sea barrage was completed in a matter of  five years.</p>

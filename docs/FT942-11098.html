			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / Insurers face Dollars 16m claims on Senna's death Underwriters at the troubled Lloyd's of London and other insurers face claims of at least Dollars 16m (Pounds 11m) following the death last weekend of Ayrton Senna, the racing driver. Increasing fears about the safety of some professional sports are also expected to force up premiums for specialised personal accident cover. Senna, a three-times Formula One world champion, died from injuries sustained during the San Marino Grand Prix on May 1. He was covered against death and injury by a personal accident policy, underwritten by insurance companies and Lloyd's syndicates. Typically, policies cover annual income and medical and other expenses. Additional multi-million dollar insurance claims are also expected to emerge on so-called 'death and disgrace' policies, which at least some of Senna's sponsors are understood to have taken out to cover any loss of advertising revenue and extra expenses resulting from his death or injury. One of these policies is thought to provide cover of at least Dollars 5m. A range of other companies also insured the value of endorsements - given by Senna in return for a fee - to their products. The personal accident payout looks likely to be the highest ever by insurers for a sportsman and is expected to lead to a contraction in this highly specialised corner of the insurance market. Senna's death came just a day after that of fellow grand prix driver Roland Ratzenberger at San Marino, and only a week after the death of another sportsman, the boxer Bradley Stone. Stone collapsed last week hours after an unsuccessful challenge for the British super bantamweight title. Annual premium income from sports professionals' personal accident premiums is estimated to amount to about Pounds 20m, of which between 10 per cent and 15 per cent is generated by racing drivers. Professional soccer players account for up to 40 per cent of the total. Previous heavy claims include Dollars 14m paid to an American footballer paralysed after sustaining critical injuries. 'This is one of the largest personal accident losses of any sportsman,' one broker said, predicting that rates could rise by up to 20 per cent. Senna, who was widely regarded as one of the best and safest grand prix drivers, is understood to have paid about Dollars 500,000 for a policy which covered accident and medical expenses. For the personal accident element of the policy, the basic rate of 0.75 per cent (of the sum insured) was at the lower end of the range of rates charged to racing drivers.</p>

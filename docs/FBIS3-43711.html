			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Sean Feely] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Jan 12 SAPA -- The mining industry  would have to be revamped to maximise its foreign exchange  earning and employment creation potential, according to a draft  African National Congress [ANC] economic policy document  finalised Wednesday. In addition, the document states the  country's minerals belong to the nation as a whole and urges a  reversal of the current private ownership of mineral rights.  However, this would not be through nationalisation.    Speaking at an international executive communications  conference in Johannesburg, ANC mineral and energy policy  co-ordinator Paul Jourdan released details of the final draft of  the reconstruction and development programme [RDP] completed  Wednesday morning. The RDP put forward as a priority the further  benefication of the country's minerals in order to boost foreign  exchange earnings and increase the number of jobs in the mining  industry. "Exporting raw ore is not benefiting our country in  terms of employment and in terms of earing forex," Mr Jourdan  said.    The document also recognised industries involved in  exploiting mineral resources were in long-term decline and an  effort to move further downstream into fabrication activities  would help alleviate the inevitable job losses.    The RDP suggested the creation of incentives to encourage  benefication such as a form of royalty payment that was  dependent upon the further processing of ore.    The establishment of a mineral marketing auditing office to  control transfer pricing is also mooted.    "We're thinking of a hit-squad that looks at transfer  pricing  of inputs and outputs by companies and takes them to the courts  if necessary," Mr Jourdan explained.    Import-parity pricing by sa mineral producers would be  scrapped and replaced with less expensive export- or  profit-parity pricing to benefit domestic fabricators.    Underlying the reform of the mining industry, is changing  the  pattern of private ownerhsip and control of mineral rights. Mr  Jourdan said this could involve a tax on mineral rights;  expropriation on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis; and  exchange through a system of licenses. He denied this would  involve nationalisation but admitted it could be perceived as a  "legislative, sleight-hand" form of nationalisation.    In addition, the RDP suggested the creation of a black  mining  house through the sale of assets by private mining houses.    The two key obstacles to small-scale mining would also be  removed; namely, the lack of access to mineral rights, and the  inadequacy of financing and technical support.    The RDP document, drawn up by the ANC in conjunction with  the  Congress of SA Trade Unions and the SA National Civics  Organisation, is to be discussed and amended, if necessary, at a  conference later this month and adopted as official ANC economic  policy, he said.    The full RDP document on the economy is expected to be  released later Wednesday or Thursday.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Banana boffins win research prize Researchers in west Africa have won an international award for breeding a better banana. Development of a high-yielding strain resistant to the devastating black sigatoka disease, has attracted the 1994 King Baudouin Award for the most outstanding agricultural breakthrough of the year. The research should lead to higher food output and a significant increase in the incomes of millions of African farmers. Named after the late Belgian monarch, the award is presented by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, a world-wide research network. It goes to the Ibadan, Nigeria-based International Institute for Tropical Agriculture. Bananas are one of Africa's most important staple foods, exceeding maize, rice and cassava in value. In Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, per capita banana consumption averages 200kg a year. But black sigatoka, a fungus disease, spreads rapidly in the wind and can destroy up to half a farmer's crop. Breeders face the problem that bananas do not produce seeds. 'When we started the research, eight years ago, people thought we could not make any progress in breeding bananas,' said IITA director-general Mr Lukas Brader. Using a combination of approaches, scientists at the institute were able to make a breakthrough in breeding technology, which led to a hybrid of plantain banana, a variety used for cooking, that yields two to three times as much as existing varieties and is resistant to black sigatoka. Following trials in 12 sub-Saharan countries, the hybrids are soon to be released to farmers. The hybrids have the advantage of not needing pesticide and they grow faster than existing varieties. The higher yields are expected to reduce the need to expand banana cultivation to other land areas. 'Over the next eight to ten years these hybrids will gradually replace the existing varieties', said Mr Brader. The annual value of banana production in Africa is now estimated at Dollars 2.8bn, but this could increase to Dollars 9bn if the hybrids are widely planted. Mr Ismail Serageldin, CGIAR chairman and World Bank vice-chairman, said millions of small African farmers and their families would benefit. 'This is truly a milestone contribution toward stemming the long-term decline of per capita food production in sub-Saharan Africa', he said.</p>

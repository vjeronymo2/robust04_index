			<p>941216 FT  16 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Reliance Security Improved market conditions enabled Reliance Security Group to lift interim pre-tax profits by 50 per cent from Pounds 991,000 to Pounds 1.49m. Turnover was up 14 per cent to Pounds 40.2m, against Pounds 35.3m. Mr Brian Kingham, chairman of the security services group, said the significant rise reflected recovery from recession, benefits of economies of scale and lower costs through investment in advanced operating systems. Earnings per share were 4.4p (3p) and the interim dividend is stepped up from 1.1p to 1.4p.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taiyuan, April 23 (XINHUA) -- Three provinces in  northern, south-western and central China have been benefited  economically by their regional cooperation over the past decade.    Shaanxi, Shanxi and Henan, three neighboring provinces along  the middle reaches of the Yellow River, are now expanding their  cooperation in all aspects of economy, especially in transport,  energy and chemical industries, as well as agriculture.    The provinces share a triangle plain area, where the Yellow  River flows south and then turns east. Covering a total of  40,000 square kilometers, the triangle area has 30 countries and  cities with a population totalling 11 million.    Although they have been neighbors along the Yellow River,  the  provinces had never had any cooperation with one another,  because they had been under independent regional administrations  in China. Provinces and autonomous regions in different  administrational regions hardly cooperated in economy or culture  in the past.    It was not until 1986 that some departments of the State  Council initiated a plan for the three provinces to start  economic cooperation in the triangle area.    With further reforms and opening up, China has encouraged  regional cooperation across the country. So far dozens of  provinces and cities have expanded cooperation with their  neighbors.    The on-going cooperation involving the south-western  provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan and Guizhou has promoted the local  economies. The same is true for the cooperation schemes  embracing provinces and cities on the middle and lower reaches  of the Chang Jiang River and around Bohai Bay. They are now  playing a crucial role in the economy of the whole of China.    Given best opportunities for regional cooperation at the  time, the three neighbors along the Yellow River have worked out  a scheme together to promote their local economy, especially in  the triangle area.    Costing more than 100 million yuan, the Sanmenxia Bridge  across the Yellow River started to be used at the end of last  year. It now contributes much to the coal transport from  Shanxi, a province abundant in coal, to Henan where power energy  is in short supply.    In the past, coal was carried across the Yellow River by  ferry. An annual amount of only 600,000 tons of coal was  ferried. Passengers would wait two or three hours to queue up  for the ferry.    The 1,300-meter bridge has not only put an end to the ferry  between the two provinces across the Yellow River, but also  links up with a national highway leading from Hohhot City in  northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Beihai City  in south-west China's Guangxi Autonomous Region.    Another big bridge now being built across the Yellow River  in  the triangle area is expected to improve the traffic conditions  in the area after it is put into use this October.    The three provinces have technological cooperation as well  to  promote their major industries. A total of one billion yuan has  been invested in their industrial and agricultural projects.    Three thermal power plants with a total annual generating  capacity of six million kw have been set up in the provinces.  Large plants for aluminium, synthetic ammonia, phosphate  fertilizers and urea have been built as well.    The provinces have also upgraded their low-yield land and  land bordering the Yellow River.    Over the past decade, the trade between the cities and  counties in the triangle area has amounted to more than 300  million yuan.    The gross product of the region now is twice the 1985  figure,  and its general industry and agriculture product is 3.4 times  the figure of 1985.</p>

Franco  guaranteed that "the government will not hesitate in using the  instruments it is entitled to use by law to guarantee compliance  with constitutional obligations," and he said: "Democracy must  be tolerant with the expression of ideas but it cannot remain  inactive in the face of deliberate disorderly actions."    Itamar Franco began his message -- a rendering of accounts  of  his government's action -- speaking about corruption. "The past  12 months served as a painful examination of our political  customs and the ethical behavior of a considerable part of the  business elites," he said. He did not, however, delve deeper  into the subject. "I excuse myself, on account of the natural  pressures of the post I hold, from commenting on the behavior of  those involved."    The president of the Republic then referred to the  constitutional revision and said: "States and municipalities  must have greater political and administrative  responsibilities." He then made mention of the deterioration of  the [word indistinct] state and of some sectors of society" [no  opening quotation mark as published] as the result of inflation.  "The currency reflects the moral standard of society and the  strength of the states," Franco wrote, before asking congressmen  to support the economic stabilization measures: "The executive  branch counts on your patriotism so that it will not lack the  legal instruments needed to implement the measures that are  being and will be adopted in the next few months." Franco ruled  out any possibility of an economic shock that, he said, "would  only help discredit the state and further erode our currency."    When mentioning the restructuring of the state by the  Constituent Congress, President Itamar Franco's tone became  graver. He said that through the years "corporate groups ensured  a privileged position for themselves," and he warned: "Without  intending to intervene in the other government branches  (legislative and judicial), it is my duty to warn them of the  imminent danger the state and society run if we are unable to  begin a fairer distribution of wealth." Franco then gave some  figures that, according to him, "cause us shame and scare us,"  like the loss of 50 percent of Brazilian workers' purchasing  power in the past 30 years.</p>

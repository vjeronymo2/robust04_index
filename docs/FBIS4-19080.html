			<p>BFN     [Text] Government spokesman Evangelos Venizelos said today  that Greece regrets the incident on the Greek-Albanian border  and stressed that when real incidents occur, Greece is willing  to cooperate to clear up the issue on the level of the judicial  authorities. Venizelos noted that Greece will not get carried  away by the climate of tension cultivated by the Albanian side,  because its goal is to safeguard peace in the southern Balkans.    The spokesman added that the only information Greece has in  connection with these incidents is that provided by the Albanian  side. Venizelos added: No one can rule out the existence of  extremist elements but these are elements that are handled by a  state that operates in an excellent fashion. The spokesman  concluded by saying that Greece will accept no provocation  against it.</p>

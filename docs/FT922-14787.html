			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / The Lex Column: Gilts Mr John Smith's shadow Budget has already won top marks for sleight of hand by fudging privatisation receipts and introducing leasing for rolling stock on the North Kent line. So it would be natural for him to be preparing a list of similar wheezes for use in case he is chancellor in a week's time. One obvious choice would be to abolish the rule whereby purchases of gilts by banks and building societies do not count towards funding the PSBR. Such a change would not reduce the crude PSBR figure, but it could be funded with fewer sales of gilts. The Treasury's long-standing objection is that the change would be inflationary, but no other industrial country shares this worry. Besides, at slightly under 6 per cent, the annual growth of M4 money supply is at its lowest point since 1970. If inflationary expectations were heightened, the effect on gilt yields would surely be offset by lower supply. Annual purchases of gilts by banks and building societies currently amount to only about Pounds 1bn. That is small in relation to Mr Smith's expected PSBR of some Pounds 30bn. But, having burnt their fingers in the property market, banks might not need much persuading to step up their activity. The attraction to them is that holdings of government debt require minimal allocation of capital under Basle rules. The worry for the rest of us is that bank money diverted to Mr Smith would not be available to finance private sector recovery. The price could be a credit crunch if he decides to let himself off the funding hook too easily.</p>

			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Travelers declines in quarter TRAVELERS, the US composite insurer, revealed that second-quarter underlying profits had slipped 23.7 per cent to Dollars 74.8m from Dollars 98m in the same period of last year. An extraordinary gain in the 1992 quarter and a one-time charge a year earlier reduced the decline to 14.3 per cent, bringing reported net income to Dollars 77.7m, or 70 cents a share, against Dollars 90.7m, or 85 cents, last year. Results from Travelers' life and pensions businesses are still suffering from real estate difficulties, with a higher level of underperforming mortgage loans and lower interest rates reducing net investment income. Profits from property-casualty operations, however, improved in the quarter in spite of severe catastrophe losses suffered by the industry as a whole. Mr Edward Budd, chairman and chief executive, said the decline in interest rates had increased the market value of Travelers' fixed-income portfolio to Dollars 23.2bn - or Dollars 1bn above book value. Catastrophes reduced earnings by Dollars 18m after-tax, compared with Dollars 11m last year. Underperforming real estate grew by about 2 per cent to Dollars 5.2bn from Dollars 5.1bn at the end of this year's first quarter. The real estate valuation reserves stood at Dollars 871m at the end of the second quarter. Net profits from the property-casualty commercial lines slipped to Dollars 58.7m from Dollars 62.4m a year ago, while personal lines rose to Dollars 15.9m from Dollars 7.8m. Life, health and annuities made a net gain of Dollars 15.8m, compared with Dollars 9m last year, while managed health care/employee benefits produced earnings of Dollars 16m, against Dollars 20m the previous year. Premiums totalled Dollars 1.6bn, compared with Dollars 1.9bn last year, while net investment income fell to Dollars 713m from Dollars 846m. For the first half of 1992, Travelers recorded a decline in net income to Dollars 140.8m, or Dollars 1.27, compared with Dollars 183.8m, or Dollars 1.74, in the same period of 1991. Earlier this week Cigna, one of the largest composite insurers in the US, unveiled underlying second-quarter earnings of Dollars 1.09 a share, compared with Dollars 1.88 in the same period of 1991. Mr Wilson Taylor, Cigna's chairman, blamed the shortfall on weak worldwide property and casualty markets and high catastrophe losses.</p>

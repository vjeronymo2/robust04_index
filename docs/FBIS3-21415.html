			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Atiliu Judiu on interview with Hasan al-Turabi; </F> place and date not given: "We Have No Dealings with Iran, Not  Even One Dollar's Worth!"]    [Excerpts] Hasan al-Turabi, in an interview conducted with  him recently, said: "The secession of the south would be worse  than what is happening in Somalia. The northern part of Sudan  would consider neglecting the south to be an unforgivable crime,  even though the north's area is equal to that of France and  Italy together. Sudan must also remain a united and  nonfragmented country. In the past, in Europe wars broke out  between the nations there, but today Europe is a single entity.  Perhaps the day will come when Africa will be united as a single  entity. We Africans need unity more than Europe does, and we  must overcome nationalisms that are based on the mentality of  the existence of borders."    He said that there are wars going on in the south between  competing rebel groups and that this is making it difficult for  the inhabitants to freely vote for their future during  elections. He added: "We must also consult the inhabitants of  the south who have fled to the north in order to take refuge  there. And we do not know whether or not the federal solution  for the three provinces in the south would be the best way to  put a stop to the violence." [passage omitted]    In response to a question regarding Sudan's isolation due to  allegations of terrorist connections to Iran, al-Turabi replied:  "We have no dealings with Iran, not even one dollar's worth." He  went on to say: "There are no Iranian tourists in Sudan, nor is  there a single [Iranian] soldier or military attache [in Sudan].  The majority of Iranians are Shiites, whereas the majority of  the Sudanese are Sunnis. The two nations are Islamic nations on  the political level. We in Sudan are concerned about Islamic  values in our education, economy, and politics, whereas in Iran,  Islamic values are utilized as slogans for a revolution. Sudan  has no tradition of terrorism, and no one has ever been a victim  of a political attack."    In reply to a question about whether or not his country  would  accept political refugees such as members of the banned Algerian  terrorist groups, al-Turabi replied: "There are four or five  Algerians in Sudan who came to our country from Libya. They  actually are refugees, but not political refugees. There are  also other refugees in our country: 750,000 refugees from  Ethiopia, a million refugees from Nigeria and Uganda, and about  250,000 Palestinian refugees, of whom some are from the Hamas  movement and others are supporters of 'Arafat. We also have  200,000 Egyptians, some of whom work here." Al-Turabi wondered:  "If Sudan is, for example, more Islamic on the political level  than Egypt is, does that make it more suspect?" He also asserted  that he does not consider himself to be basically a  fundamentalist or an Islamic extremist.    He said: "The implementation of Islam in Sudan is not just a  cultural movement, but is also an intellectual movement, which  has the goal of creating a new expression of Islamic values in  order to solve contemporary problems. The goal of our efforts is  to achieve what is best for our country's economy and  agriculture and to eliminate political corruption. Our goal is  to have moral values and unity among our tribes and religious  groups in a single society. We do not have expansionist or  military goals, nor do we have any goals that are financial or  connected with the media."    What about Sudan's relations with Egypt and Algeria, who are  experiencing a wave of terrorist attacks waged by Islamic  extremists and whose governments assert that foreign elements  are responsible for this? Al-Turabi replies: "Any modern  movement in a given society has to know how to conduct itself  vis-a-vis the government in power. If the government dominates  it, then this will generate resistance, and a revolution might  be necessary. This is why the French revolution occurred. But if  there is freedom, even to a limited degree, then it is better if  there is normal progress in the direction of Islam instead of  revolution. Islam is a religion, and there must take place the  occurrence of real and gradual progress toward it. In Algeria,  the majority voted for the Islamic movement in its elections,  but the army prevented its taking power. The Algerians are a  mountain people and thus reject any form of coercion, just as  they did when resisting French `imperialism.' Unfortunately, the  struggle between the goverment and the opposition is something  that is squandering all the energy of the people and the  country. I hope that Algeria will have at least a minimum of  freedom and equilibrium. However, the imposition of Islam by  force would not do any good." In conclusion, al-Turabi said:  "The jihad means defending oneself, not waging a war. We cannot  win people's hearts by means of imposing Islam by force. If  belief [in Islam] is something superficial, then Islam will  attract only hypocrites and not [true] Muslims. I am a religious  person and do not like the use of force."</p>

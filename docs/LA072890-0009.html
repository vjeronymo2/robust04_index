			<p><P> July 28, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PERSPECTIVE ON THE ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> FIRE DANGERS ARE KNOWABLE, SO MAKE THEM KNOWN;  </P> <P> PERIODIC CANYON BLAZES ARE NATURAL. THE DEGREE OF RISK SHOULD BE DISCLOSED TO  HOME BUYERS DURING PURCHASE.  </P> <P> We learned about the Santa Barbara Painted Cave fire from BBC television news  in London. A few phone calls later, friends told us that our house lay in the  path of the fire if the winds shifted and continued to blow, and we took the  next plane home.  </P> <P> Helpless for 10 hours at 30,000 feet, I had plenty of time to think about risks  and our environment in Southern California, risks that we all face. After we  reached home and discovered that the winds had died in time and our house was  standing, we talked with friends and acquaintances who had lost their houses in  the fire, a tragedy that has affected everyone in Santa Barbara. One of the  most poignant aspects was how many people seemed surprised and shocked that  they lived in a high-risk area.  </P> <P> People who come to Southern California seem to assume that society -- the  government or some institution -- has determined that the house they buy is in  a safe location. People who have moved here from the urban East have told me  that it never occurred to them that their house would be in danger. But those  of us who study the environment can read the terrain and see that there are  plenty of homes in Southern California in high-risk locations.  </P> <P> We live in a Mediterranean climate where the native vegetation -- the scrubby,  dense bush called chaparral -- has evolved to endure in a fire-prone habitat.  If it does not burn, chaparral vegetation eventually becomes old, its growth  slows or ceases and the plants die back. Only a fire rejuvenates an area,  promoting new root-sprouting and allowing seed germination, so chaparral plants  produce an abundance of fuel that tends to promote fires on an average of every  several decades.  </P> <P> So we know that we live in an area where fire is natural and where its natural  rate of occurrence in any one spot is about every 30 to 50 years. A house high  up the hillside, surrounded by chaparral, is a higher fire risk.  </P> <P> Mel Manalis, a physicist at UC Santa Barbara and a specialist on wind energy,  says that the landscape also determines where the windiest spots are likely to  be. Air, like water, flows downslope, following low-lying canyons. The Painted  Cave fire spread this way, moving rapidly downslope, more or less along lower  channels in the topography. A house in one of these airsheds is also at higher  risk for fire.  </P> <P> Most of us don't have the expertise or the time to learn how to read the  landscape when we shop for a house. But house-buying in California requires a  complete disclosure of defects by the seller. We could add to the list of  disclosure items the relative environmental fire risk, on a scale from one  (almost none) to five (very high). The fire department or another government  agency with expertise would determine the rating.  </P> <P> People have asked me whether there should be zoning or regulations to prevent  house construction in high-fire zones. My answer is: We need to divide the  risks we face into two categories -- risks that affect only us, and risks that,  if we accept them, also impose additional risks on others. For example, if we  choose to build a house well up in the mountains, far from other houses, then  the risk is pretty much ours alone. As long as homeowners understand it, and  can obtain insurance, then we can justify allowing people to take such risks.  </P> <P> In contrast, suppose you build a house in a high-fire neighborhood and insist  on cedar shingles. This imposes additional fire hazards on your neighbors as  well as yourself. It would seem fairest to use zoning regulations to prevent  that non-voluntary sharing of risks.  </P> <P> Of course, fires are not the only environmental risks we face in southern  California. Three other important ones are flooding, mudslides and earthquakes.  When I first came to California I was amazed to see houses built on small flood  plains in tight canyons where, if an infrequent flood occurs, houses would be  rapidly inundated and residents would have little chance of escape because of  the steep sides of the flood plain. I was also amazed to see houses  cantilevered out on on unstable slopes. Disclosure during house buying should  also rate the risk of flooding and mudslides.  </P> <P> Some may ask why we can't eliminate the risk of chaparral fires. I suppose we  could, if we were willing to pave the hillsides, but then why live here? Didn't  most of us choose this part of the world in part because of its beauty?  </P> <P> We can't realistically eliminate the risk of chaparral fires. But we can  increase awareness and develop policies so that each citizen knows the risks.  </P> <P> Let us hope that it is a long time until the next fire, and that during that  time we improve the ways in which we approach the risks that are part of the  environment in Southern California.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OCCIDENTAL;  </P> <P> VETERAN TEAM LOOKS LIKE A TITLE  </P> <P> They are teams of similar experience and, Coach Jeff Henderson hopes, similar  destiny.  </P> <P> The Occidental College baseball team begins the 1990 season Saturday at  Westmont with more veteran players than any Tiger club since 1982 -- the year  Occidental won its last Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference  championship.  </P> <P> Henderson, in his fifth season as Occidental's coach, was a second baseman for  the 1982 champions.  </P> <P> "We had a lot of four-year starters that year and this year we do too,"  Henderson said. "There's a camaraderie that develops with a group like that.  They've been together a long time working hard toward a goal.  </P> <P> "The SCIAC title is a realistic goal for us this year."  </P> <P> The Tigers have every player back from a team that finished 22-17 overall and  10-8 in the SCIAC last season. Among them are pitcher Dave Stoll and infielder  Tom Bonetto, both of whom were selected first team all-conference.  </P> <P> Stoll, a 5-foot-11, 175-pound sophomore left-hander, was 8-3 with a 3.39  earned-run average as a freshman and led the conference with 82 strikeouts in  85 innings.  </P> <P> Bonetto, a senior who is a four-year starter, led the conference in batting  last season with a .434 average and was selected second-team All-American. This  season, he moves from second base to third to make way for junior Mark Dalton  (.207)  </P> <P> Other veterans include junior shortstop Mark Harris (.370), sophomore first  baseman Mike Bonetto (.354 and a conference-leading 10 home runs) and senior  catcher Mike Knisely (.314). All three players were second-team all-conference  selections in 1989.  </P> <P> "One of our goals in the off-season was to strengthen the pitching staff  through recruiting," Henderson said, "and I think we were successful."  </P> <P> Rich Mather, a freshman right-hander from Corona del Mar, and junior  right-hander Mark Teitelman, a transfer from Johns Hopkins, are expected to  have the greatest impact. They join senior right-handers Rob Drew and Isidro  Rodriguez and junior right-hander Jason Rusk.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Haydar Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, "prime minister </F> of the Democratic Republic of Yemen," by Khalil Matar in New  York; date not given]    [Text] [Matar] Can you assess your current tour, and what  have you achieved in it?    [Al-'Attas] As you know, we met today with Secretary General  Butrus-Ghali and his representative Lakhdar Brahimi. We also  met with the Security Council chairman, Oman's representative  Ambassador Salim al-Khusaybi, and a group of the council's  members. During these meetings we explained our views regarding  conditions in Yemen. Discussions focused primarily on an  immediate cease-fire and a halt to the bloodshed, especially as  northern forces have recently focused on civilians, hitting  primarily residential areas, social establishments, schools,  hospitals, markets, and mosques.    Then we discussed the need to secure an effective mechanism  to watch and consolidate the cease-fire.    As for the second issue which was discussed, it is the need  for humanitarian aid for our people, especially in Aden  Governorate, where people are suffering water and electricity  cuts and the disruption of health services and other life  necessities. I can say that the talks were positive. I hope  that our meetings with these and other parties will continue in  order for the council to adopt resolutions to implement  Resolution 924.    I would like also to say that we expressed our complete  willingness to accept a cease-fire without any conditions, to  agree on a suitable mechanism, and to engage in the dialogue  stipulated by the Security Council resolution.    [Matar] But as Sanaa is intransigent and is refusing to  engage in a dialogue with you, how will you be able to secure a  formula acceptable to the northern government?    [Al-'Attas] I believe that there is no justification for  Sanaa to reject a cease-fire or accept one and then try to get  around it. We have always stressed that the war is harmful and  undermining unity. It is also aimed at (hitting) democracy and  the development march in Yemen. As you have been following  developments in the war, you know how Sanaa began to hit vital  economic installations, starting with the historic Aden  refinery, which is a vital installation, among others. Sanaa's  position is not patriotic and does not reflect a humanitarian  position toward the Yemeni people. This is why I am confident  that the international and Arab position is capable of  compelling Sanaa to return to the right path.    I said at the beginning of the war, and I repeat it now,  that  the courageous and patriotic decision required now is to  announce a cease-fire.    [Matar] Is there any possibility of returning to unity?    [Al-'Attas] War severs all ties, and the longer it goes on,  the fewer ties will remain. This is why we have since the war  broke out said that the road the Sanaa leadership has been  following is wrong and detrimental to unity and the Yemeni  people. It is also harmful to the Yemeni people's future and  life and to the fraternal bonds and ties among the one Yemeni  people. This is why we should confront what results from this  unity courageously and with patriotic responsibility. [sentence  as published]    [Matar] Can you explain to us what exactly is required so  that there can be a possibility of returning to unity?    [Al-'Attas] I believe that we as a Yemeni people in the  north and the south need a period of time to recover from the  effects of this war.    [Matar] Does mean that the war has affected the general  popular position on unity, whether or not 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  remains in power?    [Al-'Attas] The war has affected everything. It is bringing  nothing but tragedies. The Yemeni people know that this war is  not imposed by the Yemeni people. It is imposed by an  influential tribal-military group in Sanaa. In Sanaa itself  people say this war is the Hashid tribe's war, not the people's  war.    When fatwas [rulings] are issued -- repudiating the  cease-fire, analyzing the reasons for continuing the war, and  considering whatever is seized as war booty -- it means that  they consider the south their booty. You can imagine the  reaction of all our people in both the north and the south when  they hear such statements. I would like to recall some events  in our history and say that today is similar to yesterday. In  the imam's days fatwas like these were issued. So today is like  yesterday. The mentality which harmed unity and advocated the  annexation of the south to the north is still in control. It is  a view of hegemony and domination among that group.    [Matar] Some time ago you pointed to the arrest of some  Iraqi military personnel who were fighting alongside northern  forces. You also spoke about the north's alliances with  fundamentalist parties, and so on. How do you view these links  and how do you prove they exist?    [Al-'Attas] Sanaa is currently clearly allying with Iraq and  fundamentalists. It is seeking to set up a new axis and new  powers in the region in order to become a source of disruption  for the region's security and the security of the Arab homeland  as a whole. And as Yemen represents a strategic position on Bab  el Mandeb, Sanaa could -- then -- disrupt world security.    The Iraqi role has increased recently, and a number of  people  were arrested during one of the battles. These Iraqis come  under various names like teachers, engineers, health assistants,  and so on. And there is now among northern forces a number of  Iraqi experts.    As for the fundamentalist movement's role, it is increasing  in Sanaa. And this represents 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih's other face  in his numerous alliances. In our view, these alliances pose a  threat not only to Yemen, but to the region and its stability as  well.    [Matar] And did you sense any U.S. understanding of this  threat?    [Al-'Attas] There is understanding...yes, there is  understanding and awareness of what is happening.    [Matar] The U.S. State Department's statement, which  considered the bombardment of Aden a violation of Resolution  924, represents a change in the U.S. position. But this change  remains slow with regard to recognizing the Democratic Republic  of Yemen and confronting the government in Sanaa. Will this  change continue?    [Al-'Attas] I believe that the U.S. position has from the  outset been positive and balanced. And the U.S. Adminstration's  focus on securing and consolidating a cease-fire is a good step.  Washington actually believes that unity cannot be imposed by  force. It also says that no decision on Yemen's future can be  taken in war conditions. It is a balanced position. But  regrettably, the other side in Sanaa has not responded to it.  It has continued the war despite the Security Council  resolution.    As for the administration saying that the bombardment of  Aden  represents a violation of the resolution, it is a big  development in the U.S. position, which is balanced and  consistent with its positions since the crisis broke out. I  expect the U.S. position to develop in the same direction until  a real and complete cease-fire has been imposed -- a cease-fire  that allows a peaceful dialogue between the two sides to tackle  political conditions.    [Matar] Will the U.S. position reach the stage of  recognizing you officially?    [Al-'Attas] I believe that the main mission discussed  between us and the Security Council members is the cease-fire.    [Matar] Why has not a single state recognized you openly?    [Al-'Attas] Because the main mission is the cease-fire.</p>

The same source reports that all of Armenia's  attempts of advance forward have been stopped. Sustaining  tremendous losses, the Armenian units were forced to retreat to  their previous positions. The Press-centre of the Defense  Ministry denied information from Armenian sources saying that in  the northern Kelbadzharskiy region 300 Azeri soldiers were  surrounded. According to the Azeri Defense Ministry, the  Armenian Army only placed some orderlies on a predominant hill  and shelled the road connecting the Northern section of the  Kelbadzharskiy region (which is controlled by the Azeri Army)  with the remaining regions of the republic.</p>

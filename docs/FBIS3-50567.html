			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Miguel Angel Rouco -- Copyright CLARIN, 1993] </F>   [Text] Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo will step up his  offensive against the rebel provinces that refuse to join the  Fiscal Pact sponsored by the government. Cavallo has said that  those provinces which do not join the pact will lose investments  and employment compared to those that join the pact. The  minister issued a memorandum that will be released tomorrow at  the cabinet meeting in which he states that whatever happens in  the rebel provinces "will be their responsibility." His  offensive takes place amid increasing complaints from state  unions in the interior. Yesterday President Menem called the UCR  [Radical Civic Union] "demagogic" because of its criticism of  the economic plan.    The provinces that do not join the pact will have no  investments, will not create new employment opportunities, but  will on the contrary see current employment vanish because of  the higher costs in the productive area compared to their sister  provinces that join that commitment.    This is the idea that Domingo Cavallo wants to push through  tomorrow at the national cabinet meeting. The minister intends  to increase the pressure on the indolent provinces (the main one  being Cordoba, the minister's birthplace, where all negotiations  to include it have failed).    The minister issued a memorandum, to which CLARIN had  access,  which he intends to distribute tomorrow among his counterparts.  In it Cavallo stresses the importance of the transfer to the  provinces of the heavy decisionmaking powers concerning the  economic policy. The pact authorizes the provincial governments  to make decisions of strategic economic nature.    The idea of the economic team is clear: "What happens in the  provinces that do not sign the pact will be the responsibility  of the provincial governments," according to an official close  to the minister's office.    Cavallo's offensive is based on the unstable socioeconomic  situation affecting several provinces. The situation in the  interior of the country became evident amid violent social  incidents that took place in Santiago del Estero two weeks ago  and which included the burning of Government House, the  Legislative Assembly, and the Court buildings.    Starting with that social outbreak, state unions from  different provinces strengthened their demands against the  adjustment plans, demands which continue without a solution.    Cavallo will propose tomorrow at the cabinet meeting, among  other things, that relations between the provincial public  sector and the productive area must be strengthened so that tax  policy measures may be directly related to the proposed  objectives.    In this manner, the memorandum adds, decisions on provincial  public policies concerning taxes, infrastructure investments,  and essential public services such as education, health,  security, justice or social assistance will have a new framework  based on production.    According to the Finance Ministry theory, 17 provinces and  the federal capital will be favored in the productive levels  that represent 28,166,659 inhabitants, while other six  jurisdictions will see their economic activities hampered and  their prospects for growth and employment for 4,442,028 people  tarnished.    The document proposes that "tax decisions will no longer  simply imply the stabilization of public accounts. From now on,  in the provinces that signed the pact, the provincial  governments will guide the productive level and will be able to  use the most adequate instruments to favor those sectors that  promise to increase the level of employment and production,  because the measures included in the pact seek to favor  competition by cutting costs considerably."    Last week Cavallo signed a detailed report on the accounts  situations of all provinces, a document which he intends to use  should his interpolation in the Chamber of Deputies be confirmed.    In that report, which CLARIN published in an exclusive  manner, Cavallo said the provincial deficits are the result of  the 3 October electoral promises.    The following provinces have not yet signed the fiscal pact:  Catamarca, Cordoba, and Chubut, while Neuquen, Santa Cruz, and  Rio Negro have already announced their adherence.    But the economy minister's intention to influence private  businessmen is also clear: "The many businessmen who wish to  program higher levels of investments will be unable to invest in  those provinces where tax and labor costs will be considerably  higher."    The minister will discuss further those differences,  stressing that in the provinces that sign the pact there will be  reductions in employers contributions on payrolls, which  currently oscillate between 30 and 80 percent. This reduction  is tied by the pact to the exemption of tax on gross income, the  scope of which is between 1 and 1.5 percent.</p>

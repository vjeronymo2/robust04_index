			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" article by Walfredo Angulo: "Summit Meeting or </F> Little White House Games"]    [Text] Following successive failures in trying for decades  to achieve greater control in Latin America, Washington is  convening an inter-American summit in December at a time Latin  American countries are seeking integration plans that do not  include the United States.    In a message at the first meeting of Latin American  presidents, including Spain and Portugal, in Guadalajara,  Mexico, in 1991, Cuban President Fidel Castro stressed the  significance of that meeting being the first one to gather Latin  American heads of state and government without being convened by  the White House.    Regular meetings have followed since July 1991 with the  succeeding summits of Madrid (1992) and Salvador Bahia, Brazil  (1993), conveying the unpostponable need for integration and  regional unity on the brink of the year 2000.    The Caribbean Basin has not been excluded from the  integration process, thanks to the creation of the Association  of Caribbean Nations, which will soon hold a summit of heads of  state and government.    Initiatives that exclude the United States, at a time a  united Europe is emerging as a powerful economic rival, might  have motivated President William Clinton to revive the old idea  of the inter-American summits, tried for the first time almost  40 years ago in Panama and coinciding with the 130th anniversary  of the Amphictyonic Congress called by Simon Bolivar.    A general, Dwight D. Eisenhower, occupied the White House in  1956, while for John Foster Dulles, who was then secretary of  state, his obsession was to try and contain what he called  Soviet expansionism in Europe, and with this same outlook dealt  with the neighboring subcontinent at the First Inter-American  Summit.    These were the years of splendor in Hollywood, the years of  absolute U.S. leadership in the steel and automobile industries.  South of the Rio Grande, dictators, armed and backed by  Washington, led the destinies of numerous countries as if they  were administrators of U.S. ranches.    These realities are offensive 40 years later, but are  nonetheless absolute truths. A brief review of those who  attended the Panama meeting in 1956 confirms the presence of  nine generals and two colonels.    The list would have been longer if Peruvian dictator Manuel  Odria, General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla from Colombia, Gen. Paul  Magliore of Haiti, or members of the Honduran military junta had  attended.    Men who evoke sad memories for Latin America sat beside Gen.  Eisenhower -- dictators who were some of the most faithful U.S.  allies stood out -- Fulgencio Batista (Cuba), Anastasio Somoza  (Nicaragua), Rafael Leonidas Trujillo (Dominican Republic),  Marcos Perez Jimenez (Venezuela), and Alfredo Stroessner  (Paraguay).    The second summit called for by Lyndon Johnson and held in  1967 in Punta del Este, Uruguay, was no less flattering, with  four of the five South American generals. They represented  Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Bolivian Gen. Rene  Barrientos did not attend, and Haiti was represented by Francois  Duvalier.    The noticeable U.S. interest in this meeting was to  strengthen its failed Alliance for Progress and create an  atmosphere of confidence with memories of the 1965 Dominican  Republic invasion still fresh.    Johnson proposed to Latin Americans what he called a  rational  development program to reach "a dream of a renewed America" for  the decade of the seventies.    Twenty-seven years after the Punta del Este summit,  Washington still pursues the old postwar national security  doctrine fostered by the White House, which served to prop up  the area's military regimes and dictatorships.    But now the national security doctrine attempts to attain  agreement in its foreign policy, interpreted as a hegemonic  concept of democratic and economic development as well as  internal security for the area.    Also left behind is Ronald Reagan's Caribbean Basin  Initiative and the Brady Plan -- tariff reductions for Latin  American products and a reduction of the government debt through  privatization of state enterprises, respectively.    For Washington and for South Americans, former President  George Bush's "Enterprise for the Americas Initiative" today too  is a dead letter. Now the question is what new proposal will  the United States make in the area of trade and financing.    For the time being, following President William Clinton's  summons, he is known to want to open "a new era in  Inter-American relations," according to his own words.    The U.S. President's probable bait will be the approval by  the U.S. Congress of NAFTA between Canada, Mexico, and the  United States, the main trump card to show visitors.    The Latin America that will be at the Miami summit will be a  Latin America wishing to find solutions to its scourge of social  inequalities, economic crises, and administrative corruption,  situations that are a contradiction to the very essence of the  weak democracies.    Despite this, the Latin American countries are beginning a  slow integration process, the only route to solving their  pressing problems, a joint unitary effort that has marked the  steps of a difficult path.    If the intention is to improve inter-American relations, it  is impossible to exclude any peoples of the area from these  summits.    For U.S. Senator Jose E. Serrano, who is of Puerto Rican  origin, no area leader can be excluded if one wishes to speak of  consolidating democracies.    And for those who oppose Cuba's presence at the Third  Inter-American Summit, the congressman says that no country on  the subcontinent has the same system of government, and he asks  himself: What is true democracy?</p>

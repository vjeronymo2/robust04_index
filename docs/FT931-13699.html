			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / Management: Business in the back of beyond - Communism's collapse has created profitable chances to bypass Moscow Over the past year, the collapse of the secretive, super-centralised Soviet state has opened up previously undreamed of opportunities for western businessmen to bypass Moscow and deal direct with new decision-makers in the far-flung provinces. At the same time, decentralisation, and the emergence of 15 separate states from the wreckage of the old union has raised the cost and complexity of doing business. Long-established western companies, used to the dreary but familiar round of ministries and endless discussions with bureaucrats in smoke-filled rooms in Moscow, have opened representative offices in new capitals such as Kiev, Tashkent and Alma Ata. For some, the trek in search of new business has taken them to military-industrial plants which two years ago did not officially exist and appeared on no maps. Such was the fate, for example, of Amersham International, the privatised UK-based 'health science company' which last year set up a joint venture with Mayak, a company owned by the Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry, to market radioactive isotopes. These were produced at Chelyabinsk-65, a former top secret military plant in the Urals region. Amersham's experience in setting up the joint venture with Mayak and dealing directly with the local authorities and newly empowered managements in the Urals was instrumental in its subsequent decision to become a core member of the recently formed British Health Care Consortium. The consortium, an effort to take a co-ordinated 'Great Britain PLC' approach to tackling the challenges and opportunities of the post-Soviet market, groups together some of the UK's top pharmaceutical, healthcare and related industries under the chairmanship of Sir Ronald McIntosh, former director-general of the National Economic Development Council. The founder members of the consortium are Glaxo, the Wellcome Foundation, ICI, Amersham International, Smiths Industries Medical Systems and Conder Projects, a specialist in medical construction. The consortium enjoys technical support from the counter-trade department of the London-based Moscow Narodny Bank and close ties with the UK Department of Health. Last month, after visits to its base in Yekaterinaburg as well as Chelyabinsk, Ufa and Izhevsk the consortium and Uraltech, its Russian partner, finalised a Dollars 36m (Pounds 24m) agreement under which BHCC companies will design, build and equip hospitals and clinics. The consortium, drawing on the example of the UK's national health system, will also help reorganise health care provision in a region blighted by decades of ecological neglect, heavily polluting industrial development and the Soviet disregard for public welfare. The deal will be financed from the proceeds of the export of aluminium and other products formerly used largely for arms production. The green light came after the first Dollars 2m flowed into an escrow account at MNB, which after a recent radical restructuring concentrates on services for exporters and investors. With honourable exceptions, UK companies have been slower than other European companies to get involved in the former communist countries. BHCC offers 'piggy-back' access for smaller UK companies in what is expected to be a developing, long-term market in the Urals and eventually other regions with similar needs. 'The consortium itself is not a non-profit organisation and is not an exclusive club. We are willing to associate with any UK company, provided there is no conflict with the core members,' says Sir Ronald. The groundwork for future expansion follows months of frequent visits to Yekaterinaburg, building on political support for the project from Russian president Boris Yeltsin, who was the Communist party boss when the city was called Sverdlovsk. 'The important thing in deals like this is to make sure that you are dealing with reliable people and that the supply of goods required to finance the operation is authorised from the top. All these requirements are met in this case. Aluminium and other products for export are flowing from the Urals to St Petersburg, money is flowing into the escrow account, and a solid basis has been laid for serious business,' says Bill Newman of MNB. The collapse of the old Communist party structures has been followed by the restoration of the former tsarist system of regional and provincial governors appointed by Moscow to act as the central government's eyes and ears in the provinces. Building good relations with the local authorities is crucial to the success of deals involving public services such as health. 'The future of Russia could well be decided at the local and micro-level. It is now possible to do business directly with the movers and shakers in areas like the Urals, which is far from Moscow but has a population of around 25m and growing access to hard currency,' Sir Ronald adds. The importance of close ties with local authorities and enterprises is equally important in areas such as food where UK companies have set up a similar consortium in Ukraine. 'Improving food supply and healthcare are the keys to raising morale and productivity, not just in the Urals but throughout the former Soviet Union. The hunt for food and the need to take care of sick children and relatives are the main causes of absenteeism. Separately, the UK food and health consortia tackle both these key areas head on,' says Bruce Beharrell, who heads Amersham International's Russian operations and is a key figure in the BHCC consortium.  --------------------------------------------------     SELECTIVE BRITISH PROJECTS OUTSIDE MOSCOW  -------------------------------------------------- YEKATERINABURG  -------------------------------------------------- British Health Care Consortium: Glaxo, Wellcome Foundation, ICI, Amersham International, Smiths Industries, Conder Projects  -------------------------------------------------- KIEV  -------------------------------------------------- British Food Consortium  -------------------------------------------------- KARACHAGANAK  -------------------------------------------------- British Gas (Multi-billion dollar exploration project)  -------------------------------------------------- CHELYANBINSK  -------------------------------------------------- Amersham International (Joint venture with former Soviet defence group)  -------------------------------------------------- ALMA ATA  -------------------------------------------------- First joint UK-German embassy  --------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Roman Majetic: "Three Hundred Tonnes of Oil per </F> Day Goes to Serbia From Occupied Djeletovci"]    [Text] "Having collected the information from the Croatian  authorities and the Ina oil company, and after a talk with the  representatives of the Serb authorities in occupied Croatian  territory, I went to the oil fields in Djeletovci to check the  allegations on the spot. Following the investigation, I am  submitting my report to the UN Secretary General. The report  contains conclusive evidence that the Serbs in Sector East, an  occupied part of Croatian territory, have been pumping oil from  the wells at Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca, and shipping it to  the oil refinery in Pancevo near Belgrade, in direct violation  of the UN Security Council Resolution 757...." it says in the  introductory part of the report submitted in late October 1992  to UN Secretary General by John P. Thomas, a US expert engaged  by the United Nations to check the possibility that the embargo  is being violated on the territories under the protection of the  peace forces.  <H5>  Questions With No Answers </H5>   John P. Thomas undertook his investigation following the  frequent complaints of the Croatian Government that, in the  occupied territories in eastern Slavonia, oil is being pumped  daily from the sources in Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca.  Although the Croatian authorities, including the Osijek police,  the government, and parliament, had protested many times, and  asked UNPROFOR to prevent the possible depletion of the oil  fields, there was no specific response, only unspecified  promises. Colonel Alexander Hromchenko, who, during 1992, was  commander of Sector East, promised in early August that he would  carry out an investigation in Djeletovci and inform the public  of the results within a week. However, nothing ever arrived.    Although the Croatian Government asked UNPROFOR many times,  the UN never confirmed whether the Serbs were pumping oil in  Djeletovci. Moreover, although John P. Thomas submitted his  report as early as in October 1992, stating that the Serbs were  pumping oil in the occupied parts of Croatian territory, and  shipping it to Serbia (thus violating the UN Security Council  Resolution 757 on the economic embargo against Serbia), the  Croatian Government has still not been given the information  contained in the report, which GLOBUS is now publishing.    The oil wells in Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca were  occupied by the Serbs in the fall of 1991, at the same time a  great part of eastern Slavonia was occupied. The largest of the  three wells is the one in Djeletovci, which had produced 17  percent of oil in Croatia before the war. Although the Serbs  seized the area as early as in November 1991, the pumping  started only in August 1992. There were several reasons for it,  one of the most important being that the Serbs in that part of  the occupied territory did not manage to establish a regular  water and electricity supply for several months. Moreover,  Djeletovci are near the occupied village of Nijemci, on the  frontline. One of the reservoirs at Opatovac was seriously  damaged during shelling. This is a reservoir for crude oil from  Djeletovci before it is shipped to the refinery.    In spite of all the difficulties, the Serbs made great  efforts to put the oil-pumping plant in working order,  especially after the UN Security Council introduced the economic  embargo against Serbia.  <H5>  Croatian Army Reconnaissance Patrol Reports </H5>   Croatian Army reconnaissance patrols have sent many reports  on activities around the oil wells. They regularly reported on  trucks bringing in equipment, workers installing pumps on  wells.... On the basis of these reports, the Croatian  Government regularly submitted complaints. However, it was not  only the Croatian authorities that asked UNPROFOR to check the  information about the Serbs pumping oil from Croatian oil-wells  in eastern Slavonia. The UNPROFOR headquarters received reports  from its own members on the ground. For instance, L.W. Moore,  UNPROFOR civilian police commander in Sector East, said, in one  of the many reports, in August 1992:    "This investigation was the result of continuing allegations  from the Croatian side that oil fields in the Djeletovci area  which belong to Croatia were being depleted by those in  authority in the UNPA at this time. In support of that  allegation the Croatians advise that the technology used in the  field is so advanced that pumps are not needed at the field and  that oil could be shipped out underground. This matter was  discussed with Osijek police on 4 August 1992 and they advise  that there are pipelines from the field to Opatovac on the  Danube and to Croatia. It is therefore believed that the field  is operating and oil is being pumped to the storage facility in  Opatovac and then moved by tanker or barge to Pancevo near  Belgrade.    In support of the belief of the Croatians, two incidents  were  reported to this HQ by our station in Oriolik. First, on 23  July 1992 our members encountered members of the local police in  the area with a trailer full of pumps. On 30 July 1992 they  responded to a fire at the main office/complex, and learned that  a large oil tank being repaired had accidently caught on fire.  Later they were told that the fire was intentional in an effort  to burn off remaining oil in the tank so that it could be  repaired.    These two incidents clearly indicate that if they are not  actually pumping oil, they intend to. As a result a visit was  made to the pumping complex on 6 August 1992. It was an  informal meeting where coffee was served. In the course of the  conversation the following was learned. First it was rather  evident that at this time no oil is being pumped. The complex  is at present without electricity to move oil either out of the  ground or to pump it to other locations. A fairly small staff  is currently employed at the site during the day only. Their  goal is to get the systems back in place to allow the pumping of  oil, and once that is ready, there will be round-the-clock  operation at the site."    Having described the difficulties the Serbs were facing,  L.W. Moore concluded at the end of his report: "...at present  the oil is not being pumped, but every efforts is being made to  utilize the facility to supply crude oil."  <H5>  Civilian Police Reports </H5>   Although UNPROFOR had been ignoring all the Croatian demands  to investigate if the Serbs were pumping oil at Djeletovci, the  reports made by their civilian police prompted the UN to  consider the instances of obvious violations of the embargo  after all. Thus, on the basis of the Special Service Agreement,  UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali engaged John P. Thomas, a US  expert in oil exploitation, to determine whether oil was in fact  being pumped in eastern Slavonia.    Thomas started working on this in early September 1992. He  spent his first week in Zagreb, where he met with Cedric  Thornberry, who showed him several UNPROFOR civilian police  reports, which supported the thesis that the Serbs were  preparing to exploit the oil wells. Thomas claims that  Thornberry expressed his doubts about the accuracy of the  reports.    Apart from talking to Thornberry and his associates, the US  expert also visited Ina: "I met several very friendly people,  who helped me get the real picture by supplying me with a great  deal of information about the oil wells in eastern Slavonia. I  talked to Mr. B. Jazbec, an engineer with 30 years of experience  in Ina. I also talked to Dr. M. Zelic, production manager in  Ina Naftaplin." After seven days in Zagreb, during which time he  collected information about the oil wells, Thomas decided to  investigate the situation on the ground. "I left for the UNPA  on 14 September. I went to Erdut and stayed at the Sloboda  Hotel, which does not take credit cards.    "Although I had arranged to visit the site the next day,  September 15, the trip was postponed, allegedly because the  local military commanders were too busy. Two days later, during  the first visit, I was denied close access to the oil wells,  allegedly because the entire site had been mined. However, I  obtained the appropriate permits and visited Djeletovci, but was  still denied access to the other two oil-wells.    "Although, during the one day visit to the oil-wells at  Djeletovci, I did not see oil being pumped, the picture of the  overall situation at the pumping site and all the evidence I  have seen and collected undeniably indicate that the Serbs are  pumping oil from the Croatian wells in Sector East. There is no  doubt that the Serbs are pumping oil from the wells at  Djeletovci, and it is almost certain that they are doing so with  the other two wells (Ilaca and Privlaka). It is necessary to  point out that the quantities of oil pumped daily at Djeletovci  are not small. Therefore, the Serbs are not only violating the  UN Security Resolution 757, but they are also causing the  Republic of Croatia considerable material damage."    To support the conclusion of his report, Thomas supplied  several pieces of conclusive evidence: "During one of the  visits I came across a large number of already installed oil  pumps: see-saw pumps (horse-head shaped), hydraulic pumps, gas  pumps.... Some pumps were used for pumping the oil from the  wells, while others were used for loading the oil into cisterns.  Although none of the pumps were working while I was visiting  the wells, it was obvious that they were being regularly used.  There were traces of fresh crude oil near the well, and a lot  of staff around....  <H5>  Oil for Pancevo </H5>   "All the former sources confirmed that the Serbs were facing  two great problems that prevented them from starting to exploit  the oil wells. The first problem was lack of electricity,  without which it was impossible to start some of the pumps.  Another problem was the poor supply of water, which is crucial  for pumping. Namely, the oil in Djeletovci is pumped in a very  simple way: oil reserves, which are below the ground, emerge on  the surface thanks to natural pressure. However, the pressure  gradually becomes weaker, which can cause the oil to stop  flowing. In order to prevent that, water is poured into the  well, which replaces the outflowing oil, and the pressure is  thus maintained. By seeing the situation at the wells in  Djeletovci, I ascertained that the Serbs had solved both  problems and thus started pumping oil from the wells on a  regular basis."    In his report, Thomas also stated accurate estimates on the  quantities of oil that the Serbs were pumping every day:  "Before the war, Croatia pumped about 700 tonnes of crude oil  from the wells at Djeletovci, Privlaka, and Ilaca (255,000  tonnes of oil per year), which was a great part of the total  Croatian oil production.    "With all the difficulties the Serbs faced concerning the  pumping of oil (occasional power failures, lack of expert staff,  being close to the Croatian Army positions), my estimate is that  at least 350 tonnes of oil is pumped at Djeletovci per day,  which is half the prewar production of oil at these wells, which  used to make up to 17 percent of overall oil production in  Croatia.    "Moreover, there are two incidents, mentioned also in the  UNPROFOR civilian police reports, that also confirm that the  wells are being exploited. One of the large reservoirs caught  fire when the Serbs tried to repair it without having completely  emptied it. Another incident mentioned by the UNPROFOR civilian  police is an explosion in the village of Mirkovci near Vinkovci,  in which two people were said to have been killed. The  explosion occured when the Serbs were connecting an extension to  the well in Djeletovci to the pipeline that leads to the  refinery in Pancevo and goes through Mirkovci. They thus  facilitated the underground oil transport straight to the  refinery, and moved the cisterns from the roads, which, until  then, transported the oil before the eyes of UNPROFOR along the  15-mile route from Djeletovci to the storage facility in  Opatovac. From there the oil was transported by barge to a  refinery in Pancevo, which the civilian police reports also  mentioned. Traces of oil near the village of Negoslavci and on  the Djeletovci- Opatovac road (near the village of Sidski  Banovci) corroborate the above mentioned."    Thomas submitted his report to the United Nations in  October 1992, only a month after the exploitation of the wells  had started. At the time, the Serbs were pumping 350 tonnes  from Djeletovci a day, which is half of the well's maximum  capacity. Now, almost two years later, the Serbs continue to  exploit the wells in eastern Slavonia, in which the peace forces  in Sector East are not obstructing them at all.    Moreover, to this day UNPROFOR has not answered the Croatian  Government on whether the Serbs were pumping oil at Djeletovci.  Since the Serbs in the meantime have managed to solve all the  problems concerning the water and electricity supply, it is  estimated that the quantity of oil being pumped at Djeletovci  daily is much greater than the initial 350 tonnes. According to  some estimates of the Ina experts, as much as 900 tonnes of oil  per day are currently being pumped, which is 200 tonnes more  than the anticipated maximum. This exploitation of wells, which  exceeds the needs of the Serbs in the occupied parts of Croatia,  is not only causing great material damage to the Croatian  economy, but, as the experts have stated, it could permanently  destroy the oil wells in eastern Slavonia.</p>

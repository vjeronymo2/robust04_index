			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / The Lex Column: Smaller companies Smaller companies underperformed large capitalisation stocks sharply in the third quarter: while the FT-SE 100 index delivered total returns of 1.6 per cent, the FT-SE SmallCap yielded a 2 per cent negative return. This comes after a long period of outperformance and looks odd given the robust outlook for smaller companies' earnings. Part of the reason for the decline is the market's general listlessness, which has resulted in the limited trading volume being concentrated in large, liquid stocks. Another explanation is that small companies are strongly weighted towards general manufacturing, a sector which has fallen out of favour. Either way, the fall in share prices has served to accentuate small companies' relative attractions at this point in the economic cycle. Profits are set to grow more rapidly than at big companies during 1994 and 1995, yet valuations have become less demanding: the traditional premium over the market as a whole has shrunk. Of course, the outlook for small companies depends critically on prospects for equities as a whole. For those who are sanguine about the general outlook, now is a good moment to seek bargains. The limited marketability of these companies' shares will deter the faint-hearted. But buying amid a general rally in the market at a later date is likely to prove difficult: lack of liquidity would then act as a catalyst to further outperformance.</p>

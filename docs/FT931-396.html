			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hickson back in the black with Pounds 24.3m  -Fine chemicals business showed strongest advance HICKSON International, the speciality chemicals company, returned to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.3m for the year to December 31, against losses of Pounds 4.5m. Sir Gordon Jones, chairman, said the company had spent the last year reorganising its businesses and strengthening management. 'We now know what we are best at,' he said. Hickson had become 'financially secure' following the Pounds 70m rights issue in 1991. Three acquisitions had been made, for a total of Pounds 34.5m, including the Pounds 24m purchase of PharmaChem in Ireland. This had given Hickson an important entry to the pharmaceuticals market, he said. Sir Gordon was cautious about the short-term outlook, warning that economic downturn in Germany would affect profits there, and in the Netherlands and France. About 25 per cent of profits comes from mainland Europe. However, the upturn in the US was expected to offset the European decline. The US and dollar dependent economies are responsible for some 40 per cent of profits. The sharp turnround in pre-tax profits reflected the disposal of the floor coverings business in 1991, which had resulted in a Pounds 19.4m loss that year, and the absence of a Pounds 6.6m provision for environmental liabilities and potential litigation. Under the new accounting standards, these charges must be taken above the line. Pre-tax profits from con-tinuing operations were ahead 85 per cent at Pounds 29.2m. Sales for the group as a whole fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 342.5m, although on-going businesses showed an 11 per cent increase to Pounds 328.2m. The final dividend is maintained at 5.15p, for a total of 8p. Earnings per share were 10.5p, partly helped by a lower tax charge, against losses of 6.7p. On a continuing operations basis, earnings per share rose from 6.1p to 12.7p. Within the group's four divisions, fine chemicals showed the strongest increase with profits ahead 44 per cent to Pounds 15m. PharmaChem contributed Pounds 2.3m. The protection and coatings operation was hit by a sharp decline in Italy and fell 4 per cent to Pounds 9.9m. Performance products fell 12 per cent to Pounds 9m. COMMENT The simplest guide to Hickson's performance might be the decision to maintain the final dividend. The company appears to have suffered a bit in the second half, particularly in Italy. Sir Gordon indicated yesterday that Hickson expected 'relative stability and consolidation' in 1993, in spite of a US recovery. Nevertheless, there might be gains with the three acquisitions, especially PharmaChem. Forecasts are for an increase in pre-tax profits of continuing operations from Pounds 29.2m to Pounds 34.5m this year, after currency gains and organic growth. This leaves the shares up with the sector's rating of about 15 times. Hickson's attractions might become greater when economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic begins to take shape.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by NARODNA ARMIYA correspondent Senior Lieutenant </F> Serhiy Zhurets: "Ukrainian Aviation Has Solid Wings"]    [Text] As we have already reported, Minister of  Defense General of the Army of Ukraine Vitaliy Radetskyy, Deputy  Minister of Defense for Armaments and Armaments Chief of the  Armed Forces of Ukraine Colonel-General Ivan Oliynyk and  Directorate of Industrial Orders and Industrial Liaison Chief  Major-General Viktor Vashchilin visited the aviation scientific  and technical complex (ANTK) imeni Oleh Antonov, which is the  leading scientific and production base of Ukrainian aircraft  construction.    The level of development of science and industry of a nation  has traditionally been defined, and is defined, by achievements  in aviation as well -- both civil and military. The Ukrainian  aviation scientific and technical complex imeni Oleh Antonov has  reason to be proud. It is enough to mention the An-124 Ruslan  and An-225 Mriya aircraft, well known around the whole world.  The "Antonovites" have also done a great deal for the  development of military and military-transport aviation. A whole  family of "An's" has served and is serving in the army: The  An-2, An-8, An-12, An-26. An-30, An-72 and An-124.    But new times advance new demands. The building of effective  and mobile Ukrainian armed forces is simply impossible unless  the army is provided with contemporary models of hardware,  including aviation hardware. That is how to explain the  attention that the leadership of the Ministry of Defense is  devoting to the emergence and development of the Ukrainian  military-industrial complex, with an important place in it  occupied by the ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov.    The deep traditions of aircraft construction, the widespread  use of computer technology in the work and the adoption of new  technologies are providing an opportunity for the Kiev  specialists to develop aviation products that are the equal of  the most advanced international demands. The representatives of  the military department were convinced of that with their own  eyes.    The Minister of Defense devoted considerable attention,  while  being familiarized with the prospects and capabilities of the  ANTK, to the new transport aircraft with the working name of the  An-77. The development and construction of this model is one of  the few examples of very close collaboration between Ukraine and  Russia, based on an international agreement. The An-77 surpasses  the capabilities of analogous aircraft, both civil and those of  military-transport aviation, in both freight capacity and in  speed, altitude and range. Less than half of the necessary  funds, however, were directed toward the requirements of the  An-77 project, as was emphasized by ANTK imeni Oleh Antonov  General Designer Petro Balabuyev. Moreover, the lion's share of  that money was funds that the design bureau had earned through  its own efforts. That is obviously insufficient. The first model  of the new transport aircraft is planned to be ready to go out  to the airfield for trials by the end of the month, and another  model will have to be built and tested for objective results. It  is difficult to say when this will be done. The Ukrainian  aircraft-building industry, after all, is experiencing far from  its best times: Skilled specialists are leaving because of the  poor pay, and the disrupted business ties provide no opportunity  for the timely performance of the necessary work.    Kiev has been visited more than once this year, however,  both  by representatives of the ministries of defense of Great Britain  and France and by representatives of the FLA--an organization of  countries in the European Community to which France, Germany,  Great Britain, Italy and Spain belong. FLA specialists have been  engaged for a long time in the development of a design for an  analogous aircraft; they have not even begun the design  engineering. The Ukrainian aircraft builders, however, have  built the first aircraft, which virtually conforms to the FLA  requirements.    The Kiev ANTK, by the way, can offer the nation and the  armed  forces more than a new transport aircraft. The arsenal of the  design bureau has many more innovations, from a powered hang  glider to an aerospace system based on the widebody Mriya  aircraft as a launch platform. This system provides the  opportunity to put a satellite into space with the assistance of  rockets launched from the An-225 during aircraft flight.  Furthermore, the cost of such a method is only one seventh that  of a conventional vertical launch. And there is no need to  explain the importance of our own satellites for the development  of civil and military space.    Also discussed at the meeting was the fact that the ANTK  imeni Oleh Antonov has an opportunity to take up the resolution  of such problems as the development of trainer aircraft. General  Designer Petro Balabuyev indicated that attention should be  turned to the training of American military pilots. They first  fly for thirty hours on trainer aircraft at the first level of  difficulty, and then 75 hours on aircraft of the second level of  difficulty; only after that do the pilots begin to master the  combat aircraft directly. That way is both safer and more  economical, which is very important under contemporary  conditions when fuel is scarce.    "We are ready to develop such trainer aircraft for the needs  of our military aviation," said Petro Vasylovych. "The need for  them will arise sooner or later, after all."    So then, time will tell what problems they will be able to  solve on the road to a modern, truly effective and mobile army.  But we need to rely on two solid wings--industry and science--in  order to attain that goal as quickly as possible, the more so  with the intelligent expenditure of state funds.</p>

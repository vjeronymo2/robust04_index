			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: French property The comparison between the strains afflicting the French currency and property markets is inexact, but intriguing nonetheless. In both cases the French financial establishment has stepped in to prevent disorderly conduct. But while the franc last week seemed to have scraped through the worst, the property market is running into real strains. Paris rental values have dropped 20 per cent from their peak. About 300,000 square metres of office space will come on to the market this year while vacancy rates are climbing. Some 6 per cent of office space remains unlet. In some areas, such as La Defense, the business district west of Paris, it may be twice that level. Some developers are already squealing. Last week saw another, Pierre Premier, hand over most of its portfolio to the banks. The latter have tried to underpin the market but bad debt provisions have mounted alarmingly. French banks are estimated to have a FFr400bn (Pounds 48.6bn) exposure to the property sector. Nearly a quarter of that lending must now be classified as doubtful. But France's property troubles are not as bad as those that have beset the UK, US or Japan. High interest rates have choked off new development; over-supply is far less than in the UK; the underlying economy is stronger. And the French financial community has shown itself more sophisticated in defending an orderly market. The French property crise is still painful, but it is not so dire as to dampen the economic benefits of lower interest rates when they finally come.</p>

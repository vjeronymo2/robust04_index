			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / British Coal backs National Forest project BRITISH COAL has agreed to support the creation of the National Forest, which would bring into being 200 sq miles of wooded landscape in central England, and tailor land reclamation work towards it. The National Forest development team and the property division of British Coal yesterday published a charter, intended to define their future relationship, which commits British Coal to tree planting as part of its reclamation programmes. The charter represents a shift in British Coal land policy, which previously went against acting in areas where no legal obligation existed. Though British Coal has no obligation to restore land used by pits which started before 1947 - the majority of the landholdings in this case - the charter says: 'British Coal will seek actively the land's restoration in accordance with the National Forest strategy either directly or through a suitable agency.' The forest has government approval, and the Treasury and Department of the Environment are examining the project's business plan. Ms Susan Bell, development director of the project, said the charter was 'absolutely crucial' to the future of the forest. British Coal is the largest landowner in the National Forest area, with 10 per cent. One of the biggest environmental exercises in the UK, the National Forest was conceived by the Countryside Commission in 1987 as a way of transforming areas of Derbyshire, Leicestershire and Staffordshire, which cover one of the oldest UK coalfields. The collieries have closed, but opencast mining continues. Mr Tony Palmer, head of British Coal's property division, said: 'If we've used the land for opencast, we normally have to rehabilitate it. In the past that has tended to be towards agriculture.'</p>

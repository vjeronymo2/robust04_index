			<p><P> March 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORGAN RECEIVES PASSPORT, CAN GO TO NEW ZEALAND  </P> <P> An appeals court Friday returned to Dr. Elizabeth Morgan the passport it had  seized 3 1/2 years ago, allowing her to travel to New Zealand to participate in  an international custody fight for her daughter.  </P> <P> The District of Columbia Court of Appeals turned over the passport to Morgan a  day after a lower court judge, who had jailed Morgan for more than two years  for contempt of court, ruled that releasing the passport "is in the best  interests of the minor child."  </P> <P> Morgan, a plastic surgeon, was not available for comment. Her attorney, Adrian  Roe, refused to comment.  </P> <P> But Morgan had said earlier that, if her passport were returned, she would  immediately travel to Christchurch, New Zealand, for the next phase of a  custody fight for her daughter, Hilary, 7.  </P> <P> Hilary's father, Eric Foretich, 47, a Virginia oral surgeon, is already in New  Zealand trying to gain custody of the child.  </P> <P> Morgan, 42, contends that Foretich sexually abused Hilary, a charge he has  repeatedly denied.  </P> <P> Hilary surfaced last week in New Zealand, where she has been living in  Christchurch since 1988 with her maternal grandparents, William and Antonia  Morgan.  </P></p>

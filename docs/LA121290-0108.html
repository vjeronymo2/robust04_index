			<p><P> December 12, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE: BANKING;  </P> <P> FOUNTAIN VALLEY'S BEACH SAVINGS LOSES MORE TOP OFFICIALS  </P> <P> Beach Savings Bank might need to hang out a "Help Wanted" sign on its window  after the latest round of departures at the small Fountain Valley savings and  loan.  </P> <P> Ernest F. Thompson, in ill health, quit his positions as president and chief  executive last week.  </P> <P> And James E. Rott, the chief financial officer, is expected to leave soon for a  private accounting practice in the Pacific Northwest.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the two-branch thrift lost a controller, an assistant  controller and a branch administrator.  </P> <P> Beach's owner and chairman, Anaheim developer James A. Carter, said he is  concentrating on hiring a new president and will let that person decide what  positions to fill. Rott, he said, has agreed to stay on for up to three months  to help with the transition.  </P> <P> In the current economic slowdown, Carter said, Beach has closed down its  mortgage lending operation, which employed about a dozen people, and has  reduced its assets to about $85 million, from $102 million at the end of June.  </P> <P> The thrift has lost so many employees that a minimum of only two remain at the  S&amp;L's Newport Beach branch. Internal controls, if not regulatory rules,  dictate that an employee from the headquarters office go to the Newport Beach  office whenever one of the branch employees goes to lunch or is otherwise  absent.  </P> <P> Carter, who also owns Corporate Bank in Santa Ana, purchased Beach at the end  of 1986. Previously, he had a tough time trying to buy a thrift. He tried for  two years to purchase an S&amp;L in Alhambra before switching to Beach.  </P></p>

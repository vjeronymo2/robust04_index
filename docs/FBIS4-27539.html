			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- Relays of members of the  Korean Children's Union (KCU) carrying red neckerchiefs to the  great leader Generalissimo Kim Il-song started in cities and  counties throughout the country on the threshold of the 5th KCU  Congress slated for early June here.    Starting ceremonies took place there.    The relay groups were entrusted with red neckerchiefs  carrying the firm resolve of the KCU members to continue forever  on the road of the march starting from Mt. Paektu following the  dear leader Mr. Kim Chong-il like revolutionary forerunners who  had fought bloody battles for long years for the liberation of  the country and for the freedom and emancipation of the people,  flying high the red flag of revolution with President Kim  Il-song in the van of their ranks.    KCU members and people of broad strata warmly sent off the  relay groups on streets and villages, playing wind instruments,  waving bunches of flowers and scattering confetti.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Fledgling Apec begins to take wary steps towards consensus Finance ministers from the 18 countries of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum so enjoyed their first ever meeting in Hawaii that they agreed to gather again next year in Indonesia. That might not seem a large achievement after a day and a half of talks, but it represents a significant step forward for the fledgling Apec, many of whose members remain wary of putting sinew into their informal links. 'The general view is certainly not to institutionalise this meeting but, if we have any specific and substantive issues to discuss, we should do so,' said Mr Anwar bin Ibrahim, deputy prime minister and finance minister of Malaysia, Apec's most reluctant member. Mr Anwar added that there was no commitment to further meetings beyond 1995. Even so, the weekend talks at a beachfront hotel on the outskirts of Honolulu yielded an ambitious programme of work on regional capital flows, infrastructure financing and banking supervision. Ministers also agreed to send their deputies and central bank officials to a further meeting at the end of this year to discuss macroeconomic issues. In a joint statement at the end of the meeting, they agreed on the need for: sustained low-inflation growth. increasing cross-border flows of goods, services and investment. reliance on the private sector as the main engine of growth. further development of capital markets in the region. improved financing mechanisms for the estimated Dollars 1,000bn (Pounds 669bn) of infrastructure projects the region may need over the next decade. Mellowed into conviviality by the bright yellow trousers and pink plaid shirt of their host, Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US treasury secretary, the other Apec ministers deliberately avoided almost all points of bilateral friction, as well as any temptation to force concrete commitments from the discussion. 'This meeting was about co-operation, consultation, consensus. There are more Cs this meeting was not about, like coercion, co-ordination and, I would add, coalition-building,' said Mr Lawrence Summers, US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs. If Apec is to develop towards the 'new Pacific community', sought by President Bill Clinton at a meeting of the region's leaders in Seattle last year, it may be forced to confront some of these points of friction. These include immediate rows, such as the US-Japan trade dispute, US pressure on several south-east Asian countries to open their financial service markets, and its impending clash with China over human rights and the renewal of China's most-favoured nation trading privileges. They also include the possible tension between the broader Apec grouping, encompassing countries on both sides of the Pacific, and narrower groups such as the Association of South-East Asian Nations in the east and the North American Free Trade Agreement in the western hemisphere. Mr Eduardo Aninat, Chilean finance minister, who took part in the meeting although his country will not formally join Apec until the second half of the year, and whose government wishes to become the next member of Nafta, argued that this tension can be overcome, 'as long as both organisations do not represent closed blocs, closed regionalism.' Some of the problems that might arise, however, could be made Apec business, such as energy supply problems in the region, the possible burst of China's bubble economy, and the potential for damaging corporate bankruptcies in the fast-growing stock markets of the region. 'If you are in farming and you have a flood, you don't just lose your crop, you lose your neighbour's crop with it. What happens in one of these countries spills over into the rest,' Mr Bentsen said. 'What we are talking about is the creation of infrastructure in yet another area - financial policy infrastructure,' said Professor David McClain of the University of Hawaii. Mr Paul Martin, finance minister of Canada, cautioned against rushing Apec's evolution: 'What is very clear is people want to see Apec develop under its own steam, not be directed. Apec is an agglomeration of countries; it has to develop at its own pace.' The greatest threat, some observers feel, could come from the US eagerness to press ahead. Apec will require 'a degree of patience that may tax the American mentality, and a degree of sensitivity and cultural awareness in a region where, it seems to me, we have often underestimated the importance of nationalism,' warned Mr Michel Oksenberg, president of the East-West Center, a government-funded research institute based in Hawaii.</p>

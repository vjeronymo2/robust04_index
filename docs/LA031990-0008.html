			<p><P> March 19, 1990, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FBI BANK FRAUD PROBE CENTERS ON EX-OFFICIAL;  </P> <P> EMPIRE: OLEN B. PHILLIPS -- AIRLINE PILOT, CHURCH OFFICIAL AND PHILANTHROPIST  -- IS ALSO UNDER INVESTIGATION BY VENTURA COUNTY AND STATE AUTHORITIES.  </P> <P> Olen B. Phillips, the son of a Texas sharecropper, built a multimillion-dollar  real estate empire in Los Angeles and Ventura counties that paralleled the  growth of the Ventura Freeway corridor in the last two decades.  </P> <P> An airline captain, a bank director, a church official and a philanthropist,  Phillips rose steadily to power as both a businessman and a civic leader in the  Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village areas.  </P> <P> But today, Phillips -- described by his minister as a genius and "one of the  finest men I've ever known" -- faces widespread allegations of fraud and  investigations by county, state and federal officials.  </P> <P> In addition to his real estate business, Phillips was a stockholder and one of  the directors of the now-defunct United Community Bank of Thousand Oaks, the  parent company of Westlake Thrift &amp; Loan of Westlake Village, which went  out of business in 1988.  </P> <P> The Times has learned that the FBI, which already has spent almost two years  probing the involvement of Westlake Thrift in a massive phony loan scheme, is  now investigating Phillips for possible bank fraud in connection with United  Community Bank's role in Westlake's troubles. Phillips was also on the board of  directors of Westlake Thrift.  </P> <P> The FBI will not confirm or deny an investigation of Phillips. Already  convicted in a probe of Westlake Thrift is its former president, Steven Smith  of Thousand Oaks, who last December pleaded guilty in federal court in Los  Angeles to charges of conspiracy, fraud and misapplication of bank funds.  </P> <P> On another front, however, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department says it is  investigating the 50-year-old pilot, who lives in Westlake Village, on  allegations that he defrauded investors in real-estate holdings he controlled.  Many of the complaints under investigation were made by those who purchased  "trust deeds," or gave Phillips cash loans in exchange for claims on property.  </P> <P> County investigators are attempting to trace what happened to "at least $30  million" in missing funds, according to Sheriff's Sgt. Pat Buckley. In many  cases, Buckley said, the missing money represents the life savings of investors  who knew Phillips personally and trusted him, or who had heard of his seemingly  impeccable reputation.  </P> <P> "This will probably be the largest fraud in this county's history," said  Buckley, who estimated that as many as 2,000 investor-victims throughout  Southern California may be involved.  </P> <P> In addition to those investigations, the California Banking Department recently  concluded its own investigation of United Community Bank, which the state  closed last December for lack of funds. That report has been forwarded to the  Ventura County district attorney's office, officials said.  </P> <P> State banking officials suspended Phillips from his duties at the bank and  barred him from its premises in November. The bank's former chairman, Phil  Chase, was also suspended by the state. The Times has learned that Chase is  also under investigation by the FBI for possible bank fraud.  </P> <P> Since his troubles began to mount, Phillips has avoided comment on the growing  furor. On the advice of his attorneys, Phillips declined to speak with The  Times. His attorneys also declined to comment, noting that no charges have been  filed.  </P> <P> Interviews with Phillips' friends and associates, and court records, however,  provide a portrait of an ambitious juggling act that led to success as well as  trouble.  </P> <P> According to those interviewed, Phillips would fly for United Airlines, then  return home to Westlake Village and his Agoura Hills-based company, Phillips  Financial Group, to oversee dozens of limited partnerships and their plans to  turn raw land into offices, homes and profits.  </P> <P> Even those who are critical of Phillips today admired his ability to win  investors' trust with an affable "country boy" style.  </P> <P> "People were falling all over themselves to give him money," said one former  client and employee, and others said that Phillips' job as an airline pilot  enhanced his image as a stable, responsible businessman deserving of  confidence.  </P> <P> "He's very soft-spoken," said another client. "Has a nice family, is a member  of the Baptist church, a pillar of the community -- certainly the type you  would trust."  </P> <P> Phillips settled in the Conejo Valley in 1966, according to published accounts,  and obtained his real estate license while a rookie pilot on stand-by  schedules. He worked for a broker between flights and, in 1969, started his own  business, Westoaks Realty, with fellow real estate agent Richard Principe.  </P> <P> As the business grew into a top area firm, so did Phillips' prominence in the  community, where most people called him "O.B." He was active in the Rotary  Club, several sources said, and gave generously of his time and money to a  variety of local charities. With his three children and wife, Caroline -- his  high school sweetheart -- he attended church regularly, lending his expertise  to First Baptist's building and finance committees.  </P> <P> Phillips was twice elected president of his denomination's statewide  organization, the California Baptist Foundation, and he is a benefactor of  California Baptist College in Riverside, according to the Rev. Ron Wilson,  pastor of First Baptist Church of Thousand Oaks.  </P> <P> "You're talking about an upstanding citizen," said Wilson, who called Phillips  "one of the finest men I've ever known."  </P> <P> Wilson and others described Phillips as a workaholic who lived well but not  ostentatiously. He seemed to derive his pleasure from his family, from flying  and from occasional trips up the coast in a recreational vehicle. A son of  Texas sharecroppers, trained to fly in the military, Phillips never put on  fancy airs and was equally considerate of men rich and poor, Wilson said.  </P> <P> In 1986, Phillips and Principe ended their partnership amicably to run their  own companies. The assets of Westoaks Realty were divided, and Phillips started  the Phillips Financial Group.  </P> <P> Observers marveled at how quickly Phillips re-established himself, setting up  not just one firm to oversee a series of investment syndications but seven  other companies to handle virtually every aspect of real estate development.  Under the umbrella of the Phillips Financial Group, Phillips operated Boardwalk  Escrow, HomesWest Realty, Phillips Property Management and Westlake Mortgage  Inc., among other companies.  </P> <P> All the while, Phillips was flying wide-bodied jets for United, was serving on  the board of United Community Bank and was active in his religious and civic  concerns.  </P> <P> "I think the man's a genius," Wilson said. "To be able to do all the things  he's done over the years, a normal person couldn't do that."  </P> <P> But, looking back at Phillips' business -- the headquarters of which, at 30101  Agoura Court, was raided by sheriff's deputies Dec. 15 -- former clients and  employees now say the "financial group" was poorly run in Phillips' absence.  </P> <P> Lavish monthly breakfast meetings, which Phillips would lead with a prayer and  a motivational speech, could not mask his apparent lack of involvement in  day-to-day operations, said former employees. Nor could the daily inspirational  sayings left on their desks quell fears that few if any of his companies were  turning a profit.  </P> <P> "You were lucky if you got to talk to him, and then you got the impression he  wasn't up on anything," one real estate agent said.  </P> <P> That source and others said there was pressure to "cross-patronize" related  subsidiaries -- urging condominium buyers to use Boardwalk Escrow and Westlake  Mortgage, for example, or referring commercial tenants to Phillips Property  Management. They also said there was pressure to recruit investors, either as  limited partners or trust deed buyers.  </P> <P> Those who gave Phillips money include fellow airline pilots, physicians,  retirees, schoolteachers and Phillips' own church. As word of his troubles have  spread, so have tales of financial ruin.  </P> <P> One Los Angeles policeman, a 38-year-old father of five, claims he may have  lost $475,000 that was to have built his family a new home. The police officer,  who asked not to be named, said he invested in four trust deeds last August,  after the sale of his old house, because he was lured by promises of high  returns.  </P> <P> "My money will never go into anything but a bank," the officer promised himself  recently, then added, "But I may never be in a situation to do that again  either.  </P> <P> "In terms of building another house and providing my family with some of the  dreams I had, those are non-existent now until I get some money."  </P> <P> Many of the allegations now surfacing against Phillips were foreshadowed in a  Superior Court lawsuit filed by Principe last April, eight months before it was  known that Phillips was under criminal investigation.  </P> <P> Principe, who remained a general partner with Phillips in several investment  groups, claims in his suit that Phillips commingled funds among limited  partnerships, failed to record trust deeds he issued to secure loans, borrowed  money on behalf of partnerships without authorization and drove many into debt.  </P> <P> Principe also claims that Phillips was evasive when asked questions and refused  to provide full access to financial records -- the type of behavior that  prompted other investors to contact the Sheriff's Department last summer and  fall, according to Buckley and investors. Late interest payments and bounced  checks also triggered complaints, they said.  </P> <P> Principe's suit claims that, in one example of Phillips' alleged mismanagement,  184 trust deeds totaling more than $3.4 million were not recorded with Ventura  County for months -- and in some cases years -- after they were signed.  </P> <P> As another example of possible mismanagement or fraud, Principe's suit also  cites "unidentified accrued expenses in the amount of $222,257" on one Thousand  Oaks property.  </P> <P> "There are so many holes and discrepancies between the records of the  defendant, the title reports and the records of the plaintiff that it is  virtually impossible to tell with any certainty at this time the financial  condition of the partnerships," Principe claims in court papers filed earlier  this month.  </P> <P> Phillips' attorney, Richard M. Hoefflin of Encino, declined to discuss  Principe's lawsuit or to comment on at least eight others that have been filed  by other investors against Phillips since news broke of the Dec. 15 raid on his  office.  </P> <P> The evidence seized is so vast and so convoluted, Buckley said, that it could  be months before any charges may be filed against Phillips or his company's  officers.  </P> <P> "For many, it was shock, just absolute shock," Steven Rubinstein, executive  director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, said of the raid. "To people  involved in the financial market, some nodded their heads who felt he could  have been overextended on the properties he had, plus his involvement in United  Community Bank."  </P> <P> "I would say over the years he's been responsible for the management of 50 or  60 partnerships," said another area businessman, "and at least 90% of them  closed out and gave returns equal to or better than projected. . . .That's why  this was a surprise to everybody, because he'd done so well for so long."  </P> <P> Phillips still flies for United Airlines, but he returns home to a  significantly scaled-down operation in a smaller office in Thousand Oaks. He  has been voted out of at least two partnerships, according to court records,  and his former headquarters on Agoura Road is the subject of a bankruptcy  proceeding.  </P> <P> He has been flying on a weekend schedule, Wilson said, "so he can spend most of  his time during the week trying to sort out this business."  </P> <P> Several investors said that they have spoken in person with Phillips, and that  he has promised to straighten out a tangle of debts and paralyzed deals and  repay as many people as possible. To that end, he recently retained the Santa  Monica real estate firm of Kibel, Green, which specializes in salvaging  troubled real estate ventures, a company official confirmed.  </P> <P> Wilson, expressing a faith in Phillips that some others have abandoned,  predicted that the pilot will rise again.  </P> <P> "Not only do I think he'll be vindicated," said Wilson, "but, knowing him, I  think he'll rebuild."  </P></p>

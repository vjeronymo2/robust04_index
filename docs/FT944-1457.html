			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Rolls-Royce signs deal to use BMW engines in future models The next generation of Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars will be powered by BMW-supplied engines, and developed in collaboration with the German car maker, under an agreement signed yesterday. The deal between Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury cars subsidiary of UK engineering group Vickers, and BMW, which bought Rover Group from British Aerospace in January, followed nearly a year of negotiations. Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, described it as 'an extremely significant stage for the group in mapping the medium- and long-term future for Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, and in the continuing process of stabilising and positioning all the group's businesses for future growth'. BMW is to supply V12 and V8 engines, which will be further developed with Rolls's Crewe engineers and Vickers' Cosworth Engineering subsidiary to make them more suitable for use in the British company's cars. The supply of other components, including gearboxes, is under consideration. The two companies will also explore ways of developing and bringing to market 'Concept Java', a small coupe prototype. It has just completed a 'world tour' of motor shows and received favourable reviews. Sir Colin stressed Rolls-Royce was not for sale, nor would any equity stake be offered in it 'for the forseeable future'. The agreement relieves Rolls-Royce of the burden of developing its own engines  - an increasingly complex and costly exercise given stringent emission and fuel economy standards. The deal with BMW was reached only after Rolls-Royce had conducted parallel negotiations with Mercedes-Benz. Sir Colin said Vickers had made maximum use of the rivalry between the two German groups. The agreement would not mean job losses at the Crewe plant, said Mr Peter Ward, Rolls-Royce's chairman. Nor would BMW's name appear anywhere on the UK company's cars. The deal comes as Rolls-Royce's sales are slowly improving after one of the steepest falls on record. This year it expects to sell about 1,400 cars, and some analysts predict profits for this year of up to Pounds 12m. Rolls-Royce keeps hold of steering wheel, Page 8 See Lex</p>

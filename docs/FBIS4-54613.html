			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, May 3 (CTK) -- The editorial staff of  the Bratislava evening paper VECERNIK are apologizing to  ex-Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar and the former director of his  secretariat, Anna Nagyova, for publishing on April 26 an article  headlined "Will Vladko Be Rocking the Cradle?", the daily  REPUBLIKA writes today.    Last week VECERNIK wrote that "the love, kept secret for  several years, between Vladko (diminutive for Vladimir) and his  right hand Anicka (diminutive for Anna) who until very recently  were calling the shots in the political heavens is to bear  well-deserved fruit for the benefit of our country in five or  six months."    "It is true that we have published something in small  italics, written in a considerably ironical manner, and  headlined Will Vladko Be Rocking the Cradle?, on April 26,  without mentioning specific," but making it possible to guess  that it concerned the above mentioned figures, VECERNIK  confessed.    The paper called on the Austrian Press Agency APA to publish  a denial of its report, in which it cited the full names of  former Slovak ex-Prime Minister and director of his secretariat,  referring to the VECERNIK story. A spokesman of Meciar's  Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said that "Austria was  interfering with the election campaign in Slovakia in the  dirtiest possible way."</p>

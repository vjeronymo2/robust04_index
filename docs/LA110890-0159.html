			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FINALLY -- ORDER IN THE COURT;  </P> <P> JUSTICE: ON TUESDAY, THE TRAFFIC AND SMALL CLAIMS DIVISIONS OF WEST L.A.  MUNICIPAL COURT WILL LEAVE BEHIND THEIR SHABBY QUARTERS AND MOVE INTO A NEW  BUILDING.  </P> <P> Judges in Division 97A hear their traffic cases in the back room of an old shoe  store. A sign on the second floor says: "All Sales Final! No Refunds."  </P> <P> Next door on Santa Monica Boulevard, outside a former pharmacy, defendants wait  on the sidewalk for their moment of justice. "DO NOT Knock," warns a crudely  lettered cardboard sign. "If you are late you will not be seen today. NO  EXCEPTIONS!!!!" The last two words are underlined in pink nail polish for  greater effect.  </P> <P> Criminal misdemeanor cases are held in temporary trailers.  </P> <P> The decrepit annexes of the West Los Angeles Municipal Court are hardly a  showplace of American jurisprudence.  </P> <P> "It's extremely crowded, ramshackle, tumble-down," said Presiding Judge Richard  G. Berry.  </P> <P> But a change is on the horizon. When the West Los Angeles traffic and small  claims courts open for business Tuesday, it will not be at their current shabby  locations, but in a new office building at 3000 S. Robertson Blvd.  </P> <P> "These will be regular, nice courtrooms," said Robert Quist, Los Angeles  County's deputy court administrator for branch operations. "We've been quite  embarrassed about the facilities we've forced our customers to come into."  </P> <P> The move is also expected to relieve a chronic parking shortage at the West Los  Angeles Civic Center, where only 30 public spaces are now available.  </P> <P> "When we open on Robertson, over 50% of the workload will leave the West L.A.  courthouse, so we expect tremendous improvement," Quist said.  </P> <P> At the new location, people will be able to pay traffic tickets, sign up for  traffic school, schedule hearings and argue traffic cases before a court  commissioner or judge pro tem. Small-claims filings and hearings will also be  heard.  </P> <P> With the growth of population on the Westside in recent years, there has been a  steady increase in business at the West Los Angeles Municipal Courthouse, which  handles about 120,000 traffic cases a year, along with 8,000 small-claims  cases.  </P> <P> "From the time I first came here up to now, (the workload has) at least  doubled," said Berry, who has been there for six years.  </P> <P> The courthouse, designed for four judges, houses 11 jurists in its main  building and its temporary annexes.  </P> <P> The area covered by the court includes all of the city of Los Angeles west of  La Cienega Boulevard, south of Mulholland Boulevard and north of Los Angeles  International Airport.  </P> <P> The temporary trailers and old shops on Santa Monica Boulevard will make way  for a parking lot, Quist said.  </P> <P> The trailers are slated for removal early next year, when 5,000 square feet of  space will be leased for three courtrooms in a city-owned office building  nearby.  </P> <P> By 1995, plans call for a new building to be built at the West Los Angeles  site, plus another courthouse at 111th Street and Aviation Boulevard in the  airport area, which will take on some of the workload now being handled at  Purdue Avenue.  </P> <P> Debbie Crawford, an aide to County Supervisor Deane Dana, said the two new  courthouses are expected to include eight to 10 courtrooms at the Purdue site  and 12 to 18 courtrooms on Aviation Boulevard.  </P> <P> "When both are finished, there should be a net decrease of caseload at Purdue,"  said Jon M. Mayeda, chief presiding judge of the Los Angeles Municipal Courts.  </P> <P> While the cost of the new buildings has yet to be determined, Quist said that  the Robertson site will cost just under $1 million for renovations and a  five-year lease.  </P> <P> "None of this is tax money," he said. "It's all fees that people pay when they  pay traffic and parking fines and bails."  </P></p>

This happened in 1962  when China had attacked us at our northern border. The same  thing happened in 1965 when we went to war with Pakistan. This  happened again in 1971 when we took action against the armed  invasion of Pakistan in order to free Bangladesh. In 1971, the  whole nation had united against the U.S. "gunboat diplomacy"  used in support of the Pakistani army. It should be known that  the U.S. battleship Enterprise was exercising in the Bay of  Bengal. Its purpose was to scare the Indian people, however, it  failed in doing so. The only thing it succeeded in was making  every section of Indian population angry.    Our five decades experience has made it clear how the people  of this country meet any outside challenge or policy to  intimidate and exploit us. The people will not bow to this, but  will protect the pride and autonomy of their country.    The latest expression of this unique response is the  nationwide Indian reaction to the conspiracies hatched in  Washington supported by the leaders of Pakistan. The truth is  that Pakistani noises made over Kashmir would not have affected  us unless everyone from President Clinton down to low-level U.S.  officials had not openly encouraged it to spew poison against  the Indian stand. The anger that was created by the United  States is not limited to its accusation of human rights  violations by Indian troops. It includes its challenge to the  truth about Kashmir's joining India and putting a question mark  on it. The fact is that President Clinton and his assistants  have declared the Kashmir issue as serious as the problems  created by the civil war in Afghanistan. The Clinton government  is openly encouraging Pakistani military officers and armed  terrorists to encourage insurgency against the Indian government.    However, its effect is totally opposite to what was  expected.  How did this happen? This has created a solidarity and unity  within the framework of Indian politics as was not seen since  1971. This national unity resulting from the foreign plot  against India was demonstrated in the leadership of the  government delegation to the UN Human Rights Commission meeting  in Geneva and the Kashmir-related resolution introduced in the  Parliament. There could not be a better display of a united  national stand against the detestable conspiracy to separate  Kashmir from the Indian Union.    This conclusion shows us the actual elements of the American  policy in this region. The government policy-makers appeared to  be working under the belief that after the fall of the Soviet  Union and the end of the Cold War, Washington would think it  necessary to consider India as a more dependable and stable unit  compared to Pakistan in South Asia. At the same time, it was  hypothesized that the disintegration of the Soviet Union would  reduce Pakistan's importance in the American strategy for this  region, because the United States would not need Pakistan as a  military base in the changed international situation.    However, the emergence of facts proved both these notions to  be wrong. The first reason for this is that despite economic  liberalization, India is refusing to become a U.S. tributary or  a supporter nation. The United States cannot consider India as a  safe bet as long as this continues. The second reason is that  the importance of Pakistan has not diminished in the Pentagon.  The main basis for this is the possibility of expanding trade  with the Central Asian countries, nearness to Pakistan, Kashmir,  Tibet, and Sikiang which can be used for annoying China.    Against this background, anyone can realize how useless the  Indian government's request to the U.S. Government to declare  Pakistan a terrorist nation is. In contrast, the India  deputation's criticism of the terrorism introduced from across  the border at the Geneva meeting was very appropriate. It is  equally important for the Indian officials to foil any third  party's efforts to mediate in Kashmir because the United States  would be behind it.    Keeping external interference out of Kashmir is one thing  and  dealing with this issue seriously as an internal problem is  another; these two cannot be mixed up. We have been right in  telling the rest of the world that unrest and tension in Kashmir  is our internal issue. However, we also have to keep the fact in  mind that we cannot resolve this issue just by saying that the  whole problem was created by Pakistan. If we are honest with  ourselves then we should not hesitate in admitting that our  wrong approach in resolving this issue and the mistake of mixing  up the political aspects with administrative aspects have  created a feeling of alienation in the hearts and minds of the  people in the valley. The truth is that the superficial and  cheap strategy being used in the valley is an embarrassing  situation for the Indian democracy. We still have the time to  admit that the real key to solving Kashmir's problem is in the  hands of this nation's government and the political parties. In  order to find a permanent solution to this problem, they should  take the effective and serious initiative of starting talks with  the terrorist groups and their supporters in the Huriat  Conference.  *</p>

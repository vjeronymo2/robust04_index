			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BIDEN CALLS FOR QUIZZING SOUTER ON RIGHTS, ABORTION, RELIGION  </P> <P> Supreme Court nominee David H. Souter will be grilled with "specific questions"  about his views on abortion, civil rights and religion during his confirmation  hearings, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) said  Tuesday.  </P> <P> "At this fateful moment in our history, we have a right to know -- and a duty  to discover -- precisely what David Hackett Souter thinks about the great  constitutional questions of our time," Biden said in a speech to the Senate.  </P> <P> Souter's record offers "more blank spaces than answers," yet his appointment  could result in a profound change in the legal treatment of abortion and  privacy, Biden said.  </P> <P> "In such cases, detailed and thorough questioning is the only way that the  Senate's consent to a nomination can be deemed 'informed consent,' " he said.  </P> <P> Biden's speech, coming two days before Souter's confirmation hearings begin on  Thursday, sought to justify going much further than before in interrogating  high court nominees.  </P> <P> In 1987, during the battle over the nomination of Judge Robert H. Bork, the  Senate debated whether a nominee's philosophy, as opposed to his experience and  intellect, was a valid basis for evaluating his suitability for a seat on the  court. Democrats settled that debate by voting down Bork because of his  conservative ideology.  </P> <P> Now, with the Souter nomination, the key issue is whether the Senate can force  a nominee to reveal his philosophy in order to be confirmed.  </P> <P> "The burden of proof is on the nominee, as it is on us, when we seek election  as senators," Biden said.  </P> <P> "A nominee (to the Supreme Court) must persuade the Senate that he or she is  the person in whose hands we should agree to vest awesome power and  responsibility," Biden said.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Planned Parenthood Federation released a poll of 1,000 voters  suggesting that most Americans agree with Biden's approach.  </P> <P> By a 76%-20% margin, those surveyed said it would be "appropriate for the  Senate to question a Supreme Court nominee on his personal views on privacy,  separation of church and state, abortion and civil rights."  </P> <P> The National Organization for Women became the first group to officially oppose  Souter. "Souter seeks the 'original intent' of the framers of the 18th Century,  a time when all blacks were slaves and women were the property of husbands,"  NOW President Molly Yard said.  </P></p>

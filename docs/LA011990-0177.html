			<p><P> January 19, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P. M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> SWEDISH ARMS FIRM CUTS BACK  </P> <P> AB Bofors, Sweden's biggest weapons producer, said today it will cut its work  force by 500 employees because of falling orders from the Swedish military.  </P> <P> The decision follows a reduction last October by 1,300 workers.  </P> <P> Bofors had counted on continued orders from India, but they were suspended amid  allegations that Bofors paid bribes to secure a $1.3-billion artillery sale in  1986.  </P> <P> In all, the number of Bofors employees will be cut to about 3,000.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Borje Johanson said Bofors had hoped Sweden's military would  place about $200 million in orders, but "we have heard nothing."  </P> <P> Johanson said Bofors' problems are linked to the military's dwindling funds for  new armaments and to politicians' reluctance to allocate more money at a time  of international detente.  </P></p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / National Party changes how New Zealand works / A look at the most radical reform of labour law achieved in any industrialised country NOT MUCH has gone right for New Zealand's conservative National Party government since it swept to a landslide election victory over the former Labour government 15 months ago. The economy remains in recession, unemployment has reached 10 per cent and National support has dropped to below 30 per cent in the opinion polls. However, the government is congratulating itself on the implementation of one of the most radical reforms of industrial relations law achieved in any industrialised country. The Employment Contracts Act (ECA), which became law in May last year, swept away a century of state regulation of the labour market in favour of a de-regulated system which in effect by-passes trade unions. Under the old system, which dated from 1894, most wages and conditions were set centrally in negotiations between unions and employers' representatives and were then legally ratified as occupational 'awards'. The awards covered all workers in each trade, most of whom were also legally required to be union members. The effect was that bargaining was difficult at company level and almost impossible at plant level. The ECA scraps compulsory union membership and national awards in favour of single contracts between employers and individuals or groups of workers, which are enforceable under civil law. Employees can negotiate their own contracts or appoint bargaining agents who may or may not be trade unions. Strikes are legal only during contract negotiations but the act sets minimum entitlements for wages, holidays and sickness benefits. Eight months since the act came into force, it is clear that New Zealand is experiencing a significant shift to productivity bargaining at plant level, combined with a big fall in the number of industrial disputes. What is more surprising, real wages do not appear to have fallen although reductions in shift premiums and the abolition of penalty payments for evening and weekend work have cut unit labour costs by an estimated 20-25 per cent. Mr Bill Birch, employment minister, says the first 90 contracts registered with the government show that only 6 per cent of the employees involved received cuts in nominal wages. The rest received nominal increases of 0-3 per cent, against a background of 1 per cent inflation. That compares favourably with the previous five years during which most workers have suffered falls in real income. The number of working days lost in disputes fell to 1,404 in the first four months after the act became law, compared with 220,950 in the comparable period of the previous year. Most observers agree that the reduction was caused by a combination of recession, legal restrictions on strikes and faster resolution of disputes at plant level, where managers and workers can now discuss problems face to face. The ECA is strongly opposed by the trade union movement, which has lost about 20 per cent of its private sector membership but has been unable to mount any significant industrial action. The unions have been excluded from the bargaining process in about half the contracts signed so far, many of which were negotiated by an emerging industry of employment consultants - mostly lawyers and former union officials. Mr Ken Douglas, president of the Council of Trade Unions, describes the act as the 'Pol Pot-isation' of industrial relations and accuses the government of trying to re-create Victorian exploitation. 'The act is an attempt to use the pressures of unemployment to pull down labour costs. But it is inequitable because it will hurt the weakest most and it will not work because the supposed productivity gains are illusory,' he says. 'They will disappear if the economy ever starts growing again because employers will be unable to resist wage pressures without the co-operation of the union movement. When that happens, the employers will be crying out for a return to collective bargaining.' Mr Mike Moore, the Labour leader, says the act has weakened social justice by removing the unions 'from the factory floor to the car park.' Labour says it will seek an economic agreement with the unions if it wins the next election, due in 1993. On the employers' side, the ECA has been strongly welcomed by the Business Round Table, a free market think-tank which provided much of the intellectual justification for the act. 'The whole thing has been a real good-news story. All the huffing and puffing was over in 24 hours and there has been a surprisingly quick move towards individual contracts with very little industrial disruption,' says Mr Roger Kerr, the Round Table director. However, the act is viewed more cautiously by some employers, many of whom were not prepared for the problems of negotiating directly with their employees. 'It has been a nuisance that management time has had to be spent on the issue,' says Mr Jon Hamilton, chairman of CWF Hamilton, a Christchurch engineering company. 'Some employers have been using the Act to screw down wages but we don't want to do that unless we are driven to it.' New Zealand recorded a 1.3 per cent rise in real gross domestic product in the three months to last September, spurring hopes that the protracted and deep seated recession may have reached a turning point, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. The rise, the first since December 1989, appears to confirm statements from manufacturers that exports are picking up, and follow other encouraging statistics including a fall on annual inflation to 1 per cent, improving overseas trade figures, and surveys showing rising business confidence. However, a Statistics Department spokesman said that the rise was not enough to offset declines in real GDP during the previous three quarters and the index was down 2.4 per cent over the year to September.</p>

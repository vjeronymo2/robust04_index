The feat by Erling Kagge and  Boerge Ousland was questioned by a fellow explorer, Briton Ranulph Fiennes, who  said the two were disqualified when an aircraft picked up a third member of  their expedition, Geir Randby. Kagge denied that they received assistance when  the aircraft rescued Randby, who injured his back in a fall.  </P></p>

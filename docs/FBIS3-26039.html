Statistics show that the number of self-employed households  has now reached 1.12 million, up by 28 percent, and private  enterprises are up to 12,000, a 113 percent rise over 1992.    The rapid growth in the private economic sector is a result  of favorable policies adopted by the Jiangsu provincial  government.    Jiangsu dropped restrictions on the business scope for the  development of private economy and took measures to encourage  private enterprises and self-employed households to expand their  business in technology-oriented and export-oriented services.    The Jiangsu Provincial Administration of Industry and  Commerce also arranged for managers of private enterprises to go  abroad to broaden their entrepreneurial vision.    The economic strength of private enterprises also increased  last year. Of the 6,795 newly-established private enterprises,  there are 174 households whose registered funds exceed 1 million  yuan each.    The self-employed households and private enterprises turned  over taxes of 2.7 billion yuan to the state in 1993, accounting  for 11.6 percent of the total commercial and industrial tax  payment in Jiangsu.    Last year, 86 private enterprises in Jiangsu set up joint  ventures with overseas counterparts, an increase of over 100  percent over 1992.    The export value of the private enterprises in the province  was 71.46 million yuan.</p>

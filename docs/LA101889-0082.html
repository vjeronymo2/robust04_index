			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOV. O'NEILL NO LONGER A PRO-CHOICE TARGET  </P> <P> A national abortion rights group Tuesday removed Connecticut Gov. William A.  O'Neill from a list of top political targets, reversing a stand the group took  just three days earlier.  </P> <P> The reversal by the National Abortion Rights Action League took O'Neill off a  list that includes Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and six  other elected officials as political targets because of their anti-abortion  views.  </P> <P> "I have spoken with Gov. O'Neill's office and I have received assurances that  the governor is not planning any anti-choice initiatives," NARAL leader Kate  Michelman said.  </P> <P> "The governor has stated that regardless of his own personal views he believes  individuals have a right to make their own decisions. As a result, NARAL is  removing him from its list of elected officials targeted for defeat in 1990."  </P> <P> O'Neill said he did not know how he got on the list in the first place, "but  how I got off there became self-evident because the local people in the state  of Connecticut knew I shouldn't have been on there to begin with."  </P> <P> Michelman added that her group will be watching all of the candidates in the  1990 race for Connecticut governor and may "consider involvement" as the  campaign develops. O'Neill, a Democrat, has said he plans to seek reelection.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the National Organization for Women launched a tour this week in  Virginia to encourage women to vote for Democrat Douglas Wilder for governor  because of the anti-abortion views of his Republican opponent.  </P> <P> Wilder, Virginia's lieutenant governor, faces former Atty. Gen. Marshall  Coleman on Nov. 7.  </P></p>

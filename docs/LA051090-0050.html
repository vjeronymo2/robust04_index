			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AT MOUND AND AT PLATE, TWO STANDOUT PREP PLAYERS;  </P> <P> STRONG, SILENT PITCHER FOR ST. ANTHONY LETS HIS ARM AND BAT DO THE TALKING  </P> <P> He is tall and left-handed, which, for a pitcher, can be an imposing  combination to begin with. More importantly, he throws a fastball that moves  wickedly.  </P> <P> Eric Mooney of St. Anthony High School was dispensing with some Pius X High  batters on a recent afternoon at Guesno Field in Lakewood.  </P> <P> Two veteran major league scouts sat behind the backstop and directed their  radar guns at the 6-foot-3, 200-pound Mooney.  </P> <P> "Everything moves," said Jack French of the San Francisco Giants, talking about  Mooney's pitches. "He gets all his shoulder into it. It seems like he's  throwing like a pro already, as far as form goes."  </P> <P> Art Sherman of the Milwaukee Brewers added: "He's potentially a good prospect.  He's strong and he likes to play."  </P> <P> Sherman's gun revealed that Mooney had just thrown a pitch 83 m.p.h., which is  good for a high school pitcher, according to French.  </P> <P> "There's only one guy I've seen this year in high school, junior college or  college who's thrown 90, and that was a pitcher at Long Beach State, (Dennis)  Gray," French said.  </P> <P> Mooney pitches in the highly competitive Camino Real League, which is composed  of Division 2-A schools. But Sherman said he would also fare well against  larger schools.  </P> <P> "He could throw in the Moore League," Sherman said. "There are a lot of JCs and  colleges interested in him."  </P> <P> John Herbold, coach at Cal State Los Angeles, looked over from his spot behind  the screen and said: "What do you think I'm here for?"  </P> <P> Mooney could be selected in the June professional draft, but if he is not, he  said, he may attend St. Mary's College in Moraga. "I'd like to go into pro ball  (eventually)," he said.  </P> <P> He threw a curve ball and a Pius X batter lined it into left field for a hit.  After that he decided to stick with the fastball and he went on to strike out  12 batters in a 9-4 victory.  </P> <P> The 18-year-old senior has a 6-4 record and a 2.12 earned run average. One of  his victories was over No. 1-ranked El Segundo, 4-3. In 65 innings he has  struck out 103 batters and walked 19.  </P> <P> He is the major reason why St. Anthony, 11-8 overall and 10-2 in the league  before Wednesday's rematch with El Segundo, will be in the CIF Southern Section  playoffs for the first time in four years.  </P> <P> Pitching in the little park at Del Amo Boulevard and Clark Avenue is not an  advantage for Mooney. The fences, topped with 20-foot-high nets, are not far  away. It is only 250 feet down the right-field line and less than 300 to the  power alleys.  </P> <P> A .335 hitter and the team's RBI (21) and home run leader (7), Mooney plays  first base when he is not pitching. He homered against Pius X; the ball landed  in a back yard beyond the net in right. But he prefers being on the mound.  </P> <P> "I decided to be a pitcher because at every place else on the field you're not  in on every play," he said.  </P> <P> Mooney lets his arm and bat speak for themselves.  </P> <P> "He's kind of quiet," said Saints Coach Ron Tostenson. "He's a hard worker and  very coachable."  </P> <P> Because St. Anthony does not have a pitching coach, Mooney has to look  elsewhere for help. Last summer he worked with former major league pitcher Vern  Ruhl, now pitching coach at Cal State Fullerton.  </P> <P> "He taught me how to use my legs more," Mooney said.  </P> <P> Mooney averaged 16 points for St. Anthony's JV basketball team last season but  decided this year to concentrate solely on the sport he has played since he was  6 years old.  </P> <P> That dedication has been rewarded.  </P></p>

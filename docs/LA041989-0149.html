			<p><P> April 19, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> PANEL SUPPORTS USE OF FETAL TISSUE  </P> <P> A Stanford University medical ethics committee, following the lead of a  National Institutes of Health panel, said today that aborted human fetuses  should be used in medical research under certain conditions.  </P> <P> The use of fetal tissue from elective abortions has touched off a highly  emotional and controversial debate, and in March the government imposed a  moratorium on the use of federal funds for transplant research using such  tissue.  </P> <P> A government ruling on the issue "will provide an early signal of President  Bush's willingness to let the politics of abortion dictate the course of the  research that is done by government scientists and funded with federal money,"  said researchers George Annas and Sherman Elias, writing in the April 20 New  England Journal of Medicine.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 1990 ORANGE COUNTY;  </P> <P> DEPTH OF COMMITMENT TO BE MEASURED;  </P> <P> AMUSEMENT PARKS  </P> <P> Both Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm will continue in the '90s to tempt  crowds with new attractions and special events -- an old formula, but one that  has worked.  </P> <P> Knott's first salvo in the battle for local tourist dollars -- about half the  visitors at both parks come from Southern California -- will be the Boomerang,  a roller coaster slated to open next summer on the site of the old Corkscrew.  Notoriously tight-lipped Disneyland has yet to leak details of its next major  attraction, although an announcement may come next month.  </P> <P> "There's one thing I can say with certainty: There'll be new things, and we'll  continue to change," said Jack Lindquist, Disneyland's vice president of  creative marketing concepts. Among the possibilities: a ride based on the mine  train chase from the film "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the park will continue its '80s love affair with odd anniversaries  and character birthdays. Next month, Disneyland begins a yearlong celebration  of its 35th anniversary, patterned after its highly successful 30th with car  giveaways, special parades and live entertainment.  </P> <P> While both businesses consider themselves "family" parks, Knott's has developed  a niche separate from its bigger and better-known neighbor, according to Stuart  Zanville, the park's director of public relations. "Knott's is a reality park,"  he says. "Disneyland is a fantasy park." Zanville also characterizes Disneyland  as more ride-oriented, while Knott's will continue to pursue a more "relaxed"  emphasis on shopping, restaurants and live entertainment.  </P> <P> Local tourism should continue strong in the '90s, spokesmen for both parks  agree. Lindquist cites resort development on the Irvine coast, plans for major  sports arenas in Anaheim and Santa Ana and a much-discussed high-speed train  from Anaheim to Las Vegas as potential boosts. Zanville brings up evidence of a  "mini baby-boom" and predictions of more discretionary income and more leisure  time.  </P> <P> "We think it's going to be a good time for the parks," Zanville said.

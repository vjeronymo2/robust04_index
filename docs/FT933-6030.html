			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / International Company News: Linotype plunges into the red SHARES in Linotype-Hell, the German print technology group, tumbled 8 per cent yesterday after an alarming half-year report announced a plunge into loss and a drastic overhaul of the business. The 'unexpected' deficit of DM57m (Dollars 33.7m) following a first-half profit of DM16m last time, had 'cast a shadow over the whole year', the company said. The company's shares dropped DM33 in Frankfurt to close at DM377. Group sales were down 3 per cent to DM471m. Aiming to return to the black by 1994, Linotype plans to cut its international workforce by about 15 per cent, reduce its product range, and reorganise management and production structures. The report hinted at possible domestic capacity closures with a statement that efforts to reduce manufacturing costs would be actively pursued, especially to tackle problems associated with production within Germany. While there had been no sign of problems in the first quarter, the company said, its customers were now complaining of falling advertising revenues and profits. Incoming orders fell 7 per cent, stemming partly from a 17 per cent slump in Germany, although demand in other European markets was down by as much as 50 per cent. Orders from Japan, the third-biggest market after the US and Germany, were down 15 per cent. Announcing job losses of 500 in Germany and 200 abroad, the company said it might not be able to avoid compulsory redundancies.</p>

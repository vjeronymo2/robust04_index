			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Chernomyrdin 'to expose' army graft Russian prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is preparing an all-out attack on corruption in the armed forces, Sevodnya, a leading Moscow daily, reported today. The newspaper alleges that army generals, who are appealing to the government for more funds and warning that the military may be unable to pay soldiers' salaries in the autumn, are siphoning off money from the armed forces' budget. Citing unnamed sources close to Mr Chernomyrdin, Sevodnya claims that the prime minister, who is struggling to resolve Russia's mounting debt crisis without triggering a new round of inflation, plans to expose and oust corrupt senior generals. The newspaper's story, which reporters say was leaked by high-ranking military officials, alleges that generals in the armed forces' Central Budget and Financial Administration are profiting by earning interest from military funds which they claim have been lost in Russia's labyrinthine financial system. The funds are eventually found and returned to the military treasury, but not before serious delays in the payment of the armed forces' bills have occurred. This allegation comes in the wake of government claims last week that the payments' crisis in other sectors of the Russian economy is in part due to corrupt factory directors and suggests that the government is looking for culprits on whom to pin the blame for the debt mountain. The latest controversy comes at a time when the Russian military is already being shaken by another, more public, crisis. Russia's high command is trying to send the outspoken and popular officer, General Alexander Lebed, from his power base in the 14th army in Moldova to command Russian troops in war-torn Tajikistan, on the Afghan border. But General Lebed, who resisted the defense ministry's efforts to remove him from his post and disband the 14th army earlier this month, is proving difficult to unseat. Colonel Mikhail Bergman, a 14th army officer who is the general's closest confidant, said that General Lebed has refused to go to Tajikistan. 'They are trying to push him (General Lebed) away to the periphery,' Colonel Bergman said. 'They are sending him under fire and hoping that maybe he will die.' Colonel Bergman said that if General Lebed were to be removed from his command of the 14th army for rejecting his new orders, 'we officers and soldiers of the 14th army will form partisan brigades'. Together with the corruption allegations, whose high-level military sources suggest an internal effort to undermine General Pavel Grachev, the minister of defence, General Lebed's recalcitrance indicates growing rifts within the ministry which was once the pride of the Soviet Union. General Lebed, whose calls for the imposition of a military dictatorship and scathing denunciation of Russia's government has made him the darling of the officer corps, could become a locus for disaffected soldiers. Colonel Bergman is unstinting in his praise of the young general, whom he describes as 'a second Kutuzov', in a reference to the military leader who brought Russia victory in the Napoleonic wars. Colonel Bergman describes General Lebed as 'twice as strong as Arnold Schwarzenegger with a memory so powerful he need never commit anything to paper'.</p>

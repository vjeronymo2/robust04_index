I. Potapov, R. </F> S. Gildenskiold, and I. L. Vinokur (Moscow); UDC 614:7-07(470)]    [Text]Many years of industrial construction in Russia  without comprehensive scientific work on the set of problems  that determine the optimum impact of use of technologies on the  environment and man have led society to the knowledge of many  facts of the devastating effect on the environment and public  health of economic activities in various industrially developed  regions, now that the press has more freedom.    According to data in an annual dealing with atmospheric  pollution in cities of the Russian Federation, more than 40  cities are named in the list of cities with a high level of air  pollution.    Many hygienic research developments and data of WHO have  shown that there is a distinct correlation between level and  frequency of exposure to pollutants, morbidity and health status  of people residing in such an environment [1-6, 9, 10].    The extent of manifestation of negative consequences of  anthropogenic transformations of the environment is so great  that, at present, there can be no question of simultaneous and  comprehensive solution of the problem of improving and  optimizing the stricken environment. We need to have validated  routes for implementing in stages engineering, economic, social  and medical measures in this direction. Laying scientific and  methodological foundations for special mapping should be  considered as one of the mechanisms for such control of this  process.    Originally, ecological-hygienic mapping, as a system of  reflecting quantitatively and qualitatively the sanitary  situation that has actually developed as a result of  anthropogenic activities in a specific region, was elaborated at  the Novosibirsk affiliate of the Hygiene and Occupational  Pathology Scientific Production Association, with involvement of  specialists in different fields of knowledge of the Siberian  Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences [7], and in  subsequent years it was further developed at the Moscow Research  Institute of Hygiene imeni F. F. Erisman and other research  institutions. The value of such mapping to the national economy,  from the standpoint of environmental and health protection, lies  in the fact (provided information is reliable) that it permits  differentiated presentation of the severity of  ecological-hygienic disturbances in the objects of  investigation, forecasting future development of negative  tendencies, determination with some degree of reliability of the  most dangerous ``hot'' spots of environmental impact, and then  to plan adequate effective measures for immediate and long-term  implementation. Obtaining complete and reliable information is a  difficult aspect of such ``ground-based'' multifactor mapping  (geographic position, aerometeorological distinctions,  concentration of industry, its composition, conditions of  formation of fields of environmental pollution, potential for  atmospheric pollution, self-purification processes, resettling  of workers -- guidelines and their implementation, criteria of  the burdens on the environment, health status and morbidity of  the public, and many others). This applies, first of all, to  quantitative and qualitative assessment of industrial sources of  environmental pollution.    We know that, at the present time, there is far from  accurate  registration or inventorying of industrial enterprises, in the  absence of reliable devices (automated or semi-automated) for  recording the toxic components of waste contained directly in  the smoke plume. Consequently, reliability of forecasting on the  basis of this indicator of technogenic impact is also relative.    On the one hand, the correlation between overall impact of  toxic substances on public health has been established for  marked contrasts and, on the other hand, it does not have an  adequate scientific foundation when exogenous factors are of low  intensity.    Evidently, it is worthwhile to also mention that so-called  mobile sources -- exhaust from various means of transportation  -- present a serious problem with respect to assessing the  multifactor impact. We cannot fail to mention the capabilities  of laboratory monitoring of environmental pollution which are  presently based on methods of chemical assay that are not  accurate or selective enough. High-precision physical monitoring  methods and supply of modern instruments in different  localities, even in hygienic research institutions, are being  adopted too slowly. From the standpoint of enhancing forecast  quality and, accordingly, recommended means of tactical  interaction in a positive direction of development of the  national economy, it is important to accurately assess the  potential for pollution released by the soil and vegetation  accumulated in the course of long-term operation of enterprises,  which usually have obsolete technology, as a result of  desorption by toxic substances, often already transformed in the  environment, from the surface of buildings and installations,  and the probability of their secondary negative impact on all  living things within the limits of artificially created  geochemical territories.    There are grounds to discuss the fact that, with all the  benefit of developing and using modern hygienic mapping, at  present it is deemed desirable to direct efforts, as much as  possible, toward upgrading this important direction of national  economic, sociohygienic and ecological research. Aerial mapping  from outer space, as a large-scale additional element of  ``terrestrial'' mapping, may be viewed as an important one of  these informative procedures that are on the front lines of our  science.    What would we like to gain from the use of this  methodological procedure and what we can expect of it, in view  of the fact that space engineering is, as a rule, considerably  ahead of the capabilities of ``terrestrial measurements'' from  the standpoint of hygiene?    First of all, with the high resolution of the equipment, it  is realistic to expect obtaining precise data on the range of  pollution of a given industrially developed territory as a  result of long-term settling of toxic constituents of discharged  waste on the earth's surface.    Special emphasis should be placed on the fact that the first  joint work with the research center for space ecology indicates  that, as of the present time, the main characteristics of the  technogenic burden on a specific territory, as ``seen'' from  space, are in the form of distinctly circumscribed spots  differing in intensity. Technically, it is possible to obtain  cross-sections of such a spot according to saturation density at  any specified altitude, starting virtually with the earth's  superficial layer.    At present it is extremely important for space engineering  to  enable us to determine the differences in extent of involvement  of the environment of a given part of a city, a region, not only  according to intensity and density of the smoke cloud, but also  according to composition of main and permanent elements of urban  pollution -- sulfur dioxide and nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon  monoxide, heavy metals, etc. The intensity and qualitative  composition of the smoke ``plume'' traveling in the wind  direction would enable us to compare the findings of ground-  based studies (laboratory, forecasts, mathematical) to values  recorded from space, which would have a direct influence on  reliability of data and, of course, help enhance the quality of  work carried out everywhere in the direction of ecology and  hygiene. We believe that, to some extent, such studies will help  define the optimum locations for permanent observation stations  for monitoring actual industrial pollution levels in residential  parts of urban regions. They could have a substantial impact on  development of forecasting of significance of spread of  pollutants, which is used extensively in the form of an  effective method of calculating the scatter of waste in the  atmosphere (OND-86) in industrial construction plans [8].    Determination of pollutants differing in saturation over the  entire potential range of pollution of a region under study,  which is done under ordinary conditions in isolated cases by  very labor-intensive work, for example, metallometric  photography, would make it possible to correctly ``trigger'' the  mechanism for adopting the most effective measures to  ``correct'' the developed adverse situation locally in a given  region.    And there is one more important factor. Because of two-way  definition and refinement of methodological approaches to  terrestrial and space monitoring in order to enhance reliability  of indicators of technogenic pollution of a residential region,  one can expect with confidence that ongoing and dynamic  ground-based monitoring of the sanitary condition of the urban  environment, which is very expensive, could be handed over  entirely (with great informativeness) to space monitoring.    Within the same approach, one could develop an enlarged  scale,comprising the intensity of pollution spot coloration and  concentrations of main and overall pollutants; on the basis of  this scale, objectively validated territories differing in  degree of pollution of the environment, zones of biologically  hazardous existence, etc., could be charted with utmost  reliability on the map of Russia.    In this regard, it is hoped that the representative positive  experience in determining correlations between intensity of  pollution according to darkness of the spot from space and data  on demography and morbidity pertaining thus far only to one  nosological form, involvement of respiratory organs, would make  it possible to formulate and solve on a global scale the problem  of defining the order and urgency of development of protective  steps. It would be desirable to use, along with the data from  space mapping, those obtained from ground-based hygienic  mapping, medical statistics and clinical studies, which would  make it possible to create in cartography a scientific  classification of ecological-hygienic zoning.    Such an approach would have a substantial effect on solving  a  number of problems. It will become possible for the State to  allocate funds in a purposeful way with scientific validation  for environmental protection (at the expense of fines imposed on  enterprises and local budget), first of all in the most  hazardous polluted regions for the purpose of ongoing and rapid  amelioration. As a mandatory prerequisite in plans for  socio-economic development of specific regions, closure of  particularly hazardous industries and plants, and implementation  of radical reconstruction of enterprises with adoption of  modern, progressive waste-free or minimum-waste technologies  within time periods coordinated in each individual case, would  be an objective argument against further build-up of the  industrial potential within a specific, limited polluted  territory. In order to comprehend the sociohygienic situation,  an accurate ``view from the top'' would permit objective  evaluation of biologically possible or impossible further  resettling of workers in a given region as a whole and as  applied to each major urban region. Just as important, and  perhaps even more important, is objective determination of  optimum times, from the standpoint of safeguarding public  health, for implementation of long-term programs, developed with  the participation of hygienists, for improving living  conditions, measures to improve the health of the public in each  specific city, rayon, and region; the established ranges of  migration of technogenic impurities when waste is discharged  through ultratall smokestacks would permit consideration of the  internationally important matter of migration of pollutants  across frontiers from the territory of our State to adjacent  countries. Appropriate mapping of dynamic features of this  process would also permit solving the problem of lowering the  intensity of directional flow and improving the existing  situation.    Of basic importance is the question of correlation between  factors of environmental pollution and health indictors. One can  advance to quantitative forecasting of health indicators,  including morbidity indicators, by establishing, with use of  hygienic monitoring, the quantitative correlation between the  integral sanitary description of the environment and indicators  of health status of different age-sex and social groups --  physical development, functional (including immunological)  deviations, morbidity (most frequently determined according to  frequency of seeking medical attention) and mortality rates.  From the standpoint of hygiene, when monitoring public health it  is important to organize records of premorbid states  (prenosological diagnoses), first of all among the child  population, on the basis of analysis of results of periodic  physicals.    It will be necessary to devote particular attention to  forecasting morbidity related to the negative influence of  environment polluting factors, development and determination of  integral pollution indicators and priority pollutants, detection  of groups, territories and diseases at risk, keeping records of  social, environmental and other factors.    Bearing this in mind, it is imperative to immediately  integrate ground- based information obtained in the course of  ground-based hygienic mapping, which includes not only data on  pollutants, but also on their effect on human health, with the  maps plotted from space of changes in transparency of the  atmosphere, and to develop methods for such integration, which  should conform accurately enough both to the capabilities of  terrestrial and space monitoring, and to the goal of solving the  most pressing problems of protecting the environment and human  health, i.e., we are referring to involvement of health care  agencies in the system of ecological-hygienic ground-based and  space monitoring, on the basis of using modern technology,  knowledge in environmental hygiene and mathematical methods.    Thus, refinement of a reliable enough ground-based and space  method of monitoring and ranking, which would permit not only  ecological hygienic zoning of the country, but also systematic  ongoing information about changing situations in order to  control the quality of the environment on the broadest scale in  the interests of public health, is the principal factor, from  the standpoint of science and practice, in development of this  direction of research.

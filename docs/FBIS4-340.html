			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by P. Bulger] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg April 7 SAPA -- The African Christian  Democratic Party [ACDP] on Thursday [7 April] launched an  election manifesto which, it said, provided a basis for the  social and economic transformation of South Africa.    The programme is based on a moral, judicial and ethical  system, open market economics and direct democracy. The ACDP  said a mere change in centrl government would not answer South  Africa's social needs. "If a new government attempts a mere  lineal approach of more houses, more jobs, more teachers, more  schools and more hospitals, it will bankrupt the country long  before the goal is ever reached. A transformational strategy  through the introduction of a new dimension of freedom is the  only hope," the ACDP manifesto says.    The manifesto was introduced by party leader Kenneth Meshoe,  Chairman Johan van der Westhuizen, spokesman Dan Maluleke and  Policy Co-ordinator Nick Addison.    Dr van der Westhuizen said communities formed the building  blocks of the ACDP's programme. "The ACDP stands for the  centrality of the family as the home for human development and  the cornerstone for building healthy communities and a stable  society," the manifesto says.    "Community-based development organisations and/or community  development trusts should assist local government in the  implementation of the various development and social delivery  functions on a contractual basis. Community involvement in the  allocation and uses of scarce resources will improve  transparency and a more equitable application of these  resources."    Dr van der Westhuizen said the party was committed to  federalism with a two-tier government, the first tier being a  small central government and the second being district  governments. The system's purpose would be to curb the growth  of bureaucracy and to prevent majoritarian tyranny.    The ACDP would create wealth by stimulating entrepreneurship  and small business. It opposed redistribution of wealth and  confiscation of land although it supported land restitution by  legal means. "The ACDP opposes policies which will simply dump  families on unsustainable plots of land, which will trap them  into subsistence and poverty. Land allocation will have to meet  the criterion of viability and will have to be supplemented by  effective support systems to avoid further depletion and erosion  of a scarce resource," the manifesto says.    Under an ACDP government, social services would be provided  by district governments while the state would provide services  within its means. Statutory bodies would be set up to maintain  national standards which would become equitable over a 10-year  period.    Dr van der Westhuizen said the ACDP had 147 offices  countrywide and the support of about 8,000 "community" leaders.  It was formed in December last year to contest the elections  nationally.</p>

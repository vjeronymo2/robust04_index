			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Election and hot weather melt profits at Thorntons AFTER beating off recession, Thorntons, the luxury chocolates seller, has finally fallen foul of Britain's fickle, and apparently unfilial, consumers. The company yesterday issued a profits warning for the year to the end of June, blaming election uncertainty for poor sales between Mothers' Day and Easter. Since then, the hot weather has also played a part, prompting chocolate fiends to spurn their favourite treat for something more refreshing. Mr Alan Goodwin, finance director, said Mothers' Day and Easter account for 25 per cent of annual sales and both were disappointing. Mothers' Day was poorly promoted on the high street, and sons and daughters may have tried to save a pound or two by trading down from Thorntons to pre-packed chocolate boxes. Although the election was over a week before Easter, there was a rush of spending rather than a constant flow. This led to queues in Thorntons' shops, and again prompted consumers to go elsewhere. The City expected Thorntons to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 11.5m and the profit warning led to a 4p fall in the share price to 206p. Rowe and Pitman, the company's stockbroker, yesterday cut its forecast to Pounds 10.4m while Panmure Gordon was going for Pounds 10m. Last year Thorntons made Pounds 11.9m. But it is not all doom and gloom. Thorntons' ice cream products, shipped over from France, doubled turnover last week as Britain baked. Unfortunately ice cream still accounts for only about 5 per cent of annual sales, and even a hot summer will not make up for the melting chocolate market. See Lex</p>

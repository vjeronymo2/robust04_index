			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mortgage lenders warn on further base-rate cuts BUILDING SOCIETIES are unlikely to be able to pass on the full amount of any further cuts in base rates because they have to maintain their rates on savings products, leaders of the mortgage lending industry said yesterday. Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said that because interest on long - term investments was now higher than on short-term savings products, building societies could not lower mortgage rates much further. He told the Treasury and Civil Service committee: 'The extent to which we will be able to reflect further reductions in base rates will be limited.' A reduction of 1 percentage point was 'just not on'. The statement came after a call by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, for building societies to pass on the whole of recent base-rate cuts to lenders. Societies say they have to widen margins in order to compensate for mortgage losses. Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Building Societies Association, said lenders would be wrong to reduce rates and then put them up to restore profitability. The association said in written evidence to the committee that the industry was suffering a net outflow of savings funds this year because of competition from longer term investments. Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds Bank, said the bank's overall margin on domestic lending had fallen over the past 10 years. He said the scope to raise margins was limited by the lack of demand, and market competition. He told MPs it was not bank policy to widen margins and the average difference between the rate charged and the cost of funding loans had narrowed about 0.5 per cent in the past year. The average margin was 2.8 per cent in 1991 compared with about 2.3 per cent around the middle of this year, he said. Mr Pitman denied increasing margins on loans to small businesses to support profits in the recession. He strongly denied claims that bank charges were tipping companies into bankruptcy. 'It's not in our interests to push a company into liquidation,' he said, adding that Lloyds was 'sharing the pain' with its customers. Mr Pitman also said the worst of the recession appeared to have passed and signs of recovery were growing. Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, is inquiring into reports that insider rings of solicitors and estate agents are manipulating the market in repossessed homes. Mr Edward Leigh, junior trade and industry minister, told the Commons yesterday that Sir Bryan would consider taking action against individuals under the 1979 Estate Agents Act. Under the act the director-general may, in certain circumstances, prohibit individuals from engaging further in estate agency work.</p>

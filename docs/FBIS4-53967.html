			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 24 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  said Tuesday the United States is not likely to demand that  Tokyo set numerical targets to measure progress in opening  Japanese markets as means of rectifying the chronic bilateral  trade imbalance.    Hata, answering questions at the House of Representatives  Budget Committee, said Japan and the U.S. have deepened mutual  understanding through a series of recent contacts on the issue.    The premier said vice ministerial-level negotiations in  Washington on resumption of a new bilateral trade framework have  neared conclusion, although he has not received a report on the  results.    Japan cannot accept such numerical targets, Hata said, "and  I  expect it (the outcome of the negotiations) is not likely to  have such things."    Tokyo has rejected a U.S. demand to introduce such targets,  which led to a collapse in February's bilateral summit.    According to Japanese officials, Japan and the United States  late Monday resumed long-stalled talks on a new trade framework  following an agreement that was clinched after four days of  tough negotiations.    They said the results of the agreement will be announced  Tuesday night Japan time, but they did not provide other details.    Hata reiterated that Japan must make efforts to further open  its market on its own initiative, through deregulation and  clarifying procedures to access the market.</p>

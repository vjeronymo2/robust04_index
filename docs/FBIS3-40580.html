			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Discussion and Reconciliation on the Kashmir </F> Issue-Why?"]    [Text] Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto said in an interview  with Iran's English newspaper, THE TEHRAN TIMES, that Pakistan  would welcome Iran's efforts to end Indian atrocities in  occupied Kashmir. THE TEHRAN TIMES informed that Iran is willing  to try reconciliations between Pakistan and India in order to  establish peace in South Asia. The Foreign Ministry  representative, in his weekly report, gave a brief glimpse of  the Indian atrocities in Kashmir. The spokesman said that even  Indian newspapers and news agencies have reported that the  Indian troops during the last few days have increased their  atrocities against the Kashmiri people. During the night of 4  and 5 December, the Indian troops killed 17 Kashmiris, and are  now throwing even old Kashmiri leaders into jails. The Indian  government just cannot justify its troops' bestial atrocities in  Sopur. The fact is that India knows well that it cannot  establish its rule even by allowing its hundreds of thousands of  soldiers to commit atrocities against the people of Jammu and  Kashmir. The Kashmiri people will get rid of the barbarous  Indian occupation whenever they find an opportunity to do so,  and they will succeed in their desire to join Pakistan.  Therefore, in addition to trying to suppress their struggle  through these abominable activities, it is also involved in  their genocide in order to change the balance of the population  so that it can establish its rule there. What is necessary in  this situation is that Pakistan and other Islamic countries  force India to stop its atrocities and give the Kashmiri people  the right to autonomy according to UN resolutions. The Islamic  world, however, is helpless, and Pakistan, without the support  of the Islamic bloc, is not in a position to do anything.    India is aware of this weakness of Pakistan, and it is not  willing to sway from its position of considering Kashmir an  "integral part." Because of its open acts of inhumanity, the  whole world has become concerned, and India's mask of secularism  and peaceful designs have been removed. India stages its fake  desire to hold talks just to fool the world and spoil the  philosophical and ideological unity between Pakistanis and the  Kashmiri people. It also raises slogans of decreasing tension  between the two countries. Recently, when the Hazratbal shrine  was taken over and the Kashmiri people succeeded in focusing the  eyes of the world on the Kashmir issue, we expected that  Pakistan, by presenting a resolution in the United Nations,  would unmask India. There was a good possibility of this  resolution being passed; however, India, through the United  States, gave Pakistan the false hope of holding talks and  stopped it from presenting the resolution. It also agreed to set  aside 1 January for holding talks. However, India neither  stopped the siege around the Hazrat Bal shrine nor did it stop  committing atrocities against the Kashmiri people in order to  establish atmosphere for bilateral talks. It did not decrease  its propaganda against Pakistan, either; instead, it increased  its activities against the Kashmiri people. The bloody incidents  of Sopur also occurred after India's announcement that talks  would be held. According to news reports, the Indian soldiers  have started to drink alcohol in the Hazrat Bal shrine.    In such a situation, the people are not very hopeful, and  the  government will also lose hope for holding peace talks with  India, keeping in mind India's record of backing out of its  promises. The way India increased its atrocities in Kashmir  after this announcement of talks was made, and Pakistan's  decision to not introduce a resolution in the United Nations,  causes us to expect an increase in tension between India and  Pakistan after reconciliatory talks. That is what our experience  tells us. According to some sources, India will also hold talks  to discuss Wooler Barge and Siachen. It is true that Wooler  Barge is situated in occupied Kashmir; however, both these  issues are India's favorites, because a return of soldiers from  Siachen would help reduce negative effects on India's economy.  The construction of Wooler Barge is also beneficial to India.  The talks that were held over Siachen at the secretary level  have not produced anything. India has not followed up on its  promises. We should make it clear that talks should be held over  Kashmir first, and decisions should be made according to the UN  resolution. Later, we can discuss Siachen and Wooler Barge.  Therefore, the government, instead of being mislead, should be  practical. It should not discourage the Kashmiri freedom  fighters and the people by talking about peace discussions. A  deputation of U. S. senators is coming to Pakistan under the  leadership of Larry Pressler on 13 December. On the outside,  they will be here to discuss the Pakistani nuclear program and  the Pressler Amendment, however, the Kashmir issue will also be  on their agenda. The change that occurred in the U.S. policy  after Assistant Secretary of South Asia Robin Raphael's visit to  this region recently calls for us to be on the alert. We hope it  does not turn out that our "friend" pressures us again to make a  decision in support of India. At present, in addition to India  and the United States, our Foreign Ministry and the foreign  minister are also "remembering" the Simla agreement. India's  definition of the Simla agreement is not acceptable to Pakistan  at all. Recently, by not introducing a resolution in the United  Nations, we accepted the Indian definition. This means that the  Kashmir issue cannot be raised in an international forum. We  hope it does not happen that they make us sign some sort of  Kashmir agreement at Camp David. By trusting our "friends," who  have always been untrustworthy, we will lose again. Our friendly  relations with Iran are above any suspicion. Iran's stand on the  Kashmir issue is also very encouraging, but any talks about  arbitration between the atrocious nation and the victim, and  tyrants and the oppressed, are beyond our understanding.  Therefore, our government, policy makers, and the bureaucrats in  the Foreign Ministry should, instead of discussing any formulas  for arbitration, increase their pressure for imposing economic  restrictions against India and to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir.  We should get the support of world opinion and awaken our  Islamic brotherhood. We shall benefit from this, and that is our  duty.</p>

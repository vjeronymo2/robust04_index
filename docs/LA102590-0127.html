			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONFEREES OK INCREASE OF 45% IN IMMIGRATION  </P> <P> Congressional negotiators agreed Wednesday to a major restructuring of national  immigration policies, permitting at least 45% more foreigners to enter the  country in each of the next three years and about 35% more in every year  thereafter.  </P> <P> Under terms of the deal, struck by a House-Senate conference committee, 700,000  persons would be allowed to immigrate to this country each year from 1992 to  1994, up from the current 500,000. In subsequent years, the United States would  admit 675,000 immigrants. Neither figure includes refugees.  </P> <P> The legislation would open the nation's doors wider to Europeans, some Africans  and other foreigners who have been virtually locked out of legal immigration by  existing U.S. policy that gives preference to reuniting the families of current  U.S. citizens.  </P> <P> Present immigration law, enacted 25 years ago, emphasized family reunification  to such an extent that about 85% of visas have gone to Asians and Latin  Americans. The current bill retains an emphasis on family unity and increases  the number of family-related visas.  </P> <P> However, by raising the overall numbers substantially, it leaves room for  20,000 "diversity visas" for natives of regions "adversely affected" by current  law. In addition, the legislation seeks to make it easier for persons with  special skills or education to enter the country.  </P> <P> President Bush has supported a Senate-passed version of the legislation that  limited total immigration to 630,000 per year. However, he had warned House  members that he would veto their version of the legislation, which provided for  775,000 annual visas.  </P> <P> Administration officials declined to predict whether he would support or veto  the legislation passed by the conference committee.  </P> <P> Conferees, however, praised their agreement, saying that the compromise  represents the best deal that could be reached to increase legal immigration  from countries with low levels of immigrants, while preserving existing  emphasis on family reunification.  </P> <P> "This is a good bill," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City), a sponsor  of the House bill and one of the conference negotiators. "It could have been a  much better bill, but we did pretty well."  </P> <P> Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), another member of the conference committee,  said that the bill would "open new opportunities for immigrants with skills and  talents we need, while increasing opportunities for family reunification."  </P> <P> Under the compromise, during the first three years 520,000 of the total 700,000  visas would be used by families seeking to bring in family members. About  140,000 visas would be used for those with special job skills and 20,000 for  persons with special skills and talents.  </P> <P> After 1995, the family visa allotment would fall to 480,000, with 140,000  reserved for workers and 55,000 for persons from low-immigration regions.  </P> <P> Technically there is no cap for the admission of minor children, spouses and  parents of U.S. citizens. However immigration officials expect no more than  200,000 "immediate relatives" to apply for visas. The remaining visas in the  family category are thus assumed to be open to non-immediate family members  such as siblings or aunts.  </P> <P> But Latino and Asian American groups complained that if the number of immediate  relatives seeking visas greatly exceeded expectations, non-immediate family  members would be squeezed out.  </P> <P> After the advocacy groups threatened to withdraw their support for the bill,  the committee made a deal which guarantees that at least 226,000 non-immediate  family members will be admitted.  </P> <P> Another provision in the bill, which calls for a pilot program allowing two  states to test the use of drivers' licenses as worker authorization documents,  drew anger from the immigrant rights activists. The provision is intended to  provide companies with a more tamper-proof method of verifying whether persons  who appear to be foreign are legally in the country and eligible for  employment. Civil libertarians have said that the proposal could lead to a  national identity card for workers.  </P> <P> "This is a separate issue and a volatile one for us," said Cecilia Munoz,  senior legislative assistant for the National Council of La Raza. "We go  ballistic over the idea of a national identity card and we accept this under no  circumstances."  </P> <P> The agreement also would establish a national policy for granting temporary  haven to persons who are unable to return to their native countries because of  civil war or domestic upheaval.  </P> <P> Under a special provision crafted for natives of war-ravaged El Salvador living  in the United States, the bill would require that they renew their work  documents every six months.  </P> <P> Another provision of the legislation would grant the secretary of health and  human services the right to determine a list of communicable diseases that  would bar persons from entering the country. This measure is expected to result  in the removal of AIDS patients from the list of persons denied entry. Harvard  University, which is slated to sponsor the 1992 International AIDS Conference,  had threatened to drop its sponsorship of the world's premier annual AIDS  meeting if AIDS patients remain on the list.  </P></p>

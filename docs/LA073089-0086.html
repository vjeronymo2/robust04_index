			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: BUSY ACTOR, THE OTHER MITCHUM  </P> <P> For the role of the Chandlereseque title character in the TV movie, "Jake  Spanner, Private Eye," producer Andrew Fenady thought of Robert Mitchum.  </P> <P> For the role of Jake's brother, Fenady came up with another natural: John  Mitchum, Bob's real-life brother -- and a veteran character actor who's logged  more than 70 feature and 400 TV appearances.  </P> <P> Due to air in November on the USA Network, "Jake Spanner" marks a first for the  Mitchum boys. They've acted together previously in features ("The Way West")  and TV ("The Family Man") -- but never before played brothers.  </P> <P> Speaking from his home in Nevada City, Calif. -- where he and wife Bonnie are  active in the local Foothill Theater -- John dubbed the assignment "a breeze."  Even though he takes a bullet during the action.  </P> <P> After all, said John, "Bob's the consummate professional. And I hope I'm  considered the same."  </P> <P> At 70, John is two years younger than the brother who has long overshadowed  him. "But there's no jealousy," declared John. "I feel very definitely that my  forte is as a character actor."  </P> <P> It would be hard, he said, to name a favorite role. "There've been so many --  and they've been so varied." But younger audiences may know him best as Clint  Eastwood's partner, Frank DiGiorgio, in "Dirty Harry," "Magnum Force" and "The  Enforcer."  </P> <P> Also a singer/songwriter -- he wrote "America, Why I Love Her," the only album  ever recorded by John Wayne -- John's currently at work on a massive project  that traces the historic roots of songs, hoping to put it out on audio  cassette. And he's just authored the anecdotal, "Them Ornery Mitchum Boys"  (Creatures at Large Press).  </P> <P> "It's about my brother -- and me." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The missing navigator Ron Arad has not been located  in Iran. Iranian President 'Ali Hashemi-Rafsanjani said this in  a news conference in Iran today. Rafsanjani emphasized that  Iran has nothing to do with Ron Arad's fate. He also  surprisingly declared Iran will not oppose the Middle East peace  process in practice, despite its opposition in principle to any  agreement with Israel.    A senior activist in the organization of Mustafa al-Dirani,  who was abducted to Israel, said in Beirut today that Iran is  actively aiding any organization hostile to Israel.    In reaction to Rafsanjani's comments, this evening, Israeli  security sources said Israel continues to regard Iran and its  satellites as responsible for Ron Arad's fate.</p>

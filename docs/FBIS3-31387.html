			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Feb 15 (CTK) -- Czech dailies today  highlight Czech political leaders' differences of opinion on the  NATO ultimatum issued to Bosnian Serbs and on possible aerial  attacks against them.    President Vaclav Havel has supported the possible attacks,  while Premier Vaclav Klaus was opposed to them and said on  Monday [14 February] that he was "fully" convinced that NATO  would not launch any attacks in Bosnia.    In the independent MLADA FRONTA DNES Jiri Leschtina writes  under the title "The Protracted Malaise of Foreign Policy" that  the ultimatum has once again laid bare "the insufficient  coordination of stances pronounced by the president, premier,  and head of diplomacy (Josef Zieleniec)."    "At the moment when NATO made the decision the president and  foreign minister were thousands of kilometers away on a state  visit (to India). But this was by no means a reason for the  premier to speak in Prague about the Czech Republic's fear of  outside intervention in Bosnia, followed by the president in  Bangkok expressing his satisfaction with the North Atlantic  Alliance's "baring its teeth."    "Given the present level of technology, what prevented  Vaclav  Havel, Vaclav Klaus, and Josef Zieleniec from coordinating their  vocabulary?," Leschtina asks.    He says that this was probably the "old well-known grating"  between the president, premier, and foreign minister, "which has  already produced the premier's and foreign minister's different  stances on the creation of a commission to negotiate with the  Sudeten Germans, and on the shoot-out between Vaclav Klaus and  Vaclav Havel over Rushdie's visit."    Leschtina says that these were only matters concerning the  Czech Republic and its neighborhood, but warns that "the Czech  state cannot afford differences of opinion between its president  and premier on the possible bombardment of a not remote European  country."    "There exists a mechanism (for leaders) to use the same  vocabulary: the Council for Foreign Policy Coordination, whose  existence was advocated by Zieleniec and which comprises the  president, the premier, the foreign minister, the heads of the  coalition parties, and other officials. But it has met only  once since November. Now, during one of Europe's most fatal  moments, it has a good opportunity to prove its viability,"  Leschtina stresses.    In the left-orientated RUDE PRAVO Robert Dengler writes that  "however much Klaus may now be repeating that his and the  president's stances differ only in emphasis, the premier's  attitude last week was unequivocal: Not to bombard, because it  would be unfair to the people, producing only further massacres  and disasters. In fact there was no difference in emphasis, but  the two attitudes are entirely different."    "The ensuing confusion around clarification of the real  official stand (on such a serious matter as the war in the  Balkans), can eventually threaten the credibility of figures  (?individual) and create the impression that not even statements  by constitutional officials are reliable," Dengler stresses.    In the right-oriented daily TELEGRAF Martin Danes writes:  "The fact that keeping a certain distance from the conflict does  not improve, to say the least, the Czech Republic's fame abroad,  has probably been comprehended even by Foreign Minister  Zieleniec, who had rather espoused the premier's stance at the  beginning. Zieleniec's silence during the president's (Asian)  trip, on which he accompanied him, amounts to agreement with his  views."    The independent daily LIDOVE NOVINY asked Jiri Payne,  chairman of the parliamentary Foreign Committee, to comment on  the differences. Payne, a member of the Civic Democratic Party  (ODS), of which Klaus is the chairman, said: "If Vaclav Klaus'  view on such a serious matter differs from that of another  important constitutional official, he must have his own reasons  for this. But the difference need not be essential. Each of  them has different information.... It does not mean that he who  resolutely supports a solution by force has more morals than he  who hesitates. It is simply a question of weighing the pros and  cons. I personally do not feel that I have enough information  to take a clear-cut stance."    The chief of staff of the Czech Army, Jiri Nekvasil, told  LIDOVE NOVINY that "to advise NATO whether or not to launch  aerial intervention in Bosnia would not be correct, the more so  because the Czech Air Force would not take part in the attack.  I can only confirm that the armies of the alliance have  equipment which can precisely hit selected targets... But the  question must be asked what would follow."</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore spending Pounds 13m to buy in shares FROGMORE ESTATES, a property investment company, yesterday announced plans to spend Pounds 13.1m in buying in its own shares for cancellation. It has asked its shareholders permission to buy 5.2m shares or 13.1 per cent of its share capital from Markheath, another property company. The Markheath stake was the rump of a 27.2 per cent interest - totalling 10.9m shares - in Frogmore it accumulated between June 1988 and April 1990. In April 1991, it sold 4m shares to Southend Properties, which launched an unsuccessful Pounds 139m bid for Frogmore. Southend later sold its stake in Frogmore to Regalian Properties in October 1991. Regalian sold the stake in June this year. The proposed price is 250p a share. This compared to its share price of 279p, after a rise of 9p yesterday, and a reported net asset value per share of 411p at June 30. Frogmore said the deal would increase its net assets per share from 411p to 435p. Its gearing would increase to around 40 per cent. It is seeking approval from its investors because it does not have the existing authority to buy its own shares and because it is buying from a substantial shareholder. Markheath's shares were unchanged yesterday at 6 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>941119 FT  19 NOV 94 / Weekend Money (Investing For Income): Permanent interest-bearing shares ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pibs are the closest you can get to holding ordinary shares in a building society. They are fixed interest securities with no redemption date - so your capital cannot be guaranteed. You can realise your investment only by selling them on the open market - with the chance of capital gain or loss. They provide a relatively high yield, as the table shows. This is partly because a building society is theoretically not obliged to pay out if doing so would drive it into loss. Also, the market is relatively small and the shares are not always easy to buy and sell.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         Coupon     Issue  Minimum   Price*    Yield*                                    price Stock                (gross %)       (p)    (Pds)      (p) (gross %)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Birmingham Midshires     9.375   100.165    1,000    86.75    10.801 Bradford &amp; Bingley      11.625   100.129   10,000   111.00    10.473 Bradford &amp; Bingley      13        100.2    10,000   122.50    10.612 Bristol &amp; West          13.375   100.338    1,000   123.50    10.830 Britannia               13       100.423    1,000   120.00    10.833 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucs     11.75    100.962   50,000   114.00    10.307 Coventry                12.125   100.749    1,000   112.50    10.763 First National          11.75    100.247   10,000   100.50    11.692 Halifax                  8.75    100.615   50,000    85.25    10.264 Halifax                 12       100.28    50,000   115.50    10.390 Leeds &amp; Holbeck         13.375   100.227    1,000   122.50    11.918 Leeds Permanent         13.625   100       50,000   126.00    10.813 Newcastle               10.75    100.317    1,000    99.13    10.845 Newcastle               12.625   100.446    1,000   115.50    11.931 North of England        12.625   100.135    1,000   116.75    10.814 Skipton                 12.875   100.476    1,000   118.25    10.888  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Purchase price as at midday Nov 17 excluding accrued interest.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Hoare Govett  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

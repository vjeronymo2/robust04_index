			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hindi </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [News Report: "BJP To Start Anti-Dunkel Campaign"] </F>   [Text] New Delhi, 19 December--The BJP has decided to start  a nationwide movement to protest the government's decision to  approve the Dunkel draft. The BJP has appealed to the people to  tell the world that the government had approved this proposal  against their wishes. The BJP has also decided to introduce a  resolution over this issue in the Parliament. It has also hinted  about approaching other parties for cooperation on this issue.  The Party said that the day the Narasimha Rao government will  sign agreement over the Dunkel draft will be remembered as a  black day' in this India's history. The national working  committee of the BJP also passed a resolution about it on  Saturday evening after a long meeting.    Atal Behari Vajpayee, the Lok Sabha opposition leader, said  while issuing the resolution that India was expected to lead the  developing countries in dealing with the dangers of the Dunkel  draft. However, a weak government knelt down in front of the  United States and the European union of nations. The BJP  resolution said that it had repeatedly warned the government  against the multi-national companies and their agents. He said  that we had asked for fair trade and not open trade. What did we  get? An agreement that has seriously hurt the interests of poor  nations. The third world countries will have to live in the  shadows of fear of a new kind of colonialism.    The BJP said that the Indian government had hurt the  nation's  interests by accepting the Dunkel draft. The damage to the  agricultural area is extreme. Export of garments will also  suffer badly. The Indian government bowed down both in Trips and  Trims pacts. The resolution also referred to the commerce  minister's statement make in the Parliament on 16 December in  which he had admitted that other countries had started to defy  the U.S. and European pressure while our government was helpless  on this issue. The BJP expressed surprise that the commerce  minister who was expected to protect the interests of the nation  was not embarrassed when he announced this.    The resolution said that the commerce minister was telling  proudly that India's export will increase by 1.5 to 2 billion  dollars. The BJP asks if a country's autonomy can be sold or  bought? The resolution reminds the commerce minister that China  is not a member of GATT, did not participate in the Dunkel  talks, and yet still managed to increase its exports by many  times during the last few years.    Mr. Vajpayee said that whatever the government says, the  truth is that multinational companies like Cargil will continue  to twist our arms. Some companies have already started to do  that over our neem trees. The resolution expressed concern that  the price of grains will be controlled by international trends  now and that this will adversely effect our economic autonomy.  We have seen that happen in Africa. As the result of signing the  Trips pact, drug prices have skyrocketed. The government said  about Trips that it will decide on where the foreign investments  will be. How can we expect a government that opens its markets  to multinational companies to manufacture soda water and potato  chips to stand boldly?    The BJP leader said that his party has been opposing several  Dunkel issues related to agriculture for the last two years. Now  it appears that this proposal is detrimental to our national  interests in other areas also. Mr. Vajpayee said that the  government has until 10 April of the next year. It should make  necessary amendments to the Dunkel Draft to help our country and  other developing countries.</p>

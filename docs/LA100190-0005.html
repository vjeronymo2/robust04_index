			<p><P> October 1, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICAN MEMORY BEING SLICED AWAY  </P> <P> Ken Burns' superb Civil War series on public television reminded us how lucky  we were not to have fought in that war but how doubly lucky we are that our  great-grandfathers did, and that everything came out the way it did. But  today's epic battles are being fought in courthouses and zoning commissions,  and this time history is too often the loser.  </P> <P> Last week in Culpeper County, Va., they reached a decision in the second battle  of Brandy Station. The good side lost. Down the road in Hanover County, they  are still fighting the second battle of Cold Harbor, and so far the bulldozers  are ahead.  </P> <P> Where Union horsemen surprised Jeb Stuart and brought on the greatest cavalry  fight in American history, soon there will be the greatest industrial park in  Culpeper County. The developer there got permission to proceed after agreeing  to set aside 248 acres of the 1,445-acre tract as a historic site. But those  248 acres are steep land where nothing much happened in 1863; the plateau where  the head-on clash of cavalry took place will be unprotected.  </P> <P> That is the sort of one-sided compromise by which field after field of American  memory is being sliced away, to leave little that reminds of who fought there,  and how.  </P></p>

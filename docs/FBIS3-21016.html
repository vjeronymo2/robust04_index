The NRSC has access to over 2 million photographic  images acquired over the last 19 years.    Panchromatic and multispectral images acquired by Resource  satellites offer a best ground resolution of five metres which  is sufficient to define streets and buildings, says the NRSC.  This is said to be ideal for the generation of image maps for  use by cartographers, geologists and urban planners. An oil  company recently ordered imagery of the pre-Caspian Basin in  Kazakhstan to identify oil wells and roads.    The NRSC distribution stems from the formation of WorldMap,  a  consortium comprising Jebco, Priroda (Russia's leading civilian  remote sensing organisation) and Rosvneshgeo (a Russian company  associated with geology and mineral exploration). WorldMap is  addressing the problems of exploiting Russian satellite imagery,  difficulties such as data conversion, cataloguing, prompt  delivery, quality, and payment.    Resource photographic films are archived by Priroda and  WorldMap has embarked on a massive digital conversion project.  About 500 scenes a month are being put on 8 mm Exabyte tape.  Two Vexcel VX3000 scanners are linked to Sun Microsystems SPARC  workstation. The scanners are capable of pixel spacing down to  8.5 microns.    All tapes are archived in London. A catalogue allows data  search. Delivery from London takes a matter of days, whilst  delivery of images not yet available from London usually only  takes 10 days. Previously, payment had to be made in advance  and delivery often took months.    Priroda operates two satellite types, Resource F-1 and F-2.  Three or four flights per year are made, each lasting about 30  days, with a maximum of 17 days of photography. Vertical  incidence imagery is available at latitudes up to 82.3o and  specific areas can be overflown on request.</p>

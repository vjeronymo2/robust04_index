			<p>Language: <F P=105> Lithuanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Rostyslav Bilodid, Ukrainian ambassador </F> extraordinary and plenipotentiary to Lithuania, by Algimantas  Zukas in Vilnius; date not given: "The Visit Is Necessary for  Peace Rather Than War"]    [Excerpts] [Zukas] Ukrainian President Leonid  Kravchuk is arriving on an official visit to Lithuania today.  Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas stated a week ago what  the two leaders had to discuss.    [Bilodid] [passage omitted] Opinions about the possible  military alliance sometimes voiced in the Seimas [parliament]  are totally ungrounded. This is a manifestation of political  atavism. A security vacuum has emerged after the USSR collapse.  This issue is important to every politician. The problem of  security can be tackled individually and in cooperation, but not  through a military alliance. We will look for common issues in  reducing possible dangers. We would not like this to be  interpreted as actions directed against Russia or other  countries. It would be naive to think that Russia can be  bypassed or ignored. We often come across political naivete  which sometimes stirs negative emotions. Compromises bear much  better fruit. We will seek certain compromises during the  visit, but definitely not military alliances.    [Zukas] Ukraine will, probably, not refuse to  participate in such an initiative as the "Partnership for  Peace."    [Bilodid] It is difficult to oppose this initiative. The  Ukrainian Government assesses it positively, and I have not  heard any hostile opinions, although there are different views.  Certainly, the official stand will be voiced. Honestly  speaking, however, this partnership is a palliative, a  compromise. We will yet have to consider the formulations and  concepts. We see, however, that Western countries are not ready  to take us into their arms immediately. Moreover, it is naive  and not serious to forget Russia which is being pictured now as  a monster. We must take its reaction into account because we  are realistic politicians. We do not need another Yugoslavia or  Georgia. However, all this is happening next to us, and it is  very worrisome. [passage omitted]    [Zukas] Many people assess the situation in the  neighboring Belarus as the "hunt for one of the Belovezh forest  bisons." Not everyone in Ukraine approves of President L.  Kravchuk's policy. Do you not think that the hunt for the  second "Belovezh bison" is possible?    [Bilodid] The situation in Belarus differs from that in  Ukraine, and any analogies are meaningless. I believe that  "storms" in the parliament encourage the development of the  nation's collective mind. It is very important that the  president has preserved peace in the state which has 53 million  very different people. We have no "hot spots." The economy has  declined considerably, but one should not forget the reasons.  The foundation for a crisis was laid for 50 years at least.  The USSR would direct all the money earned by Ukraine in the  post-war period to other regions. Ukraine had a large  industrial infrastructure, but the finances were not returned,  and the capital stock became obsolete. [passage omitted]    [Zukas] You are a representative of the sciences not  only by your education. You worked in this sphere before  entering diplomacy. Does your former experience help you find  your way in political intricacies?    [Bilodid] I assess history will all seriousness. Physics  allows me to look for similarities between the two sciences.  Parallels can be very interesting. The theory of phase  transformations is an exact reflection of those changes which we  call the transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This is  only one analogy between the two sciences. Our two countries  are creating versatile communities which previously knew only  two colors -- of friends and foes. The vectors of your current  interests are pointed at the East, the West, the North, and they  almost bypass the South. This was also noted by the Foreign  Policy Council for the Lithuanian president. Our embassy is  trying to arouse your interest in the neighbors from the south.  I am returning to physics again: The concept of stability  states that if a system has only one degree of freedom, the  level of stability is very low or it hardly exists. If there are  three degrees of freedom, stability is guaranteed. It is the  same in politics: The more ties a country has, the more stable  its situation in the world is. A separate state is always  lonely.    [Zukas] However, relations between Ukraine and  Lithuania are not too bright as well.    [Bilodid] I have always thought about human relations.  Certain things have changed today. Ukraine did not advocate  the introduction of visas. We know that Lithuania was not  interested in this too much. However, this is Lithuania's  business. As soon as Lithuania introduced visas, we did the  same. People have very clearly felt the emergence of visas.  Our previous communication was much easier. Now we have been  left with trains alone, although we are willing to negotiate air  traffic again. Moreover, not every person can pay five U.S.  dollars for a visa because the average wage is only $10-15.  This reduces possibilities for cultural and scientific  cooperation.    [Zukas] How do you personally feel in Lithuania?    [Bilodid] I have known Lithuania for a long time and I love  it gently. I have spent many summers in the environs of  Ignalina, and I would not exchange it for the Crimea or any  other place. I myself asked to be appointed to Lithuania,  although my diplomatic experience (10 years in the International  Atomic Energy Agency, and six years in the United Nations)  allowed me to choose.

			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOYNIHAN TAX CUT PLAN GETS BOOST FROM PARTY;  </P> <P> POLITICS: DEMOCRATS ON LEADERSHIP COUNCIL AND NATIONAL COMMITTEE PRAISE  PROPOSAL TO TRIM LEVY FOR SOCIAL SECURITY. BACKERS SEE CAMPAIGN ADVANTAGES.  </P> <P> Democratic leaders acted on two fronts Friday to seize the initiative in the  national economic policy debate with President Bush by promoting a  controversial proposal to cut the Social Security payroll tax.  </P> <P> In New Orleans, the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of centrist elected  officials, gave a warm reception to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.),  author of the controversial proposal to reduce the payroll tax from the current  6.2% to 5.1%.  </P> <P> Moynihan, whose appearance highlighted the opening session of the council's  two-day policy conference, charged that the Bush Administration was "looting"  the Social Security trust fund to help reduce the federal deficit.  </P> <P> "You could go to jail in other walks of life for doing that," Moynihan said.  </P> <P> Moynihan's proposed rate cut would provide workers who earn the Social Security  maximum -- $54,300 in 1991 -- with a tax savings of $600 a year. It would put  Social Security on more of a pay-as-you-go basis, eliminating the surpluses now  being used to defray the deficit.  </P> <P> Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.) praised the Moynihan approach for reducing the  tax burden on middle-income taxpayers and for protecting the trust fund. "If we  (Democrats) don't stand for those principles, what do we stand for?" Penny  demanded.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Indianapolis, the Democratic National Committee moved toward  adoption of a resolution endorsing the Moynihan proposal.  </P> <P> The resolution, submitted by New York state party chairman John Marino at the  instigation of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, was taken up Friday by the DNC executive  committee. It was expected to receive the backing of the full DNC, the party's  governing body, at today's's session.  </P> <P> Flying to New Orleans from Indianapolis for a brief visit, Democratic National  Committee Chairman Ron Brown called the Moynihan plan "a stroke of genius."  Brown said that Moynihan "has touched a real nerve by daring the Administration  to come clean and admit to what they've been up to."  </P> <P> As Brown and other backers of the Moynihan plan pointed out, the New York  senator's proposal offers Democrats several political advantages.  </P> <P> First, it focuses attention on the Bush Administration's use of the Social  Security trust fund, which has been growing steadily in recent years, to reduce  the size of the deficit.  </P> <P> Second, it helps Democrats shed their traditional reputation as tax boosters by  casting them as tax cutters instead.  </P> <P> Finally, it could strengthen the appeal of the Democrats among lower- and  middle-income wage earners, who Moynihan contends bear an unfair share of the  nation's tax burden and who have defected from the Democratic Party in large  numbers in the past three presidential elections.  </P> <P> "I'd love to have a floor debate on cutting Social Security versus cutting  capital gains," said Democratic House Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania,  referring to Bush's proposal to reduce capital gains taxes to spur economic  growth.  </P> <P> Gray predicted that if Moynihan's proposal reaches the House floor it would  pass overwhelmingly. "This is good policy, and it's good politics, too," he  said.  </P> <P> Not all participants in the Democratic Leadership Council session were  enthusiastic about the Moynihan plan.  </P> <P> Rep. J. J. Pickle (D-Tex.) cautioned Democrats that "we should be careful in  our glee and excitement" until a way has been devised to offset the decline in  general revenues, which would significantly widen the deficit.  </P> <P> By Moynihan's calculations, his proposal would cause a loss of $62 billion in  tax revenues over the next two years.  </P> <P> Another objection was raised by Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Tex.), chairman of the  Senate Finance Committee, who worried that enactment of the Moynihan plan would  touch off "a tax cut bidding war" between Democrats and Republicans in  Congress.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, Friday's developments represented the biggest boost for  Moynihan's proposal since he introduced it late last year to the surprise and  consternation of many Republicans and some Democrats.  </P> <P> Even those who voiced objections to specific aspects of the Moynihan plan  indicated they would be willing to consider a modified form of the proposal.  </P> <P> Bentsen, for example, said he would study the possibility of simply rolling  back the payroll tax increase that went into effect this year, when the payroll  tax rate jumped from 6.06% to 6.2%.  </P> <P> Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), the House majority leader who is heading a  task force to develop a Democratic tax strategy, said he could not predict  whether the Moynihan proposal would receive widespread support.  </P> <P> But Gephardt said Moynihan had "tapped two very important issues," by focusing  attention on the use of the Social Security trust fund and the tax burden on  middle-class wage earners. "Democrats are going to try to embody these themes  in the positions they take," he said.  </P> <P> The generally positive reaction to the Moynihan plan at the New Orleans meeting  contrasted with a lack of visible interest in a deficit reduction plan offered  two weeks ago by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski  (D-Ill.).  </P> <P> Rostenkowski proposed freezing most government spending programs, including  cost of living increases for Social Security beneficiaries, while raising taxes  on oil, pollutants, alcohol and tobacco. Many Democrats regard the proposal as  politically risky, particularly in the absence of strong backing from the  Administration.  </P> <P> The Moynihan proposal has been sharply criticized by the Bush Administration.  Budget Director Richard G. Darman has contended that by increasing the budget  deficit, the plan risks "fiscal policy havoc."  </P> <P> Bush has labeled the plan "a charade" designed to get him to raise income taxes  to meet the increased burden on the deficit.  </P></p>

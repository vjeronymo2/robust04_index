			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Tihomir Vinkovic from Vienna] </F>   [Excerpt] Muslim-Croat talks on the implementation of the  Washington agreement resumed today. Croats and Bosniaks  discussed canton borders of the Federation, Croatian Foreign  Minister Mate Granic said at the end of this morning's round of  talks. The maps are still in front of the negotiators. Where  is the solution? I think that we made an important step forward  and our standpoints on central Bosnia are converging, Kresimir  Zubak, the head of the Croat delegation from Bosnia-Herzegovina  said, adding that the delegations are continuing to present  their views on Herzegovina, and that the process of  harmonization continues. It seems that the main reason why no  agreement has yet been reached are the internal cantonal borders  of the Bosniak-Croat Federation. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STATE DOCTORS GROUP ASKED TO CONSIDER SPRAYING HALT  </P> <P> Three Southland physicians have asked the California Medical Assn. to consider  a resolution that calls for the termination of malathion spraying until safety  concerns have been assessed.  </P> <P> The resolution, which is scheduled to be discussed by the CMA's executive board  today at the start of the group's annual meeting at the Disneyland Hotel,  alleges that the state has not proven that the pesticide used to eradicate the  Mediterranean fruit fly is safe.  </P> <P> Gov. George "Deukmejian seems more concerned with fruit flies than with  humans," said H. Rex Greene, a Pasadena physician who along with two other  doctors introduced the resolution. "The state has not shown (malathion) to be  safe. If it's not shown to be safe, they have no business dumping it on  citizens."  </P> <P> The one-page resolution cites "acknowledged data gaps" in federal and state  studies of malathion risks, asks if spraying contributes to ground-water  contamination and points out that Japan has banned the use of the chemical.  </P> <P> The statement calls for the "immediate halt to aerial malathion spraying" and  asks the other 38,000 members of the medical association to write letters to  elected officials demanding that spraying be stopped.  </P> <P> Jane Wessell, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health, said Thursday  that she had not heard about the resolution and could not comment about  specific parts of it. However, she did compare the resolution to other failed  legislative and court actions taken by Southern California cities to halt  spraying.  </P> <P> "Everyone is doing that. What's so different about that?" Wessell asked. "They  have a . . . hysteria going on."  </P> <P> The CMA's executive board will decide whether the resolution warrants being  heard at the association's annual meeting.  </P></p>

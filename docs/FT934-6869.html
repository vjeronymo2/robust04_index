			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / People: Finance moves Gerry Grimstone, who joined Schroders from the Treasury seven years ago, has moved out of the investment banking division to head the newly created international financing and advisory department. Whereas investment banking handles UK mergers and acquisitions and flotations as well as overseas M &amp; A work in those countries where the bank has a local presence, Grimstone's new domain has taken charge of equity capital market activities worldwide. Current assignments include advising the Greek government on the privatisation of the telecommunications company OTE and the Italians on the INA life assurance company sell-off. Grimstone's department falls within the new international finance division under group managing director William Slee. Bernard Dewe Mathews, who looks after international projects and contractor advisory and financing activities, heads the other department, to be known as the international projects department.</p>

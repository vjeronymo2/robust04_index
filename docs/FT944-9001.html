			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: Some upgrades are more equal than others Sir, I was not surprised to hear of Kim Fairweather's experiences with BA (Letters, November 12/13). I have been a regular business traveller with BA for many years, and I am also a silver tier member of the frequent flyer programme. I also have never been offered an upgrade. I have even had to pay to upgrade, when my male travelling companion has been offered a free upgrade. This discrimination does not only apply to upgrades. My male colleagues frequently receive vouchers or bottles of wine when they complain about re-routings or bad service. All I get is an obsequious letter, not explaining the problem, and stating how much they value my custom. BA is like the curate's egg - good in parts - but for the female business traveller, the good parts are increasingly hard to find. Jill Jones, Thatched Cottage, Wainhill, Chinnor, Oxfordshire OX9 4AB From Dr Paul Marett. Sir, With regard to airline upgrades, I do not fly very frequently. However, I am a regular first class traveller on British Rail. I should be annoyed if, when I had paid a considerably higher fare for first class travel, standard class passengers were 'upgraded' to any empty seats without extra payment. Paul Marett, 20 Barrington road, Stoneygate, Leicester LE2 2RA</p>

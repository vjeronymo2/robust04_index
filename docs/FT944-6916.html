			<p>941128 FT  28 NOV 94 / High redundancy offer likely for Halifax and Leeds staff Generous voluntary redundancy terms are likely to be offered to the 27,000-plus staff of Halifax and Leeds Permanent, two of the UK's largest building societies, as part of the plans for combining the organisations. Mr Mike Blackburn, Halifax chief executive, will today meet the society's head-office managers to spell out the agreement to merge and become a public limited company, the UK's third-largest high street bank with Pounds 90bn in assets. Later this week he will meet managers at the Leeds, and meetings with unions are also planned. Members of the two societies should receive letters setting out the broad outline of the agreement within the next two weeks, and a helpline for customers will operate from today. The overlap of the two societies' branch networks has already brought warnings from staff organisations that hundreds of jobs are at risk. While the societies' managements have not ruled out compulsory redundancies, they would prefer job losses to be voluntary. If not, they could face opposition not only from employees but also from customers who do not want to see a threat to staff in the 1,100 branches or a cut in the service provided. The deal must have the approval of 10m investors and borrowers who own the two societies. Savings from combining the two networks will be an important part of making the deal a success. The societies' boards must avoid announcing such a tough approach to job losses that the merger falters while ensuring they rationalise the branches fast enough to prevent a rise in costs. On average, about 5 per cent of the 22,000 Halifax staff are likely to leave and be replaced during a year through normal staff turnover, but this proportion would not be spread evenly either among branches or between the society's operations. 'There will be short-term reductions in employment,' Mr Blackburn said. 'But we hope they can be achieved by normal turnover, early retirement and voluntary redundancies.' He said the societies wanted to give members as much information as they could, but it was not known whether they could be told how free shares would be allocated at flotation before they voted on the merger at special general meetings in March. If the societies' merger is approved, it will probably take place in early summer. The second vote, on whether to float the combined society, is unlikely until 1996.

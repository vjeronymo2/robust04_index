			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (8): A good read by any measure EVEN THE fanciest electronic calculator will jibe at the quirks of the world's systems for measuring and quantifying. When is a billion a milliard? What is a trillionth? The answers depend on where the questions are asked. Thank goodness, then, for The Economist Desk Companion (Century Business/Economist Books Pounds 20, 272 pages), which takes over from the World Measurement Guide and goes a megametre forward. It gives an authoritative description of the metric system, arguing that it will be standard by the end of the present decade. A series of chapters gives industry definitions and terms of everything from shoe sizes to shotgun bores. The sections on weapons and space are particularly fascinating. The danger of such information is that employees will spend time reading the book rather than simply finding what they were looking for. Managers should keep it locked in a desk drawer. The last third of the book consists of conversion tables. There are even tables for calculating mortgage payments and APR interest rates. All in all, this is a thoroughly useful book and worth every penny.</p>

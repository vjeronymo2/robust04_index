			<p>921214 FT  14 DEC 92 / Observer: Piris tops the summit If there was ever a lawyer-of-the-year award then Jean-Claude Piris, head of the legal service at the European Council, deserves it. He is the unsung hero of the Edinburgh summit for the way he helped devise a solution to Denmark's demands for legally binding exemptions to the Maastricht treaty. A graduate of the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the 49-year-old Piris is a rare breed of international civil servant. A lawyer by training, he also possesses a keen political instinct as shown by his conviction that, in the end, the Danish question was always a 'matter of presentation.' His political nose, well-honed by stints in the UN and the OECD as well as the Brussels bureaucracy, proved indispensable as he joined lawyers from the British Foreign Office in finding a solution to the Danish problem: how to meet Copenhagen's demands for legally-binding opt-outs from Maastricht without re-opening the treaty or triggering re-ratification in member states. Before and during the summit, Piris faced what amounted to a Spanish inquisition, first from foreign ministers, and then from heads of government on whether his wording undermined the letter and spirit of the Maastricht treaty. In the end, the agreement reached on Saturday drew praise all round. EC president Jacques Delors, described it as 'extremely subtle", and Danish officials said it was 'devilishly clever'. Piris, who speaks fluent English, had a broad idea of how to resolve the Danish question as early as last September. But it was only in the final weeks before the Edinburgh summit that the UK presidency called upon Piris. Like the battle of Waterloo, it was a close run thing.</p>

			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. AGREES TO PAY 20 HURT IN FAIRFAX EXPLOSION;  </P> <P> AUTUMN TRIAL EXPECTED FOR SUITS AGAINST OTHERS STEMMING FROM 1985 BLAST AT  STORE  </P> <P> Four years after a methane gas explosion ripped through a Fairfax-area clothing  store, the city of Los Angeles has tentatively agreed to pay $75,000 to 20  people injured in the blast and to the store's insurance company.  </P> <P> The settlement would free the city from any further liability involving a  series of lawsuits that are scheduled to go to trial as one consolidated case  this fall. Seven other defendants, including the County of Los Angeles and the  Southern California Gas Co., have already agreed to pay $364,000 in separate  settlements.  </P> <P> The city attorney's office has estimated that a jury verdict in favor of the  blast victims would probably exceed $3 million, and an attorney for the victims  and the insurance company said he will seek at least $10 million in damages.  The insurance company, Industrial Indemnity, is seeking $2.25 million to  recover claims resulting from the blast.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Good Settlement'  </P> <P> "Although the city ought to prevail if these actions were tried, the potential  recovery by the plaintiffs is very large," the city attorney wrote in a report  to the City Council. The city should settle "because of the extraordinary  expenses involved in proceeding to trial and the risk involved due to the  substantial damages suffered by the plaintiffs."  </P> <P> The City Council's Finance and Revenue Committee, following the city attorney's  advice, recommended Tuesday that the council approve the settlement. The full  City Council is expected to approve it in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> Assistant City Atty. Philip Shiner, who has handled the case, said in an  interview that it would cost the city at least $75,000 to fight the case in  court. He said it was safer for the city to pay the money up front and avoid  further litigation. "It could be significant if (the jury) finds somebody at  fault," he said. "It is a good settlement."  </P> <P> Shiner said there were several other victims of the blast who are not part of  the consolidated case, but, he said, none of them have active suits against the  city. The city attorney's report to the council said other "minor claims"  against the city may arise in the future, but it concluded that "whatever  remains will not present any significant potential exposure to the city."  </P> <P> The March 24, 1985, blast destroyed the Ross Dress For Less store on West 3rd  Street, injured 23 people and forced the Fire Department to close off a  four-square-block area for several days. Several of the victims received  serious injuries, including one woman who was burned over 50% of her body and  another who suffered burns on her hands, feet, legs and body.  </P> <P> In their consolidated case against the city, the victims and insurance company  alleged that the city contributed to the explosion in the clothing store's  basement by paving streets and sidewalks around the store.  </P> <P> The city's paved areas, the suit alleged, prevented underground methane gas  from venting naturally into the atmosphere and forced it to migrate under the  store and eventually inside it. The suit also alleged that the city's sewers  and storm drains acted as a passageway for the gas to enter the building.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Defendants  </P> <P> Matthew B. F. Biren, the attorney for the victims and Industrial Indemnity in  the consolidated case, said he is negotiating settlements with three other  defendants, including the state of California. If those discussions are  successful, he said, the trial would proceed against just two defendants: Park  La Brea Associates (and its owners at the time, Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.  and May Co.) and McFarland Energy Co.  </P> <P> Park La Brea owned the West 3rd Street property, and McFarland Energy operated  nearby oil wells, which Biren alleges caused underground gas to migrate beneath  the clothing store. Biren said his clients were willing to settle with the city  of Los Angeles and the other defendants because they are considered "peripheral  to the issue."  </P> <P> "After having conducted tremendous investigation into the facts surrounding the  accident, it appears the most likely thing facilitating the methane gas  migration was the active slant wells being operated by McFarland Energy," Biren  said. "We are confident that was what led to the migration of the methane gas  to the explosion."  </P> <P> McFarland has denied responsibility for the blast. Company officials did not  return phone calls Tuesday.  </P></p>

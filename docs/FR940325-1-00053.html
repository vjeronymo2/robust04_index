			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The membership of a technical review team would be selected by the multiple resource advisory council, or rangeland resource team where chartered under FACA. The technical review team would be required to include at least one member of the multiple resource advisory council or chartered rangeland resource team.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Rangeland resource teams and technical review teams serving in a fact-finding role for the purpose of providing input to the multiple resource advisory council would in no way preclude the collection and analysis of scientific data by BLM, or the BLM's use of technical experts from outside of the Bureau. To the contrary, information collected by the fact-finding teams and BLM should be complementary and, in combination, would provide a multiple resource advisory council with a solid basis from which to form a recommendation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An alternative concept for technical review teams is also under consideration. Under this alternative, technical review teams would be formed to address specific unresolved technical issues by the BLM authorized officer on the motion of the BLM or in response to a request by the multiple resource advisory council. Where the technical review team is requested by the multiple resource advisory council, the charge for the technical review team would be written jointly by the BLM and the advisory council. The purpose of the team would be to gather and analyze data and develop recommendations to aid the decisionmaking process, and functions of the team would be limited to tasks assigned by the authorized officer. Review team members would be composed of BLM or other government employees, with at least one member from a State agency or a Federal agency other than BLM. The authorized officer would also be allowed to employ and compensate private sector consultants who would function as team members, and to compensate team members for per diem and travel expenses. The authorized officer, in consultation with the multiple resource advisory council, would determine team membership, establish the task of the technical review team, appoint a team leader, provide administrative support, and determine when the team should be disbanded. In the selection of team members, preference will be given to scientific and technical experts who have experience in the bio-physiographic region of concern.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The authorized officer would be required to specify a time period for the completion of the assigned task. Technical review teams would terminate upon completion of the task assigned, or the time period established by the authorized officer, whichever comes first.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The alternative concept for technical review teams would not result in the formation of advisory committees under the Federal Advisory Committee Act because team members would either be Federal or other government agency employees, or paid consultants. The Department invites public review and comment on this alternative as well as the concept for technical review teams included in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While specific functions for rangeland resource teams and technical review teams are outlined in this proposed rule, there is another reason for their creation. The teams are designed to facilitate input from the many consensus groups that have formed_and will form_throughout the West. Groups such as the Gunnison Group from Colorado, the Oregon Watershed Improvement Group and Wyoming's Sun Ranch Stewardship effort all took root voluntarily. These groups are proving that ranchers, environmentalists and others can come to agreement on land management practices. Rather than replace these kinds of groups, the new teams are designed to bring them closer to the process, to allow their influence to spread across the West.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although FLPMA requires that the Secretary establish advisory councils, there is no statutory requirement for the formation of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams. While the Department views the provisions for multiple resource advisory councils' use of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams as significant advances in the promotion of public participation and consensus-based decisionmaking, the Department recognizes that the success of the concept would hinge on many factors. Active participation, willingness to donate time and travel expenses, willingness to work collaboratively toward recommendations to the advisory councils, and knowledge of resource management principles are all critical to the success of the rangeland resource team and technical review team concept.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In recognition of the demanding requirements for the success of the two forms of input teams, the Department is considering an alternative of proposing the use of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams on an experimental basis rather than adopting the proposal BLM-wide. The Department invites the public to comment on the merits of providing for the use of rangeland resource teams and technical review teams on an experimental basis. Comments are specifically requested on the criteria for selecting areas for the experimental implementation of the rangeland resource teams and technical review teams. Criteria could include broad-based support for participation in a consensus-building approach among the interested parties, and interested parties having demonstrated the ability to work cooperatively and provide consensual advice on public rangeland issues.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

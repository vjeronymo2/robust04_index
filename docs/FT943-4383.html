			<p>940909 FT  09 SEP 94 / Financial advisers to campaign on costs A new trade association for independent financial advisers was launched yesterday, with the promise to campaign for its members on issues such as rising regulatory costs, Alison Smith writes. There has been concern among independent financial advisers that their interests were in danger of being lost compared with the lobbying strength of large life-insurance companies. The IFA Association has been formed from the National Federation of Independent Financial Advisers, which had about 2,000 members, and a further 1,200 advisers who were in the financial-services element of the British Insurance and Investment Brokers' Association. It hopes to have about 4,000 members by the end of the year. Its chief executive is Mr Garry Heath, formerly chief executive of the national federation. The association will represent the sector's views to regulators, the government and other organisations, such as consumer groups. Its first campaigns will focus on the costs of regulation, arrangements for paying compensation to customers who have suffered poor advice on pension transfers, and the rising cost of professional indemnity insurance. It will also highlight the potential threat to the widespread availability of independent financial advice if hundreds of advisers do not apply to join the Personal Investment Authority, the new regulator to protect the private investor.</p>

			<p><P> November 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> CORONADO;  </P> <P> ANTI-RV ORDINANCE ALSO SNAGS CADILLACS  </P> <P> A new ordinance intended to prevent Coronado residents from storing  recreational vehicles on city streets is so strict it requires police to  impound big cars like Cadillacs and Lincolns, officials have found. The city  law bars vehicles longer than 18 feet from parking on residential streets for  more than three hours. City Council members passed the measure in response to  numerous complaints about motor homes, considered a blight by many in this  affluent town across the bay from San Diego. To show the city meant business,  police have hauled off five RVs in the past month. Police Chief Jerry Boyd said  that limousines "are longer than 18 feet, so I guess they are included in the  ordinance."  </P></p>

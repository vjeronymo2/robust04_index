			<p><P> May 2, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ORANGE;  </P> <P> TRIPLETS' BIRTH MARKED BY USE OF NEW PROCEDURE  </P> <P> Irvine computer operator Linda Nielsen helped make medical history Sunday  evening when she gave birth to triplets.  </P> <P> The baby girls, Jennifer Ann, Christina Marie and Katherine Michelle, were  diagnosed as healthy at only 9 weeks' gestation in an experimental diagnostic  technique called chorionic villus sampling, which was used for the first time  on the West Coast in Neilsen's case, according to their obstetrician, Arthur I.  Goldstein.  </P> <P> In the procedure, doctors removed a small sample of tissue from the membrane  surrounding each of of the three fetuses, and 2 weeks later, Nielsen learned  her babies did not have Down's syndrome or other genetic defects. The procedure  is expected to replace amniocentesis, a procedure that is performed much later  -- at 16 weeks' gestation.  </P> <P> By Monday afternoon, the babies were reported "doing well" in the special care  nursery at St. Joseph Hospital, spokesman Dennis Gaschen said. The babies --  still called Baby A, B and C because the Nielsens had not decided which name to  give which child -- were born by Caesarian section at 6:13, 6:14 and 6:15 p.m.  Sunday, Gaschen said.  </P> <P> Baby A weighed 4 pounds, 8 ounces and was l7 1/2 inches long; Baby B was 4  pounds, 6 ounces and l7 1/2 inches long, and Baby C was 3 pounds, 13 ounces and  17 1/2 inches long.  </P></p>

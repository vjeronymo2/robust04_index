			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These amendments <FOOTCITE>182</FOOTCITE>  more accurately describe the purpose of alternative containers and reduce any potential for confusion and misrepresentation concerning the types of containers that are available for use in cremations; <FOOTCITE>183</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 182 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> These changes require complementary ones to conform related Rule sections_references to an ``unfinished wood box'' in &sect;&sect;453.1(p) (definition), 453.3(b), and 453.4(a) also are deleted, as is the reference to ``pouches of canvas'' in the definitional section, and ``unfinished wood box'' is added to the definition of an ``alternative container'' (&sect;453.1(b)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 183 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 188&hyph;195 for a full discussion of the evidence on these amendments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (4) Amendment of the OBC&hyph;PL disclosure required by &sect;453.3(c)(2) to permit providers in disclosing that grave liners or vaults are not required by law to delete the phrase ``in most areas of the country,'' to accommodate situations where state and local laws do not require outer burial containers; <FOOTCITE>184</FOOTCITE>  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 184 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 198.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (5) Amendment of the substance of the cash advance mark-up disclosure, required by &sect;453.3(f)(2), to require only that providers specify those cash advance items for which the provider charges a mark-up. The Commission has determined that the original disclosure may have caused the misimpression that providers markup all cash advance items, because it broadly referred to all cash advance items, when that is not the case. <FOOTCITE>185</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 185 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 200&hyph;202.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 7. Other Minor/Technical Amendments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has made a slight modification to &sect;453.4(b)(2)(i)(B), a provision designed to enforce the Rule's unbundling provisions. The purpose for this provision was to inform consumers, before they sign the funeral contract, that they may only be charged for those items selected or for items that are required by law. If purchases are required by law or otherwise, this provision further provides consumers with an explanation in writing, together with the reason the requirement applies to their selections. The provision was intended to provide consumers with a final reminder that they need only pay for items that they have selected. <FOOTCITE>186</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 186 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> R&hyph;B&hyph;5 at 42292 (``Section 453.4(b), the `optional purchase' provision, ensures that consumers can make use of such price information by making a decision to decline items which they do not wish to purchase.'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has amended the required language in order to clarify for consumers the original purpose of the provision. It alerts consumers that they may only be charged for the goods and services that they choose, or that are required by law or by a cemetery or crematory (such as an outer burial container or a certain type of alternative container). <FOOTCITE>187</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 187 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 205.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission further adopts a technical change to &sect;453.6 concerning providers' retention of documents, to clarify its requirements. The original section required the funeral provider to retain a copy of the ``signed'' statement of goods and services selected. The Rule, however, does not contain any express requirement that the final statement be signed, either by the consumer or the provider. The Commission in its 1982 Statement of Basis and Purpose made no mention of the signature requirement. Earlier drafts of the Rule included a requirement that the funeral provider ask the consumer to sign the itemized statement, but it was not adopted in the final version. The ``signed'' language of &sect;453.6 was apparently inserted to complement the earlier draft of the Rule that contained the itemized statement requirement; however, when the signature requirement was deleted, the language of &sect;453.6 was inadvertently left intact. This language, however, is susceptible to different interpretations, and may lead some funeral providers to believe that they must obtain the signature of the consumer on the statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission therefore has amended the language of &sect;453.6 by deleting the phrase ``on which the statement was signed,'' and substituting the phrase ``of the arrangements conference,'' so that the provision now requires providers to maintain a copy of each statement of funeral goods and services selected ``for at least one year from the date of the arrangements conference.'' <FOOTCITE>188</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 188 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See the discussion at R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR), 218&hyph;219.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission, in addition, has added clarifying language to the required ``clear and conspicuous'' disclosure standard contained in &sect;453.7 of the Rule. That language clarifies that providers may not add statements or information to the Rule-required price lists that alter or contradict the information required to be included in those lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This specific prohibition is necessary to prevent violations of the ``clear and conspicuous'' standard that relate to provider detraction and potential consumer confusion problems demonstrated in the record. <FOOTCITE>189</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 189 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 219&hyph;220 for a full discussion of the evidence, and Commission precedents, relating to consumers' comprehension of Rule-required disclosures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, the Commission has:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Deleted the definition of ``Accounting year'' (&sect;453.1(a)), because that phrase does not appear elsewhere in the Rule;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) amended the definition of a ``casket'' (&sect;453.1(d)), to include those constructed of ``fiberglass'' and ``plastic'', because those types of caskets represent a significant portion of caskets produced in today's market; <FOOTCITE>190</FOOTCITE>  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 190 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See R&hyph;N&hyph;1 (SR) at 223; R&hyph;O&hyph;1 (POR) at 207. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (3) made a slight grammatical change to the definition of ``Funeral services'' (&sect;453.1(j)), to make it clear that the Rule only covers services that involve both the preparation of remains and the supervision of disposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> A JUNGLE OF OUR IMAGINATION;  </P> <P> PRIMATE VISIONS GENDER, RACE, AND NATURE IN THE WORLD OF MODERN SCIENCE BY  DONNA J. HARAWAY (ROUTLEDGE: $35; 472 PP., ILLUSTRATED; 0-415-90114-6)  </P> <P> "Primate Visions" is about the ways in which scientific accounts of the lives  of animals -- specifically those most closely related to us -- are intertwined  with our concepts of gender, race, and nature. Depictions of monkeys and apes  tell us much about ourselves, or, to paraphrase Pogo: "We have met the  primates, and they are us." Both scientific accounts and popular images of  monkeys and apes reflect sometimes-disturbing projections of human problems.  </P> <P> Haraway precedes from the assumption that monkeys and apes occupy the crucial  border zone between culture and nature; in the book we see them catapulted into  space, taught to communicate with humans, or portrayed as symbols of "lost  innocence" in a Third World devoid of indigenous human actors. In this  mythological terrain, a lone white girl named Jane meets the innocent ape and  both are transfigured. Through Haraway's lens, we see that the National  Geographic vision of Africa bears a stronger resemblance to Disney World than  to the African reality -- it is a theme park of the late 20th-Century  industrial West's imagination.  </P> <P> Haraway is chairman of the history of consciousness program at UC Santa Cruz,  and a leading figure in post-modern deconstructionism. "Primate Visions" is  about the way in which scientific accounts reflect and create our natural  cosmology. Haraway is at her best when she monkeys brilliantly with some of our  most precious symbols, at her worst when her language is inaccessible to a  layperson not steeped in post-modern criticism. This is an important book that  deserves the widest possible audience.  </P> <P> The first part of the book historically contextualizes the modern view of  primates. In a chapter entitled "Teddy Bear Patriarchy" we are led through the  great halls of the American Museum of Natural History. Here, Teddy Roosevelt's  patriarchal ideals of manhood are reflected in the African Hall dioramas in  which stuffed animals are mounted in family groupings to symbolize the "purity  of nature." African Hall was the work of Carl Akeley, the artist, scientist and  hunter who collected and stuffed African animals beginning in the 1880s. "From  the dead body of the primate Akeley crafted something finer than the living  organism; he achieved its true end, a new genesis. Decadence -- the threat of  the city, civilization, machine -- was stayed in the politics of eugenics and  the art of taxidermy."  </P> <P> The magnificent silverback male gorilla of which Haraway writes, was killed in  1921, the same year the museum hosted a large international gathering of  eugenicists. She connects the vision in the dioramas to the obsession with  "genetic hygiene" of many early 20th-Century Americans and Europeans. Like the  dioramas, eugenics contrasted the woes of civilization with the goodness of  nature. By showing us African Hall as "simultaneously a very strange place and  an ordinary experience for literally millions of North Americans" Haraway  points out how strange our ordinary reality is. No one who has read "Teddy Bear  Patriarchy" will ever experience a trip to the Museum of Natural History in  quite the same way as before.  </P> <P> Haraway devotes later chapters to modern primate field and laboratory studies.  She connects the portrayals of white women watching apes in the Third World to  First World anxieties about African decolonization. We read what is left out of  the National Geographic accounts: Jane Goodall and her mother making 2,000 Spam  sandwiches for Belgian troops fleeing their former colony; a cage constructed  for Goodall's son, to protect him from the chimpanzees. National Geographic  omits the African political context in which Goodall's work took place.  </P> <P> In a final section of the book, Haraway presents biographies of four modern  primatologists -- all of them women. It is probably not coincidental that  primatology is the only branch of evolutionary studies with a predominance of  successful women practitioners. Women are identified with nature and figure  importantly in the mythological construction of the primate Garden of Eden.  Women primatologists have contested male-centered origin stories by placing  female monkeys and apes center stage in their accounts, and emphasizing female  primate agency.  </P> <P> Because Haraway is interested in reading primatology as text, she avoids  questions about what is scientific fact versus poorly supported theoretical  speculation. One primatologist whose work Haraway discusses is a leading  proponent of sociobiology (the theory that animals and humans follow strategies  that insure that the greatest number of their own genes will survive in future  generations). The primatologist speaks of female monkeys, apes and humans as  competitive, assertive, dominance- oriented and looking out for their own  genetic advantage. It seems that female primates of the 1980s have taken their  places in the board room of primate troops that resemble corporate culture.  </P> <P> Haraway points out the ways in which this new image of female primates mirrors  late 20th-Century capitalist society. But sociobiology has been criticized for  its failure to document actual behavior across the primate life cycle. Because  a researcher seems to tell a good "feminist" story (i.e. that female primates  are strategists for their own genetic advantage) does not mean that the work is  good science. Sociobiology is genetic reductionism. It implies that gendered  behaviors are controlled by genes. There is much evidence that this is not the  case for humans, apes or monkeys. While all scientific stories may be read as  myth, some are also poor science.  </P> <P> Challenging and engaging, "Primate Visions" holds up a mirror to some of our  favorite myths about animals. It shows us that we are not innocent; a Sunday at  the museum or an evening in front of television are laden with meanings and  deep ambiguities at the heart of our ideas about human and animal.  </P></p>

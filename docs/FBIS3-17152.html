Novruz is the spring  festival. We have begun to mark this occasion after many years.  It indicates significant developments in the world.    Azerbaijan's people have achieved their freedom. Azerbaijan  is an independent republic. It has been recognized by the  United Nations and it has taken the place it deserves in that  organization. Novruz, which we have always marked, is [words  indistinct].    Meanwhile, we are celebrating Novruz in the middle of a  serious political situation. The Armenian Armed Forces have  attacked our Republic. Consequently, a large part of Azerbaijan  has been occupied. More than 1 million citizens have been  forced to leave their homes and become refugees. Our people are  prepared to fight to defend their homeland and its territory.  Our heroic sons and fighters have been martyred in violent  clashes while defending our homeland. On the eve of Novruz, I  wish to bow my head and remember our martyrs. I also wish to  assure our people that we shall always cherish the memory of our  martyrs.    A regrettable incident occurred in Baku yesterday. An  explosion destroyed a subway passenger car. Several passengers  were either killed or wounded. I convey my condolences to their  families. It seems that [words indistinct].    Meanwhile, the war is continuing. We are fighting to  liberate our territory. Our Armed Forces continue to retaliate  against the enemy attacks. They are taking measures to defend  our homeland. The fighting is of a frontal nature. Our people  have arisen to evict the enemy from their homeland. [passage  omitted]    The war has created a tragic situation for Azerbaijan's  people. More than 1 million citizens have been living under  difficult conditions. [passage indistinct]    I wish to ask our citizens, who have been forced to live  under miserable conditions after leaving their homes and  property, to be patient. They must rest assured that Azerbaijan  will definitely emerge from this state of affairs and that they  will return to their homes and places of birth. [passage on  Aliyev's reference to the importance of women and mothers and  Azerbaijanis living abroad omitted]    Azerbaijan has many important problems. However, the most  important of all is to create the conditions required to end the  war, maintain Azerbaijan's territorial integrity, establish  peace and tranquillity for the people, and enable each and every  citizen to benefit from the gains of our freedom and  independence. We regard those objectives as an obligation that  we have tried to fulfill and we will continue to do so. The  most urgent task is to end the war and maintain Azerbaijan's  independence. Our problems are common knowledge. We are trying  to [words indistinct]. The initiatives we have made in that  direction are common knowledge. The Armenian Armed Forces must  withdraw from the occupied territories. They must be removed  from Azerbaijan's territory and Azerbaijan's territorial  integrity must be maintained. We are holding talks on the basis  of those principles. We shall maintain the talks. The  negotiations will be held on the basis of the maintenance of  Azerbaijan's independence and its territorial integrity. I hope  that something will be achieved. The work carried out by the  international organizations and influential countries is very  important for us. We shall try to [words indistinct].    The Azerbaijan Armed Forces are [words indistinct] in the  defense of the Republic's territory. Everyone must rest assured  that we shall continue to work to strengthen the military forces  to guarantee Azerbaijan's independence and territorial  integrity. [passage indistinct]    If [words indistinct] fail, Azerbaijan's people and military  forces are capable of defending the homeland and maintaining its  territorial integrity. We shall achieve that objective. Our  people must rest assured that the grave situation will be  removed and Azerbaijan's occupied territories will be taken  back. They must rest assured that independent Azerbaijan will  [words indistinct] in the UN organization and the Republic's  people will achieve their objectives. Nothing can obstruct this  achievement. We shall try to resolve all the economic [words  indistinct] problems. We urge the Republic's people to work  together in that direction. [passage indistinct]    I appeal to our people and to all the political parties in  our society to unite to save our Republic and its people from  the difficult situation. [passage indistinct]    I hope that the very beautiful nature of Novruz will  strengthen the patriotic feeling and the spirit of unity in our  people. I also hope that our people will not spare any effort  in trying to improve the situation in the Republic.    I congratulate the Republic's citizens on the occasion of  Novruz once again. Esteemed sisters and brothers, I pray for  the happiness of each and every one of you. May you have  success in your life and work and may your festival be  auspicious. I wish you health and [words indistinct]. Thank  you.</p>

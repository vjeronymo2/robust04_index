			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Travel: A visit to the wild west of the far east - The way we were / Nicholas Woodsworth returns to Cambodia full of curiosity about his brother's life in Phnom Penh I HAD NOT seen my brother, Gregory, for some years when, for the first time since we lived there as children, I returned to Indochina. Like many people who grew up abroad, we have continued to lead the same life we began with. After tentative stabs at permanence, we both fell into a gipsy kind of existence, I into journalism, he into international aid. Over the years, we rarely found ourselves on the same continent. But, when our paths crossed, Gregory always had enthusiastic news of promotions, postings, moves up the career ladder. It came as a surprise, then, to learn some time ago that Greg had fallen in love, left his job at the UN in New York and, with no clear prospects in mind, moved to Cambodia. I was curious to see what kind of life he had found for himself in Phnom Penh. I might have been less so if he had taken up, say, with someone from Milton Keynes and become an accountant. But here he was, settled down with a French-Cambodian woman and helping her run a hotel for the Foreign Legion. It sounded as improbable and as curious as events in Cambodia itself. I had no greater idea of what to expect in the Cambodian capital than of the changes in my brother's life. When we left Indochina early in the 1960s, Cambodia was a Buddhist kingdom still ruled by a demi-god: an old, cultured country, hierarchical, mannered and ceremonial, authoritarian, admired nostalgically by the French civil servants who had administered it so recently. However, the bloom of centuries was mangled rapidly by the ideologies that colonialism engendered. Over the next three decades, one cataclysm followed another: a Vietnamese war that over-flowed its borders; a secret US bombing campaign to halt the spill; a right-wing political coup; invasion by US forces and their South Vietnamese allies; four years of social chaos and at least 1m lives lost to genocidal, Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge revolutionaries; invasion again and the installation of a Soviet-supported, Vietnamese-led regime; and 10 years of factional fighting which bled the country dry and has left it without effective government to this day. It is a familiar, endless litany of strategic super-power manoeuvring, regional economic opportunism and national political chicanery, a list of horrors that makes you wonder that there is anything left of Cambodia at all. I arrived in Phnom Penh at the beginning of Tet, the Chinese new year celebrated in south-east Asia wherever Chinese traders, and the communities that follow them, have settled. As I wheeled into town from the airport, crowds of Cambodians in their holiday best strolled the promenade alongside the wide and muddy Mekong river. Brides in long white dresses posed in parks for family albums. Bands of children set off firecrackers in places calculated to cause maximum mischief. The city was festive, vibrant, humming, a far cry from the ravaged image that two decades of Cambodian war reporting has left in our minds. From the back of a motorcycle taxi, Phnom Penh is a place that would have delighted Lewis Carroll. It appears to have decided that it lives in some upside-down, back-to-front universe. You do not simply drive in Phnom Penh. No matter what the situation, and at whatever speed is half-sanely possible, you merge. In Phnom Penh, intersections are challenges to be overcome, vigorously. Left and right are nominal notions. The only rule is that big gives way to small. Downtown, several hundred thousand motorcycles, cyclo-trishaws, bicycles, UN trucks, cars and 4 x 4s all work to a rhythm that is innovative, energetic and untrammeled by fixed procedure. It is a style that reflects the ethos of the entire city; surprisingly, it more or less works. Gregory lives not far from the river on a bumpy dirt road off the Monument d'Independence. It is a residential area of whitewashed villas; small, smoking, street-side piles of burning rubbish; palm and ornamental banana trees, and orchestras of lonely dogs that delight in barber-shop harmony at 3am. Sometimes there is the sound of small-arms fire at night. Gregory lives in the company of a small dog, a baby monkey named Lucy, a floating population of servants, their dependents and hangers-on - and Paulette. Paulette is dark, petite and pretty. She has a quick, white smile and a voice that changes mysteriously, and as rapidly as needed, from the liquid vowels of French to the short, chopped consonants of Khmer. She has the inner poise of the Asian and the European's spontaneous energy. After 20 years of life in the west, she has decided to give the Cambodian part of herself another chance. Gregory is not the first young man to be lured by the attractions of Cambodia. In the mid-1930s, a French military surgeon, having finished a tour of duty in Saigon, decided that he liked colonial life in the east and settled in Phnom Penh. He taught at the city's faculty of medicine, opened a branch of the Pasteur Institute and built a leprosarium. Among his patients was the young Prince Norodom Sihanouk, even then part-deified royalist and part-populist demagogue, the quirky leader upon whom the fate of Cambodia hangs so shakily today. In spite of his busy life, the good doctor eventually found time to marry a Cambodian wife and start a family which grew to include six children. Paulette was one of them. Educated in French schools in Phnom Penh, Gallic in taste and temperament, the doctor's family found life ever more difficult under the radical nationalisms that began tearing Cambodia apart in the 1960s. By the early 1970s, their father having died, the children began drifting away to studies, marriages and more stable lives in the west. By April 1975, when Phnom Penh surrendered to advancing battalions of the Khmer Rouge, only three of the children and the doctor's widow were left. She was lucky; she escaped the rural exodus and death in the killing fields by finding refuge in the French embassy. Few of the friends Paulette left behind in Cambodia are alive today. Talk to any number of Phnom-Penhois and you are unlikely to find one who is not a survivor of a horrifying family tragedy. Paulette's decision to remake her life in Cambodia has required not only a prospect of peace, however slim, but courage to overcome the memories of the past. Phnom Penh is a city of several faces. In the days that followed my arrival, Paulette showed me Khmer Phnom Penh - royal palaces of tapering spires and delicate gables curving skyward; temples and pagodas where, through the drifting smoke of joss sticks, the electric halos of gaudy plaster Buddhas blink on and off, and side streets teeming with noodle stalls, sidewalk barbers and motorcycle repairmen performing miracles with bits of scrap metal and wire. Paulette also showed me colonial Phnom Penh, the city of her own past: the arched porticoes of the Lycee Descartes where she studied; the art-deco facades of the Circle Sportif where she swam and played tennis; the mahogany-lined halls of the Hotel Royal, the most elegant Cambodian watering hole of its day. Now, much of colonial Phnom Penh is sad. The sienna walls of abandoned villas are covered with mould and lichen. Their jalousies are weather-beaten and open to the breeze, their gardens forsaken and gone to seed. For Paulette, it all evokes a special sadness. But the Khmer and colonial faces of the city are mere sideshows to Phnom Penh these days. They have all but disappeared beneath the big top thrown up by the biggest circus in town - the UN. If the 22,000-man, 8,000-vehicle, Dollars 2bn peace-keeping effort of the UN Transitional Authority in Cambodia, the largest operation of its type ever mounted, has failed to assert itself over the most crucial parts of the country - Khmer Rouge territory - it is indisputably present in Phnom Penh. I have difficulty imagining just how bad the Pol Pot years were. Even under the Vietnamese who replaced Pol Pot, Phnom Penh was a dismal and deprived place. Today, all that has changed. A wild west of the far east, the city is riding a booming, unregulated, dollar-propelled economic wave. One afternoon, Paulette took me to one of the two small hotels she has leased and manages in town. Pastis, Gauloises, card games of vingt-et-un, tired men in jungle fatigues talking about their work in paddy-fields - with eyes half closed, I might have been watching French Saigon in the 1950s. Paulette, though, is only one of tens of thousands of Phnom-Penhois who have found a living in the artificially-generated service economy. Visit some of the scores of other hotels, shops selling luxury goods, foreign car dealerships, bars, restaurants and dancing halls that have sprung up like mushrooms, and you will find that the UN has brought the whole world to the city. In the Pacific Hotel I watched a mountainous, bristly Bulgarian soldier wrestle a slip of a girl - one of the many Vietnamese who have flooded into the country for its quick and easy living - out of her chair and on to the dance floor for his own Balkan version of rock 'n' roll. In The Cathouse, favoured for its shorts-clad Filipino girls, I watched New Zealanders thrash Canadians at the pool table. In the No Problem Cafe, a villa of restored colonial elegance, I sipped the ultimate in UN-inspired cocktails: a house special of gin, blue curacao and lime known as la casque bleu (the blue helmet). Following two decades of hardship, Phnom Penh's quick prosperity seems something of a dream. In spite of the smoke-and-mirrors magic of the spending boom, there is little solid investment. No one knows what will become of Cambodia and Phnom Penh after the UN goes home. Everything is sold, nothing is made. Most new fixed investment is not Cambodian but ethnic Chinese. Profit on assets is calculated not in years but in months or weeks. Private and state corruption is endemic: government officials sell everything from official cars to the buildings in which they work. It makes Paulette sad. I asked her one evening why the country seems to have so little faith in itself or its future. 'Cambodians are a nation of survivors,' she told me. 'Under Pol Pot they learned to lie, to steal, to cheat. Day-to-day survival has become everything; when we see an opportunity today, we seize it before it goes. We live in impermanence and uncertainty.' Paulette dreams, one day, of opening a fine hotel on Cambodia's lush tropical coast. Greg imagines environmental protection on the Tonle Sap Lake, Asia's last great unspoiled wetland. Neither, however, believes an end to the country's problems lies just around the corner.</p>

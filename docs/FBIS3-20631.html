			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Beijing, 10 Sep, New China News Agency--(Reported by  reporter Liu Puquan)--Mr. Zhang Bofa, deputy mayor of Beijing,  disclosed today that China Petroleum and Natural Gas Company and  Beijing Metropolitan City will jointly build the  Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-to-Beijing Pipeline, now that the project  has been approved by the State Planning Commission. The pipeline  will supply natural gas to Beijing by the year 1997. This is an  important step China has taken to support Beijing's effort to  win the right to host the International Olympic Games in the  year 2000.    The pipeline from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas fields  to  Beijing will measure 800 kilometers in length and more than 600  centimeters in diameter. The pipeline runs through Shaanxi,  Shanxi, and Hobei provinces and passes through five river  crossings across the Huang He and 140 river crossings across  numerous smaller rivers. It crosses railroads in 20 places,  highways in 48 places and runs through complicated relief and  geological structures such as hilly areas, valleys, and gorges  and the loess plateau. The project will take three years to  complete. Work on the project is planned to commence during the  first half of 1994 and by the end of 1997 the conditions will be  there for the supply of natural gas to Beijing. Total  engineering investment is about 2.5 billion yuan. When Phase I  of the project is completed, the pipeline will be able to supply  about 1 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Beijing per year.    At the same time, Beijing will also start work on its  natural  gas supply, storage and usage facilities to synchronize with the  pipeline project. Total investment is about 1.5 billion yuan.    When Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia natural gas is made available to  Beijing by the pipeline, the natural gas will replace the  charcoal. It will reduce the number of residential fireplaces by  600,000 and the number of furnaces in public utilities and  industrial users by 40,000. This will improve greatly the  environmental conditions of Beijing and raise it to the level  and standards required by the World Health Organization.</p>

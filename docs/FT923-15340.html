			<p>920702 FT  02 JUL 92 / Letter: Charities should provide input in assessing top pay Sir, Why does the Top Salaries Review Body concentrate so much of its comparison research on directors' pay in private industry ('Political row may erupt over top people's pay', June 22)? There are other sectors of the economy where valid comparisons can be made with chief executives in local government and major charities. Our annual survey of the latter, based on 67 voluntary organisations, shows charity directors earning Pounds 36,500 in 1991 compared with chief executives in all sizes of private-sector companies on Pounds 45,000. In addition, only 55 per cent of the charities, compared with 84 per cent of companies, offered their chief executives a car. The relationship between a charity director and his trustees is in many ways similar to that of a permanent secretary and his minister and although the scale is different - even the Red Cross and the National Trust being dwarfed by the smaller ministries - input from some charities would seem relevant to the Top Salaries Review Body's work.

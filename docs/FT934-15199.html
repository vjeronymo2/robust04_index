			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Arts: A cool Russophile The pianist Nicholas Walker - early mid-30s, one might guess, and just starting to acquire a reputation - made his Wigmore Hall debut on Monday, with a boldly obscure but fervently Slav-oriented programme. The only non-Slavic composers, Beethoven and Liszt, were represented by inspirations from eastward: a polonaise and variations on a Russian dance from the one, arrangements of Russian songs from the other. But my real reason for going was that Walker is engaged in recording (for ASV) the complete piano oeuvre of Balakirev, including three pieces in this recital. Nobody else has 'done' Balakirev yet. My conviction is that among piano-composers Balakirev was a great minor master; and that a rediscovery of him, long overdue, should give unexpected pleasure to a lot of music-lovers. So, as a closet Balakirevite I have a keen interest in how his piano music may fare now. He wrote just as many - more than 40 - fine, undiscovered songs as well, but we shall have to wait; some of them require brilliant pianists too. It was Balakirev who established the 'Great Five', or 'Mighty Handful' of Russian nationalist composers: himself, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and the now-forgotten Cui. None of them had any formal Western training, but Balakirev had been a practical musician from his earliest years, long before Glinka made him his protege in St. Petersburg. His only piano teacher was a pupil of John Field (who invented the 'nocturne' before Chopin), and he learned the mid-19th century piano repertoire thoroughly - Hummel, Field, Schumann, Chopin, Liszt. From that, he developed his own fastidious, sparkling piano idiom, which demands strict digital clarity, a wide stretch and plenty of elan. Walker proved to be the nearest thing to a natural Balakirev performer that I have heard in a long while. When Western pianists go Slavophile, it is nearly always through seduction by Skryabin (Chopin carried to visionary extremes), Rakhmaninov (restless passion, sumptuous noise) or Prokofiev's grittily athletic sonatas. Except for the lusty Islamey, his only well-known piece, Balakirev was a world and almost a generation away from that. Walker's own programme-note called him 'a Russian cocktail of Chopin, Liszt and the Orient', but more could be said: his music is tidily intricate, poised and lucid, with an exotic scent but scarcely a superfluous note. Too often modern virtuosi deliver Islamey with heedless vulgarity, at grave cost to its best musical effects. Walker's heart and fingers were in very much the right place for Balakirev - roughly a century ago, with all the apposite period-finesse. Candid passion is not his forte: shorn of that, Rakhmaninov's op. 33 Etudes-Tableaux sounded like bleak, fascinating, experiments in the surreal. His Liszt and early Chopin were elegantly calculated, where a dose of extrovert charm would have been a useful bonus. In Walker's scrupulous Balakirev, however - the sixth Mazurka, the second Nocturne and a Glinka fantasy - we wanted no more than another degree or two of thrustful elan. He played the Mazurka so searchingly as almost to forget its essential lilt. On the forthcoming CDs, what will he make of the towering exuberance of the superb Sonata finale, the winsome glitter of the last Waltzes and the Tarantella, the racing chiaroscuro, the marvellous squib 'La Fileuse'? Given Walker's sympathetic strengths, and with no other competitors in the field, the question pleads for a happy answer.</p>

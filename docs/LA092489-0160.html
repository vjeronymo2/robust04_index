			<p><P> September 24, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SEYMOUR'S DECISION TO TURN PRO-CHOICE  </P> <P> In your editorial (Sept. 17) supporting Sen. John Seymour's reversal of his  position on abortion, you stated that Seymour recognizes that despite the  authority his public office provides, he does not have the power to impose his  personal and religious beliefs on everyone. Isn't this true of any issue in our  society?  </P> <P> No politician has the power to impose his or her personal or religious beliefs  on everyone, but to believe as you say in one thing and to support something  else is extremely difficult for me to understand.  </P> <P> If Sen. Seymour is personally opposed to abortion, I think he and the rest of  our society should stop blaming poor women for making our personal opinions one  thing and our public opinion something else.  </P> <P> ROY KEE  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Japan in construction talks JAPANESE officials yesterday made a last-minute attempt to avert sanctions which the US is threatening to impose on Japan unless it agrees to open its construction market in line with US demands. The chiefs of four of Japan's ministries concerned with the construction issue met yesterday in an effort to come up with a proposal that would reform key aspects of Japan's public works bidding system. At an emergency meeting yesterday evening, Mr Tsutomu Hata, foreign minister, Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary, Mr Kozo Igarashi, construction minister and Mr Kanju Sato, home affairs minister, discussed reforms which Japan could present to the US ahead of the November 1 deadline after which sanctions would be imposed. The four agreed that Japan needed to increase competitiveness and transparency in its bidding system. In a speech to US business executives on Wednesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, said that sanctions appeared to be 'the only way the Japanese will seriously address this issue'. The US has been threatening sanctions unless Japan reforms its public works bidding system in line with four principles outlined by the US to Japan: to introduce an open and competitive bidding system, to apply that system to all projects above a certain level, to strengthen anti-monopoly rules and to enhance data collection to assess progress in achieving those goals. Japanese officials refuse to accept the US deadline, which they claim was set unilaterally and without warning. However, there is a growing recognition that Japan will have to face up to international pressure to bring its bidding system in line with that of other industrialised countries. Mr Peter Sutherland, director-general of the Gatt, yesterday met leading Japanese politicians, including Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, but met with continued resistance to the idea of tarification of rice - turning quantitive restrictions into tariffs - from minister of agriculture, forestry and fisheries, Mr Eijiro Hata. The Japanese authorities are considering a number of proposals for the liberalisation of the rice market which would modify the Dunkel text proposal for tarification.</p>

			<p>920703 FT  03 JUL 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iranian oil minister attacks carbon tax plans A GRAVE warning of heightened political instability in the Middle East if 'carbon taxes' planned by several countries including the European Community were to get the go-ahead is to be given by Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's petroleum minister, in a speech today to delegates at a two-day ministerial conference here on energy. The carbon taxes would be imposed on fuels giving off emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas mainly responsible for the so-called greenhouse effect. Dr Subroto, secretary general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, yesterday rejected the rationale behind carbon tax proposals and called instead for the elimination of subsidies to coal producers and farmers. He also suggested that taxes be levied on chemicals used by 'We believe that the proposed tax is yet another form of excise tax intended to raise government receipts (from oil revenues) which, in some countries, are already more than three times the petroleum export revenues of the developing oil-producing countries,' Dr Subroto told conference delegates. The informal meetings, taking place at a heavily-guarded, secluded seaside resort outside the Norwegian west coast city of Bergen, are intended to promote a dialogue between oil producers and consumers. But they are not expected to yield any formal accords between the 25 countries represented. In a speech prepared for delivery today Mr Gholamreza calls for oil prices to double so that Middle East producers can regain their 1974 purchasing power, which he says will help ensure political stability in the region. He warns that a carbon tax - which he believes will lead to lower oil prices - will seriously affect producers' plans for meeting global demand through increased production. 'It will disrupt the market mechanism due to introduction of uncertainty. . . our trade relations will suffer. . . (and) most important of all our economic development and that of our future generations will be endangered.' 'Downward pressure on oil prices must come to an end at all costs if leaders of the industrial world want to have a realistic policy for long-term supply security,' the minister warns. With the greatest part of the world's oil and gas reserves belonging to Opec and the Gulf Mr Gholamreza stresses that these areas' political security is inseparable from the rest of the world's energy security. 'Ever since 1975, oil producers' real income has drastically decreased due to industrial states' policies. This poverty threatens the oil producers' political stability.' Mr Gholamreza questions whether consumers have benefitted from lower oil prices or if oil products actually reached them at higher prices because of to heavy taxation. He supports his argument by pointing out that the six leading industrial nations, through taxes, are at present earning twice the petroleum revenue of the six main Opec producers. Mr Guiseppe Guarino, Italy's industry minister, called yesterday in Bergen for environmetal concerns to be taken into account more fully in consideration of energy policy. He urged a reassessment of the contribution of non-traditional energy sources and in particular nuclear energy. 'The present (energy) workshop can be a great success if we will be able to go from declarations of principles to concrete actions,' he said. This could be achieved by a fresh approach to the relations between producer and consumer nations. The minister added that amendments to the Iinternational Energy Agency statutues might have to be considered to enable it to play a constructive role in reconciling security of energy supply with protection of the environment. 'This broader vision requires an institutional forum where the much needed initiatives can be developed and become a reality,' he told delegates.</p>

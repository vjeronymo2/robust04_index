			<p>920415 FT  15 APR 92 / Bid for Midland: HSBC tax shift to cost Pounds 200m HSBC HOLDINGS, the London holding company of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's worldwide assets, will incur an unexpected Pounds 200m (Dollars 344m) provision against additional tax charges by becoming UK resident for tax purposes after the takeover of the Midland Bank, it was disclosed yesterday. The change of tax status has been carefully planned to ensure that taxpayers outside the UK will not suffer reduced dividends. Mr William Purves, HSBC chairman, said that he expected that the impact of higher UK corporate taxation on the London-registered holding company would be neutral by the third year after the takeover. HSBC is already incorporated in the UK, but is currently non-resident for UK tax purposes as it is still substantially managed from Hong Kong. That may change on January 1 1993, with the relocation of 'appropriate group functions' - including the chairman's office  - to the UK. A number of HSBC subsidiaries already pay UK corporation tax - or the rate applicable in the country in which they operate. Dividends to the holding company, which are presently taxed at local rates, will now be liable at the UK level. The Hong Kong corporate tax rate is being raised by 1 per cent to 17.5 per cent, but remains mild compared with the UK rate of 33 per cent. Mr Purves said the Pounds 200m provision was conservative and he expected no additional tax burden for the enlarged group. UK corporation tax is payable on dividends from non-UK subsidiaries of HSBC. These would be transferred in order to pay the holding company's own dividends. UK tax would also be incurred on capital gains registered by HSBC. Mr Purves said: 'There are many sources from which we can pay HSBC Holdings dividends, without cleaning out its own subsidiaries.' That will depend largely on the performance of the non-Hong Kong operations. In 1991, out of HSBC's HKDollars 12.8bn fully disclosed profit before tax, HKDollars 11.1bn was generated in Hong Kong, which has no double taxation treaty with the UK. A substantial pick-up in earnings from Midland and Marine Midland, HSBC's US banking subsidiary, would neutralise the impact of UK taxation; the US has a double taxation treaty, while there will be no change in Midland's own tax treatment.</p>

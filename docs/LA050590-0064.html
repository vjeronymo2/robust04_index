			<p><P> May 5, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REVIEW ATTACKS YOUTH  </P> <P> Randy Lewis' article on comedians Sam Kinison and Andrew (Dice) Clay ("Hate  Mongers Are a Bad Chapter in the History of Comedy," April 22) was an  opinionated, narrow-minded, malicious attack on not only these comedians but  also the youth of America.  </P> <P> Just because he doesn't like their style of comedy, that does not give him the  right to condemn those who do.  </P> <P> The young people of America are not "imbecilic" or "easily brainwashed" into  following a persona (as the older generation was when they supported Reagan's  supply-side economics). We are just into something else, something different.  Every generation is different from the next; it's been like that in the past  and will continue to be like that in the future!  </P> <P> So, Mr. Lewis, I am sorry if my generation does not idolize your Woody Allen or  Lenny Bruce (as you would like). But you cannot ignore change or "pray that it  will go away," because it will not (whether you like it or not).  </P> <P> MICHAEL GRUBBS, Fullerton  </P></p>

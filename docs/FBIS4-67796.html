			<p>CSO     [Text] Chandipur-on-sea, Feb. 19 (UNI)--India's  intermediate range ballistic missile Agni was successfully  test-fired from the Interim Test Range (ITR) here on Saturday  evening.    Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) sources  said unlike on 7 January, when it had to be postponed owing to a  snag in the on-board computer system, Saturday's blast-off was  flawless.    However, while the tentative schedule for the blast-off was  fixed between 7 and 5 p.m., it actually took off at 5.45 p.m.    Agni, which has a range of 2,500 km, is one of the five  missiles developed under the Integrated Guided Missile  Development Programme. The others being Prithvi, Akash, Trishul  and Nag.    A network of telemetry and tracking stations at the ITR, the  Sriharikota High Altitude Range (SHAR), Car Nicobar and naval  ships followed the flight sequence throughout till the payload  impacted at the designated target. The white hot object was  tracked by the naval ships confirming the success of the mission.    The third launch of the test-vehicle was aimed at achieving  longer range and advanced manoeuvrability during the re-entry  phase of the flight for greater accuracy in guiding the payload  to a designated target at long range.    The missile used a solid propellant in the first stage and a  liquid propellant in the second stage and was fully indigenous.  It is 21 metres in length with a take off weight of 19 tonnes  and a payload capacity of one tonne.    There were no problems with the direction (azimuth) of the  missile. Also the missile firing was stable and could do the  critical pitch over manoeuvre--when the missile is fired in a  vertical position and at a certain height it is deflected about  20-25 degrees during the first stage to put the missile into its  designated flight path.</p>

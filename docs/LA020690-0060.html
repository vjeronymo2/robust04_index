			<p><P> February 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY POSTS SLUGGISH 0.9% RISE  </P> <P> American workers' productivity rose just 0.9% last year -- the worst showing  since the 1981-82 recession -- while hourly labor costs sped upward, the  government said Monday.  </P> <P> The Labor Department said the 0.9% increase in non-farm productivity -- defined  as output per hour of work -- was less than half of the 2% gain recorded in  1988.  </P> <P> While blaming part of last year's poor performance on an overall slowdown in  economic growth, analysts worried that the combination of weak productivity  growth and rising labor costs would further weaken America's ability to compete  internationally.  </P> <P> "That's a recipe for trouble," said Allen Sinai, chief economist for Boston Co.  "It's very distressing. . . . It's symptomatic of an economy that is near the  end of expansion."  </P> <P> The report showed that while productivity was slumping, hourly labor costs -- a  major inflation measure for businesses -- escalated significantly, jumping  5.5%, up from the 4.7% rise of 1988 and the biggest increase since 1982.  </P> <P> "Labor cost increases are probably the scariest part of the report," said David  Wyss, chief economist at DRI-McGraw Hill.  </P> <P> For the October-through-December quarter, non-farm productivity rose a barely  perceptible 0.2%, the report said. Hourly labor costs rose at an annual rate of  6.9% in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> Output in the non-farm sector was up 3.3% in 1989, while the number of hours  worked rose by 2.4%, giving the 0.9% increase in productivity.  </P> <P> The report was certain to revive the debate over America's lagging  productivity.  </P> <P> Since the end of the 1981-82 recession, productivity growth has averaged 1.8% a  year. While a slight improvement over the 1.2% average growth rate in the  1970s, it was still far below the 3.3% rate of increase posted in the two  decades after World War II, when American workers enjoyed healthy wage gains  and a rising standard of living.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PRODUCTIVITY  </P> <P> Non-farm business productivity, percent change from previous quarter,  seasonally adjusted annual rate. 1988: 1st quarter: +2.8. 2nd quarter: -1.6.  3rd quarter: +3.3. 4th quarter: +1.9.1989: 1st quarter: -1.3. 2nd quarter:  +1.1. 3rd quarter: +2.4. 4th quarter: +0.2.  </P> <P> Source: Labor Department  </P></p>

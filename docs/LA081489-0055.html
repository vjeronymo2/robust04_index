			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> METS FINALLY BACKING WORDS WITH VICTORIES  </P> <P> Several times this season, the New York Mets have indicated they were ready to  take command of the East.  </P> <P> Each time they fell back, seemingly content to let the Chicago Cubs and  Montreal Expos dominate the division.  </P> <P> It now appears the Mets are ready to prove what they have been saying all along  -- that they are the class of the league.  </P> <P> During the weekend, the Mets didn't merely put a deep dent in the hopes of the  St. Louis Cardinals, they served notice they are beginning to live up to  expectations.  </P> <P> Bob Ojeda, in winning his fourth in a row, made it into the eighth inning  Sunday at New York and the Mets outlasted the Cardinals, 3-2.  </P> <P> In winning four of the five against their bitter division rival, the Mets moved  to within 3 1/2 games of the first place Cubs.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, who barely missed pulling out victories in the last two games,  are 6 1/2 back.  </P> <P> With the bases loaded in the eighth inning and St. Louis trailing by a run, the  Cardinals' Jose Oquendo hit a slow roller off Randy Myers toward second. Tim  Teufel, not noted for stellar defensive play, made a barehanded pickup and his  throw barely beat Oquendo. If Oquendo, a switch-hitter, had been batting from  the left side, he probably would have beaten it out and tied the score.  </P> <P> Ojeda (9-9) has a 1.88 earned-run average in his last six starts, while the  staff in its last 14 games has a 1.74 ERA.  </P> <P> The Mets are 40-19 at Shea Stadium but 10 games below .500 on the road.  </P> <P> The Cardinals' Vince Coleman stole two bases and is now 52 for 52 against the  Mets.  </P> <P> Howard Johnson, the Mets' offensive leader, sat out the second game in a row  because of a bruised shoulder.  </P> <P> Philadelphia 5, Chicago 3 -- The Cubs' strategy was to pitch around Von Hayes  and John Kruk in this game at Chicago.  </P> <P> But Ricky Jordan foiled the best laid plans of Manager Don Zimmer. Jordan  tripled in two runs in the first inning, then hit a sacrifice fly to break a  tie in the eighth inning and give the Phillies a split in the four-game series.  </P> <P> "Now I see the ball better and I'm more confident," said Jordan, who has driven  in 14 runs in the last 15 games. "Earlier it frustrated me when they pitched  around the other guys to get to me."  </P> <P> One Cub streak ended. Ryne Sandberg, after resting a game, went 0 for 3 after  hitting home runs in five consecutive games. But Jerome Walton doubled in the  fifth inning to extend his hitting streak to 24 games, longest in the majors  this season.  </P> <P> Walton crashed into the left-field fence in the sixth inning trying to catch  Hayes' deep drive, which went for an inside-the-park home run. Walton suffered  a bruised shoulder and left after one more inning.  </P> <P> Cincinnati 5, Houston 0 -- The way he pitches against the Astros, left-hander  Tom Browning looks as good as any pitcher in the league.  </P> <P> Although he gave up six hits and walked five at Houston, Browning breezed to  his eighth victory in a row over the Astros.  </P> <P> In his previous game against the Astros, the Reds scored 14 runs in the first  inning for Browning and won, 18-2.  </P> <P> "I've had some good breaks," Browning said. "It is much easier to pitch when  you have some runs to work with. The Astros are an aggressive team and I won't  give them the same pitch in the same spot twice."  </P> <P> The Astros, who have lost four of their last five and eight out of 11, missed a  chance to gain ground on the San Francisco Giants in the West. They remained  three games behind.  </P> <P> Browning has won 23 of his last 26 decisions against teams in the West.  </P> <P> Pittsburgh 6, Montreal 4 -- Bob Walk, with last-inning help from Bill Landrum  at Montreal, improved to 10-7 and ended the Pirates' three-game losing streak.  </P> <P> The Pirates' Andy Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla hit consecutive home runs in the  seventh inning.  </P> <P> Pascual Perez (6-12), mostly a disappointment this season, lost for the third  time in the last four games. He gave up seven hits in 6 2/3 innings. DAN HAFNER  </P></p>

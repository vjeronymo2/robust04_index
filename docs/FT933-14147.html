			<p>930715 FT  15 JUL 93 / International Company News: Federal Express shares soar as profits rise 56% in fourth term SHARES in Federal Express jumped yesterday morning after the US's biggest overnight delivery company unveiled a 56 per cent increase in fourth-quarter profits, reflecting reduced international losses. At the market's close, shares in the Memphis-based company were up Dollars 6 1/2 at Dollars 53 3/8 after a delayed opening following the earnings release after Wall Street's close on Tuesday. The company said it was talking to Lufthansa, the German airline, about buying passenger aircraft to be converted to freighters in a deal that could be worth about Dollars 400m. For the three months to May 31, Fedex posted net income of Dollars 55.8m, or Dollars 1.01 a share, compared with Dollars 35.8m, or 66 cents, a year earlier. Revenues rose 8 per cent in the last quarter of fiscal 1993 to Dollars 2.04bn from Dollars 1.89bn the previous year. Operating income in the quarter rose 24 per cent to Dollars 136.5m from Dollars 109.8m. In the latest quarter, the international business showed some improvement. Operating losses narrowed to Dollars 25.4m on revenues of Dollars 539.2m from an operating deficit of Dollars 53.2m on revenues of Dollars 536.1m a year ago. Mr Alan Graf, chief financial officer, expects international operations to break even by fiscal 1995 or earlier. For the full year, Fedex had net income of Dollars 53.9m, or 98 cents, compared with a loss of Dollars 113.8m, or Dollars 2.11, the previous year. Results were distorted by one-time charges in both years, including the adoption of new accounting standards in fiscal 1993 and a pre-tax Dollars 254m charge for restructuring. Stripping out extraordinary items, the company earned Dollars 109.8m, or Dollars 2.01, in fiscal 1993, against Dollars 54.7m, or Dollars 1.01, a year earlier. Revenues rose to Dollars 7.81bn from Dollars 7.55bn. In the US, the average price per package fell faster than costs, contributing in a decline in domestic underlying operating income to Dollars 559.2m from Dollars 635.9m a year ago.</p>

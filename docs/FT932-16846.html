			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / Letter: Complexities that endanger financial regulatory structure Sir, Re 'Study of finance regulators urged' (March 26), Taurus toppled because, among other things, of the weight of sheer complexity; now the financial regulatory organisations are in danger of suffering the same fate. The organisations were established with the ultimate and simple objective of protecting clients. In the wake of recent scandals, their role of protection is expanding into the diverse requirements of compliance. This has resulted in their proactive role in management functions. The rationale for regulation is clear, but the process is having a debilitating effect on the management of financial companies. The worry is that the regulatory structure will collapse under the complexity of compliance, leaving not only a regulatory vacuum but also an industry that has lost its competitive edge.

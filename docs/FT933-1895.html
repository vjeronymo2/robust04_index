			<p>930922 FT  22 SEP 93 / Salinas brushes up Mexico's polls image: A look at attempts to take the controversy out of elections PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas, who assumed power under a cloud of allegations of electoral fraud, has made a last effort to dispel criticisms of Mexico's political system and prepare the way for a clean and trouble-free presidential ballot next year. Last week, at his behest, Congress passed electoral laws that will set the first-ever ceilings on campaign contributions, give independent electoral observers formal status, make the electoral institutes more independent of the government and regulate access to the media by the political parties. The reforms are the last electoral changes before next August's presidential ballot, in which President Salinas is barred from standing by the constitution. They were passed by overwhelming majorities in both houses of Congress after the government had made last-minute concessions to the conservative National Action party (PAN), which had opposed the laws. However, the reforms drew fire from the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD), which has fought for more profound political changes and abstained from voting. The PRD, like many independent observers, charged that the new laws would do little to loosen the Institutional Revolutionary party's 64-year grip on power. Under the new laws, the supposedly non-partisan Federal Electoral Institute (IFE) remains answerable to the interior ministry and will have the power to set the limits on campaign spending. Next year, individual contributions to a party will be limited to the equivalent of about Dollars 650,000 (Pounds 422,000) while associations will be allowed to give about five times that amount. Such generous limits will work in favour of the PRI, which has close ties with most of Mexico's wealthy businessmen. While regulation of access to the media will ensure there is no formal discrimination against the opposition buying advertisements, there is no sign yet that the favourable light in which the government is treated on all television networks will change. The new owner of Mexico's recently privatised television networks has expressed his admiration for President Salinas. In doing so, he is following the pro-government line that has helped make Televisa, the main television network, one of Mexico's most profitable companies and Latin America's largest media concern. The changes come after the government, among other measures, last month agreed to double the number of Senate seats and, in a modest concession to PAN, to permit the child of a foreign-born Mexican parent to be eligible for the presidency. This latter reform will not take effect until 1999, so that the PAN's most popular candidate, Mr Vicente Fox, who has a Spanish-born parent, will not be able to run in next year's election. President Salinas hailed the new laws as creating conditions for 'civil' elections and reducing the 'perspective of tension'. Put together with the changes passed earlier in his term, which included the drawing up of an accurate electoral roll, they make a repetition of the 1988 election, when fraud was widely reported, less likely. Protests which followed that election and others, and complaints at massive spending by the PRI and its control of much of the media, undercut the PRI's legitimacy. This has become one of the side-issues surrounding the North American Free Trade Agreement. Several US congressmen have voiced concern about lack of democracy in Mexico and the issue is likely to be raised in congressional hearings on the trade deal later this year. However, with the PRD opposing the reforms and the PAN in two minds about their merits, it is not certain that the laws will fulfil their function of making Mexico's elections fully credible. While the government has brushed aside the PRD's opposition to the reforms, its candidate in next year's election, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, is expected to be the most serious threat to the PRI, as he was in 1988.</p>

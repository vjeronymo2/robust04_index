			<p><P> September 21, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> 5 S.C. LEGISLATORS, LOBBYIST CHARGED IN BRIBERY SCANDAL  </P> <P> Five more representatives and a lobbyist were charged today in South Carolina's  growing bribery scandal.  </P> <P> Republican Thomas Limehouse and Democrats Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding, B. J.  Gordon and Donna A. Moss were named in a federal indictment growing from the  FBI sting into the state Legislature.  </P> <P> Limehouse was charged in a three-count indictment of two violations of the  Hobbs Act, the federal anti-bribery law, for allegedly accepting $2,000,  conspiracy to accept cash and an additional obstruction of justice charge.  </P> <P> Fant, Blanding and Gordon were charged together in one count of conspiracy to  violate the Hobbs Act. Fant was also charged with accepting two bribes of  $1,300; Blanding was charged with accepting two bribes of $1,300; and Gordon  was charged with accepting one bribe for $1,000.  </P> <P> Moss was charged with possession of cocaine during the 1989 Legislative  session.  </P> <P> Also charged was lobbyist James Madison Brown V, on one count of possession of  marijuana in September, 1989.  </P> <P> The indictments have come as the result of an FBI sting, nicknamed "Operation  Lost Trust," which probed vote-buying in the General Assembly. Of five other  legislators charged last month, three have pleaded guilty and another is  expected to plead guilty next week.  </P> <P> Several black legislators and activists have suggested the investigation is  racially biased, if not racially motivated.  </P> <P> Three of the five legislators charged today -- Fant, Blanding and Gordon -- are  black, as is one of the five charged last month, Luther Taylor. In all, there  are 19 blacks in South Carolina's House and Senate.  </P> <P> U.S. Atty. Bart Daniel and other prosecutors have repeatedly insisted the  investigation had no racial bias or motivation, and virtually all the state's  white political leaders have said they do not see a racial bias.  </P></p>

And the South  Korean Christian Broadcasting System (CBS) reported that Han  Sung-chu would meet with U.S. masters to "readjust" the stand  of both sides and discuss the socalled "follow-up measures"  pursuant to the "resolution" of the International Atomic Energy  Agency.    Commenting on this, papers here today say this suggests that  the South Korean puppets will seek international "pressure" and  "sanctions" against the fellow countrymen in the North in league  with outside forces at whatever costs.    An analyst of NODONG SINMUN says:    The South Korean puppets have neither qualification nor face  to run about with the "nuclear issue" of the North.    It is imprudent, ridiculous and shameless that the very ones  creating nuclear threats on the Korean peninsula are crying over  the "nuclear issue" of the North. This reminds people of a  thief crying "stop thief".    It is clear that the South Korean puppets are trying to put  a  spoke in the wheel of the third round of the DPRK-USA talks  aimed at solving the nuclear issue and do harm to the fellow  countrymen in the North in league with the outside forces.    Such malicious act can be committed only by traitors who are  dyed to the marrow with flunkeyism and treachery.    The reality proves that with traitors such as Kim Yong-sam  and Han Sung-chu left alone, neither reunification nor peace of  the country can be achieved. If the puppets, together with the  outside forces, seek to slay fellow countrymen in defiance of  the desire of the nation, it will result in precipitating their  self-destruction.</p>

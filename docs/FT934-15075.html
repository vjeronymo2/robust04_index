			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading ACTIVE options trading was in sharp contrast to a a dull session in FT-SE futures, writes Christine Buckley. Muted speculation of a cut today in interest rates failed to excite Footsie futures. The rate cut rumour, which gripped short sterling trading especially, made no waves outside fixed income markets and futures seemed largely locked in a pre-Budget paralysis. Large investors were said to have kept their distance. With no stimulus on offer from other European markets the December contract on the FT-SE 100 sailed listlessly downstream, mostly trading at fair value, which stands at 21 points. Even a bouncy opening was not all it appeared and the contract's short climb in early trading was partly down to investors rectifying positions from the previous day when there had been a substantial amount of after-hours selling. December's high point of the day - at 3,142 - was quickly lost and the pattern was downward for most of the session. A small rally was mustered after the post-lunchtime low of 3,112 and the contract was picked up to close at 3,120 - just over 3 points in front of its fair value premium to the cash market. Index options showed life as sights are set on the year end and there is more hedging of positions. The option on the FT-SE 100 traded 20,874 lots while the Euro FT-SE saw business in 4,419 lots.</p>

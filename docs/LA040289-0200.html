			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWS BRIEFS: SHIPSHAPE LIFE STYLE  </P> <P> New York City is getting a "dockominium" with 26 watery parking spaces that  will be priced from $600,000 to $2 million each.  </P> <P> The spaces are at North Cove Yacht Harbor, a 3.75-acre man-made cove off the  Hudson River. North Cove is a U-shaped notch in Manhattan's Battery Park City,  a community of office towers and apartment buildings constructed on landfill.  </P> <P> Scheduled to open in June, the harbor will accommodate yachts at least 100 feet  long and will have electrical, telephone and cable television connections,  fresh water, sewage collection and concierge service.  </P> <P> Until condominium plans are approved by the state, slips will be leased for  seven-year periods. The longest, 155 feet, will cost about $1.6 million over  seven years. The shortest, 80 feet, will lease for $565,000. The rates have  been described as two or three times higher than those charged at the area's  other leading marinas.  </P> <P> John Gavin, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico and chairman of the company  building the marina, said the public will be allowed to get up close to the  yachts. There will be security, but there will be no gates or fences.  </P> <P> The rich don't resent such intrusion in the Mediterranean, he added.  </P></p>

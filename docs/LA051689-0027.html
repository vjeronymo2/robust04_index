			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: JAZZ  </P> <P> A team of elderly Chinese jazzmen who stopped playing their favorite music for  30 years after their country's communist revolution will be honored guests at  the 16th Sacramento Dixieland Jubilee, May 26-29. Members of the Peace Hotel  Old Jazz Band played in Shanghai before the 1949 revolution, having learned  jazz by listening to Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller records, and from the few  American bands that visited China. The Chinese group will be one of 15 foreign  bands playing at the Sacramento jazz show, which began with 21 jazz groups and  8,000 visitors when it was launched in 1974. Last year it drew more than 100  musical groups and 110,000 paying guests. The four-day show goes on at seven  sites, four in central Sacramento and three in outlying areas. The Soviet  Union's Leningrad Dixieland Ensemble is also due to perform. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

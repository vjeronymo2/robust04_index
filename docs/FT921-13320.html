			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Capital Markets: Raised voices on the Frankfurt exchange - Plans to run the open-outcry system and electronic trading in tandem THE Frankfurt Stock Exchange, the largest in Germany, has decided it will not immediately abolish floor trading in Germany's most liquid stocks when it moves to a computerised trading - at an as yet indefinite date in the mid-1990s. Instead, the existing open-outcry system will be able to continue in tandem with the new electronic system. This decision, taken at a meeting of the board of the exchange earlier this week, goes against one of the main recommendations of an unpublished report into electronic trading, prepared for the exchange by the McKinsey consulting firm. Despite the decision not to follow McKinsey's advice on this point, the implications for the German securities market, and those who prosper under present arrangements, are profound. At present, approximately 80 per cent of domestic business in the shares in the Dax 30 index is handled by Freie Makler - official brokers who derive commission, or courtage - from matching bargains on the open outcry Amtliche Handel - official market - which is open from 10.30am to 1.30pm on weekdays. Commission currently stands at 0.06 per cent of transaction value. The remaining 20 per cent of DAX 30 business is handled on Ibis, an electronic system which started in December 1989 as an information exchange, but in April last year was upgraded to handle trading in DAX 30 shares and some leading bond issues. While Ibis has increasingly gained acceptance among financial institutions executing business in Germany, it is seen by the Frankfurt exchange as limited in terms of the restricted number of securities which can be traded, and its user base. Hence the determination to entertain a move to a fully electronic market. McKinsey will present an updated draft of its report to the exchange in March. The following month, the exchange will take a final decision on how to proceed. According to the draft report, the new system will be organised on the auction principle - with buy and sell orders collected together and prices fixed at intervals. This is in contrast to the London Stock Exchange's price-driven system Seaq (Stock Exchange Automated Quotation). The plan is to start with the top 30 shares and the top 30 bond issues at some stage in the next two years, before moving on to handle all 650 stocks and 15,000 bond issues. Prices for the most highly-traded shares will be set as often as every minute; for the two less liquid tiers, prices will be fixed once or twice a day. include the Deutsche TerminBorse - Germany's electronic futures and options market which opened in January 1990 - and the systems used by the Stockholm and Vancouver exchanges. The Frankfurt exchange claims the three main benefits of a move to full electronic trading are lower transaction costs, greater transparency of the market and greater liquidity. These aims accord well with the statements of principle advanced last week by Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, and Chancellor Kohl when he visited Frankfurt on Monday. The politicians are keen to strengthen Finanzplatz Deutschland - Germany as a financial centre - and full electronic trading is deemed by Frankfurt to be a step in this direction. The Maklers - who number around 400, including those who make prices on the secondary Geregelter Markt for less liquid stocks - protested loudly last week when the first hints of the McKinsey proposals appeared in the local press. They have won a victory of sorts in that their role is not going to abolished overnight, as McKinsey proposed. But in the long term they will have to prove themselves highly adaptable when competing with the electronic system - or they will disappear altogether.

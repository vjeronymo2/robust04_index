			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Nick Bezuidenhout] </F>   [Text] Mercenaries serving in the controversial company  Executive Outcomes have reportedly been threatened with death  should they "speak out" about the war they are conducting with  the Angolan MPLA [Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]  government against the rebel group, UNITA [National Union for  the Total Independence of Angola]. The men, mostly former  soldiers of the South African Defense Force or former members of  Koevoet [Crowbar; Namibia police counterinsurgency unit],  returned to South Africa at the beginning of this year when they  found they were not only supposed to train Angolan soldiers, but  also fight against UNITA. The operation in Angola is believed to  be under the command of former members of the Civil Cooperation  Bureau [CCB].    Executive Outcomes is alleged to be hiring former South  African soldiers under the pretext of training soldiers in  Angola and guarding the oil refineries. They receive salaries  of between 7,300 and 14,000 rands, paid in U.S. dollars.    Eben Barlow, Nico Palm, and Lafras Luitingh are among the  people running Executive Outcomes. Mr. Barlow is the director,  and Mr. Palm is the financial manager. Mr. Luitingh, former CCB  member, was the "handler" of Mr. Ferdi Barnard, a former CCB  member accused of having killed human rights activist, David  Webster.    Reliable sources have disclosed to BEELD that the men  employed by Executive Outcomes heard at the beginning of January  that they had to fight against UNITA as well. A group of about  20 refused to carry out the instruction and were sent back to  South Africa. Another group was also sent back about three weeks  later because they had also refused.    It is also alleged they were told that they would be  "eliminated in a natural manner" should they talk about what is  going on in Angola.    A Namibian newspaper reports that UNITA itself had said that  it had shot dead 12 South African mercenaries. One of them was  Lieutenant Steyn Marais, who had grown up in Namibia and served  five years in the South African Defense Force's reconnaissance  commando.</p>

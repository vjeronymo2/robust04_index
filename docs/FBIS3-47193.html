			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 7 Jan 94 Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] Regarding the question of liberalizing the cellular  phone market -- an issue of concern to Japan and the United  States -- the government has confirmed the position that it will  not take any new administrative measures to promote  participation of U.S.-model products in the Japanese market.  The government is expected to formally notify the United States  of this position in an urgent vice-ministerial-level meeting it  has called to hold in Washington early next week. The United  States has called on Japan to open up its cellular market  further, by setting 15 February as the date by which it will  decide whether to take retaliatory measures, but Japan is poised  to maintain the position of insisting "this is an issue which  should be resolved by the private sector."    With the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks going into  full-  scale negotiations soon, the government hopes the confirmation  of this basic stance can remind the United States on the  principle of the economic talks that "measures should be limited  to those which the hands of government can reach." Meanwhile,  most likely, the United States will insist that measures should  be instituted at the government level. The issue of cellular  phones is not a topic of discussion at the economic framework  talks. However, this issue is likely to loom large when trying  to predict what will happen to the framework talks henceforth.    A Japan-U.S. vice-ministerial-level meeting on cellular  phones has been requested by Japan, and negotiations are now  underway toward holding it on 10 or 11 January. Masahito Tani,  deputy vice-minister of posts and telecommunications, and  Charlene Barshevsky, vice U.S. trade representative, are  expected to attend the meeting, representing Japan and the  United States, respectively.    In December, the U.S. Government announced that it was  moving  up the deadline for deciding on retaliatory measures from the  end of March to 15 February 1994, on the grounds that the  adoption of Motorola systems in the Japanese market is lagging  as compared to that of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT)  systems. The United States appears to be wanting to extract  concessions from Japan by associating this issue with the  economic framework talks which Japan and the United States want  to conclude in a summit on 11 February.    Japan insists, "The Motorola systems have been used in the  metropolitan area and the central region since 1989. Enough  frequencies have been assigned to them already." A source in  the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "There is nothing more  that can be done at the government level." In the  vice-ministerial-level meeting expected to be held early next  week, Japan will ask the United States why it has moved up the  deadline for deciding on retaliatory measures, and will make  clear its position that "whether or not the Motorola systems  should be adopted is a question to be dealt with at the  private-sector level."</p>

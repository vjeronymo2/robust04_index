			<p>Language: <F P=105> Persian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry of the Islamic Republic of Iran  strongly condemns the attack by the Serbs on the market in  Sarajevo. In a statement it describes the attack as a sign of  the continuing inhumane and terrorist crime of the Serbs against  the people of Sarajevo. The statement refers to the non-use of  force by the United Nations in attempting to establish peace and  security in Bosnia-Herzegovina as giving the Serbs a free hand  in the genocide of Muslims.    The Iranian Foreign Ministry statement reaffirms the need  for  the United Nations to rapidly intervene in order to stop the  merciless massacre of the people in Bosnia, and calls for an end  to the arms embargo imposed on the defenseless people of Bosnia.  The Foreign Ministry statement describes the negligence by the  Security Council and the UN secretary general as a violation of  the principles and objectives of the United Nations, and an  insult to world public opinion.    Our country's Foreign Ministry statement continues: The  Islamic Republic of Iran once again announces its readiness to  send peacekeeping forces, under the supervision of the United  Nations, to Bosnia-Herzegovina, as a step that would help to end  the genocide in Bosnia. The Islamic Republic of Iran regards  the failure of the Security Council to make an urgent decision  on Bosnia as dangerous for the honor and standing of the United  Nations, the spirituality of the human race [as heard], and  peaceful coexistence in international relations.    Our country's foreign minister spoke to our correspondent  today. He called for the swift action of international circles  in order to put an end to the massacre of civilians in Bosnia.</p>

			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAIDER BID DOESN'T DEPEND ON BROWNS  </P> <P> Despite the NFL's previous explanation, the Raiders do not need a loss by the  Cleveland Browns to make the playoffs.  </P> <P> There are other scenarios possible. However, all depend on the Raiders beating  the New York Giants Sunday at the Meadowlands.  </P> <P> For instance, if the Raiders win and Indianapolis loses at New Orleans Sunday  and Cincinnati loses at Minnesota Monday night, the Raiders would be in.  </P> <P> Thus no matter what happens in Saturday night's Browns-Oilers game at Houston,  the Raiders will be alive Sunday.

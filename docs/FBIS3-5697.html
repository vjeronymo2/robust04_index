This is the first political-diplomatic  contact at the highest level after the establishment in March  1990 of diplomatic relations, and it comes as a natural  consequence of the positive course of the bilateral relations.    The Romanian authorities have defined the main purpose of  the  visit as being that of giving the political signal for the  development of the bilateral relations on all planes, of giving  green light to major initiatives in the economic and commercial  spheres. Another aim is that of intensifying the dialogue  between the government and parliamentarian factors,  representatives of political parties, between cultural,  technical, scientific fora, and ngo's.    Romania is interested in a closer cooperation with the  Republic of Korea in a number of sectors like  telecommunications, car manufacturing, shipbuilding, metallurgy,  food industry. There are hopes for a growth of Korean capital  investment in Romania through such important companies like  Daewoo, Samsung, Gold Star, Hyundai.    Romania is interested to learn from the experience the  Republic of Korea earned in its own process of economic reform.    During the talks, the two heads of state agreed to sign a  joint declaration that sums up the key points of the  political-diplomatic event marked by the state visit to Seoul of  the president of Romania. The declaration shows that this  summit meeting, held in a cordial and friendly atmosphere,  enabled the two presidents to have a sincere and useful exchange  of opinions about the international situation, including the  situation in the north-east of Asia and the Korean peninsula, as  well as that in the Balkans, and to examine the ways of  extending the relations between the two countries.    While Presidents Ion Iliescu and Kim Yong-sam, accompanied  by  the members of their official delegations, proceeded to  expressing their points of view on the relations between their  countries and the present international evolutions, a number of  parallel meetings between Romanian officials and their Korean  counterparts were in progress.    This evening, an official dinner will be given at the  presidential palace in honor of the president of Romania.</p>

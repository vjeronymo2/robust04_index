			<p>BFN     [Text] Baghdad, 19 May (INA)--Jordanian Education Minister  Khalid al-'Umari and the delegation accompanying him left  Baghdad today following a visit to Iraq which lasted several  days.    In a statement to an Iraqi News Agency correspondent,  al-'Umari said his visit to Iraq follows the implementation of  an agreement signed between the two fraternal countries. The  visit also aimed to study the efforts designed to enhance the  educational system in Iraq following the unfair 30-state  aggression and in view of the continued unjust blockade, he  noted.    Al-'Umari said he was briefed on the Iraqi people's  suffering  as a result of the unfair blockade, on the embargo's negative  repercussions on the educational process in Iraq, and on Iraqi  achievements in various fields in order to reconstruct what was  destroyed in the treacherous aggression of the 30-state  alliance.

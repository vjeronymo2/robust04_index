			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADMIRED BEAUTY  </P> <P> Helena Zukowski's article, "Beauty and the Beasties" (March 11), was excellent  and reflected the tranquil ruggedness of Kangaroo Island.  </P> <P> Exactly one year ago we were there as part of our EarthVentures Bicycle Tour  through Southern Australia. The trip began in Adelaide and finished in Mount  Gambier and included two days on Kangaroo Island. The bicycle trip through  Southern Australia was truly an adventure. Bill McBride of EarthVentures, 6608  St. James Drive, Indianapolis, Ind. 46217, provides first-class bicycle tours  along with unequaled camaraderie. Highly recommended.  </P> <P> BOB &amp; ALBERTA HANSEN  </P> <P> El Toro  </P></p>

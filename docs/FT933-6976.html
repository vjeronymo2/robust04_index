			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / Russia 'too kind' to Lithuania on troops RUSSIA said yesterday it had been 'too kind' towards Lithuania in agreeing a troop withdrawal timetable before signing a formal treaty on the pull-out. Mr Vitaly Churkin, deputy foreign minister, said Russia had decided not to meet an August 31 deadline for completing the troop withdrawal after Lithuania turned up at weekend negotiations, which had been expected to conclude the treaty, with a new demand that Russia make amends for five decades of Soviet rule. 'We have shown perhaps excessive kindness to Lithuania for which we are perhaps now having to pay,' he said. Some western diplomats suggested that in demanding the new concessions, Lithuania wanted to exploit a US congressional amendment tying a speedy Russian military withdrawal from the Baltics to US aid to Russia. Although Mr Churkin did not mention this, Russia is clearly anxious to avoid being put in a position of appearing to be under US pressure. Nor does it want to apologise for Lithuania's annexation by the Soviet Union, saying Russia was also a victim of the Soviet system of which it was the main component. The original formal treaty stipulated that Russia would compensate Lithuania only for material damage caused in the course of the withdrawal and possibly also for damage incurred after January 1992, when Russia declared itself the successor state to the Soviet Union. It was also to transfer some former Soviet army equipment to Lithuania's newly-formed defence forces. Mr Churkin said that the harshness of a statement telling Lithuania that Moscow would now pull out at a time convenient to itself was designed to discourage neighbouring Latvia and Estonia from also demanding compensation for Soviet actions. He said he believed the new demands were part of a 'domestic political struggle'. He pointed to the fact that the Lithuanian delegation was dominated by officials close to the radical opposition led by the republic's former leader, Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, The aim, he said, was to present the more moderate, pro-Russian government of newly-elected President Algirdas Brazauskas as incapable of standing up to Moscow.</p>

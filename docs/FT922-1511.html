			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Ashdown defends anti-Tory 'forum' MR PADDY ASHDOWN, the Liberal Democrat leader, was forced on to the defensive yesterday after colleagues claimed that his hope of changing the shape of progressive politics would split their party. His speech to a party meeting last month, in which he called for a new forum for those wishing to see 'a viable alternative to Conservatism', has been criticised by some Liberal Democrats as a return to the 1970s Lib-Lab pact. Mr Ashdown said on BBC television yesterday that he wanted a discussion about the future of British politics that went wider than just the Liberal Democrat and Labour parties. He said he wanted it to include Green politicians and Conservatives worried about their party's monopoly of power. 'There is an opportunity now to reshape the process of progressive politics in Britain,' Mr Ashdown said. 'If that were to happen it would produce the consequences that are better for democracy and better for the country.' Sir Cyril Smith, formerly Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale, warned, however, that moves to realignment on the left would divide the party. 'There would be mass resignations, probably by as many as a third of the members,' he said. 'I think it would virtually kill the party.' Mr Ashdown dismissed Sir Cyril's words with a comment that the ex-MP often launched such 'Exocets' and they usually had 'more sound than effect'. But the concern was echoed by Ms Liz Lynne, the present Liberal Democrat MP for Rochdale. 'I was voted for by a number of people who were anti-Labour,' she said. 'I got a lot of the soft Conservative vote . . . and if I said I was in favour of any deal with Labour I would be selling them out.' Mr Ashdown emphasised that talking to other parties and finding common planks of policy did not necessarily lead to electoral pacts. He said he shared the distaste for pacts expressed by Mr John Smith, the leading contender for the Labour leadership.</p>

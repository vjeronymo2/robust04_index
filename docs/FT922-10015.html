			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (11): Builder of the permanent, not the ephemeral - Profile: Gordon Wu THERE cannot be too many chief executives of large companies who listen to Faure's Requiem while sitting at their desktop computer studying the latest financial projections for their company, but then Gordon Wu is no ordinary chief executive. In Hong Kong today, where so much money is made simply by shuffling paper, what marks out Mr Wu is that he is a builder of the permanent, not the ephemeral. When many of his peers' creations are levelled in 10 years to make way for the next glossy and marble-clad tower block, people will still be using Mr Wu's roads, riding on the railway he built and using the electricity from the power stations he constructed. Mr Wu is the managing director and the largest shareholder of Hopewell Holdings, a company which started life with Mr Wu as a Hong Kong property developer in the late 1960s but, since the early 1980s, has become one of the biggest private sector developers and builders of power stations, roads and railways in China and south-east Asia. The transformation of Hopewell is the result of this protean manager's drive and imagination, aided, in no small part by the support of his bankers, in particular the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, and his shareholders. Mr Wu, whose company is valued at around HKDollars 17.7bn, manages his empire from the top floor of the Hopewell Centre in the not-quite-so-fashionable Wan Chai district of Hong Kong island. His office has a slightly donnish air; most available wall space is covered with book-filled shelves, pictures, and his sound system. Mr Wu was born on December 3, 1935, in Wan Chai, not a half a mile away from his current office. He is the seventh of nine children and his parents' third son. His family, like the district in which he was born, were of humble origins. His father, who died last year, was also born in Hong Kong. He was a taxi cab driver who progressed from owning a half share of one cab to owning a fleet of 378 by the time Mr Wu helped him sell his company in 1969. He supported Mr Wu throughout his early years in business, and Mr Wu speaks of him with respect bordering on reverence. A large photograph of his father is prominently displayed in his office. His early schooling was with the Jesuits; later he attended Princeton University, New Jersey, where he read engineering. 'I did all right at school. But I was never a serious student. At Princeton I graduated with a gentleman's C plus.' The 1950s was the time when the US was at the peak of its power; a 'blue-skies' optimism infused the country and it clearly affected Mr Wu. He left the US with the desire to earn a million dollars and the belief that with money 'you have selective power: you can afford to make mistakes, you have that extra margin for safety'. Mr Wu returned from the US to Hong Kong in 1958. For the next four years he worked first for a private engineer/architect and then for the Hong Kong government's works department - all to get a certificate that would entitle him to be included on the government's list of accredited architects. In the summer of 1962, with this achieved, he went to his father with a business proposition. Mr Wu wanted to become a property developer, but a developer with a difference. He wanted to own the land, design the building, build it and either sell it or manage it. In short, he brought vertical integration to property development. 'My father thought the idea was good and he put up HKDollars 6m. The first building was a 10-storey apartment block; the land cost HKDollars 250,000 and I got back 100 per cent of the cost in two-and-a-half years. I did several more, always recycling the money I made into the next project.' There was one characteristic of the business career of Gordon Wu in the 1960s and early 1970s: crisis, but crisis overcome through detailed planning. Most of the crises were outside his control - bank runs in 1965, the Cultural Revolution in 1966/67, the stock market collapse in 1973 - but each time he was able to persuade his bankers to support him. And the reason? Because he was always able to present them with a coherent vision of the future. Take his first crisis, the one of 1965 which was precipitated by a run on two of the colony's leading Chinese-owned banks, Ming Tak Bank and Heng Seng Bank. 'I banked with the Hongkong Bank - my father banked with it and encouraged me to. The bank runs precipitated a 50 per cent drop in property values. Cash flow was in great jeopardy. 'Within a week of the runs I went to see Peter Hutson, chief accountant of the Hongkong Bank. I explained to him our position and presented him with a 10-page memorandum explaining our cash flow position and what we needed to keep the company viable: a HKDollars 3m loan. With that we could get through. 'He read the memorandum and in five minutes he said we could have the money. Two months later I saw him and he told be if I had come to see him a week later the funds would not have been available.' Mr Wu's relations with the Hongkong Bank have been close and enduring. His point of view is simple: 'Keep nothing from your banker and work out your problems together.' He repeated this procedure again and again. In the summer of 1967 a crisis of a different sort presented itself. His father announced he was going to retire. This threw the 34 year-old Mr Wu into a state of temporary depression. He looked at his life and figured he had accomplished nothing. 'I couldn't ask my father for money as my brothers and sisters would make the same demand. So I asked him to guarantee a loan for HKDollars 15m instead. 'If I made it, then the guarantee would be academic; if I didn't I would write it off against my inheritance. He agreed and I ran all the way to the Hongkong Bank. 'Willie Purves was chief accountant then (he is now chairman of the bank) and the date was December 1, 1969. Willie is a straight talker, no bullshit, no nonsense. I put the HKDollars 15m into property. With some friends (still directors of Hopewell) I founded Hopewell Holdings.' Mr Wu's relationship with Mr Purves, forged in those early years, has been of great importance to him. When Hopewell was taken public in 1972, Mr Purves was asked on to the board. When, in 1986, Mr Wu needed a large loan to allow him to take up the rights in a Hopewell's HKDollars 5.8bn rights issue, Mr Purves, by then chief executive and chairman-designate of the bank, had approved it before Mr Wu even approached Hongkong Bank. Gordon Wu's decision to change from property developer to builder of roads, bridges, railways and power stations was the result of one big mistake. In 1979, when property prices in Hong Kong were rising sharply, Mr Wu decided to diversify. He thought the local market was overheated and unsustainable. At that time he viewed the property market as a combination of supply/demand and location. Today he realises that he missed one key factor: growth in personal income. 'At that time China had opened the door and I thought it must present better opportunities than Hong Kong,' he says. 'So I decided to do something else and infrastructure seemed to be shielded from many commercial risks: you don't start to construct a power station until you have sold all the production first. Y K Pao didn't build ships before someone had already agreed to buy them. A super highway is the same thing. Infrastructure is safe.' That was the beginning of his now famous super-highway which, when completed will link Shenzhen to Guangzhou and Guangzhou to Zhuhai. It was also the beginning of his involvement in the development of power stations. He has built one and is now constructing a second and, by the end of this year, he plans to announce a third. He has repeated his success in constructing power stations in China with the building of one in the Philippines. But his most imaginative project is the one just beginning in Bangkok. When it is finished Bangkok will have a badly needed mass transit railway. The railway will be elevated and on top of it will run an expressway for cars. The cost: USDollars 3.2bn. As is characteristic of most great ideas, Mr Wu's solution for Bangkok's urban transport problems was born of necessity and, not a little frustration. 'I got stuck in a traffic jam for a couple of hours. There were five of us in the car. We were in Bangkok to look at building a power station. It was August 1989. 'I said if traffic was a problem it can be cracked. There was a wide railway reserve going through the city and Stewart (Elliott, his long-time British associate) said why not use that. 'No sane person has invested money in a railway this century. But if it were elevated and covered so a freeway could go over it and we could develop the adjacent land then it might work. 'We put the proposal down on paper and sent it to the minister of transport. He immediately came to Hong Kong and invited us to Bangkok. They had their technical people look at it they gave us the green light. 'The hitch was it had to go out to tender. My heart sank, it was our idea and now we would have to let others try for it. The government decided to make it a quick tender and required that bidders deposit USDollars 60m. There was only one bidder.' Physical work on the project started last month with work on the foundations for the elevated transport system. The whole system will be constructed in five stages taking an estimated eight years to build. Hopewell will make money out of developing property adjacent to the railway. The opportunity missed in Hong Kong in 1979 will not be repeated in Bangkok. As Mr Wu points out, supply/demand favours the developer in Bangkok, incomes of the Thais are rising rapidly and he has the locations - they are right next to the railway he is building.</p>

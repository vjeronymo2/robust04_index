"Rapid swings of exchange rates are a minus not only for Japan  but also for the global economy, and I will explain this at the  G-7 meeting," Fujii told the House of Representatives' Budget  Committee.    Finance ministers and central bankers from the G-7  industrial  nations are to meet in Frankfurt on Saturday.    Asked by an opposition lawmaker about a planned income tax  cut for fiscal 1994, Fujii indicated that an income tax cut will  be carried out in the following years as well. "It seems that  the income tax cut has been misunderstood as one for a single  year only," Fujii said.</p>

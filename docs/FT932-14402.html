			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Cross Border M&amp;A Deals The expansion and contraction of UK and US companies generated a number of last week's cross-border mergers and acquisitions, writes Brian Bollen. Royal Bank of Scotland took another step forward in its long-term strategic US expansion programme by agreeing to buy Boston Five Bancorp. Hanson described its purchase of Watt Housing Corporation in the US as a bolt-on acquisition as part of its continuing programme of expanding its core businesses. The latest deal in the telecommunications sector saw AT&amp;T of the US buy Shaye Communications, the UK-based wireless telephony specialist. Siebe, the UK's largest engineering business, strengthened its position in the temperature, appliance and industrial process control markets with the acquisition of two European controls companies. It is paying a total of about Pounds 25m for Eberle of Germany and Schmidt Amaturen of Austria. The week's non-core and debt reduction disposals included the sale by Ashley Group of the UK of Distribuciones Gimenez y Compania, a Spanish food retailing operation, to Parafax. The buyer is a Hong Kong company formed for the purpose of acquiring retail companies by a consortium of investors including Sir Ralph Halpern. Smith &amp; Nephew completed the sale of its interest in Smith &amp; Nephew Plastics in Australia as part of its strategy of concentrating on its core worldwide health businesses. ICI completed the disposal of its Canadian-based nitrogen products business. Inchcape, the international services and marketing group, said it was moving into Turkey's expanding market for consumer goods by taking a 55 per cent stake in Inchcape Retrans.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                         CROSS BORDER M&amp;A DEALS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BIDDER/INVESTOR       TARGET       SECTOR     VALUE        COMMENT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hanson (UK/US)        Watt         Building   Pounds 75.5m Bolt-on buy                       Housing (US)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Royal Bank of         Boston Five  Banking    Pounds 63m   RBS Scotland (UK)         Bancorp (US)                         Continues                                                            US growth  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Parafax (Hong Kong)   Digsa        Retailing  Pounds 53m   Ashley Group                       (Spain)                              disposal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Terra Industries (US) Unit of ICI  Chemicals  Pounds 36m   Another ICI                       (UK)                                 disposal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Siebe (UK)            Eberle       Engi-      Pounds 25m   Total cash                       (Germany)/   neering                 consider-                       Schmidt      Controls                ation                       Amaturen                       (Austria)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Pacific Cup           Unit of      Plastics   Pounds 17.4m Australian (Hong Kong)           Smith &amp;                              non-core                       Nephew                               disposal  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Snyder Oil (US)       Command      Oil        Pounds 12m   Normandy                       Petroleum                            Poseidon                       (Australia)                          selling                                                            stake  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- First National Bank   Midlantic    Banking    Pounds 10m   FNB continues (South Africa)        (HK)                                 interna-                                                            tionalisation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Kingstream Resources  Plateau      Mining     Pounds 1.2m 'Unbelievable' (Australia)           Mining (UK)                          offer for                                                            shell  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- AT&amp;T (US)             Shaye        Telecoms   n/a          Plugging                       Communi-                             portfolio                       cations                              gap                       (UK)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

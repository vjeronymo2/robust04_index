			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Veba decline 20% VEBA, the German industrial conglomerate, confirmed yesterday it would maintain its dividend at DM12 a share despite pre-tax profits dropping by 20 per cent to DM2.342bn (Dollars 1.435bn) in the year to December 31. Net profits, after goodwill write-downs, fell by 14.7 per cent to DM1.043bn, down from DM1.222bn the year before. Net income after minority interest stood at DM906m, down from DM1.095bn in 1991. 'The current drop in earnings is not strong enough to lower our dividend. We are prepared to follow a smooth rather than strict correlation between earnings and the dividend,' the company said. Group sales for 1992 rose by 9.9 per cent to DM65.4bn. Two-thirds of the increase reflects the acquisition of the forwarding company, Schenker. Production costs rose by 11.2 per cent. Earnings per share for the group went down by 9.7 cent to DM26.20 in 1992, down from DM29 the year before. The drop in earnings per share does not include the restructuring costs of DM109m in the chemical divisions and DM246m in the power generating business.</p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Arts: Moscow Stations - Theatre / Down-and-out in Brezhnev's Russia On a suburban train from Moscow, Venichka Yerofeev is trying to get to Petushki. He has consumed an heroic number of vodkas since early morning, which seems to be the best way of coping with down-and-out life in Brezhnev's Russia. Already - as perhaps always - he is gently, beatifically bleary, and as the stations go by he regales us with notes on his journey, anecdotes and reminiscences. Moscow is huge and bleak, and he has never actually managed to find the Kremlin there; in Petushki, however, jasmine scents the air and a lovely woman awaits him. As far as we can tell, he never quite gets there. Venedikt Yerofeev was an intellectual drop-out whose short novel Moskva-Petushki was published in samizdat during the 1960s. In Stephen Mulrine's eloquent adaptation, it makes a rich, blackly funny monologue for Tom Courtenay (who did it first on Radio 3). The obvious comparison with Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell goes only a little way: though Moscow Stations is autobiographical too, Venichka has none of Bernard's cheerful malice, nor - overtly, anyhow - anything of Louis-Ferdinand Celine's scathing fury at the ruined life around him. Instead, like a holy fool, he observes the bizarre, ludicrous and pitiful things that go on around him kindly and dispassionately, from the safe depths of his alcoholic haze. The comedy is mordant, but it is not he who puts the bite into it. Though the drift of the narrative is as uncertain as the direction of the train, the images of moral and civic decay tell their own story. A closer model would be Diderot's once-famous Le Neveu de Rameau, in which another dissolute dissident floats through another collapsing social order. At the Garrick Theatre Tim Hately's stage furnishings are minimal (but crisply enhanced by lighting, sound and direction, respectively by Ian Sommerville, John Irvine and Ian Brown). For almost two hours Courtenay meanders and stumbles with rubber-legged grace on a long, sharply tilted ramp, bare but for a crude bench. Without actorly displays, he conveys a whole, wryly baffled character and his milieu, in a vodka-sodden baritone that holds up beautifully to the challenge. The Garrick is tolerably well suited to the show, though more intimate surroundings would be better. If you go, sit close: the wealth of pawky Courtenay touches that make it more than a staged radio monologue may be partly lost on the back rows.</p>

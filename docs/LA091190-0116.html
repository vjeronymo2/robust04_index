			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAPAN AIR LINES INVESTS IN LOCKHEED SUBSIDIARY  </P> <P> Lockheed said Monday that Japan Air Lines will be the first customer for its  new aircraft maintenance center in San Bernardino and will make an equity  investment of several million dollars into the Lockheed subsidiary doing the  work.  </P> <P> Under a memorandum of understanding, JAL will take roughly a 10% equity  position in the Lockheed Commercial Aircraft Center Inc., a subsidiary located  at Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, said Skip Bowling, a Lockheed vice  president overseeing the new operation.  </P> <P> Lockheed formed the operation earlier this year, planning to use hangars that  will be vacated by the Air Force when it shuts down the base in 1994.  </P> <P> Bowling said the JAL work will amount to about 15% of the capacity of the new  operation, which will be dedicated solely to doing structural modifications and  maintenance on aging Boeing 747 jetliners. Under Federal Aviation  Administration directives, aged 747s must go through extensive modifications to  strengthen their structure. Those modifications take up to 90 days per  aircraft, in addition to routine structural work.  </P> <P> JAL has the world's largest fleet of 747s, operating 65 aircraft currently with  commitments for another 69. In addition to investing in the operation, JAL will  have a management role in quality control, a Lockheed spokesman said.  </P> <P> "They have the reputation in the industry of having one of the best quality  control capabilities," he said.  </P> <P> Bowling said Lockheed is initially investing about $20 million to refurbish and  outfit two hangars at the military base to conduct 747 maintenance work.  Lockheed expects to have 600 people working at the facility by 1992 and a total  of 1,000 when all four hangars are in operation, a spokesman said.  </P></p>

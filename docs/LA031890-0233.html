			<p><P> March 18, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURRENTS: A GUIDE TO THE BEST OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;  </P> <P> SHOPTALK;  </P> <P> ADDICTED TO SOAPS  </P> <P> THE IDEA FOR a soap-opera boutique bubbled from the brain of  writer-producer-promoter Dick McInnes, whose soap involvement is legendary:  He's arranged sea cruises that bring together soap stars and their fans; he  heads a soap-star softball team, and he hosts his own show, "S.O.A.P.," for  local radio and public-access television.  </P> <P> The Bubble Boutique has amassed merchandise for the large and avid group of  soap fans, people of all ages and from all walks of life who find themselves  addicted to daytime TV serials.  </P> <P> TK-months old, the boutique is the first store in Los Angeles, and possibly on  the planet, to cater exclusively to the desires and whims of the TV-romance  audience. All Bubble stock is soap-opera-related -- some of it generic  (sweaters, T-shirts and mugs inscribed with such heartfelt messages as, "I  Can't Cope Without My Soap") and some pertaining to specific soaps. A bumper  sticker reads: "Genoa City, Wisconsin. Population: Young &amp; Restless." And  "Days of Our Lives" devotees can find the latest book of poetry by MacDonald  Carey, a cast member since the show's inception more than two decades ago.  McInnes also promises a continuing lineup of personal appearances by soap  stars. A bulletin board for soap-opera fan clubs worldwide publicizes events  and gatherings.  </P> <P>  The Bubble Boutique, TKTK Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood; (213) 466-3804.  </P> <P> JANEY MILSTEAD  </P></p>

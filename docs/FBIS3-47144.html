			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The following are the Declaration on the Current  Situation and the Immediate Fighting Slogans, which are  documents of the South Korean National Democratic Front [SKNDF]  Central Committee, which were approved by the expanded meeting  of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee held in  Seoul on 2 January.    The Declaration on the Current Situation approved by the  expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central  Committee follows:    The political situation of the new year demands that we wage  a definitive struggle [chong kyolsan] against the Kim Yong-sam  civilian regime. The Kim Yong-sam regime, which was launched by  publicizing its civilian status in the womb of the Sixth  Republic, loudly beat the drum of change and reform during its  10 months of power. The result is only the sediment of military  dictatorship and the regime has done nothing for the people.    Our people cried out calling for genuine democratization,  but  the Kim Yong-sam ring blocked the road to genuine  democratization by false democratic reform and built a civilian  fascist dictatorship more vicious and crafty than the military  fascist dictatorship. His political reform resulted in the  revival of the notorious National Security Law and the Agency  for National Security Planning and the lengthening of the billy  club used for the repression of demonstrations from 71  centimeters to 105 centimeters. Business conglomerates were  given special favors for investment and the working masses were  forced to face a new nightmare of sharing pain in his political  reform. At the same time, the drama of state fraud and four  unconstitutional cases, used to judge social reform, were sealed  off unrectified and the main culprits have begun to reappear.    Our people have waged a bloody struggle for independence,  but  the Kim Yong-sam ring, in an attempt to shore up its fragile  power, sold our people's national sovereignty and interests to  outside forces. There has been no ruler in South Korea who did  not engage in treachery, but no ruler has ever dared to sell out  the rice market -- the people's flesh and blood. The Kim  Yong-sam gang began to bargain over the opening of the rice  market as early as when he contended for power as a presidential  candidate, and sold it out completely as a card to check the  North-proposed package solution to the nuclear problem.    There has been no ruler in South Korea who did not serve as  a  stooge for the United States, but there has never been a stooge  like Kim Yong-sam, who asked the U.S. forces in South Korea to  remain continuously and left all human and material resources in  U.S. hands as strategic supplies in return for his role as a  shock brigade to implement the U.S. concept of a new Pacific  community.    As the five bandits of Ulsa in 1905 sold out the country to  the Japanese imperialists and as traitors Pak Chong-hui and Kim  Chong- pil signed the treacherous South Korea-Japan agreement in  exchange for the property claim of $300 million, the Kim  Yong-sam gang today is opening wide the door for reinvasion of  the Japanese reactionaries, who are attempting to ignore the  claim for the liquidation of the past wrongs they committed  during the Japanese imperialist colonial rule and for the wrongs  they committed against the Korean women forced to prostitute for  the Japanese Army, and who are attempting to come to the fore as  a military power and a nuclear power.    All the fellow countrymen have been ardently wishing to  realize reunification in the nineties, but the traitorous Kim  Yong-sam clique is leading North-South relations to a state of  extreme confrontation under the pretext of the nuclear issue,  thus driving the nation toward the calamity of nuclear war.  Because of the Kim Yong-sam clique's treacherous act, the door  for dialogue and exchange, which was open even under the Sixth  Republic's military dictatorship, is completely closed under the  civilian regime, the North-South agreement is nothing but mere  paper, North-South relations are totally frozen, and dark clouds  of a nuclear war are looming over the nation.    As traitor Syngman Rhee started the Korean war with the U.S.  imperialists' backing yesterday, so traitor Kim Yong-sam is  instigating a nuclear war with the backing of nuclear powers  today. The Kim Yong-sam ring, seeking stability in its ruling  system, is blocking and obliterating our masses' movement of  change for independence, democracy, and reunification. The Kim  Yong-sam regime even enforces the right of emergency  coordination [kingup chojongkwon] and the right of forced  dispersion [kangje haesankwon] with its new public  security-dominated rule far worse than the Sixth Republic's  public security-dominated rule in order to turn the movement of  various strata into ruins. At the same time, it is employing  all sorts of tactics to discolor the change-aspiring mass  movement into a citizen's reformist movement.    Because of the birth of the Kim Yong-sam government, South  Korea is not heading for independence, democracy, and  reunification, but for a hell of fascism, subjugation, and  nuclear disaster under an illusion of a civilian government. It  is our people's general view that the traitorous Kim Yong-sam  government must not be forgiven any more.    Along with all people who aspire for independence,  democracy,  and reunification, the SKNDF announces its resolute separation  from the Kim Yong-sam government and solemnly declares that it  will overthrow it.    1. We must overthrow the fake civilian government and  establish a real, independent, and democratic government. The  Kim Yong-sam government is the traitorous group that is  poisoning democracy and is bringing a fire of nuclear war to the  country with outside forces after creeping into Chongwadae  [presidential office] under the cloak of a civilian government.    Our people cannot introduce the cause for independence,  democracy, and reunification -- which is written in blood --  into the illusion of the civilian government. All strata of the  patriotic masses, who want to live for independence and  democracy, must bravely struggle to overthrow the fake civilian  government, which is fascist-oriented, and to establish a real,  independent, and democratic government.    2. We must earnestly carry out the movement for  independence, democracy, and reunification. Kim Yong-sam  government's reform is fake and is aimed at maintaining the  stabilization of a ruling system. The real reform lies in  achieving independence, democracy, and reunification. Earnestly  accelerating the movement for independence, democracy, and  reunification in a proper manner is a solemn order of the times  and a historic mission.    The masses from all walks of life must make the  popular-oriented struggle, which started as a result of the  struggle against the rice market opening, become the movement  for independence, democracy, and reunification.    Reality is not a situation for compromise, but rather a  situation for struggle. All change movement organizations must  not be involved in a dirty reformist trend, but instead they  must make the masses become conscious through struggle; organize  them through struggle; and create a vitality for the new leap of  the reform movement.    Let us more clearly uphold the chuche banner of reform by  driving out the wind of reformism. The anti-U.S. struggle is a  basis of the national and democratic movement. Without the  anti-U.S. struggle, we cannot expect independence,  democratization, national peace, and reunification. Let us  terminate the colonial fascist rule by waging a nationwide  anti-U.S. struggle to expel [chubang] the United States and  establish national sovereignty.    3. We must make all patriotic democratic forces unite as  one. Chongwadae is now plotting to disperse our patriotic  democratic forces from within and to obliterate them by  isolating them from the masses. The present situation requires  the patriotic democratic forces to unite unconditionally as one.  Let us unite over and over again. The change movement of our  masses -- which has inherited the vigor spirit of our nation by  experiencing the 19 April uprising, the May Kwangju popular  uprising, and the June democratic uprising -- will adhere to the  chuche banner of change to the end and move forward until the  day we remove colonial rule, the fascist dictatorship, and the  national division from this land and when we achieve  independence, democracy, and reunification. Destruction will  be brought to the traitorous persons who aspire subjugation,  fascism, and separation. The victory is our masses, who fight  for independence, democracy, and reunification.    Hurrah for independence, democracy, and reunification!    The following are the Immediate Fighting Slogans, adopted  at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF  Central Committee.    Overthrowing the Kim Yong-sam traitorous regime and opening  a  road toward independence, democracy, and reunification today is  the will of the popular masses and the call of national history.    At the call of the situation and the will of the popular  masses, the SKNDF Central Committee releases the Immediate  Fighting Slogans.

Let us reject the treacherous call for labor-management  cooperation and industrial peace through struggle and activate  the labor movement!    [Words indistinct] One million students! Lead the way in  inciting 40 million people as demanded by the political  situation!    Making reforms and criticizing while participating in the  establishment leads one to self-destruction. Let us remove the  dirty trend of reformation in a chuche-oriented way. Workers,  peasants, and the youth and students! Highly raise the flames  of the popular movement, realizing that they are masters among  the three major groups [as heard]!    Let us expand the solidarity and joint struggles of people  from all walks of life!    Let us combine the ranks of national, democratic, and  patriotic forces into one!    Let us wage struggles with unity and achieve unity with  struggle!    All people! Overthrow the aggressors and nation-sellers and  hasten the coming of independence, democracy, and reunification!    These were the Declaration on the Current Situation and the  Immediate Fighting Slogans, which were adopted at an enlarged  meeting of the Standing Committee of the SKNDF Central Committee.</p>

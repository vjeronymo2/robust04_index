			<p>921219 FT  19 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Tesco shops abroad Tesco's diversification into France represents a small step for the UK's second-biggest food retailer but may be seen as a symbolic leap for the industry. The move is one of the strongest signals that its leaders are intent on diversification after the current surge of superstore openings runs its course. By the mid-1990s, the UK food retailing landscape will have a very different feel. Sainsbury, Tesco, and Safeway will have added another 250 superstores, exerting effective dominance at the upper end of the market. Their stores will be generating large cash flows. Some of it will be ploughed back into replacement stores; the remainder will probably be used to diversify. Sainsbury will expand its US chain. Tesco has now set its sights on the continent. As a first step, the choice of Catteau can hardly be faulted. The purchase is big enough for Tesco to learn about the French market and small enough to limit the risks - Catteau's profits represent less than 3 per cent of Tesco's. The intriguing question is what comes next. If the strategy is to make any sense, a sizeable acquisition must surely follow. In spite of Tesco's management skills, shareholders may yet wonder whether that would be wise. In some countries food retailers are run as safe utility companies with predictable earnings and high dividend payouts. UK grocers seem set to chance their arm rather than do the same.</p>

			<p><P> January 5, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> JAPAN CAR SALES UP 12% IN '89  </P> <P> Trade figures released today showed car sales in Japan rose 12% in 1989, and  strong demand is likely to drive vehicle sales to their fourth consecutive  record high in 1990, industry sources said.  </P> <P> Sales rose to 5.56 million units last year, nearly 12% higher than 1988,  figures released by the Japan Automobile Dealers Assn. said.  </P> <P> The Japanese market is strong not only as a result of demand for replacement  vehicles but also among first-time buyers. Japanese have been buying more cars  thanks to rising disposable income and low interest rates on car loans,  especially among dealers of foreign cars.  </P> <P> Some people scrapped plans to buy houses or condominiums because of their high  prices and purchased cars instead, the sources said.  </P></p>

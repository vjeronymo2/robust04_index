			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jaime Campmany: "Mr. Prime Minister"] </F>   [Text] Mr. prime minister: Your responsibility in this  national outrage is on the point of moving from the world of  politics into the realm of the criminal. You have always sought  to limit the responsibilities of socialist politicians in cases  of corruption to two authorities: criminal responsibility to  the authority of the Courts of Justice; and political  responsibility to the judgement of the voters, as expressed at  the ballot box.    So far, this formula has offered you enough comfort to  govern  and a comfortable calmness in impunity. Legal power finds  itself politicized to a degree that suits your politician's  calmness, and the voters have continued losing their confidence  in you and your "felipismo," but so slowly that one would have  thought that this confidence would never disappear. Montesquieu  was quite dead and the vote of the electorate was, to a great  extent, captive.    However, the time came when the functioning of the  institutions of the state was seriously weakened. The  traditional and apparently indelible credit in two fundamental  institutions dropped: the Bank of Spain and the Civil Guard.  When the governor of the Bank of Spain, who, with his  signature, guaranteed our banknotes, turned out to be defrauding  the Finance Ministry and a rogue who abused his position to make  himself rich; while the director of the Civil Guard turned out  to be a fugitive from justice on a wanted list with a price on  his head, then tell me, Mr. prime minister, what can we count on  in the hallowed halls of the state. And those are just two  examples, perhaps the most striking ones, but they are  accompanied by a multitude of large, medium, and small examples,  like Manrique's rivers, which all lead to the sea! Here,  corruption is already a broad expanse of sea whose shore cannot  be seen.    It is with sadness and with all due respect that I say this,  but I have to say it. You, Mr. prime minister, seem at this  time the leading person responsible for the major corruption  scandal surrounding the nation and rotting it through and  through. It is no longer possible to present your sin as a  simple and venial sin of omission. It is not that you sat  there, Mr. prime minister, with your arms crossed and your hands  dangling before the growing flood that has inundated Spanish  politics, turning it into a sewer. No. It would have been  possible to blame it on convenience, blindness, clumsiness, or  on softness, or perhaps on a brazen lack of concern, a feeling  that "it is none of my business."    However, it is possible, and necessary, to find more and  more  serious responsibilities in your position. You not only agreed  to corruption, you not only closed your eyes to it and ignored  it, you not only "tolerated" it -- in the exact sense of the  word -- but you went much, much further, Mr. prime minister.  You hid it; you denied it; you covered it up, as a  criminologist would say. You made it possible with your  protection, and you encouraged it with your complacency.  Moreover, before investigating it, discovering it, and  condemning it, you turned it into a crime of defamation by those  who were denouncing it. You insulted the only Spaniards who  were uncovering, discovering, and showing the voters the stew  cooking in your kitchen, in your government, in your party, and  in your entourage.    Mr. prime minister, this transcends political responsibility  and comes close to criminal responsibility. Now you want to  gain time before accepting these responsibilities, but you are  only succeeding in drawing nearer to the home of your friend  Carlos Andres Perez and the painful situation of your friend,  Bettino Craxi, who has been tried and relieved of his passport.  In just a few years, you ruined your political life, the  history of the Spanish Socialist Party, and the hopes of a large  part of Spain. Leave your sense of shame aside, Mr. prime  minister.</p>

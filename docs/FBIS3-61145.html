He is a graduate of the local School No. 7. He served in the  Soviet army from 1983 through 1985. He has been an active  participant in the Karabakh movement. He was imprisoned in 1991  during the Safonov Polyanichko regime. After staying in prison  for six months he was exchanged with Azerbaijan's deputy chief  justice who was "kidnaped" by Samvel's comrades headed by his  brother, Garo. Samvel is one of the organizers of Karabakh's  first guerrilla squads. During the "Ring" operation his squad  liberated the Dzamdzor village of the Hadrut region. He then  participated in the liberation of Khojalu, Kharadakhlu and  Shushi. Subsequent military operations were planned and  implemented under his leadership. He is also a deputy in the  Supreme Council of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic [NKR]. He is  married and has two children. Below is an interview with Samvel  Babayan, commander of the NKR armed forces, by Maksim  Hovhannisian, head of the NKR's information and press  department. The interview was conducted last week just before  the regrettable incident at Matakhis [involving an attack on the  Russian envoy] for which the NKR State Defense Committee  severely criticized the leadership of the defense forces.    [Hovhannisian] Let us begin this interview with the most  important question: Do we or do we not have an army?    [Babayan] We do. Despite all of its flaws, today our  republic  has a regular army which is able to defend our borders against  enemy incursions and ensure that people can work in peace.  Furthermore, if it becomes necessary to strike at the enemy on  its own territory to ensure the security of the people, our army  is capable of accomplishing such tasks.    [Hovhannisian] How was the idea of creating a regular army  born?    [Babayan] When we liberated Shushi and opened the Lachin  corridor, we realized that we need to create a regular army in  order to preserve our military gains over the long run. Many  agreed with that idea but did not take any concrete steps. At  this point certain mistakes were made. Then the painful period  of failures began. First we lost Shahumyan, then most of the  Martakert region. Many people lost faith in our forces. Despair  became our greatest enemy.    In order to overcome this string of failures it was  necessary  to launch a decisive counterstrike against the enemy. That could  only be done by a well-trained regular army, which we did not  have.    At the beginning it was very difficult. Many of the  guerrilla  squads refused to obey general orders, and their forces operated  in a haphazard manner. It was relatively easy to implement our  plans in the Askeran region and the results were observed  quickly.    The process of creating an army began to move forward in  August of last year. Of course, it cannot be said that we have  solved all the problems associated with the creation of an army.  However, we have established a barracks regime in the army,  except that a battle proposal by the general command is not  considered a battle order. Also, orders are carried out in a  qualified manner, although not always. That is related to the  training of the army. Mechanisms of army life are being created  and perfected with each battle.    [Hovhannisian] These days there is much talk in the press  about the offensive operations of the NKR army. It is said that  the army has a vested interest in such operations.    [Babayan] Yes, some newspapers have written that everyone  wants peace except the army. That is not true. What the army is  doing has only two objectives: to ensure the security of the  population and the inviolability of our state borders and to  force the enemy to recognize our national rights. All of our  operations are coordinated with the NKR leadership. Let us take  the demilitarization of the Kelbajar region. Without that  operation it would be impossible to return the refugees from  Martakert to their homes because there was always the danger  that the enemy could strike from behind. There was a time when  the panicked residents of Martakert were not only abandoning  their homes but were also deserting the ranks. Now the situation  is completely different. Today the borders of that region are  defended only by the military units of that region.    Let us take another example. Why was it necessary to  demilitarize the city of Agdam? First, it was necessary to stop  the artillery attacks from Agdam on Askeran and Stepanakert.  Second, it was necessary to force the enemy to sit at the  negotiating table. As is known, the first official  Azeri-Karabakh talks began after the fall of Agdam. However,  Azerbaijan declined to continue that dialogue at the instigation  of certain international forces.    [Hovhannisian] The world press and international  organizations hastily condemned the advances of the NKR army.  Despite those condemnations, we undertook military operations on  the southern front. How can that be interpreted? Are we thumbing  our noses at world opinion? Are we confronting international  forces? Is not our posture defiant?    [Babayan] That is how it appears at first glance, but the  actual state of affairs tells a completely different story. As  you know, in 1991 the Azeris occupied 24 villages in Hadrut with  their "Ring" operation. Second, they were shelling Martuni,  Hadrut, Edillu and other Armenian population centers as well as  the Lachin corridor continuously from Fizuli and Kubatlu. Third,  we made it known to them that things will not end with Agdam and  that they must reckon with the reality that has been created. It  is these considerations that prompted the launching of military  operations on the southwestern front. As a result, there were  Azeri-Karabakh talks in Moscow sponsored by the Russian  Federation. It is not a secret for anyone that NKR gained  international recognition as a party to the conflict only after  our military successes. People recognize might. I repeat: the  NKR army wants peace, and, in my opinion, we must have a strong  and battleworthy army so that peace will come quickly.    The Azeri side requested several times to extend the  ceasefire. We agreed, although we know very well that they are  using that time to regroup their forces. We are similarly  preparing to greet the enemy appropriately.    [Hovhannisian] Let us return to the problems associated with  the creation of an army.    [Babayan] The [NKR army] must be a battleworthy mobile  entity  equipped with modern weaponry; it must be ready to strike at the  enemy at any point in the republic; and it must be able to  defend our borders on land and in the air. I do not think that  it is possible for NKR to survive without such an army.    [Hovhannisian] That is how it has turned out to be. Perhaps  one of the peculiarities of the Karabakh movement is that our  fedayeen [guerrilla] boys have risen to the highest ranks of the  army. These boys are patriotic, brave and prepared to defend our  land, but many of them have no military training. Some of them  have not even served in the [Soviet] army.    [Babayan] That was the case at the beginning. Today we have  in our army hundreds of senior professional officers who have  received serious training in the Soviet army. As for the fact  that many of the commanders are yesterday's fedayeen boys, those  men have learned the art of war on the battlefield and passed  muster by hard experience. We have young people who are formally  trained and who want to serve their homeland in the ranks of the  NKR army. They are the real future of our army. I would like to  take this opportunity to appeal to all staff officers from  Karabakh who serve in the armies of Russia and other countries:  Brothers, return to Karabakh, and let us defend our homeland  together.    [Hovhannisian] What has been the principal accomplishment in  the creation of the army?    [Babayan] Today every soldier in our army takes a  ceremonious  oath, and the orders of the commanders are being executed  without objections at all levels. We also managed to end the  practice of serving in the army while staying home. Today we are  strictly maintaining a barracks regime in our military.    I also consider an important accomplishment the creation of  quite normal, technically satisfactory bases for different  domains of military service. For example, we take pride in our  tank repair facility where everything has been built on solid  foundations.    Until recently our barracks were housed in buildings  formerly  occupied by schools and kindergartens. We have now built, with  our own resources, barracks with basic facilities, training  centers for different military units with their own firing  ranges and other facilities.    [Hovhannisian] Doubts have been expressed in the foreign  press that little Karabakh does not have the economic means to  acquire such quantities of military equipment and that Armenia  is helping us.    [Babayan] The first part of that statement is true. It is  true that economically we are not that strong, especially in  conditions of a blockade, to acquire as many weapons and as much  ammunition as we have in our hands today. However, they are  wrong about the sources of such acquisitions. We have captured  80 percent, if not more, of our military means from the enemy.  Various anectodes circulate among our soldiers about this  subject.    [Hovhannisian] For example, about one-time-use aircraft and  tanks provided to us by Ukraine and Turkey through Azerbaijan.    [Babayan] As for the question of what is our military  leadership focusing its attention on at this time, we believe  that, having been defeated on land, the enemy will try to attack  by air. Now we are working in that direction, with some success.  [passage omitted]</p>

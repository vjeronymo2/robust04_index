			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special report" by staff reporter Li Chun (2621 2504)] </F>   [Text] According to a mainland official, five state-owned  enterprises in Tianjing and Chongqing have been selected as  experimental units for enforcing the bankruptcy law this year;  that will be a most decisive step in the reform of state-owned  enterprises this year as well as the key measure which Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji is bent on taking to push the reform efforts.    Reform of state-owned enterprises is regarded as the key and  bottleneck in wide-ranging reform because of their economic  importance, and the close link to ideology. It will not be easy  to push this reform, and it will even more difficult to realize  it.    Faced with the various knotty issues in reform of  state-owned  enterprises, Vice Premier Zhu Rongji went down south to  Chongqing, a strategic industrial city, and personally made  investigation and arrangements during the spring festival this  year. He is bent on taking another bold step in Chongqing by  selecting some large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises as  experimental units for enforcing the bankruptcy law.    The state-owned enterprises selected are those with poor  management for a long time, with unmarketable products, with  assets failing to cover debts, and unable to be reorganized or  transformed through other channels. Chongqing selected a paper  mill as the first step. Should it be successful, another two  enterprises will be selected for further experiment.    There is no obstacle to allowing those state-owned  enterprises that can in no way continue operation to go bankrupt  either in concept or legal principle, but it can be extremely  difficult in implementation. Two years ago, Chongqing was the  first on the mainland to allow a state-owned enterprise to go  bankrupt. The bankrupt knitwear factory did not have many  workers, but their problems have not been properly resolved as  of today; the city government has taken up the burden itself.    According to the enterprise institutional reform plan set  last year, state-owned enterprises with a total loss of 100  million yuan per day should undergo comprehensive reform. While  formulating a plan, experts and scholars offered many panaceas;  however, taking ideology into consideration, the plan was ironed  out and the final plan became smooth and slick. At that time,  Zhu Rongji who was responsible for formulating the plan had to  admit that that was the best they could do.    The key to the reform of state-owned enterprises is the flow  and reorganization of property rights, so that enterprises may  genuinely operate on their own and assume sole responsibilities  for their profits and losses, while the government retreats from  enterprise involvement.    It is very difficult to break the old framework of the  existing structure to shape a new property ownership structure.  It would take a long time to see the successes of 100 large and  medium-sized enterprises selected as experimental units. Thus,  Zhu Rongji decided to take a risk and boldly allow a number of  state-owned enterprises to go bankrupt. Bankruptcy will shape  into a terrorizing power and pressure enterprise circles, while  promoting their renovation; on the other side of the coin,  bankruptcy and reorganization will not involve the  "deterioration" or "converting public into private ownership" of  socialist enterprises, thus avoiding criticism from the orthodox  school.    Favorable external conditions in pushing enterprise  bankruptcy lies in, first, the non-government and state-owned  economies have already been separated, and risks to state-owned  enterprises in boldly conducting reform have been greatly  reduced; second, the concept of the market economy has taken  root in people's minds, with changes in employment concepts and  matured external conditions able to absorb and digest bankrupt  enterprises; and third, there seems to be no obstacles to the  implementation of the bankruptcy law today.    The greatest risk of the bankruptcy of state-owned  enterprises seems to be arrangements for workers. A complete  and perfect social security system is absent in China mainland  today. Should past government intervention be stopped in the  absence of better ways, big problems would be ahead. That  accounts for the principle of experimenting first before  spreading the practice.</p>

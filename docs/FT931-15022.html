			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / Karachi awaits next move by army BUSINESSES in Karachi, Pakistan's commercial heart, have relaxed their guard since the army was sent last May to restore order in the southern province of Sindh, of which it is the capital. The army says over a hundred gangs involved in robberies, kidnappings, car thefts and drug peddling have been smashed in Karachi, and no kidnappings for ransom have taken place in the last two months. Before the troops arrived, kidnappings of businessmen were frequent. Signs of improved law and order are visible on the streets. Many shops are open later, and businessmen previously afraid of being kidnapped or robbed are more relaxed when travelling. 'The situation has improved since the army has come in. We feel much more secure than before,' says Mr Ali Mashhadi, a carpet dealer. However, security is due to be reviewed this month. The government could order the troops back to barracks if the situation was judged to have improved sufficiently. There are signs of differences between civilian and military leaders over the future of the operation. The provincial government of Mr Muzaffar Hussain Shah, which is backed by the ruling alliance of Mr Nawaz Sharif, prime minister, wants the army to stay until there is complete assurance that gangs of criminals will not resurface, a senior official says. Generals are concerned, however, that improvement in law and order needs to be backed by socio-economic measures to curb poverty, rising unemployment and drug addiction. Only with such action, they argue, will long-term improvement in the security situation be assured. 'The malaise is political, economic and social. This is not a military problem,' says one general. Unemployed young people in Karachi's growing slums are prime targets for recruitment to crime gangs. The chairman of a large industrial company says: 'Good municipal planning to cater for the needs of ordinary people is an absolute must for improving conditions in Karachi. Unfortunately, there is very little of that going on right now.' Some businessmen argue that to ensure long term socio- economic development, the government in Islamabad should introduce tax incentives to accelerate business growth in Karachi, stimulating employment. Mr Tahir Khaliq of Karachi's chamber of commerce says new investments are badly needed and will only come if there are new concessions. He is concerned about the possibility of political troubles if the army pulls out. The army operation led to the discovery of torture cells and extortion rings in Karachi, allegedly run by the Mohajir Qaumi Movement, a party for Moslems who had migrated from India. Businessmen are waiting anxiously for the government's decision. Mr Khaliq says: 'If the government is confident that things have certainly improved and if they feel that the army can be called back, I just hope that they know what they are doing and they realise fully what could be the consequences.'</p>

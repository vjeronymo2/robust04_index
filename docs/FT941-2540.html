			<p>940319 FT  19 MAR 94 / Private View: The high priest of pure French There is a sportswear shop in Calais called 'Athlete's Foot'. I was thinking of it last week in Paris on my way to the Academie Francaise, that venerable custodian of the French language, when I passed a marine equipment shop called 'Nauti Store'. As I crossed the Seine in the spring sunshine, pondering the Balladur government's announcement of a language bill with stiffer penalties to enforce the public use of French, I was nearly run over by a breakdown van. Painted in large letters on its side were the words 'Yellow Cad'. The perpetual secretary of the academie, its commanding officer in the war against linguistic corruption, is the writer and anglophile Maurice Druon. 'Je vais commencer alors par un statement,' he said as he ushered me with a flourish of Gallic courtesies into his elegant cabinet room. 'I'm a great admirer of the style of Gibbon and Churchill. Bon. Voila comment je vous accueille.' Druon does not, God forbid, speak franglais. He is a former minister of culture, member of the French and European parliaments and a winner of the Prix Goncourt. He was with de Gaulle's Free French in London during the second world war. No, he switches with virtuous ease between the two tongues, according to the mood of the moment. In his own language he is declamatory, rolling the words around his tongue with the relish of a wine-taster. In English he has the upper-class drawl of the clubman (he is a member of the Garrick and the Savile), and makes redundant apologies for the poverty of his syntax and pronunciation. We sat in matching armchairs with aged leather seats. The first 'Immortals', the founder members of the academy set up by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635 as a supreme court to decide the rules of French, looked down from the walls. 'A cup of tea, perhaps?' said the perpetual secretary. A butler arrived and set down a silver tray. I began by asking: What, really, is the threat? Isn't the academy's attempt to preserve the language culturally stifling? Druon sighed. 'I answer in another way. I much regret that you have not an academie anglaise, a state institution to watch over your language.' As for the academy's work, he continued: 'Did that stop the Enlightenment, the philosophes of the 18th century? Did it stop the industrial age, the discoveries of the 19th century? Did that stop Pasteur? Did it stop Claude Bernard, or - closer to us - the Curies or the Duc de Broglie?' But aren't things different now? Perhaps French is becoming fossilised . . . 'Fossilised?' Druon stared with disbelief. 'Fossilised? When in the first volume of our dictionary we have 5,000 new words? In the former edition, of 1935, there were about 35,000 words. Our new edition (it has reached the word 'enzyme') will have at least 50,000 words, probably more - that is, 15,000 accepted new ones.' He got up and walked about. 'Do you play golf?' he said. I said No. 'When people propose oiselet for 'birdie' or, I don't know, obstacle de sable for 'bunker' I raise my shoulders and I say 'Let the expression pass] Foutez-moi la paix]' Because golf terms are English and we have adopted them.' The academy had even accepted anglicisms such as 'tennis' which derived from the French - as in tenez] To recognise words for which there is no substitute is one thing, I persisted. To legislate for the control of language seems to me quite another, extraordinary thing. 'Sir. You have been informed by the French press, which is very badly informed.' He gave his wheezy, smoker's laugh. 'It's not a law on the French language, it's a law on the obligation of using French in various areas.' Yet if it suits a firm to use English internally and that facilitates business, why not? 'Why use a foreign language if the user is not an English speaker?' In some cases, he added, it could even be dangerous - if, for example, technical instruction manuals were not in French. I agreed. But there was a time, I said, when the whole of Europe used Latin for certain purposes. Today we clearly need a lingua franca and . . . 'But exactly] You have the French language]' He was triumphant. Isn't English the lingua franca now? 'Listen. There we are going to have a difference of opinion. For one thing, the English language is no longer what it was. What is sprayed all over the world is not really English. It's American. It's not the English tongue, it's a dollar tongue.' But the Latin spoken all over Europe was dog Latin, not the Latin of Tacitus or Cicero. 'Certainly. That's why it has been replaced by the French]' If this bastard English is useful, why should we not speak it where it's appropriate? 'Where is this notion of useful? It's useful in commerce, in advertising, useful in money. It is not useful for the mind.' The academy has about 40 members - usually septuagenarians - of whom Maurice Druon, of course, is one. (There are also two women now). I stuck out my neck. Why should the language of the majority, I asked, be determined by the sentiment of an old minority? 'It's not an old minority. It's an old majority.' But why should they have this power? 'Sir. Words are a means of exchange. That's a currency, and bad currency . . . comment dire, chasse . . . drives out, the good. We are trying to keep a good currency. That's why we accept a lot of new words if they are in common usage. Don't think we are the enemy of English . . .' I read that people refuse to employ the gallicisms that have been created for them. Why not let the market decide what is most appropriate? 'If you let in the market, you let in the jungle.' Can you resist the market in this age? 'Bien sur. Bien sur. One can dissuade. Monsieur, we are there to give the sense of sin. Commit it by all means, but know that you are committing a sin.' Isn't that bad law, like the law against smoking in bars, which I hear is widely disregarded? 'Listen. I am smoker, but this is another matter. It goes much further. The language of a people is its soul. If you love your country, you must love your language. It is the fundamental intellectual patrimony. It is what determines, to a large extent, your identity. And as perpetual secretary of the Academie Francaise, it is I who am in the vanguard.' But, of necessity, behind the rest of the country? 'Mais, No]' I compared the Academie Francaise with the Vatican, and Druon talked of the four great institutions of Europe before the first world war. The one that had not survived, he said, was the general staff of the German army. I did not understand the French phrase so the academicien went to the bookshelf and plucked out Harrap's dictionary, screwing a monocle into his eye to read the entry for me. As a writer (he told me he had sold 11m copies of his books in Russia alone) Druon is concerned not just with words, but with syntax. And the Anglo-Saxons, he said, were losing control of their syntax. Do you mean that thought itself suffers when syntax goes? 'Yes. Ah, yes.' And political ideas will become more banal? 'The political question is the ability of the new generations to construct and express their thought in proper sentences.' The importance of the message impelled him back into French: 'You cannot dissociate words from thoughts. And it's to preserve this quality of the formation of ideas that we conserve French, a language which is analytic, precise and clear. We don't want it to lose its clarity. 'If we get to the point of using false English words in French, that is the height of degradation. Another idea: it is not good for the world, for humanity, to have only one language, because that language will not keep itself pure.' Isn't that to overstate what's happening? 'Wait. A sole language, a uniformity, a pidgin angloricain spreading over the planet. It's very bad. We need different languages. If there is no difference there is no melange or confrontation of cultures. New ideas will not be born.' Can we not have horizontal boundaries between languages - the peasant speaking his patois, the bourgeois his demotic, the international civil servant speaking English? 'I'm no more in agreement with you. The human spirit must have a language that transcends all levels and specialities. 'Look, I'm an old Anglophile. I should not want English and French to be enemies, but allies. Because they are both carriers by nature of the values of liberty and dignity. So we needn't deprive ourselves of either.' Most countries, I said, manage without linguistic laws and academies. What makes France so different? 'Ah, ca] Perhaps because we are the oldest nation in the world with the sentiment of nationhood. Also because the instrument we have forged, the linguistic instrument, became the lingua franca of the 18th and 19th centuries. All the countries of Europe, Great Britain excepted, were intellectual provinces of France. But this is because of the quality of our language.' I tried one last shot: it has fewer words, I believe. 'Dare I say, you have less syntax. And besides - I don't want to be disagreeable - if English has had some success it is because it is the easiest language to speak badly.' He gave another wheezy chuckle. That, perhaps, is its great advantage, I said. But you say English, too, needs preserving? 'Yes.' What shall we lose if we don't create an academie anglaise? The power of literary expression? 'No, your soul.' The perpetual secretary laughed. There was no reply.</p>

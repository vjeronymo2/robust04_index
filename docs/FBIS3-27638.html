			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yesterday afternoon [19 February] the provincial  government held a news briefing on the province's 1993 economic  and social development. In 1993 the province maintained a good  and speedy trend of economic development and made new  breakthroughs in major economic indices, which manifested  themselves in the following aspects:    First, the aggregate economic volume increased to a new  level  and the national economy developed rapidly. Last year, the  province's gross domestic product topped 100 billion yuan, to  stand at 114.6 billion yuan, an increase of 12.6 percent over  the previous year and the province's highest record since the  introduction of reform and opening up. The province reaped a  good agricultural harvest in the course of structural  adjustment, and maintained rapid industrial growth. The  fixed-asset investment increased by a wide margin, and markets  grew brisk amid stability.    Second, the province further improved its economic  structure.  This manifested itself in the structural change in primary,  secondary, and tertiary industries. The rural production  structure improved further. The investment structure was  adjusted.    Third, the economy developed comparatively rapidly. Taking  the province as a whole, tertiary industries developed rapidly,  town and township enterprises developed even more rapidly, and  the individual and private economic sectors made more  contributions to the province's economy.    Fourth, there was good convergence between production and  marketing, economic results improved, the economic order  gradually returned to normal as a result of the implementation  of state macroeconomic control and regulatory measures, and the  economic environment improved markedly.    Fifth, the income of people in cities and towns increased.  Last year their per capita income amounted to 2,443 yuan, while  peasants' per capita net income amounted to 851 yuan. Allowing  for price rises, the former increased by 10.1 percent over the  previous year and the latter by 2 percent.    In 1993 the province registered good development in the  national economy and in social undertakings, but there also were  problems and drawbacks. For example, the shortage of funds for  economic development still remained unresolved, commodity prices  rose too rapidly, agricultural investment was inadequate, and  social order needed further improvement. For this reason, the  provincial government asked departments and governments at all  levels to take positive and effective measures to bring about  sustained, steady, and healthy development [chi xu wen ding jian  kang fa zhan] in the province's national economy and social  order.</p>

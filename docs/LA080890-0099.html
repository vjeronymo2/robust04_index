			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SECURITY PACIFIC LOOKS TO HELP IN UAL BUYOUT;  </P> <P> AIRLINES: A COALITION OF BANKS IS ATTEMPTING TO ARRANGE FINANCING FOR AN  EMPLOYEE TAKEOVER. RISING FUEL PRICES CLOUD THE PICTURE.  </P> <P> Security Pacific National Bank confirmed Tuesday that it has joined a group of  banks searching for financing for the proposed $4.38-billion employee buyout of  UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.  </P> <P> But the buyout faces an uncertain future given rising fuel prices, which would  add several million dollars to the annual cost of operating the nation's  second-largest airline. The board of Chicago-based UAL will meet today amid  speculation that the union-led buyout group will be forced to ask for an  extension of its Thursday financing deadline.  </P> <P> UAL's stock fell $9.75 a share Tuesday to close at $101 a share on the New York  Stock Exchange. On July 27, the stock closed at $163.  </P> <P> "Our guys continue to work on the deal," said Steven Matthews, a spokesman in  New York for the employee group. "No extension has been requested."  </P> <P> The group, headed by former Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald, has been  pressuring aircraft and engine manufacturers to invest in the buyout. The  failure to find an equity partner has caused three defections from a five-bank  group that had informally agreed several weeks ago to arrange about $4 billion  in bank financing.  </P> <P> However, Chemical Banking Corp., Citicorp and Chase Manhattan are reported to  be interested in rejoining Bankers Trust New York and Manufacturers Hanover if  an equity investor materializes.  </P> <P> Security Pacific spokeswoman Penny Maines said the Los Angeles-based bank is  "involved in discussions with the buyout group and Bankers Trust and  Manufacturers Hanover, and we are continuing to work on the transaction."  Maines declined to say whether Security Pacific had agreed to lend $500 million  to the effort as each of the original five banks had tentatively agreed to do.  </P> <P> "It could well be too little, too late, particularly in light of what our  friends in the Middle East are doing," said Scott Hamilton, an editor of  Commercial Aviation Report, an airline financing newsletter. "The banks were  hardly enthusiastic about this deal a week ago and now . . . an iffy deal  becomes even worse."  </P></p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Electrical goods set for sales rise CONSUMER SPENDING on electrical goods will grow by almost a quarter in the next three years, twice the rate of retail sales as a whole, a report published today says. The report, by Verdict Research, says leading electrical retailers are in excellent shape and are producing remarkably good figures, given the dire trading climate. Total sales in the electrical market have grown by just 10 per cent over the past four years, less than half the rate of growth achieved by all retailers. The poor trading conditions - sales in the Pounds 9.5bn electrical market were more or less static last year - have prompted widespread discounting of goods but redundancies and company rationalisations have helped to protect profitability, the report says. Dixons Group, the market leader, has raised its UK market share by 3 per cent in the past two years, in spite of difficulties with its US operation. Profits in the audio sector are likely to be boosted by sales of the new digital compact cassettes and mini-discs, given a sustained upturn in the economy, the report says. It claims the biggest threat to the market leaders is posed by the regional electricity companies. Mergers and acquisitions have created a smaller number of regional companies with almost 10 per cent of the market. The report does not expect a clear upturn in demand to emerge until the last quarter of this year. Verdict on Electrical Retailers. Verdict Research, 112 High Holborn, London WC1V 6JS.

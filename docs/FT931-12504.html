			<p>930128 FT  28 JAN 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major sees upturn in confidence MR JOHN MAJOR said last night that Britain was set for a 'decisive move' towards economic growth, Ralph Atkins writes. He told UK businessmen in Bombay that confidence 'is beginning to return to housebuyers, consumers and investors'. Inflation was at its lowest for 6 1/2 years, interest rates were at their lowest for 15 years and the sterling exchange rate was 'highly competitive'. His upbeat comments were coupled with a promise that 'the government will be working closely with industry, especially manufacturing companies, to maximise investment in modern equipment'. Mr Major has signalled that he is prepared to listen more to businessmen - and his comments could have been a hint of extra help for industry in the March Budget.</p>

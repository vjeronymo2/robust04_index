			<p><P> May 11, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> BRAUDE PROPOSALS FOR MINIBUS, RUSH-HOUR LANE GAIN SUPPORT  </P> <P> Proposals to spend $1.2 million to start a fixed-route minibus service between  Sherman Oaks and Studio City and to make a lane of Sepulveda Boulevard  reversible to speed rush-hour traffic were unveiled Thursday by Los Angeles  City Councilman Marvin Braude and quickly endorsed by Mayor Tom Bradley.  </P> <P> Braude said the money would come from funds raised by the countywide half-cent  Proposition A sales tax, which is supposed to pay for transportation  improvements.  </P> <P> The City Council, which is debating how to spend the Proposition A funds, must  approve the spending.  </P> <P> Braude, who represents the Ventura Boulevard area in the west San Fernando  Valley, said he was hopeful that the projects would easily win council approval  because the city's Proposition A fund has a surplus.  </P> <P> "The money is already there, sitting in the bank and not being used," the  lawmaker said.  </P> <P> In a letter to Braude, Bradley said the projects were similar to ones that he  had urged the city to adopt in March, 1988.  </P> <P> Councilman Nate Holden, chairman of the council's transportation committee,  said he wanted to review the status of the Proposition A fund surplus before  taking a position on the Braude proposals.  </P> <P> Southern California Rapid Transit District board member Nicholas Patsaouras,  who joined Braude in introducing the projects, said the minibuses could be  running within three months.  </P> <P> The shuttle buses would require a $1.1-million subsidy in the first year.  </P> <P> That project calls for six buses to run 15 hours daily along a route that would  pick up passengers at several stops within the Van Nuys Civic Center, at Valley  College and along the Ventura Boulevard commercial corridor.  </P> <P> An RTD staff study found that the route, one of five studied, would have the  most ridership and would best supplement the existing RTD routes, Patsaouras  said.  </P> <P> Passengers would pay 25 cents and would be able to transfer to regular RTD  buses without paying any additional fare.  </P> <P> The reversible lane project would cost $100,000 annually and would have the  effect, during the morning rush hour, of adding an additional lane for cars  traveling south on Sepulveda Boulevard between the Ventura Freeway and  Westwood.  </P> <P> In the afternoon, the direction of traffic in that lane would be reversed.  </P> <P> The two projects would help bring equity to the distribution of the  transportation funds, Braude said.  </P> <P> "The Valley has not had its fair share of Prop. A funds in the past," he said.  </P></p>

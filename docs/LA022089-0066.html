			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: ART  </P> <P> Christie's auction house in London has held its first-ever sale of Spanish  paintings, with a lighthearted "picture within a picture" (Raimundo de Madrazo  y Garreta's "En El Estudio") fetching the highest individual price of $233,000.  The 170 paintings from the 19th and 20th centuries reaped a total of $2.1  million on Friday, with prices "well beyond expectations," said a Christie's  statement. SHAUNA SNOW  </P></p>

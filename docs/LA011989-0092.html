			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Housing Secretary-designate Jack Kemp pledged to "throw out ideology" and be an  advocate for helping ease poverty, homelessness and other urban problems. Kemp  won praise from big-city mayors in his first public appearance before them  since his selection by President-elect Bush as secretary of housing and urban  development. "I am going to be an activist," Kemp said. "I'm going to be an  advocate. The door is open. My mind is open." He spoke to the U.S. Conference  of Mayors as the group held its annual winter meeting in Washington.  </P></p>

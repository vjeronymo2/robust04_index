			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILL TO PROTECT MOUNTAIN LIONS  </P> <P> The fur has been flying since the moratorium, enacted in 1972, that provided  protection for the California mountain lion expired in 1986.  </P> <P> The California Department of Fish and Game took advantage of the opportunity  and has announced a plan to reopen the hunting season of this persecuted wild  creature.  </P> <P> The confrontation is continuing between the animal activists and the trophy  hunters, who have eliminated the wolves, jaguars and grizzly bears in  California and are responsible for the demise of the California condor. Now  they are determined to rid the California wilderness of the last remaining  major predator, the cougar.  </P> <P> The mountain lion had been decimated by bounty hunters and their cohorts, the  trophy hunters, to a mere 600 by 1972, necessitating a moratorium on hunting in  order to save the species. Unlike other game animals, the cougar is not hunted  for fur and it is not being used for food. The reason that the trophy hunters  are itching to snuff out the life of the big cat is to satisfy their desire to  kill for "fun and/or recreation," and because of their beauty to use them as  decorations on their living room walls.  </P> <P> Another reason for this bloody sport is that the innate, primitive instinct of  the Neanderthal man is still inherent in the computer-age man, wanting to  eliminate his fellow predator, competing for the same quarry. We called  American Indians "savages," but they only took what they needed in order to  survive and never killed for sport. We boast about being civilized. Is it  civilized to chase a panicked wild creature with a pack of hounds up a tree and  then shoot the helpless animal? I would call this barbaric.  </P> <P> The only solution to restrain those uncaring individuals from continuing to  lobby for mountain lion hunting tags is to enact state laws that would put an  end to the feud. There is a ray of hope now for this persecuted species. AB 860  has been introduced in the California Legislature to provide much-needed  protection for the big cat. Unfortunately, such attempts in the past have  failed. Two years ago a bill passed after bouncing from one committee to  another but died on the governor's desk.  </P> <P> Let us try again. Only the general public can swing the pendulum in the right  direction. We should bombard our legislators in Sacramento to vote for the  passage of AB 860 to assure the survival of this predator.  </P> <P> LILA BROOKS  </P> <P> Director  </P> <P> California Wildlife Defenders  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

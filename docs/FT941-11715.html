			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / BNF profits hit by Thorp: Greenpeace to challenge accounts - Results show sharp fall to Pounds 76m Delays in the commissioning of the Thorp reprocessing plant helped depress the 1992-93 profits of state-owned British Nuclear Fuels to less than half their previous year's level. BNF yesterday reported profits of Pounds 76m for the year to March 31, against Pounds 161m for the previous year. Turnover was marginally down at Pounds 1.05bn from Pounds 1.08bn. The results were at the lower end of analysts' expectations. The dividend to the government was halved to Pounds 26m. Mr John Guinness, chairman, said he expected profitability in 1993-94 to be similar to that of last year, with the Thorp delay playing an even greater role in the result. He said the Thorp effect last year was Pounds 18m, but this year it would be about Pounds 90m. Mr Guinness said next year's profitability would rebound significantly as Thorp would play a full role. Yesterday's results, and the accompanying annual report, were prepared on the assumption that the government will agree to underwrite at least some of the unexpected costs which may arise in contracts worth about Pounds 19bn with Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear. The government rejected previous underwriting arrangements. Ernst &amp; Young, auditor to the accounts, said the company considered underwriting to be a prerequisite to the completion of the contracts. Greenpeace, the environmental group, said yesterday that it was considering a challenge to the accounts on the basis that the government may not agree to the underwriting. The Department of Trade and Industry said it was considering the revised underwriting arrangements. BNF said that there were several reasons apart from Thorp for the downturn in the profits. They had been depressed by Pounds 30m as a result of the nine-week shutdown in 1992 of Magnox reprocessing at Sellafield, Cumbria, the company's biggest cash-producing operation. BNF said the money could be recouped in future years. A further Pounds 40m depressant was an advance writedown of costs associated with the merger of BNF's enrichment assets at Capenhurst, Chester, into a company, Urenco, which it operates with Dutch and German partners. BNF said the benefit would be a rise from 8 per cent to 15 per cent of returns on investment in the project over the long term. It put restructuring costs, including staff cuts, at Pounds 20m. Although total numbers rose from 15,783 to 16,186, this was partly due to increased needs for staff for Thorp. It said further internationalisation of the company was a priority.</p>

			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAMES FLANIGAN: A PENNY SAVED IS AN ECONOMY STRENGTHENED  </P> <P> Anxiety about the U.S. economy is running high. The latest statistics -- the  government's leading indicators, factory orders, the intentions of corporate  purchasing agents -- all point to a slowdown in business.  </P> <P> And the mood is anxious in the stock market, which fell sharply last week,  although prices bounced back a bit on Monday in slow, pre-Fourth of July  trading.  </P> <P> The worry is about recession. Will the economy only slow down or will it tumble  into a new recession like that of 1982, with massive layoffs and economic  suffering?  </P> <P> The answer almost certainly is slowdown. What the economy is really doing is  not declining into recession, but undergoing a profound shift from the 1980s to  the 1990s, from a heavy dependence on debt financing to a healthier reliance on  savings and investment. The transition may be wrenching, but ultimately the  economy could emerge stronger for the decade ahead.  </P> <P> Evidence for such a hopeful outlook is in statistics on debt and personal  savings. U.S. companies and consumers are not adding to their debts, notes  Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, the securities  firm. And that is encouraging, even though one reason debt isn't growing is  that many companies and individuals are already borrowed to the limit.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Americans Saving More  </P> <P> The fact is, banks and other lenders are now collecting more in interest each  year than they are laying out in new loans -- and that's a condition that  should lead to a fall in interest rates.  </P> <P> Even more hopeful is the news that Americans are saving more -- 5.7% of their  disposable income in the first quarter of 1989, compared to 3.7% through all of  last year. That's the highest level of savings in four years and reflects both  a slowdown in spending by consumers worried about the economy and an aging baby  boom population thinking about retirement.  </P> <P> It's a good beginning for a pattern of higher savings, although still below the  7% to 8% of their income that Americans saved in the 1950s and '60s when the  economy was truly strong.  </P> <P> It's those savings, many analysts believe, that are generating long-term  confidence about the U.S. economy and boosting the dollar's value on world  markets -- despite the prospect of falling interest rates, which normally would  bring the dollar down.  </P> <P> Change, however, is not painless. When economies shift, some industries suffer.  As a general rule, those industries that depend on high levels of borrowing  will do comparatively poorly in the new environment. They include commercial  real estate, already in the doldrums in many cities, and residential real  estate, which has slowed even in Southern California. Retail stores and auto  dealers may be hurt as consumers spend less.  </P> <P> But the payoff will be in a healthier economy in the 1990s, says Peter Rona,  president of IBJ Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Co., a U.S. joint venture of the  Industrial Bank of Japan and London's J. Henry Schroder banking company.  </P> <P> "If we could just get the savings rate closer to 8%, we would have balanced  trade and the need for foreign investment would be reduced," says Rona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lower Dollar Hurt Industry  </P> <P> It is important that domestic savings be able to finance U.S. industry, he  explains, because continuing to depend on Japanese investors to buy $50 billion  to $65 billion a year in U.S. government bonds and other securities is not  healthy.  </P> <P> The money stopped coming once, says Rona, when Japanese buyers fearing a  decline in the dollar stayed away from U.S. Treasury auctions last fall, and  could do so again. The American economy weathered the capital shortage at the  time, but interest rates rose.  </P> <P> Thus, the lower dollar that in one sense was helping U.S. industry sell its  goods on world markets was hurting it in another way by raising interest rates.  U.S. companies have to borrow at 11%, while Japanese companies borrow at less  than 5% and West German firms at 6%.  </P> <P> It's probably no accident that, since then, thinking appears to have shifted,  so that a lower dollar is no longer seen as the key to U.S. competitiveness.  Rather, there is greater understanding among financial and economic experts  that, if domestic savings increase, then U.S. industry can enjoy lower costs of  capital and be competitive with a strong dollar.  </P> <P> "We can come into the 1990s with an economy driven by savings and investment,"  says Merrill Lynch's Clough. He is not alone in that vision. It is shared by  economists Deborah Allen at California's Claremont Economics Institute and  Edward Yardeni at Prudential-Bache Securities, who have long anticipated an  increase in savings among Americans.  </P> <P> If those experts are right, the long-term outlook is bright indeed. The  immediate prospect is for lower interest rates; that's why bond prices are  rising at the moment. Then, the next upturn in the economy and in the stock  market will be led by companies making electrical equipment and other machinery  for expanding U.S. industry and for export to growing foreign economies.  Foreign investment will still be welcome in U.S. markets -- perhaps even more  welcome because, with adequate domestic savings, it won't be so critically  needed.  </P> <P> That's a comforting vision to be sure, but there are many who see it through  the present anxiety.  </P></p>

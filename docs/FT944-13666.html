			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Polish broadcasting row grows In a continuing row over commercial television and radio licences, Poland's parliament is to be asked to set up a committee to examine whether Mr Janusz Zaorski, the head of the TV and Radio Council regulatory body, is infringing the country's broadcast laws. The motion came after deputies yesterday asked Mr Zaorski, who was appointed by President Lech Walesa last summer, why he was delaying signing a broadcast licence awarded months ago to the French pay-TV channel, Canal Plus. The French channel is at the head of a queue of broadcasters promised commercial licences, but are awaiting Mr Zaorski's confirmation.</p>

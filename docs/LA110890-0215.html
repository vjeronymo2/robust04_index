			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THIS COMIC KEEPS HIS BACK AGAINST WALL;  </P> <P> STAND-UP: TODD GLASS' PORTABLE STAGE -- COMPLETE WITH IMPROV-STYLE BRICK  BACKDROP -- MAKES HIM INTO THE MOBILE COMEDIAN. THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE HE'LL  TRY HIS SHTICK.  </P> <P> There are a lot of comics working the clubs out there, but Todd Glass must be  the only one who has performed for a herd of cows.  </P> <P> Glass, who has dubbed himself the Mobile Comedian, has a portable stage --  complete with Improv-style brick wall -- on the back of his truck, so he can do  his stand-up routine when and wherever he wants.  </P> <P> His impromptu bovine gig came somewhere on the road between here and Salt Lake  City. Glass thought that the cows looked kinda bored and, well, a little comedy  seemed just the thing to perhaps liven their day. As he asked rather  rhetorically during a recent interview at the Improvisation in Irvine, "When do  you think the last time they got a show was?"  </P> <P> The Fountain Valley resident also does al fresco performances on the beach and  even outside the clubs where he performs. He has performed at colleges, at  parties and outside the Department of Motor Vehicles. He tried his shtick in  moving traffic, but a cop put a stop to that.  </P> <P> "To be driving down the road and see an eight-foot brick wall is a strange  sight," Glass allows.  </P> <P> The 25-year-old started his Mobile Comedian gigs in April, not as a gimmick or  to get more work, he says (he's a regular middle act at the Irvine Improv and  other Southland clubs), but just because he thought it sounded like fun.  </P> <P> "It's, like, the corniest idea in the world. I know it's stupid," Glass admits.  </P> <P> But, he says, people seem to respond: "They see this guy trying to do something  new, and they support it."  </P> <P> Unlike his more structured stage act, Glass' Mobile Comedian performances rely  heavily on audience interaction and a man-on-the-street approach.  </P> <P> Glass' freewheeling style and quick wit have a risky side: Comedy club  audiences may be prepared for his sometimes-pointed remarks, but what about the  unsuspecting public at large?  </P> <P> "Sometimes you totally annoy somebody," Glass says, but, he adds: "They're so  few that they're funny. And of course, I only get more annoying and louder and  more obnoxious."  </P> <P> Most people, though, catch on quickly. "Everyone knows the brick wall from TV,"  Glass says, and they associate it with the prototypical comedy club.  </P> <P> While Glass started the project as a lark, he's beginning to get wise to its  promotional possibilities. He envisions the Mobile Comedian taking on a persona  of his own and paving the way for TV work. In fact, camera crews from the  Comedy Channel followed Glass around San Diego last month and will begin airing  brief segments during commercial breaks and between shows.  </P> <P> Many comics say they disdain TV, but Glass freely admits that he'd love to land  a regular gig on a TV show, no matter how bad.  </P> <P> "Everybody's goal is to get into people's living rooms," Glass says. "Even if  it's the worst thing in the world, I would be in people's living rooms."  </P> <P> In the meantime, though, Glass is not ready to let the Mobile Comedian  overshadow his regular stand-up act. On the contrary, he is apt to use his  impromptu outdoor shows to promote his stage appearances, in which he covers  material ranging from his jealousy of traffic cops ("That's my dream in life --  to drive real slow and have no one pass me") to impersonations of the painfully  contorted expressions his dad took on when smoking.  </P> <P> Glass is also given to rushes into the crowd, as he does in a bit where he  parodies a fan who relates a little too strongly to the comedian on stage  (Comic: "I was talking to my girlfriend the other day . . ." Fan: "He has a  girlfriend?! I have a girlfriend! This guy is just like us!").  </P> <P> Glass sees the Mobile Comedian as a logical adjunct to his stage career, which  started when he began frequenting open-mike nights in his native Philadelphia  at age 16.  </P> <P> "I'm a stage hog," he says, "and I can't get enough stage time."  </P></p>

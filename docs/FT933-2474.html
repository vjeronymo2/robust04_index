			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Macallan-Glenlivet lower at Pounds 2.16m Pre-tax profits of Macallan-Glenlivet, the whisky distiller, fell from Pounds 2.84m to Pounds 2.16m in the half year to the end of June. Turnover fell to Pounds 6.49m, compared with Pounds 6.93m. The company blamed weak demand for new fillings and lower interest rates which cut net interest income from Pounds 474,000 to Pounds 279,000. It added that full year results were expected to reflect the trend of the first half. Earnings per share were 1.37p (1.77p) but in view of longer term prospects and the board's confidence the interim dividend is being raised from 0.3p to 0.36p.</p>

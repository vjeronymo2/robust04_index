Comrade  Jiang Chunyun said: Top leaders of the provincial party  committee, the provincial people's congress standing committee,  and the provincial government should all personally take a hand  in environmental protection work. The provincial government and  the provincial people's congress standing committee should  assign special persons to take charge of this work. We should  regard the success or failure in environmental protection work  as one of major contents to assess the official performances of  leading cadres. Those who perform well should be commended, and  those who do not should be criticized and educated. Comrade Zhao  Zhihao said: It is arduous and difficult for us to control  environmental pollution. Principal leading comrades of party  and government organizations must personally take a hand in this  work and list it as a major item on their daily agenda.    The provincial environmental protection work conference was  held in Taian from 25 to 27 December. The conference reviewed  and summarized the province's environmental protection situation  over the past several years and researched and arranged the  tasks for the future work.

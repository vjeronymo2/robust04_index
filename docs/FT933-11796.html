			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Trade News: US dismisses 40 'dumped' steel claims THE US International Trade Commission yesterday discarded 40 of 72 steel complaints brought by the US industry against imports from 20 countries, saying that the 'dumped' and subsidised steel had not injured American producers. However, most of the high-value corrosion-resistant products and cut-to-length plate were found to have caused harm. Duties of up to 109 per cent levied temporarily by the US Commerce Department will now become permanent. Two cases from the UK, involving subsidised and 'dumped' cut-to-length plate, were both found to have injured US producers. Steel is defined as 'dumped' when the Commerce Department finds it was sold in the US 'at less than fair market value'. Sir Leon Brittan, EC external economic relations commissioner, described the ruling as 'most encouraging' and said it would do much to improve the atmosphere for the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks. Appearing somewhat surprised that the ITC had rejected many of the complaints, Sir Leon said the ruling would 'help to defuse substantially what had become a very grave trade dispute'. The six ITC commissioners - three Democrats and three Republicans - all spoke of the complexity of the steel market and the difficulty of their decisions. Mr David Rohr, a Democratic commissioner, said the process which produced yesterday's mixed results emerged from 'the most open and transparent of any anti-dumping or countervailing duty regime in the world'. He insisted: 'There is no place or opportunity in that process for political considerations.' Many of the companies which avoided duties held only a small market share. Producers from Argentina, Australia, Italy and New Zealand emerged completely unscathed. All hot-rolled and most cold-rolled imports were found not to have caused injury. Japan's hot and cold-rolled imports were found not to have caused injury but the ITC found against its important corrosion-resistance line. Andrew Baxter adds: British Steel said last night that the 109 per cent duty on plate 'would not unduly hurt us financially'. Its exports of steel plate to the US were worth Pounds 7m in 1991, less than 0.7 per cent of the total US market.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Electricity customers warned on bills row INDUSTRIAL electricity users may face legal action if they go ahead with their threat of refusing to pay the nuclear element in their annual power bills when contracts are renewed in April. Large consumers say they will not pay the nuclear part of their bills - which amounts to 11 per cent of the total power charge - in protest at electricity price increases. The UK generators and regional electricity suppliers must pass on the levy to the government and may sue the users to recoup their money. Mr Jim Keohane, director of energy contracts at East Midlands Electricity, said, 'We won't do anything precipitate, but if they don't pay the levy, then we can start charging interest on any part of the bill that is unpaid or we might institute legal proceedings to recover our money.' Mr Keohane said he was sympathetic to the concerns of the main users, since they will be facing large price increases in April, largely arising from the price rise for wholesale electricity in the so-called 'pool'. The UK generating companies, National Power and PowerGen, say pool prices must rise to reflect their costs. In a recent speech to big users, Mr John Baker, chairman of National Power, urged them to be extremely vigilant about the additional costs such as the nuclear levy which are included in their bills. He refused to comment yesterday. PowerGen called the Pounds 1.2bn nuclear levy 'unjustifiable'. It said: 'It's unfair that customers and taxpayers should pay for keeping open old nuclear plant.' Industrial users' electricity bills are made up of four main components, but charges for power make up more than 70 per cent of the total. The other elements include charges for using regional companies' wires and the transmission cost of using the national grid, as well as the nuclear levy. National Grid, the company that runs the UK's transmission system, said yesterday it would keep the cost of using the grid the same - on average - this year as last year. A protest about delays in granting licences to National Power and PowerGen to operate under the Environmental Protection Act was sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, by Friends of the Earth yesterday, John Hunt writes. The two generating companies should have been given authorisations by the Pollution Inspectorate by the end of August. The authorizations wouold have limited power-station emissions. The act requires details of the companies' applications to be placed on a public register. The companies appealed against that on grounds of commercial confidentiality. The Department of the Environment yesterday said a report on the appeals had been written and was with Mr Heseltine. Ms Fiona Weir, FoE air pollution campaigner, said Mr Heseltine was allowing the power generators to hold up implementation of 'vital new pollution laws'.</p>

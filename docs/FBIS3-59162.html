			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by P. Alisanoglou: "Drilling in Oil Deposit Larger </F> Than Prinos"]    [Text] The NAPC [expansion unknown] Consortium decided  suddenly to start two new drilling operations beginning  yesterday in an oil deposit it regarded until now as  "uneconomic."    The deposit is located west of Thasos Island and according  to  data the NAPC has (exclusively) the new deposit is larger than  that of Prinos.    The decision of the foreign Consortium was reached in  Toronto, Canada, in the presence of all the big stockholders and  confirms TA NEA information, which claimed in 1979-1980 that  "NAPC has found oil west of Prinos but closed the well for  unexplainable reasons." The justification offered at the time by  NAPC that presumably the deposit west of Thasos was small and  that the return on drilling was to be marginal, was not valid.  This is borne out now, because the NAPC managers would have  never spent $15,000 to $20,000 -- if not more -- to conduct  exploratory-productive drilling operations in a "small" deposit.  They knew in advance the potential and the daily yield of the  new oil deposit and they were waiting for the proper time to  revise their contract while the New Democracy was in office to  open the "well" of western Thasos with its assured oil deposits  which for them constituted a safe "reservoir."  <H5>  The Ministry </H5>   The Ministry of Industry said this in an official statement:    "After a long period of inactivity during the previous  government, the drilling in `northern Prinos' is now under way  in the second section of the Prinos oil exploration region. The  Public Petroleum Corporation and Hydro-Carbonate Exploitation  [DEP-EKY] is a participant in this region with a 15-percent  share in the consortium which will undertake the drilling  according to the revised contract of 9 December 1987 which was  ratified by Law 1769/1988.    "The significance of this drilling is that the potential  discovery of an oil deposit will extend the life of the existing  deposit in Prinos while it will require a minimum investment  since the exploitation will utilize the existing installations  of Prinos."  <H5>  The Contract </H5>   DEP-EKY data indicate that the objective of the drilling is  "to find out any serious indication for an oil deposit."    Nevertheless, trade union circles note among other things  that, with the drilling taking place without previously setting  in motion the process for the vision of the law that was enacted  by the New Democracy shortly before the election, the charges  and revelations of those being then in the opposition are  totally wasted.    It is noted in this regard that the DEP-EKY management  should  have informed the political leadership of the Ministry of  Industry. With this drilling, an investment of some $15 million  is being made in effect which according to the law (recommended  by the then-president of DEP-EKY Goulas) will be paid off  through the cost of the oil. In other words, in addition to all  the other concessions we have made, we allow the consortium to  do this, thereby reducing even further the Greek share. The  contractor evidently will inflate these costs (as it did in  Prinos) to keep a greater amount. Moreover, this cost will be  borrowed and therefore subject to interest payments.    Regarding this contract which will result in tens of  millions  of dollars in losses for the Greek State, the Association of  DEP-EKY Personnel (its chairman is a member of the company's  board of directors) had presented the following charges on June  22, 1993.    a. The consortium tax rate is reduced from 50 percent to 40  percent.    b. The depreciation rate of the consortium is increased  while  the percentage share of the Greek State is decreased.    Based on the annual extraction of oil, the depreciation rate  for the consortium ranges from 58 to 90 percent (it was 40  percent) and the participation share of the Greek State from 20  percent to 5 percent (it was 30 percent).    c. The Greek state will receive its share from the sale of  oil once a year and not on a monthly basis as was the case until  now, thereby losing several millions [of dollars] from lost  interest.</p>

			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / New chairman knows Iri from inside: Differences within the Italian coalition on Robert Graham on differences within the Italian coalition on privatisation policy There has been a collective sigh of relief within Iri, Italy's giant state holding company, over the appointment of Michele Tedeschi as the new chairman. The appointment of a new board for Iri, the holding company founded in the 1930s under Mussolini and the symbol of state presence in the economy, has highlighted the spectrum of opinion on the state's economic role held by the different members of the government. The 54-year-old new boss has spent all his working life in various parts of Iri. Only 14 months ago, he was switched from being Iri's chief executive to head Stet, the telecoms utility, making way for Prof Romano Prodi - whom he now replaces. 'We could feel the government was undecided over how to replace Prodi,' observed a senior IRI official. 'What we feared most was an outsider who would take long to learn the ropes at a time when IRI is focusing on delicate privatisation issues.' It took the Berlusconi government two months to decide on a replacement for Prof Prodi, who resigned in May, and the appointment of Mr Tedeschi was a last-minute compromise within the right-wing coalition. The compromise is the outcome of a tortuous attempt to find a consensus in the government between two different approaches to the future of Iri. At one extreme were those like the members of the populist Northern League who regard the state holding as wholly irrelevant to a modern market economy. They believed Iri should be wound up as soon as possible through an accelerated process of privatisation and debt write-offs. At the other end of the spectrum, the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance was reluctant to see Iri disappear, especially in economically depressed southern Italy. The MSI felt a state holding had an essential role in certain strategic sectors such as defence and other areas of high technology. In the middle of these contrasting approaches, the government's economic team took a more sanguine view. They saw their priority as improving the precarious state of Iri's finances and giving the right signals to the markets on continued privatisation - especially telecoms, next on the list. In this it is significant that Mr Tedeschi has a long experience in the telecommunications sector and comes directly from helping to prepare the Stet privatisation. The new six-man board reflects the sense of political compromise by containing elements of all these views. The treasury, the ministry with the most powerful say, has ensured that Mr Mario Draghi, the director-general and a key figure on the previous board, remains. The prime minister's Forza Italia movement has placed as its candidate Mr Diego Della Valle, the 41-year-old head of the highly successful Tods shoe group. His appointment is the first occasion a real entrepreneur has been allowed near Iri's decision-making process. The MSI succeeded in nominating two board members sympathetic to the movement's ideals - Mr Roberto Tana, a company executive, and Mr Giuseppe Urciuoli, a southern industrialist. The League is represented by Mr Enrico Zanelli, a northern corporate lawyer, while the minor partner in the coalition, the Christian Democratic Centre, has a voice through the sixth board member, banker Mr Piero Gnudi. The more intriguing question is whether Mr Tedeschi will have a free hand to formulate policy or whether he will be tied by the conflicting tensions within the coalition. The first signs are that Mr Tedeschi wants to get his own way and he has proceeded quickly to place his nominees in Stet. The broad outlines of Iri's restructuring he planned himself anyway almost two years back. These were then refined and hastened by Prof Prodi. Under Prof Prodi the process of slimming Iri began in earnest. Within the last year it has sold the bulk of its financial/banking assets (Credito and Comit), privatised most of SME, the agro-industrial group, and split the loss-making Ilva, with special steels just sold to a German-Italian consortium. Asset disposals for 1993-1994 are due to bring over L3,700bn (Pounds 1.53bn), part of which has already been used to reduce the debt stock. The main immediate problem remains financial. Iri last year recorded losses of L10,191bn on a turnover of L80,000bn. This was due to a combination of the cost of servicing L75,000bn in debt and the restructuring of steel (Ilva), shipbuilding (Fincantieri) and civil construction business (Iritecna). This restructuring, plus privatisation revenues, should cut 1994 losses to L1,360bn. However, some L20,000bn of debt is still considered at risk. The rest has been mainly contracted by strong cash-flow members of the group - Stet, and its autostrada division. In his first comments Mr Tedeschi, said this week: 'In parallel with improving Iri's finances, one must speed up and go on with privatisation - whether those on the table like SME and Ilva at Taranto (flat steel products) or those which must be quickly made operational, particularly Stet.' Knowing Iri from the inside means he can start work immediately. But such knowledge will not necessarily help him navigate the political minefields ahead. In the case of the remaining SME privatisation - GS-Autogrill supermarkets and autostrada restaurants - political differences have already surfaced, Last month the sell-off was postponed until September because the MSI raised objections over the pricing. But behind this move lies MSI's broader concern over the break-up of the Iri empire. This is also evident in MSI's anxiety to avoid Alitalia, the national carrier controlled by Iri, passing out of direct state control. The neo-fascists find more support for their corporatist philosophy when it comes to discussing the defence industries and high technology which are now concentrated in Finmeccanica, the industrial and financial holding. Here it would probably be fair to say that a majority in the government still instinctively likes the idea of a state presence in the businesses controlled by Finmeccanica. In other words, Mr Tedeschi is unlikely to become a glorified liquidator of Iri. Rather, he will preside over the slimming down and refining of the state holding's presence in the economy, and privatisation will not always mean the surrender of state control of management.</p>

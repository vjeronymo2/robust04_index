Applicants will also be permitted to amend FCC Form 175, to make ownership changes or changes in the identification of parties to bidding consortia, provided such changes do not result in a change in control of the applicant and do not involve another applicant (or parties in interest to an applicant) who has applied for any of the same licenses as the applicant. Amendments which change control of the applicant will be considered major amendments. An FCC Form 175 which is amended by a major amendment will be considered to be newly filed and cannot be resubmitted after applicable filing deadlines.

			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Accountancy Column: Dons learn that 'freedom' has a bottom line - The often troubled relationship between the accountancy establishment and academia Censorship and academic accounting might seem rather unusual bedfellows, but events in the last few weeks have provided a new focus on the tensions that can be placed on dons when the world outside intersects with university life. Indications of the latest stresses came in two parliamentary early day motions tabled at the start of this month by Mr Austin Mitchell, Labour MP for Great Grimsby and accountancy profession scourge. Nine MPs have signed a motion expressing doubts about the degree of democracy exercised by the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA). And 11 have signed a second, deploring attempts by the accountancy profession to infringe academic freedom. It began with a letter in May to the ACCA from Mr Prem Sikka, Mr Mitchell's academic adviser from the University of East London. He questioned the voting procedures used in ACCA's elections earlier this year, in which he unsuccessfully stood as a candidate. The subsequent correspondence is now half an inch thick. Most significantly, the ACCA wrote to Sikka's vice chancellor in August asking whether his institution endorsed these views. Sikka saw this as an attempt to quash his opinions through pressure from above. After many more exchanges, the ACCA apologised to Sikka in November for any 'embarrassment'. It added that it was now considering reforms to its bye-laws - some of which address his concerns. Mr Anthony Booth, director of professional standards at the ACCA, says if there was institutional endorsement of Mr Sikka's views, the association may have considered cancelling its long-standing accreditation of its courses at the university which is 'based on trust'. Sikka's concerns may be overplayed, but they highlight the stresses under which academics - particularly those with controversial views - can be placed. Other episodes concerning freedom of speech have long bubbled away in the world of academia. But in the normally gossipy world of the common room and conference circuit, people tend to clam up when they are asked for examples. An exception is David Cooper, now shielded by the relative safety of a post at the University of Alberta in Canada. While Price Waterhouse professor of accounting at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) in 1984, at the time of the miners' strike, he published an article in Accountancy magazine alleging 'misinformation' in the National Coal Board's assessments of the financial viability of its coal mines. That led to indignation from a member of the board, and triggered a review of the editorial practices of Accountancy. Cooper says he also received a phone call from Richard Wilkes, a partner at Price Waterhouse, which had been appointed sequesters to the National Union of Mineworkers. 'He screamed at me about causing the firm severe embarrassment and how could we bite the hand that fed us and how PW would continue to fund the chair over his dead body,' he recalls. Mr Wilkes, now retired from PW, says: 'I did have words. It was an irritation. We were just concerned that he didn't start impinging on our activities. We were trying to keep a low profile.' After intervention from other senior Umist officials, PW continued to fund the chair. Another maverick don is Paul Barnes, Touche Ross reader in corporate finance and accounting at Nottingham University. 'I was sued for libel over my PhD thesis and I have never looked back since,' he says. His comments on the Britannia Building Society brought proceedings which remained a threat for two years. It also kindled a continuing research interest in building societies, and the persistent ire of Mr Mark Boleat, until recently director-general of the Building Societies Association. Last year Barnes wrote a piece in Accountancy on building societies, which triggered a highly-critical letter - copied to the senior partner of Touche  -from Boleat. Barnes believes this damaged his reputation. It certainly could not have helped him at a time when he was applying for a professorship  -which he did not get. Academics tell other stories anonymously: a vice-chancellor with business connections who prevented the appointment to a named chair of a left-wing lecturer; pressure from a group of accountants sponsoring a chair to influence the selection; a young researcher threatened with a writ by a group in the City when his findings proved critical of them. Nor is the problem unique to the UK. Abe Briloff, emeritus professor of accounting at Baruch College in New York, faced a defamation suit brought against him in 1976 by Saul Steinberg, the corporate raider and head of Reliance Group, after writing a critical article in Barron's magazine. Some academics are less concerned by the pressures sponsorship presents  - though most acknowledge that it does not leave them unaffected. One example is Christopher Nobes, now Coopers &amp; Lybrand professor of accounting at Reading University, who previously arranged endowed chairs at the University of Strathclyde from both Touche Ross and Ernst &amp; Whinney. His contract includes regular work for Coopers. 'In the days when firms were desperately short of graduate applicants and had quite a lot of money, a few thousands of pounds here or there to influence students was regarded as a worthwhile element in the recruitment budget,' he says to explain the level of support. 'I believe in all cases apart from mine, the firm has given money and then not really exercised any influence over the appointment. The academic might occasionally go in for lunch. 'Maybe sometimes a professor might feel constrained from saying things because they are worried about what the firm or its clients might think, or the professor doesn't like what the firm says,' suggests Nobes. 'I have sometimes not done things because of my link with Coopers. I have never said something I don't believe. Sometimes I have not said things I do believe. That is merely being responsible.' He says that if he was asked to comment on the poor accounting policies of a company, he would first ask whether it was a Coopers' client - and if so, he would refuse. 'I don't see it as a problem. It is the inevitable result of something which brings large benefits. I get much more informed on things and in effect I have to sign the official secrets act.' Even Paul Barnes, whose endowment was originally provided by Spicer &amp; Oppenheim before it merged with Touche, says: 'I did feel constrained at one time when the press were giving Spicers a bad time over its audit of Barlow Clowes.' He wanted to intervene to defend the firm, but felt he would be criticised as biased if he did. Two years ago, he wrote a piece mischievously suggesting that the poor research rating of accountancy in British universities reflected the lack of independence of its funding. More seriously, he argues that freedom of speech is hardly the prime concern for most accounting academics because they are too focused on abstract topics. 'Academics are too busy counting the number of angels on a pinhead to even recognise the existence of, say, creative accounting,' he says. Tony Steele, Ernst &amp; Young professor at Warwick University, who was himself embroiled in legal action over current cost accounting in the mid-1980s, adds: 'The real issue isn't pressure on academics because their work is so relevant, but how we can get them to be less self-indulgent and more relevant.'</p>

			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Finance package rescues Scots pit Monkt onhall Mineworkers, the consortium operating a deep mine leased from British Coal, has been rescued by Waverley Mining Finance, a quoted mining finance house. Waverley has organised a financial restructuring involving funds worth Pounds 7m. The package should enable the mine to become profitable, and will allow a second face to be opened at the Monktonhall pit, which is near Edinburgh. The minehas had financial difficulties since it began production under the miners' consortium in early 1993, after being closed by British Coal in 1987. Thefinance house is understood to be taking 49 per cent of Monktonhall Mineworkersby injecting about Pounds 300,000 of new equity and providing about Pounds 1m in loans. Waverley, on behalf of Monktonhall, has negotiated a subsidy of Pounds 1.8m from the Department of Trade and Industry, while Lothian region is to provide a grant of Pounds 230,000. Bank of Scotland is believed to be writing off a substantial part of the company's Pounds 1.8m debt and making available Pounds 400,000 of leasing finance through its subsidiary Kellock. Trade creditors have agreed to the restructuring. Mr Willie McLucas, investment manager of Waverley, said the funding would meet the need for Pounds 2m of equipment, Pounds 3m of short-term debt, Pounds 1m to fund losses before the new production from the second face and Pounds 1m of working capital. The deal is to be formally approved by shareholders next week. In November the miners rejected a bid for 100 per cent of the company fromRJB Mining, in spite of the likelihood of bankruptcy without a rescue. Mr McLucas is thought to have established a rapport with the miners which should allow the deal to go ahead. He said: 'The mood of optimism and the confidence that together we have created an exciting enterprise is most encouraging.'</p>

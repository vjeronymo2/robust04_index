A nationwide poll, scheduled for 6 March, will  mark the end of the dispute between the supporters of an  independent Moldova and those who want it to join Romania.    Hopes of a revival of the unity of the state, which for  three  years now has been "divorced" from two of its regions, the  Dniester Region and the Gagauz south, are pinned on its results  and on the results of the upcoming parliamentary elections. All  the talks with these regions have ended in deadlock, foundering  on the conditions that Chisinau must provide the regions with  guarantees in the event of a change in Moldova's political  status.    [Gamova] Mr. President, we know that you do not like sudden  movements. But your announcement of a nationwide poll was just  such a step. Before it, unification with Romania was talked of  as a reality, albeit more or less remote, but the poll and  particularly your speech at the congress of citizens, "Our Home  is the Republic of Moldova," rule out this possibility. Why did  you decide to set out your positions so clearly?    [Snegur] At the very beginning of the democratic  transformations, following the 1990 elections, when I started  work in the Moldovan parliament, I warned certain  representatives of the People's Front that, as far as I was  concerned, I would do my utmost to promote the land's  prosperity, but I would not raise the question of unification  with Romania. It is the first time I have said this, but that  is what happened. In fact, in all the twists and turns of the  state's development I have steered both partners and opponents  onto a centrist path of solving problems. But recently the  opposition set up a council for unification with Romania and  started propagandizing this possibility and elevating it to the  level of state policy. It was in order to ease the tension in  society that I announced the "consultation with the people" --  our poll, which, incidentally, does not contradict the  constitution.    [Gamova] Does such an overt rejection of the idea of  unification with Romania mean a reorientation exclusively toward  the CIS?    [Snegur] No. Incidentally, the "consultation with the  people" includes a question relating to mutually advantageous  links with all countries. We signed the agreement on the  formation of an economic union and will sign all the other  agreements deriving from this document. We established too many  customs barriers, which disrupted links between the parts of  what was once a single economic comnplex. As a result Moldova,  like the other CIS countries, has suffered enormous losses.    Unless all the documents ensuring the viability of the  economic union are signed by the heads of state in the very near  future we will be unable to escape from this situation and get  back at least to the position we had attained a few years ago.    Of course, we will also be seeking mutually advantageous  links with Western countries. But it would be unwise to abandon  the Eastern market, with which we have strong links.    [Gamova] Might Moldova eventually join the ruble zone?    [Snegur] There is no need for that. Calculations will  certainly be made in relation to the ruble. But the Moldovan  leu is doing pretty well. According to the IMF and the donor  countries, Moldova is keeping pace with the Baltic countries in  carrying out reforms.    [Gamovas] Will the Moldovan leadership's current stance  affect relations with Romania?    [Snegur] A recent meeting of the two countries'  interministerial commission in Bucharest summed up mutual  economic relations and determined the paths of future  development. The meeting took place after citizens at the "Our  Common Home is the Republic of Moldova" congress in Chisinau had  advocated the building of Moldova as an autonomous, independent  state. There was no negative reaction on the part of the  official authorities.    [Gamova] But the Moldovan leadership's position and your own  stance have come under heavy attack in the Romanian press....    [Snegur] But the attack was not at an official level, unless  you consider the Romanian Academy of Sciences to be so. The  political parties were negative by and large. But the  opposition press in Moldova was even more vigorous and more  abusive. Our path has been determined. And although the  results of the poll have no legal force, they will provide the  president with an argument for pursuing with parliament a policy  supported by the people.    [Gamova] But what if the People's Front, which is running  under new party labels in the elections, gains a majority in  parliament? The president will then lose his expected support...    [Snegur] I am hoping for a reasonable majority in  parliament. I think we will be able to form a viable new  government too. But if things develop the way you suggest, it  will be the will of the people.    [Gamova] Will the new parliament be able to resolve the  problem of the Dniester Region and the south of the republic?    [Snegur] Yes, I think so. A draft law has been prepared on  the status of the southern areas which have a high Gagauz  population. It has been scrutinized at the Council of Europe  and it suits the Gagauz themselves. The draft will be submitted  for discussion at one of the first sittings of the new  parliament.    [Gamova] What can the Gagauz realistically expect?    [Snegur] Autonomy within the republic -- something along the  lines of an autonomous oblast with certain rights, with its own  People's Assembly. The head of the entity's administration  would be in the Moldovan government.    As for the Dniester Region, we have a good basis for a  dialogue on its future status -- the CSCE mission's report.  Judging by President Yeltsin's letter, Russia also accepts  these documents, as mediator in the settlement of the Dniester  Region conflict.    Russia's mediation mission began in July 1992, when Boris  Yeltsin and I signed the ceasefire agreement. Some 18 months  have now elapsed. During that time the joint peacemaking force  monitoring the security zone has done a great deal to stabilize  the situation. The agreement brokered by Russia and the CSCE on  the legal status of the Dniester Region can then be implemented  under the observation of guarantors, for example, the existing  mechanism of the four -- Moldova, Russia, Ukraine, and Romania.    We are prepared to distribute functions between the central  and local authorities and grant maximum self-government, down to  the creation of their own legislative assembly and their own  emblems. The only conditions is that the region should be part  of the Republic of Moldova with a common army and common  constitution.    [Gamova] Could Moldova have a federal structure?    [Snegur] I do not think there will be any need for that.  Particularly if we guarantee the region the right to  self-determination in the event of a change of status by  Moldova. The problem must be resolved, otherwise the deadlock  will continue.    [Gamova] Is agreement with the current Dniester Region  leaders possible?    [Snegur] It is difficult, but we will try.    [Gamova] Final question: The 14th Army on the territory of  Moldova. The negotiating process is under way, but there is  much talk in the republic about the possibility of the creation  of a Russian military base, using its facilities....    [Snegur] We insist on the continuation of negotiations on  the withdrawal of the 14th Army from Moldova. I have not heard  any other official view from the Russian side. It is merely a  matter of the date. We are insisting on the middle of this  summer. This has not been agreed so far.</p>

			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / The Lex Column: Germany Financial markets were expecting US interest rates to rise this year, even if they responded badly when they did. They were less inclined to factor in the more optimistic economic mood in Germany. Helped by rising export orders, it now looks as though the first quarter's gross domestic product figures could show surprisingly robust growth. Bond and equity markets must soon learn to cope without the prop of falling official rates. Indeed, they may start to wonder when rates will rise again. When the Bundesbank was operating a restrictive policy, its basic concern was inflation and it tended to remain unmoved by economic slowdown. Optimists argue that, conversely, it will now be less worried about economic recovery as long as inflation continues to fall. On that basis, the easing could have some way further to go. But inflation is now below 3 per cent and the fall may decelerate. It is hard for the Bundesbank to justify lower interest rates while money supply continues to exceed its target by such a wide margin. At 4.5 per cent, the discount rate is already close to its 4 per cent trough in 1983. It looks unlikely to revisit the 2.5 per cent low of 1988, which in any case held for only six months. In the short run, this looks more of a problem for the bond market. Yields on 10-year paper, which historically tend to average around 4.3 points over the inflation rate, already assume inflation well below 3 per cent. Factor in the poor international climate and it is difficult to see why they should fall back again. Equities at least have the economic recovery to consider. Earnings should reap the double benefit of corporate restructuring and increased demand. But much of this was already reflected in last year's 50 per cent rise. Even the equity market is likely to flag if high long-term interest rates prove a drag on the recovery next year, when tax increases will also sap consumer demand. It would then be scant consolation if weak demand for credit made the Bundesbank as slow to raise rates as it was to bring them down.</p>

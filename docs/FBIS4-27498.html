			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- U.S. Congresswoman  Elizabeth Purse demanded a switchover in the Korea policy of the  U.S.    In her letter of April 8 to the U.S. President and to the  chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, she expressed  concern over U.S. armed threat to North Korea.    No one says North Korea is producing nuclear fissionable  materials, but the United States alone insists on that  possibility, she said.    War preparations against North Korea do not conform to the  supreme interests of the United States, she said, adding that  she thinks the United States must not escalate tensions but  pursue a policy for normalising relations with North Korea.    "Under the current situation," she said, "we must continue  to  use diplomatic means and improve relations with North Korea."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yemeni Vice-President 'Ali Salim al-Bid on Sunday  contacted His Majesty King Husayn saying he was ready for a  political dialogue with President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, Aden  Radio said in a report monitored by the British Broadcasting  Corporation. There was no Jordanian confirmation of the report.    King Husayn brought President Salih and Vice-President  al-Bid, as well as other Yemeni political leaders together in  Amman in February to sign a reconciliation and reform agreement.  However, the accord was not implemented and the king said last  month that Jordan was leaving a joint military commission  entrusted with separating the northern and southern army units.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Here is a comment from Foreign Minister Georgs  Andrejevs on the news received today that Russia is trying to  keep its military bases in our country.    [begin Andrejevs recording] At this time, after getting  acquainted with this document, and discussing this document in  the government, as well as talking with representatives of one  or two other countries' governments, the impression arises that  President Yeltsin has given in to the influence of more  conservative forces in Russia, which have evidently come through  the Ministry of Defence, putting forward such demands, or  proposals, let us say for the present, knowing beforehand that  they are not acceptable to Latvia, absolutely incompatible with  either the letter or the spirit of the draft treaties,  agreements, worked out long and hard, which have been initialled  in Moscow, so that their signing will not take place at all  [sentence as heard].    That is how we have to interpret it, and all three essential  things are included in (?the first line of) this order, namely:  the establishment of military bases; the testing of new types  of armaments on their territory; and the guaranteeing of the  security of these countries mentioned, including the Republic of  Latvia, to be undertaken by Russia; so, for all three of these  announcements the Latvian Government makes its explanations.    We have never agreed to the development of these military  bases in Latvia, as at present none of the military units has  the status of a military base in Latvia. We have never allowed  the testing of new types of Russian armaments. And we have not  delegated to Russia the right to provide us here with security  for this country in the event of another country's attack.    All this is mentioned in the statement adopted by the  government, which will be read out in full on television as  well. Tomorrow it is to be introduced to the envoys of  countries accredited here, and of course in the press the full  text will be [words indistinct]. [end recording]</p>

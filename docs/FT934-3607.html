			<p>931208 FT  08 DEC 93 / Letters to the Editor: Code of banking practice has failed to deliver Sir, There are times when a mere fulsome apology will not do, and the reaction of the British Bankers' Association to the December Which? report on banking services is one of them ('Customers report banking errors', December 2). If, as our survey suggests, one in five bank and building society customers has suffered mistakes in standing orders or direct debits, people should check their statements; but it is adding insult to injury for banks to demand the same. Mistakes are the banks' responsibility; so is spotting them. Urging vigilance on customers is an acknowledgement of failure and an encouragement to complacency. The Bankers' Association emerged with further, equally shameful comments aimed at deflecting criticism, complaining that our survey of more than 3,600 banking customers was, astonishingly, 'too small', and that Which? members are more likely to grumble about banking problems. On both counts, professional opinion disagrees. So, no doubt, would the chief executives of Abbey National, First Direct, Girobank and Yorkshire Bank, which topped our poll in terms of overall satisfaction. If they can please customers, why not the Big Four? The code of banking practice promised a new era of improved standards of service. It has clearly failed to deliver. If the code cannot be improved considerably and enforced rigorously, it should be replaced with statutory standards imposed at government level. Only then will the disgraceful concept of DIY account management be consigned to where it belongs: in the past. John Beishon, chief executive, Consumers' Association, 2 Marylebone Road, London NW1 4DF</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / HK video row hots up Hong Kong broadcasting authorities have showed their hand in an industry argument over how new video-on-demand technology should be regulated, saying it did not need to be covered by broadcasting laws. Wharf Cable, the territory's exclusive pay television licensee, argues video-on-demand is a public broadcast and providers should be licensed under broadcasting laws. Mr Alex Arena, director-general, telecommunications, said video-on-demand was considered a point-to-point service and not a public broadcast. Wharf Cable's three-year exclusive licence to broadcast pay television in Hong Kong expires in mid-1996.</p>

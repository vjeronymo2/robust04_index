			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (4): An embarrassment of riches - Developments in the banking sector Mr Hilmar Kopper, the forthright chief executive of Deutsche Bank, is renowned for his plain speaking. Sometimes, though, he takes this a little too far - as when he dismissed as 'peanuts' the DM50m owed by the collapsed Jurgen Schneider property group to trade creditors. The off-the-cuff remark, in the middle of a long press conference on the bank's role in Germany's biggest property bankruptcy since the second world war, prompted outrage in the tabloid press and introduced another English word into everyday use in Germany. The bank was lead creditor to Mr Jurgen Schneider, the property entrepreneur who disappeared after writing a letter to a Deutsche Bank board member in early April. At the press conference more than two weeks later the bank disclosed that it stopped lending to Schneider in 1992 and had started to intensify checks into Schneider's creditworthiness in February this year. But the bank was satisfied with his answers to their queries and with his payments record and had no suspicion that Mr Schneider was planning to abscond. The 'peanuts' observation - for which Mr Kopper later apologised - served to stir up the hostility of the general public to the big banks, so much so that polls showed a majority blaming the bank for the collapse of Schneider with debts of more than DM5bn - not Mr Schneider himself who has disappeared with several hundred million D-Marks of funds owed to craftsmen and building suppliers as well as banks. That hostility has found expression in the success of a second best-selling book from Mr Gunter Ogger, a business author who has an uncanny knack of identifying popular issues. His first book - Nieten in Madelstreifen (Nitwits in Pinstripes) - condemned Germany's managerial and banking elite for complacency and cosy boardroom connections. Before too long, the near-collapse of Metallgesellschaft, the large metals, mining and industrial group rescued in January - in which Deutsche Bank is a big shareholder - duly bore out his scathing criticisms. His second book is called Das Kartell der Kassierer (The Cartel of the Rip-off Merchants). It condemns Germany's bankers for stripping Germany's honest burghers of their hard-earned cash. In vain can heavyweight bankers such as Mr Kopper or Mr Martin Kohlhaussen, Commerzbank's chief executive, attempt to stem the tide of public opinion by arguing that German banks preserve jobs by rescuing German companies during recession - and that the solidity and profitability of the banking system in general is good for Germany. The strength of the German banks was illustrated in last year's results from Deutsche: group operating profits rose by 16 per cent to DM5.3bn. This was after making provisions for bad and doubtful debts. At Deutsche, provisions were increased 72 per cent to a massive DM3.3bn last year. It is in this context that Mr Kopper's 'peanuts' remark must be understood: the DM50m owed to Schneider's trade creditors is, indeed, immaterial in the context of the Deutsche Bank's own DM560bn balance sheet and its luxuriantly healthy profit-and-loss account. The bank's provisioning is substantial enough to swallow up the bank's unsecured exposure to the Schneider empire of DM500m, and more besides. Mr Kopper's public relations gaffe - and that of the bank in being slow to recognise the wider implications of the debacle from the moment that it was clear that Mr Schneider had left the country - was in failing to make a clear distinction between the implications for the bank, and the quite separate question of the impact on trade suppliers. That failure has left the bank's more junior employees out in the branch network facing anger and incomprehension from creditors harassed over much smaller amounts of money than the DM50m which counts as peanuts. 'But I can assure you that I and my colleagues know the value of DM50m,' Mr Kopper told disgruntled shareholders at the bank's annual meeting earlier this month. Whether the damage to the bank will be lasting, remains to be seen. Three separate investigations - one by the BAK federal banking authority and two internal ones - are under way and it is not impossible that heads will roll as a result. But despite a sharp fall in the share price in the immediate aftermath of the affair, most analysts continue to see Deutsche Bank shares as an attractive investment opportunity and the institution's formidable earnings power undented by embarrassment over the Schneider affair. The same is true for Germany's banking sector as a whole. Last year, one after another reported record profits despite large increases in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. At Dresdner Bank, profits were up by 24 per cent to DM2.04bn; at Commerzbank, by 24 per cent to DM1.13bn; Bayerische Vereinsbank, by 32 per cent to DM1.16bn and Hypo-Bank by 33 per cent to DM1.04bn. These figures reflect an extremely favourable constellation of circumstances  -falling interest rates, booming financial markets, strong demand for credit - which meant they could defy the deep recession in their home market. As bank chief executives acknowledged at this month's round of shareholder meetings, these circumstances no longer apply - the bund market has, for example, been in the doldrums throughout much of the early part of the current year. Although bank lending, at the core of mainstream banking business, continues to rise at a double-digit rate and provisions are on the way down, bankers predict that profits this year may be down from last year's record levels. Mr Kopper said that group operating profits after provisions were down at the Deutsche Bank by more than 10 per cent in the first four months of the current year. By contrast, Mr Jurgen Sarrazin, chief executive of the Dresdner Bank, said that profits rose at a pleasing rate over that period, but he warned about extrapolating the increase for the year as a whole. As the German economy starts to pull out of recession, it may be that the worst for the German banks is already over - and the worst constituted the best year in their history.</p>

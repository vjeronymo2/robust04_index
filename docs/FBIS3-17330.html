			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dmitriy Kuznets report under the "Drawing the Lines" </F> rubric: "Regions Demand Division of Powers"]    [Text] In Tambov, representatives of the regional  associations "Black Earth Region," "Siberian Accord," "Central  Region," "Northwest," "Northern Caucasus," and "The Urals"  signed yesterday a general agreement, compiled by themselves,  between the government and the above regional groups.    The document in the form of yet another petition is expected  to reach Viktor Chernomyrdin's desk soon. Should the Russian  premier add his signature to it, the regions would finally  secure a clear delimitation of powers of the Federation  components and the Federal government in the budget, taxation,  and foreign policy spheres.    The conference participants announced that the agreement  would replace the separate treaties each Federation component  has with the center. Sergey Shakhray, who attended the  conference and who is regarded, according to some information,  as the mastermind of the agreement, stated that the ideal option  would be for the oblast and local budgets to absorb up to 75  percent of the public revenues.    A draft agreement lobby was created in the form of a  coordination council which will "have its representatives in the  central organs of power and directly transfer to the regions the  powers they are going to procure." It is known from recent  history, however, that it is not going to be easy for the  regions to get the powers -- even despite the fact that Sergey  Shakhray is prepared to sacrifice for the agreement the  government careers of four ministers, members of the Party of  Russian Unity and Accord.</p>

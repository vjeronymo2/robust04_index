			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson dividend cut hits shares KING &amp; Shaxson Holdings, the discount house, has proposed cutting its dividend for the first time in its history following a halving in profit from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 920,000 after providing for rebate, tax and transfer from contingencies in the year to April 30. The final would be 2.5p for a total of 5p, against 10.25p. The shares lost 17p to close at 91p. Mr David Pearce, who became chairman following the death of Mr Billy D'Abbans in February, said it had been a troublesome period for the core discount house business. He added that during the year the pivotal role of the discount market as a provider of liquidity to the banking system had been eroded. 'We are normally in an uncomfortable vice between eligible bill yields that are forced too low and money costs that are pushed too high. It is for this reason that our holdings of money market instruments are approximately half that of a year ago.' The situation was unsatisfactory, he said, and the company was looking at further ways of reducing its dependence on the discount house. The results include those of Smith St Aubyn (Holdings), the discount house.</p>

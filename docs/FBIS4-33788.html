			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the NTV newscast] </F>   [Text] The CPC delegation headed by Wu Banggou, Politburo  member and CPC secretary in Shanghai, has visited Cienfuegos  Province. The delegation was greeted at the local government's  headquarters by Manuel Menendez Castellano, member of the  Central Committee and first secretary of the Communist Party of  Cuba [PCC] in the province, and other provincial authorities.    The delegation toured the Camilo Cienfuegos Refinery during  a  visit to the industrial park. The refinery is nearly completed  and has already been producing for the last three years. The  plant could benefit from an investment that would increase its  efficiency. The delegation also visited the Juragua Nuclear  Plant, where they were told that construction is temporarily  halted but that the facility has been preserved. The delegation  was also informed that negotiations recently got underway to  form an economic association that will make it possible to  complete the plant and start operations.    The delegation also met higher education teachers and  students in the province. The delegation will visit Matanzas  Province on 11 June and is scheduled to depart Cuba on 12 June.    This is the highest ranking PRC delegation to visit Cuba  since Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit.</p>

			<p>920925 FT  25 SEP 92 / International Company News: Snatching the future from the lap of luxury - Ian Rodger, Angus Foster and Philip Gawith scent success in Richemont's recent diversifications THESE DAYS, a sophisticated investor coming across an industrial group controlled by South Africans, with headquarters in Switzerland, dividends paid from a Luxembourg subsidiary and accounts presented in sterling, would almost certainly run the other way. Such a group would have the smell of what bankers burned by Mr Robert Maxwell and others now call 'the tycoon factor'. For most banks and investors that smell is not pleasant. But in the case of Richemont, the Rothmans tobacco and luxury products group controlled by the Rupert family of Cape Town, this suspicious-looking structure has a clear rationale and, so far, has been advantageous to all shareholders and, possibly, to employees as well. Attributable earnings last year of Pounds 197.3m (Dollars 331.4m) were double the 1989 level, and the bearer share more than trebled in value in that period to a peak of SFr16,375 (Dollars 12,596) earlier this year. Whether Richemont can maintain this pace remains to be seen. Mr Johann Rupert, its rather un-tycoon-like managing director, is doubtful, and warns shareholders of tough times ahead. 'We cannot manage the Richemont group of companies as if an economic disaster will occur. We do, however, manage it as if one might occur,' he wrote ominously in last year's annual report. Investors seem to have got the message because the shares have tumbled to the SFr12,000 level recently. Mr Rupert, now its driving force, is nervous about the prospects for luxury products in the recessionary 1990s and is diversifying the group into the mail order business and satellite television to participate in what he calls the franchises of the future. Until Richemont's 1988 launch, all the Rupert family's worldwide interests were owned ultimately by the quoted South African company, Rembrandt. But the family was worried about the risks of nationalisation in South Africa and ostracism from some western markets. Mr Rupert drew up and executed a plan for hiving off all the non-South African assets to Richemont, then a holding company for its Swiss interests. Since Rothmans International of the UK formed a large part of the new group's assets, it made sense to keep Richemont's accounts in sterling. Since most of the shareholders were in South Africa, it did not make sense to have dividends paid by the Swiss company. Switzerland has a 35 per cent withholding tax. Hence the Luxembourg subsidiary. Richemont's strong earnings performance has been buttressed by steady results from Rothmans and buoyed by the 1980s boom in luxury products. Its portfolio includes such gems as the French Cartier Monde group (77 per cent owned), Alfred Dunhill (36 per cent) and the Swiss watchmakers Baume &amp; Mercier and G. Piaget (65 per cent). Mr Rupert has an ambivalent attitude towards the luxury goods business. While he believes in brands and that they must be built up and supported over a long period, he is nervous about how they will fare in a recession. 'I have been preparing shareholders for four years to recognise that the 38 per cent average annual growth we had over nine years is not sustainable. But the business has been remarkably resilient in the past two years,' he says. 'I would not have believed it. A French friend tells me that once people use real silk and high-quality leathers they never go back. I hope he is right.' Richemont has continued to acquire luxury goods lines and Mr Rupert says he will buy more if the price is right. He has also shown he is not willing to sell a luxury goods business, even at a spectacular price. Three years ago, he was approached by an intermediary for Japanese investors ready to pay Dollars 6bn for Cartier. At the time, that represented a staggering 40 times earnings. 'I laughed at him, I was convinced it was not a serious offer,' Mr Rupert recalls ruefully. Three months later, he discovered that it had been serious, but it was too late. 'Obviously on financial grounds, in a case like that you should sell. But, on the other hand, we do not buy and sell companies. We try to build up long-term relationships with our companies. 'I did not want to leave our people at Cartier in the lurch. I told them about the offer a few months later, and they laughed at me and told me I had been stupid. But what would we have replaced it with?' In the past two years, Mr Rupert has been restructuring Rothmans' tobacco business and finding new businesses for Richemont. Rothmans International, in which Richemont has a 62.5 per cent holding, accounted for 70 per cent of group sales and 63 per cent of operating profit last year. However, Rothmans' main markets are in western Europe, North America and Australia, where demand and profits have been declining. In Canada and Australia, it has only minority stakes in the quoted operating companies, and performance in Australia in particular has deteriorated. A new chief executive has been installed at Rothmans International in London and the group is setting up a 'more integrated form of management structure'. It is concentrating on Asia, and Mr Rupert admits a priority is to develop a flagship American blend cigarette, something the group lacks but the market wants. The Ruperts' first international investments outside tobacco and luxury goods in the mid-1980s were in TransAtlantic, a holding company for 25 per cent of Sun Life Assurance of the UK and 75 per cent of Capital &amp; Counties, and in North American Resources, a speculative oil and gas venture. These followed the family's preferred pattern of taking on partners for its businesses. 'We like partners, and we are known as management friendly,' Mr Rupert says. The TransAtlantic stake was sold last year for a Pounds 33.7m profit, while North American, in which Richemont has a 50 per cent stake, is distancing itself from oil and gas and concentrating on Horn and Hardart, the former New York fast food company that became a mail order business. North American rescued Horn and Hardart last year from a failed leveraged buyout and is in the process of refinancing it. Cash-flow is said to be very high, and Mr Rupert, who is not given to optimistic forecasts, predicts it will soon become the number one direct retailer in the US. Whether this will form the proverbial third leg that Richemont appears to want is not clear. Mr Rupert seems restless and argues the company should keep trying to update its product portfolio. 'My job is to snatch bits of the future and try to position the company in areas where it can manufacture products that my children will be interested in,' he says. He dislikes high-technology products. 'You have to invest so much to keep up. When do you cash out? I would like to buy real franchises, but we cannot afford ones that have already been built up, like Coca Cola. So we try to build little franchises.' His latest purchase, together with a South African media group, was the Scandinavian satellite television company, FilmNet. Each party paid Dollars 75m for 50 per cent stakes, and they have recently sold 10 per cent to RTL 4, the Luxembourg broadcasting group. FilmNet, set up in 1985, provides a subscription television service to Belgium, the Netherlands and in Scandinavia. It concentrated initially on pornographic and violent films and was not a success. Mr Rupert says he became enthusiastic about satellite television after studying Britain's BSkyB. The key, he says, is to have control of subscriber decoders. This enables the operator ultimately to negotiate with producers to charge customers for individual programmes. 'It is the box office of the future,' he says. He cheerfully admits that it will be a long haul, but has already taken the first step by getting rid of the pornography. EVEN if you like Richemont, its shares tend always to be more expensive than those of comparable tobacco or luxury products groups. This is because South African investors, who have access to the shares through a depositary arrangement, are willing to pay a premium for them as a hedge against the rand. South African investors also tend to hang on to the shares, which means that there is very little liquidity in them in their home market of Switzerland. This is more than a minor inconvenience for Swiss investors because Richemont is one of the largest Swiss quoted companies, with a market capitalisation of nearly SFr7bn, and figures in the SMI index of leading shares. Next month, following the implementation in July of a revision to Swiss company law, Richemont will join many Swiss companies in splitting its bearer shares 10-for-one, although analysts doubt that this will make much difference to the liquidity. The group also seems to have taken to heart the trend among Swiss companies to be more transparent about its activities, and has published a highly detailed 60 page report for 1991. But Mr Johann Rupert, chairman, says there is no intention to change the two-class share structure under which his family has voting control with only 10 per cent of the share capital. Mr Rupert says the Rembrandt minority shareholders unanimously endorsed the family's lopsided voting power when the overseas assets were hived off to Richemont. Occasional rumours that Richemont might consolidate and spin off its luxury products subsidiaries, some of which are owned partly by Rothmans, into a separate group, are also misplaced. 'There is certainly a sound managerial reason for doing it, but I have not found a tax effective way,' Mr Rupert says. The key problem is that any restructuring would trigger capital gains tax on the Cartier business, now worth substantially more than Richemont paid for it.</p>

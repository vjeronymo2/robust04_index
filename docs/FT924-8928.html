			<p>921109 FT  09 NOV 92 / Compromise on trade urged as EC tensions rise: EC commissioner calls for concessions US AND European Community negotiators must make fresh compromises in their farm trade dispute if trade war is to be averted, Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, warned yesterday. Mr Andriessen said on British television that neither the EC nor the US was entitled to let the Uruguay Round fail. He said differences 'while not insubstantial, can be breached'. The call for further compromises from the EC's chief trade negotiator could fuel controversy at an EC foreign ministers' meeting in Brussels today, where France will ask for a hit-list to be drawn up of US farm exports that could be triggered if the US goes ahead with threats to slap 200 per cent tariffs on European white wine and other imports. French demands for retaliation were fended off at the weekend during an informal two-day meeting of EC trade ministers at Brocket Hall, north-west of London, with German and British ministers calling for a quick return to the negotiating table. France claims it has support from Ireland, Spain and Belgium. UK officials in Brussels indicated that ministers would today stop short of a decision on retaliatory measures against the US, but Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, will appeal for Community solidarity on the issue. 'We will certainly have to give away something more,' Mr Andriessen said on Dutch television. 'The US will also have to be a bit more obliging.' He warned that France must be careful not to become isolated within the EC in its fight to block settlement of a long-standing dispute with the US over Europe's oilseeds subsidy regime. He refused to say whether the EC should draw up a retaliation list, saying only that today's meeting of EC foreign ministers would 'discuss how to deal with the totality of the issue'. Negotiations to settle the dispute - which is at the heart of a wider US-EC row over Europe's farm subsidy regime - have for two years blocked progress towards a comprehensive world trade reform package that could stimulate an additional Dollars 200bn (Pounds 129bn) a year in international trade. Talks collapsed in Chicago on Tuesday as farm ministers from both sides sought a last-ditch settlement ahead of the US presidential election. The US swiftly announced it would impose 200 per cent tariffs on farm products worth Dollars 300m if the dispute were not settled in 30 days. Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, French industry and foreign trade minister, maintained that France was acting on behalf of all 12 EC governments in asking Brussels to prepare counter sanctions, which should start with soya. He added that France had 'numerous allies' including Spain, Belgium and Ireland 'who like us refuse to submit'. Mr Michael Heseltine, UK trade and industry secretary, talked yesterday of a wide range of dialogue going on behind the scenes at the weekend aimed at 'cooling the temperature'. He said Mr John Major, president of the EC, was 'doubling every effort to get talks back on the road.' 'The clock is ticking. It is a very dangerous situation,' he said.

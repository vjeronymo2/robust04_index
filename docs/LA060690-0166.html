			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> U.S. SOCCER TEAM INTENDS TO GET DOWN AND DIRTY  </P> <P> Even though the U.S. soccer team went to church today, the theme of the day was  no more Mr. Nice Guys.  </P> <P> Before taping promotional spots for MTV and visiting the Basilica of the  Madonna at the Montenero Sanctuary, the team worked out in the rain and talked  about the need to get tough -- and even play dirty.  </P> <P> "We're too clean, myself included," forward Bruce Murray said. "As a team, we  have to get mean and aggressive. I know a lot of that comes with maturity on  the field, knowing when to give up a professional foul if pressed, when to just  step in and hip check and stuff."  </P> <P> Professional fouls? Hip checks?  </P> <P> "I don't think it's a matter of retaliating," U.S. Coach Bob Gansler said.  "It's just a matter of asserting your manhood out there, as well. We certainly  have come a way from (the days when) after a hard play we'd look at the referee  and say, 'What's going on here?' "  </P> <P> Peter Vermes, likely to start at forward along with Murray in Sunday's game  against Czechoslovakia, has played in Hungary and the Netherlands and knows the  way things go.  </P> <P> "When you come over to Europe and start to play as an American player, you have  to learn in three weeks to a month the tricks of the trade that these players  over here have been learning for their whole lives," Vermes said.  </P> <P> And what, exactly, are those?  </P> <P> "Nothing major where you really hurt someone," Vermes said. "Just get the foul.  Slow the game down. Begin again."  </P> <P> Or, as Murray put it: "Sometimes you have to lay in the heavy tackle and set  the tone. Let the other guy know that, next time, you're in for more."  </P> <P> That's exactly what FIFA, soccer's governing body, is trying to prevent.  </P> <P> "I think the intentions are good," Gansler said of FIFA's directive for strict  refereeing. "But even though you set the guidelines, you still have different  individuals out there, in terms of referees, that are going to have the  jurisdiction."  </P> <P> Murray said he prefers strict enforcement.  </P> <P> "That might work to our advantage," he said, "because a lot of these teams are  going to think, 'Let's see if we can intimidate them.' And if they're going to  try that stuff from behind, well, then we're going to be hopefully protected by  the referees. If not, then maybe matters might have to be taken into their own  hands."  </P> <P> After the morning practice, Paul Caligiuri, Desmond Armstrong, Jimmy Banks and  Eric Eichmann sang for the MTV camera.  </P> <P> There was no singing at the Montenero Sanctuary, set on a picturesque hilltop  outside Livorno. The church was opened in 1575 and is dedicated to an alleged  sighting of the Madonna at Livorno on May 15, 1345.  </P> <P> Joe Machnick, the team's goal-keeping coach, said if the Americans advance to  the second round, he would crawl from Tirrenia to the church as an act of  thanks.  </P></p>

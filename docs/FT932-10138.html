			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Wasmosy wins in Paraguay's presidential poll: The first civilian leader for almost 50 years PARAGUAY remains Colorado country. Voters on Sunday elected Mr Juan Carlos Wasmosy of the Colorado party for a five-year term as head of state. Paraguay's first civilian president for almost 50 years will after all come from the party of General Alfredo Stroessner, the dictator of 34 years deposed in a 1989 coup. Riven by dispute between those faithful to Gen Stroessner's legacy and its more modern wing backing Mr Wasmosy, 55, the party never-theless managed to mobilise enough support to secure victory thanks to the loyalty of voters in the countryside. The official Central Electoral Board projected yesterday that Mr Wasmosy would win 40 per cent of the vote, Mr Domingo Laino, of the Authentic Liberal Radical party (PLRA), would gain 33 per cent and Mr Guillermo Caballero Vargas, of the pro-business Encuentro Nacional coalition, 22.8 per cent. Although the 200 international observers, led by former US president Jimmy Carter, reported some electoral irregularities, they said these were not systematic and did not affect the vote's outcome. Mr Wasmosy - the name is Hungarian - is an engineer, cattle rancher and cotton farmer. A member of the Colorado party for 20 years, he made his fortune in part from sizeable contracts for the Paraguayan-Brazilian Itaipu Dam. One of his tasks as president will be to renegotiate the deal with Brazil on Itaipu, a Stroessner-sponsored project notorious for corruption. Mr Wasmosy has the support of Gen Andres Rodriguez, who led the coup that ousted Gen Stroessner, and the upper echelons of the army. His democratic credentials have been marred by the way in which he achieved the presidential nomination in the Colorado primary elections in December. His victory over the pro-Stroessner candidate Mr Luis Maria Argana was, according to the US National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, won by 'questionable, if not outright fraudulent means'. However it almost certainly averted a coup by army leaders who assisted in toppling Gen Stroessner. Mr Argana's campaign description of Mr Wasmosy as a closet liberal underlined the relatively small policy differences among the three presidential candidates. Mr Wasmosy is expected to support market-oriented economic policies and increase the economy's outward orientation. Mr Wasmosy, who takes over in August, will not have things entirely his own way, however. The Colorados will be the largest party but will not have a majority in either house of congress, where the PLRA ran them a close second; support from other parties will be needed to push through legislation. After nearly half a century of military rule, the institutions of the Colorado party, the army and the state are inextricably intertwined. The military, however, may see the chief benefit of the victory of their candidate as security for their budget, which accounts for a fifth of government expenditure and is outside congressional or presidential oversight. The Rodriguez government has already embarked on a policy of privatisation. British Aerospace, for example, is examining the possibility of acquiring Lapsa, the state airline which leases some of the UK company's aircraft. The military, which manages most important state industries, could provide strong opposition to this policy. However the army is increasingly subject to external constraints: senior officers are now regularly attacked in the press and the opening of secret police files has led to charges of human rights violations. Whether these constraints will increase over the next five years or whether the military will maintain its hold on the state is the key question of Mr Wasmosy's term of office.</p>

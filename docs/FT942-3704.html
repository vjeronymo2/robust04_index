			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Murdoch cut BBC to please China Mr Rupert Murdoch, chairman of News Corporation, has finally admitted that he kicked BBC World Service Television off his Star TV system in Asia to please the Chinese government and help establish the satellite service there. In an interview with Mr William Shawcross, author of a Murdoch biography, for Esquire magazine, Mr Murdoch conceded he had perhaps taken the action 'a bit too easily because of my feelings for the BBC'. Mr Murdoch also argued that it was pointless doing any broadcasting in Asia except in local languages. But he accepted that those arguments did not meet the main criticisms that had been made of him in an editorial in the International Herald Tribune. 'There's no answer to it. They say it's a cowardly way, but we said in order to get in there and get accepted, we'll cut the BBC out,' said the News Corporation chairman. The BBC agreed to go off the northern beam of the Star TV system which covers Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan before its contract ran out at the end of this year.</p>

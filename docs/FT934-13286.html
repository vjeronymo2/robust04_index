			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Technology: Shopping around for a new store design - Worth Watching Years of research into video image processing could now give retailers valuable information to help them re-design the layout of their stores. Retail design consultancy ID Magasin is using Spytrack, adapted from a surveillance system by EDS Scicon, to analyse how shoppers move around a store. Spytrack uses standard video cameras to record the images in the store. These are then transferred on to a PC where the software processes the images, calculating traffic flows, areas of congestion, cold spots and so on. EDS Scicon: UK, 0276 686200.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ludmila Yermakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 3 June -- Money has been allocated for cargo  to northern regions, and the transportation of goods has already  begun, Vice Prime Minister Sergey Shakhray, who is in charge of  a commission entrusted to regulate transportation, told  ITAR-TASS. He said that one trillion rubles over the next two  months has been allocated for the transportation of cargo. The  task in this period is to supply only those areas with a limited  navigation season with only petroleum products, coal, and four  types of food.    According to the State Duma's deputy, parliamentary hearings  held in April in the two chambers helped to resolve this issue.  They also showed that a new legislative basis was needed for  these regions. "Random market relations in the north will not  produce any good results on their own. State regulatory  measures are needed," he stressed.    The participants in today's hearings in the Federation  Council on social-economic and cultural issues came to similar  conclusions, the deputy noted. "Everyone is convinced that the  transformation to free market relations is a noose around the  neck of indigenous peoples," he pointed out. Venison and other  traditional foodstuffs prices have nothing to do with the market  relations. That is why they need state subsidies. This will be  less expensive than moving the northerners to towns. Sergey  Shakhray recalled that in Canada and in Alaska, in spite of the  market, state regulation of prices is tight.    He pointed out that "the development of resources in the  north is an issue of maintaining the ethnic composition of the  area." That is why one of the conditions for granting contracts  for the development of the natural resources will be making  deductions set by the law for protecting the habitat and forms  of local economic forms.</p>

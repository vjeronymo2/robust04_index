			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Move to cut carbon emissions - Fuel Tax This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. VALUE ADDED tax is to be applied to domestic fuel from April 1 next year, and road fuel tax is to rise in real terms in future Budgets, as part of measures to encourage more efficient use of fuels and reduce emissions of carbon dioxide. The chancellor said VAT would apply to domestic fuel and power at a rate of 8 per cent from April 1994 and 17 1/2 per cent from April 1995. He also gave a commitment to increase road fuel duties by, on average, at least 3 per cent in real terms in future Budgets, building on the 10 per cent increase announced in this Budget. The Treasury said: 'His intention is to make a major contribution to the UK's programme for limiting carbon dioxide emissions. This programme follows the signature by the prime minister of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change at Rio last year.' Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said: 'Taken together with measures that have already been announced, the UK now has in place policies which should take us two thirds of the way to meeting the Climate Change Convention commitments for carbon dioxide emissions, agreed at Rio. We expect to ratify the Convention, together with other major countries, by the end of 1993.'</p>

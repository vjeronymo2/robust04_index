			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Italian ministers in threat to quit The Italian government was further undermined yesterday by the prospect of ministers from the populist Northern League resigning in advance of tomorrow's no-confidence vote in parliament. At least three of the five League ministers said they preferred to resign their portfolios before voting against the right-wing coalition of which they formed part. Mr Giancarlo Pagliarini, finance minister, went further and became the first minister to criticise openly Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian premier, by claiming 'he lacked the ability to run the government'. But Mr Berlusconi still won support  - albeit lukewarm  - from Mr Roberto Maroni, interior minister and the most influential League figure in the cabinet. Backers of Mr Umberto Bossi, the League leader, were gathering signatures from among the deputies within the movement yesterday to check those willing to vote against the government. Mr Bossi has tested the loyalty of a sizeable number of deputies by turning towards the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) as a potential ally. Others are concerned that, since their election was due to strong backing from Mr Berlusconi's Forza Italia movement, they cannot easily break this link without betraying the electorate. However, the League is aware that the government has little chance of survival. The party's stance will be crucial for the eight-month-old government in the three no-confidence motions due to be debated on consecutive days. The financial markets registered their concern over the increasing instability by forcing the lira to fall close to another psychological barrier  - L1,050 to the D-Mark.</p>

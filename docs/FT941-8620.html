			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: Swedbank losses narrow to SKr3.66bn Losses at Swedbank, the Nordic region's largest bank in asset terms, narrowed sharply last year, helped by tough cost-cutting and reduced credit losses. Operating losses amounted to SKr3.66bn (Dollars 456m), SKr300m better than forecast and SKr8.1bn lower than 1992's SKr11.75bn deficit. Mr Goran Collert, chief executive, said the performance signalled the bank was on the road to recovery, with good prospects of a positive result in 1994. He said Swedbank would be seeking a stock market listing in the spring of 1995, subject to market conditions. The main reason for the improved result was a sharp reduction in loan losses to SKr11.7bn, or 3 per cent of group lending, from SKr18.5bn a year earlier. The corporate sector remained the chief source of problems, accounting for 87 per cent of total write-offs. A 2 per cent increase in revenues to SKr16.3bn and an 11 per cent drop in expenses to SKr8.3bn also contributed to the recovery. Costs have been cut by SKr1.5bn since 1991, following heavy reductions in personnel. Last year the bank cut the number of full-time jobs by 1,330. Net problem loans were also easing, the bank said. During 1993 they fell 20 per cent to end the year at SKr18.8bn, or 4.7 per cent of lending. The bank will soon launch a SKr2.2bn share issue as part of plans to rebuild its capital base without state support. The stock exchange listing is designed to broaden the group's ownership structure, while reducing the dominance of the 11 savings bank foundations which are currently its main shareholders. The long-term aim is for the savings bank sector and Swedish/foreign institutions each to own 40 per cent of the bank's shares and customers the remaining 20 per cent.</p>

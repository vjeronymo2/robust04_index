			<p>920317 FT  17 MAR 92 / Foreign Exchanges: All quiet on the dollar front THE foreign exchanges appeared reluctant to move on any currency yesterday, with most units trading in a narrow range, reports Peggy Hollinger. The dollar was consolidating after recent gains, to close at DM1.6655, compared with a previous DM1.6665. The lack of statistics out of the US gave traders little incentive to find new positions on the dollar, said Mr Nick Parsons, head of the treasury advisory group at CIBC. Strong resistance at DM1.6720 was expected to hold for the short term. However, he argued, there remained an underlying bid sentiment to the dollar market. The lack of inspiration in the dollar market was being attributed to the signs of recovery now being seen in the US economy. Recovery had already been priced in, said Dr Mark Austin, economist at HongKong Bank, and now the market was unsure of its next moves. 'There is a risk the dollar will drift off unless there are exceptional numbers from the US,' he said. Sterling took some support from the Labour Party's budget proposals, which included a strong commitment to the exchange rate mechanism. Rumours that a 15 tick jump in sterling in the afternoon was the result of Bank of England intervention were unsubstantiated. Mr David Simmonds, chief treasury economist at Midland Montagu, dismissed the intervention speculation and said there had been nothing unusual in the jump. Sterling closed a touch stronger at DM2.8575, compared with DM2.8550, and at Dollars 1.7155, against a previous close of Dollars 1.7125. Traders said the prospects for sterling were on the downside this week, with Thursday's unemployment figures not likely to boost support for the Conservative Party. Furthermore, speculation about a UK rate cut was likely to resurface this week with the retail price index out on on Friday. The RPI figures were expected to show UK inflation below Germany's, perhaps opening a window of opportunity for a rate cut. After Thursday's unemployment figures, the government could well be desperate for some good news for the Tory party campaigners to carry to the voters, said Mr Parsons. 'It is no more than an outside chance,' he said, 'but it is a chance.' Within the ERM, sterling traded close to its limit against the peseta for most of the day. The yen came under pressure following the Nikkei's tumble to five-year lows, and weakened against the dollar, sterling and D-Mark. The Japanese currency weakened from Y133.55 to Y133.95 per dollar, from Y228.75 to Y229.75 per pound and from DM1.2493 per 100 yen to DM1.2420. Investors in the South African financial rand would be anxiously awaiting the results of the all-white referendum, expected on Wednesday, said Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays. The financial rand would need a 'resounding yes vote on a good turnout' if it was to avoid a sharp tumble, he added.</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Pilkington cuts dividend and sees no pick-up PILKINGTON, the glass maker, slashed its dividend yesterday and warned that it could not see any sign of a recovery in trading conditions. The dividend cut was the first since Pilkington went public in 1970. Sir Antony Pilkington, chairman, said that trading conditions 'have been the worst anyone can remember'. Pilkington's main customers are the building and automotive industries; both important indicators of the economy's health. Sir Antony said that in neither the UK nor in the US could he see 'the mechanism to start a recovery'. His comments contributed to the fall in the stock market. Pilkington shares fell 3p to 129p, but have fallen from 164p in early May as the City began to anticipate a dividend cut and BTR, which once bid for Pilkington, sold its 4.1 per cent stake. 'There is unprecedented uncertainty about the timing, nature and strength of recovery,' Sir Antony said. Pilkington incurred a pre-tax loss in its UK business in the year to March 31. Overall, group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 151.6m to Pounds 77m, after exceptional costs of Pounds 37m. In December, Pilkington maintained its first interim dividend at 2.93p. It hoped to hold the second payment at 7.57p. Yesterday, however, it was cut to 3.07p. That gives a total of 6p for the year; a 43 per cent reduction, even then not covered by earnings per share of 5.5p before the exceptional costs. This is the third year of falling profits at Pilkington. In 1988-89 pre-tax profits were Pounds 325m. Until now the group has continued to pay the dividend set in 1990, even though the 1990-91 earnings were not sufficient to cover the cost. Sir Antony said that normally the cyclical nature of the group's business meant it would pay an uncovered dividend in difficult years, adding that 'there is a limit to the time we can pay a severely uncovered dividend'. Chancellor Norman Lamont yesterday played down the significance of critical remarks attributed to Sir Antony, writes David Owen. Mr Lamont said Sir Antony, who was reported to have accused the chancellor of 'killing' domestic industry, had assured him he wholly supported government policy.

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RERUNS TO RE-WATCH;  </P> <P> ED GOES TO BAT FOR THE DODGERS  </P> <P> So, you think that all Mr. Ed can do is talk?  </P> <P> You must be thinking of some other talking horse. This one has been a  successful businessman, an artist and a spy.  </P> <P> He can even teach the Los Angeles Dodgers a thing or two, which he does on "Mr.  Ed" at 11 p.m. Friday on Nickelodeon.  </P> <P> Ed, pretending he's Wilbur, calls Dodgers Coach Leo Durocher with tips to solve  some of the team's batting problems. When the advice works, Wilbur is invited  to a practice session to give him more. Ed, being the brains in the Post  household, comes along to coach Wilbur coach the players.  </P> <P> At Dodger Stadium, Ed shows once again that he's not all talk. By the end of  practice, you'll be wishing Tommy Lasorda had him around last year.  </P> <P> In another tie-in with a local sports team, Los Angeles Rams lineman Deacon  Jones helps Peter discover that it's OK for macho men to sing on "The Brady  Bunch" (1:35 p.m. Tuesday on TBS).  </P></p>

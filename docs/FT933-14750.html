			<p>930713 FT  13 JUL 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Understanding the issues  -Charles Batchelor continues his series answering questions on the European single market The Growing Business Page's Single Market Q&amp;A series is intended to allow readers to raise issues prompted by the formal launch of the single European market on January 1, 1993. In theory the barriers have come down in Europe, but in practice doing business across borders can be complex and time consuming. Merits of a pan-European title Q: In your last Single Market Q&amp;A you explained how EC legislation on the compatibility of professional qualifications would allow a British chartered engineer to register in Germany. We are consulting civil and structural engineers and are currently evaluating a number of projects in Germany. A few years ago all chartered engineers were encouraged to register as European Engineers and were rewarded with the qualification Eur. Ing. Does this qualification carry any real weight? Is it sufficient to guarantee acceptance on the official list of approved engineers at the regional chambers of architects (Architektenkammer). A: The Eur. Ing. title is a pan-European title for chartered engineers operating in Europe, though it is not covered by EC legislation on the freedom of establishment of professionals (89/48/EEC). It confers no extra privileges but its value lies in the fact that it is a readily recognisable professional qualification Europe-wide. More than 15,000 professional engineers in Europe currently hold the title, with some 300 applying every month. Although the Eur. Ing. title may only be obtained by qualified chartered engineers it is not sufficient to guarantee acceptance on the official list of approved engineers at the regional chambers of architects. VAT reporting requirements queried Q: I have recently set up a business and will shortly start exporting to other EC member states. What are the present VAT reporting requirements in the UK? A: UK VAT registered businesses are required to provide Customs and Excise with EC Sales Lists (ESLs), on a quarterly basis, for all sales to other VAT registered businesses in the Community. These lists itemise sales by values and VAT registration numbers of buyers. They are required by Customs at the end of each calender quarter - March, June, September and December. However, small businesses with an annual turnover of less than Pounds 62,000 and sales not exceeding Pounds 11,500 in the EC may be exempted from providing ESLs. This is discretionary and you should seek guidance from your Customs office. Businesses with exports exceeding Pounds 135,000 a year to the EC must also provide Supplementary Sales Declarations (SSDs) on a calender month basis. These reports must list a minimum of eight items of transaction data, for example, delivery term and mode of transport, for each sale. Importers who exceed the Pounds 135,000 threshold for EC purchases must also provide SSDs, the information for which is used to compile European Community trade statistics known as Intrastats. A green approach to labelling Q: I have heard there is a label which states that my products are environmentally sound. How can I obtain such a label and what are the objectives of the scheme? A: The label to which you refer is the EC Ecolabel which demonstrates that your product has the minimum adverse impact on the environment. To apply for an Ecolabel contact one of the national organisations set up to administer the scheme. In the UK it is: UK Ecolabelling Board, 7th Floor, Eastbury House, 30-34 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TL. Tel: 071 820 1199. Fax: 071 820 1104. The purpose of the voluntary scheme is to promote the design, production, marketing and use of products that have the least impact on the environment. The Ecolabel also aims to encourage the production of more environmentally benign products. EC working groups have started to devise Ecolabelling criteria for a range of products, including washing machines, based on their environmental performance throughout their life cycle. Once the Ecolabelling organisation has decided to award a label it notifies the European Commission. The Commission then informs interest groups in other member states. After 30 days the Ecolabelling body may award the label, provided there are no objections from either the Commission or another member state. If objections are not resolved within a further 15 days the proposed award will be submitted to the Commission's Regulatory Committee for a decision. A contract is drawn up between the Ecolabelling authority and the applicant. Notice of the award is published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. The Ecolabelling authority in the UK charges an application fee of Pounds 500 including VAT. An annual license fee of 0.15 per cent plus VAT is also payable. This is based on the volume of sales of the product within the member states at ex-factory prices. Fees will vary slightly between member states. This subject is covered by the EC regulation on the Community Ecolabel award scheme (880/92) and applies to all products except for pharmaceuticals, beverages and foodstuffs. Directives affect UK employees abroad Q: I intend shortly to establish a subsidiary in France and will be posting at least one member of staff there. In the light of the UK's recent abstention from the vote on the EC directive on 'Working Time', what will be the position of a UK worker in France? A: Although your employees will still be working for a British company, they will be based in France and will be subject to French national legislation as well as any relevant EC regulations and directives in force. Once the 'Working Time' directive has been formally adopted in France all employees working for French, UK or other companies will have the legal right to: A minimum daily rest period of 11 consecutive hours At least one day off a week Four weeks annual paid holiday A restriction on night work to a maximum of an average of eight hours. The Commission has recommended the length of nightworking be averaged over 14 days but has left a final decision to the individual member states Mandatory daily rest breaks after six hours. These conditions will apply in all EC member states except the UK. However, the directive allows for exemptions if your company is involved in the fishery, agriculture, offshore and transport industries. Community workers will still be able to work more than 48 hours a week voluntarily if safeguards to prevent abuse are in place. The UK's abstention will therefore have no real affect on your staff in France. Help with language courses Q: I am a UK citizen living and working in Germany and would like to enrol on a German language course. Can I apply for a grant, loan or tax relief on such a course? A: There are no grants, loans or tax relief available for individuals wanting to pursue language training in Germany. But there are regional promotion programmes designed to help German companies prepare and develop their employees for working in the single market. These programmes do not exist in every Land and the conditions and benefits vary according to the development strategies of the region. On a Community level, the increased trade, mobility and cultural exchange which has resulted from the development of the internal market has led to the introduction of the Lingua programme. This is an EC initiative which promotes a more widespread understanding and use of the Community languages. It is not a programme targeted directly at business, although the aim is to promote foreign language skills in the workforce. For further information contact The UK Lingua Unit, Seymour Mews House, Seymour Mews, London WlH 9PE. Tel: 071 725 9493 Fax: 071 224 1906. The European headquarters of the programme is at Bureau Lingua, 10 rue du Commerce, B-1040 Brussels. Tel: 322 511 42 18 Fax: 322 511 43 76.

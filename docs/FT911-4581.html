			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Fall in numbers on waiting lists - Health Service THE FALL in the number of people waiting for treatment in national health service hospitals in the six months to September last year, was welcomed by Mr William Waldegrave, the health secretary, in a Commons debate yesterday. The number of people on the in-patient waiting list was 705,000 - down 1 per cent on the total for March - while the figures for people on the day-case waiting list had dropped by 1 per cent to 200,700. Mr Waldegrave said yesterday's figures showed that good progress was being made, and referred particularly to the drop of 5,100 in the total number of people waiting more than a year. 'The latest provisional figures from regional health authorities indicate that this progress is gaining momentum, with a 12 per cent reduction expected in the five months from September 1990 to February this year,' he said. But Mr Robin Cook, the shadow health secretary, said that the total was still the highest for any September since records had begun, and said that there had also been a reduction in the level of patient activity. Opening an opposition-led debate on the health service, Mr Cook claimed that the government might begin to manipulate the statistics as it had done the figures for unemployment. In future fewer people might be accepted on to waiting lists, he said.</p>

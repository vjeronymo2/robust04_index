			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Tussle starts for leadership: Japanese opposition chief seen as failing to attack LDP THE Social Democratic party of Japan, the country's largest opposition party, yesterday began the difficult process of choosing a new chairman to replace Mr Makoto Tanabe, who resigned in the face of criticism that he failed to attack the ruling Liberal Democratic party. The SDPJ, formerly known as the Japan Socialist party, has been unable to capitalise on the weakness of the LDP even though Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has a public approval rating of only 14 per cent as measured by newspaper opinion polls. Mr Tanabe, a right-winger, was condemned by younger SDPJ members for allowing close personal ties to Mr Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather' of the LDP, to undermine opposition attacks against the ruling party's links to gangsters and its involvement in an illegal donations scandal. The most likely successor is Mr Sadao Yamahana, 56, a left-winger and secretary general for the past year, who announced his candidacy yesterday and is hoping other factions will agree that he should take the post, avoiding the need for a potentially embarrassing vote by party members. Mr Yamahana, like Mr Tanabe and before him Ms Takako Doi, will face the painful task of dragging the party towards the middle ground, and providing Japanese voters with a genuine alternative to the scandal-tainted LDP. 'We must build a political party suitable for a new era,' Mr Yamahana said. 'I hope to play a role in building the new party.' Similar statements were frequently made by Mr Tanabe, but his reform attempts were blocked by the more ideological members of its extreme left wing, which supports the dictatorship of Kim Il Sung in North Korea and does not recognise the Japanese defence forces. The Japan Communist party yesterday expelled its former chairman, Mr Sanzo Nosaka, 100, for falsely accusing his then colleague, Mr Kenzo Yamamoto, of spying, leading to his execution in Moscow in 1939. The decision, not contested by Mr Nosaka, followed a study of newly opened archives in Russia.</p>

			<p>920819 FT  19 AUG 92 / UK Company News: CGS denies report on Hoskyns' buy Cap Gemini Sogeti, the computing services group, yesterday denied a report in a London newspaper which alleged the company's purchase of the remaining shares in Hoskyns Group, the UK-based computer company, was under review. CGS bought 69.5 per cent of Hoskyns from GEC/Siemens in 1990 and said it would offer to buy the remaining shares in 1993. Mr Michel Jalabert, CGS president, said the company had 'every intention' of honouring its earlier commitment. In a statement, he said Hoskyns' shareholders will be offered 'not less than 469p per share'. Hoskyns' shares closed up 1p at 439p. Mr Jalabert said the offer would be made within three months after Hoskyns releases preliminary results, due in mid-December.</p>

			<p>940812 FT  12 AUG 94 / People: Tommy Hilfinger Corporation Clinton Silver, 64, who stepped down as deputy chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer at the end of last month, has joined the board of Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, a fast-growing US company which specialises in designing and marketing sportswear for men and boys. Tommy Hilfiger, the principal designer and honorary chairman, was a small-town boy who went to New York as a freelance designer in 1979 and has been likened to Ralph Lauren. He founded the company in 1989 with financial backing from Apparel International Holdings, which is now the company's majority shareholder. The company's shares were floated on the New York Stock Exchange in September 1992 and have more than doubled in value. The company's revenues rose 64 per cent to Dollars 227m in its last financial year and Tommy Hilfiger products are sold through 480 in-store shops. Silver (above), who spent 42 years at Marks and Spencer, will help guide the company's long-term plans for international expansion in Europe and the Far East.</p>

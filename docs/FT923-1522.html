			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Arts: Focus on avenging honour - Television So what then happened? Did grizzled old Isak at last save his honour by killing young Fazli or some hapless male relative? Or did Isak instead yield to the combined pressure of his village hodja and a bunch of intellectuals from the city, and agree to 'forgive the blood'? It is a mark of just how good Forgiving the Blood (Friday, BBC 2) was that it has left me burning to know how it all ended. But art mirrored life all too closely in this compelling documentary by Melissa Llewelyn-Davies, first part of a trilogy called 'Tribes of Europe'. (Germans and Scots are yet to come.) No one knows how it will end in Kosovo, the former Yugoslav territory ruled by Serbia. Isak and Fazli are (although in the latter's case the past tense might be more apt) ethnic Albanians who outnumber Serbs seven to one. However, as a group of Serbian Orthodox monks explained, Kosovo is regarded as the birthplace of their nation, as sacred to them as Jerusalem to the Jews. The memory of centuries of Moslem oppression can never be expunged, and land stained by Serbian blood, sweat and tears will never be relinquished. Quite obviously, the ceiling is about to fall on the heads of the Albanians and they know it. The rational move in such a situation is for people to bury their differences and take arms against the common foe. But that, in the context of rural Albania, is easier said than done. Two years before the film was made, Fazli had wantonly stabbed Isak's son to death for telling him to take his cow out of their vineyard. The State demonstrated its manifest indifference to justice when a Serbian judge sentenced the murderer to a mere six weeks in jail. In those circumstances, it was quite understandable why the bereaved father should turn to a far older, unwritten legal code: the blood-feud or vendetta. Now feud is a subject dear to the heart of anthropologists and medieval historians. In their Finals' papers generations of undergraduates have trounced the notion that feuding is messy, pointless, barbarism. Quite the contrary, they explain. Feuding, whether it be among the biblical Israelites, in Beowulf's England or among the Marsh Arabs of Iraq in happier times when they played host to Wilfrid Thesiger, is a social mechanism perfectly adapted to small, clan-dominated communities. Feud satisfies the innate sense of justice but it also limits and contains violence. Forgiving the Blood brought out so much that the bland text-book sociological account of feud overlooks - the feelings of grief constantly inflamed, of guilt, and the pressure exerted on the avenger by the neighbours' whispers. What is more, we saw how wiping the slate clean can be a devilishly slow business. Fazli and his male relatives cowered behind the high stone wall of their farmstead - or sneaked off to work in Germany - leaving their women to do all the outside work. But the particular excellence of this film was to set the private dilemma of an individual against the larger fate of a nation. We saw Isak and his family (the men, needless to say) debating in the Men's Room of their house as to whether he might not after all commute his feud in the interests of Albanian solidarity against the Serbs. 'Action for Forgiveness' is a movement dreamed up by a group of young Albanian political activists during one of their frequent spells in gaol. Its head is a professor of folklore, Anton Cetta, who came up with a satisfying public ritual which could save face all round. It would have been nice to learn a little more about what historical precedence, if any, there was for Cetta's solution. At mass-meetings - until they were outlawed by the Serbian authorities - some 1200 feuds have been settled as villagers embraced the professor and 'forgave the blood'. But in the case of Isak and Fazli, it seemed there was to be no such renunciation of violence, despite the envoys from the league who joined forces with the hodja, the Moslem priest. Isak's proposal was that the murderer's family should have the grace to move away. But they, in the privacy of their Men's Room, decided that resettling 25 people was going to be hopeless. The property market in Kosovo is, to say the least, depressed. But at least Isak was left gloomily chewing over the knowledge that Fazli's lot were even worse than he thought. 'By refusing to move they've done wrong not only to me but to the nation.' Avenging honour was one of the themes in the best of a clutch of programmes about sleaze - about its purveyors, victims and consumers. Living Off the Game in BBC 2's series, 'East' (BBC 2) examined the growing problem of prostitution among Asian women. Last week's announcement that Birmingham city fathers are considering creating a legalised red-light district only made the topic more relevant. It seems that life for Asian girls who go 'on the game' is more difficult than for white co-workers because of the risk from enraged co-religionists, tempted to avenge the stain on Islam. Quite how severe a form this vengeance takes was not made clear - ostracism one might expect, but violence, too? And of course, hypocrisy huffs and puffs. A prostitute in Bradford talked wrily about custom from 'pious elders' with long beards and Sufi robes. Well, 'twas ever thus, which is rather the sentiment I was left with by The Women Trade (Wednesday, BBC 1). However, if you are looking for one good reason why the UK should keep its own immigration laws, here it is. Every year, thousands of under-age girls and women are flown in from the Third World, via Greece, on so-called 'entertainment' visas. As the film established, a proportion of these poor wretches are ignorant of the true nature of the jobs - to work as strippers and prostitutes in the clubs of Antwerp and Brussels. Depressing fare and so albeit to a far lesser degree was World in Action's expose of David Sullivan, king of sleaze (ITV, Sunday). The huff of hypocrisy was audible throughout this boring account of the publisher of Sunday Sport and other tawdry gems of popular literature. I am reasonably sure I would not enjoy having Sullivan to dinner. But the mere fact that he is a nasty, vulgar fellow surely does not merit this kind of pathetic, plodding, 'shock-horror' expose. Nasty and vulgar is also, by definition in my view, anyone who buys his sleazy publications which a surprising number of my social contacts do. What a relief to turn from the bloated features of porn-merchants to the refined AN Wilson, interrogating New Testament scholars as to whether Christ was the Messiah and did really ascend into heaven (C4, Tuesday). This was good stuff, even if Wilson did make a howler in suggesting that Jesus would have used his smattering of Greek to buy tomatoes. Whoops . . .</p>

			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CENSORSHIP ISSUE CONCERNS US ALL  </P> <P> The controversy in Pasadena over a move by Marshall Fundamental School  Principal Joseph Caldera to impose censorship on the school newspaper should  concern journalists and educators as well as parents.  </P> <P> As a journalist who grew up in Pasadena and attended its schools, including  Marshall 25 years ago, I commend the integrity and courage shown by faculty  adviser Mary Ellen MacArthur, student editor Matt Luecke and The Eagle's Eye  staff.  </P> <P> This country is constantly uneasy with, yet drawn toward the tenets of its  foundation: free thought and speech and human equality. The perpetual tension  over the First Amendment between those who would restrict it and those who  would protect it reflects a society's struggle to live up to democratic values.  </P> <P> Board of Education President James McBath's suggestion of a forum appears to be  a thoughtful approach that could lead to a valuable experience. Antonia Darder,  a parent and community leader respected for her insight and ability to  facilitate communication, should be among those asked to lead such a forum.  </P> <P> Student Michael Comas' fantasy piece using culturally stereotypical words that  "perpetuated negative images of people of color," as Darder put it (Times,  March 5), no doubt offended some. Another article explored the relevance of  reciting the Pledge of Allegiance. Such topics have been known to upset people.  </P> <P> Caldera may have thought he was accomplishing damage control when he moved to  restrict the publication process. What he did instead was to run a more subtle,  though far greater risk, of undermining the students' understanding of the  First Amendment's role in a democratic society, where ideas are, literally, the  tools of justice.  </P> <P> Democracy never has been, and never could be furthered by censorship, which,  however well-intentioned, is anathema to it.  </P> <P> U.S. Federal Judge Learned Hand, writing in a case involving the Associated  Press, made an observation that might prove useful to chew on regarding this  situation:  </P> <P> "The First Amendment presupposes that right conclusions are more likely to be  gathered out of a multitude of tongues, than through any kind of authoritative  selection. To many this is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon  it our all."  </P> <P> ARTHUR B. WOOD  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

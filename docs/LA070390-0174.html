			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> EMPEROR AKIHITO REFUSES GIFTS  </P> <P> Emperor Akihito wants Japanese to contribute to charity or the environment  rather than sending him coronation gifts, and no gifts will be accepted from  non-Japanese, officials said today.  </P> <P> Only certain Japanese can send gifts, and the type of item also is limited,  they added.  </P> <P> Akihito, 56, who became emperor in January, 1989, upon the death of his father,  Emperor Hirohito, is to be formally enthroned Nov. 12. The ceremony had to  await the end of a yearlong formal mourning period.  </P> <P> An official of the Imperial Household Agency, which oversees palace affairs,  said many people had been reported hoping to send coronation gifts.  </P> <P> He noted, however, that Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto declared after  a regular Cabinet meeting today that the emperor "appreciates the desire of  people to offer presents, but he strongly wishes contributions to the promotion  of public welfare and maintenance of a green environment instead."  </P> <P> The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said gifts will be accepted  only from the Cabinet, the two houses of Parliament, local governments and  groups of Japanese living abroad. Gifts will not be accepted from any  foreigners or foreign governments.  </P></p>

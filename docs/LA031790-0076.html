			<p><P> March 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOWER AIDS PREDICTION FUELS DEBATE  </P> <P> The suggestion by two researchers that the AIDS epidemic has "crested" and will  result in little more than 200,000 U.S. cases has reanimated the debate over  the future course of one of the country's most pressing public health problems.  </P> <P> The two former government epidemiologists have resurrected a 150-year-old  epidemiological theory that states that epidemics follow the pattern of a  bell-shaped curve. By that theory, called Farr's law, they say the AIDS  epidemic has been on the wane since late 1988.  </P> <P> But a host of other scientists say the theory may create false hope and ignores  the peculiar complexity of the AIDS epidemic. With 1 million Americans believed  infected with the AIDS virus, critics say the estimate of 200,000 cases will  fall seriously short.  </P> <P> The debate, aired Friday in the Journal of the American Medical Assn., involves  sometimes inscrutable epidemiologic arcana. But the outcome could be  significant in the power of projections to influence funding for AIDS research,  treatment and education.  </P> <P> "The risk, of course, is that those who don't understand the nature of AIDS and  HIV, or those who for a long time have been wishing it will just go away . . .  may prematurely declare victory," said Dr. James W. Curran of the U.S. Centers  for Disease Control.  </P> <P> "And that's, of course, not called for," said Curran, the author of an  editorial challenging the applicability of Farr's law to AIDS. "But  unfortunately, AIDS will get the best of these theories. We won't have to wait  long to find out they're wrong."  </P> <P> The Farr's law theory is being aired by Dennis J. Bregman, a former CDC  official who is now an assistant professor of preventive medicine at USC, and  Dr. Alexander Langmuir, who retired in the 1970s as chief of epidemiology for  the CDC.  </P> <P> Bregman and Langmuir base their projection on an 1840 law developed by  pioneering epidemiologist William Farr. Farr fashioned the law after a smallpox  epidemic in England and Wales, and refined it 25 years later after a severe  outbreak of cattle plague.  </P> <P> Using reported cases of AIDS in the United States through 1987, and applying  Farr's principles, Bregman and Langmuir conclude by extrapolation that the AIDS  epidemic peaked in late 1988 and the number of new cases being reported will  bottom out in the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> "If our projection is right, we're saying the epidemic might be only 25% of the  size of what's been projected," Bregman said. "No one is even willing to  consider the possibility that this epidemic is cresting and starting to  decline."  </P> <P> Indeed, Bregman and Langmuir's approach is being challenged by other  epidemiologists and biostatisticians with their own prognostications -- based,  for the most part, on more complex techniques that have been developed only in  recent years.  </P> <P> In an editorial accompanying Bregman and Langmuir's article, Curran and two  other CDC officials contend that Farr's law applies only to simpler epidemics  -- outbreaks in which the new infection is spread at a constant rate and among  a well-defined group of people at risk.  </P> <P> The AIDS epidemic, by contrast, involves several different populations,  different routes of transmission, geographical variations and a long and  variable time in which the infection remains latent in the body before  producing symptoms.  </P> <P> A separate research paper published in the same issue of the journal attempts  to project the course of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco. It takes into  account such things as rates of infection and incubation, and the estimated  number of people at risk.  </P> <P> The model projects that there will have been 12,349 to 17,022 AIDS cases in San  Francisco by June, 1993. The study makes no national projection, but one of its  authors said he and others have estimated 350,000 to 400,000 cases throughout  the country by the end of 1993.  </P></p>

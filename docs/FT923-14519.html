			<p>920707 FT  07 JUL 92 / Arts: Alfred Sisley, an Englishman abroad Of the great impressionists, Alfred Sisley was the one Englishman. He was born in Paris in 1839 of English parents and, for all that he had recently applied for French citizenship, still English at the time of his death early in 1899, at the age of 59. But the question of nationality is less important than that of the work in its context - as with Whistler and Sargent, his near-contemporaries. In this respect Sisley was French enough, intimate colleague and member of a profoundly French school. But yet, perhaps by virtue of his equivocal expatriate status, and the habitual deference retrospectively imposed upon his reputation, we consider him still 'the forgotten', 'the minor', patronisingly 'the one true impressionist'. It is as though to find oneself, and then to remain true to that vision, is in some sense an admission of inadequacy, even a betrayal, so strong have the orthodoxies of modernism, with their assumed necessities of innovation and experiment as opposed to quiet development, become. Small as it is, for so significant an exercise, this retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy is - astonishingly - the first substantial critical study of his life's work attempted by any large institution. And even now, with the opportunity of direct comparison offered at the National Gallery by the exhibition around Manet's Execution of Maximilian paintings, the carping continues. Sisley lacks, it would appear, Manet's historical scope, his political commitment, his radical engagement. Well, so he does. And he also lacks, while we are about it, Pissarro's openly socialist and narrower technical preoccupations, the broad sweep of Monet's ambition and his radical technical innovation, the humanity and technical graphic finesse of Degas and Lautrec, the simple hedonism of Renoir. To which one can only answer: that Sisley was Sisley, with his own peculiar gift and quality. His contemporaries, it would seem, had rather less difficulty with him in their own minds. Asked by Matisse what an impressionist was, Pissarro replied that he was 'a painter who never paints the same picture, who always paints a new picture'. And the typical impressionist? 'Sisley'. As Sisley lay dying, Monet could write of him: 'He is a truly great artist and I believe he is as great a master as any who has ever lived. I looked at some of his works again, which have a rare breadth of vision and beauty. . . ' One does not knowingly speak ill of the dying, but even so. What is that peculiar quality, that gift, that vision? The show is hardly exhaustive in the evidence it offers and, in the early period especially, the picture comes rather 'warts and all', Sisley's youthful awkwardness all too apparent. He was a slow developer, looking to the Barbizon painters and to Courbet for his early examples, and not really coming to that clarity of palette and lightness of touch by which we know him until he was past 30. His work of the 1860s is not crude exactly, but dour, earnest, a shade pedestrian. The change comes quite suddenly around 1870, a time of great change and disruption in France at large, with the Franco-Prussian War, the Commune and the fall of Napoleon III. For Sisley it was marked by the loss of his studio at Bougival, on the Seine below Paris, looted and destroyed by the Prussians, and yet by rather more permanent a commitment to that district on the great loop of the river. He moved to Louveciennes nearby, and in the early 1870s began the successive series of landscape subjects, of town, river and countryside, at Louveciennes, Marly, Port-Marly and Argenteuil, by which his true character as a painter is established. As typical as any is the sequence painted on a visit to England in 1874, along the Thames at Molesey and Hampton Court. The palette has cleared and the handling become looser and more confident, the paint as thick as before but less slabbed and clotted, more mobile on the surface, and the marks of the brush more active and particular, often quite calligraphic in their articulation. As Sisley grows older, so it seems he develops his own peculiar notation, a set of conventional signs, a stroke and flick of the wrist by which, with the utmost rapidity, a figure, a branch, a reflection in the water or the cast of a shadow may be signified. The paintings of a lane at Louveciennes under snow (1874) and of the floods at Port-Marly (1876), with their punts and pollarded trees and heavy, grey spring skies, are particular miracles of this suggestive economy. And from such an example, neither the cheerful directness of the fauves, nor the quieter refinement of Vuillard or Bonnard, are at all remote. The great strength of this exhibition is that what it lacks in scope and numbers is more than made up for by the several series it offers, of Louveciennes, Marly and Hampton Court, and, in the 1880s and 1890s, at Saint-Mammes and Moret, Sisley's last home, on the Seine above Paris. They make together a nicely ironical comment on Pissarro's remark, of never painting the same picture, for indeed they confirm its essential truth. The sequence of paintings along the river at Saint-Mammes (1885), following the village strung out along the opposite bank, caught in the early summer sunshine, is at once consistent in scale and practice, yet infinitely varied, catching in each a particular and achingly poignant nuance of time and circumstance, of light, season, weather. 'A Cezanne', said Matisse, 'is a moment of the artist while a Sisley is a moment of nature', and Matisse was quite right. Alfred Sisley: The Royal Academy, Piccadilly London W1 until October 18. Then at the Musee d'Orsay, Paris, and The Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore. Sponsored by the Fondation Elf with Elf UK. Catalogue (Pounds 35) published in association with the Yale University Press</p>

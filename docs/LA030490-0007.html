			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's upholding of laws only comes into play if he perceives that those  issues are politically expedient. He perceives pro-death penalty and  pro-abortion positions as winning votes, so he subordinates his "deep  convictions" and backs these measures.  </P> <P> On gun control he perceives that an anti-gun position will help, so he actively  tries to make laws backing that view. I did notice, however, that he gave up  pursuing appeals regarding Medi-Cal funding of abortions at about the time he  decided to run for governor. How convenient.  </P> <P> Instead of running for governor, Van de Kamp should resign! No matter how you  disguise him, how you try to sweep his record under the rug, Van de Kamp still  quacks.  </P> <P> MICHAEL V. STRATTON  </P> <P> Brea  </P></p>

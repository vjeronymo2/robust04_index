			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> EMBRYO TRANSFERS BUILD A SUPER HERD  </P> <P> The central Kentucky farm of Bobby and Judy Lutz is truly a family business.  The Lutzes' three children help to care for and milk the Holstein herd, which  is a family in its own right.  </P> <P> About three of every four cows they milk is a daughter or granddaughter of  Mitzi or Alice, two registered Holsteins the Lutzes bought more than 10 years  ago.  </P> <P> In just one decade the Lutzes have built a superior herd of about 200 purebred  Holsteins, something that once took a farmer's lifetime. Embryo transfers --  implanting fertilized eggs from Mitzi or Alice into surrogates -- has made it  possible.  </P> <P> Bobby Lutz says a cow normally will have about four offspring in a lifetime.  Mitzi and Alice each have produced several dozen. He says all of their female  offspring, born to surrogate mothers, have become super milk cows.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investment Paid Off  </P> <P> Embryo transfer, commonly called ET, began in the mid-1970s. Lutz says he and  his wife invested $30,000 in start-up costs in 1980, when ETs were financially  risky and the couple was struggling to pay off their 230-acre farm.  </P> <P> The investment paid off.  </P> <P> The Lutzes last year earned more than $50,000 -- about 25% of their farm income  -- from the sale of frozen embryos and live bulls from embryo transfers.  </P> <P> The family sells embryos for $800 to $1,500 per egg, depending upon pedigree.  </P> <P> "Foreigners prefer the embryos because the risk of importing a disease is less  and it's less expensive than sending a bull or a breeding female," Lutz says.  </P> <P> Pregnancy rates of the surrogates range from about 65% to 80%, about the same  or better than natural breeding, according to farmers and veterinarians.  </P> <P> The process used to be more costly because implants were done surgically. Now  they're generally done with a plunger-type device, and unregistered commercial  animals are usually the surrogates. This allows the farmer to continue using  the superior cow as an egg producer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Some Eggs Frozen  </P> <P> Some eggs are frozen in liquid nitrogen so they can be used or sold later.  </P> <P> Fees for embryo transplants vary, but the costs generally are about what the  Lutzes pay Cheryl and Larry Nelson, owners of Nelson Reproductive Services.  </P> <P> The Nelsons charge $200 to flush embryos from an egg-producing cow with a  saline solution, about one week after the eggs are fertilized through  artificial insemination. It costs the Lutzes $100 per cow for implants and $50  for each egg that is frozen for export.  </P> <P> Injections of hormones beforehand, to prompt an abundance of eggs, aren't  harmful to the cows and don't present a health risk to people who drink their  milk, according to George Hershey, a University of Kentucky dairy specialist.  </P> <P> The protein hormones aren't like steroids and seem to break down in cows'  bodies, he says.  </P> <P> Lutz says the biggest drawback to ET is the record keeping. He says it takes  hours of detailed paper work to track the bloodlines of his herd and embryos.  </P> <P> Embryo transfers may not be for every farmer.  </P> <P> Panayiotis Zavos, University of Kentucky reproductive physiologist, says  farmers who don't own a registered herd may not find the process  cost-effective. He says those who are interested in the technology should  consult an expert with a successful track record.  </P> <P> "Don't let just anyone in to monkey with your cows," Zavos says.  </P></p>

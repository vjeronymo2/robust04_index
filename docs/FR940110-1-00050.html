The Advisory Council shall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review the proposed plan and submit its recommendations to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's board of directors at least seven calendar days before the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank's board of directors is scheduled to vote on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plan. The Bank's board of directors shall vote on the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP implementation plan, and shall submit its approved plan to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board for action. The Board shall approve or disapprove the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed plan within 60 calendar days of receipt. The Bank's plan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not effective until it is approved by the Board, and it must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> become effective at least 45 calendar days before the due date for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP applications established by the Bank. Each Bank must submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its AHP implementation plan to the Board for approval no later  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 180 calendar days after the publication of this rule as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final rule in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.2(d) of the proposed rule provides that the Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved AHP implementation plan shall be made available by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Bank to the public upon request.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.2(e) of the proposed rule provides that the Board  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will approve or disapprove proposed amendments to a Bank's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved AHP implementation plan submitted by the Bank within 60  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar days of receipt.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Authorized and Required Uses of AHP Subsidized Advances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct Subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.3 of the proposed rule states the general  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized uses of AHP subsidized advances and direct subsidies by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants, &sect;960.4 provides specific examples of such authorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unauthorized uses and other use requirements, and &sect;960.5 sets  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth the long-term income-eligibility, affordability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> income-targeting requirements for such uses. These proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections are discussed further below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Authorized Uses of Subsidized Advances or Direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.3 of the proposed rule, consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.3(b) (1) and (2) of the Board's existing AHP regulation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that applicants may use subsidized advances or direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidies received from a Bank under the AHP to either:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> owner-occupied housing units by or for low- or moderate-income  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Finance the purchase, construction or rehabilitation of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rental housing units, at least 20 percent of the units of which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be occupied by and affordable for very low-income households.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> See 12 CFR 960.3(b) (1) and (2).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Specific Use Requirements for Subsidized Advances or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Direct Subsidies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 960.3(c) of the Board's existing AHP regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that ``Program funds may only be used for direct costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to produce and/or finance affordable housing units.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.3(c). A number of questions have arisen as to whether  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific types of costs associated with the financing or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production of housing may be considered ``direct costs'' for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purposes of the Board's regulation. Because of the confusion in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this area, the Board believes that it would be helpful to set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in the rule examples of specific types of costs it considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be authorized and unauthorized for AHP purposes. Accordingly,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;960.4(a) (1) and (2) of the proposed rule sets forth examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific costs related to the purchase, construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation of housing that are authorized and unauthorized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uses of AHP subsidized advances or direct subsidies. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because it is impossible to anticipate all types of costs that may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> arise in the course of financing or producing housing, the list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized and unauthorized costs in proposed &sect;960.4(a) is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exclusive. Other costs not included arguably may or may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify as costs of financing the purchase, construction or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rehabilitation of housing. If an applicant seeks to use funds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under the AHP to pay for costs not specifically included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule, it should consult with the Bank before submitting its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for approval. The Board specifically asks for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments as to whether these authorized and unauthorized costs are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

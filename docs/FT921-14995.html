			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / Syndicated Loans: Lasmo plans to raise Pounds 200m in three-year revolving credit deal LASMO, the UK oil exploration group, last week joined the long list of oil and gas sector companies seeking financing in the syndicated loans market. Barclays won the mandate for Lasmo's Pounds 200m three-year revolving credit and Lasmo's close relationship banks have been approached to syndicate the deal, which is paying a margin of 60 basis points over the London interbank offered rate (Libor). There is a commitment fee of 30 basis points, and the front-end fees are 12.5 basis points for lead managers with Pounds 25m or more, and 9 basis points for managers with Pounds 15m and above. Lasmo successfully bid Pounds 1.1bn for the oil and gas group Ultramar recently, and the acquisition will transform it into one of the biggest oil exploration groups in the world. Bankers associated with the Pounds 200m revolving credit said the funds were 'for general corporate purposes' and not specifically related to the takeover. Meanwhile, Mobil Exploration Norway's Dollars 300m loan was launched in syndication last week. Citicorp and NatWest are joint arrangers for the three-year revolving credit facility. The margin is 40 basis points over Libor and the commitment fee is 20 basis points. The front-end fees are 15 basis points for Dollars 30m and 10 basis points for Dollars 20m. Bankers point out that a number of oil and energy groups were considering launching syndicated loans when oil prices were more buoyant than at present. Oil prices are usually fairly buoyant in the winter, but have dropped Dollars 5 since October to under Dollars 18 a barrel. Bankers are expecting Elf to launch a syndicated loan at some stage over the next few weeks. The loan is for 'at least Pounds 350m', according to one banker, and is expected to finance a North Sea project. In addition, the Pounds 676m deal for Thames Power's financing of the Barking power station is due to be launched in the syndicated loans market soon. The three lead managers are NatWest, Swiss Bank Corporation, and Bank of Montreal, and the margin is understood to be between 115 and 120 basis points over Libor. The 18-year financing is for the construction of a gas-fired power station. Construction is due to start in July 1992, and commercial operations in 1995. Among those energy deals already in syndication are Neste, the Finnish state-owned oil and chemicals group, which recently announced a Dollars 400m 10-year project finance facility, and Aran Energy, which launched a Dollars 225m facility. Birmingham Midshires Building Society last week announced a Pounds 100m medium-term revolving credit facility. The deal is being jointly arranged by JP Morgan and Union Bank of Switzerland and is intended to replace those medium-term standby facilities which fall due this year. The four-year facility is paying a margin of 35 basis points over Libor and a commitment fee of 17.5 basis points.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                       EUROMARKET TURNOVER (DOLLARS M)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                             Primary Market          Secondary Market                        US Dollars  Non-Dollars  US Dollars  Non-Dollars Fixed income bonds   Euros straight           39.9    2,598.6       13,341.8      26,703.1   Other straight            0.0      451.5          515.6      50,717.0   Convertible               0.0        0.0          388.5         371.3 Money market instr   FRN                      40.0        0.0        4,916.2       1,352.1   CD's                     77.2       61.1          766.7         289.8 Short Dollars MT Notes 12,717.8    4,877.3        7,595.4       5,877.0 Warrants                    0.0        0.0          398.8         126.4 Equities                   77.9        0.0          152.2         970.4 Total                  12,952.8    7,988.5       28,075.2      86,407.1  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                  Cedel      Euroclear      Total US Dollars                    17,861.9       23,166.1   41,028.0 Other                         28,471.8       65,923.8   94,395.6  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Week to January 9, 1992 The Warrants and Equities figures are from Euroclear only                                         Source ISMA  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comibol tries to regain access to mines COMIBOL, Bolivia's state mining corporation, has sacked 19 miners and started legal action against three union officials in an attempt to regain access to mines closed by industrial action. The long-running conflict between the government and miners over the introduction of joint venture and leasing contracts is now threatening to develop into open warfare. Victor Baldivieso, a union leader, said the sackings would lead to 'confrontations, sacrifice, and the putting at risk of lives to defend the country's mines'. Mr Baldivieso has warned that his members may occupy the mines of state mining corporation Comibol in protest at the government's actions. The 19 miners sacked by Comibol are blocking the three entrances to the Rasna mine, which was recently subject to a joint venture deal with Cominesa, a subsidiary of Hexagon Resources of the US. The mining ministry is now planning similar action in two further mining works - Colquiri and Catavi - recently handed over to private firms but currently closed by industrial action. The attempts of both Comibol and the mining ministry to force through joint venture and leasing deals in spite of union opposition is a sign of growing desperation. In addition, it is unlikely that the World Bank, at present withholding a Dollars 35m mining credit in protest at the slow pace of change at Comibol, will release the funds until the three occupied mining operations are back in production.</p>

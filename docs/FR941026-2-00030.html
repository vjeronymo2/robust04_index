			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Characteristics and Functions of the Site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The wetlands within the proposed alignment of the NHCH as well as the 100+ square mile study area, as defined in the EIS, provide high quality, diverse habitat for fish and wildlife, a travel corridor for upland and wetland wildlife, food web production for on-site and downstream biological communities, nutrient and pollutant uptake and assimilation, floodwater storage, and flow moderation. Additionally, they serve as an environment for fishing, hunting, bird watching and other recreational activities. The EIS states that the vast majority of the wetlands provide a wide spectrum of functions and values. Wildlife habitat rated the highest at most of the sites.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the wetlands in the study area are riparian systems which border streams that flow to the Merrimack River, including Limit, Second, Merrill, Glover, Chase, and Pennichuck Brooks. Wetlands bordering streams provide special values. The streams transport organic material from upstream areas in the watershed to the floodplain wetlands, supporting food web production for on-site and downstream biological communities. Riverine wetlands also assimilate nutrients and pollutants, store floodwater, and moderate flows. These riparian corridors are also valuable because of their high productivity and travel use by wildlife.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The study area contains valuable wildlife habitat, and includes over 200 different species of birds, mammals, amphibians and reptiles. The New Hampshire Heritage Program considers over 20% of these species uncommon, rare, threatened, or endangered in the state. Over 75% of the species in the study area utilize or depend on wetlands or riparian systems for survival.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the more than 100 bird species that utilize the study area include great blue heron and green-backed heron. Several wetland birds are uncommon or threatened, including species such as American bittern and eastern screech owl. Many of these aquatic species need large tracts of land to survive, such as northern waterthrush and belted kingfisher; others, such as red-shouldered hawk, depend greatly on riparian wetland systems. The bald eagle, a federal endangered species, uses this portion of the Merrimack River during winter for feeding, roosting and as a travel corridor. A peregrine falcon, also a federal endangered species, was observed at the Second Brook wetland complex during its migratory patterns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> More than 40 mammal species live in the study area, including otter and mink. These aquatic species also require large blocks of habitat in which to forage and breed. Some of the mammal species in the study area are considered uncommon or rare in the state, such as fisher, hoary bat, and southern bog lemming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Over 30 species of reptiles and amphibians also inhabit the project site such as the uncommon blue spotted salamander; the vast majority of these species need wetlands for various life functions. Several species of amphibians in New Hampshire are obligate vernal pool species; that is, they require vernal pools to breed and survive. Moreover, some of these species, which can live 20 to 25 years, return to their natal pools each year to breed. Therefore, destruction of these pools may eliminate entire breeding populations of these animals. For example, one obligate species, spotted salamander, was observed at numerous vernal pools directly on the proposed alignment. Another obligate species, blue spotted salamander, a state listed species, was also observed at several locations on the proposed alignment. Painted turtles and other species were also observed using these valuable aquatic systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Fish use wetlands as nursery areas and most important recreational fishes spawn in wetlands. Second Brook and Glover Brook are stocked with trout; the Merrimack River itself likely supports more than 30 fish species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Area-sensitive species such as mink and otter as well as forest interior birds, such as red-shouldered hawk, broad-winged hawk, northern waterthrush, Canada warbler, barred owl, and black and white warbler live in the study area. These wetland species typically require large tracts for breeding and decline sharply with habitat fragmentation and reductions in forest patch sizes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

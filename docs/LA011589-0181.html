			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REDELL BIDS FAREWELL TO FOOTBALL AS PROFESSION  </P> <P> Bill Redell, who resigned as Crespi High's football coach in December, said  this week that he will not pursue another coaching position next fall and has  retired from the profession. Redell, who works as an insurance salesman, had  contacted Athletic Director Stan Morrison of UC Santa Barbara about a position  with the Gauchos, but nothing has developed.  </P> <P> "I made a couple other inquiries but nothing materialized so I guess it's time  to get out," Redell said. "I'm not willing to run all over the country. If I  was 30 it would be one thing, but I'm 47.  </P> <P> "I'm going to miss it because it was so much fun. At least I can say the last  game I coached was in the Rose Bowl."  </P> <P> Redell has been selected as a co-coach for the South team in this summer's  Shrine All-Star Game at the Rose Bowl. He also will be co-coach in a summer  Valley-area all-star game sponsored by the Daily News.  </P> <P> Redell coached for 2 years in the now-defunct United States Football League and  was an all-pro quarterback in the Canadian Football League. He compiled a  43-16-1 record in 5 years in 2 stints at Crespi and coached the school to its  only Southern Section football title when the Celts won the Big Five Conference  title in 1986.

			<p><P> November 8, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: LUCIANI TO OPERATE GRIFFIN'S CASINO  </P> <P> Former Golden Nugget Inc. executive Alfred Luciani has been appointed to run  Merv Griffin's financially troubled Resorts International Casino Hotel.  </P> <P> The announcement came at the same time disgruntled bondholders were deciding  whether to file a lawsuit forcing New Jersey's first gaming company into  involuntary bankruptcy.  </P> <P> Griffin has asked Resorts bondholders to approve a massive restructuring in  which the company's two classes of bondholders would receive significantly less  interest and principal in return for cash and stock. However, unsecured  bondholders are unhappy with the deal and have been rumored poised to file suit  by the end of the week.  </P> <P> Resorts President David Hanlon named Luciani executive vice president and chief  operating officer of the 680-room Resorts International Casino Hotel.  </P> <P> "Al represents a strong addition to our management team," Hanlon said in a  prepared statement.  </P> <P> Luciani held a number of executive positions in the Golden Nugget over an  eight-year period, including president and chief executive of Golden Nugget Las  Vegas, where he was responsible for the operation of the 2,000-room casino  hotel, and executive vice president of Golden Nugget Atlantic City.  </P> <P> Golden Nugget no longer has a casino hotel in Atlantic City. It is now called  Bally's Grand.  </P> <P> Most recently, Luciani headed A.L.M. Moonstone Inc., a New Jersey company  formed to buy the Claridge Hotel Casino. However, after months of elaborate  negotiations failed to culminate in a deal, Claridge officials in September  pulled out of the transaction.  </P></p>

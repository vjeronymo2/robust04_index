As an effort to revitalize the PAKEM [Oversight of  Faiths Among the People] Team, Attorney General Singgih, S.H.  [Master of Laws], installed the Central PAKEM Coordination Team  at the Attorney General's Office Building in Jakarta.    From the time it was formed in 1949 until 1993, the PAKEM  banned 523 faiths. The team's job is to receive and analyze  reports and/or information about faiths among the people. The  PAKEM Team also has the job of carefully researching and  evaluating developments in particular faiths to ascertain their  impact on public order and security.    At the central level, the team is chaired by the attorney  general, with the deputy attorney general for intelligence as  deputy chairman. Other members of the PAKEM Team include the  director general of sociopolitical affairs of the Department of  Home Affairs, the director general of culture at the Department  of Education and Culture, the assistant for territorial affairs  to the ABRI [Indonesian Armed Forces] chief of General Staff,  the second deputy to the chief of the State Intelligence  Coordinating Agency, and the director of intelligence and  security for the Indonesian Police.    As he installed the Central PAKEM Coordination Team,  Attorney  General Singgih said that the heterogeneity of the Indonesian  people with respect to ethnic groups, religions, races, classes,  cultures, and languages provides potential for the emergence of  interference with national unity and integrity.    "The Central PAKEM Team has been formed to oversee the  activities of faiths to ensure that they will not plunge into  endeavors that could threaten the order of society and state  under applicable laws," he stated. According to Singgih, the  PAKEM Team will also face challenges and obstacles that must be  resolved collectively with regard to legal materials,  coordination among involved agencies, facilities, and  infrastructure.    Nevertheless, the attorney general said he was confident  that  by looking sharply at the problems being faced and by carefully  formulating efforts to deal with them--and equipped with the  experience of its members--the team will be able to take  integrated action to handle the various issues involved in  overseeing faiths among the people.    Meanwhile, Soeparman, S.H., chief of public relations for  the  Attorney General's Office, said that the background of the  revitalization of the PAKEM Team is the flow of globalization,  which makes possible the entrance of foreign or existing faiths  that could influence faiths already present in Indonesia.    In principle, the government will ban faiths that deviate  from GBHN [Broad Outline of State Policy] provisions on the  subject, namely that the promotion of faith in One God must not  be oriented to the formation of new religions and that such  promotion must be in accordance with the first and second  principles of Pancasila [ideology of the Indonesian state].    Faiths that deviate and are banned are those that are not  consistent with Indonesia's national political, economic,  social, and cultural conditions, he explained.</p>

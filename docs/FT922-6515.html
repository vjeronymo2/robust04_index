After lower interest charges of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 4.06m) there was a pre-exceptionals profit of Pounds 1m (Pounds 2.35m). However exceptional charges relating to cost-cutting actions, including reducing the workforce by 110, amounted to Pounds 1.58m. The company said that the period saw continuing and increasingly difficult trading conditions with the sale of new vehicles continuing to fall and demand for used vehicles being patchy. During the period borrowings were cut by Pounds 3m. Turnover was lower at Pounds 218.9m (Pounds 245.6m). After a tax credit of Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 645,000 charge) earnings per share were 0.2p (1.68p) basic or 0.05p (1.39p) fully diluted.

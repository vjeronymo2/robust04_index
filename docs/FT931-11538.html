			<p>930202 FT  02 FEB 93 / UK Company News: South West Water launches Pounds 35m bond SOUTH WEST Water yesterday announced a Pounds 35m bond issue, becoming the second water services company in a week to launch a fund raising. Most of the money raised through the private placement will be used to pay for Haul-Waste, the waste management business acquired last month from English China Clays. Of the Pounds 27.5m purchase price, Pounds 25m is due on completion, expected within a week. The bond issue, which is redeemable in 1998 and bears interest at 8.375 per cent, follows last week's Pounds 144.5m rights issue and other fund raising from Wessex Water. Wessex will use Pounds 113m of the money to buy Waste Management Ltd from NFC, the transport and logistics group. South West holds net cash of about Pounds 80m but decided against using the money, most of which is in short term investments, because it is earning reasonably high rates of interest. South West, which has one of the highest capital expenditure plans among water companies, is likely to become a net borrower by the end of its financial year on March 31. Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said Haul-Waste would become South West's main waste subsidiary.</p>

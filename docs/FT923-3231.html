			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (5): Top of the priority list - All hands to developing offshore business DEVELOPMENT of the finance sector has top priority. Mr Ramakrishna Sithanen, the finance minister, is confident that Mauritius can become a regional financial centre. 'We want the financial and services sectors to become the fourth pillar of our economy.' Possibly the most important single policy thrust for the 1990s is the attempt to turn Mauritius into an offshore business centre. The initial drive for offshore banks has broadened to cover all footloose business activities. Seven banks - six of them with onshore operations - have been granted offshore licences. There are three new players: Credit Lyonnais (joint venture with the market leader, the Mauritius Commercial Bank); the State Bank of India with the number two player, the State Commercial Bank, and Banque Privee Edmond de Rothschild (Ocean Indien) Ltd. Officials concede that the response has been disappointing, especially the absence of a Japanese or German bank. While bankers say they hope to attract deposits and lending opportunities from Asia, especially India, they see opportunities too in the broader sphere of fund management, (two international firms have already been launched), insurance, shipping and aircraft management and leasing, and a whole raft of international business services. While Mr Sithanen is confident that Mauritius is well-placed to exploit economic recovery in sub-Saharan Africa, it is difficult to see why African depositors and investors should prefer Mauritius to a European or Far East offshore centre. It is hard to escape the feeling that Mauritius is a touch remote for some of these activities. But the minister points to the financial sector's strong growth in recent years - an average of 12 per cent a year - and to the benefits he expects to flow from the liberalisation and deregulation that figured extensively in his June budget. There is a strong case for greater competition. Two of 13 banks dominate - the Mauritius Commercial Bank with 34 per cent of deposits and 38 per cent of advances, and the government-owned State Commercial Bank, which has a 26 per cent market share of both deposits and lending. Barclays, and Hong Kong and Shanghai, each have a 6 per cent to 7 per cent market share. Banque Nationale de Paris Internationale has 4 per cent. In the budget, bank rate was lowered to 8 per cent from 11 per cent previously; the reduction in interest rates followed the sharp fall in inflation (from 12.8 per cent in 1990-1991 to 2.8 per cent in the year to June 1992. For 1992, inflation is forecast at 5 per cent (compared with 7.1 per cent in 1991). Lending rates were differentiated by sector so that, while EPZ and other priority firms could borrow at a minimum of 13 per cent (now 10.5 per cent), traders had to pay 17.5 per cent. Government officials say now that rates have been deregulated; it is the banks that are responsible for rate discrimination, and not the authorities. Like all directed credit systems, this one ran into problems; banks were reluctant to lend to under-capitalised, highly-geared, poorly managed EPZ firms - especially given the high turnover of firms there. There have been 53 closures in the EPZ in the last year alone - nearly a tenth of the total number. Clearly this was no way to encourage diversification, nor the integration of the 'domestic' and EPZ sectors. But with priority sector ceilings now removed, 60 per cent of bank lending has been deregulated. This has paved the way for more efficient bank lending, though the liquidity overhang in the market - estimated by the minister at MR3bn - will remain a threat to price stability.</p>

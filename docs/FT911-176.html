			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Doctus to sell marketing arm DOCTUS, the management and personnel consultancy, is negotiating the sale of Wallace Group, its marketing subsidiary. Discussions are at an early stage, but if the deal comes off, it could more than wipe out Doctus' Pounds 25m debt, writes Jane Fuller. Wallace came into Doctus in June 1989 through the Pounds 26m merger with Prospective, formerly the Pineapple Group. The all-share deal brought in a considerable amount of debt. Prospective had acquired Wallace, a US-based group, in 1988 and the merger with Doctus had saved it paying up to Pounds 43.75m in shares as a deferred consideration. Mr Brian Blake, chairman of Doctus, said at the time of the Prospective deal that he wanted to build up a diversified business services group. Marketing accounted for 60 per cent of operating profit last year. Last month Doctus issued a profit warning for the six months to March 31 and announced that it had decided to focus on management consultancy and 'human resources', a technical staff agency, career counselling and training - hence the question-mark over the marketing side. A shake-up of management also saw Mr Blake shed the chief executive's role. Doctus' share price has fallen from 138p to 33p since last May. It gained 1p yesterday.</p>

			<p>931029 FT  29 OCT 93 / World Trade News: Swiss group pulls out of India HOFFMANN La Roche, the Swiss drugs group, is pulling out of its Indian subsidiary in a move which will not help the country's campaign to attract foreign investment, writes R C Murthy in Bombay and Stefan Wagstyl in New Delhi. Hoffmann is selling its controlling stake in Roche Products to Mr Ajay Piramal, head of Nicholas Laboratories, a successful local pharmaceuticals maker, because of delays in promised revisions of price controls on drugs. Indian drugs prices are among the lowest in world because of government-imposed limits. They are periodically revised upwards but have generally failed to keep pace with inflation. The impact of Hoffmann's move on India's efforts to attract other foreign companies may be limited, as the problems faced by drugs companies are specific to their industry. Mr Piramal is paying Rs320m (Pounds 6.6m) for a 74 per cent stake in Roche Products, which in the year to last March had sales of Rs711m.</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / WHO to give bigger Aids role to other UN agencies THE World Health Organisation is to examine how the United Nations system can tackle Aids more effectively, a move likely to see other UN agencies taking a bigger role in combating the worldwide epidemic. WHO members are expected to approve today a resolution calling for a study into the benefits of a joint UN programme on Aids. The resolution has been sponsored by 34 rich and poor countries, including the US, Britain and Japan. Dr Michael Merson, head of the WHO's global Aids programme, said yesterday that the goal of the study would be to identify how to use existing financial and human resources most effectively, how to raise new resources and how best to apply 'what we know'. This meant education for safer sex and the treatment of other sexually transmitted diseases which increased the risk of Aids. Dr Merson said about 15 experimental vaccines were undergoing safety trials but he added: 'I don't think we will have a vaccine for prevention of HIV (the virus that causes Aids) or Aids before the end of the decade.' The WHO says some 13m people in the world have been infected with the HIV virus and this could rise to between 30m and 40m by 2000. The resources needed to tackle the pandemic effectively are huge. Dr Merson said the cost of preventive work in developing countries was an estimated Dollars 2.9bn (Pounds 1.9bn) a year. The WHO global Aids programme has an annual budget of about Dollars 85m. The other agencies involved in the study, which will be presented to the WHO's executive board next January, are the UN Development Programme, the UN Children's Fund (Unicef), the UN Population Fund, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco) and the World Bank. WHO officials say they fully back the study, and expect the world health body to take a leading role in any joint UN Aids programme. But the loss or erosion of its flagship programme will be seen by some as a further blow to the organisation's prestige, following the damaging row surrounding last week's re-election of WHO's director-general, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima. The 93 to 58 vote by the World Health Assembly to confirm Dr Nakajima in office for a second five-year term showed a high degree of support for Western criticism of Dr Nakajima's leadership and concern over the findings of an external audit revealing financial irregularities in contracts for executive board members. The two-week assembly ends today.</p>

			<p><P> August 3, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH / WHAT'S NEW: TAKE A VACATION FROM ALL THAT ACTION  </P> <P> THIS WEEK'S MOVIES  </P> <P> Ready for some classy films as a relief from all this summer's hard-action  pictures? Just head for your video store. There you'll find two movies which go  for more emotional responses than the usual quick thrill, nasty scare and cheap  laugh.  </P> <P> "Driving Miss Daisy" (Warner, $92.95, PG) won four 1989 Academy Awards,  including Best Picture and Best Actress (Jessica Tandy). It's a quiet, lovely,  humorous and moving adaptation of a play about the relationship between an  elderly Southern woman and her black chauffeur (Morgan Freeman) over several  years. The plot may be a little predictable -- the biggest surprise about  "Daisy" is that its subtle charms attracted more than $100 million at the box  office -- but don't let that keep the 99-minute tape off your rental list. The  fine supporting cast includes Dan Aykroyd and Patti LuPone.  </P> <P> "Enemies -- A Love Story" (Media, $89.98, R) just came out this week, and not  -- as you may have read elsewhere -- three weeks ago (the release was delayed).  Like "Daisy," this 1989 Paul Mazursky film also mixes comedy and drama in a  sophisticated manner as it tells about a Holocaust survivor (Ron Silver) who  keeps up post-World War II relationships with three women after moving to New  York. "Enemies," also stars Anjelica Huston, Lena Olin, Margaret Sophie Stein  and Alan King. TERRY ATKINSON  </P></p>

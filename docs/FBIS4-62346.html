Two hundred and twenty years ago our  wise ancestors decided that their people will live within  Russia," says an appeal to the North Ossetian people signed  today by North Ossetian President Akhsarbek Galazov and  Parliament Speaker Yuriy Biragov on behalf of the North Ossetian  Government and the Supreme Soviet.    The appeal lays down the basis to implement the Civic Accord  Agreement signed in Moscow on April 28, 1994.    "Today we call on our compatriots to work together to  achieve  comprehensive accord and stop devastating processes in our  multinational society, put Ossetia on the path of peace and  creation, consolidation of unity and might of great Russia,"  says the document.    The president told the signing ceremony that the appeal is  the first step to implement the Civic Accord idea in the  multinational republic.</p>

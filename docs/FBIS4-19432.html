			<p>BFN     [Text] Silvio Berlusconi has once again invited the PPI  [Italian People's Party] to talks. Berlusconi said: I would be  happy if a political force we have always looked to, and with a  program very close to our own, accepted to sit down at a table  with us to find out what we could do together in parliament.  Berlusconi added: I do not even rule out a possible government  pact.    Rocco Buttiglione lost no time in replying. He said that he  appreciated Berlusconi's opening out toward them, but added: I  cannot understand why the invitation to talks should concern  only the matter of the Senate speaker and not the speaker of the  Chamber of Deputies as well.    [National Alliance leader] Gianfranco Fini has said no to  any  talks. The National Alliance leader commented: I cannot  imagine a government involving the PPI and Forza Italia.</p>

			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / GM to pay back pick-up owners A federal judge in Philadelphia has approved a legal settlement involving 6m pick-up trucks made by General Motors between 1973 and 1987, AP-DJ reports from Detroit. The settlement requires GM to give Dollars 1,000 coupons to owners of GM pick-ups with side-mounted fuel tanks. The coupons can only be used to buy GM trucks, most of which have profit margins greater than Dollars 1,000. Analysts say the settlement will increase GM's profits. Safety critics intend to appeal against the settlement, which covers 49 states. In Texas, a separate settlement was reached. The settlements in Texas and in Philadelphia end more than 20 separate suits seeking compensation for owners of GM pick-ups with side-mounted tanks. The federal government says the pick-ups are more likely than comparable vehicles to erupt in flames when hit from the side.</p>

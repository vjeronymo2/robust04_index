			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Huntingdon shares fall 22% on profits warning SHARES IN Huntingdon International Holdings, the life sciences and engineering services group, fell by nearly 22 per cent yesterday after a profits warning and the announcement of a rationalisation of its US-based engineering and environment services group. The shares closed 45p down at 163p. Huntingdon said that trading conditions for the US companies were now even worse than when it announced its first quarter profits of Pounds 3.73m last month. It further reduced its profit expectations for the second quarter. At the time of the figures announcement it blamed continuing weakness in the US economy and abnormal weather. Huntingdon is closing 10 of the engineering and environmental services' 80 US offices 'as a result of a strategic review of the company's US businesses, and in the light of the continuing decline in some areas of the US construction and environmental markets.' The construction sector has historically contributed more than 50 per cent of the company's US revenues. The costs, estimated at Pounds 3m or 2.5p per share, will be taken as an exceptional charge in the present quarter, and is expected to result in an after-tax loss. In last year's second quarter pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.37m. An improvement in US trading was not expected until a general revival in the economy reached the construction industry. However the management said that the performance for the the rest of the year to September 30 should be ahead of last year, helped by the continuing strong performance of the life sciences group and the Travers Morgan consulting engineers.</p>

			<p><P> July 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN, 92, IS STRICKEN AS SHE TESTIFIES IN SUIT  </P> <P> A 92-year-old woman was reported in critical condition Wednesday evening after  suffering a cerebral hemorrhage while testifying in a civil trial here.  </P> <P> A witness said that Lila Coke had been on the stand in Superior Court for about  20 minutes when she developed difficulty breathing and became dizzy.  </P> <P> Suddenly, she seemed to freeze, and her lawyer helped her down from the witness  stand and laid her on the floor.  </P> <P> Jurors were quickly ushered into a back room and paramedics took Coke to  Western Medical Center-Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Judge Richard J. Beacom declared a mistrial but retained jurisdiction so that  new jurors can be picked and the trial can begin again quickly when Coke  recovers.  </P> <P> In a lawsuit, Coke seeks damages for injuries she suffered several years ago  when she tripped on a garden hose at Leisure World in Seal Beach, where she  lives.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Notis Papadhopoulos: "Andreas' Maneuver and </F> Dialogue with Skopje"]    [Excerpts] In recent days, [Prime Minister] Andreas  Papandreou has repeatedly used the expression "irony of history"  when addressing the Skopje issue. This phrase faithfully  reflects reality. [Former Prime Minister] Konstandinos  Mitsotakis, who wanted to settle the Skopje issue any old way,  failed to achieve his goal because of Andonis Samaras' internal  resistance in the New Democracy (ND), the Panhellenic Socialist  Movement's (PASOK) "hardline" stance, and public opposition. The  PASOK government, which inherited an issue rife with "faits  accomplis" is thus compelled to follow a defensive policy on  this issue, since Greece lost the possibility of a veto it held  in the European Union (EU) following Skopje's entrance into the  UN.    However, why did the PASOK government postpone the procedure  of UN intervention, which the ND had agreed to?    From the very beginning, the PASOK government was opposed to  the name of "Macedonia" for Skopje. This position was developed  by Mr. Papandreou both during political leaders' meetings and in  his pre-electoral campaign. While the UN procedure that the ND  had accepted reinforced the three conditions demanded at this  time by Mr. Papandreou from Mr. Gligorov, it resulted in the  name of "Nova Makedonia." The former government had proposed to  the UN secretary general the name of "Slavomakedonia," which  Skopje rejected. Both names used the term "Macedonia," and  therefore were contrary to PASOK's expressed policy. Hence, the  PASOK government expected nothing from that UN procedure.    Which are the three conditions set by the government to come  to the negotiating table with Skopje?    The first is changing the preamble of the Skopjean  Constitution, the second is a clear statement by Skopje  regarding the inviolability of Greek borders, and the third is  the removal of the Veryina star from Skopje symbols. [passage  omitted]    Why did Mr. Papandreou mention at this time that the name  issue is included in the negotiations as well, since, as he  himself stressed, Greece will not recognize a state with the  name of "Macedonia"?    Mr. Papandreou's tactical maneuver was undertaken to bring  Skopje to the negotiating table. And, of course, because the  differences between Greece and Skopje center essentially on the  name. Therefore, no dialogue could take place under a UN aegis  if--at least in theory, the name issue was not one of the  elements of this dialogue (something that, according to  information, the UN transmitted to Athens through the United  States). Additionally, Mr. Papandreou wants to make clear that  if the Skopjeans agree to the three conditions, this does not  mean that the differences between them and Athens cease to  exist. Simply, the issue of the name can be settled at a later  time. Yesterday's statement by Deputy Foreign Minister  Theodhoros Pangalos is characteristic: "We can live without the  immediate settlement of the name issue."    Does a dialogue in which Greece negotiates--but does not  discuss the name issue--mean that it is aimed at normalizing  relations between the two countries, with the name issue in  abeyance?    As long as the Skopjeans are not convinced by Greek  arguments  (political and economic) to change their name and the present  impasse on the name persists, then naturally the dialogue with  Skopje has no other objective than to promote a peaceful  coexistence between the two countries.    Could the Greek side exert pressure on Skopje--on a  bilateral  level--so that it will change its name?    Greece could use a number of severe measures against Skopje,  such as not allowing goods to reach this country by closing the  border or the Salonica port. However, this measure would have  negative consequences for Greece now that Skopje is a UN member  and has been recognized by every country in the world. This  would show that Athens is a destabilizing influence in the area  and flouts international legality. Secondly, it would create  enormous legal problems for Greece within the Community, for  Athens has no right to obstruct intra-EC trade. Thirdly, because  Athens-Skopje relations will become very tense, with Skopje  henceforth depending on Bulgaria, Albania, and Turkey, which  would like to play a primary role in the region. If Greece  closes the border, it will throw Skopje into the arms of the  countries nourishing designs on it. On the contrary, if a  hardline stance had been adopted since the beginning of  Yugoslavia's dissolution, perhaps things would be different  today.    So, is Greece condemned to live peacefully with Skopje?    It is. Because stability in the region mandates the  continued  existence of the statelet, given that Skopje's neighbors (with  the exception of Greece), nourish territorial ambitions against  it. However, the dismemberment of the statelet (between Serbia,  Albania, Bulgaria) would both strengthen these countries and not  change the borders in the area, thus opening Pandora's box.</p>

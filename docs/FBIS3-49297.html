			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Atanas Matev: "Own Choice"] </F>   [Text] According to a promise made by Theodhoros Pangalos,  Greece's alternate minister of foreign affairs responsible for  European issues, Greece will not exploit its six-month  presidency of the European Union to further its foreign policy  aims.    This sounds all very fine, but the other EU countries do not  accept his words on faith, but will judge the Greek presidency  by its actions. For one cannot assume from the outset that  Athens will not succumb to the temptation of promoting its own  interests in its relations with Bulgaria, relying on the  authority and opportunities offered by its term of leadership of  the European Union that has just begun.    The EU presidency provides great opportunities to the  country  exercising its functions. One such opportunity -- and a very  important one -- is that the country in question determines the  agendas of the various EU bodies, and can speed up or slow down  the consideration of important problems.    For Bulgaria, this is of great importance. For a number of  reasons, a slowdown occurred in Bulgaria's relations with the  European Union, which it is now necessary to make good. Greece  is able to help or hinder this process.    Athens is perfectly well aware of this. It also knows that  certain profound differences exist in Bulgarian-Greek relations  regarding Balkan problems, such as the Macedonian question.    It is up to Greece to decide whether or not it wants  Bulgaria's relations with the European Union to expand.    It is also up to Bulgaria to decide how to respond to any  particular situation, and its response should be an honorable  one.</p>

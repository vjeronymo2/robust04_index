			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wang Yonghong: "Government Urges Better Protection of </F> Forests"]    [Text] Excess logging in recent years prompted the central  government to urge all departments and local governments to ban  misuse of the nation's forests.    "The annual quota for allowable tree-felling must be  strictly  observed and all activities involving logging, transporting and  processing of wood must be conducted under licences," the  government announced.    China's boom in construction and development has led to a  worrisome imbalance between logging and new growth in the  nation's forests, the statement warned. The supply of mature  timber is almost exhausted, it was noted.    Legal and administrative units of the government may not  engage in such activities, the government said.    Some inspections will be launched later this year to help  implement the Forest Law and relevant regulations, according to  the circular issued by the State Council, the country's highest  governing body.    All violations of the Forest Law and regulations, such as  clear-cutting forests, illegally occupying woodlands and  indiscriminate hunting of wildlife, will be severely punished,  it said.    Violations rose 16 percent last year, compared with 1992,  said an official from the Ministry of Forestry.    Large profits from trading in timber -- in short supply on  the market -- attracted more people and even government  departments to engage in the business, noted the official, who  declined to be identified.    Some culprits, often armed with weapons, had attacked forest  keepers and looted timber from tree farms.    Last year, 31 forest keepers and officials working at timber  checkpoints were killed, and another 1,200 were wounded,  according to the official.    Booming construction and industrial development zones also  consumed large amounts of woodland.    Some local governments, ignoring the Forest Law and relevant  regulations, occupied forest-land for other use without approval  from authorities or sold woodland at very low prices in order to  attract outside investment for industrial development.    As a result, some 450,000 hectares of woodland was lost  annually for various kinds of development programme or  construction, said the official.    In a bid to curb such unchecked tree-felling and to keep a  balance between timber growth and consumption, the central  government has since 1987 required licenses and implemented  quotas for logging.    Despite such measures, the quota was exceeded every year,  the  official noted.    Although China has increased its forest coverage to current  13.9 percent from 12.9 percent of national territory five years  ago, its mature timber is nearly exhausted, with only about 1.96  billion cubic metres left.</p>

			<p>940426 FT  26 APR 94 / International Company News: Siemens earnings flat at half-time A fall of 16 per cent in domestic sales at Siemens for the six months ended March, was offset by strengthening foreign business, the German electrical and electronics multinational reported yesterday. Group net earnings were unchanged at DM879m (Dollars 514m) on turnover up 3 per cent at DM38bn, Siemens said. However, growth in sales was due to the first-time inclusion of the US Sylvania lighting business. Osram's turnover jumped 71 per cent to DM2.9bn. A similar rise in lighting product orders, reflecting recovery in the north American economy and the US automotive industry, contributed to an overall 9 per cent increase in demand. While the foreign order book was up 21 per cent at DM27bn after a 33 per cent advance in the first quarter, domestic demand for the six months showed no relative change, and was 6 per cent lower at DM17.5bn. Incoming orders are considered an important indicator at Siemens, but the figures are subject to sharp short-term fluctuations because of the high capital costs of projects such as power stations.</p>

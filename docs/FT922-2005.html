			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / People: Instructive role for Wally Olins Wally Olins, one of the UK's design gurus, has decided to go back to school. 'Not before time,' might be the cry of all those critics of the revamped corporate image sector of the design world, of which Olins is a leading light. But before the knives flash too fiercely, let it be known that Olins is returning to education not to learn but to instruct. He has just been appointed visiting professor at Lancaster University management school, where he will be involved initially in the school's MBA courses. Later he will participate in the expansion of the school's marketing programme; there are plans to introduce an advertising course this year. Olins will continue his role as chairman of Wolff Olins, the corporate identity consultancy, which he co-founded. Lancaster clearly feels chuffed with the appointment. Its press release proudly mentions Wolff Olins' corporate identity work for VW/Audi, Prudential, Bovis, Akzo and the Metropolitan police force in London. But strangely, it omits to mention the most famous recent Wolff Olins work, the corporate redesign for BT, the implementation of which is estimated to have cost some Pounds 50m. The new logo - a silhouette of Pan blowing a heraldic trumpet - met with widespread derision, not least because Pan blew a syrinx. ***** Lord Kindersley, who has chaired Brent Walker through its Pounds 1.65bn refinancing, is to retire from the group at next month's annual meeting. He was appointed in January 1991 expecting a fairly brief, though arduous, tenure of the job. But the repeated delays in completing the refinancing until the end of March this year kept him occupied seven days a week. Now, at 62, he looks forward to spending some time on his other interests, he says. One of his top priorities is to organise a deer-park owners' initiative to improve the marketing of venison. He has 400 deer of his own in Kent. His preoccupation with Brent Walker, which yesterday reported an annual loss totalling Pounds 411.4m, has, he says, nearly cost him his place on the management committee of Wimbledon. And he feels that as chairman of the Thailand Investment Trust he really ought to visit the country. Also resigning is Alan Clements (right), former ICI finance director, who joined as a non-executive director in the early stages of the refinancing as well. He subsequently became the only non-executive director on the board and had to carry the burden that entailed. He too has other interests requiring his time, not the least his directorship of Mirror Group Newspapers. Brent Walker is in the process of recruiting a new chairman and some non-executive directors. Some names should be ready by the agm.</p>

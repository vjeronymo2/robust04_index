			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / International Company News: Degussa moves ahead 12% to DM200m DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and drugs group, increased pre-tax profits by 12 per cent last year, in spite of losses in its important metals division. Cost-cutting and reduced investments helped improve earnings to DM200m (Dollars 125.7m) after a 44 per cent profits slump in the previous year. Turnover was down 4 per cent at DM12.8bn, mainly because of a 22 per cent fall in precious metals sales. Chemicals suffered from lower prices, but sales rose 1 per cent and profits improved. Meanwhile, turnover from pharmaceuticals, the smallest of the group's core businesses, increased 32 per cent to DM1.75bn. The proposed dividend is unchanged at DM7. The company said there was no sign of an early recovery. Increasingly recessive tendences, detected in the last quarter of the year under review, had continued in the early part of the new financial year, especially inside Germany. After allowing for the effects of acquisitions, Degussa reduced its workforce by 2,000 people.</p>

			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / UK Company News: A big boost for UK cable television THE UK cable television industry has received a significant financial boost  -the first substantial injection of equity from US financial institutions. EM Warburg Pincus and Bankers Trust are investing up to Pounds 70m in the UK cable and telephone operations of the Comcast Corporation, which has around 2.8m cable television subscribers in the US. The new investors will take a controlling stake in Comcast UK, although they will not become involved managerially. Cable television has developed slowly in the UK, mainly because of the difficulty of raising the appropriate long-term finance. Comcast is one of the UK's largest cable operators, with franchises covering more than 1m homes, mainly in London and Birmingham. The new finance will be used to help complete networks designed to offer television and telephone services and possible acquisitions. By July the number of homes subscribing to modern cable networks had risen to more than 330,000 - an increase of 13.5 per cent over the previous three months.</p>

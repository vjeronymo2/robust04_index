			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kim Chung-kun from Beijing] </F>   [Text] It was learned on 26 May that Chinese President  Jiang Zemin will visit the ROK in November. His ROK visit will  be a return visit to President Kim Yong-sam's March visit to  China, and will be the first occasion for a Chinese president to  visit the ROK in the history of ROK-Chinese relations.    The ROK and Chinese Governments have continued negotiations  on President Jiang's ROK visit since 1992, when the two  countries established diplomatic ties and former President No  Tae-u visited China. They have recently made a rapid progress in  the negotiations and generally agreed to the principle that he  will visit the ROK in November.    According to the agreement, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister  Tang Jiaxuan will come to Seoul on 4 June to discuss with the  ROK Government the details of President Jiang's ROK visit.    While confirming Vice Minister Tang's planned visit to the  ROK, a Western source in Beijing said on 26 May: "I understand  that, during Vice Minister Tang's stay in the ROK, the two  countries will discuss various pending issues, including the  issue concerning President Jiang's ROK visit."    The source also said: "It is highly possible that President  Jiang Zemin will visit the ROK and Indonesia in succession."    Regarding this, a high-ranking source of China said on 26  May: "There will be no problem for the Chinese leader to visit  the ROK in the latter half of the year, in view of progress made  in resolving the North Korean nuclear issue." The source added:  "The Chinese leader's ROK visit will serve as a remarkable  turning point not only in the partnership between the two  countries, but also in relations between South and North Korea."</p>

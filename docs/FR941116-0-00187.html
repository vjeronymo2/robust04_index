However, so that no benefit will occur from the carryover, the producer may destroy the carryover under supervision of an employee of ASCS; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Not enrolled in the VPLP in the previous year but is enrolled in the current year, the carryover production from a previous crop year is eligible carryover and may be marketed, bartered, donated, or used during the current year without being counted against the PLQ for the current crop year; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Enrolled in VPLP in the previous year and is enrolled in ARP in the current year, the producer may devote an amount of acreage to conservation use acreage equal to the excess production divided by the PLQ yield for the crop and have the excess production considered eligible carryover.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Production harvested in excess of the PLQ may be stored up to but not more than 5 years. Any excess commodity stored longer than 5 years is subject to forfeiture to CCC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) The PLQ for a crop for a marketing year shall equal the product obtained by multiplying the acreage that would be permitted to be planted to such crop under the regular ARP conducted in accordance with part 1413 of this chapter by the PLQ yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)(1) The PLQ yield shall be calculated as the higher of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The farm program payment historic weighted yield for the crop determined in accordance with part 1413 of this chapter; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The average of the actual yields, as determined in accordance with &sect;1416.104 of this part, for the crop for the farm for each of the 1989 through 1993 crop years, excluding the crop years with the highest and lowest yields.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Any crop year in which the commodity was not planted shall be excluded.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Farms which have either, corn or grain sorghum CAB's, or both, and participate in the VPLP, shall have the PLQ calculated as corn equivalents by multiplying the combined permitted acreage of corn and grain sorghum times the corn PLQ yield.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)(1) If grain sorghum is harvested on the farm, grain sorghum production credited against the PLQ shall be determined by:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Dividing the corn yield by the grain sorghum yield; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Multiplying the factor determined in (g)(1)(i) of this section times the grain sorghum production (bushels) marketed, bartered, donated, or used on the farm.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The result is bushels of grain sorghum expressed in corn equivalents. Subtract this result from the PLQ for the combined permitted corn-grain sorghum PLQ to determine the quantity of corn eligible to be marketed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;1416.103  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Production evidence for actual yields.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The following provisions apply if producers elect to submit actual production for establishing actual yields for determining the PLQ in accordance with &sect;1416.102:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Production evidence for the enrolled program crop(s) must be submitted to County ASCS Offices on form ASCS&hyph;658, Record of Production and Yield. Additional evidence will be required if a representative of the county ASCS office determines there is insufficient evidence to support the representation of production or acreage of the crop on the farm as certified to by the producer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Producers with an interest in enrolled crops on more than 1 farm shall submit production evidence for all farms. The county committee shall determine whether evidence includes production from any other acreage for each year the evidence is provided.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Evidence for commercially stored production or production disposed of off the farm must show the:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Producer's name;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Commodity;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Buyer's or storer's name; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Date of transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Acceptable documents substantiating amounts of commercially stored or disposed of production include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Commercial or warehouse receipts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Sales or elevator receipts;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Warehouse ledger sheets or copies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Warehouse load summaries or copies;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Settlement sheets;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) CCC-warehouse stored loan documents;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Farm stored loan documents, if quantity has been determined by measurement;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Weight slips or scale tickets from harvested or appraised acreage;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

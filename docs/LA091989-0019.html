			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN BACKS WRIGHT FOR REELECTION TO ASSEMBLY  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Monday endorsed embattled Assemblywoman Cathie Wright  (R-Simi Valley) as she prepared for a primary election campaign against fellow  Republican Hunt Braly, who has said he will question her ethics and loyalty to  the GOP.  </P> <P> "Cathie Wright ought to be reelected. She has been a very staunch supporter of  ours and very helpful and cooperative, and she does an effective job for her  district," Deukmejian said.  </P> <P> Deukmejian made his comments outside a $100-a-head fund-raising dinner at a  Simi Valley hotel attended by more than 300 cheering Wright supporters. Wright  said she expected to raise $40,000 to $50,000 from the event.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's endorsement came as Wright braced for what could be a strong  challenge in the June, 1990, GOP primary election from Braly, chief of staff to  state Sen. Ed Davis (R-Valencia). Braly, who is expected to have Davis'  endorsement, said he has raised $65,000 for the race since late May.  </P> <P> Braly announced that he was seeking Wright's seat in May after Wright became  mired in allegations that she used her political clout in an effort to persuade  authorities to go easier on her and her 24-year-old daughter after they  received traffic tickets.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 10-Week Probe  </P> <P> After a 10-week probe, Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury concluded  that Wright "demonstrated a clear pattern" of attempts to get preferential  treatment for herself and her daughter. However, he said the assemblywoman  committed "no clear-cut criminal violations" that would warrant prosecution.  </P> <P> Among other allegations, Bradbury's 97-page report cited several instances in  which Wright was said to have tried to get police to void tickets issued to her  or her daughter, Victoria. It also said Wright discussed two of Victoria's  speeding citations with a judge at his home the day before he dismissed both  tickets in exchange for Victoria attending traffic school.  </P> <P> In addition to the ticket-fixing investigation, Cathie Wright absorbed a  significant amount of political flak in December, 1988, when she refused to  oppose Assemblyman Willie Brown's (D-San Francisco) reelection as Speaker,  antagonizing many fellow GOP lawmakers.  </P> <P> Most members of the Assembly Republican caucus lined up behind Assemblyman  Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier), one of five dissident Democrats who  repeatedly voted against Brown. Wright, however, abstained -- the only Assembly  member to do so in the tight speakership vote.  </P> <P> Wright explained that she promised constituents she would never vote for a  Democratic Speaker, but her abstention sparked a failed attempt by angry  Republicans to remove her from the powerful Assembly Rules Committee.  </P> <P> It was later revealed that Brown provided Wright with the name of a lawyer to  help with her daughter's ticket problems. The Speaker also telephoned a Ventura  County judge about the younger Wright in March, 1988, urging him to be lenient  with her for driving without a license.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Huge Boost'  </P> <P> One GOP lawmaker, who asked not to be identified, said Monday that the  governor's endorsement constituted a "huge boost" for Wright in her battle  against Braly, who has promised to question her links to Brown and her ethics  during the campaign.  </P> <P> Noting that Deukmejian is the party's leader and that his "personal ethics have  never been questioned," the legislator said the governor's blessing "reduces  the two key vulnerabilities Wright has among Republicans -- that she's not a  loyal Republican and that she's unethical."  </P> <P> But Braly attempted to minimize the significance of the gubernatorial  endorsement, saying that Deukmejian routinely makes campaign appearances on  behalf of GOP incumbents. He added that he does not think endorsements have  much effect on how voters cast their ballots.  </P> <P> Wright denied that the governor's appearance was an effort to offset possible  political damage resulting from Bradbury's allegations or the Brown  controversy.  </P> <P> "He offered to come so I took him up on his offer," she said. "I'm just  thrilled because the governor of the state of California is coming to my  hometown, Simi Valley."  </P> <P> Deukmejian declined to comment on the ticket-fixing inquiry. Asked by reporters  if he thought Wright was in trouble politically, he said: "Based on legislative  accomplishments, she shouldn't have any problem getting reelected. But she does  know you can't take anything for granted. You have to work hard, and you have  to have adequate resources, and I'm happy to be here to help her."  </P></p>

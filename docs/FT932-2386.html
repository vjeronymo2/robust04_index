			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (1): Bargains in the short term - If the US Congress ratifies the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating a common market of 357m people, it will have a profound impact on the way business is done IN THE waning days of the recession, business travellers to North America are already starting to look back with nostalgia to a time when air fares were cheap and hotels offered first-class pampering at steerage prices. In Canada and the United States, all that remains of the recession is a state of mind. Canada's growth rate is among the highest of the Group of Seven, the world's largest industrial democracies; while in the US, the recession ended technically more than a year ago, when economic output stopped shrinking. But the recovery, apart from a brief surge in growth at the end of last year, has been meagre. As a consequence of poor demand at home, prices have remained weak and competition for business is as fierce as ever. The threat of higher travel costs looms on the horizon, with signs that air fares and car rental rates are already on the rise. For the moment, however, North America remains a bargain destination, especially by world standards. This is borne out by the average per diem for a typical business traveller to New York of Dollars 297, including three meals and accommodation. A comparable business trip to Paris would set a company back Dollars 404, while expenses in London run to Dollars 316, according to studies by Runzheimer International, a specialist travel consultancy. And New York is the most expensive city in North America. An overnight trip to Chicago averages Dollars 218, slightly above Mexico City's Dollars 202. Costs in San Francisco and Los Angeles will run to Dollars 194, using summer rates. Atlanta is a more modest Dollars 165, while Canadian cities are downright cheap, with per diem costs of Dollars 155 for Vancouver and Dollars 150 for Toronto. Indeed, returning visitors to New York will find costs have risen by only Dollars 15-a-day since 1990, and other US cities have seen similarly modest cost increases. This is good news for business travellers, who can still expect to find bargains in lodging, food and car rental. In the 12 months to March 1993, Runzheimer found meal prices had edged 2 per cent higher, while lodging costs rose 1.9 per cent. Furthermore, average car rental prices dropped 10.7 per cent in the US in the same period and are now below 1988 levels. The bad news is that there are already signs of rising travel costs. At the four biggest car rental agencies, summer rates in general are running above last year's levels. Furthermore, air fares appear to be stabilising at higher levels. The US airline industry, which has haemorrhaged about Dollars 10bn in losses in the past three years, is making a concerted effort to staunch its losses by ending the vicious fare wars which helped push the industry into the red. According to Runzheimer, unrestricted coach-class fares jumped 38.7 per cent when analysed over 12 months to the end of this year's first quarter. Business discount fares were up only 0.6 per cent, while the lowest published adult fares rose 15 per cent. An early round of bargain summer fares led to some speculation that the higher fares wouldn't hold, but so far these cuts have been skirmishes rather than fare wars, and the discounts have not been as deep as in previous years. There is reason to believe that the days of inexpensive travel are over. To make matters worse, service on most airlines has suffered as a result of cost-cutting measures. Meals, in particular, have shrunk in recent years. While most carriers skimp on lettuce leaves and other trimmings (which can save an airline millions of dollars each year), some carriers are cutting back on their total meal service. Breakfast on a morning Northwest flight from New York to Detroit, for example, is a lone poppy-seed muffin, presented on a plate in its plastic wrapping. Until recently, North America was often used as a synonym for the United States, with Canada sometimes perceived as the 51st state. Mexico, with its more obvious cultural and linguistic differences, was often considered part of South America. This distorted view of the continent did a disservice both to the very real cultural differences between Canada and the US, and to the important connection between the three countries comprising the northernmost continent of the western hemisphere. First-time visitors to Toronto are often surprised to find that its spirit is closer to London than to neighbouring Detroit. Torontians shop at Marks and Spencer, drink their tea with milk, have access to a national healthcare system and abide by strict gun control laws. In Detroit, tea is served with lemon, and the lack of restrictions on gun ownership helps to account for one of the highest urban murder rates in the world. Similarly, Montreal, with its cafes and well-heeled women, seems closer to Paris than to the mingled French and Caribbean culture of New Orleans. Thanks to the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) between the US, Canada and Mexico, the world's perception of the continent may have changed for good. Although Nafta was signed last December by the trade ministers of Mexico, Canada and the US, it has yet to be ratified by Congress in the US. It is possible that political opposition in Canada and the US could still kill the agreement, but strong trade and investment ties have been forged already among the member nations. Canada and Mexico signed an earlier pact in 1990 to strengthen trade and investment ties. This has already engendered a number of agreements in areas ranging from forestry and agriculture to taxation and drugs. Canadian exports to Mexico are expected to approach the Dollars 1bn level this year, from about Dollars 780m a year ago. Moreover, the two countries are now negotiating a bilateral agreement on science and technology. A recent study by accountants Ernst &amp; Young found that Canada and Mexico receive a disproportionate amount of US projects in the fabricated metal, plastic and furniture sectors, compared with the rest of the world. In addition, food and paper industry investments tend to gravitate towards Canada; while Mexico attracts a disproportionate share of electrical, transportation equipment, clothing and glass projects. 'We expect these investments to increase at an even faster pace if the Nafta is enacted,' says James Buchanan, trade consultant at Ernst &amp; Young. If Nafta survives, next year may see the start of a common market with a population of 357m and a gross domestic product of Dollars 6,400bn. This compares with the European Community's population of 345m and gross domestic product of Dollars 3,000bn. Clearly, Nafta, if ratified, is likely have a profound impact on the way business is done in the region.</p>

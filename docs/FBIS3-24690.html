The meeting was chaired by Dr.  Jacques-Roger Booh Booh, the UN special representative to  Rwanda. [passage omitted]    We would like to inform you that there is tension caused by  ethnic rivalries in Kigali. People have started fleeing. The  gendarmerie and government troops are reportedly not useful in  any way. Instead, citizens in Kigali are asking the UN troops  to protect them as those of the government are not doing  anything to protect them.</p>

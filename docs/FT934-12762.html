			<p>931025 FT  25 OCT 93 / International Company News: Rhone-Poulenc warns of drop RHONE-POULENC, the French chemicals and pharmaceuticals group due to be privatised within the next few weeks, yesterday forecast that net profits would show a decline of about 30 per cent in the first nine months of the year, compared with the FFr1.11bn (Dollars 189.7m) reported in the same period in 1992. The group said full-year net profits were likely to be down by about the same proportion on 1992 net profits of FFr1.52bn. The company blamed the decline on what it described as the 'extremely poor economic climate affecting the chemicals and fibres market', which continued to depress volumes and prices. However, it said prices for several products had now stabilised. The agri-chemicals division also contributed to the decline in profits for the first nine months, as depressed demand arising from the European common agricultural policy and weakness in some geographical markets took their toll. On the bright side, its healthcare operations continued to show a strong increase over the same period in 1992, despite an expected slowdown after the first half. Sales of specialty chemicals also continued to resist the poor economic environment. Overall group sales declined by an estimated 4 per cent during the period, compared with the FFr61.95bn reported in the first three quarters of 1992. Operating income declined by about 18 per cent to some FFr4.6bn. Rhone-Poulenc said it had decided to release estimates of its results in the first nine months because of the impending privatisation. Currently, the company and the French government are in the process of forming a group of stable long-term share-holders, which will hold about 25 per cent of the shares following the sale of the government's 43 per cent stake.</p>

			<p><P> August 19, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HENDRIX, UNFILMED  </P> <P> Janis Joplin got the feature-film treatment in the fictionalized "The Rose"  (1979). Jim Morrison's life will be dramatized in Oliver Stone's upcoming "The  Doors." But a feature film about legendary rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix -- who  died in 1970 at 27 -- is still without voltage.  </P> <P> Alan Douglas, who supervises the production of the Hendrix music catalogues and  related merchandising (including the upcoming concert video of Hendrix's last  major concert -- at the Isle of Wight Festival), says he receives a steady  stream of scripts -- many of them from independent producers and "smaller  studios" that promise financing. At present, "a stack about 3 1/2 feet tall is  sitting in my office."  </P> <P> The problem is, says Douglas, "they all say the same thing -- nothing. We've  yet to see one that's got something to say about him that's special."  </P> <P> Douglas, who produced Band of Gypsies -- Hendrix's final group -- says there  were talks several years ago with Warner Bros. and various filmmakers. "But  nothing ever got going. I don't think anyone understood how to write the  story," says Douglas, who claims "Jimi was all music. That's what he was about.  Consequently, you don't have the colorful stories of a Jim Morrison or a Janis  Joplin. There are no sordid stories."  </P> <P> But, what about all those tales -- many of which have made their way into  assorted Hendrix bios -- about the sensuous rocker's appetite for women -- and  drugs?  </P> <P> "So what! The guy was a superstar at 25. Sure he had a lot of women. And, yeah,  he did drugs -- like everyone else. But his isn't the story of a junkie."  Stressing that Hendrix died of asphyxiation when he choked on his own vomit --  "not from a straight overdose" -- Douglas adds, "sex and drugs were a part of  the backdrop of the times. But they weren't what he was about."  </P> <P> Could it be that Douglas is being too protective of Hendrix?  </P> <P> "Of course I'm protective, in that I don't want some movie to go beyond the  truth in an attempt to find some offstage madness and satanic drama.  </P> <P> "Because that wasn't Jimi's story. Jimi changed the music. He's a reference  point to every musician who ever picked up an instrument. I haven't seen the  script that captures that part of Jimi, the metaphysical part that asks where  did the muse come from." Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

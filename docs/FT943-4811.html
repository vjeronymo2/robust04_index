			<p>940907 FT  07 SEP 94 / Arts: A seasonal display of dirty linen - Television Does anybody remember television quite as dreadful as we have been having for the past couple of weeks? Of course any week that contained the pilot for Chris Tarrant's game show (can that really be the right phrase?) The Opposite Sex would be pretty bad. The billing told us that couples would be 'airing their dirty laundry in public' and anyone who thought this was a subtle piece of wordplay indicating a stage beyond washing their dirty linen was rapidly disillusioned by the information that there would be 'a studio audience comprising of couples only'. Such solecisms should have served as a warning. Sure enough women were induced to object to men leaving the lavatory seat up, and men to complain about the time women took in preparing to go out. Goodness knows how the BBC justifies spending our licence fees on such trash. Nor was it just that. There have been dustbin loads of repeats and a poor response from news and current affairs programmes to the cessation of violence by Irish republican terrorists. Perhaps I was consistently unlucky, and it was like a game of Grandmother's Footsteps: every time I switched channels to find a better report, impressive activity promptly occurred behind my back. Maybe. But the reports I saw seemed wholly unprepared for what had happened, and obsessed with the absence of the word 'permanent' in the ceasefire declaration, virtually to the exclusion of all other considerations. In particular there was a marked failure to explain how this event had come about. Were the American visiting politicians influential? Was it John Major's doing? Had John Hume's work paid off? Having believed in violence for 25 years, why had the terrorists changed their minds? Not only did nobody seem to have the faintest idea, nobody on television seemed willing to ask. At other times of the year when there is so much more to distract the attention you might be able to get away with showing a ragbag collection of episodes from ancient ATV series, pretending you were serving a demand for retro television. After all, nobody accuses the National Film Theatre or the Hampstead Everyman of showing 'repeats'; they are in the serious sounding business of repertory cinema. However, there is an important difference. The NFT and the Everyman select the best of what has survived, whereas broadcasters usually seem perversely interested in the worst. It was not a bad idea to have Michael Grade interview his uncle for The Persuader: The TV Times Of Lord Lew Grade, because Lew Grade did have a significant effect on British television in the 1950s and 60s. Some of his series - The Muppet Show for instance, and The Prisoner - were unusual and well worth reviving. Moreover it was fascinating to see the episode of Danger Man in which Patrick McGoohan played a shadowy agent, sent abroad to a mysterious self-sufficient village where the mundane was overlaid with a powerful sense of sinister totalitarianism, since this was so clearly the model for The Prisoner in which McGoohan played the title role and also produced. There are no such good reasons for showing odd episodes from The Buccaneers, The Adventures Of William Tell, The Persuaders and a lot of other ATV series which are banal, repetitive and best forgotten. They looked like Polyfilla, shoved in to fill gaping summertime cracks. Is this all cause or effect? Are these heaps of repeats and ghastly pilots pushed at us in August because everybody who can afford to has left for Tuscany (or, for a touch of real class, Umbria) or do all those people shoot off to Italy because August is a dead month, not least on television? Whether the chicken or the egg came first, it is time the broadcasters gave up their nasty habits and accepted that even though Coronation Street attracts 'only' 16m viewers in August instead of 19m in the winter, 16m people are not to be sneezed at. Having said which, the autumn season is creeping in even as I write. Sunday brought the first of a new season of 'Screen One' filmed dramas on BBC1, A Breed Of Heroes, written by Charles Wood. Concerned with a British Army unit in Northern Ireland in 1971, this has been widely described as a comedy but is surely no such thing. Wood, a one-time regular soldier, seems to be simultaneously fascinated, impressed and appalled by professional soldiers and soldiering. He wrote the movie The Charge Of The Light Brigade and - his most outstanding work to date - Tumbledown. Like those, A Breed Of Heroes is concerned with the paradoxes of military behaviour: obedience and rebellion, valour and stupidity, brutality and compassion. The central character, young Lt Thoroughgood, is not the most memorable. It is Nicholas Farrell's Lt Col Gowrie who sticks in the mind, the man who is mad enough to scream at the gravy in the officers' mess but sane enough to declare of the local population 'I swear I'm going to make them behave like human beings'. The main mistake with this drama is to assume it is about Ireland: it is about the military mind. We have also seen the start of Channel 4's series 21st Century Airport, about Kansai International, which seems to be sailing dangerously close to hagiography where architect Renzo Piano is concerned; and, on BBC2, the first episode in the American comedy hit Murphy Brown. Given the scarcity of good comedy, it is difficult to understand the idea of screening this at a time - six o'clock on Mondays - when most people are still travelling home. Most promising of all we have seen the beginning of BBC2's eight-part series White Heat which is described as 'charting the history of technology' but which turns out to be nowhere near as dry and educational as that makes it sound. The opening episode made the point that the difference between man and other animals is not tool use (otters swim on their backs, holding flat stones on their chests to use as anvils for smashing open mussel shells) but the symbolism which is built into so many of man's tools, even when they are as seemingly utilitarian as, say, a gun. Tonight brings the first episodes in BBC1's new drama series about dustmen, Common As Muck, and ITV's drama about politics, sex scandals and arms dealing, Faith. Give the broadcasters a week or so and they will be lobbing new programmes at us so fast that none of us will be able to keep up. Politicians may have fought their way clear of the old boom-bust cycle but not broadcasters. This is the way they believe things should be: famine in August and glut in September.</p>

			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bank points to farm upheaval THE RADICAL changes sweeping UK farming have been highlighted by a report which estimates that more than 9,000 farms have gone out of production in the last five years. Most of the 1.4m hectares released has been swallowed up by other farms, according to the report by National Westminster Bank. The average UK farm is now 152 ha and has increased by 41 ha since 1987. The bank compiled its figures from questionnaires returned by 26,000 farmers who work more than 20 per cent of the UK's farmland. It believes that there will continue to be considerable concentration in the industry as the largest farms expand and the smallest ones shrink. Farmers under the age of 45 showed the greatest tendency to expand, and also the greatest move towards diversification, which the agriculture ministry has urged on the industry in the face of sharply falling farm incomes. More than half of all farms had diversified, with more than a third favouring contracting for other farmers. Second most popular diversification was the provision of holiday accommodation, followed by horse livery. The agriculture ministry is also urging farmers to co-operate in marketing. The bank survey found that while 16 per cent of arable and root crop enterprises are involved in co-operative marketing, only 12 per cent of livestock farmers are similarly involved. The larger the farmer, the more likely he is to be involved in co-operative marketing, said Mr Brian Montgomery, senior executive of the bank's agricultural office. The report suggests that there will be a 'missing generation' in the industry as nearly half the farmers questioned did not name a successor. 'Overall, a picture emerges of an industry in flux. Bedevilled by uncertainty but, with the right level of encouragement, poised to make the necessary structural and attitudinal changes,' the report concludes.</p>

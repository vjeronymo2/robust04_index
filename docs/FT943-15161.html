			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI Sir Colin Southgate's comments at Thorn EMI's annual meeting on Friday will be closely scrutinised. A demerger of the group he chairs into its music and TV rental components is looking more and more likely. Last month part of the troublesome defence electronics business was sold to France's Thomson. The remainder could find a buyer soon, removing the last big obstacle to demerger. Splitting Thorn EMI into two looks like a good idea. Investors interested in EMI would then be able to invest in an unadulterated music group. Given the worldwide enthusiasm for everything multimedia, it could trade on fancy multiples. The only major music group currently offering such a pure play is PolyGram. EMI could be more attractive since PolyGram's rating arguably suffers from the 75 per cent stake held by Philips. Unencumbered by its association with the dull rental business, EMI might also find it easier to branch out into book publishing and create a multi-faceted entertainment software group. Alternatively, EMI could be besieged by suitors wishing to include it in their multimedia empires. All this is heady stuff. Thorn EMI's shares rose 4 per cent at the end of last week as investors focused again on the demerger concept. The stock's outperformance since the start of the year has been largely driven by the same story. The idea is so appealing that a further rise could be justified. But if any hitches appear, the market will be sorely disappointed.</p>

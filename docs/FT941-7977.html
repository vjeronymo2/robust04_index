			<p>940222 FT  22 FEB 94 / Management: Difference between a profit and a loss - Exporting / A look at the benefits of export credit insurance It is easy enough to lose money by selling to a company in another town that suddenly goes bust. Suppliers suffer this indignity every week, in spite of increasingly sophisticated credit controls. To lose money when a customer overseas fails is even easier. The culture, language and local market are often relatively unknown to the new exporter. So reducing the risk by using export credit insurance is the obvious answer. Yet some exporters still claim it is expensive or unavailable in some parts of the world. This view is partially endorsed by Howard Davis, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. 'There have been some welcome improvements in cover and reductions in premiums,' says Davis. 'But in some markets UK support still compares unfavourably with that of the competition.' What is more, exporters say, the UK alone in the European Union does not supply state reinsurance support for short-term export credit. The government has extended 'transitional' cover until the end of 1997. This was put in place when part of the Export Credits Guarantee Department was privatised in 1991, but the lack of permanence is causing uncertainty. According to the leading insurance providers, Dutch-owned NCM and Trade Indemnity of the UK, about Pounds 25bn of a possible Pounds 35bn to Pounds 45bn of exports that could be insured is already benefitting from short-term cover. How much greater, some exporters ask, could UK exports be if the supply and cost of credit became easier? For smaller companies that do find the cover they require, the management of export insurance can still be difficult. 'The tricky thing for small companies is the need for detailed administration of your policy,' says Ian Campbell, director-general of the Institute of Exports. While the rules are clear, cover is often rendered invalid by customers who forget to provide details of transactions, exceed credit limits, deliver goods outside agreed dates or fail to report payment delays. Even experienced exporters often treat export credit insurance like a car policy that can be bought and forgotten. 'You cannot buy a credit insurance policy of any type and put it in the drawer and forget about it,' says Barbara Bennett, corporate relations manager at Trade Indemnity. 'You have to manage it alongside your credit controls.' Unlike car insurance, which is only pulled out when needed, export credit requires constant tinkering - changing credit limits, applying for new ones and pruning those which are no longer needed - if the costs are to be properly managed. So where should new exporters turn for advice and cover? There are two different forms of export credit insurance. Medium-term insurance covers sales or large projects when payment is expected over a two-year period or more. It attracts a lot of attention - and the bulk of the government's reinsurance through the official export credit insurer, the Export Credit Guarantee Department. But only a small number of companies use this form of cover. About 85 per cent of credit insurance is short-term cover. Since 1991, when the ECGD short-term insurance division was privatised, there have been two dominant credit providers - NCM, which bought the short-term credit business and is by far the largest, and the relative newcomer, Trade Indemnity. TI is the largest domestic credit supplier and has also moved into the export market. Both companies in theory cover exporters against losses up to 90 per cent of the value of invoices where a customer defaults, and up to 95 per cent if the customer is willing to pay but the country defaults, as was the case with Nigeria in 1983. Unless they are very big, exporters should not take their business directly to an insurer. The smallest exporters - with sales of Pounds 100,000 or less  -may find more appropriate managed policies provided by Intrum Justitia, CAD, part of the conglomerate BTR, or a limited number of banks. Here the exporter becomes the joint holder of a policy  - often reinsured with NCM - and can pay a lower premium than the insurer would have charged had it been handling the business directly. For larger exporters, it almost always pays to use a broker to approach the insurers. A good broker should be able to weed out classes of business that do not require insurance - sales to an associate company in another country, for example. And they should help in claims and managing credit lines, an area that too often receives little attention from exporters. In spite of the need for careful management of export insurance, the case for having it is irrefutable. A company earning 10 per cent profit margins, for example, which has a bad debt of Pounds 100,000, would have to make additional sales of Pounds 1m to make up the loss. Insurers say they do more than just provide cover. They can steer exporters towards or away from certain markets in addition to helping with the credit control function. 'There are benefits of credit insurance alongside a company's own credit management system,' says Colin Foxall, chief executive of NCM. 'There are very few cases where it would not make sense for an exporter to take credit insurance.'</p>

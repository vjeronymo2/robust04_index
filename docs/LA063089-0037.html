			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> MIG CRASH BLAMED ON BIRD  </P> <P> A Soviet MIG-29 jet fighter that crashed in flames at the Paris Air Show went  down because a small bird was sucked into its engine, a commission has  concluded. Specialists found feathers sticking to the wrecked engine's blades,  the newspaper Socialist Industry said, quoting the head of the French-Soviet  panel's Soviet contingent, Donat Ogorodnikov. The commission's findings  absolved the organizers of the June air show of all blame, the newspaper said.  </P></p>

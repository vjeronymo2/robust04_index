			<p>920601 FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (9): Ascent to Europe gets tougher - Economy ALONG with most of its European Community partners, Spain has prepared a plan ahead of the Lisbon summit at the end of the Portuguese presidency showing how it proposes to converge its economy towards the targets set by EC heads of Government in Maastricht last December. Unlike the rest of its partners, Spain is making a very big deal of its convergence plan. To the finance ministry, finally given the freedom by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez to deliver some well-aimed hammer blows at an inflationary service sector, the plan is a once in a lifetime opportunity. To the unions, it has rapidly become the sum of all fears. This is largely because the Finance Minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, has refused to confine the plan merely to meeting the Maastricht targets. Rather, the essence of his plan is not nominal, but what he calls real, convergence entailing, in other words, measures Spain would have to take in order to compete in an open market even if the EC did not exist. These measures come at the end of a 46 page outline plan published in April and, naturally for a ministry which knows it is about to stir up a hornets' nest, some of the writing is vague. It is, however, easy to cut through the fog. 'Reinforcing the job-seeking process', says the most important heading. This quickly boiled down to two points. First, Mr Solchaga was going to cut back on unemployment benefits and, second, double the amount of time required in work in order to qualify for the reduced benefit. In addition, an unemployed worker receiving benefit would have to take the first job on offer or have the benefit stopped. For a socialist government even to contemplate such an attack on one of the citadels of the welfare state has flabbergasted the unions, who are now threatening fierce retaliation. Mr Solchaga's response is simple. The unions were offered an opportunity to sign a three year wages pact last year and refused. And Spain's 16.3 per cent rate of unemployment is a sham and everyone knows it. At least a third of the unemployed work in the black economy and the system of paying incentives to industry to create jobs is being terribly abused. 'Economic deregulation measures', says the next sub heading. The text blandly adds that 'a good number of sectors which in the recent past have been inflationary have justified this by pointing to the existence of a collection of regulations and rules ..which have erected entry barriers and the proliferation of agreements which tend to divide up the market, to fix prices and to limit output, distribution and investment. Blood will flow here. Practically anyone who has a degree in Spain belongs to one kind or another of colegio which both protects their professional standing and limits their competitiveness. Thus, an architect living in Madrid and registered with the Madrid colegio will not be undercut on price by his fellows but he or she will not be able to bid for work outside of Madrid. Pharmacists in Spain have one of Europe's most jealously guarded monopolies. The colegios are powerful lobbies and are bound to resist any attempts to strip them of the regulations that allow them to exist. Nevertheless, Mr Solchaga has instructed a newly erected court at the industry ministry, the Tribunal for the Defence of Competition to spend this year pinpointing monopoly or restrictive practices among the professions and to report back in the final three months with recommendations about how to break them and, also, who should do it. Under 'Liberalisation Measures' Mr Solchaga tacitly conceded that reforming the professions might take time. But, the plan insists, there are 'some sectors in which reform cannot wait'. Most of these tend to be transport or communications of some sort over which the European Community has already agreed liberalising directives but which Spain has been late in implementing  -to Mr Solchaga's irritation. The most important, though, is the rapid dismantling of Telefonica's telecoms monopolies wherever they exist and the Government is about to grant new mobile operating licences to private bidders. 'Credit and insurance entities' announces the next heading. Although Spain's financial markets have been greatly streamlined and liberalised in the past few years, 'the priority now is to accelerate the transfer of the benefits of this greater economic freedom and competition to the customer'. Anyone who has had to wait three weeks for a Spanish bank to move an international cash transfer from its foreign department to a usable current account will know what this is about. The government also plans to draft new laws forcing insurers to do away with small print clauses which often impose absurd conditions on possible claimants. 'Public companies' is a bland enough introduction to another nightmare for the unions for under it Mr Solchaga announces a freeze, at current levels, of subsidies to the huge state industrial sector. 'This restriction will oblige these companies to substantially improve their management and, if this is not enough, to rescale their operations or, alternatively, raise capital in the debt markets or sell assets.' This is tough. Renfe, the state railway monopoly, lost more than Dollars 2bn last year. year. Iberia, the airline, has only made money once in the last five years. Any 'rescaling' of operations - job cuts - could invite union response throughout the state sector. 'Health'. The health service is the public sector's fastest growing loss maker, as the nation's 17 autonomous regions develop their own health care systems. Mr Solchaga, as in the case of the unemployment cutbacks, is able to instruct most spending ministries on what to do with the money he gives them. He has therefore forced a sweeping managerial shakeup in health care. 'The government considers it necessary to transform the current administrative model into a model of management services in which it is possible to identify the link between the quality of service and its cost.' Thus state hospitals will soon become individually managed and responsible for their own budgets. Obviously, hospitals will begin to look beyond Insalud, the central supplier of goods and services to hospitals, for competitors. None of this has anything to do with Maastricht, but the Finance Ministry is adamant that the 'real' convergence implied in the measures outlined at the back of its plan is the only way to guarantee that once Spain enters economic and monetary union, it can stay there. Officials say the nominal convergence detailed in the plan is of minor importance, though this is probably bravado. Fortunately, Spain has until the beginning of 1997 (the earliest date set for EMU) to bring its macroeconomic house into order. This is easily achievable even though, as officials admit, the plan sets out to deflate the economy while making it grow at least 1 per cent above the EC average every year for the next five. The targets are nevertheless impressive. Total public debt will fall from 4.4 per cent of GDP now to 1 per cent by the end of 1996. The economy will grow 3 per cent this year (a wildly optimistic projection, many economists suggest) and still be growing 3.5 per cent by the beginning of 1997. Unit labour costs will be growing at 2.3 per cent by the end of 1996 compared with 6.3 per cent at the end of last year and the deficit in the current account of the balance of payments will have fallen from nearly 3 per cent of GDP last year to 2.3 per cent. Scepticism about these figures is met with an indulgent smile at the ministry. As long as Spain grows more than the EC average, everything will be fine, comes the answer. If the five years since Spain joined the EC are any guide, then this is feasible, but the boom generated by adhesion is over. Clearly, then, the Spanish are banking on their ability to hold their EC partners to a promise, made at Maastricht, to create a cohesion fund to increase financing to poorer Community members who demonstrate that they are making a determined effort to wring inefficiencies out of their economies. The 'real' convergence proposals are designed to show Madrid's partners that it is doing just that and that it is not simply coming to the table to beg for more. But the Spanish have become alarmed at the reluctance of the Germans even to discuss implementing the Maastricht Treaty protocol dealing with cohesion. And even worse, the Portuguese presidency of the community for the first half of 1992 has refused to call a special meeting of EC leaders to discuss it. Spain had been hoping that Portugal, as a fellow poor southern member, would be interested in cohesion. It seems, though, that as direct flows of EC funds account for about 5 per cent of Portugal's GDP (and less than 1 per cent of Spain's), Lisbon is not going to tamper too much with the current system. Worse, for Spain, is that Britain takes over the presidency from Portugal for the rest of the year and London is also highly unlikely to have cohesion near the top of its agenda. But without the cohesion money Spain hoped would be forthcoming, its convergence plan begins to look extremely ambitious and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is going to have to use all the charm he can muster to squeeze it out of his European community friends.</p>

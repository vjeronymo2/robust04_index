			<p><P> July 27, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BACK TO BASICS: BLANCHING: CRITICAL STEP FOR FROZEN VEGETABLES  </P> <P> Blanching, or scalding, is a critical step in preparing fresh vegetables for  freezing. This process cleanses the vegetable surfaces of dirt and organisms,  brings up their color, helps retain vitamins and reduces the action of enzymes  that otherwise would destroy their fresh flavor after about a month in the  freezer.  </P> <P> The fresher the vegetables are when frozen, the more satisfactory the end  product. Choose those at their peak of ripeness and process them as soon as  possible.  </P> <P> Freezing retards the growth of bacteria but does not sterilize the food.  Therefore, sanitary measures in the handling and processing of foods are very  important.  </P> <P> Before blanching, wash, drain, sort, trim and cut the vegetables the same as  you would if you were cooking them fresh. Use one gallon of water to blanch  each pound of vegetables -- two gallons for a pound of leafy greens.  </P> <P> </P> <P> It's All in the Timing  </P> <P> Place the vegetables in a wire basket and lower it into vigorously boiling  water (Step 1). Begin counting the blanching time as soon as the vegetables  enter the water. Keep the heat on high and stir the water or cover the  container during blanching.  </P> <P> Time the blanching carefully, using the following chart. Under-blanching  stimulates enzyme activity rather than reducing it; prolonged scalding causes  loss of vitamins, minerals, flavor and color.  </P> <P> Remove the vegetables from the boiling water and immediately plunge into ice  water (Step 2) to stop the cooking process. Stir the vegetables as they cool  for approximately the same amount of time they were blanched. If more than one  batch of vegetables is being prepared, the hot vegetables may be poured into a  colander set in the ice water so the wire basket can be reused.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Airtight Packaging  </P> <P> Pack the cooled vegetables loosely into moisture-and-vapor-proof containers  (Step 3). Seal, label with the contents and date (Step 4), then place the  containers in a single layer in the freezer, leaving about one inch of space  between the packages so they freeze quickly. Once completely frozen, packages  may be compactly stacked. Frozen vegetables should be used within one year.  </P> <P> When large quantities of vegetables are being processed, determine the amount  that can be blanched in 15 minutes and keep the remainder under refrigeration  until the first batch has been packaged. The same scalding water may be reused  for the same product, adding water as needed to retain the proper level.  </P> <P> The following timetable for blanching vegetables prior to freezing comes from  the "Handbook of Food Preparation," published by the American Home Economics  Assn.  </P> <P> Asparagus  </P> <P> Small stalks -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Medium stalks -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Large stalks -- 4 minutes  </P> <P> Beans, lima  </P> <P> Small beans or pods -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Medium beans or pods -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Large beans or pods -- 4 minutes  </P> <P> Beans, green or wax -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Beets  </P> <P> Small -- 25 to 30 minutes  </P> <P> Medium -- 45 to 50 minutes  </P> <P> Broccoli florets (1 1/2 inches) -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Brussels sprouts  </P> <P> Small heads -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Medium heads -- 4 minutes  </P> <P> Large heads -- 5 minutes  </P> <P> Cabbage, coarse shreds or thin wedges -- 1 1/2 minutes  </P> <P> Carrots  </P> <P> Small whole -- 5 minutes  </P> <P> Diced, sliced, strips -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Cauliflower, 1 inch pieces -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Celery, 1 inch lengths -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Corn, sweet, on the cob  </P> <P> Small ears (1 1/4-inches or less in diameter) -- 7 minutes  </P> <P> Medium ears (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter) -- 9 minutes  </P> <P> Large ears (over 1 1/2 inches in diameter) -- 11 minutes  </P> <P> Whole kernel and cream style -- 4 minutes (cooking time before kernels are cut  off cob)  </P> <P> Greens  </P> <P> Beet, chard, kale, mustard, spinach, turnip -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Collards -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Kohlrabi  </P> <P>  1/2-inch cubes -- 1 minute  </P> <P> Whole, small to medium in size -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Okra  </P> <P> Small pods -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Large pods -- 4 minutes  </P> <P> Parsnips, 1/2-inch cubes or slices -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Peas  </P> <P> Black-eyed -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Green -- 1 1/2 minutes  </P> <P> Peppers  </P> <P> Halves -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Slices -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Pumpkin -- until soft  </P> <P> Rutabagas, 1/2-inch cubes -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Squash  </P> <P> Tender-skinned -- 3 minutes  </P> <P> Hard-shelled -- until soft  </P> <P> Sweet potatoes -- until almost tender  </P> <P> Tomato juice (simmer tomatoes) -- 5 to 10 minutes  </P> <P> Turnips, 1/2-inch cubes -- 2 minutes  </P> <P> Note: It is not necessary to blanch rhubarb, peppers, onions and herbs used  exclusively for flavoring.  </P> <P>  Suggestions for column topics may be sent to Back to Basics, Food Section, The  Times, Times Mirror Square, Los Angeles 90053.  </P> <P> </P></p>

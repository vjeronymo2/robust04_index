			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Zepce, Bosnia-Herzegovina, March 10 (AFP)--Serb  forces blocked Thursday a UN aid convoy to the besieged Moslem  enclave of Maglaj but UN troops said the impasse would be  resolved soon. [passage omitted]    The commander of a 150-man Company C Light Dragoons  reconnaissance unit said Serb forces had Wednesday asked convoy  leaders to sign "a disclaimer saying they would take  responsibility" for the aid trucks and personnel if they entered  the Maglaj area. The disclaimer meant that Serb troops would not  be responsible if something happened to the aid workers. The  commander, who spoke to AFP on condition that he not be named,  said the UNHCR officials refused to do this.    He confirmed reports of recent fighting in the area and said  that he had himself heard from Zepce the sounds of up to 10  shells a minute falling on Maglaj which has been under a Serb  siege since June. This matches reports from the mainly Moslem  government's Radio Sarajevo which has spoken of days over the  past two weeks when up to 4,000 shells fell on Maglaj.    Several UNHCR convoys have been kept from reaching Maglaj.  The one blocked Thursday left Banja Luka in northwest Bosnia  last week and has been stopped at Teslic for several days.  [passage omitted]    Maglaj has not received humanitarian aid by land since last  October. It depends on NATO airdrops of food but UNHCR  officials have said the situation there is desperate. UNHCR  director for Bosnia Larry Hollingworth was Thursday north of  Zepce trying to arrange for the convoy, Croatian military  commander for the region Niko Jozinovic told AFP. He did not  say exactly what Hollingworth was doing. UN officials said  requests had been made to Bosnian Serb military leader General  Ratko Mladic in Pale, near Sarajevo in central Bosnia, to give  the convoy authorization for Maglaj. Jozinovic said his HVO  forces, which have positions between Zepce and Maglaj, were not  involved in the fighting. He said, however, that Serb troops  did pass through territory held by the HVO. "It is necessary to  put pressure on the Serb side to end this war," Jozinovic said.  He said the Moslem-Croat ceasefire in effect in central and  southern Bosnia was holding for the Maglaj area as well. "In the  next 20 days, this war will stop," Jozinovic said through an  interpreter.    Elsewhere in northern Bosnia, mine-clearing operations by  UNPROFOR continued at the Tuzla airbase to prepare it for  international aid flights. The 2,400 metre (3,000 yard) runway  was also being swept while Bosnian workers dismantled runway  lighting.    Wednesday night was extremely calm, a spokesman for  UNPROFOR's Nordic battalion said, following the firing of three  mortar bombs on the town of Tuzla by besieging Serb forces which  killed a man and his young son. Another UNPROFOR officer said  there had been sounds of shellfire and automatic weapons from  the mainly-Moslem Bosnian Army lines some eight kilometres (five  miles) away.    In Zagreb UNPROFOR spokesman Michael Williams said no date  had yet been fixed for opening the airfield, closed since the  beginning of the war nearly two years ago, under an agreement  concluded with the Bosnian Serbs. "We still have no definite  date," said Williams. "There are still questions about possible  presence of liaison officers on the airport, from the Serbian  side and the Bosnian side."    On Wednesday UNPROFOR's military spokesman, Lieutenant  Colonel Jean Marcotte, said the UN would like to start aid  flights within a week, though new equipment for the airport to  operate them would have to be flown in first. "Requests for  equipment assistance have already gone out. We are pleased with  the response that we've met to that," Williams said.</p>

Scott Monroe Nelson, 55, telephoned a local newspaper from  the nearby town of Tagum to announce that he had just been freed  unharmed by unidentified men who snatched him in Davao on  December 28 and freed him early Wednesday. He later arrived  with Tagum police at the regional police headquarters in Davao,  located about 950 kilometers (600 miles) south of Manila, to pay  a call on officials who had been stumped by his disappearance.    The Houston, Texas native told police that two gunmen forced  him into a car in Davao on December 28 and transported him  blindfolded outside the city. He said they stripped him of  2,200 dollars in travellers cheques, 200 dollars in cash and two  gold rings and kept him in a windowless room until his release.    Police had expressed skepticism over the case when a woman  claiming to be Nelson's girlfriend reported he had been  kidnapped, but could not pinpoint the place where it happened.  She also claimed Nelson had been snatched on orders of his  estranged Filipina wife, who lived in another city.    "We are still investigating," police superintendent Filipino  Amogis said.</p>

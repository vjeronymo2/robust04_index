			<p>BFN        [Text] Our correspondent in Aden reported a short time ago  that fire is illuminating Aden's sky because of missiles being  fired by the southern forces to down northern forces' missiles.    The corredspondent affirmed that the vice president of the  proclaimed Presidential Council in Aden, 'Abd-al-Rahman  al-Jifri, contacted him a short while ago asking that an appeal  be addressed through the MBC to the international community to  halt the war. This comes after the northerners pounded the city  of al-Waht 60 km from Aden.    Al-Jifri said the attack on al-Waht killed and wounded many  of its residents and displaced those who survived. He appealed  to humanitarian organizations to supply Aden with doctors and  medical aid.</p>

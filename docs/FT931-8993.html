			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / London braced for widespread hospital closures LONDON faces widespread hospital closures under a government strategy, announced yesterday, which aimed at the same time to defuse opposition to the restructuring. Final decisions on the most sensitive hospital closures recommended in Sir Bernard Tomlinson's report on London health care will not be made until after further reviews and consultations later this year. The announcement by Mrs Virginian Bottomley, the health secretary, does not amount to a reprieve for threatened hospitals such as St Bartholomew's and the Charing Cross, even though the government has feared that closing famous institutions would cause a political storm. Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow health secretary, described her statement as a 'damp squib with a long fuse attached to a powder keg of cuts and closures'. Mrs Bottomley made it clear last night that the London restructuring proposals would not be considered by ministers as a single package again. Decisions on the future of individual hospitals would be taken separately. Threatened institutions - faced with fragmented decision-making and an uncertain timetable - will find it difficult to maintain the high-profile level of campaigning that preceded yesterday's announcement. The government has accepted the broad conclusions of the Tomlinson report - that up to 2,500 inner-London hospital beds should be shed over the next five years, with resources diverted to family doctor and community services. Mrs Bottomley announced plans for Pounds 170m capital expenditure on improving local medical services in inner London during the next six years, plus Pounds 40m extra revenue expenditure next year. Several innovations are planned, including the introduction of salaried general practitioners to improve inner London's family doctor services. 'London deserves the radical overhaul which, over the years, many have promised but none has delivered,' Mrs Bottomley said. The long-standing financial problems of the capital's teaching hospitals have been brought to a head by the 1991 health reforms, which are leading to health authorities outside inner London treating more patients locally. Government subsidies of Pounds 50m have been spent on covering the London hospitals' lost income this financial year, and this is likely to double next year. The future of Bart's is highly doubtful. Ministers are considering three options for the famous City hospital. These are closure; amalgamation with the Royal London; or scaling down to a much smaller specialist hospital. The government stressed, however, that a scaled-down specialist Bart's would need a cost-base acceptable to purchasers in the NHS market. Prof Michael Besser, chief executive of Bart's, said: 'In essence the options put forward by the secretary of state suggest that the government is intent on closing Bart's one way or another.'

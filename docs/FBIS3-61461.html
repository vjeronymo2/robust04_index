Sutkovoy; UDC 537.312.62]    [Abstract]A study of the characteristics of a relaxation  SQUID magnetometer is performed. Two modifications are made to  the base- line system of the SQUID by introducing an additional  inductive coupling for the interferometer with power bus and a  shunting circuit. The experimental results conformed to the  theoretical analysis and showed the positive influence of these  modifications in the form of an increased conversion  coefficient, and a reduction in the effect of unstable power  current and external interference. This reduces requirements  established for the power circuits and for shielding the  electronic components of the SQUID from external magnetic  interference for magnetometers operating under high interference  and on an unstable power line. The proposed correction for the  control characteristic of the relaxation SQUID may be used to  improve precision and accuracy characteristics of SQUID  magnetometers. Figures 5; references 10.</p>

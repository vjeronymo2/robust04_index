			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Pharmaceuticals Glaxo's accumulation of a large cash pile may look odd for a company with such declared faith in the future of research. The impending legal judgment on the validity of the US patent for Zantac, the world's biggest-selling drug which accounts for about two-thirds of Glaxo's profits, may be a partial explanation. The derating of earnings from Zantac ahead of the court case has certainly contributed to the weakness of the shares, which now account for 4 per cent of the FT-SE 100 index, down from 7 per cent at the peak. If Zantac is open to generic competition, sales and profits would be quickly eroded. While a Pounds 1.5bn cash pile looks excessive by most standards, the group's research effort would consume as much within three years. That would be a valuable breathing space should the worst happen. If Zantac's future is secured, though, adding to the cash pile will be more difficult to justify. An acquisition outside ethical pharmaceuticals has been ruled out. The choice is thus between ploughing more into research - directly or by acquisitions in, say, biotechnology - or distributing more to shareholders. The dilemma is by no means unique to Glaxo. In the short term other drugs companies can legitimately argue that cash is an advantage as the industry restructures. Merck's acquisition of Medco, the drugs distributor, is a case in point. But if earnings growth from pharmaceuticals is going to be lower than in the past, the case for providing higher investment returns by way of yield is compelling.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Igor Belskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 18 Jan (ITAR-TASS) -- The leaders of the  Democratic Russia movement declared that they are moving across  to the antigovernment camp. Following ultimatums on the  membership of the government, the Coordinating Council of  Democratic Russia announced today that it will act "as an  opponent to the course of the government headed by Viktor  Chernomyrdin."    The statement says that Russia is leaving the course of  reform. The leaders of Democratic Russia believe that this is  borne out by Yegor Gaydar's refusal to join the new government.  "Gaydar's departure is in line with events and confirms the  general tendency toward curtailing the course of reform in the  country," the statement says.    The leaders of Democratic Russia are threatening to organize  statements in the press, and also to hold mass acts of protest  against the government's policies. The first meeting of  Moscow's public has been set by the leaders of Democratic Russia  for 22 January.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" report by Mary Simon] </F>   [Text] Geneva -- The UN Development Program (UNDP) has  proposed a complete renovation of aid to further growth through  the reduction of military expenses. The proposal is based on the  fact the post Cold War period has not favored the financing of  programs to protect humanity.    Although the 1994 UNDP Human Development Report assesses  that  military expenses in industrialized countries were reduced 3.6  percent between 1987 and 1991, it considers the so-called peace  dividends, which totaled approximately $935 billion, were not  used to finance social development programs or to give security  to the human race itself.    In its preceding report, the one for 1993, the UNDP had  stressed the differences that existed in Mexico between the  people in Chiapas State and those in the richest areas of the  country. On that occasion, it somewhat sounded an alert to the  situation and forecast the social explosion that occurred when  Mayan peasants revolted against the state administration and the  Mexican Government seven months later, on 1 January 1994.    After confirming its prediction that large gaps in human  development can lead to civil conflict, the 1994 document  asserts the Chiapas experience constitutes a disquieting  reaction.  <H5>  Human security </H5>   The UNDP urges giving much more importance to human security  than to hackneyed national security, on which the developed  world spent approximately $815 billion in 1992. Developed  countries used $125 billion in this sector, but those funds were  almost all drawn from resources assigned to social programs at a  human cost of vast, fatal consequences.    By proposing a type of alert system to forecast cases of  national disintegration, such as Somalia, the report expresses  doubt that all the resources assigned to military spending have  increased security for the average citizen of the world.    In developing countries, the probabilities of dying from  social abandonment, malnutrition, and preventable sicknesses are  33 percent higher than the those of dying in a war caused by  foreign aggression.    The relation between those expenses and the social costs in  the GNP can be appraised by the fact that 1 billion people never  see a health professional, more than 2 million children die of  preventable, contagious diseases, with another 192 million  facing malnutrition, and that 1.3 billion additional people  suffer the effects of not having available drinking water.    Furthermore, 900 million citizens of those countries do not  know how to read or write; 30 million children do not attend  grade school, and, regarding the population cost, almost another  3 billion people live in countries where yearly demographic  growth exceeds 2 percent.    The United States spends an average of $290 billion in  defense every year, while crime within its borders costs $425  million, as well as many lives. The UNDP believes the situation  is bad for white people but much worse for blacks.    According to this organization, one-third of white people  live in areas contaminated by carbon monoxide, but the  proportion is close to 50 percent for blacks, and the  unemployment rate for blacks is double that for whites.    Indicating that human insecurity is a universal problem, the  UNDP stresses the fact that poor countries are much more  concerned about hunger and sicknesses, while the rich ones are  kept awake by drugs and crime.    Approximately $460 billion could be obtained to perk peace  during the period of 1995 to 2000 if military expenses  throughout the world are decreased 3 percent a year, but there  has to be a guarantee those resources will actually end up as  funds to further development.  <H5>  A New Criterion for Cooperation </H5>   The formulation of a new criterion for cooperation, which  ties reductions in military expense to a world pact favoring  human development, is based on the need to find ways to share  responsibilities. This implies new international agreements to  replace those that the UNDP believes have an obsolete foreign  aid criterion, so as to satisfy the new demands for human  security, the focus of the organization's initiatives for 1994.  According to this concept, the industrialized countries would  pay for specific benefits, and the developing countries would  also be obligated to reform their economies and government  policies. Such ideas, akin to the new perspective that emerged  from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) Summit  held in Cartagena de Indias in 1992, address the issue of this  new association for development.    The UNDP recognizes, however, that the manner in which aid  is  currently assigned still bears the scars of the so-called Cold  War, when aid was reserved for strategic allies more frequently  than it was assigned to truly poor countries.    A brief overview of the traditional handling of this type of  aid also reflects varied concepts of implementation. Thus,  while Egypt receives official aid from donor countries that  amounts to approximately $280 per poor person, India receives  only $7. Only 7-percent of aid given from government to  government is assigned to human priorities such as basic  education, elementary health attention, and water supply in  rural areas, among others mentioned in the report.    The proposed UNDP pact establishes, generally, that poor  countries as well as the rich ones promise to help satisfy the  basic needs previously enumerated. The focus of the UNDP  initiative is based on a multidimensional vision of  developmental cooperation, a concept used in the past only to  define foreign aid.    According to the viewpoint which the report endorses,  northern and southern countries are intrinsically linked by  other cultural, political, and economic factors. It is a fact,  it states, that North-South aid is usually only a small part of  other types of international financial flows.    Foreign aid to developing countries totaled $60 billion in  1992, but the flow of private capital to the South increased to  $102 billion that same year and had amounted to only $5 billion  in 1990. What is more significant, however, is that  three-fourths of that capital only goes to a dozen countries.  They are, in decreasing order: China, Mexico, Malaysia,  Argentina, Thailand, Indonesia, Brazil, Nigeria, Venezuela, and  Korea. Only 6 percent is designated for sub-Saharan Africa and  2 percent for less developed countries.    The UNDP proposal includes the concepts of an international  system for minimum social security, compensation systems, and  international institutions.    The first system will be financed with a world revenue tax  of  approximately 0.1 percent, which will yield $20 billion a year,  to be imposed on countries with a per capita GNP of more than  $10,000, to the benefit of, the UNDP believes, those countries  that register a per capita GNP of less than $1,000. If this  mechanism is not approved, the UNDP suggests the alternative  option: that the current Official Aid for Development reserve an  amount equivalent to 0.1 percent of the GNP for the poorer  countries.    Regarding compensation, the UNDP is studying ways to form  new  associations between the rich and the poor. For example, the  first could pay the poor for the destruction of nuclear weapons,  the struggle against contagious diseases, the elimination of  drugs, and the improvement of the planet's environment. The  UNDP also suggests the future International Commerce  Organization (OMC) establish a compensation program to be used  when a country causes damage to others.    Finally, this new form of cooperation must be equipped with  new organizations in the UN system. Thus, an Economic Security  Council, a World Central Bank, an International Investments  Fund, the future OMC, and a World Antimonopoly Directorate  should be created. All those proposals will be broached at the  World Conference on Human Development scheduled for 1995.</p>

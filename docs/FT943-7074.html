			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Suitable schemes for cutting: Lisa Wood says it may be difficult to identify savings in the UK publicly funded training budget Mr Tony Cann, a Lancashire businessman, shakes his head at reports that Mr Michael Portillo, UK employment secretary, wants to slash the government's Pounds 1.8bn training budget. 'The free market will not sort out the training of young people and unemployed adults who are the main recipients of government-funded programmes,' says Mr Cann, chairman of East Lancashire Training and Enterprise Council (Tec), one of 82 in England and Wales which administer publicly funded training on behalf of the employment department. The Tecs, independent companies run by private-sector business leaders, have been thrust into the spotlight by recent, unconfirmed newspaper reports that Mr Portillo wants to halve their training budget. The debate over their future will be fuelled today when league tables are published showing how successful they have been over the past year in finding jobs for, and improving the skills of, unemployed people. Mr Portillo, a standard-bearer of Thatcherite ideas and a keen supporter of freeing labour markets from state involvement, has made no comment about possible cuts; neither has he squashed media speculation. As the government approaches its autumn spending review and looks for ways to cut the Pounds 50bn public-sector borrowing requirement, however, Mr Portillo is thought to be seeking ways to save some of his department's overall annual spending of Pounds 3.7bn. Officials in his department say that he has asked them to detail expenditure on training programmes, and to assess both their value for money and the possible political reaction were training budget cuts to be agreed in the public expenditure negotiations. 'We are at the shadow-boxing stage with the Treasury,' said one official. Any cuts in the training budget would be at the expense of the Tecs, which the government set up four years ago to take over the administration of publicly funded training. The two main schemes administered by the Tecs are Youth Training, a programme for young people with guaranteed places, and Training for Work, for long-term unemployed adults. Most have been jobless for more than a year. Tecs, which receive most of their Pounds 1.8bn funding for these two programmes, are allotted individual budgets under complicated formulas which take into account the levels of unemployment in their areas. So how much scope is there for savings in the Department of Employment's training budget? And is the government prepared to curb the state's role in training amid general acknowledgement by industry that the UK's underskilled workforce is putting the country at a competitive disadvantage? Speculation about Mr Portillo's agenda at his new department has been stoked by comments from a small group of rightwing Tory backbenchers, determined to minimise the role of the state. Mr Nick Budgen, a maverick rightwinger, is sceptical about the role of government in training. Offering training schemes to upgrade skills, he says, was intended only as a temporary measure in the 1970s. 'Now,' he says, 'training by the state is applauded as a permanent part of the economy. I want to question that.' This reappraisal has not been on the political agenda for several years. Tory and Labour governments since the early 1970s have accepted that the state has a significant role to play in training the unemployed. Sustained economic growth alone is not seen as the solution to long-term unemployment, while market forces tend to under-provide the skills needed for workers to compete in an increasingly demanding jobs environment. This view of the importance of state backing found some support in the recent white paper on competitiveness, published in May by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. It said that government-backed training formed part of the 'active measures' that a flexible labour market needs to help unemployed people back into work. Mr Portillo's expenditure review will not only consider the strength of this argument but try to ascertain whether the two main Tec schemes offer value for money. It will focus first on Youth Training. Despite the 'guarantee' of a place for any young person that wants one, some 59,000 young people are estimated to be falling through the net - neither on a YT course, nor in a job. One of the main reasons that young people do not take up a YT place concerns the benefit allowance. If they receive training but no offer of a job, they are entitled to a state allowance of Pounds 29.50 a week, a sum which many consider too low. Were it to be cut, Mr Peter Ashby, of Full Employment UK, an employment consultancy, says: 'The YTs' reputation will fall further, with more young people joining those who drop out.' Mr Ashby points out that the government plans to upgrade training for young people with the introduction of 'modern apprenticeships'. These aim to provide higher skills than currently achieved through YT. Mr David Hunt, shortly before the cabinet reshuffle which ended his term as employment secretary, pledged extra government funding for this more expensive programme, also to be administered by Tecs, to encourage employers to take on trainees. Any cuts Mr Portillo might contemplate in the scheme, would undermine what the government sees as a flagship venture. The main area which Mr Portillo is likely to look at, therefore, is the Pounds 705m-a-year Training for Work scheme for unemployed adults, which replaced Employment Training last year. The programme has been criticised for several failings - even by some Tecs, which suggest that fewer people should be accepted on the scheme but more money should be spent on training individuals, who receive Pounds 10 a week plus their unemployment benefits. Detractors, including Labour MPs such as shadow transport secretary Mr Frank Dobson, a former employment spokesman, claim that fewer than a third of participants get jobs. However, the league tables to be published today may dispel some of the criticisms about the performance of Training for Work. Most Tecs are expected to show improvements in finding jobs for the unemployed, despite progressive cuts in funding to programmes for the unemployed over the past three years. Mr Mike Nixon, chief executive of North London Tec, which now gets 54 per cent of Training for Work participants into a job compared with 10.65 per cent when it inherited the scheme, says: 'TFW is now looking good.' In his search for savings, Mr Portillo may decide that cheaper, non-training alternatives to Training for Work offer one solution. Job Clubs, for example, provide short courses where the unemployed learn basic skills to 'enhance their job-hunting techniques', such as how to fill out a curriculum vitae. The clubs seek to get people back into work quickly without upgrading their work skills. Employment department officials will probably tell Mr Portillo that it is difficult to compare the long-term success of training schemes with that of Jobclubs. It may initially be cheaper to get an unemployed person back into work through a Jobclub, but many such jobs are short-lived, while an individual whose skills have been upgraded may get a better-paying, permanent job. Employment department officials believe the trade-offs between funding and jobs are more complex than they may appear. The employment secretary will have to weigh up the relative gains provided to the individual and to the overall UK economy by publicly funded training schemes. Even if he decided to slash the Pounds 705m cost of Training for Work tomorrow, the government would still be faced with a massive unemployment benefits bill. In addition, about a quarter of the UK's training budget for unemployed adults comes from the European Union, which would be lost if the Tecs' main scheme was axed. Mr Portillo's cost-cutting choices will thus be limited. Some Tecs could undoubtedly improve their performance, but cutting the amount they can spend on unemployed individuals may not enhance their success rate. Mr Chris Humphries, policy director of the Tecs' National Council, says: 'I believe the league tables will show substantial improvements. We hope that this will be acknowledged by maintenance of budgets, not cuts.'</p>

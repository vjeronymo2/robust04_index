			<p>BFN     [Text] The absolute majority of signatories are ready to  put their signatures under the agreement on civic accord. This  opinion was voiced by Ivan Rybkin, speaker of the Federal  Assembly's lower chamber, in a conversation with journalists  after the meeting between Russian president and leaders of the  State Duma factions.    He assessed the president's decision to cancel decree No  1590  as a move of conciliation (the participants of the meeting were  informed about this during the meeting). As it is known, "a  black list" of former deputies of the Supreme Soviet disbanded  by the presidential decree No 1400 due to their participation in  the October events in Moscow was compiled on the basis of this  decree.    In Rybkin's words, they have reached an agreement that all  leaders of the State Duma factions will be granted an  opportunity to express their point of view regarding the  agreement on civic accord over the first channel of the  Ostankino TV company.    While informing the State Duma deputies on the results of  the  meeting, Rybkin reported that on April 25 the Federation Council  should determine whether it would commission Chairman of the  Federation Council Vladimir Shumeyko to sign the document along  with the constituent members or whether it would be enough if  the constituent members put their signatures under this document.    Aleksandr Piskunov (New Regional Policy group) reported that  there are already 140 constituent members ready to sign this  agreement, including all constituent members of the Russian  Federation. As he said, it would take two days to revise the  document.    Yevgeniy Novikov, member of the working group in charge for  the preparation of the document (Party of Russian Unity and  Concord faction) reported that the president assessed the  question on possible political persecution of those who would  not sign the agreement on civic accord as "absolute nonsense."  In his words, Yeltsin declared that he would not change his  attitude to any parties if they do not sign this document.    Sergey Shakhray, leader of the Party of Russian Unity and  Concord, believes that April 28, the day of signing, is "the  beginning of a difficult, long, and tiring process in the search  for an accord."    Shakhray believes that if the Duma votes against the singing  of this document this will be unnatural because the Duma itself  started this process by adopting the memorandum on accord on  February 23. In addition, when the president, the government,  the constituent members, and trade unions sign this document,  the absence of the State Duma could lead "to self-isolation of  the chamber."    Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia,  believes that signing would take place and "the absolute  majority" would sign the agreement. In his opinion, if there is  at least one percent of something which can reconcile the  society, it should be used."    Leader of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russian Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy reported to journalists that his faction would  consider the issue at its sitting scheduled for April 26. At  the same time he did not declare that he does not intend to sign  this document because, as he said, signing is quite possible "as  a compromise for further movement forward." He reported that he  had presented his point of view regarding the concept of the  country's development and agreed to privately meet with the  president.    "If several opposition factions do not sign this agreement  it  will be a norm of democratic life," Zhirinovsky is convinced.    The Yabloko faction definitely declared its refusal to sign  the document at the meeting with the president. The faction's  representative Vyacheslav Shestakovskiy underlined that the  faction had adopted an absolutely definite decision on this  issue.</p>

			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (46): Europe's lost jobs puzzle - Employment / Governments have begun to recognise the economic waste and threat to social stability posed by persistently high levels of unemployment THIS WILL be remembered as the year in which mass unemployment finally rose to the top of the policy agenda in most developed countries. Over the past two decades the underlying jobless total has been rising regardless of the ups and downs of the economic cycle. Every OECD region has seen a trend rise in unemployment rates since 1960. The OECD's latest economic forecast says that, by the end of 1994, the jobless total will have risen to 8.25m in the US and 1.7m in Japan - but 23m in Europe. But only now are governments beginning to recognise the economic waste and threat to social stability that persisting unemployment at these levels implies. At its the June ministerial meeting, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published the interim findings of its investigation into the causes of persistent joblessness in its member countries. The EC has also recognised the seriousness of Europe's unemployment problem, devoting much of the time at its June summit meeting to debating the twin challenges of reducing EC unemployment and reviving jobs growth. Not to be out done, the Clinton administration is organising a summit on world unemployment this autumn. But it is in Europe that the debate appears to have caught the popular and political imagination, not surprisingly perhaps, given the deepening recession that Europe's monetary policy deadlock has bequeathed. The OECD's latest economic forecast says that, by 1994, unemployment rates will have risen to 6.4 per cent in the US, 2.6 per cent in Japan but 12.1 per cent in the EC. Europe also appears to have a more serious medium-term unemployment problem. While the US unemployment rate did move upwards in the 1970s, it has remained throughout the 1980s at around two thirds of European levels. Only 6 per cent of North America's unemployed have been out of work for more than a year, compared with nearly 50 per cent of European job seekers. But it is in the area of employment growth that Europe's record appears most dismal. Since 1970, the US has succeeded in increasing the numbers in employment by 30m - three times as many as the Community. Less than 60 per cent of the EC working age population is currently in employment, compared with around 70 per cent in the US and over 75 per cent in Japan. This employment record touches a sore nerve for European governments. Euro-sclerosis - the belief, popular in the early 1980s, that excessive labour market regulation is undermining Europe's economic performance - is a live issue once more. The OECD, the European Commission and national governments are all now asking whether the low levels of employment, as well as high unemployment, in the EC are the result of the more regulated nature of the European jobs market. Perhaps there is truth in the argument that the combination of persistent unemployment and sluggish job creation in EC countries, relative to other developed countries, indicates a lack of flexibility and competitiveness. The US experience suggests that deregulation has unpleasant distributional side-effects, but the US economy has managed to create a large number of new jobs in the service sector over the past decade. Member countries, a Commission paper suggests, need policies which deliver a more employment-intensive pattern of economic growth. The paper suggests high non-wage labour costs in some continental European countries, employment taxes, inadequate training and rigid working patterns might explain this poor record. Yet, this analysis ignores an important fact: that employment growth in both the US and UK has co-existed with low and falling male employment in both Anglo-Saxon countries. On average over the period 1982-90, and thus excluding the effects of either British recession, 9.7 per cent of British workers were unemployed according to the OECD, higher than in both the US, France and Germany. Rising unemployment is only part of the story. Male labour force participation in the US and UK has dropped sharply over the past two decades as many have shifted from being unemployed to economically inactive. The sum of these two groups is the non-employed. On average in the 1980s, 12 per cent of US males aged 25-54, and 14.9 per cent of UK males in the same age group were out of work compared to 9.1 per cent in France. Neither the US nor UK have avoided the economic shift which has pushed many poorly educated men out of employment: the shift towards more sophisticated technology and the employment of fewer unskilled production workers. By the end of the 1980s, one in five workers in OECD countries was employed in manufacturing, compared with one in four in 1960. Between 1970 and 1987 the share of industrial employment in total employment fell by 7.3 percentage points in the US, by 8.4 points in France and by 14.9 points in the UK. The US and UK have been able substantially to increase total employment by encouraging the creation of relatively low-wage service sector jobs. But these jobs have been shunned by men and taken up mainly by female entrants to the market. The proportion of UK women of working age who have jobs rose by 6.7 percentage points across the 1980s, but male employment fell by 2.6 percentage points. The US and the UK have substantially more women of working age in employment than, for example, France and Germany - nearly 60 per cent on average in the 1980s, compared with less than 50 per cent. But neither the US nor the UK experience suggests that a deregulated, more flexible, labour market is a solution to the puzzle which continues to dog almost all developed country governments: why do so men not work anymore? Labour market deregulation may be the fastest route to higher female employment, albeit at lower wages. But it is not a solution to the OECD's unemployment problem.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A meeting of the deputies of the Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina who have remained in Sarajevo was held today  to discuss just one topic: the latest Geneva negotiations.  Mediha Colo has the details:    [Begin recording] [Colo] At today's meeting of deputies of  the Assembly of Bosnia-Herzegovina who have remained in  Sarajevo, Miro Lazovic, chairman of the Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, informed the deputies about the basic  characteristics of the latest Geneva negotiations.    [Lazovic] [word indistinct] delegation persistently insisted  that the only thing that should be talked about are borders,  and, as he put it, not borders of future republics within the  union, but of independent states, that is, a Serbian state that  would have the right to form links with other independent states  and above all with Serbia. Of course, our delegation kept  refusing this, being of the opinon that one should remain within  [changes thought] that the state of Bosnia-Herzegovina exists  and that one should be talking about the internal setup within  that framework.    It is interesting that even Owen did not persist in keeping  to his plan, but offered our delegation the freedom to present  its new ideas. These new ideas, that is, of Bosnia-Herzegovina  (?with) 17 cantons, as had also been presented at our assembly,  were expounded by Ivo Komsic along with the map that was (?in  the hall) for the first time and that really caused much  attention. It is interesting that Karadzic's delegation agreed  to talk about (?it). On the last day, Owen's proposal to  continue the talks on the Owen-Stoltenberg plan was nevertheless  accepted, taking into account some changed situations and  perhaps some new ideas, but this plan remains as a basis. All  participants in the talks agreed with this and this is the only  truth about the end of the Geneva negotiations.    [Colo] Miro Lazovic also expressed his opinion about the  latest negotiations in Geneva:    [Lazovic] A small move has been made, a move in the sense  that an atmosphere was created that respected these different  opinions without any aggressive statements, above all by  Karadzic's delegation. There has emerged a clear readiness to  reach peace, that is, that it is necessary to stop the war as  soon as possible. One more thing is interesting and that is that  the awareness seems to be gradually prevailing that a global  political solution must be sought that extends beyond  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Karadzic even presented us with an offer,  demanding that we did not get surprised or laugh, to join  Yugoslavia. We rejected this [word indistinct], that is, Haris  Silajdzic resolutely said that we do not want to join a greater  Serbia, but one may speak about Bosnia-Herzegovina as an  independent and sovereign state possibly forming some links and  relations with other states on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia through the European Union or through certain  relations and links for which there is a certain mutual interest.    [Colo] Many deputies present at today's meeting insisted  that our delegation to future negotiations must exclusively  present the policies that have been adopted by the Assembly of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which Assembly Chairman Miro Lazovic finally  also clarified.</p>

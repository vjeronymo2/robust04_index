			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Leading Article: Bhutto revisited MS BENAZIR BHUTTO'S first term as Pakistan's prime minister from 1988 to 1990 was a catalogue of disasters born of her own inexperience and of hostility on the part of the country's political and military establishments. The second chance that began yesterday may therefore not seem a cause for unalloyed rejoicing. There are, however, reasons to suppose that this time could be different, and that Pakistan is not quite the same place that she attempted to rule five years ago. The first is that the Pakistani elite may have learnt something from the turmoil the country has just been through. After a year of wrangling between opposition, government and president, Pakistan this month managed to stage something like a free and fair general election. Although the result was a hung parliament, Ms Bhutto's mandate now seems clear enough, thanks to support from small parties. Her main opponent, Mr Nawaz Sharif, has also promised to respect the result. The army, which with the then president brought Ms Bhutto down last time, now seems prepared to play a more neutral role. And while the danger persists of destabilising constitutional disputes between the government and the president, who is to be elected separately next month, all must now be aware that such battles only lead up a blind alley. Second, Ms Bhutto herself ought this time to be in a stronger position both to diagnose her country's political and economic ills and to treat them, largely thanks to the remarkable interim premiership of her immediate predecessor, Mr Moeen Qureshi. During barely three months in office, Mr Qureshi, spurred on by a foreign exchange crisis, set about tackling the networks of political and financial patronage that lie at the heart of Pakistan's malaise - vowing to tax the country's farmers, for example, and empowering state-owned banks to redeem bad loans they had been forced to make to politicians and powerful businessmen. The economic emergency persists and Ms Bhutto has promised to continue with reforms needed to qualify for a three-year programme of International Monetary Fund loans, as well as to try to end Pakistan's international isolation. None of this will be easy, least of all in a fragile coalition government. But at least Ms Bhutto now knows what she has to do, and has a freer hand than she had before to do it.</p>

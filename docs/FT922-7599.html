			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Two centuries of scams and crashes: As the New York Stock Exchange reaches its 200th birthday, the trading floor remains as noisy as ever. Soon, all that might change 'THE VISITOR finds himself in the vestibule of a vast chamber, which stretches a furlong deep from Broad to New Street. At the farther end . . . is a huge basin-like enclosure, filled with human tumult. Peering down through the high-vaulted, dimly lit space, the eye sees nothing but excited faces, arms flung wildly in the air, heads appearing and disappearing - a billowy mob, from which surges up an incessant and confused clamour.' SINCE James K Medbery penned this portrait of the New York Stock Exchange trading floor more than 120 years ago, the quills and ledgers have been replaced by computer screens and electronic tickers, but the ghost of any trader from those days would find the tumult, confusion and excitable clamour of today's exchange remarkably familiar. The exchange, which celebrates its 200th birthday this weekend, has survived technological revolutions, a mass of regulations, new locations, wars, scandals and crashes, but the people who work the market are the same as ever, and the way stocks are traded in the great citadel of American capitalism remains, superficially at least, chaotic and colourful. Even so, the last great revolution - the introduction of computers - now threatens its very existence. In 200 years the NYSE has moved many times, from a shaded spot under a Buttonwood tree on lower Wall Street, to an upstairs room in a popular downtown coffee house, to the temporary accommodation of various institutions during the 1800s and finally to its present home at 11, Wall Street, where it was transformed by technology. The computers of the 1970s and 1980s brought faster transaction times, improved communication of price and trade data, and a leap in the capacity to handle orders. Unfortunately, the new science carried a cost, most visibly in the vandalising of the elegant lines of George Post's splendid 1903 interiors. More subtly, however, electronic trading threatens the very idea of a single location for a stock exchange. Medbery would be sad to see today's room, with its marble walls and towering windows hidden behind huge brown pipes carrying cables to video screens that loom over trading posts like the legs of giant metal spiders. Computers were only the second great technological revolution to shake up the exchange, however. The first occurred in the mid-19th century, when within a decade or so the telegraph, the telephone and the stock ticker transformed price reporting and financial communications. It was around this time that the 'specialist', the intermediary on the trading floor whose role is to bring buyers and sellers together, emerged. This, however, was not the result of clever invention, but, so the story goes, of a curious accident. In 1875, a broker called James Boyd broke his leg. Although he could no longer move around the trading floor, he was determined to carry on making money. So he set down a chair in the middle of the floor and restricted himself to a single stock, Western Union. Other brokers, knowing that Boyd was stuck in his chair, began to entrust him with the stop and limit orders to buy and sell if prices hit specified levels. This allowed them to go about their business without fear of missing a crucial turn in the market. So successful was Boyd, that other brokers joined him at trading posts fixed to the floor, and the specialists were born. While Boyd and his predecessors as specialists have evolved to become the focal point of trading at today's exchange, it is the speculators who, over two centuries, have probably contributed the most to the development of Wall Street's great money merry-go-round. From Samuel Beebee and his bull pools and bear raids of the early 1800s, to Ivan Boesky and his greedy insiders trading ring of the late 1900s, the brave (and often foolish) gamblers who handle securities like chips in a casino have been inextricably linked to the fortunes of the NYSE. In the earliest years, during the late 18th century, when there was no organised regulation of financial markets, speculators found the perfect outlet for their risk-taking passions in the primitive securities markets that grew up in the tiny streets of downtown Manhattan. One of the first of their breed was William Duer, a speculator whose reckless attempts to corner the market in several big stocks during early 1792 led to the first great US securities crash, and ultimately to the formation of the exchange. Others followed in Duer's footsteps such as the fearless Jacob Little, who earned the sobriquet of 'The Great Bear' such was his fondness for selling stock short. Little's attempt to manipulate the market in Morris Canal &amp; Banking Company shares in 1835 was a classic of its era. Little joined a band of Boston speculators, and bound himself under a penalty of Dollars 25,000 that he would not sell the stock below Dollars 90, and that he would do everything to push the price higher. Little quickly realised that his plan was doomed. He quietly sold his stock to his partners in Boston, who were forced to buy to keep the price up. The Boston speculators lost huge amounts when the stock subsequently crashed, upon which Little calmly sent them his forfeited Dollars 25,000, a trifle in comparison with his winnings. As William Armstrong wrote in 1848, the rage of Little's partners was unbounded, 'and they asserted in a very emphatic manner that if Little ever visited Boston he would inevitably part company with his ears.' Little eventually paid for his mischiefs in 1857 when he went bust owing an extraordinary Dollars 10m after he sold 100,000 Erie Railroad shares short. Sometimes fleecing gullible newcomers to the market was almost too simple. Attracting investors to a new stock issue under false pretences provided some of the easiest pickings. An 1827 newspaper advertisement ran: 'To Capitalists - An Interest in a Valuable Charter for Sale.' The ad promised an income of 8 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent on their stock, coupled with an assurance that 'the whole capital can no doubt be returned in about three years.' No mention was made, however, of what the 'valuable charter' was, nor was there any word of who was behind the issue. Insider trading, so fashionable in the 1980s, was also rife. Speculator-politicians were in a particularly strong position to exploit the market. One such schemer was Senator Kemble of the New York state legislature, who in 1835 pulled off a coup involving the Harlem Railroad Company. After a passionate speech by Kemble in Albany opposing the capital enlargement of the Harlem Railroad, lobbyists for the company returned to New York convinced that any capital enlargement bill would fail. Their confidence spread to the exchange, and sent the price of Harlem sharply higher. Kemble, meanwhile, was in the market, instructing his broker to sell the issue short. Then, he forced a bill through the legislature ensuring the enlargement of Harlem's capital. Not surprisingly, the news sent the stock into a freefall, making Kemble a much richer, man. The crooked Senator got his comeuppance not long after when an investigation into his actions forced him out of the legislature in disgrace. The great speculators who dominated the NYSE's formative years did not all end their careers in ignominy and failure. Few were more renowned for their successes than Cornelius Vanderbilt and Nathan Prime, both multi-millionaires and blazers of various financial trails that Wall Street takes for granted today. Vanderbilt was famous for his ability to influence the entire stock market by his actions. Rumours that he had suffered serious injury in a fall were enough to send the market tumbling 5 per cent. Nathan Prime, meanwhile, was the first of many to earn the label, 'The King of Wall Street'. Prime is generally credited with having been the country's first investment banker. He also speculated in stocks and bonds, owned considerable property interests, and bankrolled shippers and merchants. Unlike the gregarious and sociable Vanderbilt, Prime could not enjoy life outside his work. Walter Barret, writing in 1864, described Prime's sad demise after his retirement: 'All seemed fair in the future for old Mr Prime. Vast wealth, excellent sons, daughters all well married, he had nothing else to do but live and enjoy himself. Did he do so? No. The strange fancy seized upon his mind that he was becoming poor - that his destiny was to die in the almshouse. Under this singular monomania, and hallucination of mind, he cut his throat with a razor and died in an instant.' The suicides of powerful speculators became synonymous with the NYSE much later on, during the great crash of 1929 when newspapers published breathless reports of penniless financiers leaping from skyscrapers. The market's decline was so dramatic and the bankruptcies so widespread during the 1929 crash that it was widely reported that clerks in downtown hotels were asking guests whether they wanted a room for sleeping or jumping. There were no mass suicides 58 years later when the NYSE faced a second great crisis, the crash of October 1987. Yet the shock at the collapse of that bull market seemed just as great to those who lived through it. Art Cashin, a broker with almost 30 years experience on the floor at the NYSE, remembers the 1987 crash as an almost surreal experience. 'After the Dow was down over 200 points (on Black Monday), people had that look you see when movies go into slow-motion. People were functioning, but they weren't relating to what was going on around them.' Although specialists, brokers and investors were hit hard in 1987, the exchange's system itself stood the test. The computer technology introduced in the 1970s coped with the huge orders during the worst of the panic. The technology, however, did leave some scars. Computerised program trading (programs automatically buy or sell at pre-set prices) of large bundles of stock was widely blamed for exacerbating price volatility during the panic. The case against progam trading was never convincingly proven, but the controversy was enough to persuade the NYSE to introduce 'circuit breakers' that limit the use of programs during volatile days. Ironically, while technological change has produced enormous benefits, it is now threatening the exchange's most famous asset - the trading floor. Rival electronic markets that allow trading via computer screens have been picking up business from the NYSE and are growing in popularity among investors. As exchanges throughout the world move the physical trading of securities from giant rooms to a chain of decentralised offices linked by computer, the likelihood has increased that the exchange's great floor, with the human tumult and confused clamour that so enchanted Medbery, will (as it has in London) one day be silenced.</p>

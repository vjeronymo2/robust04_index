			<p><P> October 31, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOUNDATION FOR DISABLED RECEIVES $1-MILLION GRANT  </P> <P> The Vista Hill Foundation has received a $1-million grant from a retired  frozen-food entrepreneur to modernize its Vista Los Ninos Education Center.  </P> <P> Sam and Rose Stein of Poway will be honored by the foundation in January when  it renames the center in the Steins' honor. The center will receive $500,000  for renovations and a $500,000 endowment for operating expenses.  </P> <P> Last year, nearly 200 disabled clients received one-on-one care in the  deteriorating converted Grantville Elementary School on Decena Drive, which the  center has called home for four years.  </P> <P> The center, which began 19 years ago teaching 10 autistic preschoolers at St.  Luke's Episcopal Church in North Park, cares for children and adults with  developmental disabilities, including cerebral palsy, epilepsy and mental  retardation.  </P> <P> The center will use the million-dollar grant, the largest in its history, for  remodeling and other improvements, said Liz McInnis, the center's executive  director.  </P> <P> The private center, whose $3-million annual budget is mostly  government-subsidized, allows disabled children and adults to remain in the  community and out of state institutions.  </P> <P> "The children at the center cannot be served in the public school system," said  Marsha Alex Lubick, director of community affairs for the Vista Hill  Foundation. "They are multiply handicapped children. Our goal is to reintegrate  them back into the public schools' special-education programs if it is  possible."  </P> <P> "We place five to six children a year, and for us that's a success story,"  McInnis said. "Because we are here, we are keeping children out of state  institutions and help keep these kids in the community."  </P> <P> With a staff of 130 consulting psychiatrists, occupational therapists,  psychologists and teachers, the center boasts a teacher-student ratio of 1 to 1  for most of its special education, after-school recreation and adult day-care  programs, McInnis said.  </P> <P> The adult program, launched in 1980 with about six clients, grew out of a need  to "serve disabled adults who needed more supervision than traditional programs  were able to provide," she said.  </P> <P> Today the adult program teaches more than 90 clients, ages 18 to 64, how to  handle leisure time and basic living skills.  </P></p>

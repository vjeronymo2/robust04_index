The goal of case plan implementation is to assist people to become self-sufficient, preventing dependency, strengthening family relationships, and restoring individuals, families or groups to successful social functioning. When an ineligible adult is a member of an assistance household, the case plan shall address the spousal, parental and/or custodial responsibilities of the ineligible person relative to the financial support of the eligible members of the household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Further, it is BIA policy to ensure, insofar as possible, that Indians have full access to available Federal and state services.

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Observer: History lesson It's over three weeks since Jacques Attali's European Bank for Reconstruction and Development opened for business. But it still cannot function properly until the US, the biggest shareholder, makes two key appointments. One is a vice-president for merchant banking able to work under the visionary Attali. The other is a director who can keep the Frenchman in check. Both must be Americans. While most of the interest has centred on the merchant banking job, the choice of the executive director could well turn out to be even more important. For the moment, the job's being done by Emily Walker of the US Treasury. It has not gone unnoticed by students of international financial relations that the first president of the World Bank - EBRD's grand-daddy - fell out with the US executive director. And both were Americans. Eugene Meyer, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve and owner of the Washington Post, seemed an ideal candidate to be the first World Bank president. He had run his own Wall Street firm and done various public jobs for seven American presidents. But he quickly clashed with Emilio Collado, a headstrong US director, and Meyer's unwillingness to engage in bureaucratic infighting led to his sudden departure six months after he took the job. Forty years on, America's delay in filling the EBRD posts suggests that the same sort of tensions are not far below the surface.</p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: European aluminium import record forecast Primary aluminium consumption in Europe, which ranks with north America as the biggest market for the metal, is rebounding strongly this year but production continues to fall. So there will be record imports in 1994, the European Aluminium Association suggested yesterday. Consumption is forecast to rise by 7.5 per cent to 4.84m tonnes, recovering from a 7.5 per cent fall in 1993 to 4.53m tonnes, according to the association. Production, after dropping by 2.4 per cent to 3.27m tonnes in 1993, is expected to be another 4 per cent down at under 3.13m tonnes. Mr Fokko van Duyne, chairman of the association, painted an optimistic picture for aluminium consumption in Europe, which already accounts for 27 per cent of the western world total. He suggested that it would rise by between 2.5 and 3 per cent a year to reach nearly 6m tonnes by the year 2000. With consumption of secondary (scrap) metal rising faster - by an annual 5 per cent - total aluminium requirements in Europe by then would be about 8m tonnes. That suggested that in the next five years Europe's primary aluminium imports would jump by nearly 1m tonnes from 1.7m tonnes this year. Production was not likely to go any lower, Mr van Duyne said, because there was enough competitively priced energy available to support Europe's remaining capacity. He said the automotive industry offered the most impressive potential growth area for worldwide aluminium consumption. 'Cautious estimates' suggested aluminium use would grow from an average of 65kg a car to 115kg by 2000. That would absorb an extra 2m tonnes. 'As more than 30 per cent of the world's car production is concentrated in Europe there is an enormous potential for aluminium here,' he pointed out. However Mr van Duyne warned that European Union national social-economic and environmental policy could endanger aluminium growth prospects. He was particularly concerned about 'ecological taxes' such as the European CO-energy tax or a national 'ecotax' as implemented in Belgium. 'This is a very dangerous development. It will decrease consumer spending power without providing other benefits except for raising the tax income of governments.' Mr Dick Dermer, the association president said exports of Russian aluminium to the rest of the world were expected to rise again from 1.7m tonnes in 1993 to 2m tonnes this year. However, western world primary aluminium consumption was forecast to rise by between 7.5m and 16.7m tonnes this year. World supply and demand was making 'the first moves towards a more balanced situation'.</p>

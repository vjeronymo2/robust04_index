			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS DROP BRONCOS INTO LAST PLACE;  </P> <P> AFC: SAN DIEGO, LIMITING DENVER'S OFFENSE TO 211 YARDS, GETS ITS THIRD VICTORY  IN A ROW.  </P> <P> The San Diego Chargers, a team on the upswing, defeated the Denver Broncos, a  team on the downswing, 19-7, Sunday.  </P> <P> The Chargers have now won three consecutive games and four out of five. The  Chargers hadn't won three in a row since the strike year of 1987.  </P> <P> Excluding the strike season, not since 1985 have the Chargers been .500 this  late in the season. Go back to 1982, and that's the last time the Chargers were  in the playoffs.  </P> <P> But things are turning upside down in the AFC West. The Broncos (3-6) are left  for playoff dead, while the Chargers (5-5) are in third place, behind the  Raiders (6-3) and Chiefs (5-4), who both lost Sunday.  </P> <P> The Broncos, who were in the Super Bowl last season, are now in last place.  </P> <P> "They might be playing as well as anyone right now," Denver Coach Dan Reeves  said.  </P> <P> The Chargers went after Sunday's win in playoff fashion. They combined a potent  running game with a defiant defense and stymied Denver's attempts to rally.  </P> <P> Running back Marion Butts, who entered the game as the NFL's leading rusher,  wasn't supposed to play. He had a deep thigh bruise and the club considered  keeping him out of uniform.  </P> <P> The Chargers kept Rod Bernstine (hamstring) in civilian clothes, and started  Ronnie Harmon. Harmon ran 10 times for 71 yards, and then came Butts.  </P> <P> He ran 16 times for 114 yards, including a 45-yard run that set up a field goal  that left the Broncos stunned.  </P> <P> "Sitting out the first quarter made me hungry," Butts said.  </P> <P> The Chargers' defense, meanwhile, was cracking down on the Broncos. They  limited the Broncos to 211 yards in total offense, sacked John Elway three  times, and intercepted two of his passes.  </P> <P> "That's a good football team," said Elway, who was coming off a toe injury and  also had a strained arch.  </P> <P> "The toe's numb, but it's the knife here," he said, while pointing to the  middle of his chest, "that needs to come out."  </P> <P> The Chargers used four field goals from John Carney to build a 12-7 lead with  3:11 to play in the third quarter, but then Denver put them to the test.  </P> <P> On the ensuing kickoff following Carney's fourth field goal, Kevin Clark ran 75  yards to the Chargers' 25-yard line. It was the longest return in Denver  history since 1972, and it put the Broncos in position to push ahead.  </P> <P> But the Chargers' defense refused to budge, and on third and seven Elway  surrendered to Burt Grossman's relentless pass rush. As Grossman leaped into  the air, Elway tried to force a pass to wide receiver Michael Young in the end  zone.  </P> <P> Cornerback Gill Byrd, however, was there for the interception. It was Byrd's  second of the day, and for the team's all-time leader in interceptions with 32,  his seventh of the season.  </P> <P> "It was a stupid play on my part," Elway said.  </P> <P> Byrd's interception gave the Chargers possession at their own 20, and they went  on an 80-yard march and scored on linebacker Gary Plummer's one-yard dive.  Plummer, who lines up as blocking back in goal-line situations, has now scored  twice for the Chargers this season.  </P> <P> Carney's extra point gave the Chargers a 19-7 advantage, but the Broncos were  not finished.  </P> <P> After getting the ball on their own 12, they moved to the Chargers' one-yard  line with a first and goal.  </P> <P> But on first down, Bobby Humphrey was tackled for a two-yard loss, and on  second down, tight end Chris Verhulst bobbled a pass from Elway as he went out  of the end zone, thereby negating atouchdown. On third down, defensive tackle  Lee Williams sacked Elway for a nine-yard loss, and on fourth and goal from the  11, safety Vencie Glenn knocked down Elway's pass in the end zone.  </P></p>

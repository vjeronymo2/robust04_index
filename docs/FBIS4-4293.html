			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Wang Juntao Speaks on China's </F> Changing Situation"]    [Text] Noted Chinese dissident Wang Juntao, who is in the  United States, finally disregarded wife Hou Xiaotian's  exhortations and no longer responded to reporters' questions  with the two words: "Thank you."    After staying in jail for five years to complete the  "required course" for his being a "professional politician,"  Wang Juntao still kept his candid, self-confident style. A few  days ago, he told reporters: "I, Wang Juntao, never evade any  questions."    Wang Juntao was quoted in Taiwan's CHINA TIMES and UNITED  DAILY as saying that after going into jail, he once was  handcuffed and placed in confinement for protesting against the  authorities' decision to stop letting him met his wife, but  apart from that, he was treated well by the prison authorities  most of the time. It has been learned that the Ministry of  Justice -- the highest administrative unit of prisons in the  mainland -- had given clear instructions: "Anyone (warders) who  harasses Wang Juntao will be punished."    However, Wang Juntao said that he did not enjoy preferential  treatment right from the beginning, but that his conditions  improved every year. After being arrested in Changsha, Hunan,  in 1989, he was locked up in Wuhan Public Security Bureau's  detention center, then transferred immediately to that noted  concentration center for political prisoners -- Beijing's  Qincheng Prison. In 1991, he was condemned to 13 years'  imprisonment and served his sentence in Beijing's No. 2 Prison  and in Yanqing Prison. In his first year of prison life, he was  locked up in a stinking, messy prison cell. In the second year,  he contracted hepatitis-B and was sent to hospital for  treatment, but he was still undernourished. In the third year,  newspapers and periodicals were available, and a TV set and a  Hi-Fi system were set up in his prison cell. Moreover, there  was a refrigerator and he could eat anything he liked. To his  surprise, he was sent to the No. 301 Hospital -- the best  military hospital -- and received specialist treatment when he  fell ill.    Wang Juntao claimed that he and the warders got along quite  well and that they called each other "brothers" in private.  When he left the prison, a warder asked him: "Will you bear a  grudge against me?" Wang patted the warder's arm and said: "I  understand your plight. In the future, I will treat you  leniently."    Wang Juntao smiled: "I am not grateful to the CPC simply  because of my enjoying preferential treatment. I would not  accept the charges against me, even if I were locked up in  Zhongnanhai because it was absolutely unjustifiable and illegal  to sentence me to 13 years' imprisonment. I was deprived of my  freedom illegally, I must defend my political integrity, and I  must appear stronger than they.... So it was not that they  reprimanded me, but that they educated us in the prison" [suo yi  zai jian yu li bu shi ta men xun chi wo er shi jiao yu wo men  2076 0110 0961 4148 3739 5937 0008 2508 0100 0226 6064 2444 2053  5079 2508 2403 5148 2053 0226]."    As people inside and outside the mainland were particularly  concerned about the cases of Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, and  because Hou Xiaotian made unremitting appeals to the  international community on her husband's behalf, the Chinese  authorities were forced to consider Wang's release, even if he  did not suffer any physical torture in the prison. In last  November, when the APEC summit was held in Seattle, U.S.  President Clinton brought up Wang Juntao's case in the presence  of CPC General Secretary Jiang Zemin. This year, in order to get  the United States to extend its MFN treatment, China took  quicker steps to release Wang Juntao. A month ago, Hou Xiaotian  was informed of her husband's forthcoming release, while Wang  Juntao also was notified of this news in prison.    On 18 April, a deputy director of the Administration of  Reform Through Labor of the Chinese Ministry of Justice came to  Wang Juntao's medical ward and said to him: "To respond to the  U.S. Government's request, we have consented to let you go to  the United States for medical treatment."    Wang Juntao was extremely grieved and tears started from his  eyes, as a Chinese citizen being treated inhumanely cannot  ameliorate his fate until foreigners step in, and he even had to  go abroad to cure his illness! He asked in reply: "What if I  do not agree?" The deputy director said: "You may disagree,  but then you must remain here."    Finally, Wang Juntao compromised with the authorities. He  told reporters: "I could not lose this opportunity. I married  Xiaotian in 1986, but we have been separated from each other for  five out of the past seven years; she pays a too high price for  us. However, I stated clearly to the deputy director of the  Administration of Reform Through Labor that my consent to go to  the United States did not imply that I confessed myself guilty.  The deputy director said: `You have not reformed yourself  well.'"    Soon afterward, the official politely said that the  authorities placed three hopes on him, stressing that "this is  not a request":    1. Devote your energies to receiving medical treatment.    2. Pay attention to your health, and do not carry out any  activities unrelated to this.    3. Remember that you are a Chinese, and do not do anything  to  harm your motherland's interests.    Wang Juntao immediately said that it was necessary to  clarify  the meaning of "motherland" since the "motherland" should not  represent the interests of only a few.    The authorities concerned hinted that if Wang Juntao  "behaved  well" outside the country, this would contribute to the release  of other dissidents. Hence, on the day when he arrived at New  York's Kennedy International Airport, Wang Juntao said he felt  "vexed" at himself. He was worried that his friends in prison,  including Chen Ziming and Liu Gang, would be implicated, so he  could not speak out freely.    It was precisely such a "not well-reformed prisoner" who  was sent, with many officials crowding around, to Beijing  International Airport on the morning of 22 April. At the  airport, officials shook hands with him and extended their  congratulations one after another. Moreover, "humane"  arrangements were made to allow his father, a lieutenant  general, and his relatives in Beijing to bid him farewell in the  airport's VIP lounge. At that time, his mother's face was  "bathed in tears."    Before leaving Beijing, an official of the U.S. Embassy in  China had a brief conversation with Wang and asked him two  questions. The first was: "Do you volunteer to go?" Wang  answered: "Yes, I do." The second one was: "After all, how is  your health?" Wang answered: "In China, a patient is not  informed of his real health condition, only his family members  or his unit know."    It was precisely in this way that on the same day, Wang  Juntao, accompanied by the first secretary of the U.S. Embassy,  took a United Airlines flight to the United States and sat in  the first-class cabin. He held a "PRC passport" and filled in  the occupation column with the word "unemployed"; the passport  will expire after April 1999.    Wang Juntao is still as self-confident as he was before  going  to jail. He said: "In the plane, I dozed off three times and  passed my five years of prison life to my memory. I have  already adapted myself to my new life."    Wang Juntao said he did not think that the upsurge of doing  business in Mainland China had already stifled the people's  grievances against the current regime; on the contrary, it can  be said that a latent crisis is present everywhere which may  break out at any time, no matter whether Deng Xiaoping is dead  or not.    In his view, China's future situation is subject to all  kinds  of changes, including an out-of-control situation of massive  collapse and chaos. Once there is massive chaos, the  consequences will be dreadful to contemplate, and no one knows  how many people will die. In this way, the goal of democracy may  finally be fulfilled, but it certainly will be achieved at the  expense of innumerable deaths. Therefore, such a path must be  averted at any cost.    Wang Juntao said that when the intelligentsia debated the  idea of "new authoritarianism" prior to the 4 June Incident, he  had tried his best to evade such a debate. He even did not want  to make any explanation when someone described him as the one  who believed in "new authoritarianism." He was not eager to  take part in ideological debates because he was soberly aware  that the best way to deliver China from the crisis was to put  forward a concrete proposal and to devise tactics to make it  work. In the past, he and his comrades had done so, and in the  future, they would do the same.    He has many old friends in overseas democratic  organizations,  and he said he would meet them. If someone really proposes to  him to do something, he wants to do something inside China, but  not outside. He said: "For those who are engaged in China's  politics, there is too little room for maneuver outside the  country. Therefore, I will return to China once I am healed."    He repeatedly stressed that his greatest concern at present  is his friend Chen Ziming, who also was sentenced to 13 years'  imprisonment and who remains in prison. He will try his best to  strive to win the earliest possible restoration of Chen's  freedom, and he hoped that people inside and outside China would  continue to show their solicitude for Chen.</p>

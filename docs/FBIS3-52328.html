During the news conference, the two sides spoke about  the issues they discussed during their meetings and the results  of the Qatari minister's talks in Amman. Details are in the  following report:    At the outset of the news conference, Talal Sat'an al-Hasan,  the minister of state for foreign affairs, welcomed the Qatari  minister, stressing the similarity in the viewpoints of the two  fraternal countries on various issues discussed during the  visit. The Qatari foreign minister thanked His Majesty King  Husayn and His Highness Crown Prince Hasan for the warm  reception he received during his visit. He said:    "I would like to express my deep thanks to His Majesty King  Husayn and his highness the crown prince for the warm reception  my accompanying delegation and I have received. Moreover, I  thank his majesty for the medal he has awarded me. This is a  great honor for me and for the brothers accompanying me during  this visit.    "As for the nature of the talks, of course, there were  special talks between Qatar and Jordan and there were special  talks about Arab cooperation and reunification. Moreover, there  were talks that dealt with some international issues, especially  the peace process and what is taking place on this course. We  discussed these issues with total frankness and a logic that  should prevail in our inter-Arab relations.    "Of course, I conveyed a message from his highness the Amir  [of Qatar] and received a reply from His Majesty King Husayn  that falls within the context of the cooperation and ancient  brotherly relations between the two.    "The current higher joint committee will organize all the  actions to be taken with respect to previous agreements. There  is no reason why a visit by Qatar's heir apparent to Jordan  should not take place in return for His Highness Crown Prince  Hasan's visit. We are with Jordan whether his highness the  crown prince visits Qatar or the Qatari heir apparent visits  Jordan, as it is his second country."    Asked about the role that Qatar could play to clear the  Arab atmosphere, the Qatari foreign minister said:    "In fact, the relations should be clear from the beginning  and all Arab countries should be frank with each other, not in  order to defame one another but to overcome any crisis and  misunderstanding and to surpass difficulties and the crises the  Arab world faced recently.    "There is no doubt that Qatar is a small country. However,  we hope that we will play a role that is not aimed at achieving  any kind of victory but at clearing the Arab atmosphere. This  is because we, the people and government of Qatar, believe that  there can be no victory for the Arabs except through their  unity. If we wanted to look back on the past, we would recall  that Arab unanimity during the 1973 war was achieved because of  frank Arab solidarity. All our victories were achieved through  our solidarity, while all our problems and tragedies have been  due to division and to the method of dealing which, we believe,  should not prevail among Arab countries."    Asked about Jordanian-Qatari relations, in general, the  Qatari foreign minister said:    "These relations, as I said earlier, are ancient relations.  Our relations with Jordan were not affected at any time. There  is no doubt that a misunderstanding took place during the recent  Gulf crisis and the occupation of Kuwait. We believe that we  should overcome this misunderstanding despite how it took place.  This misunderstanding should be overcome and taken as a lesson  for our future as an Arab nation. We should stand alongside  right under any circumstances. This is what Qatar is hoping  for."    For his part, Talal al-Hasan, the minister of state for  foreign affairs, summed up the results of the visit by saying:    "At the end of this positive visit, which I hope will be  repeated and will lead to more visits between the two countries,  I would like to say that it was a successful and fruitful one.  During this visit, we reached constructive agreements which,  without a doubt, will have a positive reflection on relations  between the two countries and will yield good results that will  push the course of bilateral relations forward. I can very  clearly tell you that understanding was very evident during all  our meetings and that the identity in views was tangible in all  the meetings that were held during this visit by his excellency  the minister and his accompanying delegation.    "This visit gains its uniqueness not only from the fact that  it comes at this particular time, but also from the nature of  the issues that were discussed during this visit and the great  similarity in the views the two countries' leaderships hold on  these issues. This is in addition to the two leadership's joint  understanding of the need for serious and continuous action to  correct the Arab situation in order to maintain Arab rights and  protect this nation's higher joint interests.    "It was natural for us to take this opportunity to discuss  the various circumstances that face our nation, including Arab  relations, the peace process, and the changes which regional and  international developments impose on all of us.    "Bilateral relations occupied an important part of our talks  as we proceeded from a determination by His Majesty King Husayn  and brother His Highness Shaykh Khalifah Bin-Hamad Al Thani, the  amir of Qatar, to strengthen these relations and develop them in  various fields until they reach the required level of strength  and firmness. This determination was expressed during His  Highness Crown Prince Hasan's visit to Doha last August and  during this visit.    "I am pleased to note that we reached an agreement on a  practical formula that represents a mechanism to follow up the  growth and development of bilateral relations in various fields  by forming a joint committee at the foreign ministerial level.  This joint committee will meet periodically in the capitals of  both countries for this purpose. The committee's first meeting  will be held during the first quarter of this year in Doha, God  willing.    "Moreover, we reviewed in detail the various agreements that  organize bilateral relations."</p>

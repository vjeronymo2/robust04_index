			<p>920921 FT  21 SEP 92 / Observer: Birthday Party Shin Kanemaru, the 'godfather and kingmaker' of Japanese politics, has just celebrated his 78th birthday quietly at home - in place of the annual party whose guest list is generally a good guide to future prime ministers. He shared the occasion with a few generals from his faction, the largest in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, but had no guests from the Tokyo Prosecutors' office, which is seeking an audience with him over a generous and possibly illegal Y500m donation from a parcel delivery company, Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. Each day for the past two weeks, the big question has been whether Kanemaru will keep his appointment with the prosecutors or whether they will make a house-call, since the godfather, who has a Brando-like mumble, has confined himself to quarters. This strange stand-off does not surprise ordinary Japanese, who appreciate that the prosecutors want to question Kanemaru but not to humiliate him. They have, however, rejected a suggestion from the great man that he write them a note explaining his behaviour and that bygones then be bygones. While old and privileged friends suggest that he has spent most of his time playing mah-jong, the Chinese game of chance, Kanemaru's long stay at home has already had international consequences. Ichiro Ozawa, generally described in the Japanese press as Kanemaru's 'loyal deputy', last week cancelled a get-to-know-you trip to the US and Europe. Ozawa, generally seen as close to a turn at the prime ministership, said he couldn't leave until Kanemaru and the prosecutors had settled their differences.</p>

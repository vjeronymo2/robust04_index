			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETING: AD FIRMS HEAD TO THE BEACH TO FIND A MORE CREATIVE LIFESTYLE  </P> <P> Any time Chuck Kushell is so inclined, he can peer down from his office and see  if his home is floating away.  </P> <P> Kushell's home happens to be a 64-foot powerboat docked in Marina del Rey. His  office, which has a bird's-eye view of the boat, is the West Coast branch of  the ad agency Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos. After the firm decided to  open office space here, primarily to create ads for Infiniti, Kushell felt  plenty of pressure to rent office space on Wilshire Boulevard, where more than  two dozen other Los Angeles ad agencies are located. Instead, he chose Marina  del Rey.  </P> <P> "There used to be a security blanket involved with a Wilshire Boulevard  address," said Kushell. "There isn't anymore."  </P> <P> Just as agencies began fleeing Madison Avenue several years ago for the West  Side of Manhattan, a similar movement away from the Mid-Wilshire District and  Century City is taking place in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> But there appears to be one key difference. In New York, it was primarily  escalating rents that caused the mass migration. But most top Los Angeles  agency executives whose offices have -- or are about to have -- addresses in  Santa Monica, Venice and Marina del Rey say it wasn't better prices that lured  them. It was the promise of better lifestyles in the beach towns.  </P> <P> "There is a psychic value," said Gerrold Rubin, chairman of Rubin Postaer &amp;  Associates, which will be moving next year from Century City to Santa Monica,  just two blocks from the ocean. "There is a certain environment close to the  ocean that we think attracts good people. It also breeds a creative  atmosphere."  </P> <P> Besides Rubin Postaer, with its 160 employees, two other Los Angeles agencies  plan to move from Century City to Santa Monica. Kresser/Craig, which creates  ads for Arco, will be moving in September. And Poindexter/Osaki/Nissman, which  creates ads for the Los Angeles Zoo, also expects to move there soon.  </P> <P> "Let's face it," said Robert Kresser, chairman of Kresser/Craig, "the  environment's a lot more conducive to creativity in Santa Monica then it is in  Century City."  </P> <P> Adds Larry Poindexter, president of Poindexter/Osaki/Nissman, "Not only is it a  more attractive place for employees to work, but you don't need armed guards to  escort them to their cars at night."  </P> <P> Several agencies already call Santa Monica home. Suissa &amp; Associates, which  creates ads for the Sports Connection, has been there since opening in 1985.  And the Shalek Agency, which places ads for Fox Broadcasting Co., opened there  in 1988. Chiat/Day/Mojo, which moved to Venice in 1988, is in the process of  building a $20-million-plus headquarters there which is expected to be  completed next year.  </P> <P> Indeed, many agency executives say that after Chiat/Day/Mojo made its move, the  door was opened for others. "Certainly Chiat/Day broke the ice," said  Poindexter. "They made it legitimate."  </P> <P> Several of Chiat/Day/Mojo's top executives live in Marina del Rey. And a number  of its employees live on the Westside. "Above everything else, we knew it would  make it easier for people to get to work," said Bob Wolf, chairman of  Chiat/Day/Mojo North America, which creates ads for Nissan. Added Wolf, "What's  creative about being in a Mid-Wilshire high-rise?"  </P> <P> For David Suissa, there was never a question about where to locate his agency  five years ago. "Why have an agency in Los Angeles if the surroundings look  like New York City?" posed the agency chairman, who lives in Venice, just  minutes from his agency.  </P> <P> "I came here to be away from everyone else," said Nancy Shalek, president of  the Shalek Agency, which throws an agency bash on the beach every year. "We  didn't want to be in a building where a typographer can stop once and make 12  pickups" of ad copy from different agencies.  </P> <P> But not everyone is sold on being so close to the beach to feel the breeze.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles office of J. Walter Thompson moved west from Century City this  week to a new address on Wilshire Boulevard that is closer to the beach -- if  you consider 40 blocks close.  </P> <P> While agency executives did consider property in Santa Monica, James K. Agnew,  the agency's general manager, decided against it. "It seemed to us that it  could be interpreted by some people as too Southern California -- or too  flaky."  </P> <P> Not about to move to Santa Monica any time soon is the Western Division of Grey  Advertising, says Miles J. Turpin, agency chairman. Turpin says he's happy with  his agency's Mid-Wilshire location. A move further west would put the agency  too far away from its clients, and also too far from many key suppliers.  </P> <P> The pull of the ocean tide is hardly pulling Turpin. "I don't know if someone  is more creative," he said, "because they can go down at noon and stick their  toe in the Pacific."  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Many Themes of Luxury Car Ads  </P> <P> What is the "hot button" for luxury car buyers?  </P> <P> That's what every luxury car manufacturer -- from Germany to Japan to England  to America -- would like to know. And a recent study of several dozen ads for  11 different luxury car makers by the Los Angeles advertising research firm  Phase One concludes that manufacturers from each nation are trying different ad  themes.  </P> <P> "German manufacturers believe we want practical reasons for buying a luxury  car," said Jim Hillson, vice president and senior analyst at Phase One.  "Japanese car makers generally portray their cars as being state-of-the-art  machines."  </P> <P> As for the British, "they're relying mainly on the tradition of British  luxuriousness and prestige," said Hillson. And America's top-selling luxury  cars, Cadillac and Lincoln Town Car, present "time-honored images of size and  power."  </P> <P> So, who's selling the most luxury cars in the United States? Surprise: it's  Cadillac and Lincoln. The two car lines accounted for 56% of the luxury cars  sold in the United States from October, 1989, through February, 1990, reports  Ward's Automotive Reports.  </P> <P> Still, as both competition and prices increase, Hillson says more luxury car  makers will create ads to persuade consumers that luxury cars "are a  value-driven, rather than an ego-driven, purchase."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rewriting the Rules for Paying Agencies  </P> <P> Tough financial times are forcing ad agencies to not only be more creative with  their ads, but also be more creative in developing ways for clients to pay  them.  </P> <P> This week, DDB Needham Worldwide is expected to announce a new compensation  system that will vastly change the conventional 15% system used historically --  but not always practically -- in the industry. Under the plan to be announced  Wednesday, the agency is expected to tie compensation to the market performance  of its clients' products. Some smaller agencies have already taken this tack,  but DDB Needham would be the largest agency to formally adopt the strategy.  </P> <P> It is believed the agency will seek a top dollar rate -- up to 20% commission  -- for brands that exceed sales expectations. But it would also agree to accept  lower rates -- from 10% to 0% -- for brands that fail to perform.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Former Ad Duo Goes Hollywood  </P> <P> Many people who create advertisements dream about getting out of the ad  business someday to write megabuck screenplays.  </P> <P> That dream became a reality last month for two Los Angeles ad men who sold  their screenplay for a reported $750,000 to Morgan Creek Productions, which  produced the films "Major League" and "Enemies, A Love Story." The screenplay,  "Stay Tuned," is about a depressed television addict who makes a pact with the  devil and is pulled into his TV set -- -- unable to escape from the frightening  TV dimension.  </P> <P> It was written during a nine-month period -- over weekends and during their  free time -- by Jim Jennewein, former associate creative director at the Los  Angeles agency Speer, Young &amp; Hollander, and Tom Parker, a former  copywriter at Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. They also had creative consulting  assistance from Rich Seigel, who is a copywriter at the agency Bozell.  </P> <P> Both Jennewein and Parker -- who last year produced the Adweek parody magazine  Madweek -- have already left their agency jobs to pursue film writing careers.  "In advertising, it's hard to be creative because of all the restrictions that  clients place on you," said Jennewein, who is 34. "We feel emancipated."  </P></p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Alliance Canadian rights cancelled Alliance Resources, the oil and gas exploration and production concern, said that as a result of receiving incorrect legal advice in Canada, its rights issue there did not comply with local security laws. Accordingly, the company had decided to cancel the offer in Canada and return monies received. Last month, the company announced that the 10.97m new ordinary shares not taken up in the issue had been sold by Durlacher &amp; Co. Acceptances were received in Canada in respect of 1.86m rights shares. However, those holders whose shares are registered in Canada - including many UK institutions - are to be allowed to subscribe at the original issue price of 5p per share for the number of shares for which they accepted in Canada.</p>

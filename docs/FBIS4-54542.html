			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by mak.: "Favorable Signals"] </F>   [Text] Early this year, the indicators of industrial  output, labor productivity, and exports have been favorable.  Such is the conclusion from the findings of polls conducted by  CUP [Central Planning Office] at 133 industrial, construction,  and commercial enterprises, both public and private, and at 39  bank branches. To be sure, this cannot be the basis for  evaluating the entire economy, but it may be that general trends  are similar.    Since December, the proportion of enterprises at which  output  has been rising remained the same at 30 percent. A most  important fact is the 9-percent decline in February, compared  with January, in the number of enterprises at which output fell.  The rapid decline in unemployment has been halted. The decline  in exports has been halted after three months of a steady  decrease. More than one-half of the enterprises reported that  the demand for their products is close to their productive  capacities. The respondents to CUP's polls also expected the  favorable trends to persist in March.    At more than 70 percent of the polled enterprises, average  wage did not change, while at 30 percent (that is, fewer,  compared with 35 percent in December) the "popiwek" [tax on wage  increases] was paid. In February, 26 percent of the enterprises  (compared with 26 percent in January and 21 percent in December)  raised the prices of their products and services. Fewer than 1  percent of the enterprises reported price reductions. Prices are  rising because of the rising costs of raw materials, energy, and  producer goods.  <H5>  In Industry </H5>   In February, output rose at 30 percent of the polled  enterprises and declined at 31 percent. These proportions are  better than in the previous months and, most importantly, the  forecasts for March are favorable. Forty-one percent of the  enterprises anticipate an increase in output, and only 4 percent  expect a decrease. Despite these improved prospects, it was  pointed out that reasons for restricting output remain numerous.  At many plants, the output level is unstable, and output  planning is for periods not longer than six months.    However, numerous instances prove that enterprises are  exploring ways of extricating themselves from their problems.  Marketing, the application of new technologies, restructuring,  and organizational changes generally produce favorable results.  It would be worthwhile to consider these instances.    The Amino Plant in Poznan is part of the U.S. concern CPC  operating 116 plants in 52 countries. Following modernization  and the introduction of new licenses, the products of the Polish  factory successfully withstand competition with Western  products. The Automotive Electronics Plant in Elk (branch of the  Warsaw FSO Passenger Car Factory) exports one-half of its  output. It manufactures wiring (electrical, brake cable, etc.)  for various makes of cars, such as Mercedes-Benz, GM, Fiat, and  Peugeot. The Herbapol Plant in Lublin is benefiting from the  growing interest in herbs, syrups, herb medicines, and herb  teas. A new shift was added, along with 40 new jobs, and  employment rose to 500.    But, as the questionnaires show, the situation is not as  favorable everywhere. Many enterprises and even entire branches  and subsectors face huge problems with maintaining production.  This chiefly concerns the arms plants. Their workforces are  demanding bigger orders from the Defense Ministry, funds for  restructuring, a halt to the placement of orders with foreign  suppliers for those armament components that can be produced in  this country, and social protection. The dispute betwee the  Defense Ministry and the Mielec Transportation Equipment Plant  about the Iryda aircraft threatens a decline of the aviation  industry.    The situation of the entire shipyard industry is  deteriorating. The cutbacks in production at Gdansk Shipyard  Incorporated directly affect its principal engine  suppliers--that is, the Cegielski Plant in Poznan and Zgoda in  Swietochlowice. It is believed that, although the crisis of the  shipping industry worldwide is passing, the expensive products  of the debt-laden Polish shipyards are not likely to find buyers.  <H5>  In Foreign Trade </H5>   Following three months of steady decline, in February the  proportion of enterprises whose exports increased rose (from 24  percent in January) to 44 percent in February. Similarly, there  was a decrease in the number of enterprises at which exports  dropped. For March, a decline in exports is anticipated at only  6 percent of enterprises, and at 54 percent the existing level  of exports will be maintained. In the opinion of the  enterprises, exports will stabilize because the contracts  concluded for 1994 will be implemented.    Many producers are striving to conclude long-term trade  contracts. For example, the Widzew Wifama Machinery Plant is  negotiating a four-year contract with Iran. The Plock Mostostal  Steel Bridge Structures Plant has long-term [construction]  contracts in Africa and the Middle East. Cooperation and mutual  trade are growing in the border provinces of Poland. Slovakia  has agreed to restore border traffic based on personal identity  documents. Although border crossings are being modernized and  new ones added, the widespread opinion is that they are still  too few. Moreover, the absence of superhighways, harbor  transloading terminals, and ferry bases clearly hobbles foreign  trade.    In the opinion of those responding to the CUP poll, the  transit of goods across Poland in all directions should become  one of the foundations of our economic strategy. For example,  the expansion of the Gdynia seaport and the [construction of  the] North-South Trans-European Highway would serve to absorb  transit traffic from Scandinavia to the Middle East. In  addition, a project for laying a broad-gauge railroad line from  the Belarus border to the seaports of the Gdynia-Gdansk-Sopot  Tricity is being considered. For the time being, however, the  planning of highway construction is limited by the lack of funds  needed for preliminary work and the acquisition of land. Greater  interest is shown on the regional scale; for example, a  consortium for building the East-West Highway was formed in  Wielkopolska.  <H5>  On the Job Market </H5>   In February, employment declined at 22 percent of the  enterprises polled. In March, it is expected to decline at only  11.5 percent and to increase at 6 percent. An adequate level of  employment was reported by 64 percent of the enterprises, an  excessive level by 32 percent, and an insufficient level by 4  percent. Following an initial period of restructuring and  cutbacks in employment, the enterprises are beginning to expand,  explore new markets, and hire needed experts.    The pattern of the ownership structure at enterprises  subject  to voivodes [province governors] is steadily changing. In Leszno  Voivodship, one-half of 56 such enterprises became privatized  (chiefly through a leasing procedure), in Bydgoszcz Voivodship  22 plants, and in Torun Voivodship 27. In Lodz Voivodship,  ownership transformations in the past four years extended to 110  plants, of which 80 percent became employee-owned companies.  This undermines the notion that state assets are being sold out  to foreign investors. However, such investors did participate in  successful privatization projects such as those concerning the  Dresso Knitwear Factory, the Lodz Papermaking Plant, the Pabia  ZPO, Elta, and Wizamet.    In some cases, the decision to privatize has met with  protest  and resistance from trade unions and workforces, as, for  example, at the Szczecin Shipyard, the Ozarow Cement Plant, and  the Tobacco Factory in Krakow. Disputes in such controversial  cases are delaying privatization.</p>

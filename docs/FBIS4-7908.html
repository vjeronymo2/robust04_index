			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 4 (CTK) -- The fact a leading  member of the Slovak National Party (SNS) took part in the  weekend pan-Slavic congress shows the party's political line is  not just the personal deviation of the new chairman but of the  whole party, Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) chairman Jan  Carnogursky told CTK today.    Carnogursky was referring to the involvement of SNS deputy  chairman Juraj Molnar in the Moscow-held congress on Sunday  which was organized by radical Russian nationalist Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy.    Vladimir Miskovsky, deputy for the National Democratic  Party-New Alternative (NDSDA) which arose from the division of  the SNS, said honorary chairman of the SNS Jozef Prokes should  be asked his views on Molnar's attendance at the congress,  Prokes being shadow foreign minister. "He is in the same party  as Mr Molnar and certainly knows best of all what Slovakia's  state interests are," he said.    Chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement  (MKDH) in the Slovak parliament Bela Bugar declared he was  insulted merely by the fact Slovakia was represented at the  congress. "Zhirinovskiy and his statements are known almost to  little children now as well," he told CTK. "Unfortunately it  must be said the rest of the world behaves towards this man  somewhat laxly. It reminds me of 1938 and later times," he said.    Even though the SNS had not authorized Molnar to speak at  the  congress, as SNS chairman Jan Slota claimed today, Molnar still  had had the authority to go, Bugar said. "I don't think that in  this way we will contribute to rapprochement among nations. The  SNS has revealed to us another of its profiles," he said.    The pan-Slavic congress was the fifth congress of  Zhirinovskiy's Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR). Participants  agreed on the creation of a Union of Slav Nations and elected  Zhirinovskiy himself as president of the "Slav parliament".    At the congress Molnar said independent Slovakia had  realized  that "if Slav are not united we shall not exist". "It's in our  interest to know what role in Central Europe Slovakia will play  if the LDPR wins in Russia," he told CTK.</p>

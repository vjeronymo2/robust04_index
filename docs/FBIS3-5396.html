The U.S. imperialists' current step to deploy Apache  helicopters, which are known to be the main offensive  helicopters of the U.S. Army, is part of arms buildup maneuvers  intended for a northward invasion, and is very alarming  [simsangchi anta].    Just as the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks is at hand, the  U.S. imperialists are running wild with arms buildup maneuvers  intended for a northward invasion. This clearly shows that they  have no faithfulness [sinui] and sincerity as a dialogue partner  and are continually creating disturbances [changae] in DPRK-U.S.  talks.</p>

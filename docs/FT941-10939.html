			<p>940207 FT  07 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: London Gilts are likely to face a difficult week after the gloomy news on international interest rates. The Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged and the Fed's move to tighten US monetary policy seem to have reduced the prospects of a cut in UK rates. Debate will concentrate on whether the Fed move is a turning point and heralds the end of the long bull market in international bonds. Gilt sentiment may accordingly be dominated by the reaction of the US and German government bond markets. Gilt enthusiasts will emphasise the positive UK economic background and the level of real yields which are relatively high, in historical term. Bears may see worrying signs in the government's easy acceptance of the public sector pay deal. With little UK economic news to go on, the week's main event will be the Bank of England's inflation report, out on Tuesday. This is likely to present a benign view of inflation, especially as the outlook has improved since the last report in November. However, last week's Treasury monetary report painted an upbeat picture of economic growth, indicating that the Bank may keep rates unchanged for the moment. A March/April cut, to soften the impact of the forthcoming tax package, continues to be favoured by the markets.</p>

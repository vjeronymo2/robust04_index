			<p>BFN     [Text] Of late President Askar Akayev of Kyrgyzstan has had  a surgical operation, reports the international ASIA newspaper.  The population, who very often see him attending meetings or  speaking on television, is unlikely to think the president is  prone to fall ill. The president, who looks quite fit, was  operated on at one of the hospitals in Moscow and resumed his  duties immediately after his return to the Republic.</p>

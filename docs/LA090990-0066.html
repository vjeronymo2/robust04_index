			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: MORE COS TO COME  </P> <P> Although this summer's "Ghost Dad" failed to boost Bill Cosby's big-screen  career -- particularly after the notorious failure of his previous film,  "Leonard Part 6" (1987) -- he's actively developing several scripts at  Universal, which is ready and willing to back another Cosby feature.  </P> <P> That's according to Stanley Robertson, Cosby's producing partner -- and  confirmed by the studio, which considers Cosby "a member of the Universal  family," according to a spokesman.  </P> <P> Robertson praises the studio for its marketing of "Ghost Dad," and blames  critics for its disappointing gross: $22 million.  </P> <P> "Our feeling is that we made a picture that deserved much better treatment,"  Robertson says, pointing to strong approval ratings from audience surveys. "We  got bashed unfairly by the critics. Some of the reviews were mean-spirited."  </P> <P> Both comedies and dramas are being considered for Cosby's next outing,  Robertson says.  </P> <P> "I'm not saying it ("Ghost Dad") was a perfect picture," he adds. "It didn't  live up to everyone's expectations. Next time, we're going to do a better  movie.  </P> <P> "But we're not ashamed of it."  </P></p>

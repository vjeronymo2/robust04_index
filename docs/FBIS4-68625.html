			<p>Criticized   <F P=102>   944K1161A Moscow ROSSIYA in Russian No 14, 13-19 Apr 94 p 2 </F> <F P=103> 944K1161A </F> <F P=104>  Moscow ROSSIYA </F> <F P=105>  Russian </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Kolinko: "Kravchuk Gives Up the </F> Missiles, but Chernobyl Is Still Usable"]    [Text] Kiev--Although one of the latest presidential acts  was not completely odious, it has prompted a response in the  form of a collective letter from three ministers, as well as a  "roundtable" of 19 state, public, and political organizations in  Ukraine. The act in question is the Ukrainian president's edict  "On Immediate Measures Aimed at Development of Nuclear Power  Generation and Building a Nuclear Fuel Cycle in Ukraine."    The edict outlines the way of accelerated development of  nuclear industry and of Ukraine building its own nuclear fuel  cycle, from the production of uranium ore to the processing of  nuclear waste. The Ukrainian Government is instructed to put on  line over the next two years four power generators at Ukrainian  nuclear stations, including the damaged No. 2 generator at the  Chernobyl AES [Nuclear Electric Power Station].    In the opinion of jurists, the edict contains several  serious  "flops." First, it assigns administrative oversight of the  nuclear industry to the Goskomatom [State Atomic Energy  Committee of Ukraine], including such a sensitive part of it as  radioactive waste disposal. This is in fundamental contradiction  to the principle of state regulation of safety and  administration of nuclear industry, which separates the  competence with respect to exploitation of nuclear facilities  and radioactive waste disposal. Second, the edict envisages  creating a medical-hygienic administration in the Goskomatom  system, which is a violation of Ukraine's health care  legislation. Third, keeping the text of this edict secret from  the Ukrainian population is in violation of Articles 9-11 of the  Ukrainian Law on Environmental Protection.    In addition to legal shortcomings, the edict also presents a  number of logical puzzles. For instance, it is difficult to  reconcile the decision on export of electric power, which is a  part of the decree, with statements about catastrophic shortage  of power in Ukraine. Especially considering that it is because  of the alleged shortage of electric power that the development  of the nuclear industry is being considered in the first place...    The "roundtable" participants (among whom, in addition to  the  "greens," were representatives of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet,  the leadership of the National Commission for Protecting the  Population From Radiation, the Ukrainian Peace Council, and the  All-Ukraine Human Rights Committee, and others) demanded Leonid  Kravchuk repeal the edict. An identical appeal came from the  ministers of health protection and environmental protection, and  the minister for protection of the population from the  consequences of the Chernobyl disaster, as well as the chairman  of Ukrainian State Atomic Industry Oversight.    By the way, a few days ago IAEA General Director Hans Blix  [name as transliterated] informed Leonid Kravchuk of the  conclusion reached by experts of this international  organization: They concluded that Chernobyl AES does not meet  international safety norms.</p>

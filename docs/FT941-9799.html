			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Westland steps up its offensive against GKN Westland, the helicopter manufacturer, yesterday stepped up its offensive against GKN's hostile bid by suggesting the engineering group had overstated the size of its shareholding. Launching its bid last Wednesday, GKN said it controlled 47 per cent of the Yeovil-based company - comprising its existing 28.3 per cent stake and a further 18.7 per cent acquired from United Technologies, the US parent of Sikorsky helicopters. Yesterday, however, Westland told the Stock Exchange that GKN's increased interest had been diluted to 45 per cent by the issue on January 31 of 6.6m ordinary shares. The extra shares were issued to investors exercising annual conversion rights on warrants and cumulative preference shares. Shares in the engineering and industrial services group fell 3p to 557p on the news. Since launching the bid, GKN's share price has fallen by more than 4 per cent. Westland, meanwhile, has seen its shares climb steadily. Although they fell 4p yesterday, the 333p close represented a 14.8 per cent premium over GKN's 290p a share bid and a 29p rise on the week. Nevertheless, the aggregate fully diluted interest held by GKN remains 40 per cent and the company said it remained confident of winning full control.</p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> UTILITY PLAYS HOST TO JURY AFTER FAVORABLE VERDICT  </P> <P> Dallas jurors who gave Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co. a favorable verdict in  a $419-million lawsuit will be flown to Houston at the utility's expense for a  tour of its nuclear plant and a stay at a luxury hotel.  </P> <P> The utility confirmed that it invited the jurors about a month ago, the Houston  Chronicle reported today.  </P> <P> Spokesman Graham Painter said that because the jurors' role in the case is  over, there is nothing improper about HL&amp;P Chairman Don Jordan playing host  and showing off the plant.  </P> <P> He did not know how many jurors would accept the offer, nor would he estimate  the cost of the air fare and overnight accommodations during the trip this  weekend.  </P> <P> The jurors decided in July that the utility's partner in the South Texas  Nuclear Project, the city of Austin, deserved no damages for HL&amp;P's  withholding information that would have allowed the city to anticipate huge  cost overruns.  </P> <P> City officials in Austin said the invitation to jurors and the judge was just  the latest impropriety in the utility's push for the plant, whose cost  ballooned from $900 million to almost $6 billion.  </P> <P> "It's highly unprofessional and very questionable. Until the people of Texas  realize that this sort of shenanigans cost the people hundreds of millions of  dollars, it won't stop," said City Councilman George Humphrey.  </P> <P> "When you have a jury that rules the defendant is guilty and awards no damages  and a short time later, they're offered free air fare, free lodging, free meals  and first-class treatment, it can't help but cast a doubt."  </P></p>

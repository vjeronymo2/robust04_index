			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [By Yi Sang-ki, HANGYORE political reporter: "Kim Yong-sam, </F> Yi Pyong-tae and the Hanahoe Generals"]    [Text] The periodic spring personnel changes, announced  every April, has become a focus of attention inside and outside  the military as the time draws near. They are the first  regularly scheduled changes under Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae,  an ex-member of Hanahoe--the No. 1 target of reform last  year--and, therefore, how he will treat Hanahoe officers is a  matter of great concern.    The upcoming announcements are especially noteworthy in that  they will provide a clue to the future direction of the Kim  Yong-sam government's control of the military. Therefore, it is  not a bad guess that both the military leadership and Chongwadae  are in agony over this process confronting them. In that agony,  merits and demerits of reforms last year are evidently working  as a guide.    Aside from how Hanahoe officers will be treated, the coming  changes are drawing attention to such questions as: Whether or  not the command leadership will be replaced, and if they are,  how extensively, and how substantially the newly created  Deliberation Committee on Proposed Appointments will exercise  its screening power. Also noteworthy will be changes involving  Navy and Air Force officers. Also, a great majority of  officers, remembering that the fall personnel changes last year  were affected by considerations of private connections with the  command leadership, are interested in knowing whether the  problem will be corrected this time.    Informed military sources forecast that the upcoming changes  will be kept within a narrow range. In substance, however, they  are of important significance in that they are to show the will  of the supreme commander and the future direction of his  personnel management.    Speculation that the April changes--which may be moved up to  late March because of the president's scheduled visits to Japan  and China and the need for an early stabilization of the  military--will be on a small-scale are based on the following  factors:    First, President Kim, through five or six shakeups he  carried  out last year, has established his control over the military and  is confident of his leadership as supreme commander. In other  words, the president must have decided, they say, that there no  longer exists the possibility of the military challenging him or  rebelling against him. It can be said that the experience gained  from the side-effects of the frequent shakeups last year--which  even caused vacillations among commanding officers in some  units--also contributed to this observation.    Therefore, the president clearly intends, they claim, to use  maximum restraints on unnecessary changes for the sake of  stability within the military. In addition, there was the death  of Cho Kun-hae, chief of the general staff [CGS] of the Air  Force, in the line of duty in a helicopter crash on 3 March. It  is feared that another sweeping shakeup at this time could  plunge the military into a vortex again.    In his speeches to the commencement exercises of the Army,  Navy, and Air Force academies, held successively on 2, 4, and 8  March, President Kim said that "there were times when the honor  of the great majority of our military personnel treading their  honorable path was undermined." He gave the impression that it  was not the same president who dismissed Kim Chin-yong as the  CGS of the Army and So Wan-su as the commander of the Defense  Security Command [DSC], in a blitz about this time last year.    "The military life is a difficult and severe one. But it is  an honorable one for the fatherland and the nation," the  president declared for the sake of the honor of the military. He  pledged to pay greater attention to lifting the morale of  personnel as well as to programs for science-based national  defense and the training of specialist manpower. In other words,  the president, who consistently had relied on the "stick" in  military management, has now promised the "carrot."    The general observation is that as a result of such changes  in the president's policy and perception toward the military, he  will likely give priority to stability and consequently will  avoid replacing the Army's top leadership after all.    In fact, at a year-end Chongwadae dinner party for major  commanders of each service last year, President Kim, in his  conversation with Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, referred to reports of  shells that had fallen on school playgrounds, chiding him that  "there is some laxity in the Army these days." But the president  called in the CGS to Chongwadae in February this year to  encourage him, it was confirmed.    Since it is viewed as a certainty that there will be no  reshuffle of the leadership of each service, it will be  noteworthy whether the Ministry of National Defense [MND] and  the leadership of each service will be able to achieve stability  and harmony through the upcoming changes and, at the same time,  resolve the private organization issue in an amicable fashion.    It can be said that the authority over the changes was, in  effect, transferred to the MND minister and the chiefs of staff  of the respective services. This is because it has become  virtually certain that there will be no changes this time  involving four-star generals, which are normally made by the  president in person. Although some in the Army think that Gen  Kim Chae-chang (18th class of the Military Academy [MA]), deputy  commander of the Combined Forces Command [CFC], will be replaced  because he is a Hanahoe officer, a majority believe that he will  be retained because he was appointed by President Kim and,  moreover, is outstanding as a military diplomat with the U.S.  authorities and as a leader of operations.    Even if there are no direct personnel actions by Chongwadae  for the foregoing reason, it is still doubtful that the present  military leadership, including MND Minister Yi Pyong-tae, Army  CGS Kim Tong-chin, Chief of Naval Operations Kim Hong-yol, and  Air Force CGS Kim Hong-nae, will independently exercise their  rights of personnel management; rather, Chongwadae is likely to  influence them one way or another. "It proves that the military  has been accustomed to the exercise of its rights by Chongwadae  throughout last year," officers say.    Meanwhile, under the military personnel law revised late  last  year, a committee to consider proposed changes involving general  officers was created to bolster the MND minister's authority.  How the MND minister will exercise his strengthened authority  remains to be seen. In the past, the MND minister's authority  over CGS-recommended promotions for general officers was a mere  formality; however, the new law empowered him to examine and  screen the proposed promotions.    It is worthy of note that, unlike the days of former MND  Minister Kwon Yong-hae when the minister and the Army CGS formed  a single, vertical command system, currently they are from the  same MA class and this is another factor drawing attention to  the coming personnel changes. In particular, MND Minister Yi  Pyong-tae's background relating to Hanahoe--the private  organization whose members CGS Kim Tong-chin decided last year  to exclude from considerations for promotions in principle--is  complicating the situation, making it difficult to work out  adjustments until the last minute, according to reports.    Since the MND is exercising its screening power for the  first  time, it is of course expected to go all the way trying to  coordinate with each service on their lists of officers to be  considered for promotions. Therefore, military sources foresee  that there will be no cases of proposed promotions being turned  down by the MND.    Consequently, actions on Hanahoe officers will inevitably be  a focus of the spring personnel changes after all. On this  point, the general observation is that MND Minister Yi, who is  one of them, has no plan yet. He himself has on no occasion  given any hint at all on his attitude toward Hanahoe.    After Col Paek Sung-to (MA 31st class) distributed a Hanahoe  namelist in early April last year, officers whose names were on  the list, even including field-level officers, were put at a  disadvantage in their military life last year. The eyes of these  officers and of outsiders are now fixed on the Army leadership  to see if they will be again refused to be considered for  promotions/reassignments this year again.    Former MND Minister Kwon Yong-hae and Army CGS Kim Tong-chin  made it clear last year that "Hanahoe officers will be put at a  disadvantage in terms of promotion in the first year, they will  be treated on the same basis with their colleagues of the same  MA class from the second year on." If so, there will probably be  a relief for them this year.    However, since Yi Pyong-tae was installed as MND minister  last year, there has been an atmosphere surging in the military  stifling a settlement on the Hanahoe since. Meanwhile, in a  year-end interview with Chongwadae reporters, President Kim  explained his action in appointing Yi to the MND post, saying  that "although he belonged to Hanahoe, he had never been a  leader of it. Moreover, he has a strong will for reform." As  seen in that remark, Chongwadae seems to be shifting to  appeasement in resolving the Hanahoe issue.    On the other hand, an anti-Hanahoe climate, combined with an  anti-Yi Pyong-tae mood, has brought a high wind to the Army,  according to informed sources. In his first days as MND  minister, Yi, like Don Quixote, inundated leaders of each  service with directives, which led to the creation of an Army  "7-Day Camping Team" -- and after debates, the team issued a  report defining Hanahoe as the "enemy within," binding Yi hand  and foot.    It occurred in early January. As contents of the report were  partly leaked to media, they resulted in narrowing Yi's options,  whose obtrusive acts already had caused strong distrust among  military leaders in resolving the Hanahoe issue, according to  sources familiar with affairs inside the military.    Until immediately before that, or late December, Yi  reportedly had been planning to complete actions on Hanahoe  generals with no more than the releases of Kim Sang-chun (MA  19th class, director of the operational planning headquarters of  the Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS]) and Yi Tae-hyong (MA 19th  class, director of the war potential planning headquarters of  the JCS) from their respective posts. However, as the 7-Day  Camping Team report defining Hanahoe as the "enemy within" was  leaked, it inevitably narrowed Yi's options on the Hanahoe issue.    The anti-Hanahoe offensive escalated, forcing the Army  leadership to attempt to persuade Hanahoe generals on the Army  Headquarters Policy Committee and those awaiting their  retirement to voluntarily retire from active service. In  January, Kwak Tong-to (MA 21st class, major general) visited Lt  Gen Yi Taek-hyong and Lt Gen Ham Tok-son (both MA 20th class,  former 11th Corps commanders) and Kim Chong-pae (MA 20th class,  former 3d Army commander) separately, who were moping away their  time in the Policy Committee research room next to the Army  Headquarters Seoul office in the MND building, to advise them to  retire on their own.    The generals, except one, refused to follow the advice. Some  of them expressed their displeasure, saying that "it could be  different if the CGS in person comes to see me on that but...,"  according to reports.    They are said to have stated that "for us, it is not a big  thing to retire, but we find it absolutely unacceptable unless  there is a measure taken to rehabilitate those junior officers  who were discriminated against merely because their names were  on the reported list." Some were known to have even mentioned  the legal retirement-age clause. Others rejected the idea of  voluntary retirement, saying such retirement can be compared to  dishonorable discharge.    Thus, the Army leadership's effort to coax Hanahoe generals  into retirement ended in failure. To be exact, however, nobody  in the military, even among Hanahoe officers themselves,  believes that they can make a comeback from where they are  awaiting their retirement.    Meanwhile, away from those lieutenant-general or  major-general level officers who are either on the Army  Headquarters Policy Committee or officially awaiting their  retirement, there are the cases of Hanahoe generals still active  in field army, MND or JCS posts. As for the latter cases, it is  rumored that they will be possibly rescued on a selective basis.  Such rescue of course will more likely take the form of  reassignment rather than promotion, according to informed  military sources.    Based on these speculations, it is also said that in the  reassignments of field-level officers being announced after the  spring changes for generals, the scope of reassignments for  Hanahoe officers in particular will be considerably expanded.    Of the lieutenant-colonel and colonel-level field officers  who graduated from the MA in the 27th-36th classes,  approximately 10 Hanahoe officers in each class were demoted  last summer from their key positions in the so-called big three  commands--the Capital Garrison Command, the Special Force  Command and the DSC--or from major posts in the Personnel  Management office of the Army Headquarters, the Personnel Staff  Headquarters, the MND and the JCS to leisurely assignments in  educational centers or other front-line or rear units.    What sort of reassignments they will get will inevitably  draw  attention because they are linked to the rescue for them in the  periodic fall promotions later this year. Commenting on the  issue of field-level Hanahoe officers, a high MND official said  that "since it is a very delicate problem, the MND has not yet  adopted an official position. But I expect that when it does, it  will be in favor of their rescue." "Whether they are rescued or  again passed over for promotions, there will be repercussions.  In that case, it will be wise to minimize sacrifices," he noted.    The same official added that the shift to stability,  solidarity, and enhancement of the morale in the president's new  policy for the military is another factor backing up that  possibility.    Concerning the question of treatment for field-level Hanahoe  officers, a considerably large number of personnel pointed out  that several factors other than such high policy-level  considerations will work as variables.    Needless to say, it is true that some in the military are  persistently demanding--as the 7-Day Camping Team report  did--that Hanahoe officers be removed. Their point is that they  had received special favors as Hanahoe members in the past in  promotions and assignments, and that as such, they are negative  elements damaging solidarity of the military and, therefore,  should be rooted out. Otherwise, it is impossible to hope for  the development and reform of the military, they contend.    Their contention, however, became less persuasive as time  passed over the past year, according to analysts. In the process  of military reform, the removal of Hanahoe did not produce an  idealistic picture as anticipated. To make it worse, the sparks  began flying in an undesirable direction. Rumors widely  circulating have it that posts vacated by Hanahoe officers were  filled by people having personal school, regional, or service  ties with the leadership formed after the start of the new  government, causing discontent and distrust in the military.    In other words, factionalism and flattery are widespread in  the military in the wake of such display of favoritism, even to  the extent of creating a climate filled with nostalgia for the  past. The following is a comment by Lieutenant Colonel "K", a  non-Hanahoe officer working in an educational center which had  been a place for about-to-retire officers before becoming a  "place of exile" for Hanahoe officers:    "It is understandable that under the new government, those  who had received special favors as Hanahoe members in the past  were demoted from their posts for the sake of balance with other  officers. However, I cannot understand why they had to be  reassigned to an educational center. They are the people who  were telling us that education is the most important thing; it  is clearly contradictory that they send them to an educational  center now. How could an education center could be a place of  exile? When they saw the announced promotions in the periodic  fall changes last year, some of which could have been totally  unthinkable in the past, I heard many say that `the old days  were still better.' Speaking of colleagues in my unit, they had  first disapproved of Hanahoe officers but, after months now,  those who are sympathetic with them for their capabilities and  their attitudes are rapidly increasing in number."    Officers maintain that this sort of sentiment in the minds  of  non-Hanahoe officers is fueling dissatisfaction with the present  Army leadership.    Some of them, along with Hanahoe officers, unhesitatingly  complain that "the personnel changes last year were, in a  nutshell, reassignments and promotions to fill Hanahoe-vacated  posts with cronies of the military leadership." According to  them, "the military leadership is taking advantage of the vacuum  and, under the pretext of reform, is preoccupied with expanding  its own influence." They contend that friction, factionalism and  the feelings of helplessness are spreading in the military and  that there is an urgent need to correct the situation. What they  say is increasing its persuasion.    Chongwadae announced in a self-appraisal in February that  the  army-level commanding officers (four-star generals) were all  replaced in the first year of the Kim Yong-sam government. Also  replaced in this period, it said, were 73% of the  corps-level  commanders (lieutenant generals) and 63% of the  division-level  commanders (major generals). The who replaced them in this  process were generals of the "new power group" of the  single-line influence represented by Kwon Yong-hae, former MND  minister, and Army CGS Kim Tong-chin, officers say.    Some people are apprehensively concerned that since Yi  Pyong-tae took over as MND minister, however, there have been  signs of the single command channel breaking into a dual one.  According to them, the military in the Sixth Republic days  could maintain its balance under the watchful eyes of Hanahoe  from the Fifth Republic and the 9.9 [9th Div., 9th Airborne  Brig.] clique; nowadays, however, the 9.9 clique, along with  those close to former MND minister Kwon and CGS Kim, formed the  power group and this group is thoroughly blocking Hanahoe and  other rival groups.    Among the generals of the new power group, some are capable  and well qualified, like Lieutenant General "K" and Major  General "H" in the MND and Major General "L" in the Army  Headquarters, while others are apparently ill-qualified for  their posts. Those riding on their private relationships with  the military leadership have become objects of distrust among  junior officers.    In extreme cases, some generals are bent on finding a pull  with Chongwadae, National Assembly and other political  personages, not to mention the military leadership. Rumors  circulating in the military have it that some even went all the  way to Koje Island at the beginning of the year to perform a  formal New Year's bow to President Kim's father, Kim Hong-cho.    In the military today, the following people represent about  all promoted by Kwon Yong-hae in his minister days: 3d Army  Commander Yun Yong-nam (MA 19th class) and MND Policy Office  Director Cho Song-tae (MA 20th class) who had been both Kwon's  policy planning officers in the MND when Kwon was vice minister;  9th Corps Deputy Commander Yim Chong-sop (MA 22d class; former  chief of the personnel staff) and Infantry School Commandant  Pyon Kil-nam (MA 22d class), who were respectively the commander  of the 6th Division infantry regiment and the artillery regiment  when Kwon was the commander of that division; and Field Division  Commander O Nam-yong (MA 24th class), who was Kwon's aide.    It is different with Army CGS Kim Tong-chin. A graduate of  Kyongbok High School, which turned out many personages currently  active in power circles, he served in all types of field and  policy posts, including 1st Div. commander, 5th Army commander,  MND Policy Office director, and ROK-U.S. CFC deputy commander.  Thus, he is said to have developed much broader personal ties  than Kwon.    First, among those who graduated from the same high school  after him are: Maj.Gen. Sin Yang-ho (MA 22d class) of the JCS,  Hanahoe officer; Chon Kwan (MA 23d class) and Kim Hui-sang (MA  24th class), both commanders of major divisions in the  metropolitan area; and Maj.Gen. Hong Sun-ho (ROTC 4th class),  rear division commander.    Lieutenant Colonel "H", currently assigned to a major post  in  the DSC as successor of a Hanahoe officer, is another person  drawing attention inside and outside the military because he is  another Kyongbok High graduate.    A fairly large number of general officers who had been his  colleagues in the service were promoted by CGS Kim and, for that  reason, people often bear them a spite regardless of their  abilities.    To Il-kyu (MA 20th class), commander of the Capital Garrison  Command, served as deputy chief of staff when CGS Kim was CFC  deputy commander; Brigade Commander "K", promoted to the present  post last year, was Kim's colleague when they were both section  chiefs. Lt.Gen. Chang Chang-kyu (MA 21st class), commander of  the Special Force Command, and Lt.Gen. Yi Yu-su (MA 20th class),  corps commander, served as a division commander and a armored  brigade commander when Kim was the corps commander.    Maj.Gen. An Song-yong (MA 23d class) and Maj.Gen. Yi  Chong-ok  (MA 24th class), who both were reassigned as field division  commanders on their promotion to major general last year, were  also Kim's colleagues who served respectively as chief of staff  and operations chief in those days. And Maj.Gen. Kim Sok-won  (former Grade-A selectee), chief of the Army Headquarters  operational staff division, and Maj.Gen. Yang In-mok (MA 22d  class), chief of the munitions staff division, were a battalion  commander and a regimental commander respectively when Kim was  the division commander. Maj.Gen. Kang Chong-pil (MA 23d class),  of a field army, was also a battalion commander in the same  period.    Maj.Gen. Chong Yong-chin (MA 23d class), a field division  commander, and Brig.Gen. Yim Su-won, Army Headquarters personnel  management superintendent, served as battalion commanders when  CGS Kim was the commander of 62d Regiment of 20th Division.    In addition, it is known that Brig.Gen. "H" of the  communications force and Brig.Gen. "Y" of the engineer force  served as communications corps commander and engineer brigade  commanders respectively when Kim was the commander of 5th Corps.    Over the fact that so many people who had personal  relationships with CGS Kim through work were promoted to major  posts, opinions are divided in the military. Some say that "for  reform of the military in a transitional period, it is necessary  for a leader to promote, and use effectively people whom he can  trust absolutely." "At a time when every move of the leadership  in the Army Headquarters at Kyeryongdae becomes known to the  foremost front in a matter of a few hours, you cannot but pick a  person you can trust if you are to choose from among people with  little difference in abilities."    Others argue, as strongly: "The true consummation of reform  lies in the vitalization of the organization. But his conduct of  personnel management focused on private relationships and  deepening distrust among members of the organization. It is  imperative that the military display its organizational power in  perfect order at a time of emergency, and in this organization,  complaints about personnel management directly lead to the  weakening of combat power."    These people also point out that "the reason the 12.12  [1979]  coup by Hanahoe was possible was that at the time they did not  operate by the dynamics and logic of the organization but were  banded by private ties."    Therefore, officers who see problems in the leanings of the  military leadership and its domains say that they are concerned  about what sort of expressions they will find in the coming  changes. For now, they expect that thanks to the appointment of  Yi Pyong-tae as MND minister, the leanings will be eased to  considerable degrees.    On the other hand, the 9.9 group--which, along with people  close to CGS Kim, forms the new power group--includes these  people: Kim Hyong-son (MA 19th class), deputy chief of staff;  Lt.Gen. Yi Kyu-hwan (MA 21st class), field corps commander; So  Kyong-sok (ROTC 3d class), chief of staff of the Education  Command; Yi Yong-tae (ROTC 4th class), field division commander;  and Maj.Gen. Chon Kwan (MA 23d class).    They are people who served in the 9th Division, 9th Airborne  Brigade in the past when former President No Tae-u was the  commander of these units. Along with the Hanahoe clique of  former President Chon Tu-hwan, who was once the commander of the  1st Division, 1st Airborne Brigade, they were known to be the  mainstream of the military in the Sixth Republic.    Unlike Hanahoe, the 9.9 group is generally in good shape  under the new government. Explaining the reason, a general  officer said: "Soon after the start of the new government, the  military leadership, which had not yet formed its own influence,  found it beyond its capacity to remove Hanahoe, the biggest  influence in the country in the past decade. Based on that  judgment, it apparently tried to remove Hanahoe's resistance by  forming an alliance with the 9.9 group." Another general said  that "the balance of power in the military is not determined by  factors inside the military alone." "The new government," he  continued, "needed the help of the 9.9 group, the second largest  clique in the military, to establish its control over the  military. It must have had the understanding of, and the  coordinating with, former President No Tae-u about it." "It  should also be noted," he added, "that in the latter half of the  Sixth Republic, when Kim Yong-sam changed his coat to join the  ruling party, a substantially large number of military leaders  pledged loyalty to him, and that those leaders were mostly  members of the 9.9 group."    Of late, with the personnel changes approaching, rumors  about  private organizations named Mannahoe and Nanumhoe, and their  relationships with the new power group, are circulating rather  widely in the Army, straining the Army which had its measles in  the Hanahoe namelist incident in April last year.    This is not the first time that people hear rumors of third  private organizations in the military. This time, however, they  are drawing extraordinary attention because of the time factor.    At the parliamentary hearings about the DSC at the time of  the National Assembly inspection of government offices in  October last year last year, Kim To-yun, then commander of the  DSC, stated that "40-odd private organizations have been  unveiled and disbanded since the start of the new government,"  making no mention of Mannahoe or Nanumhoe though. Rep. Kang  Chang-song of the Democratic Party has been saying since early  last year that "in addition to Hanahoe and Alcchahoe, there is  Mannahoe in the military."    According to informed military sources, Mannahoe is led by  "L", a former CGS, and "K", a retired four-star general, who  were estranged by Hanahoe immediately before the start of the  Sixth Republic. It is composed, they say, by officers of the MA  15th through 29th classes, seven or eight of them from each  class. According to rumors, this group was involved in the  Hanahoe namelist incident last year; however, it is known that  the official investigation into the incident failed to shed  light on it.    Some in the military insist that the current rumors of the  existence of Mannahoe and its identity are considerably at  variance with facts. According to them, all that "L" and  "K"--who, while in the military, had a strong antipathy against  Hanahoe--did was to hold gatherings, based on personal  friendship, to press Hanahoe into dissolution, and nothing else.    Others say that this private organization, which initially  had little influence in the military, has grown into a powerful  one as it occupied major posts taking advantage of the power  vacuum immediately after the start of the new government.    According to informed sources, those classified as Mannahoe  members include such influential figures as "K", "J", "L", and  "P" (all major generals) and "K" and "L" (both brigadier  generals) and "P" and "K" (colonels). With respect to Nanumhoe,  another private organization, there are also a great deal of  "rumors" circulating lately. Nanumhoe is known to be composed  of field-level officers of the MA 30th through 37th classes,  specialist officers in personnel management in particular. The  identity of this group reportedly was first unveiled in the  military in about 1986.    Nanumhoe was first formed as a social gathering of officers  of the MA 30th and 31st classes in the Office of Personnel  Management Superintendent, expanding its influence after Colonel  "P" introduced them to General "L" and General "K", according to  reports. This group maintains a close relationship with  Mannahoe, say informed sources. Colonels "K" and "P" of the MA  30th class, another Colonel "K" of the same class, and Colonels  "J", "P", and "L" of the MA 31st class are reported to be the  leaders of Nanumhoe.    Military sources say that inasmuch as the various rumors  currently circulating about Mannahoe and Nanumhoe have the  possibility of causing vacillations and tumult again in the  military, authorities should look into them and make facts  clear. They are concerned, they say, that there is the danger of  the military being thrown into another Hanahoe-type vortex.    Officers are unanimous in saying that the upcoming changes  should be carried out in a fair and reasonable fashion, that at  the same time, there should be objective light shed on the  rumors that are currently circulating. Then, what sort of  specific changes are anticipated?    In the Army, changes are expected of two or three corps  commanders and five or six division commanders whose  replacements are approximately 18 months overdue. In particular,  the coming change of To Il-kyu (MA 20th class), commander of the  Capital Garrison Command, is drawing much attention. Some  observers say that he will get his second assignment favorable  for promotion to the four-star general rank, while others  maintain that he has served only 1 year in his current post and  therefore will be retained.    Among corps commanders, Lt Gens O Yong-u and Kim Kil-pu  (both  MA 20th class) are viewed as certain to be replaced because they  have served out their terms in the current posts. As for Kim  Kil-pu, a Hanahoe officer, whether he will get a second  assignment is a matter of great concern.    At the same time, there is a prediction that Kim Hyong-son  (MA 19th class), Army chief of staff, will also be replaced.  They [O Yong-u and Kim Hyong-son] are likely to replace Chang  Pyong-yong (MA 18th class), (?inspector general), and Chang  Sok-nin (MA 18th class), commandant of the National Defense  College, respectively, whose terms of office are to expire in  April.    The posts to be vacated by them are expected to be filled by  an MA 21st class officer and a non-MA officer or an MA graduate  respectively. It is seen as certain that there will be no MA 22d  class officers promoted to corps commanders this time. Along  with changes in the Army, it is also expected that there will be  changes carried out in the Air Force and the Marine Corps. As  for the Navy, it is known that there is no need for changes.    In the Air Force, there will be a change to fill the post of  director of the Intelligence Headquarters of the MND, which was  vacated by Kim Hong-yol who succeeded Cho Kun-hae as Air Force  CGS on the latter's death in the line of duty, plus changes  involving offices thus affected.    While the possibility of an Army general officer being  appointed to that intelligence post cannot be ruled out,  military sources expect that it will continue to be occupied by  an Air Force officer, considering the factor of the Air Force  morale after the CGS' death.    In the Marine Corps, while Rear Adm. Yi Sang-mu (Naval  Academy 17th class), 2d Division commander, is most likely to  succeed Yim Chong-nin as commandant on the expiration of Yim's  term of office, some see Rear Adm. Kwak Chae-song (Naval Academy  16th class) of the JCS office as a possible successor. Also,  these changes in the Marine Corps will be followed by the  transfers of Sin Won-pae, deputy commandant, and Chon To-pong,  special aide for the chief of Naval Operations.    The two rear admirals, Yi and Kwak, are both from the  Pusan-Kyongnam [PK] region. So, when all the changes are  completed, including those in the Marine Corps, the PK force and  Kyongbok High graduates will form the mainstream of the top  leadership of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps under  the Kim Yong-sam government, pushing aside the TK  [Taegu-Kyongbuk] force, the remnant of the Sixth Republic,  completely.</p>

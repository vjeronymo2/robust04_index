			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / The Queen's Speech: Privatisation plans are put into motion  -Main Points The government aims to secure the large-scale handover of BR's operations to the private sector much quicker than had been expected. Within days, the British Rail and British Coal (Transfer Proposals) Bill will be put to parliament, enabling essential preparatory work for the privatisation of the rail and coal industries. In the case of the railways it is expected to be followed within weeks by the much-delayed privatisation white paper and by full-blown legislation in the shape of a Rail Bill as soon as the autumn. The privatisation of British Coal was confirmed. Civil servants said yesterday the sale might take place by the end of next year.</p>

Press statement by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman:    According to reports, Japan will soon ignite Monju, its  first  fast breeder reactor. This is an undisguised attempt by Japan  to secure quantities of plutonium by itself and produce nuclear  weapons at any moment. The annual capacity of the reprocessing  plant of Japan is 800 tons, the biggest in the world. When it  goes into full operation by the end of the present century,  Japan will rank third in the world in reprocessing capacity  after the United States and France. Even according to data  released by the Japan science and technology agency, it has  already stockpiled 1.6 tons of plutonium at home and 2.9 tons  abroad and will possess 50 tons of plutonium at all times by  2010, an amount enough to make more than 6,200 nuclear bombs.    Japan has already developed not only an electronic  detonating  device and other elements for the manufacture of nuclear bombs  and their technologies but also has long-range means of nuclear  delivery that can be used as intercontinental ballistic  missiles. Facts show that Japan's nuclear armament now has  reached a dangerous phase.    In view of the tense situation in which Japan's nuclear  armament is being stepped up around the Korean peninsula in  earnest, we cannot but follow such developments with vigilance.  Japan's stepped-up nuclear armament means creating an obstacle  to the process of denuclearization on the Korean peninsula. The  denuclearization of Northeast Asia must be realized if peace and  security free from nuclear weapons are to be guaranteed  substantially in this region, including the Korean peninsula.  To this end, not only Asia but the rest of the world should pay  due attention to Japan which is capable of possessing nuclear  weapons and moving in that direction.    The denuclearization of Northeast Asia should lead to a  total  elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide.</p>

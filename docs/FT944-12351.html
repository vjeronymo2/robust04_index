			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / N Korea 'halts N-plant work' North Korea said yesterday it had halted construction of two controversial graphite-moderated reactors following a landmark pact with the US in which Pyongyang agreed to freeze and dismantle its nuclear energy programme. The agreement was signed in Geneva last month. 'We have already begun taking practical steps to put it (the pact) into effect,' a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by Korean Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo. Under the October 21 accord the US said it would assemble an international consortium to finance the Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.5bn) construction of either one 2,000MW or two 1,000MW light-water reactors that do not produce weapons-grade plutonium.</p>

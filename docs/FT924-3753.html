			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / UK snubbed over plan to end EC deadlock BRITAIN is hoping that Franco-German diplomatic efforts to break the deadlock over the European Community budget will pave the way for an agreement at next week's Edinburgh summit. But fresh doubts arose last night about prospects for resolving other issues at the summit after five Christian Democratic leaders in Europe, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, declared that a British compromise to meet Danish demands for exemptions from the Maastricht Treaty was not acceptable. The hard line signalled tough bargaining between Denmark and its European partners over the next few days. Without a resolution of the Danish question, senior diplomats predicted the summit would end in failure. Earlier in talks that took place in Bonn, Mr Kohl and French president Francois Mitterrand threw their weight behind the British presidency's urgent efforts to negotiate a complex deal to ensure a successful summit. This includes extra EC finances and a rapid start to talks with new member states. 'The fundamental idea must be that this is a Community of solidarity,' said Mr Kohl. That meant not just solidarity between the northern states and the Mediterranean countries, but equally with the new applicants in northern Europe and with the emerging democracies of eastern Europe. Mr Kohl said a deal on future financing was essential for overall agreement in Edinburgh, and hinted strongly at a willingness to move towards Spanish demands for generous funds to help the weaker economies. Spain has led a loose coalition of poorer EC countries such as Ireland and Portugal in a protest against UK proposals to limit future EC financing and scale back 'cohesion' funds agreed under the Maastricht treaty. A senior UK official in Brussels last night described Spain's position as crucial for a budget compromise. 'Their position is important and absolutely understandable,' the official said. Spain yesterday gave a lukewarm reception to Britain's proposals for solving the Danish problem. 'We are reserving our opinion at least until the foreign ministers' 'conclave' on December 8,' said a Foreign Affairs ministry spokeswoman. Madrid has expressed anger at Britain's reduction in proposed cohesion funds which were a central part of the Maastricht treaty. But the UK continued to stress that it would not agree to a reduction in the British rebate, worth about Pounds 3bn a year - despite a chorus of opposition from other EC member states.

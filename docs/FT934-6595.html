			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Arts: Massenet's magical 'Cendrillon' - Richard Fairman hails Robert Carsen's new production for WNO In Saturday's morning papers it was reported that a competition is to be held for the design of Cardiff's new opera house. What could be more fitting for Welsh National Opera that evening than this enchanting opera on the theme of a dream fulfilled? After the rediscovery of so many Massenet operas in the 1970s the composer seemed to get forgotten. Perhaps his desire to please was out of tune with the hard-nosed ethics of the next decade. Or, more likely, the new breed of radical producers assumed that his operas had nothing to offer them. How wrong they were. WNO's new production of Cendrillon is probing, stylish, up to the minute, and still sends the audience away with stars in the eyes. The opera is a fairly faithful version of Perrault's fairy-tale Cinderella. So captivating is its blend of magic, romance and humour that it seems wicked that British audiences have been denied it for so long. I have seen the opera only twice before and realise in retrospect how crudely those productions upset its delicate balance, hamming its comedy, over-sugaring its sweetness. All it needs is a touch as deft as the composer's own. In Cardiff the curtain went up on a strikingly simple set (designs by Michael Levine). A log fire burns in a late 19th-century French drawing-room. On the mantelpiece are an elegant gold clock, ready to strike twelve at midnight, and an invitation to the ball. What we do not know at this point is that the producer, Robert Carsen, is going to swivel the room around and send us out through the window into a world of enchantment. For the time being we are left with the family and servants. Father is a well-meaning man, amusingly played by Donald Maxwell, though his voice does not take too kindly to Massenet's lyrical writing. The stepmother is a snobbish bossy boots, played with devastating wit by Felicity Palmer. The scene where she enumerates every twig on her family tree, while bathing her aching feet, was killing. There are plenty of good one-liners for her in Jeremy Sams's English translation. But now Carsen casts his spell of inspiration. As Cinderella goes to sleep in front of the fire, a miniature fairy godmother (Lillian Watson, bright and twinkling, if a touch strident on the highest notes) appears at the window and turns out to be the stepmother's alter ego - her better half. The attendant fairies are none other than the household servants, tripping along daintily with silver wings sewn on to their uniforms. Wearing the fairy's blue high heels, Cinders sets off for the ball only to find Prince Charming curled up in her father's favourite armchair. Another right decision: for the first time in my experience these two roles were cast, as the composer always intended, with sopranos, Rebecca Evans as Cinderella and Pamela Helen Stephen as the Prince, each as touching as the other. Their first duet floated as hushed as a kiss on the breeze - only one of many reasons to offer gratitude to the evening's conductor, Patrick Fournillier. At last Massenet's lovely opera has the staging it deserves: its magic, its humour, its intimacy, all perfectly balanced and with a sprinkling of psychoanalysis light as fairy dust. Any regrets? Only that the ball scene omits the ballet, included by the students at the RNCM in Manchester last year. Everything else is sheer delight. A personal note to the managing director of WNO: can I come straight back for the next performance please? A co-production with Monte-Carlo, Toulouse, Turin and English National Opera. Performances in Birmingham this week, then touring to Oxford and Bristol</p>

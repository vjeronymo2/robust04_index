			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / Le Pen announces presidential candidacy Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the leader of France's extreme right National Front party, yesterday became the first French politican to announce his candidacy for next year's presidential election, John Ridding writes from Paris. Other potential candidates on the right raised the prospect of a divisive contest by hinting at their own bids for the spring contest. Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, head of the centre-right UDF party and a former president, appeared to edge closer to a new run for the Elysee, calling for measures to tackle France's acute problem of unemployment. Mr Philippe de Villiers, who won a surprising 12 per cent of the vote in June's European elections on an anti-Maastricht ticket, also indicated he might stand. The two heavyweight contenders on the right, however, prime minister Edouard Balladur and Mr Jacques Chirac, have not yet declared their intention to run, although they are engaged in a thinly veiled contest for the candidacy of their gaullist RPR party. Mr Le Pen, who advocates tough anti-immigration policies and is opposed to a federal Europe, told a rally he would also make the fight against corruption a central plank of his campaign. Mr de Villiers said he was officially breaking from the centre-right Republican party, from which he has been estranged for several months, citing corruption cases involving the PR.</p>

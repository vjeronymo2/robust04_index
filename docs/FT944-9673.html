			<p>941115 FT  15 NOV 94 / World Trade News: US signs big UK aircraft order Jetstream Aircraft, the troubled turbo-prop subsidiary of British Aerospace, has signed a contract to sell up to 60 of its Jetstream 41 commuter aircraft. The contract, which could be worth as much as Dollars 420m, is with Trans States Airlines of the US. The order will boost substantially the workload at Jetstream's sole plant at Prestwick in Ayrshire, Scotland. It will also strengthen Jetstream's hand in negotiations with other European manufacturers on a strategic alliance of turbo-prop aircraft producers. Trans States has placed firm orders for 25 Jetstream 41s, with an option for an additional 35. The first aircraft will be delivered to Trans States in St Louis, Missouri, next February, with the rest delivered during 1995 and 1996. Trans States is a regional airline which has code-sharing alliances with TWA, USAir, Northwest and Alaska. It already operates the 19-seat Jetstream 31 aircraft. Mr Hulas Kunodia, president of Trans States, said the 30-seater aircraft was selected for its ability 'to contribute to the bottom line'. It had the lowest operating cost of any 30-seat aircraft available. Large aircraft orders are particularly prized among turbo-prop aircraft producers, who have large overcapacity and a dire shortage of contracts. In October 1993 Jet- stream announced a cut of 630 in its workforce of 2,500 at Prestwick. It made an operating loss of Pounds 120m (Dollars 196.8m) in 1993 and British Aerospace made a Pounds 250m provision to cover turbo-prop leasing liabilities. Jetstream has been in talks with the Franco-Italian ATR consortium, a joint venture between Aerospatiale and Alenia, on a proposed strategic alliance on regional aircraft of 30 to 80 seats. Although there has been speculation in the industry that agreement was near, British Aeropsace yesterday refused to confirm this, and said it was also in talks with other companies. The Trans States order will strengthen Jetstream's hand in any negotiations. It has been suggested in the industry press that under an agreement with ATR, Jetstream would continue to make the Jetstream 41, but would eventually drop the less successful 70-seat Jetstream 61, a direct competitor with the Franco-Italian ATR 72. It would become involved in developing and manufacturing the 84-seat ATR 82, which ATR wants to launch early in 1995.</p>

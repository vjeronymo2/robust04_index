The National Defense communique stated that in the  town of Guadalupe Tepeyac, the transgressors of the law released  63 workers of the Social Security clinic who had been kidnapped  when the conflict began in Chiapas. The workers were taken to  the Comitan de Dominguez Garrison, where they were fed, and then  they were sent to the capital of Chiapas State.    The Defense Secretariat stated that 10 days after operations  began to reestablish order in the Chiapas highlands, clashes  between the transgressors of the law and Army troops have  decreased considerably. It added that from Monday night to  early morning Tuesday, there have been no clashes; nevertheless,  troops are continuing to guard several towns that were the  targets of the armed groups. The bulletin read that in addition  to the combing operations by the troops, several aircraft are  overflying the area to detect the groups of transgressors still  roaming around some towns. According to the communique, it has  been learned that approximately 50 transgressors abandoned their  weapons near Palenque and fled to unknown locations.</p>

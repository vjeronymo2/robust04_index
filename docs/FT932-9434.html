			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Indonesia (6): Achilles Heel of the business sector - Private banks are paying the price for injudicious lending during the 1980s PLACED in the corner of the central bank governor's waiting room last November was the medical apparatus to measure blood pressure. It was a sign, perhaps, that the banking system, burdened with non-performing loans, was taking its toll on those assigned to supervise it. Indonesia is still feeling the effects of financial sector deregulation initiated five years ago. By the end of 1992 banking sector assets had almost tripled to Rp123,689bn, while there has been concomitant growth - to over 200 - in the number of banks. While the increase in availability of credit helped to develop a new generation of profitable, export-oriented industries, not all loans were so well-placed. Indeed, rather than represent the cornerstone of growth, the sector is now the economy's greatest weakness. The problems of a rapid expansion in credit combined with ill-trained and incompetent management were highlighted last December when the government ordered the liquidation of Bank Summa, one of the country's top 10 private banks. Owned by the wealthy Soeryadjaya family, the bank became heavily exposed to property companies in which the Soeryadjayas held an interest. After domestic and international property prices fell in 1990/91, the bank's loans began to turn sour. When Bank Indonesia (BI), the central bank, finally stepped in, Bank Summa had Rp1,600bn in outstanding obligations and only a fraction of that in way of collateral. While BI officials argued that Bank Summa was a unique instance, their figures for the banking sector's non-performing loans are almost certainly too low. A week before closing Bank Summa's tills, BI put the sector's bad debts at less than Rp3,000bn and the total non-performing loans (on which no interest had been paid for three months and over) at just Rp7,400bn. Banks have shown an 'extraordinary reluctance to categorise anything as a bad debt which has been collateralised or which is outstanding to people who they believe can afford to pay,' says a senior donor official. And BI appears to have shown naivete in believing the banks' explanations of their books: collateral may be inadequate or difficult to secure, while the practice of collateralising interest payments on overdue loans to the wealthy encourages non-payment. Given the scale of Bank Summa's debts, the tales of graft within the five state commercial banks (which account for half the sector's assets) and the poor credit analysis of most private banks, the scale of problem loans may be substantial. Most bankers estimate that 25 per cent or Rp17,000bn of the state banks' loan portfolios are non-performing. Estimates of the non-performing loans of private domestic banks range from six to 15 per cent of their portfolios (Rp2,540bn-Rp6,350bn). In the worst case scenario, the non-performing loans of the sector would be equal to BI's international reserves. Of equal concern is the failure of banks to provide sufficiently against bad debt. Banking analysts say a minimum of 2.5 per cent of productive assets should be provided for non-performing loans but, in 1992, of Indonesia's top six listed banks, arguably among the country's best managed, none reached this level. Brokers treat with scepticism, therefore, the higher net-profits reported by most banks last year. A broker explains: 'If banks provided adequately for their non-performing loans, most would be running at a loss,' even given the high spreads between deposit rates of 14-16 per cent and lending rates of 22 per cent and higher. While the banking sector is fragile, however, it is not necessarily in danger of collapse. Economists point out that the relative scale of non-performing loans can be reduced by continued economic growth and natural expansion in money supply. The top private banks are currently launching large bond issues to raise new capital in anticipation of sharp increases in their deposit base and lending portfolios this year. Whether new loans, however, can be made on a more prudent basis depends largely upon better supervision by BI and the strict imposition of banking regulations. Newly installed cabinet ministers have expressed their determinations to pull the sector into line. Mr Saleh Afiff, senior economics minister, said in an interview that the government was 'very concerned about the state banks and the banking system as a whole. We have to do something ..We will take steps first to know what is the size of the bad debt.' Mr Sudradjat Djiwandono, the newly-appointed central bank governor, has a reputation as a competent, single-minded administrator and the replacement of BI's board in April has met with the approval of foreign donors. Bankers also note that steps taken by the last government to improve banking supervision should soon begin to bear fruit. Banks were told to raise their capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to seven per cent by the end of last March, a figure reached by most private banks, and to eight per cent by next year. BI has also been training-up new teams of auditors. While these have mostly confined themselves to auditing foreign banks to date, they should soon be delving into the disorderly books of the private banks. Ministers say they will insist on the merger or closure of poorly run banks. Last August the government completed a reshuffle of the state banks' boards and issued a stern warning that the practice of 'memo-lending' - where banks lend on the basis of clients' political connections, not their credit worthiness - must cease. Concerted efforts are also underway to raise the capital base of the state banks, which economists estimate needs to be doubled if they are to attain the government's CAR targets. The World Bank has made a Dollars 300m loan to inject capital into the state banks and the government has requested donor permission to convert more than Dollars 1bn in two-step loans being channeled through the state banks into either tier-two capital or equity. Consolidation within the banking sector is likely to be a slow and painful process. Last year the assets of the private domestic banks grew just 1.2 per cent. A condition of the World Bank loan to the state banks is a limit on loans growth to less than 15 per cent a year. For Indonesian businesses, therefore, new lines of domestic credit are likely to remain both hard to come by and expensive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Diplomatic Panorama" feature: Correspondents Igor </F> Porshnev, S Kolosova and others]    [Text] "Whenever something serious and positive happens in  Russia's foreign policy, it invariably causes somebody's  criticism,, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov  has told IF. He was speaking in reply to the opposition  leaders' strong criticism of Russia's joining the NATO  "Partnership for Peace" program.    The Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev signed the  program in Brussels last Wednesday. The "Russia-NATO" protocol  was adopted on the same day. "This is a serious, important  step" Panov said.    He believes that criticism expressed over the past few days  was counterproductive, because it contained no alternative or  any other proposals. "They (the opposition - IF) simply don't  like it. Probably, this is inevitable when political struggle is  afoot. But criticism must be well-founded. Otherwise it is  just not serious at all," Panov said.</p>

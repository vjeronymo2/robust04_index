			<p>Language: <F P=105> Urdu </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Smuggling of Heroin Chemicals"] </F>   [Text] According to a news report, chemicals used for  making heroin worth about one million [currency not specified]  were "cleared" at Lahore railway station on arrival by the  Samjhota Express from India. The intelligence agents later  arrested the smugglers as they emerged from the railway station,  and they have registered a case against the superintendent of  customs. The production of heroin was initially started by the  CIA in Afghanistan to creat money for supplying weapons to the  forces opposing the Soviet Union. For about a decade the United  States looked the other way. Now it considers appropriate to  ignore all its own "actions" and prefers to accuse Pakistan of  it. Against this background, if we review this incident of  seizure of chemicals used in making heroin, it is clear that  India is also involved in this drama to give Pakistan notoriety  for making heroin. The law enforcement agencies should keep all  this in mind and arrest the involved persons.</p>

			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / World Trade News: Hyundai Motor to convert Canadian plant HYUNDAI Motor of South Korea is to close its assembly line at Bromont, Quebec, for two years while it converts the underused plant to produce a new generation of its Elantra compact sedan. When it reopens in July 1995 the Bromont factory, which is Hyundai's only assembly plant outside South Korea, will export Elantras to Hyundai's fast-growing European markets, besides serving North America. Hyundai sold 110,000 cars in 13 European countries last year, making Europe its biggest export market. Mr John Wright, vice-president of Hyundai's Canadian subsidiary, said yesterday the Elantra had 'greater potential for future worldwide sales' than the mid-sized Sonata, which is now produced at Bromont. Production of Sonatas will be shifted to a factory in Ulsan, South Korea. The conversion of the Bromont plant is expected to cost CDollars 66.1m (Pounds 34m), with full production of 100,000 vehicles a year targeted for 1997. The company is negotiating a financial assistance package from the Canadian and Quebec governments. The Bromont factory has been running far below capacity since it was built in the late 1980s. The original plan was that the plant would capitalise on explosive demand for Hyundai cars in North America when they were introduced in Canada in 1984 and in the US two years later. Combined sales in the two countries reached a peak of 314,300 in 1987, when the sub-compact Pony was Canada's best-selling imported car. But buyers' enthusiasm for the low prices of Hyundai models gave way to disappointment at their poor quality. Sales tumbled further during the recession, and totalled 49,600 in the first five months of this year. The Bromont plant now has an annual capacity of 100,000 units, but turned out only 14,700 Sonatas last year.</p>

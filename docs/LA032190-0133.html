			<p><P> March 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICES LEAP 0.5%; WEATHER FLUCTUATIONS CITED  </P> <P> Consumer prices jumped 0.5% in February as retailers introduced higher-priced  spring and summer clothes earlier than usual because of warm winter weather in  much of the country, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.  </P> <P> Energy prices, which fueled a 1.1% surge in January's consumer price index,  dipped somewhat last month in another reflection of the unusually mild weather  patterns. Food prices, however, continued to rise in February.  </P> <P> Economists, viewing the recent ups and downs as the consequence of a warm  January and February following a record cold December, have not altered their  consensus: Inflation is still running at an annual rate of 4.5% to 5%.  </P> <P> "Weather was the distorting factor here," said Irwin L. Kellner, chief  economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. "The warm January and February  made people all over the country want to dress like Californians, so there was  a clamor for spring and summer clothes and the lines were brought up a month or  two early."  </P> <P> Bureau of Labor Statistics analysts estimated that fully 40% of February's  advance in retail prices was caused by a 3.3% jump in apparel prices.  </P> <P> Although government statisticians normally adjust their numbers to account for  such events as the introduction of new product lines, February's clothing price  hikes were subject to no seasonal adjustments because fashion introductions  normally occur in March or April.  </P> <P> "That 3.3% increase could not be corrected by the normal seasonal adjustments,  and that kind of increase is unlikely to continue," Kellner noted.  </P> <P> Energy costs, which jumped 5.1% in January as buyers rushed to replenish oil  and gasoline inventories depleted by December's record cold snap, dipped 0.7%  in February, the Labor Department reported.  </P> <P> But food prices, which gained 1.8% in January, advanced another 0.5% last  month. Both increases reflected big jumps in the price of freeze-damaged fresh  fruit and vegetables, which rose 10.2% in January and another 0.9% in February.  </P> <P> Excluding the volatile food and energy elements, the "core" inflation rate in  February was 0.5%, the same as the overall rate. In January, core inflation was  0.6%, considerably below the energy-distorted overall rate.  </P> <P> Before seasonal adjustment, consumer prices in the Los Angeles-Long  Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area rose a steep 1%, compared to 0.4% nationwide.  </P> <P> CONSUMER PRICE INDEX  </P> <P> Percent change from prior month  </P> <P> Feb. '90 +0.5%  </P> <P> Jan. '90 +1.1%  </P> <P> Feb. '89 +0.4%  </P> <P> Source: Labor Department  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jacques Bihozagara, RPF political bureau </F> member, by correspondent Quentin Dickinson in Brussels; date not  given--recorded]    [Text] Our interview this evening is with Jacques  Bihozagara, member of the Rwandan Patriotic Front [RPF]  political bureau and deputy prime minister of the government  according to the Arusha agreement. Mr. Bihozagara was expected  in Paris this morning for talks with French officials, but in  the end he declined the invitation. Quentin Dickinson met him  in Brussels. He asked him first of all about his feelings, his  assessment of the statement issued by the OAU this evening  opposing French humanitarian intervention in Rwanda. Listen to  Jacques Bihozagara:    [Bihozagara] We believe that the OAU, as an international  institution which was closely involved with the Arusha talks,  which ended in the signing of the Arusha peace agreement, has  reacted properly in speaking out against French intervention,  which in fact goes against the Arusha agreement, and also the UN  resolution.    [Dickinson] Does this decision by the OAU come as a surprise  to you?    [Bihozagara] Listen, it is not surprising, and we believe  that the OAU has always defended the Arusha agreement against  those who in fact wanted to (?upset things).    [Dickinson] You were due to go to Paris to meet the  cooperation minister, Michel Roussin, and Madame Michaux-Chevry:  Why did you not go?    [Bihozagara] I believe that this is a misleading report,  because in fact France was ready to receive me in Paris, but it  was not a meeting with the people whom you have just mentioned,  so that is why I did not go.    [Dickinson] So, who you were due to see?    [Bihozagara] Listen, you know that the Rwandan problem at  present requires in-depth analysis by political decision-makers  and I believe that if one has to go to Paris one has to see the  people who have the Rwandan question among their areas of  responsibility.    [Dickinson] The Rwandan question is part of the cooperation  minister's brief, though.    [Bihozagara] However, the cooperation minister was not  mentioned as being one of the people that I was due to meet.    [Dickinson] You would have met him though, if you were  invited.    [Bihozagara] As far as I know we have always met the French  authorities -- even last year, when I was the RPF's official in  Europe with responsibility for foreign policy -- so there is no  reason why we do not meet the French authorities if this can  bring about understanding.    [Dickinson] You know that the European public are quite  shocked by the massacres in your country, so how do you answer  the people here who say we have the impression that for you  putting an end to the massacres is, in a way, a secondary matter  compared with the military victory which you are expecting?    [Bihozagara] We believe that the RPF was the party most  greatly concerned about stopping the massacres, and the RPF went  into action on 7 April after the death of President Habyarimana  when all the international communities had pulled out of Rwanda  [as heard], so I believe that if there are people who are  changing their opinion now it is not because of this  international community or France, but it is due to the  intervention of the RPF, which has been able to save various  people without distinction from the assault by the militias and  extremists of the Rwandan army.    [Dickinson] Do you not think that by the same token French  intervention or international intervention would make it  possible to save lives?    [Bihozagara] I believe we have spoken out in favor of  international intervention, but we do not welcome French  intervention, for the reasons which we have outlined, because  France has been too heavily involved in Rwanda's affairs.</p>

			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: JAZZ / DIRK SUTRO: 'LIGHT' JAZZ HAS FOUND A HEFTY MARKET  IN S.D.  </P> <P> Exact demographics for the San Diego market may not be their strong point, but  the people at GRP, perhaps the leading "light" jazz label, know they've got a  major market here.  </P> <P> "San Diego's always been considered a good jazz town because of KIFM and the  promoters -- the shows they do at places like Humphrey's and the Bacchanal,"  said Mark Wexler, head of marketing for the New York record label that was  founded by Dave Grusin and Larry Rosen.  </P> <P> Even though Wexler labeled San Diego a small town and pegged the area's  population at "about 750,000" (it's well over 2 million), he had a better idea  of just how well his company's records -- by artists such as Lee Ritenour,  Grusin, Chick Corea, David Benoit and Tom Scott -- are doing.  </P> <P> Wexler couldn't supply figures for San Diego alone, but said sales here account  for a significant portion of the label's Southern California sales, which  totaled more than $3 million last year.  </P> <P> Tower Records on Sports Arena Boulevard, the largest record store in the  county, with sales of $500,000 a month, can attest to GRP's strength here.  </P> <P> "It's a very good market," said Danny Birch, assistant manager at the store.  "There are two radio stations in town that play commercial jazz. You don't find  that in other cities. They've always done well, even when they were  independent."  </P> <P> GRP signed a distribution agreement with MCA a couple of years ago that puts  its albums in nearly every major record store in the country. Birch said a top  GRP artist such as keyboard man David Benoit might sell 300 to 400 albums at  the Sports Arena Tower store alone. By comparison, straight jazz artists are  lucky to sell half-a-dozen copies.  </P> <P> Those who enjoy echoic sax riffs a la David Sanborn or the Chinese water  torture of drum machines will want to check out saxophonist Gerald Albright's  8:30 p.m. appearance March 8 at the Bacchanal.  </P> <P> Albright is a versatile talent. Immediately after college, he toured with  keyboard player Patrice Rushen, first on sax, later on bass. Unfortunately,  there's only one track from his new self-produced "Bermuda Nights," where his  playing takes precedence over the electronic Jacuzzi jazz fog. On the  composition "Too Cool," his smooth, sexy playing, reminiscent of Grover  Washington Jr.'s, is perfectly set off by the lyrical work of Bobby Lyle on  acoustic piano.  </P> <P> Undoubtedly, the album is headed for commercial success, having already sold  120,000 copies. Albright acknowledges his desire to make music that appeals to  a wide audience. Pressed, he even admits being a victim of the corporate  marketing machine at Atlantic Records, his label.  </P> <P> "A lot has to go into the way the record company likes to market me," Albright  said. "There's a fine line between how they'd like to market me and how I'd  like to be marketed. My music touches the technical, electronic side, and the  beat. Record companies subconsciously think you've got to have some kind of  beat to promote sales. Between those two elements, we arrived at the type of  music that I'm doing, and I feel real comfortable doing it."  </P> <P> For a more challenging evening, consider hearing free-form reed master Vinny  Golia on Monday night at Jazz Mine Records and CDs in La Jolla. Golia has  recorded with New York free jazz tenor sax man Tim Berne and with pianist Wayne  Peet and bassist Ken Filiano, who will form part of a quintet for the Jazz Mine  date. His new album, "Worldwide and Portable," is one of about a dozen he's  made as a leader.  </P> <P> Tierrasanta producer and musician John Archer placed his name among rarefied  company on Grammy night last week. Archer and Ronn Satterfield are the players  behind the local band Checkfield. Both are fluent on guitar, piano, vocals and  synthesizers, and they play a majority of the instruments on Checkfield's new  11-song album, "Through the Lens."  </P> <P> Some call the music, with its thick, studio-produced textures, "New Age."  Recorded at Network Productions in Rancho Bernardo, where Archer works as a  producer, the album is receiving local radio play and selling well in such  cities as San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis and Chicago.  </P> <P> But it was Archer's work at the control board that got the Grammy nomination,  not the music. Along with albums by Doc Severinsen, Stevie Winwood, Glenn Frey,  Little Feat and Scritti Politti, Checkfield's album was up for best  engineering.  </P> <P> "We paid very careful attention to the blends between the acoustic and  synthesized instruments," Archer said, explaining why he thinks the recording  was a contender. "Most people would be hard-pressed to tell what's acoustic and  what's synthesized."  </P> <P> Despite Archer's seamless production, the Grammy people gave the engineering  award to singer Winwood's "Roll With It."  </P> <P> SHORT RIFFS: The last of the Athenaeum's five-part jazz history lecture series  starts at 7 p.m. Monday. San Diego Union music critic George Varga will talk  about jazz and its many mutations in the 1970s and '80s. . . . By the way, the  Athenaeum has been adding to its jazz collection -- on tape, CD and vinyl --  and a $35 membership provides you access to the whole works. A librarian at the  La Jolla cultural center has about 1,000 jazz recordings, including 500  records, more than 200 tapes and 200 CDs. There's a five-album limit per  checkout. . . . Guitarist Joe D'Orio opens three nights at Diego's Loft  tonight. . . . Pianist Jimmy Corsaro and singer Sharon Andrews play Wednesday  through Saturday nights at The Library on Mission Gorge Road, a piano lounge in  the form of two living rooms filled with books.  </P></p>

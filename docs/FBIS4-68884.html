			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nina Zhukova and Georgiy Ostapkovich: "Business </F> Activity of Commercial Banks in Russia"]    [Text] The Center for Economic Conditions of the Russian  Federation Government has conducted its regular survey of the  business activity of Russian commercial banks for the second  half of 1993 and their intentions for the first half of 1994.  Some 82 commercial banks of Russia participated in the survey.  These include 22 small banks (with authorized fund of up to R200  million), or 27 percent of the total number of banks surveyed;  20 mid-size banks (with authorized fund from R201 to R500  million), or 24 percent; 14 large (with authorized fund from  R501 million to R1 billion), or 17 percent; and 26 major banks  (with authorized fund over R1 billion), or 32 percent of the  total number of banks surveyed.    It must be noted that the time frame for conduct of the  survey coincided with publication of the decision of the Russian  Federation Central Bank to increase, effective 1 March of this  year, the minimum authorized capital for newly registered  commercial banks from R100 million to R2 billion, and bring the  authorized fund of banks to 5 million ECU prior to 1999. The new  rules reflect an objective orientation on the part of the  Central Bank to effect the establishment in Russia of fairly  large and stable commercial institutions with a developed branch  network. In spite of the fact that presently existing small  banks are capable of operating relatively comfortably for  another five years, the results of this survey show a definite  pessimism on the part of the directors of small banks with  respect to their future prospects. The assessment of changes in  the many indices characterizing the activity of these banks up  through the end of the current half-year period is worse than  the actual situation that has taken shape for the second half of  1993.  <H5>  Overall Results </H5>   Bank directors predict development of the situation in  Russia's monetary and credit market in the first half of 1994 as  follows:    --two-thirds do not expect a worsening of the financial and  economic situation in the banking system as a whole, including  35 percent who are hoping for an improvement;    --60 percent report a possible strengthening of the  financial  and economic situation of their banks;    --eight out of 10 respondents expect increased profits;    --almost 90 percent predict an increase in their bank  reserves;    --about 75 percent of the bank directors do not intend to  reduce the share of total volume of attracted capital that  consists of interbank credits, and 44 percent expect this to  increase;    --virtually no bank intends to reduce its staff, and 65  percent are planning on augmenting this;    --only one bank out of 10 expects an improvement in the  financial and economic situation of its state enterprise clients;    --only 20 percent of the banks propose to expand their  deposit base by virtue of state enterprises;    --68 percent of bank directors do not expect a deterioration  in the financial and economic situation of commercial structures  being provided services, and more than a third predict  improvement here;    --virtually no one is planning on reducing the affording of  credits to commercial structures, and 82 percent of respondents  expect this will be increased;    --more than half state the possibility of expanded  investments by commercial structures;    --88 percent predict a growth in their number of clients  among the populace;    --90 percent of the directors intend to expand the deposit  base of their banks through deposits by physical persons;    --eight out of 10 intend to engage in short-term loan  transactions, and only 16 percent--in long-term credits.  <H5>  The Financial and Economic Situation of Banks and the </H5> Banking System in General    As in previous periods, the majority of respondents noted no  deterioration of the financial and economic state of the banking  system on the whole in the second half of 1993. Some 70 percent  stated there was in fact an improvement, and only 10 percent--a  deterioration in the situation at their banks. According to  predictions, the favorable situation in their activity will be  maintained in the first half of 1994 (60 percent and 9 percent,  respectively).    Directors of the major banks turned out to be more  optimistic  than the others. More than 75 percent reported an improvement,  and less than 8 percent--a deterioration of the financial and  economic situation of their banks in the second half of 1993.  The most unfavorable situation was seen with respect to the  small banks--63 percent and 14 percent of respondents,  respectively. If we compare actual and predicted assessments,  the latter were more pessimistic in the eyes of directors of all  bank categories. In this regard, the smaller the banks, the less  frequently their directors provided positive forecasts with  respect to the current year. Thus, 81 percent of respondents  from the major banks, 64 percent of those from the large banks,  and 55 percent of those representing mid-size banks expected an  improvement in the financial and economic state of their  institutions (virtually no one predicted a deterioration). For  the small banks, this index dropped to 37 percent (27 percent of  the respondents expect a deterioration of the situation).  Analysis shows the same kind of direct dependence linking the  size of the banks with their expected profit.    As far as the state of the banking system on the whole is  concerned, the most pessimistic assessments of both the actual  second half of 1993 and the predicted first half of 1994 were  expressed by the directors of small banks. Respondents from the  mid-size banks were the most optimistic here.  <H5>  Bank Clients and Their Financial and Economic Situation </H5>   The survey showed that the trend towards active enlistment  by  banks of physical persons and commercial structures as clients  was maintained in the second half of 1993. In both instances  about 90 percent of all those surveyed indicated an expansion,  and practically no one--a reduction in the numbers of clients in  these categories. Respondents make a similar prediction with  respect to the beginning of 1994.    The overall reduction in bank clients comprising state  enterprises continues. Respondents reported increases in the  number of such enterprises as clients of their banks only half  as often as they reported decreases (17 as opposed to 34  percent). Approximately the same distribution of assessments is  expected for the first half of 1994.    On the whole, respondents assessed positively the change in  financial and economic state of their clients comprising  physical persons. Over half believed this situation improved;  only one out of 10--that it worsened. According to predictions,  the corresponding figures for the first half of 1994 are 48 and  15 percent. The opinion of the bankers regarding the past and  present state of commercial structures is entirely ambiguous--in  both instances, each possible response (improved, worsened, did  not change) was indicated by about a third of the respondents.  For comparison purposes, we note that in the beginning of 1993  more than half the respondents believed the financial and  economic situation of businessmen had become more favorable. The  bank directors provided an appreciably worse assessment of the  situation of state enterprises than they did during the previous  period--60 percent note a deterioration and just 7 percent--an  improvement in the second half of 1993. For the first half of  1994, 51 and 10 percent, respectively, of respondents predict  such change.  <H5>  Attracted Capital </H5>   As in the beginning of 1993, two-thirds of bankers reported  an increase, and less than 10 percent--a decrease, in the  deposits of commercial structures in the second half of 1993. In  this regard, only just over half predict that such deposits will  increase during the current period (4 percent predict a  decrease).    Directors of the mid-size banks reported an increase in the  deposits of commercial structures significantly more frequently  than the others--nine out of 10 so responded. Mid-size banks  intend to a greater degree than the other categories to attract  deposits of the nonstate sector of the economy in the first half  of 1994.    In the second half of 1993, banks appreciably intensified  their activity, as compared with previous periods, with respect  to expansion of their resource base by attracting capital of the  populace. More than 90 percent of respondents noted an increase,  and virtually no one--a reduction. A similarly high degree of  activity by banks among the populace in general is predicted for  the current half year as well.    This trend, noted over the course of all surveys, shows that  the absolute monopoly of Sberbank [Savings Bank] over deposits  by the populace is gradually weakening. This is explained by the  more flexible interest rate policy and broader range of services  offered by commercial banks as compared with Sberbank.    Judging from the survey results, a reduction was seen in the  second half of 1993 in the share of banks increasing their  attracted capital by virtue of the deposits of state  enterprises. Some 37 percent of respondents indicated a  reduction, and only one-fourth--an increase in such  contributions. The large banks clearly led in this respect (65  and 21 percent of respondents, respectively). A further  reduction of the deposits of state enterprises is expected in  the first half of 1994. Here only the mid-size banks are  "falling out" of this trend. In evaluating the past and current  periods, more than a third of their directors note an increase,  and only 20 percent--a reduction, in the contributions of these  enterprises.    A high dependence by surveyed banks on the market of  interbank credits was observed over the course of all surveys.  Approximately two-thirds of respondents regularly reported the  expansion, and only about 15 percent--the reduction, of such  credits. Mid-size bank respondents reported more frequently than  other categories about increases and less frequently about  decreases in the securing of interbank loans during the last  half of 1993. For the current half year, however, it will  apparently be the large and major banks that will be most active  in the interbank credits market.    The interest rates of commercial banks on deposits continued  to rise during the second half of 1993. Nine out of 10 directors  reported an increase (and one out of 10--no change). Predicting  the situation for the first half of 1994, 80 percent of  respondents indicated such an increase. The interest rates of  small banks increased to a lesser degree than those of other  bank categories. The rise in interest rates of the large and  major banks will decelerate over the current half year,  according to the survey.  <H5>  Credit Policy </H5>   No significant changes took place in the second half of 1993  in the credit portfolio of commercial banks, and no changes are  expected in the first half of 1994. As before, commercial  structures remain the main borrowers from banks. About 87  percent of respondents reported an increase in loans afforded  these structures over the past half-year period, and 82 percent  expect an increase during the current period (in both instances  virtually no one indicated a decrease).    According to the survey data, major banks displayed the  greatest activity in affording credits to commercial structures.  None of these reduced, and 92 percent increased their extension  of credits to these clients during the second half of 1993.  During the first half of 1994, all the major banks are planning  on increasing their credits. Major banks have also expanded and  will continue to expand the amounts of hard currency afforded  commercial structures to a greater degree than other categories  of banks.    Despite the worsening of the financial situation of state  enterprises noted by respondents, banks have continued to  increase the credits afforded these structures, though in  smaller amounts. In the second half of 1993, less than half (44  percent) the respondents reported increases here, and almost 30  percent--decreases in loans allocated to the state sector.    It is expected that during the first half of 1994, the  number  of respondents indicating increases will again go down (to 37  percent), and the number indicating decreases will remain at its  prior level. In this regard, about 60 percent of banks did not  lend hard currency to state enterprises. About 15 percent  expanded, and 7 percent reduced their extension of hard currency  credits during the second half of 1993. It is expected that the  gap between these two indices will narrow during this half-year  period, also that the major banks will be the most active bank  category with respect to extending credits to state enterprises  in the first half of 1994. This includes hard currency  transactions as well.    Commercial banks significantly augmented the scale on which  they provide services to the populace during the second half of  1993, as compared with the previous period. Some 45 percent of  respondents reported an increase here, and only 9 percent--a  decrease in loans extended to physical persons. For the current  half-year period, these figures are 40 and 11 percent,  respectively. Mid-size banks, as well as the major banks,  expanded their provision of credits to the populace to a greater  extent than other bank categories. According to predictions,  mid-size banks will maintain a high degree of activity during  the current half year. The large banks will join them.    Over the course of all the surveys, a stable 12 percent of  respondents reported diminished extension of credits to other  banks. The proportion of respondents noting an increase rose  steadily, however. This percentage reached 27 percent during the  past half year, and is expected to reach 32 percent during the  current period.    Not a single bank reduced its rates on credits extended  during the second half of 1993, and 93 percent increased these  rates. Judging from the responses of bank directors, a certain  stabilization around the level of the second half of 1993 is  expected for the current half year with respect to the cost of  obtaining credit. Over 20 percent of the respondents so  indicated. Apparently, the real reduction in the rate of  inflation seen in recent months enables us even now to evaluate  the current rates as favorable.    The directors of small banks responded more frequently than  those of other bank categories regarding the possibility of  maintaining interest rates at their previous level. In addition  to the above-mentioned factor, the fact that many small banks  are greatly dependent upon their founders also exerts an  influence on such expectations. Under the present circumstances  they are often compelled to extend credits to their founders at  lowered interest rates.  <H5>  Priorities and Main Orientations of Credit Policy </H5>   During the second half of 1993, as before, short-term loans  remained a priority in the structure of credits, almost 90  percent of the respondents reporting increases in this regard,  and just 1 percent--reductions. The figures with respect to  long-term credits were 16 and 34 percent, respectively, i.e.,  the scale of provision of investment credits diminished even  more. In this regard, judging from the distribution of  respondent replies, about 30 percent of the banks did not extend  long-term credits at all. The intensity of expansion of  short-term credits will apparently decrease somewhat during the  current half year, while the reduction in extension of long-term  credits will continue at approximately the same level. In this  regard, whereas fewer than one-fourth of the banks maintained  the level of such credits unchanged during the second half of  1993, this number is expected to be over 30 percent in the first  half year of 1994, according to predictions.    At the same time, the survey results show that a rather  significant group of commercial banks operating in Russia's  monetary and credit market do not foresee a reduction in  long-term credits in the first half of 1994. These comprise  primarily the small (46 percent) and large (50 percent) banks.  Whereas most of the small, "pocket" banks will be engaged in  this activity by virtue of pressure founders exert on them, the  large banks can be viewed as potential credit institutions  prepared to engage in the financing of investment projects.    Clearly, the swiftest possible implementation of the main  provisions affixed in the March decree of the Russian Government  on financing and affording credits for capital construction in  the Russian Federation could greatly minimize the risk to banks  related to provision of long-term credits and could make this  type of banking activity more attractive.    The survey shows that banking structures intend to increase  their financial support to all sectors of the Russian Federation  economy during the first half of 1994. The scale on which this  support will be provided varies greatly, however. In the opinion  of the bankers, trade is the preferred sphere of future credit  investments. Two-thirds of all respondents predict an increase,  and only one out of every 10--a decrease in such investments.  About half of the respondents expect growth in credits extended  to industry and only 15 percent--a reduction. The situation with  respect to financial support for construction is noticeably  worse. One-third of the bankers intend to increase their  issuance of loans to this sector of the economy during the  current half year, while 17 percent intend to reduce it.  Investments in the infrastructure will increase to a lesser  extent than investments in other spheres.    Large banks will expand their issuance of loans to the  sphere  of trade on a significantly larger scale than other bank  categories, as stated by 86 percent of the large bank directors  (none indicated any reduction in these loans). Credits afforded  this sector of the economy by mid-size banks will increase more  intensively than the sampling average.    Large banks intend to increase their financial support to  industry to a greater degree than the others. About 65 percent  of their directors reported a growth in extension of industrial  credits, and just 7 percent--a decrease. Small banks are  expected to show a low degree of activity. However, small banks  lead the way in affording loans to agriculture. Their directors  predicted growth of these loans more often (one out of two), and  diminution less (14 percent). The major banks also intend to  increase credits to agriculture, while mid-size and large banks  intend to reduce them.    As far as the construction sphere is concerned, the  following  rule applies. The larger the bank, the greater the scale on  which investments in it will increase.    Mid-size banks intend to support the infrastructure most  actively. Their directors reported possible increases  significantly more frequently than others (40 percent), and  reductions--less frequently (5 percent) in the issuance of loans  to this sphere.    It should be noted in conclusion that, on the whole, the  predicted and actual assessments of bank credit policy in the  second half of 1993 coincided. In this regard, bankers were  somewhat more optimistic in predicting expansion of their  clientele than in afterwards asserting the reality, while they  were more pessimistic in assessing the future scale of expansion  of attracted capital.   <FIG ID=JPRS-USR-056-09A>      Figure 1.

			<p>941205 FT  05 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: Insolvency options There have long been complaints that Britain's banks are too ready to shut down insolvent businesses. One reason is that banks have first call on a company's assets, so liquidation may suit them even if it does not maximise a firm's value. Trade creditors and shareholders may do better by keeping the firm going but are unable to insist on it. In last week's Budget, the chancellor promised action to prevent firms going needlessly to the wall. In particular, he is considering an ingenious method proposed by three economists for resolving the conflict between different classes of claimant. In the simple case, when there are only banks and shareholders, the scheme works as follows: the banks receive all the insolvent company's shares; but each shareholder has the option to buy back his shares by paying the banks an equivalent proportion of what they are owed. According to the economists, the scheme is in the interest of banks, as they either end up owning the company or receive their money. It benefits shareholders, as they can buy out the banks if they think the firm is worth more than its debts. It should also prevent needless liquidation, as whoever ends up owning the firm will only wind it up if that is the best way of maximising value. The main criticism is that the scheme becomes unworkable when multiple classes of creditor are introduced. In particular, small trade creditors may not have the expertise to decide whether to exercise their options to buy out the banks. The economists have an answer to this criticism: why not have a market in the options? Specialist investors who do have the necessary expertise would then be able to buy up the options of small creditors. Some think the whole idea is too clever by half. But it is actually not terribly different from trading in nil-paid rights.</p>

			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Spain cautious on interest rates The Bank of Spain yesterday followed up a quarter-point cut in its daily intervention rate at the end of last week by lowering its benchmark rate from 8.75 per cent to 8.50 per cent at its 10 day repurchase tender for central bank certificates. The move disappointed some analysts who had hoped for a half-point cut but it reflected caution by the authorities after higher than expected price increases in January which put annualised inflation at 5 per cent. Markets still expect the benchmark rate to be down to around 7 per cent by the end of the year. Italy's industrial output fell 2.8 per cent last year against a 0.6 per cent fall in 1992. Output fell in the first three quarters, but rose 0.2 per cent in the final quarter. Dutch consumer spending rose 0.4 per cent year-on-year in volume in the fourth quarter of 1993, and by 0.8 per cent over the whole year, against a rise of 2.1 per cent in 1992. French household spending on manufactured goods was up 1.4 per in January this year over last year. In December, 1993, consumer spending was 3.9 per cent below December 1992.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov] </F>   [Text] Murmansk, 14 Mar -- Two of the four generating sets  at the Kola nuclear power station were shut down today because  of various faults. A routine shutdown of another reactor is  planned for 22 March.    Bearing in mind that the station provides more than 60  percent of all the electricity generated in Murmansk Oblast, it  is not difficult to imagine the consequences. It is not only  enterprises on the Kola Peninsula that will suffer. In the  first place, "supplies of electricity to neighboring Karelia and  Leningrad Oblast will be halted," Vitaliy Meshkov, general  director of the Kola power system said today at a meeting with  the head of the oblast administration.    Apart from purely technical faults, the work of Europe's  northernmost nuclear power station has been affected by debts  owed by consumers, including some in neighboring Karelia. The  shortage of resources is preventing power engineers at the Kola  station from carrying out maintenance work on time and  recharging the reactors with nuclear fuel according to schedule.  Although top Moscow ministry officials and the Russian  Government know about the disastrous situation at the nuclear  power station, the power engineers are not receiving any help  from them. In addition, because of unprecedented customs  tariffs, they cannot even obtain equipment provided as aid by  firms in Scandinavian countries to ensure the safe operation of  the nuclear power station.    In view of the critical situation, senior officials from the  station and the Kola grid will fly to Moscow tomorrow, in order  to inform the head of government of this personally and to ask  him to adopt measures.</p>

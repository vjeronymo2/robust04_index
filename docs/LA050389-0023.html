			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DONATIONS TO PICUS, WOO PROBED;  </P> <P> DEVELOPERS MAY HAVE VIOLATED $500-PER-PERSON LIMIT  </P> <P> Investigators are looking into multiple developer contributions accepted by  recently reelected City Council members Joy Picus and Mike Woo as possible  violations of Los Angeles' strict $500-per-person limit on campaign  contributions, city officials said Tuesday.  </P> <P> Since voters passed the campaign limit in 1985, there have been repeated  accusations that candidates and contributors seek to circumvent the law through  various strategies.  </P> <P> City Clerk Elias Martinez confirmed Tuesday that his office is probing both  Picus' and Woo's campaign statements at the request of the city attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Although Martinez would give no details, Woo campaign manager Steve Afriat said  the investigation centers on fourteen $500 contributions accepted by the  councilman from seven executives of the Lycon Group, a development firm, and  their children.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Contributions Returned  </P> <P> "We returned half of the contributions, those from the children, because they  seemed to go against the law, because the money actually appeared to come from  the parents," Afriat said.  </P> <P> "But Mike didn't catch it right away, so the returns didn't show up on our last  campaign statement in late March. So I guess someone complained."  </P> <P> He expressed confidence that investigators would drop the case once they  examine the canceled checks by which the seven contributions from children of  executives were returned.  </P> <P> The Picus probe stems from a letter sent to City Atty. James Hahn by Paul  McKellips, one of five candidates Picus edged out in the April 11 primary.  </P> <P> McKellips said Tuesday that he urged investigators to look into $500  contributions to Picus from Sherman Oaks developer Edward L. Saunders, his  wife, and son Brad, who lives at the family home in Woodland Hills.  </P> <P> "When a child lives at home, it raises the question of whether he put up the  money or whether his parents did it using him as a figurehead," McKellips said.  </P> <P> "Brad is swimming in money," Anita Harkavy, an executive assistant at Saunders  Development Corp., said Tuesday. "He is very wealthy on his own without mom and  dad."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Enthusiastic Supporter'  </P> <P> She termed Brad Saunders, 22, an "enthusiastic supporter of Picus in his own  right."  </P> <P> Also questioned by McKellips were three $500 contributions from Selleck  Properties Inc., a Woodland Hills development firm.  </P> <P> Two of the checks were sent in the name of other firms with the same address --  Sherman Way-White Oak Associates and Tampa-Saticoy Associates.  </P> <P> Noting that the law also limits business entities to $500 each per candidate,  McKellips asked, "Are these really separate businesses? I think that should be  checked into."  </P> <P> Bob Selleck, managing general partner and brother of actor Tom Selleck, said  Tuesday he is convinced that the three firms, each of which is a different  partnership, "are separate under the law's definition. We thoroughly reviewed  that before making the contributions."  </P> <P> Sharon Schuster, Picus' chief deputy, said she had "no doubt" that  investigators would conclude that "we have followed the letter and spirit of  the law."  </P> <P> She said that in the recent campaign, Picus returned more than $30,000 in  contributions that exceeded the $500 limit, out of a total of $280,000 in  contributions.  </P></p>

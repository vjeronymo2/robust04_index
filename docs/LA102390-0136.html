			<p><P> October 23, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> RAMS JUMP ON OWN BANDWAGON AFTER WIN  </P> <P> One victory, one little leap to a 2-4 record and suddenly all is well again  with the Rams.  </P> <P> Last week, they were 1-4 and feeling at rock bottom.  </P> <P> "We couldn't even see the light of day two days ago," Coach John Robinson said.  </P> <P> But Monday, the Rams didn't need excuses, statistical examinations or an  embarrassed coach to explain their plight.  </P> <P> All they needed was to point to the NFC standings, accept the compliments for  the 44-24 pounding they had given the Atlanta Falcons Sunday and begin talking  about how their early-season emergencies are vanishing.  </P> <P> One victory, and the sinking feelings are history.  </P> <P> "I think we've crawled out of the hole and we're back in the race," Robinson  said. "I think there are a couple of guys way out in front of us, but  surprisingly, there are a number of people, when you think wild card, who are  not very far in front of us, who have yet to negotiate a couple of holes that  may be up there for them, too.  </P> <P> "If we can get going and really start to improve now, then I think we can make  this into a good season."  </P> <P> Only six NFC teams have better records than the Rams, and only three of those  -- the San Francisco 49ers, Chicago Bears and New York Giants -- seem  particularly uncatchable.  </P> <P> And, including the Rams, seven teams -- one-half of the conference -- have 2-4  records. Thanks to the addition of a third wild-card team this season, six  teams in each conference make the playoffs.  </P> <P> So even if it's more a matter of the rest of the conference falling back than  the Rams' rise into the playoff hunt, the Rams can dream of better days.  </P> <P> And the rest of the conference is courteously allowing them that luxury.  </P> <P> "I don't see much difference in teams in the NFL, with the clear exception of  those that you would put at the top," Robinson said. "There's a lot that  happens from now. I think things begin to take shape, teams begin to settle  into oblivion and others begin to try to stay in the hunt for whatever playoff  opportunities they have.  </P> <P> "Go down the NFC list. Who's going to be good? Damned if I know. It's the club  that seems to come alive now that has a chance to do it.  </P> <P> "We've done this before. We've had down periods and have come back strong from  them. We hope we can do it again."  </P> <P> If anything, the Rams hope the last month of trauma has made them stronger,  tighter as a unit and ready for the long road ahead.  </P> <P> And after Sunday's solid defensive performance against a wide-open Atlanta  offense that would have seemed designed to plunder the Rams' previously weak  pass defense, they were convinced the tough times are through.  </P> <P> "This team has been through a lot the last six games, and we're going to be a  better team for it," quarterback Jim Everett said. "I think this is going to be  a turning point, after all we've gone through."  </P> <P> Said Robinson: "I guess if you survive a beating it makes you stronger. I don't  know whether that's masochistic or not. I think we did all of this staying  together. I think there's a certain sense of pride in that.  </P> <P> "In the course of the last month, a couple of coaches have been attacked in  terms of not doing their job, of being in jeopardy of losing their jobs. Those  are all difficult things to deal with. I think we all dealt with it OK."  </P> <P> The man who had to deal with the most negative attention was defensive  coordinator Fritz Shurmur, who said the last thing he wanted was for the  players to begin worrying about his job security.  </P> <P> When the point was raised publicly last week, Shurmur said he went to his  players and told them to ignore the talk and concentrate on winning, not saving  his job.  </P> <P> The result was a quality defensive effort, one that Shurmur thinks was more  about personal pride than coaching survival.  </P> <P> "All I did was say that, 'Hey, let's not any of us get so involved with this  job situation thing that it's a factor,' " Shurmur said. "Because my job is not  the issue. The issue is we as a group of people getting ready to play.  </P> <P> </P> <P> RAMS NUMBERS  </P> <P> HIGHLIGHT: HENRY ELLARD  </P> <P> Sunday was just another day for one of the NFL's premier receivers -- six  catches for 109 yards and one touchdown. On one reception -- late in the second  period -- he fully extended himself to make a leaping 26-yard catch of a Jim  Everett pass; on another, with 3:45 gone in the third quarter, he left a  stunned Delon Sanders frozen at the Falcons' 10-yard line where he had cut to  the left sideline. The Fesno State grad then cut back to the inside and was all  alone to take Everett's reception, Ellard eclipsed Elroy Hirsch's 33-year-old  Ram record (6,289 yards) for career receiving yardage. Ellard's total stands at  6,312 for his seven-plus years pro career.  </P> <P> SEASON TO DATE  </P> <P>  Six-game totals  </P> <P>  FIRST DOWNS  </P> <P> RAMS: 122  </P> <P> OPP: 117  </P> <P> RUSHING

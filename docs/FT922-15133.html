			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / Arts: Edinburgh Festival There are four themes running through this year's Edinburgh Festival, the first under the stewardship of Brian McMaster, formerly controller of the Welsh National Opera. The most obvious is the music of Tchaikovsky. A retrospective embraces 30 events. The highlights are a concert performance of his rarely staged opera The Oprichnik, by Scottish Opera on August 20; his Cantata Moscow on September 3; and a re-creation of his original opera and ballet double-bill Yolanta and The Nutcracker from August 26-29. Another theme is a series of five concerts featuring music by Scottish composers, including the Scottish premiere of James McMillan's Percussion Concerto performed by Evelyn Glennie. Drama includes retrospectives devoted to Harley Granville Barker, including his three major works, The Voysey Inheritance, The Madras House and His Majesty, and to the Glasgow-born playwright C. P. Taylor. The National Theatre brings Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna. Details from Festival Office, 21 Market Street, Edinburgh EH1 1BW (Tel: 031 226 4001).</p>

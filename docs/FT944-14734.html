			<p>941021 FT  21 OCT 94 / The Lex Column: Chase Manhattan Mr Art Ryan, leaving Chase Manhattan to run Prudential Insurance of the US, has timed his move well. The US banking cycle is probably at its peak, with the easy profit gains behind it. Chase's shareholders have benefited from the partnership between Mr Ryan and his boss, Mr Tom Labrecque; they may now have cause to worry that the single-minded focus on profitability, Mr Ryan's gift to Chase in recent years, may be diluted just as the bank needs to find ways of replacing the easy ride on the yield curve.</p>

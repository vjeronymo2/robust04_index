			<p>920515 FT  15 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Grand Metropolitan Initial excitement at Grand Metropolitan's interim figures proved short-lived yesterday. Though the 7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits was above best expectations, a large part of the gain was thanks to currency movements. Organic growth in the continuing businesses was only 2 per cent. And while the interest charge was cut by 42 per cent compared with the same period of 1990-91, net borrowings have actually increased slightly since September. The market's second thoughts may nevertheless have been overdone. Organic growth would have been higher without the losses at Pearle, which will doubtless eventually be set on its feet and sold. The borrowing figure was inflated by both a seasonal rise in working capital and the fact that disposal proceeds of some Pounds 170m had not been received when the accounts were struck. There may be a wait before economic recovery is felt, but longer-term prospects make a rating just below the market average look grudging.</p>

The Jordanian leadership and people were not content only to  condemn and denounce the reprehensible crime, organize protest  demonstrations, explain its obnoxious hostile and provocative  designs, and outline the intentions of those behind it but  accompanied this with concrete practical measures denoting  maturity, wisdom, and deliberation. His Majesty King Husayn  donated 100,000 Jordanian dinars. The Government also donated  100,000 dinars. The Jordanian citizens donated goods and  medicines, as well as the blood needed for the wounded.    His Majesty King Husayn's reply was a national response  showing a high sense of responsibility, wisdom, and clarity of  vision. The king called on the Arab leaders to shoulder their  responsibilities, and to unite their ranks, actions, and stands.  He also called on them to forget their differences and rise  above the causes of dispute and estrangement. [passage omitted]    In any case, all the people and countries in the world and  all the international organizations and bodies, including the UN  Security Council and the United Nations, have come to realize  that it is impossible to achieve peace in the occupied  Palestinian territories with the presence of the settlements and  the Jewish settlers.    It has also been proved that the Arab citizens, the Islamic  holy places, and the Muslim and Christian places of worship  there need international protection. This requires the dispatch  of an international peacekeeping force to the occupied Gaza  Strip and the West Bank to protect their inhabitants and holy  places. The responsibility for the bloody dawn massacre at the  Ibrahimi Mosque is borne by Israel and by the United States  which encourages it to pursue its settlement policy. This  calls for a united Arab stand to confront all these momentous  challenges.</p>

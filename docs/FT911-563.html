			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Hurd calls for release of hostages BRITAIN'S relations with Iran will remain difficult as long as British hostages are held in Lebanon, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said yesterday. Mr Hurd also told the Scottish Conservative conference in Perth the government was determined to push ahead with its plan for a United Nations police force to protect Kurdish refugees in northern Iraq. He dismissed Baghdad's objections to the UN proposal and added that it was 'difficult to imagine' that the government of Mr Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, could fulfil all the conditions for the removal of sanctions. 'Only a new government will enable Iraq to be re-admitted to the community of nations,' he said. Mr Hurd's decision to focus on the three British hostages still held in Lebanon showed his concern to emphasise that the Foreign Office had not given up hope of securing their release. Britain looked to Iran to use its 'potentially decisive' influence to secure their release, Mr Hurd added. 'Relations between Britain and Iran have great potential, but will remain stunted for as long as Britons are held in Lebanon.' Diplomatic relations between London and Tehran were restored in 1990 after a two-year break. The two governments have not yet exchanged ambassadors, and Mr Hurd's comments yesterday suggested that Britain could not until the hostage issue was resolved. The foreign secretary said he was also demanding the re-lease of two Britons held in Iraqi jails.</p>

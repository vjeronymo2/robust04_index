			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Arts: The lottery - will it end in tears? / To some it could mean a golden age, to others extinction Next year cash from Britain's national lottery will start to feed through to help the arts and usher in a new cultural golden age. That is the scenario. The reality could be that the arrival of the lottery will signal the closure of many arts organisations in the UK, in particular those whose survival depends upon getting lottery money. If their bids are unsuccessful, they will see little point in struggling on. Almost daily, redevelopment plans are announced that are totally dependent on the lottery. This month alone in London the Riverside Studios launched a Pounds 3.3m appeal; the ENO a Pounds 40m-plus refurbishment programme; and the ICA a Pounds 25m drive next year. These are on top of the Royal Opera House and the British Museum, both of which are thinking big: Pounds 100m or so; the South Bank, with Pounds 65m; Albertopolis at Pounds 150m - and on and on. Some of these started out as millennium projects but they are already hedging their bets and winking at the Arts Council's lottery department, which is bracing itself to receive up to 30,000 applications when the floodgate opens on January 1. In theory, with predictions of Pounds 150m a year for the arts from the lottery at the start, rising to Pounds 320m, there will be plenty of money to spread around. In practice, too many arts companies will seek help immediately, and some will have their plans rejected. It might be better to delay an application for aid. One reason why the Arts Council lottery satraps will turn down a supplicant is that they do not believe in the feasibility of its development plan. In theory arts companies must find some matching money through their own efforts: from local authorities, business, and private philanthropists. At one time the government hoped for 50:50 deals but the likelihood of conjuring up Pounds 150m a year from friends of the arts is obviously nonsense. The Arts Council is already lowering its targets, to 35 per cent self-generated funds for large organisations, even less for smaller, but it would still be be remarkable if many arts companies could raise such sums. Many will fall at this hurdle. Where will the self-generated money come from? Business is the obvious answer, but companies will not want to scatter their funds around. Boards might choose to support just Covent Garden or the National Theatre's modest Pounds 4m appeal, or that of a local theatre or arts centre. There is also the real danger that if they do rally round the arts on these capital projects they will cut back on their sponsorship of performances, on backing a new opera production or concert tour. Rather belatedly, other companies are starting to realise that there must be money to be made from these vast new lottery expenditures. Accountants Moore Stephens has been quick off the mark in forming an arts and heritage group under Stephen Clarke which will advise arts companies on how they can best organise themselves to take advantage of lottery revenues. The Almeida, the Young Vic and Stratford East have been advised on their management and financial practices, and Moore Stephens is also helping the Lowry project in Lancashire come up with a business plan. The feeling is that the private sector will only help arts companies with substantially more money if there is some commercial advantage for them. The government is unlikely to offer tax breaks, so perhaps arts organisations themselves could come up with some profit-sharing schemes. The obvious example is brewers weighing in with cash for redevelopment in return for bar and catering concessions in refurbished buildings. Computer companies might also help if rewarded with the task of modernising the box office system. Foreign touring by an arts organisation could interest a corporate supporter keen to open up contacts in export markets. Alternatively, companies might be attracted by the idea of debentures (which famously got the Albert Hall built), or guarantees of free tickets for their workforces, or having the new building carry a company name (like the Toshiba link with the ICA announced this week), or space in the theatre or opera house set aside for corporate use. The new Pounds 42m Royal Armories in Leeds has attracted money from companies like 3i and Yorkshire Electricity which feel that the museum, and the surrounding commercial developments, could be profitable. No one imagines that the financial return from funding arts regeneration will be anywhere near usual business targets. But if directors and shareholders can convince themselves that they are getting something in return for their cash they might accept their wider responsibilities to the community and to the cultural life of the nation. One of Stephen Dorrell's first tasks as heritage minister will be to devise ways in which the private sector can be encouraged to invest in this great arts building boom. The alternative is for the guidelines to be ignored and the lottery cash go to the worthy and the unworthy in the form of almost 100 per cent re-building grants, plus the essential endowment funds. For when the splendid new buildings do emerge, the cost of staffing them, and filling them with plays, music, and art worthy of the setting, will have to come from somewhere. One thing already seems obvious: the larger organisations will have a head start over the smaller, not only because they are more commercially sophisticated but because they can call on more influential names to head their appeals. One of the incidental joys of the whole process will be to see how these grandees perform as fund-raisers. Will that scion of the great and the good, Sir Claus Moser, who heads the British Museum's ambitious Pounds 100m redevelopment plan (Princess Margaret is patron) steal a march over ex-Tory party money man Shaun Woodward, who is master-minding the ENO capital project and is married to a Sainsbury. Now is the time to nab your mover and shaker. It could all end in tears. There are some who do not believe that these vast new sums will emerge from thin air. What if the lottery is a disappointment and the British public sticks to gambling on the horses and the football pools? Last week, John Major nailed his colours to the lottery mast. If the lottery does not provide the anticipated cash, optimists expect the government to make it work with tax breaks or lavish endowment funding. Pessimists, however, fear that it might all end in tears.</p>

			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Regulating the Markets (Views from the UK and US): America's power to protect - The SEC chief really runs the show The strength and breadth of influence of the US Securities and Exchange Commission far exceed the Securities and Investments Board's in the UK. 'We have extraordinarily broad powers,' said Mr Richard Breeden, the hard-hitting SEC chairman. 'There is no question about who is the regulator and who is the regulatee in the American system.' The SEC, which is being closely studied in the review of the UK investments regulatory system, polices 6,000 broker-dealer firms and oversees 4,000-5,000 public offerings every year, as well as keeping an eye on the US's 3,800 mutual funds (unit trusts) holding Dollars 1,500bn of assets. It has authority in two areas outside the brief of the SIB: it vets all listings of securities, and is the main prosecutor for fraud and market manipulation. Its role as a prosecutor lies at the root of its effectiveness, according to Mr Breeden. 'If you don't have the power to prosecute, you are missing out the key ingredient,' he argued. A year ago, he fined Salomon Bros Dollars 290m (Pounds 178m) for breaching US Treasury bond auction rules. He commands an army of lawyers, analysts and examiners that is 2,600-strong  - an increase of 700 since he took office three years ago. Although the SEC cannot compete with the salaries paid by Wall Street law practices and securities firms  - Mr Breeden himself earns a relatively meagre Dollars 119,000  - it has attracted ambitious lawyers and analysts who regard a spell at the SEC as a good career move. These human resources are perceived as the regime's greatest asset, particularly in the enforcement division. 'Crooks don't put up a billboard and say: 'Come get me, I'm breaking the law.' They work very hard to conceal their activities,' said Mr Breeden. He believes that there are efficiencies to be gained from integrating the inspection, evaluation and prosecution functions. If inspectors discover a trading irregularity at a securities firm, 'we can be across the street in the courthouse in a single day', Mr Breeden boasted. 'No other agency has to be briefed, evidence doesn't have to be boxed up, and doesn't have to be copied for someone else.' Although less dependent on self-regulation than the UK, the US system does use self-regulatory organisations, such as the National Association of Securities Dealers, which oversee the running of their own markets. But Mr Breeden is not about to let anyone forget who runs the show. 'They cannot enact any rule binding on their members without our approval. Even on the question of what time the stock exchange opens and closes, we have the final say.' One important strength of the SEC, said Mr Breeden, is that it is relatively independent of market practitioners and is therefore less open to arm-twisting by the securities industry. Predictably, market participants complain that the SEC regime is excessively stringent and places US securities firms at a competitive disadvantage. They also charge it with being too bureaucratic. There are suggestions that its resources are sometimes misused or misdirected: for example, the rechecking of inspection visits by SROs is widely viewed as unnecessary. Mr Breeden, whose term ends in June, is also accused of being politically ambitious. He is probably closer to the White House than previous incumbents and counts President George Bush as a friend. Some market participants argue that his aggressive stance on some issues, such as capital requirements, is motivated by the desire to avoid the political embarrassment of a securities firm collapse. But Mr Breeden insists that his focus is the investor, not political approbation. 'Our prime objective is investor protection,' he said. 'The amount of money that can be gained from financial fraud in today's market is almost limitless. And the losses that can be imposed on the public are similarly great.'</p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / International Company News: Macy's files for protection under Chapter 11 R. H. Macy, one of America's largest department store chains, yesterday filed for protection against its creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code - the latest, and one of the largest, casualties of the leveraged buy-out mania of the 1980s. The company, which has one of the world's best retailing franchises, was taken private by its management in a Dollars 3.6bn buy-out in 1986, but it has struggled for years with a heavy debt burden, currently estimated at around Dollars 3.7bn. Recession in the US and poor sales during the crucial Christmas season delivered the final blow, reducing cashflow to the point where it could not pay its suppliers, who began to hold back merchandise shipments. Mr Edward Finkelstein, the chairman, who just weeks ago denied that a Chapter 11 filing was an option, said: 'We worked day and night to find a suitable solution, and ultimately came to the conclusion that filing for Chapter 11 was best for Macy's future. I am convinced that beginning this rehabilitative process is the best way to protect our valuable franchise.' Macy's is expected to follow the path of other retailing groups which have gone through Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reorganised their finances, and emerged essentially intact, albeit somewhat smaller, with control of the group handed over to senior creditors in return for debt relief. Before filing for Chapter 11, Macy's yesterday obtained a vital Dollars 600m debtor-in-possession financing commitment from Chemical Banking and Bankers Trust. These funds, which have priority in any debt repayment, will allow the company to meet the day-to-day financing needs of the business, including employee salaries and payment to suppliers. All Macy's 144 stores remained open yesterday and operating as usual. The company has 98 outlets using the Macy's name, mainly in the north-east US, the south and California. It also operates 29 Bullock's and 24 I. Magnin stores in California. The company bought the latter two chains in a misjudged acquisition in 1988 which added Dollars 1bn to its already heavy debt burden. Among the main losers from yesterday's filing will be the holders of Macy's equity, including its management; GE Capital, the financial services arm of the General Electric group; and Loews Corporation, the diversified company headed by Mr Laurence Tisch. A Dollars 1bn eleventh hour rescue attempt by Mr Tisch broke down on Friday night, prompting yesterday's bankruptcy filing. Other losers will include the holders of Macy's unsecured junk bonds, issued at the time of the buy-out, who will get back only a fraction of their investment.</p>

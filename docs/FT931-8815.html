			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Gummer called to account for pond MR John Gummer, the agriculture minister, was told yesterday by a Westminster committee to declare in the register of MPs' interests landscaping work on a garden pond in his garden. Following a complaint brought by Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, the cross-party committee of MPs interests reprimanded Mr Gummer, saying that he should have registered the Pounds 2,000-plus worth of work paid for by Hillsdown Holdings, the food group. The work was carried out in connection with an informal meeting of EC agriculture ministers in September last year, after Mr Gummer had allowed his Suffolk home to be used to entertain visiting ministers and stage an agricultural show. The programme was sponsored by 100 companies including Tesco and Allied-Lyons in order, Mr Gummer said, to ensure that there was no particular obligation to a single company. The report from the committee on MPs' interests emphasised the need for ministers to keep to the rules for MPs about gifts, and not to rely just on separate government rules. The MPs made the same point in their inquiry last month into the failure of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to declare an anonymous payment of some Pounds 18,000 towards his legal bill for evicting an unwelcome tenant from his London home, though they gave Mr Lamont the benefit of the doubt. They said yesterday that strict observance of the Commons rules for MPs about declaring business interests was an important way for ministers to minimise the risks from any activity 'which overlaps the border between their public duties and private interests'. In his defence, Mr Gummer wrote at length to the committee, explaining that he had been left out of pocket by having to carry out other work for the occasion and clear up after it. He had allowed his home to be used for the show, he said, in order 'to bring British agriculture of all types to our guests' and strengthen the UK's negotiating hand on issues as diverse as bananas and conservation. He noted that 'even the cleaned out pond and the planting which is accounted a plus is not done in the way we would have chosen'. Mr Gummer wrote to the committee yesterday saying that he would register the work. He also welcomed the committee's acceptance that he had not intended to conceal the work or the fact that it was sponsored.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / How To Spend It: Secret of barbecue fires without smoke - Charcoal is the key ingredient for cook-outs. Peter Knight seeks a good piece of charred wood PLAYING RAP music very loudly or encouraging Rover to yap all night might be efficient ways to annoy the neighbours, but there is nothing to beat smoking them out with a badly burning barbecue. Clouds of acrid smoke supplemented by that evocative smell of vaporised fat from the chump chops is a sure-fire way of getting the occupants of No 20 in full retreat. That this is a common occurrence has more to do with the quality of charcoal than the incompetence of the chef. Nearly all the 45,000 tonnes of charcoal imported into Britain each year is badly made and environmentally dodgy. This is what the embryonic home-produced charcoal industry want us to believe and they are probably right. The black lumps we buy to fuel our summer cook-outs come mostly from developing countries in Africa, South America and the far East. The charcoal is made in the traditional way, either in a pit dug in the ground or in a huge mobile metal oven. Both methods allow the wood to burn slowly until only the charred remains are left. Good charcoal should be about 90 per cent carbon. At that level it will not smoke because there is little, if any, wood left. Much of the imported charcoal is not much better than blackened wood and that is why it smokes. Furthermore, the chances are that the charred lumps were originally a tropical hardwood or part of a mangrove swamp. This is hardly the fuel for the environmentally conscious 1990s, especially when the exporting nations rely mainly on wood-based fuels for their needy populations. Europe could make its own charcoal and in the process provide better management of its woods. This is specially true of the UK which has the raw materials, the know-how and the demand. In some rural areas you can buy local charcoal - made in the traditional way - but there is not enough supply to meet the demand from large retailers, such as petrol stations and DIY stores. Christopher Irwin wants to change this. He is a Suffolk farmer, in the timber business and regional secretary for the Timber Growers Organisation, which represents owners of private woods in the UK. 'Charcoal is the offal of logging. It is badly and wastefully produced from virgin forests in west Africa, South America and the far East. We've got the resources and the market here - why can't we put the two together?' Irwin says the market for second quality home-grown hardwood - which was once used for mining and paper making - has disappeared. Mines no longer use the wood and the paper mill in Kent which used to consume most of the county's coppiced wood, has been converted to use waste paper. 'We've got huge areas of neglected woodlands in the UK and nothing positive is being done about it,' he says. Irwin wants to harvest the woods - as they were since the middle ages - and use the cuttings to make high-quality charcoal in an environmentally sound way. There would be enough, he says, to supply the domestic market which is estimated to be growing at 5 per cent a year. Plenty of people and organisations are enthusiastic. Farmers who own woods, which are now commercially worthless, like the idea. The Forestry Commission  -the government agency in charge of the UK's state-owned woodlands - wants to see the woods pay their way. The World Wide Fund for Nature supports the idea too. Irwin's problem is how to keep the costs down. The wood has to be cut and transported. The charcoal has to be made in high-tech ovens equipped with the latest pollution-control equipment and then it has to be bagged in sizes suitable for the supermarkets. When Irwin does his sums he finds that his costs are marginally higher than the imported product, mainly because the imports exclude the environmental costs. Nevertheless he is confident that his idea could work and he is building a pilot plant to prove it. He might get some help from the supermarkets and DIY stores which constantly assure us of their environmental credentials. The UK's biggest DIY chain, B &amp; Q, is the most environmentally aware. Alan Knight, its environmental co-ordinator, says the store is committed to stock only timber from sustainable sources by 1995 and charcoal falls into that category. B &amp; Q gets its charcoal from Portugal where it is made from saw-mill off-cuts. He says B &amp; Q will consider a UK-made product. 'But just because it has a Union Jack on it does not mean that it will be stocked. It has to be well produced and competitive in price.' Irwin is disdainful of the UK attitude towards the quality of charcoal. 'The Germans, for example, are very particular about their charcoal and they would never buy the sort of rubbish that the British buy.' The Germans have an official standard for charcoal and this helps shoppers choose good from bad. A similar standard should be available throughout the EC by the end of next year. This should aid domestic producers if their quality is indeed superior to imports. A shift to better fuel will help some of the UK's depressed rural communities, produce better barbecues and certainly go some way to alleviate the discomfort of those poor smoked-out people at No 20.</p>

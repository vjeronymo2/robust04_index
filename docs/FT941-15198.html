			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / China trade threat to UK over Hong Kong China increased pressure on Britain at the weekend with a warning that the continuing dispute over Hong Kong could have a 'crippling effect' on trade. Remarks by a senior Chinese official seemed designed to draw attention to the possible costs of the festering Hong Kong issue for British business, at a time when previously icy Chinese relations with France are returning to normal. (France announced last week that it would ban further arms sales to Taiwan. The decision by Paris in 1992 to authorise the sale of 60 Mirage jets to Taiwan led to a virtual freeze by Beijing on new agreements with French companies.) Mr Tong Jiemnin, deputy director-general for Europe at the trade ministry, told the official China Daily: 'Bilateral economic and trade relations can hardly escape damage from an unco-operative and unfriendly Britain.' Western officials in Beijing said that China was using the end of its bitter dispute with France to highlight possible economic penalties for Britain if the Hong Kong issue remained unresolved. The parallel with the French case will cause additional nervousness among British companies which have been strenuously seeking more business with China through high-level trade missions, some headed by government ministers. The efforts have already secured a substantial increase in Sino-British trade, though from a low level. British businesses say they have seen so far no detrimental effects on trade from the dispute over Hong Kong, despite previous threats from Beijing. The potential loss of big infrastructural contracts, especially in the power and energy industries, would be of particular concern to Britain. Sino-British talks on proposals by Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to broaden democracy in the colony broke down late last year after 17 rounds of negotiations. Mr Patten, some of whose proposals are now before Hong Kong's legislative council, will have talks with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, in London this week. On Thursday he will appear before the House of Commons select committee on foreign affairs.</p>

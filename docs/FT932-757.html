			<p>930626 FT  26 JUN 93 / Finance and the Family: The Week Ahead MOST OF the attention on GEC's results on Wednesday will centre on how generous the lumbering giant will be with the dividend. The City was disappointed with the cautious 5 per cent rise at the half way stage; optimists are looking for a 7 per cent advance in the second half of the year. Taxable profits are expected to be around the Pounds 860m mark for the year to March and the cash mountain is expected to measure up at around Pounds 2bn, just over Pounds 1bn from the company itself and the remainder from joint ventures. Most of GEC's main lines - telecommunications, power systems and medical systems are performing well. GEC may have had its share of criticism in the 1980s but analysts now take the view that its sober practices give it the feel of a company for the 1990s. ASDA, the UK grocery retailing chain, is expected to announce on Friday an improved full-year profit of between Pounds 135m and Pounds 142m. That would be a significant increase on last year's Pounds 86.8m before exceptional write-offs of Pounds 451.6m, and in excess of the company's own forecast of Pounds 130m given in January when it launched a Pounds 347m rights issue to accelerate its recovery programme. Analysts believe chief executive Archie Norman's strategy of a return to keener pricing and the 'Asda price' promise, and a shake-up of merchandising, buying and marketing, is bearing fruit. They also believe Asda has continued to see like-for-like sales running about 2 per cent ahead of the last financial year. A final dividend of 1.1p is forecast, giving a total of 1.6p, down from 2.1p last year. Airtours, the holiday company, announces half-year results on Monday, June 28, with losses before exceptionals expected to be Pounds 7.5m, compared with Pounds 5.6m last time. Holiday companies usually make a first-half loss as they are already paying some of their summer season costs. A further exceptional loss of Pounds 9.5m is likely, resulting from the failed bid for Owners Abroad earlier this year. Pre-tax profits of BPB Industries, Europe's biggest plasterboard producer, are forecast to have risen to between Pounds 48 and Pounds 55m for the 12 months to the end of March when the group publishes its annual results on Thursday.</p>

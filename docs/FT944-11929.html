			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: British partner is first to share in Ukraine oil find The first commercial oil production by a western joint venture in Ukraine is to begin later this month. The Poltava Petroleum Company, a UK-Ukrainian joint venture, yesterday said it had successfully tested its first well in the Novo-Nikolaevskoye fields in north eastern Ukraine. 'The preliminary results are very encouraging, well in excess of what had been expected,' said Mr David Davis, the company's general director in Poltava, 500km east of Kiev. JKX Oil and Gas, the UK partner, said the well produced 2,175 barrels of oil a day and 2m cubic feet of natural gas. The company believed the three fields that made up Novo-Nikolaevskoye could hold as much as 60m barrels of oil and 1,100bn cubic feet of gas. Peak daily production could approach 20,000 barrels of oil and 200m cubic feet of gas, it said. Full-scale development of the field would cost about Dollars 53m, and would mark a small step forward in Ukraine's efforts to wean itself of dependence on Russian oil imports and exploit natural resources largely undeveloped in the Soviet era. The former Soviet republic now depends almost exclusively on Russian oil and gas supplies - a sensitive issue in often strained Russo-Ukrainian relations. JKX, which has so far invested Dollars 15m in Poltava, has a 49 per cent stake in the project. The rest is split between Ukragasprom, the giant state oil and gas concern, and Ukraine's State Property Committee, which directs and oversees foreign investment in state companies. Ukraine has the option to buy 100 per cent of the oil and gas produced at world prices. But half of the revenues from domestic sales have to be converted to Ukrainian coupons. Mr David Robson, JKX managing director, said the 'forced conversion to coupons doesn't concern us that much' because the company would have significant coupon costs during the two and a half years or so that would be required to drill the 58 wells needed to fully drain the fields. Any hard currency exports from the development would not be subject to the forced coupon conversion. JKX's other Ukrainian venture, the Crimean Petroleum Company, is now assessing prospects in the Black Sea off the Crimean peninsula. It expected to begin exploratory drilling late next year, according to Mr Robson.</p>

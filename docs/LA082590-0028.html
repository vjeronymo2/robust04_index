			<p><P> August 25, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHOW'S ON WAY OUT BECAUSE OF HIMSELF  </P> <P> How like Eric Show, the ultimate antithesis of a team player, to carp and whine  just as the Padres finally begin coming together as a team. He's angry the  Padres "don't believe in him" and cites contract issues, Pat Dobson and  probably Chub Feeney as the reasons for his demotion to the bullpen --  disregarding his astronomical 6.25 ERA.  </P> <P> After all, this is the man who sat and sulked "why me?" as Pete Rose made a  sports trivia answer.  </P> <P> So Show wants a trade, and even his agent can't find an interested team. The  reason? A team plot against him in the front office. A pitching coach who has  turned around the careers of many (ask Mark Davis) who inexplicably hates Show.  Remember folks, Eric Show is a John Bircher, familiar with seeing conspiracies  and placing responsibilities and blame for one's fate on others. He has  forgotten that to be respected as a man requires him to act like one. I won't  be the only one glad to see him go.  </P> <P> JASON BRADY  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: SAN DIEGO'S DE LUCA TO FIGHT FOR NABF TITLE AT EL  CORTEZ  </P> <P> San Diego's Tony (Bazooka) De Luca (15-2, six knockouts) will attempt to keep  his career on track tonight at the El Cortez Convention Center when he fights  Guadalajara's Willie Salazar (35-14-1, 25 knockouts) for the North American  Boxing Federation title.  </P> <P> De Luca, 27, lost in his first opportunity to win the International Boxing  Federation flyweight title when his bout with Duke McKenzie on March 8 in  London was stopped on cuts in the fourth round. De Luca was slightly behind on  points when the referee ruled that the cut over his eye was too severe for him  to continue.  </P> <P> On May 18, De Luca came back to knock out Jose Manuel Diaz in the fifth round  at the El Cortez. De Luca is ranked fourth by the NABF and second by the USBA  and the WBA in the 108-pound flyweight division.  </P> <P> Salazar, who has held the NABF title for three years, lost his last bout in  Guadalajara on July 16.  </P> <P> The five-fight card, which is nearly a sellout, begins at 7:30 p.m. with the  main event scheduled to begin at approximately 9:15.  </P> <P> GOLF  </P> <P> Phil Mickelson of San Diego was one of two American singles winners in the  first round of the 32nd Walker Cup at Atlanta. The Walker Cup features the top  U.S. amateur golfers against those from Great Britain and Ireland.  </P> <P> Mickelson, who will be a sophomore at Arizona State, defeated Garth McGimpsey,  4 and 2. Mickelson, the youngest member of the team, teamed with Danny Yates to  halve their foursome match with McGimpsey and Stephen Dodd.  </P> <P> The Americans lost five of seven singles matches and trail Britain-Ireland, 7  1/2-4 1/2. The U.S. team has won the past eight Walker Cups and is 28-2-1  overall.  </P> <P> Leta Lindley of Carlsbad shot a 74 and is one shot behind the leader after two  rounds of the girls' 15-18 Junior Tournament of Champions at the Palm Beach  Polo and Country Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.  </P> <P> Lindley is at three-over par 147 and trails Kellie Daniel of Tampa, who shot a  75 Wednesday. Liz Bowman of Bonita is tied for 18th at 158.  </P> <P> No San Diego-area golfers made the cut in the boys' tournament. Todd Demsey of  Rancho Santa Fe missed the cut of 152 by a stroke.  </P> <P> BASKETBALL  </P> <P> The Gus Macker 3-on-3 Basketball Tournament will return to San Diego Jack  Murphy Stadium Oct. 28-29 with 1,000 teams expected to participate. Proceeds  from the tournament benefit the San Diego Police Athletic League, which  received $15,000 from the first Macker tournament in January.  </P> <P> The dates of the tournament have been approved for high school players by the  San Diego CIF, said Michael Brunker of the SDPAL. They will be able to  participate without endangering their eligibility because it starts before the  high school basketball season.  </P> <P> The tournament will have competition in all age groups. For entry forms, call  1-800-876-HOOP or the SDPAL at 231-9567.  </P> <P> VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State's women's volleyball match against an alumni team, originally  set for Saturday night, has been postponed because of resurfacing of the  Peterson Gym floor. No new date has been set.  </P></p>

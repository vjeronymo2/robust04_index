			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Eriks Matulis: "LNNK Formulates Demands in </F> Talks with Russia"]    [Text] Riga, 26 Mar -- At a board meeting of the Movement  for Latvian National Independence [LNNK] on Saturday [26 March],  a mutual resolution of the LNNK and its parliamentary faction  was accepted on "interstate negotiations with Russia." The  resolution states that the agreements with Russia were initialed  "contrary to the CSCE declaration and the UN resolution on  complete and unconditional troop withdrawal." LNNK is of the  opinion that initialing these agreements means including Latvia  in the sphere of Russian influence, as well as endangering  Latvia's sovereignty and the Latvian nation's possibilities to  survive. The resolution reads: "By accepting the initialed  agreements, Latvia does not resolve the problems connected with  troop withdrawal, because Russian Army units remain in Skrunda,  as well as in Estonia and Abrene."    Therefore, the LNNK board asks the president not to sign the  agreements. In addition, the Saeima [parliament] is requested  to pass -- in the first place -- a law on the status of  foreigners and stateless people, as well as appoint a new  delegation to the talks with Russia, which would resolve not  only the problem of troop withdrawal, but also such issues as  repatriation, emigration, the return of Abrene to Latvia, and  compensation for Latvia from Russia, as the legal heir to the  USSR.    The resolution also requests that the Saeima accept the  submitted draft law on a popular referendum, to which a question  should be added concerning citizens' opinions on the issue of  granting guarantees of social protection to Russian military  pensioners.    If the Saeima does not satisfy these demands, LNNK will  propose a popular ballot for special parliamentary elections.    At the LNNK board meeting, candidates for the Riga municipal  authorities elections were also chosen. In all, there were 61  candidates confirmed. Their names were not conveyed to the  press. As DIENA was told by LNNK Board Member Mirdza Vitola, the  decision was not yet final.</p>

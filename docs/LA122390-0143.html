			<p><P> December 23, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKETS: SEIDMAN GETS MAN OF YEAR AWARD FOR GIVING US THE LOWDOWN ON BANKS  </P> <P> L. William Seidman's job is in peril, but that hasn't stopped the outspoken  head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from trotting around the country  telling anyone who will listen that the U.S. banking industry is in trouble.  Seidman, of course, is already the bearer of bad news about the savings and  loan industry, so his candor about banks isn't fully appreciated in some  political circles.  </P> <P> But it is appreciated here. At a time the economy and banking system are, by  most accounts, in serious trouble, it's nice to hear some frank talk coming  from Washington. Because of his big mouth, Seidman wins this year's Man of the  Year award.  </P> <P> My annual awards may not be as prestigious and lucrative as Pulitzers or  Nobels, but at least you don't have to do much to win. In Seidman's case, all  he had to do was defy the White House by issuing gloomy predictions about the  banking system at the worst time politically -- before the recent congressional  elections. That wasn't too tough for the 69-year-old accountant and educator,  especially since Seidman is guaranteed a job until next October.  </P> <P> Last year's winner, former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson,  also was picked because of his habit of speaking out of turn. On Oct. 15, 1989,  Johnson leaked to the press the fact that the Fed would not permit the stock  market to crash again -- even as it was doing just that. Those comments --  issued surreptitiously and apparently without the knowledge of Fed Chairman  Alan Greenspan -- won Johnson the heartfelt gratitude of thousands of  investors.  </P> <P> Johnson undoubtedly used his Man of the Year award earlier this year to help  land himself a high-paying job with the Washington-based consulting firm Smick  Medley International, which promptly changed its name to give Johnson top  billing.  </P> <P> Seidman may also be looking for new employment soon. There were widespread  rumors earlier this year that a peeved President Bush would not reappoint him  as head of the FDIC and the Resolution Trust Corp. when his term expires -- and  was even pressing for his resignation. Bill Seidman can use me as a reference.  </P> <P> I also present:  </P> <P> * The Little Old Ant Award -- Remember the lyric, "Just what makes that little  old ant/Think he can move a rubber tree plant"? Well, the unions at UAL Corp.  have had high hopes that they could pull off a $4-billion acquisition of the  airline for more than three years. But they weren't as lucky as the ants. Tight  credit, higher loan standards and old-fashioned common sense killed their  efforts.  </P> <P> * Plain Vanilli Memorial Award -- Was that really President Bush singing the  anti-tax tune when he got elected? Or was he merely lip-syncing some words  taxpayers wanted to hear? Everyone with a wallet knows by now that the  President couldn't keep his promise not to raise taxes. And it is plain as can  be that, with revenues dropping during the recession, taxes will have to  continue rising until the federal budget deficit is reduced.  </P> <P> So here's some advice (in addition to the award) for President Bush: Don't  raise the same old sin taxes. Instead, find some new sins to tax.  </P> <P> How about a $1 tax on the rental of R-rated and NC17-rated videotapes? And who  would complain if there is a 50-cent-a-gallon levy on fattening premium ice  cream?  </P> <P> And let's sock all those little Nintendo fanatics with a tax. Maybe $5 extra on  a cartridge would get kids to quit playing video games and make them watch more  TV like the rest of us. And how about a $1,000 tax on all firearms -- imposed  on manufacturers and importers? This way the budget deficit could be balanced  and Americans could still have the right to bear harm.  </P> <P> * The Granny Award -- Ma Bell, also known as AT&amp;T, gets this pitted silver  trophy for handling its proposed takeover of NCR Corp. with the delicacy  usually reserved for underfed linebackers. AT&amp;T isn't smart enough to make  its own computers successful, so it wants not only to pick the brains of NCR's  experts but also to own their brains.  </P> <P> So how does AT&amp;T go about doing this? Instead of engaging in the delicate  diplomacy of winning NCR over by making an offer too good to legally refuse, it  declares war. And this war is likely to lobotomize NCR. This shareholder, for  one, thinks AT&amp;T should have gone the extra mile.  </P> <P> * The Giant Eraser -- This is given to the bulk of the economists in this  country -- including the hierarchy of the Fed -- because they couldn't see the  economy sliding into a recession. These include all the predictors of the  fabled "soft landing" for the economy.  </P> <P> Even though business conditions were obviously deteriorating during the spring  and early summer, the vast majority of these experts waited for Saddam  Hussein's takeover of Iraq in August before getting out their erasers and  changing their upbeat business forecasts. Some waited even longer -- until  after Washington had botched the budget talks -- before abandoning the  optimism.  </P> <P> The eraser will come in handy for future forecasts.  </P> <P> * MVP -- Donald J. Trump has been hitting most of the curve balls thrown by his  creditors over the fence, so he is a runaway winner for Most Visible Pauper. He  gives new meaning to the phrase "house poor."  </P> <P> * Professor Emeritrash -- Junk bond king Michael Milken not only got himself an  endowed chair in a federal prison for 10 years, but he also managed to become a  symbol of 1980s decadence. This despite his moderate lifestyle and  well-publicized acts of charity.  </P> <P> But let's not be too hard on Milken. He may have preached the gospel of junk,  but he didn't force anybody to get knee-deep in the slime.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Investors Discounted the Latest Fed Easing  </P> <P> If the Federal Reserve Board were a gunslinger, it would have fired its final  bullet last week at its target, the economy. But as far as the stock market is  concerned, the accuracy of the aim and the potency of the projectile are still  in doubt.  </P> <P> That's the long way of explaining why stock prices didn't rally strongly when  the Fed made its most overt move yet at injecting some life in the staggering  economy. While the half-point drop in the discount rate did cause a 30-minute  flurry of buying on Wall Street this past Tuesday, the action didn't create a  sense of euphoria or even relief.  </P> <P> "The market is very much into a 'What are you going to do for me today and  tomorrow?' " says Ellen Harris, chief investment officer of Paine Webber Inc.'s  domestic mutual funds.  </P> <P> As far as Wall Street was concerned, this past week's cut to 6 1/2% in the rate  that the Fed charges banks to borrow money from the central bank was  yesterday's news -- widely anticipated and with more symbolic than real  importance. The central bank had already reduced reserve requirements for banks  (bullet No. 1 and tinkered with the Fed funds rate (bullet No. 2).  </P> <P> "One of the reasons people get bullish when the Fed cuts interest rates is  because it is supposed to stimulate the economy," says Francis Scotland,  managing editor of International Bank Credit Analyst, a publication located in  Montreal. This time, says Scotland, the market didn't become optimistic because  it isn't certain that the recent Fed moves will have a beneficial impact on  business.  </P> <P> The Fed, says Scotland, "will have to cut interest rates a lot more before the  stock market and the economy can be expected to bottom out, let alone recover."  He adds that the Federal Reserve may even have to "overreact" before it can get  banks to lend again and borrowers to go further into debt.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial index, of course, is up more than 250 points from its  October yearly low. Much of that gain, experts say, was the market anticipating  a drop in interest rates. But the improvement is also partially due to an  occasional easing in Mideast tensions, and to professional money managers who  want to get "winning" stocks their portfolios before year-end.  </P> <P> Hugh Johnson, chief market strategist with First Albany Corp., thinks the Fed's  action on borrowing costs will eventually recharge the economy. "It's one of  the many pieces that goes into the elaborate configuration that in time will  turn confidence," Johnson says.  </P> <P> The big question, however, is how much time it will take for the economy to  respond. Johnson believes that the reaction to the Fed's recent moves may be  delayed because the financial system in this country is unable to benefit as it  has in the past to monetary stimulus. "What we are seeing is the results of the  financial excesses of the 1980s," he adds.  </P> <P> Johnson believes that it would be premature for the stock market to start  cheering what the Fed is doing.  </P> <P> Apparently the market agrees.  </P> <P> Square D Co.'s stock has been climbing on takeover rumors, the origin of which  -- until now -- was unknown. It turns out that a French firm, Schneider AG,  raised $1 billion and is rumored to be interested in "strategic" moves. Since  Schneider, which is in construction, once bought a company in Square D's field  -- electrical equipment -- the takeover rumor was a natural development. Square  D has denied any development that would be affecting its stock . . . Stock  options are a valuable executive perk, but they are worthless when a company's  shares have fallen below the price at which the options can be exercised. Even  though that has happened in many cases the last few months, consultant Towers  Perrin says only 8% of 95 companies it surveyed planned to reissue executive  stock options on more favorable terms. Life in the executive suite isn't always  wonderful . . . But KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, says directors are  being treated a whole lot better these days. Top-paid directors get a retainer  of $20,000 to $25,000 a year, plus between $700 and $1,000 per board meeting.  That's substantially higher than the prior year. Some firms, such as Burlington  Northern and Compaq Computer, are even giving directors equity in the  companies.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Baby Boomerangers' May Factor Into Slump  </P> <P> If this recession turns out to be a bad one, at least one economist says you  can place a lot of the blame on the "baby boomerangers."  </P> <P> Richard F. Hokenson, which specializes in demographics, says the large number  of young adults (especially men) who are returning to live with their parents  is keeping the growth in new households down to unreasonably low levels. And  without new households springing for things such as refrigerators, sofas and  beds, the economy will suffer.  </P> <P> Hokenson says that between March, 1989, and March, 1990, only 517,000 new  households were forced in the United States. That's growth of just 0.56%.  </P> <P> The only periods in this country's recent history that were worse, he says,  were between 1982 and 1983, when there was growth of 0.47%, and 1931 to 1932,  when new households increased 0.47%.  </P> <P> "That such a small gain precedes the onset of the current recession is an  ominous precedent for the downturn that is now unfolding," says Hokenson.  </P> <P> "Household formations always slow as the recession takes hold because part of  the decision on whether you maintain your own household and move out of your  parent's home is a function of the economy," he adds.  </P> <P> Hokenson says the number of households in the country could shrink during this  recession, which would be the first time that has happened in this century.  "Even during the Great Depression, households continued to grow," he added.  </P> <P> Don't underestimate the importance of these statistics. Hokenson says nearly  22% of the nation's gross national product is connected with the home.  </P> <P> Housing, of course, could be affected by the smaller growth in new households.  But if you look around your own home, you can figure out for yourself which  other industries might be hurt.  </P></p>

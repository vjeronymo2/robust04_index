The proposed amendment clarifies the Commission's interpretation that the FCRA requires the disclosure of ``risk scores'' to consumers by consumer reporting agencies. This action responds to widespread interest in this issue, and various inquiries the Commission and its staff have received about it. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Comments must be received on or before August 16, 1994.

A risk score assesses the likelihood of a particular adverse event, such as default or bankruptcy, based on various factors in a consumer report. The result of this evaluation is communicated by means of a numerical score. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 609 of the FCRA requires a consumer reporting agency, upon receiving a request and proper identification from a consumer, to ``clearly and accurately disclose to the consumer .&blank;.&blank;. [t]he nature and substance of all information (except medical information) in its files on the consumer at the time of the request.'' A consumer reporting agency also must disclose, in most instances, the sources of the information in the consumer's file, as well as the recipients of any consumer report on the consumer which the reporting agency has furnished six months preceding the consumer's request (or two years, if the report is for employment purposes). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On February 11, 1992, the Commission amended its FCRA Commentary to state that, pursuant to section 609 of the FCRA, ``a risk score (or other numerical evaluation, however named) that is reported by a consumer reporting agency to a client to assist in evaluating a consumer's eligibility for credit (or other permissible purposes) must be disclosed (along with an explanation of the risk score)'' to a consumer requesting disclosure of his or her credit file from the consumer reporting agency. 57 FR 4935&hyph;36 (Feb. 11, 1992). It noted that Congresswoman Leonor Sullivan, when introducing the conference report on the bill that ultimately enacted the FCRA, had stated: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=2 --> (The House conferees) stressed that the consumer should have access to all information  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> in any form which would be relayed to a prospective employer, insurer or creditor in making a judgment as to the worthiness of the individual's application for such benefits.*&blank;*&blank;* It is not intended that the credit reporting firm should have a free hand in excluding from the consumer's access information other than medical information it just does not want to give him, but will give to a client-user. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=3 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 116 Cong Rec. 36572 (October 12, 1970) (emphasis added) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> After the Commission amended the FCRA Commentary, several industry representatives requested clarification of the revision. As part of this process, some of these parties (as well as consumer representatives and other interested parties) submitted informal statements of their positions that appear on the Commission's public record. Commissioners and Bureau of Consumer Protection staff have discussed these issues with industry, consumer and state representatives. During these discussions, the following three principal issues arose concerning the applicability of the FCRA to risk scores: (1) When a consumer reporting agency must disclose a risk score; (2) what score(s) must be disclosed; and (3) what type of explanation of the score, if any, must be provided as part of the disclosure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to these inquiries, the Commission proposes to expand the discussion of risk scores in the FCRA Commentary as set forth below. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

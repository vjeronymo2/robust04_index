			<p>BFN     [Text] Jakarta (JP) -- Indonesia is prepared to import  10,000 tons of high-quality rice from the U.S. under the GSM  [expansion unknown]-102 credit guarantee program, Minister of  Food Ibrahim Hasan says.    Ibrahim told a meeting of editors and reporters here  yesterday that the imported rice, due to its fine quality, would  not threaten local rice producers.    "This has been approved by President Suharto and a  memorandum  of understanding will soon be signed between the governments of  the two countries," Ibrahim said.    He said the imported rice would likely only be sold at  top-rated restaurants and hotels and wouldn't prevent  Indonesians from continuing to consume the inferior  locally-produced rice.    Under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),  Indonesia is actually required to import as much as three  percent of its domestic consumption of some 20 million tons of  rice.    He said the world market supply was only about 12 million  tons of rice or about four percent of the world output, while  Indonesia's domestic rice production reached 25 million tons a  year.    "The world rice market is dominated by the U.S., Vietnam,  and  Thailand who supply 60 to 70 percent of the world market,"  Ibrahim said.    He, therefore, saw the plan to buy 10,000 tons of rice from  the U.S. as an effective way of meeting GATT rules.    Ibrahim said the GSM-10 will guarantee U.S. $200 million in  loans for U.S. agricultural exports to Indonesia such as rice,  soybeans, cotton, and meat. "The loans will mature within three  years and the interest will not exceed 3 percent," he said.    "We are also proposing to import about 75,000 tons of  soybeans," he said.    Ibrahim added that the imports would also benefit Indonesia  in terms of soft-loan financing.</p>

			<p><P> May 18, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> UCI UNVEILS 15-YEAR PLAN FOR RESEARCH PARK, HOMES  </P> <P> UC Irvine officials unveiled a 15-year blueprint for growth Wednesday that  includes development of a long-awaited research park and an urban community  with retail and housing development that still would preserve nearly a third of  the campus' 1,510 acres for woods and recreation.  </P> <P> The research park, which is expected to be a magnet for biomedical firms and  other high-technology companies that would work cooperatively with the public  university, is the most innovative and potentially controversial element of the  plan for the still-growing 25-year-old university.  </P> <P> UCI Chancellor Jack W. Peltason has referred to the planned research park as  the path of the future for research-oriented universities such as UCI. Situated  in the heart of Orange County's growing high-tech corridor, some have predicted  the university park could spur development on the scale of Stanford's Silicon  Valley or the Research Triangle near Duke University in North Carolina.  </P> <P> Officials of Orange County technology firms, which have increasingly been  interested in access to the university, said such a research park would  increase the stature of UCI and Orange County businesses as centers for  scientific advancement.  </P> <P> "This can create an immediate knowledge transfer," Gregory Ross, a senior  partner in the Orange County office of the accounting firm Arthur Young &amp;  Co, said of the planned research park.  </P> <P> "Instead of building in the Irvine Spectrum several miles away, a company can  now be in walking distance of university researchers, labs and advanced-level  students," said Ross, who has tracked the progress of Orange County's  technology industry for 8 years.  </P> <P> "The university can take its theories and patents and translate them into  viable products," Ross said. He said the university will be able to obtain lab  space and equipment in exchange for land it cannot use.  </P> <P> The planned construction of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor,  which is to skirt the southwest perimeter of the campus, will make the proposed  biomedical research park highly accessible and, it is anticipated, even more  attractive to prospective firms. The corridor will have an interchange at Bison  Road, which leads directly to the health sciences complex and proposed research  park, and is expected to become the primary entrance to the UCI campus.  </P> <P> UCI's Long Range Development Plan, which will be the subject of public hearings  in Irvine and Newport Beach and will be presented to the UC Board of Regents in  September, scales back more aggressive growth plans of 1963 and 1970, when it  was anticipated that students would number nearly 30,000 by 1990, instead of  the current 14,500. Present projections are for 26,500 graduate and  undergraduate students at UCI by 2005.  </P> <P> Because Orange County and the surrounding communities of Irvine and Newport  Beach would have anticipated greater university expansion based on the previous  plans, no significant community opposition is anticipated, said Ray Catalano,  assistant executive vice chancellor.  </P> <P> "No plan has no enemies," said Catalano, a former Irvine councilman who  maintains close ties to city government, "but we believe our neighbors will be  pleased with this plan."  </P> <P> Irvine Mayor Larry Agran said he sees great potential for community benefit  from UCI's projected growth and the planned research park.  </P> <P> "I assume it is going to be an extraordinarily sophisticated level of research,  and we all understand that there is a synergism created by research at the  university on the one hand, and its application in the private sector," Agran  said. "It can be a real benefit to the community, and I'm hopeful that the plan  meets our concerns with regard to traffic generation and other environmental  effects."  </P> <P> Bill Speros, an Irvine slow-growth advocate, said he and other residents are  not opposed to the plan because "it puts most of the traffic on the MacArthur  Boulevard (southern) side of the campus, away from current residential areas."  </P> <P> Speros, who noted that UCI still will have a lower population than UCLA and  will be spread out over more acreage, added, "I think most of us realize that  UCI is an asset to the whole state," he said.  </P> <P> Ken Delino, executive assistant to Newport Beach City Manager Robert L. Wynn,  said he had not seen the campus growth plan and is "not in a position to  comment on it." Other city officials were not immediately available for  comment.  </P> <P> While university officials intend to hold public hearings on the proposed  long-range development plan, the cities have no veto powers. One hearing is  planned for the city of Irvine, although no date has been set. A second hearing  may be conducted in Newport Beach. The development plan will be available for  public inspection starting Friday at the university library and at libraries in  Irvine and Newport Beach.  </P> <P> The new development plan, in the works since 1985, was completed after pacts  were reached last summer with the city of Irvine to limit university-generated  traffic, and with the Irvine Co. to remove a 25-year-old deed restriction that  would allow construction of 2 million square feet of commercial buildings on  UCI land.  </P> <P> The proposal also includes the first concrete steps toward something university  and community officials have only dreamed about until now: a full-fledged  biomedical and high-tech research park.  </P> <P> Two parcels totaling 235 acres have been set aside for private research  buildings, to be built by research firms and then leased back to the firms.  Based on the model of UCI's first such venture, the Nelson Research &amp;  Development Co. center built in 1983, the park would offer lease income, space  and materials for research by UCI students and professors, and an enhanced  potential to win multimillion-dollar research grants.  </P> <P> Catalano said Wednesday that high-tech and medical research firms already in  Orange County will do more to foster Silicon Valley-style growth here than  UCI's relatively small research parcels. Still, UCI is likely to be a magnet  for biomedical research firms that want to tap into university brainpower, he  said.  </P> <P> UCI has tried for several years to increase its role in the high-tech  community. Earlier this year, in its most ambitious attempt to attract private  business interests, university officials met with executives from local  biomedical firms and presented more than a dozen technologies being developed  by UCI researchers that could benefit from corporate involvement.  </P> <P> Some executives have said the absence of a research park has kept the  university from being as involved as it would like.  </P> <P> Robert P. Kelley Jr., president of the Southern California Technology  Executives Network, said that UC San Diego has taken the lead in the UC system  in its involvement with the business community, but UCI has the potential to  catch up.  </P> <P> "In San Diego, businesses think of UC San Diego as an immediate resource. In  Orange County, that has been emerging lately," Kelley said.  </P> <P> And with the availability of land on and near campus for such expansion, Kelley  said, UCI has the potential to take the lead among universities in the UC  system in its involvement with technology firms.  </P> <P> But some caution that there are drawbacks to corporate involvement with a  university, which operates more slowly than a rapidly developing firm. And  Kelley said some in the university might oppose the partnership approach, out  of fear that corporate development could compromise academic independence.  </P> <P> "You're not going to find a lot of cheering and shouts of joy in some parts of  the campus," he predicted.  </P> <P> Part of the long-range plan calls for more faculty and student housing on  campus, as well as a so-called "Main Street" complex of retail shops and  offices along Pereira Drive.  </P> <P> With UC Irvine's population projected to nearly double by 2005, traffic  generated by the university is a concern of county and local officials alike.  </P> <P> "We know there are some pretty ambitious expansion plans that UCI has," said  Ernie Schneider, director of the county's Environmental Management Agency. "Our  concern would be how that would impact the region's circulation system. Traffic  is terrible there (around the university) and UCI is a very big draw."  </P> <P> UCI officials have already signed a memorandum of understanding with the city  of Irvine that future growth would not generate more than 146,000 average daily  trips, up from the current 40,000 average daily trips to and from the  university. And while that is far below earlier growth estimates of 240,000  average daily trips generated by the university, it is enough to have a  significant impact on traffic in the area.  </P> <P> "In and of itself, that is enough to handle three lanes (of traffic) on a  freeway," Schneider said of the 146,000 figure.  </P> <P> Times Staff writers Jeffrey A. Perlman and John Charles Tighe also contributed  to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> UCI POPULATION  </P> <P> The newest UCI long-range development plan calls for more modest growth than  the 1970 plan (27,500 students by 1990). However, UCI anticipates more than a  fivefold increase in staff for its Health Sciences Complex by 2005.  </P> <TABLE CWL="3.76IN:1.89IN:2.44IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="3"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW>

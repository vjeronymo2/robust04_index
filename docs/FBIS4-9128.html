			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Russian Ambassador's First News </F> Conference"]    [Text] At his first news conference, Russian Ambassador to  Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]  Yuriy Petrovich Trusin announced his country will open an  embassy in Skopje at the beginning of May. The conference  focused on Moscow's position on events in Bosnia. He described  the situation there as dangerous. The Russian view, he said, is  this conflict must be resolved through an equal cooperation  between the United States, Russia, and the European Union, but  under UN surveillance. Moscow insists that the parties in the  war declare an immediate cease-fire and sit down at the  negotiating table. Trusin said Russia also demands and urgent  lifting of the sanctions against Yugoslavia. In regard to  yesterday's statement by [Deputy Foreign Minister] Churkin that  Russia ought to break negotiations with Bosnian Serbs, because  of their failure to keep promises, Trusin said it was an  emotional remark and added his country's attitude toward the  Bosnian crisis remains unchanged.</p>

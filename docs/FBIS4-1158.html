			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Ferdinand Bigumandondera] </F>   [Text] Bujumbura, 23 Apr (PANA) -- Military and political  authorities in Burundi have underscored the need to disarm  civilians before any discussion on reforming the Armed Forces,  but there is division on the method to be adopted, sources said  in Bujumbura.    Interim president, Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, insists that  the  discussion must first of all find out why the civil population  continues to carry arms. The opposition disagrees saying the  only way to guarantee minimum security for the population is to  immediately neutralise armed gangs.    The disagreement has automatically stalled efforts to find a  lasting solution to the civil strife in the central African  country where thousands of people have perished in the blood  bath sparked by the killing of President Melchior Ndadaye in a  failed coup in October 1993.    Some leaders of the ruling Front for Democracy in Burundi  (Frodebu), led by Interior Minister Leonard Nyangoma -- who was  away from the country for a month at the height of the crisis --  totally oppose disarming of the civil population. For them, the  question of surrendering arms to the military does not arise.    It is expected that the armed gangs operating in Kamenge (a  hot spot in the northern part of Bujumbura) will resist if the  military try to disarm them by force.    On Saturday [23 April], the Burundi Government issued a  48-hour ultimatum to civilians carrying firearms -- legally or  illegally acquired -- to surrender them to administrative  authorities in their areas before 6 PM local time (16:00 GMT) on  Sunday.    The Hutu population (majority ethnic group but a minority in  the Armed Forces since the bloody events of 1972 which deprived  Hutus of top positions in the government) have been stocking  weapons, with the collaboration of the authorities, since the  assassination of Ndadaye. To justify this attitude, the Hutus  say that the Army, which is dominated by the Tutsi minority  ethnic group and responsible for Ndadaye's assassination, cannot  be trusted and should be disbanded.    As a consequence, armed militias have been set up in the two  camps. Hutu youths, most of whom are unemployed, are demanding  to be enlisted into the Army and Gendarmerie (mobile police) in  the same numbers as their Tutsi counterparts. They threaten to  use the type of force witnessed recently in Kamenge if their  demands are not met.    The Hutu youths receive support from the unregistered Party  for the Liberation of the Hutu People (Palipehutu), an extremist  movement based in neighbouring Rwanda. In November 1991, it  carried out a futile armed attack on military positions in the  capital.</p>

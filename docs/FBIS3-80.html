			<p>Reflecting     a hardening of its opposition to the prospective  introduction of Patriot missiles in South Korea, North Korea has  staged a "mass rally" and sharpened its rhetoric against Seoul  and Washington.  At the 29 March rally in Pyongyang--the first  such rally Pyongyang media have reported being staged against  deployment of the missiles--the main speaker, a city People's  Committee functionary, characterized current tension on the  peninsula as such that a "nuclear war" could be touched off "by  accident."  He went on to warn that if the United States and the  South "challenge" the DPRK, it will "punish them hundreds and  thousand times"(Pyongyang radio, 29 March)--a departure from  Pyongyang's heretofore cautious pronouncements that went no  further than to promise unspecified "countermeasures."  Like the  speaker at the rally, an authoritative Nodong Sinmun  commentator's article on 29 March also pledged to "deal a  thousand-fold retaliatory blow" if the South unleashed a war  against the North "in league with outside forces" (KCNA, 29  March).  In a similar vein, KCNA on 30 March, commenting on the  "increased [U.S.] military threat to the North," ominously warned  Washington that "if one likes fire he is bound to get burnt."     Pyongyang has balanced its harsher rhetoric on the Patriot issue  with indirect appeals for resumption of negotiations with  Washington.  Thus, a KCNA report on 29 March claiming that  foreign leaders are calling for a peaceful resolution of the  nuclear issue cited the Malaysian prime minister as saying that  the Korean nuclear issue "should be resolved through  negotiations" and not "by means of pressure."  It portrayed the  Congolese prime minister as similarly prescribing "dialogue and  negotiation" for the issue.  The report also cited the Senegalese  prime minister as ''expressing hope'' that the issue will be  resolved through "DPRK-U.S. talks."     (AUTHOR:  YIM.

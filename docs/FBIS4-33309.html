			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique by the Mutual Support Group, GAM, marking the </F> 10th anniversary of its founding, on 3 June; place not given;  from the "Telepress" newscast -- read by GAM President Nineth  Montenegro]    [Text] The GAM wishes to state that we have spent 10 years  defending life and liberty. That is why we deem it important to  reiterate our profound commitment to assist in building in  solidarity a multiparty, humanitarian, and developed Guatemala.  This objective, however, will not be possible if we do not  decentralize wealth and political power and simultaneously  reconvert military doctrines at the domestic level. These are  the basic principles on which we can build a new Guatemala and  create conditions to achieve a new way for Guatemalans.    At the international level, it requires the awareness that  Guatemala must obtain the necessary unconditional support to  create a true peace process, respecting our right to find a  possible and realistic model for the country. We cannot survive  on good intentions alone. Only facts serve as the guidelines to  consolidate the present and view the future. By the same token,  the relatives of missing persons today demand the willingness to  engage in dialogue and peace negotiations. We must not create  sterile expectations that do not materialize and heighten the  people's frustration, leading only to acceptance and silence.    We recognize, however, that 10 years later new spaces have  been opened which can permit civilian society to play a  predominant role. This demands that we cast aside traditional  and backward positions that attempt to throw the country  backwards at every level. Also, the civilian society must  assume its responsibility with seriousness and obviate outmoded  ideas, which would have us believe that order and security imply  authoritarianism and the return of those who years ago harmed us  a lot. It is also important to assess 10 years of struggle in  which our organization should have readapted to the moment,  without losing sight of its principles.    Of course, the GAM views with good eyes the rapprochement  with diverse sectors of civil society, which are not necessarily  included within the context of the popular and labor movement.  Currently there is a renewed form of thinking, which makes us  believe that a common front of all sectors, including political  parties, may exist in the immediate future to allow us to find  solutions of consensus. We believe there is a moral force that  obliges us to discuss significant topics. That does not imply  that we fail to recognize that new forms of terrorism persist,  seeking to destroy our small achievements, that perhaps we will  have to face a new escalation of violence that will possibly  claim many lives and intimidate others. We are aware of the  historic moment we are living in Guatemala, and we assume it  with responsibility.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / US Senate passes Dollars 22bn anti-crime bill THE US Senate yesterday overwhelmingly passed a Dollars 22bn (Pounds 14.7bn) anti-crime bill, but doubts remained whether both houses of congress could agree on unified legislation before they adjourn next week. Following its 95-4 vote, the Senate immediately moved on to debating the Brady bill, which would impose a five-day waiting period on buyers of handguns. This measure, named after Mr James Brady, the White House press secretary severely wounded in 1981 in the attempt on President Ronald Reagan's life, has already secured the approval of the House. The most significant features of the omnibus crime bill include funding for an additional 100,000 police officers, a ban on the sale of 19 types of semi-automatic assault weapons, among them the AK-47 and the Uzi, and tougher sentences for persistent offenders and those found guilty of violent crime in which guns are used. Ms Janet Reno, the attorney general, said in a television interview that both the Brady bill and the ban on certain types of assault weapons were 'critically important steps in developing a programme where we make sure that weapons are rationally and properly used in America'. Unlike the Senate, the House has taken a piecemeal approach to crime legislation, passing individual bills rather than lumping them together. Even if reconciliation cannot be achieved in a conference committee of both chambers over the next few days, legislation can be carried over into the next session, starting in January. In a magazine interview this week, President Bill Clinton said he might advance additional gun control measures next year, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York has already proposed punitive tax increases on the sale of ammunition. The president did not exclude asking for a total ban on handgun sales, though this would probably come much later. The National Rifle Association, the powerful lobby against gun control, had some success in watering down the Senate bill and will be particularly pleased if the Brady bill falls by the wayside, as it has for seven years.</p>

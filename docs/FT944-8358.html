			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Kuchma to discuss Chernobyl closure Ukraine will present a new plan to shut down the Chernobyl nuclear power station during President Leonid Kuchma's summit in Washington this week, senior Ukrainian government officials said at the weekend. Ukraine will seek western financing of Dollars 1.49bn (Pounds 90m) to decommission the plant, Dollars 2bn to finish work on three Soviet-era reactors elsewhere in the country and Dollars 3bn to build two western-type units near the Chernobyl site, they said. In turn, Ukraine would cover up to Dollars 6bn in other costs associated with shutting down Chernobyl - site in 1986 of the world's worst nuclear accident - including constructing a new sarcophagus to encase the damaged fourth reactor, according to Mr Mikhail Umanets, head of Ukraine's nuclear power authority. The proposal, on its face, falls short of conditions sought by the Group of Seven leading industrialised countries this summer. Ukraine does not agree immediately to close one of the two operating reactors at Chernobyl and does not set a timetable. The Chernobyl reactors can be closed only once the western-style plant is built, Ukrainian officials said. Work on restarting a third Chernobyl reactor, badly damaged by fire in 1991, continues. 'After ratifying (the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty last week), we want the west to endorse this course,' said Mr Umanets, citing a deal the US and Japan struck with North Korea earlier this year to build new plants. 'A better option is hard to find.' Mr Dmytro Tabachnyk, head of the president's administration, appealed for support - especially from the EU - and pointed to Ukrainian willingness to meet western states halfway. Ukraine's government this month approved an energy sector overhaul drawn up with World Bank help. The steps, including electricity price increases for industry and household consumers, are aimed at more efficient energy use and lessened dependence on Russian and Turkmen imports. The EU states, led by Germany and France, have sought Chernobyl's closure after Ukraine's parliament last year voted to keep it open and the government last February secretly decided to restart work on the third fire-damaged reactor. At the Naples summit this summer, the Group of Seven leading industrial nations pledged Dollars 200m in initial grants for shutdown if Ukraine accepted its action plan. The EU, viewing Chernobyl as of paramount concern, also offered Dollars 480m in loans and Dollars 115m in grant aid at the Corfu summit this summer. Additional support would come from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank. Ukraine's government, after committing itself to eventual shutdown in April, dismissed the aid as insufficient. The US has worked to bridge differences. Mr William White, the US deputy secretary of energy, last week hinted at a breakthrough in Washington. 'Stay tuned,' he said. 'The energy sector and Chernobyl in particular will be a big part of the summit agenda.'</p>

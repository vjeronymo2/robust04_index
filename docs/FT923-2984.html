			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Technology: Tug of war in the rope industry - Stronger, lighter and more wear-resistant fibres Rope-making must be one of the few industries where modern-day manufacturers can put a sample of their latest product development on a table and compare it with what their forbears were making 4,000 years ago. At Bridon Marine in Charlton, south-east London, a piece of Egyptian rope from the days of the Pharaohs is exhibited proudly in John Yeardley's office. But the technical director of sister company Bridon Fibres gives pride of place to a new product with which he and Ian Hosea, director and general manager of Bridon Marine, are hoping to give the marine rope industry a firm shake. Bridon Marine, part of Doncaster-based Bridon, the world's leading rope-making group, has just launched TQ12, a completely new polyolefin rope which is intended to answer the hard-pressed shipping industry's ever growing demands for stronger, lighter and more wear-resistant rope. It is perhaps because rope-making has been around for so long that its modern-day technical achievements rarely merit much attention. But the demands made on modern synthetic-fibre-based ropes would stretch the talents even of an early 20th century rope-maker, let alone an Egyptian craftsman using natural fibres. Yet the industry retains strong links with its past. Bridon's factory illustrates the transformation in manufacturing over the past 30 years, with giant mechanical bobbins encircling each other in an industrial version of the maypole dance. When a fibre rope is completed it still requires craft skills to splice the loop at each end, a process which has long been mechanised in steel rope. The rope itself has changed too, because of the possibilities offered by synthetic fibres. The 1960s brought rope plaited from eight separate strands  -twisted lengths of fibre - then some 10 years later came double-braid rope  -basically a rope within a rope. More recently, Bridon has been making special oceanographic cables using Kevlar, the Du Pont composite material, as a low-stretch strength member to protect the electrical circuits. Its latest product, the first to emerge from a reorganised technical centre at Charlton, has a unique 12-strand construction. The aim, says Yeardley, is a much rounder, less lumpy rope than the eight-strand, cutting down wear but retaining the ability to make a single splice. The main advantage of TQ12, however, is a 50 per cent increase in strength for the same size of rope. A mid-sized 7 1/2 -inch rope made of TQ12 will hold a 63-tonne load before breaking, compared with 41.2 tonnes for a standard eight-strand rope. According to Yeardley, about half the extra strength comes from the way the raw material polymer chips are extruded into fibres, and the proprietary combination of water inhibitors and additives included at this stage. The rest comes from the 12-strand design, the angle of lay, and the method of termination. For Hosea, the new rope is a welcome addition to Bridon Marine's range when conditions are tough in the shipping industry. 'It's a good thing to do now because customers will see the benefits,' he says. The rope is aimed at the marine market - moorings for ferries, cruise ships, cargo ships - which is important for Bridon as it balances the peaks and troughs caused by big contracts from the offshore industry. 'We're going after business that is currently eight-strand,' he says, and is looking first at the UK, Scandinavian and US markets. So who said British industry is on the ropes?</p>

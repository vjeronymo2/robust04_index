			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FEINSTEIN, WILSON CAMPAIGNS FOR GOVERNORSHIP  </P> <P> Wilson's rhetoric is very familiar. Like George Bush, when running for  President, Wilson pledges to be the "education governor."  </P> <P> However, he is part of the same class of politicians who have seen constant  cuts in education -- Ronald Reagan, George Deukmejian and Bush. We cannot  afford another clone of Reaganomics for our state.  </P> <P> GWEN KOZMAN  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

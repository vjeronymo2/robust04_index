			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / Arts: Opening concert sets the theme The opening concert at Edinburgh sets the festival theme. A featured composer has always tended to be part of the music programme, but as the number of festivals proliferates, it is increasingly important for artistic directors to make sure that their festival looks different from the others. In his first year as Festival Director, Brian McMaster made 1992 the year of Tchaikovsky, cannily anticipating his centenary before other festivals could get in. This year he has avoided all three of the big anniversary composers (Grieg, Tchaikovsky, Rakhmaninov), which has turned out to be unnecessarily cautious, as nobody else is paying them much serious attention either. In their place we have Schubert and Janacek. The festival programme describes the two composers as a 'complementary and contrasting coupling'. This is another way of saying they have nothing in common. One was central to the Austro-German tradition; the other wholly outside it. One was a composer of youth; the other nearly 50 when his first major work was performed. Janacek is remembered primarily for his operas, a genre in which Schubert never enjoyed much success. At least the festival audience will have varied fare on its menu. If I had been planning the festival, I would have opened with Janacek's Sinfonietta, which bursts into life with a blazing fanfare of massed trumpets. McMaster preferred the suite derived by Vaclav Talich from the opera The Cunning Little Vixen, a misleading start as the music sounds more like Strauss in Talich's heavily romantic re-orchestration. The welcome novelty of the evening was a rare cantata by Janacek called Amarus. Outcast because the local community has turned against his mother, a young man is consigned to a monastery, where he lives a miserable life until he dies one day on his mother's grave, after watching a pair of young lovers. All the Janacek themes that were to become familiar are here: social prejudice, death as a release from suffering, the renewal of life. But the music is strangely stagnant, except when it hits upon a perky little theme for - of all things - the poor man's funeral march. Stefan Margita sang the tenor role of Amarus without excessive morbidity. To end: not Janacek's Glagolitic Mass, as might have been expected, but Schubert's lyrical Mass in A flat - fairly unfamiliar music again. The Edinburgh Festival Chorus claims the opening concert by right and sang with all its usual fervour, though smaller professional choruses these days can bring to music of this period a sharper focus and greater exactitude of pitch. Walter Weller conducted the Royal Scottish National Orchestra and a good quartet of soloists, led by Yvonne Kenny, with the mellifluous trio of Fiona Janes, John Mark Ainsley and Andreas Schmidt in support. In retrospect, there is one feature that these two composers have in common: both wrote interesting pieces of music that deserve a wider hearing. The prospect of spending the three weeks of the festival in their company raises one's spirits.</p>

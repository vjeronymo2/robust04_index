			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris builds confidence on interest rate scenario Hopes of a Bundesbank rate reduction today cut more ice in France than they did in Germany, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS liked the scenario so much that it pushed the CAC-40 index forward by 1 per cent, or 24.64 to 2,355.93. Turnover was estimated at a high FFr6bn. Euro Disney went against the rising trend, off FFr1.55 at FFr36.20, as investors reacted to a widening of its net loss in the three months of December. The market was also awaiting the outcome of a meeting by banks exposed to the group's debt on an independent report prepared by auditors. There was good news elsewhere. Peugeot, encouraged by a rise in January car sales, added FFr6 to FFr867 and Carrefour advanced FFr36 to FFr4,361 as it reported a 5 per cent improvement in 1993 turnover, although this was much in line with expectations. Paribas, which is expected to release 1993 results today, gained FFr26 to FFr589, while there were reports that it might be about to announce a rearrangement in its cross shareholding with Navigation Mixte, the investment concern, with some sources suggesting that it might lower its 29 per cent stake. AMSTERDAM saw strength in most of its main blue chips, and this took the AEX up 1.64 to 437.38. Akzo rose Fl 2.00 to Fl 210.60, up11 per cent on the year so far. The chemical group has benefited from its merger with Nobel, announced last November; but Flemings, in London maintained that there are more attractive recovery plays in the chemical sector, while Akzo's estimated net gearing of 67 per cent in 1994 and 60 per cent in 1995 'will restrain capital spending and any dividend increases for at least two years'. Fokker stayed busy as the aircraft manufacturer confirmed reports that it had, in the past, been paying Deutsche Aerospace high prices for air frames, but noted that the situation had since improved. The shares shed a further Fl 1.10 to Fl 21.80, off 8 per cent on the week so far and 12.8 per cent since the year's high on January 26. ZURICH resumed its advance after Tuesday's pause as strong demand took banking stocks to highs for the year and helped the SMI index 20.4 ahead to 3,169.1. UBS, the first of the leading banks to report 1993 results later this month, added SFr24 to SFr1,510 and SBC was SFr10 higher at SFr529. A SFr10 rise in Alusuisse to SFr640 was attributed to its recent moderate valuation and this week's rise among US aluminium suppliers following the agreement to cut global production. FRANKFURT was a market of individual stocks, the rise of just 4.34 to 2,184.01 in the Dax index masking some big changes at corporate level. Volkswagen liked the court ruling against the Adam Opel claim that VW had poached GM staff, rising DM3.30 to DM447.80. Mannesmann, the engineering group with telecom prospects, seemed even more pleased that DB Capital Markets (Deutschland) was issuing 1m American-style call warrants on the stock, andclosed DM10 higher at DM421. Turnover eased from DM10.5bn to DM9.4bn. Among smaller companies the software publisher, SAP, soared DM495, or 25 per cent to DM2,450 on a 15 per cent rise in net earnings. MILAN's Comit index rose 2.55 to a fifth consecutive high of 668.30. Montedison returned to the spotlight, adding L82 or 7.1 per cent to L1,243 as more analysts in the US and UK came to the view that the group was likely to return to profitability this year - rather earlier than many had originally thought. S G Warburg, which rates the stock as a buy, is holding presentations for analysts in Edinburgh and London today and tomorrow. Fiat rose L145 or 3 per cent to L5,011, shrugging off a protest against layoffs by tens of thousands of workers who packed the central square in Turin. Olivetti added L57 or 2.3 per cent to L2,489 in response to comments on Tuesday by Mr Carlo De Benedetti that he still hoped the computer group would break even this year. Shares in the newly privatised IMI, which begin trading next week in Milan, were quoted around L12,200 on the grey market in London, compared with the L10,900 offer price. MADRID gave domestic investment funds the credit for a sharp recovery after Tuesday's correction, the general index rising 5.10, or 1.5 per cent to 356.47 with turnover staying high at Pta48.4bn. Construction stocks rose 3.3 per cent as utilities took a relative breather; in banks, Banesto rose Pta15 to Pta870 after a high of Pta898. STOCKHOLM rose on better than expected results from Electrolux and news that Renault had sold part of its stake in Volvo. The Affarsvarlden index added 14.6 to 1602.8 in record turnover of SKr6.1bn. Electrolux B rose SKr26 or 7.3 per cent to SKr381 and Volvo B by SKr16 to SKr692.

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Johanna Mannila: "Forest Industry Committee </F> Wants To Put an End To Draining and Plowing of Forests by 1996"]    [Text] The forest industry environment committee has  unanimously proposed new laws and is demanding that nature  conservation programs be implemented within seven years.    The plowing and draining of forests and spraying of sapling  thickets with pesticides will come to an end by the end of 1996  if the unanimous proposals in the forest industry's first  environment program are implemented.    The recommendations are of great importance to the landscape  of northern Finland because over half of the forest regeneration  areas are being plowed. Machine contractors will be given two  years to adapt to the situation.    The forest industry's environment program was delivered to  Environment Minister Sirpa Pietikainen (Conservative) and  Agriculture and Forestry Minister Martti Pura (Center Party) on  Tuesday [15 March]. The program differs from the agriculture  program in that the committee proposes changes in the laws for  the forest industry, and it does not settle for recommendations.    According to the program, the diversification of commercial  forests will be the most important task of forestry experts  during the present decade.    The committee wants to call clear-cutting cultivation  cutting. In the committee's opinion, it is unfair to compare  Finland's few hectares of clear-cut forest with Canada and  Russia's thousands of hectares of logged forest, especially  since they are not worried about renewing their forests in those  countries -- by seeding and planting -- as we are in Finland.    The committee proposes 10 hectares as the initial size of  areas to be clear-cut; a clearing area could be as large as 15  hectares in Lapland. Clearings will not be completely stripped  anymore; some of the trees are supposed to be left to grow old  and decay.  <H5>  Order of Importance for Nature Conservation Programs </H5>   In its program the committee also proposes that the forest  law be revised and they demand that the current nature  conservation programs be implemented within the next seven  years. They lay particular emphasis on protection of the program  for the conservation of old forests and of threatened species.    "The purpose of the program is to change the forest industry  such that, in addition to timber production, the industry also  sees to the care of all of the forest wildlife and the  maintenance of biodiversity," the chairman of the committee,  general manager Juhani Viitala, emphasized.    The program teaches Finns a new expression, key biotope.    Groves, lush woodland, stream banks, shoreline, island, and  hardwood forests, among others, are ecologically important key  biotopes. The program lays emphasis on special care for them and  their importance to commercial forests.    In the committee's opinion, we ought to take a critical view  of the purchasing of forestland in connection with conservation.  "We don't have to buy up everything. We're considering exchanges  of land, nature conservation bonds, shares in state companies,  and use restrictions as alternatives instead of redemption,"  Viitala said.    On behalf of the health of the forests, they propose in the  program that logging be increased.    Finland's forest growth comes to 85-88 cubic meters, 3  million of which are in protected areas. "We estimate that  compliance with this program would exclude 5 to 10 million cubic  meters from logging. Since 55 million cubic meters are logged in  normal years, implementation of the environment program will not  jeopardize the forest industry's growing need for timber either."  <H5>  Forest Boards Would be Responsible for Monitoring </H5>   Locally, forest boards would be responsible for the  diversity  of forest wildlife and its development. The forest boards would  work in cooperation with environment officials.    Monitoring the care of the environment would be entrusted to  the forest boards. Since difficulties that have arisen in  implementing conservation programs have negatively affected  relations with landowners, the committee proposes that forest  care associations serve as intermediaries in sales of woodpecker  forests.    "Landowners would get information on conservation programs  from representatives of forest care associations, with whom they  are used to doing business anyway. This is assuming that  environment officials inform the forest organizations on the  biological principles conservation is based on and provide them  with information on financing and alternative courses of  action," Viitala said.    Implementation of the environment program would cost the  government 260 million markkaa a year.  <H5>  Proposals for New Forest Laws </H5>   Law for the permanent use of forests: Finland's first  general  law governing forests. The drafting of the law has already begun  and it is supposed to go into effect in 1995. The law would  apply to all forests owned by owner-group associations, the  state, and corporations.    Private forest law: The promotion of forest wildlife  diversity would be specified as the goal of forest care. To go  into effect in 1996.    Laws on forest centers and association forests as well as  forest care associations: Forest organizations' obligation to  promote the diversity of forest wildlife would be written into  the laws. The organizations would be responsible for furthering  care of the environment in connection with practical forest  management and for monitoring them in cooperation with  environment officials. To go into effect in 1996.    Forest damage prevention law: Those who gather wood in the  summer would be obligated to avoid turning over roots, which  decays spruce thickets. Forest contractors would have to pay  forest owners compensation for any damage they cause while  harvesting trees starting with 1996. The committee wants to ban  excessive cleaning up of forests so that some decaying trees  will be left in forests.  <H5>  National Policy </H5>   The environment program for the forest economy was drafted  within six months, faster than anyone would have thought  possible. International agreements signed by Finland and the  forest industry's ability to compete on markets in which  emphasis is laid on sound ecological practice are behind the  Agriculture Minitry's speedy action.    Diversity must be included in ministry programs and laws  since Finland committed itself to promoting diversity in its  forests at the environment conference in Rio and at the  conference of forestry ministers in Helsinki.    Committee chairman Juhani Viitala hoped that the program  would receive some measure of official support from the  government. It will be easier for us Finns to demand that others  make changes in the ways they exploit their forests if our own  laws and guidelines are in order.    On the committee were representatives of, among others, the  forest industry, the National Board of Forestry, Tapio, the MTK  [Forest Industry Association], the National Boards of Waters and  Environment, and the Nature Conservation League. Ten of the 12  members of the committee were foresters.    In addition to official Nature Conservation League member  Esko Joutsamo, the committee also heard a great deal from Nature  League, World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), and Greenpeace  activists at different points of their deliberations.    The committee's unanimous proposal will now go through a  rapid round of circulation for comment. The Environment  Ministry's forest conservation strategy, which concentrates on  protected areas and restoration problems, among others, instead  of commercial forests, will be presented next week.</p>

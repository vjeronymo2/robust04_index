			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Japan household spending slips 4.3% in March Household spending in Japan slipped 4.3 per cent in March, the worst year-on-year decline since 1981, the government's management and co-ordination agency announced yesterday. This is the second month of spending decline, a worrying reversal of a four-month run of increases in household spending to the end of January. It is likely to cast doubt on Japan's chances of an imminent consumer-led recovery and increase pressure on the Bank of Japan to reduce its official discount rate to give the flagging economy a psychological lift, economic analysts said. The official rate, at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, has stood at a record low of 1.75 per cent since last September. Yesterday, it stood a mere 0.3 percentage points below the overnight money market rate, at which commercial banks lend to each other. This leaves the Bank of Japan little room to guide short-term money market rates - already at a record low  -down further, unless it cuts the official rate. Agency officials argued that part of the March spending decline was caused by delays in car purchases, ahead of a fall in car sales tax in April. Its own survey also shows a 0.4 per cent decline in wage-earners' real incomes in the year to the end of March, the first such drop for 13 years. Bonuses (a large part of annual wages) and wives' income from part-time work both declined, the agency said. Spending on food, furniture and clothing fell; households spent more on housing, utility charges and medical care. Household spending for the year to March fell by 0.6 per cent in real terms, in line with calendar-year figures released two months ago. This was the first time in 30 years spending fell for two fiscal years running. A slight pick-up in the third quarter evaporated in the final three months of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vasiliy Belousov] </F>   [Text] Murmansk, 9 Apr -- The ITAR-TASS correspondent has  managed to find out the details of the emergency which occurred  early this morning at one of the military cantonments of the  Northern Fleet.    Press center workers and fleet staff officers said that  armed  sailor Dmitriy Pulkin, who is serving under contract in a  counterintelligence sub-unit of the Federal Counterintelligence  Service, killed four people and injured three sailors. At 0355  hours he switched off the signaling in the armory room and stole  two submachineguns with six full drum magazines and five  pistols. Then he went down into the quarters of the duty  officer for a large unit of submarines and shot him with the  submachinegun. Next, he entered the quarters where the  submariners were resting and opened fire on them. One sailor  was killed and two were wounded. Seizing the unit commander's  driver, the criminal forced him to take the wheel. The latter  managed to get away for a few minutes into the barracks where he  reported the emergency to the duty officer of the naval  headquarters. Realizing his mistake, the criminal himself took  the wheel and set off for the military town. However, by that  time, the road was blocked by two fire engines, and Captain  Dudakov of the counterintelligence services drove towards him.  He tried to detain the criminal who opened fire with a  submachine gun and killed both the officer and his driver.    Breaking away from his pursuers, Pulkin reached a torpedo  retriever boat on which a seaman from his own district of  Pereslavl-Zalesskiy was serving. The criminal shot him dead and  took the other four members of the crew hostage. All Pulkin is  demanding from the representatives of the naval command and the  counterintelligence services, who are talking to him about his  surrender, is vodka and cigarettes.</p>

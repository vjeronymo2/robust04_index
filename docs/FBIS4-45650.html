			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with A. M. Dorofeyev, chairman of Belarus State </F> Ecological Committee, by A. Larin; place and date not given: "A  Man of Action. If I Survive Until My Pension"]    [Text] Look at the photograph. It shows the transfer of  power of the chairman of the CIS Interstate Ecological Council  (MES). Timofey Fomich Yanchuk, MES executive secretary is on the  left, Askhad Sharipovich Khabibulayev, chairman of the  Uzbekistan State Committee on Nature is on the right. Anatoliy  Maksimovich Dorofeyev, chairman of the Belarus State Ecological  Committee is shown in the middle. Presently the coordination of  environmental preservation work in his native post-Soviet space  is concentrated specifically in his hands. It is a complicated  global task. In addition to that it is painstaking and intensive  work in Belarus itself. Anatoliy Maksimovich has already been  occupying this post for 3.5 years. Before that he did scientific  work (an ornithologist by profession), taught and occupied the  post of prorector at the Vitebsk Pedagogical Institute.  According to Anatoliy Maksimovich himself it is very difficult  for a person with his background to become an administrator. In  my opinion, however, the Belarus State Ecological Committee was  very fortunate with regard to its chairman. In his leisure time  Anatoliy Maksimovich conducts ecological and regional studies  and loves museums. Among the ones he visits most frequently are  the Moscow State University Zoological Museum and the zoological  museum on Vasilyev Island in St. Petersburg. It is remarkable  when environmental protection work is managed by a person who  loves and appreciates nature not only during working hours or  because of the post he occupies.    Larin: Tell us please about the basics of the  environmental protection strategy of the Republic of Belarus.    Dorofeyev: I am impressed with the viewpoint held  by Albert Gora to the effect that the entire economy should be  "green." It is clear, however, that this is something that will  be possible only in the distant future. Meantime, while we are  shifting to a market economy what is most important is  introduction of an economic mechanism for the protection of the  environment. In many respects it has already been implemented. A  law on the ecological tax was introduced back in November 1991.  The nonbudgetary environmental protection fund was restored (60  percent of it remains at the rayon level, 30 percent goes to the  oblast, and 10 percent to the republic). Laws concerning  protection of the environment and a commission of ecological  experts have been adopted. They were received quite well by the  specialists. The law on industrial and consumption waste was  adopted quite recently, in November 1993, the law on specially  protected natural territories was adopted in its first reading.    Larin: As far as I know there is no law on waste  anywhere in the CIS.    Dorofeyev: Probably not. All of us hastened to  rewrite it. That is the usual practice in relations. Whoever  does it first, he will share with all. The law on protection and  rational utilization of the animal and vegetable world was  worked out in detail. It was highly praised at the Institute of  Environmental Protection in Frankfort on the Main. On the whole  it is planned to adopt 16 laws in the sphere of protection and  utilization of natural resources. Many would like to see strict  maximalist laws. But as long as we live in a transitional  period, the laws will also be of a transitional nature.    Larin: Anatoliy Maksimovich, one of the most  painful issues concerns finances.    Dorofeyev: I cannot shout "Hurrah!" for the  financing that we receive. Some 1.5 percent of the budget goes  for ecology plus a certain part of all capital investments. The  total amounts to 2.5 percent. I am pleased with the tendency  toward an increase in expenditures on ecology. Even though thus  far there is no improvement in the situation and we have no  right to expect one in the next two to three years.    Larin: How are your relations with the ecological  press?    Dorofeyev: We have kept the magazine RODNAYA  PRIRODA afloat. All of its founders abandoned it. But we carried  it out on our shoulders. The newspapers EKOLOGIYA MINSKA and  EKOLOGICHESKIY VESTNIK published in Gomel, also appear in the  republic. We are planning the publication of an applied science  magazine on environmental protection.    Larin: Recently our newspaper informed me that a  second "green" party, in addition to the Ecological Union,  appeared in Belarus. What kind of relations do you have with it?    Dorofeyev: I have had no discussions with the  second "green" party. The Ecological Union has a more practical  tilt to it. They do not substitute political posturing for  actual work. They are more concrete, which I like. The  development of the "green" party can take place only around that  pivotal point.    Larin: At present there is a lot of talk about the  forthcoming unification of the monetary systems of Russia and  Belarus. What is your opinion on this?    Dorofeyev: Unification of monetary systems does  not mean unification of the economies. I like cooperation with  the Russian Federation at an international level, in part,  within the MES framework. The value of our ecological alliance  with Russia lies in the possibility of utilizing the  intellectual and economic potential of each other.    Larin: How are your relations with the Ministry of  Nature of Russia developing?    Dorofeyev: I worked when Vorontsov was there and  know many people. The relations that formed are unselfish in  many regards. Viktor Ivanovich Danilov-Danilyan sometimes offers  intellectual help by sending his specialists which we do not  have. At the next MES session, which will take place in Moscow  in May, I will be transferring the chairmanship over to him.    Larin: After the election of Mechislav Ivanovich  Grib as chairman of the Supreme Council, a number of my  colleagues have been criticizing him with considerable delight.  Does he deserve that?    Dorofeyev: No. I can say that Mechislav Ivanovich  is a person who is very decisive with a good grasp of the  situation which has formed in the republic. I have known him for  a long time since Vitebsk, but not closely. It is necessary to  give him his due. He is a good jurist, a skilled legal expert,  and he will not permit any deviations from the law. Something  else. He is having to work in a very difficult time.    Larin: Are you referring to Vitebsk?    Dorofeyev: Yes. I have gone through practically  all of the literature on the history of Vitebsk area. I love to  visit the homeland of the father of Belarus literature Jan  Borshevskiy. If I survive until my pension I must write a book  about the history of the native area, its nature.    Larin: Anatoliy Maksimovich, our issue will appear  by 8 March.    Dorofeyev: I would like for our ecological  movement to do everything possible in order to promote the  health of women. Nature is vital to life. In protecting it we  will improve the life of all women in Russia and Belarus.</p>

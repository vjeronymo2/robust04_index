			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Moscow pledge on reforms to win IMF loan THE RUSSIAN government and central bank will make a joint statement on Thursday pledging to push forward economic reforms in order to qualify for a Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.9bn) loan from the International Monetary Fund, the country's finance minister said yesterday, writes Leyla Boulton. Mr Boris Fyodorov said the declaration would be followed by an application by the IMF to its board of directors for the release of Dollars 3bn under a new systemic transformation facility designed to help countries switch to a market economy. But rather than being an official IMF procedure, the statement appears to be an attempt by Mr Fyodorov to make reform promises as binding as possible on the rest of the government. He hoped the government, which includes a number of conservatives who are senior to him, would for instance pledge to abstain from new spending decisions for the rest of the year. Mr Fyodorov and the IMF fear a repetition of last year's scenario in which Russian authorities, including the present central bank governor, signed a statement of intent in order to receive a first Dollars 1bn loan from the IMF but never fulfilled its contents. Asked why the IMF should release the money this time, Mr Fyodorov, who only two weeks ago complained the Russian president was not pressing ahead with radical reform, said at least Russia was not moving backwards. 'Maybe there is no rapid movement, but there is a movement forward which deserves trust,' he said. For example, he said, he was successfully cutting budget expenditure in spite of a deputy central bank governor's statement to the contrary.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Vladimir Pasyakin, Sergey Prokopenko, and </F> Anatoliy Polyakov: "Clear Weather in the Crimea for Now, But  the Barometer Is Inclining Toward the `Storm' Mark. Politics Is  Not A Weather Forecast. There Must Be No Mistake"]    [Excerpt] The situation in the Crimea remains rather  complex. Let us recall that the political situation here has  exacerbated in recent days in connection with the adoption by  the Republic of Crimea parliament of a law on the restoration of  the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992, which provides for great  autonomy for the peninsula in relations with Ukraine. This step  has been assessed in official Kiev as separatism and a threat to  Ukraine's territorial integrity. A number of pretty  hard-hitting statements ensued. A "war of edicts" has begun,  whereby Kiev revokes the Crimean Supreme Council's decisions and  the Crimean parliamentarians react "appropriately" to Kiev's  decisions.    On the morning of 23 May General Major Valeriy Kuznetsov,  minister of internal affairs of the Republic of Crimea,  commented on the situation for KRASNAYA ZVEZDA as follows:    "The outward situation is calm, but people are tense in view  of the ambiguity of the situation. What is needed is for  everything to be decided at a political level, for us, a power  structure, not to get dragged into political squabbles, and for  the opinion of the people to be heeded, including that of  officers of the internal affairs organs. The national guard's  forces are continuing to grow in the Crimea."    It has become known that at 2300 hours on 22 May, 12  railroad  flatcars arrived in Simferopol carrying 29 Ukrainian Army  armored personnel carriers. The armored vehicles were dispersed  in various parts of the city. A report to this effect was made  by Petr Chernyatevich, the Crimean president's adviser on  military questions.    In his words, on the same day yet another attempt was made  to  get into the Crimean MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] building  by a group of Ukrainian MVD officers who, according to the  directive of their minister, had been appointed to various  leading posts in place of their Crimean colleagues. However,  the building's guards prevented this. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Singapore opens telecom service Singapore is to liberalise the resale of public switched telecommunication services from next month. The Telecommunications Authority of Singapore (TAS) will allow companies to buy telecommunications services from Singapore Telecom, which dominates telecom and postal services on the island, and resell these services to their customers, Mr Leong Keng Thai, TAS policy director, told a news conference. The aim was to maintain Singapore's competitiveness. Public switched telecommunications services include international direct dialling and subscriber trunk dialling calls as well as data services such as facsimile and electronic mail. The liberalisation of resale will introduce competition at the retail level for services currently under Singapore Telecom's exclusive licence, Mr Leong said. TAS had asked the company to develop a bulk discount scheme under which any reseller who has annual billings of a minimum SDollars 150,000 (Pounds 65,000) would enjoy discounts ranging from 2 per cent to 8 per cent. TAS will first license the reselling of telecommunications services by hotels and service apartments from January 1 next year, he said. Those enterprises are already resellers of services through commercial arrangements with Singapore Telecom. TAS, in consultation with the Singapore Hotel Association will also cut hotel and service apartment phone surcharges from April 1, 1995, Mr Leong said.</p>

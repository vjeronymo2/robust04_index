			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Special dispatch": "Zhu Rongji Says Problems Regarding </F> Practical Work During Transition Period in Hong Kong Should Be  Solved as Quickly as Possible"]    [Text] Beijing, 31 May (TA KUNG PAO) -- State Council Vice  Premier Zhu Rongji said today that the Chinese side very much  hopes that some practical issues in Hong Kong can be solved as  quickly as possible during the transition period and the impact  of political factors can be minimized, so as to ensure Hong  Kong's ability to retain its position as a banking and trading  center in the Asia-Pacific after 1997. Therefore, the Chinese  side maintains that matters which are not directly connected  with politics should be handed to the Sino-British Joint Liaison  Group for deliberation as soon as possible, where a solution can  be pursued.    This remark was made to reporters by Cheng Ming-fun, head of  the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce board of directors delegation  to Beijing, after meeting with Zhu Rongji this afternoon.    Cheng Ming-fun said: At the meeting, Zhu Rongji pointed out  that overseas personalities have been paying too much [guo fen  6665 0118] attention to the overheated development of China's  economy. Zhu Rongji said: The scale of the large  infrastructural projects that China conducted last year had  virtually no match in the world. These projects included the  construction of 2,000 km of railways and highways, the laying of  15 million new telephone lines, and the increase of electric  energy production by 15 million kilowatts. As a result of the  fast pace of development, economic overheating naturally  occurred. However, initial results have been achieved through  the implementation of macroregulation and control measures which  began last year. For example, the growth rate of capital  construction was reduced from 70 percent in the year 1992-1993  to 20-30 percent in the year 1993-1994; the exchange rate of  renminbi was kept at the level of 8.7 yuan to one U.S. dollar;  and the growth rate of the money supply was lowered from 100  percent in 1992 to 20 percent in 1993. Besides, since the  tax-sharing system was introduced at the beginning of this year,  the total tax revenue has increased by 22 percent. These  figures are a clear indication that China's banking and  financial sectors are moving toward stability.    Cheng Ming-fun said that Zhu Rongji's briefing has boosted  his confidence in China's economic environment and he believes  now is a golden time for investing in China.    Also, earlier today, the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce board  of directors delegation to Beijing met separately with the  persons in charge of the China Council for the Promotion of  International Trade and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade  and Economic Cooperation, exchanging views on economics, trade  issues, and most-favored-nation trade status.</p>

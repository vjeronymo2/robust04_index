			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed GGD: "NATO Air Forces Participate in </F> `Central Enterprise' Exercise"]    [Text] Brussels, 14 June (BELGA) -- NATO Air Forces in  Western Europe began a major annual exercise on Monday [13 June]  that will end on Friday, military sources report.    Known as "Central Enterprise," this maneuver involves  German,  Belgian, Danish, Italian, Netherlands, Spanish, and U.S.  aircraft and pilots, the allied air forces' Ramstein  headquarters in Center-Europe has announced.    France, which is not included in NATO's integrated military  structure, is taking part in the exercise "in the framework of  the normal training relations" it maintains with its allies, the  same source stated in a communique.    This is thus the first time that nine countries are taking  part in a "Central Enterprise," including Denmark (which has  been part of the so-called Center-Europe region since 1 January)  and Spain.    For the occasion, U.S. F-15 fighters have been dispatched to  France, the first time this has happened since it withdrew from  NATO's integrated military structure in 1966. These aircraft  are based in Cambrai (north), a French Air Force spokesman  indicated.    The NATO communique states that the exercise zone will  extend  over the Benelux countries, Denmark, certain areas of Germany,  northern and central France, the Baltic, and eastern Great  Britain.    Due to political and military change in Europe in recent  years, "Central Enterprise" will involve significantly fewer  daily flights than on previous occasions, the communique states.  The communique ends by stating that planes will fly during the  day only and the exercise should not mean any more activity in  the air than during a normal training day.    Some 300 U.S. reserves and nine C-130 "Hercules" transport  planes were dispatched to Chievres (between Mons and Ath) last  Sunday for a period of almost two weeks ending on Friday. These  pilots belong to the National Guard (reserve).</p>

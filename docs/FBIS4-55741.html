			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Emil Bajanek: "First Slovak; A New Pistol for </F> the Slovak Army"]    [Text] In the second half of the year, the range of  short-barreled small arms on our market will be extended with a  9-mm pistol, the model PS 93 Parabellum, manufactured by the  Povazske Strojarne [Vah Valley Engineering Works] a.s. at  Povazska Bystrica. This individual automatic weapon is intended  for firing at targets within a range of 50 meters, but it can be  used for firing at more distant targets, as well. The pistol  has a 15-cartridge magazine.    Engineer Dusan Melioris, director of the Povazske Strojarne  Research Institute, says that this top-quality product builds on  the company's production of small firearms that was discontinued  in 1954. The Army of the Slovak Republic currently does not  have a pistol of this caliber in its arsenal. The weapon had  been developed for sports shooting, particularly for combat  shooting enthusiasts. The well-balanced pistol is distinguished  by its extraordinary precision. The most up-to-date technical  methods have been applied in its design. The pistol has a  locked breech system [uzamknuty zaverovy system] and the  automatic repeat function is secured by a short recoil of the  barrel. The pistol has a push-pull triggering mechanism  [mechanizmus napinania bicieho kohuta pistole je dvojcinny] and  is equipped with a manual safety catch, and, after the last  cartridge has been fired, the breech mechanism becomes locked in  the rear position, says Melioris. From the head of the Research  Institute's Technical Department, we have learned that once  production reaches full capacity, some 300 employees will be  involved in the implementation of this supplementary production  program of Povazske Strojarne. He also mentioned that,  following the federation's partition, the development of the  pistol was not without certain hitches.    Povazske Strojarne will exhibit the pistol model PS 93  Parabellum in several modifications at the specialized IDET  [expansion unknown] exhibition in Brno at the beginning of June.  In cooperation with the Syndicate of Slovak Journalists and the  Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, the manufacturer is  preparing a demonstration of the weapon on 8 June. The  demonstration will take place in the Turecky Vrch military  training compound.    During our visit to Povazske Strojarne, our hosts also  acquainted us with the first Slovak pistols equipped with an  optical or laser direction finder. The creatively designed  wood-lined butt attracted our interest because it is perfectly  adjusted to the anatomy of the hand and is a comfortable fit.  Povazske Strojarne will also be manufacturing ammunition for  the pistol. Until recently, local engineers produced some 50  different types of cartridges.</p>

			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> Responding to performers' concerns heightened by the murder of actress Rebecca  Schaeffer last month, the California section of the Screen Actors Guild  National Board of Directors has voted unanimously to support proposed state  legislation that would make it harder to obtain private home addresses from the  Department of Motor Vehicles. SAG president Barry Gordon and guild executives  met with Assembly Speaker Pro-Tem Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles). Roos, who proposed  the legislation, will introduce the bill after the Assembly convenes on  Monday.The bill would allow any citizen to file a request from home-address  confidentiality with the DMV, which currently provides addresses to the public  for a nominal fee. Only law enforcement officials would have access to the  addresses. Claudia Puig  </P></p>

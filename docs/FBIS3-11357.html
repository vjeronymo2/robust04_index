			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucia Domville] </F>   [Text] Mexico intends to extend its policy of custom tariff  eliminations for sensitive agricultural products negotiated  under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to the 118  member countries of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade  (GATT).    Custom tariffs will remain greater for products such as  fresh  cheese, grapes, coffee, wheat, and cigarettes than those agreed  upon at the multilateral level, a policy which is intended to  protect national industry.    Sources close to the Commerce and Industrial Development  Secretariat (Secofi) have said despite the commitments decided  during the Uruguay Round of agreements, there will be no  negative impact on the Mexican agricultural sector, because  nearly 80 percent of the trade in this area is with the United  States and Canada.    The Uruguay Round of negotiations, which concluded on 15  December, were incorporated into the text of the Free Trade  Agreement between Mexico, the United States, and Canada.    Experts on the issue have said despite the fact the  multilateral negotiations were less in-depth than the ones that  took place at the trilateral level, Mexico had to compromise on  deregulating agricultural products included in NAFTA. This  means as of 1 January 1995, when the World Trade Organization  (WTO) [Organization Mundial de Commercio] is scheduled to become  effective, any of the 118 GATT member countries will be able to  export sensitive agricultural products to Mexico if they decide  to pay the custom tariffs.    Goods which for years were protected as part of the  country's  national development strategy and are now open to international  trade include: corn, beans, malt, barley, poultry, turkey,  animal fat, and potatoes. The negotiated tarrifs, despite  Mexico's opposition to tax sensitive products, fluctuates  between a minimum of 128 percent for barley and 282 percent for  animal fat.    The only agricultural products for which Secofi negotiators  were able to ensure tariffs greater than those granted to the  United States and Canada as part of the NAFTA agreements  include: fresh cheese, with 139 percent, which in NAFTA was  downgraded to 40 percent; grapes, 50 percent, up from 20 percent  in NAFTA; coffee, with 80 percent, up from 20 percent in the  free trade agreement; wheat, 74 percent, up from 15 percent  during the trilateral agreement; and cigarettes, 75 percent, up  from 50 percent during the trade pact.    This means implementation of noncustom tariff barriers  despite Mexico's opposition along with Canada, Korea [north or  south not specified], and Japan. In exchange, Mexico was able  to incorporate all NAFTA agricultural quotas as part of its  commitments with GATT.    The reduction in agricultural products, which will allow an  increase in agricultural exports from third countries to Mexico,  are not expected to hamper national industry, because the basis  for trade transactions will take place as per consolidated  tarrifs, not according to applied tariff levels. Mexico has  consolidated tariff totals by 50 percent, while applied tariff  levels fluctuate between 10 and 20 percent.    According to GATT estimates, world trade between 1985 to  2000  is forecasted to grow by 12.4 percent, an estimated increase in  the world's annual gross national product totaling $230 billion.    Mexico negotiated the Uruguay Round as part of a bloc of  developing countries, although individually was able to ensure  agricultural tariff concessions from Switzerland, Australia, the  Soviet Union, Japan and the Nordic countries.    Switzerland decreased its importation of Mexican products  such as natural honey, melons, papayas, avocados, skins of  citrus fruits, and cotton by more than 36 percent.    Australia cut its importations of frozen strawberries,  frozen  orange juice, rum, and taffia by more than 20 percent.    On average, the European Union decreased its importation of  goods such as natural honey, coffee, tobacco, avocados,  safflower oil, guava jelly, mangoes, frozen broccoli, horse  meat, roses, gladiolus flowers, carnations, frozen orange juice,  pineapples, papaya, and mushrooms by 31 percent.    Secofi sources believe Mexico is in a position to increase  its international market share in sectors that have definite  competitive advantages such as textiles, garments, agricultural,  food, and beverage products.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Hitotsubashi University Professor Takatoshi Ito </F> and Tokyo University Professors Motoshige Ito, Kazuo Ueda, and  Masahiro Kawai; from "Economic Class" column -- "U.S. Demand for  Setting Numerical Targets Runs Counter To Promotion of  Competitiveness"]    [Text] 1) At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks, the  United States has demanded that Japan set "numerical targets"  for Japan's imports of specific goods and services and a share  of foreign goods on the Japanese market. But the U.S. demand is  a dangerous means that could lead to managed trade and the U.S.  Government should withdraw the demand. We propose that the  Japanese Government carry through its policy of absolutely  opposing "numerical targets."    2) We are fully aware that Japan has the task of changing  distribution business practices on the Japanese market, allowing  more foreign access to the market in several sectors, relaxing  bureaucratic regulations, simplifying the procedures for license  and approval of new goods and services, and strengthening its  general competitive policy. We believe that the U.S. choice of  sectors for numerical targets is highly doubtful. Using  numerical targets as a means to achieve a specific goal will  precipitate a cartel among enterprises and strengthen the  oversight authority of government ministries and agencies. As a  result, numerical targets will backfire.    3) At bilateral negotiations and to the world, the Japanese  Government should put forth a vision of how it plans to narrow  price differentials between Japan and other nations, strengthen  the Antimonopoly Law's enforcement, and what it plans to do with  the Japanese economy.  <H5>  Numerical Targets Have No Economics Basis </H5>   At the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks presently under  way, the United States has raised the issue of the closeness and  intransparency of the Japanese market that stem from  bureaucratic regulations and conventional business practices,  and has asked Japan to increase imports and foreign access to  the Japanese market.    To that end, the United States has pressed the Japanese  Government and enterprises to set numerical targets for several  sectors and businesses and to make a commitment to them.    There are many problems with the Japan-U.S. economic  framework talks. However, the U.S. demand for setting numerical  targets for three priority sectors has no economic grounds at  all. Any attempt to use numerical targets as a means to settle  trade disputes will do more harm than good to the interests of  Japan and the healthy development of the world trade system.    So far, the Japanese Government has taken a passive attitude  in negotiations with the United States. The Japanese Government  has repeatedly decided to yield to U.S. demands, which, in an  effort to avoid short-term frictions with the United States, has  resulted in long-term damages to Japan. This are responsible  for the latest U.S. demand for setting numerical targets. In  handling the latest U.S. demand, the Japanese Government should  not repeat its past mistakes by yielding to the U.S. demand that  holds no economic rational.    Is it all right for Japan to simply say "no" to the U.S.  demand for setting the numerical targets?    We do not think so. Japan needs to listen to foreign firms'  criticism that "The Japanese market is closed and lacks  transparency." To regain the economic vitality and make the  life of Japanese consumers affluent, Japan needs to vigorously  implement new projects, develop new goods, and further relax  bureaucratic regulations. Japan should also exclude unfair  business practices that lead to bid-rigging.    We are fully aware that Japan is faced with the task of  changing the Japanese market's distribution business practices,  allowing more foreign access to the market in several sectors,  relaxing the bureaucratic regulations, simplifying the  procedures for license and approval of new goods and services,  and strengthening the general competitive policy. It is fully  expected that once this task is accomplished, access for newly  developed goods and services to the Japanese market will grow  and the imports of manufactured goods to Japan and their share  on the Japanese market in sectors in which foreign firms hold a  competitive edge will grow.    We, however, do not believe that in bilateral negotiations  with the United States, the discussion for something like "trade  results" and "managed trade," that aim for Japan's commitment to  foreign firms' access to the Japanese market, will be effective  in revitalizing and internationalizing Japan's economy.    Japan should announce to the world that it will relax the  bureaucratic regulations and adopt a thorough competitive policy  that will serve the Japanese economy and should put it into  effect without delay. To that end, Japan should adopt a new  economic policy. In a bid to reduce Japan's current account  surplus and open the Japanese market, the United States, during  bilateral negotiations, has asked that Japan set numerical  targets (for the share of foreign goods on the Japanese market  and the amount and number of American-made goods on the market).  This will lead to managed trade. The Japanese Government  should resolutely say "no" to the U.S. demand.    If both Japan and the United States agree on numerical  targets, the following problems will arise:    A) The act itself of the Japanese Government agreeing to  numerical targets would be interpreted as Japan acknowledging  "its difference from other nations." The act would reinforce  the assertions by anti-Japan hard-liners in the United States.  European nations and Australia would ask Japan for the same  bilateral agreements.    B) If Japan agrees with the United States on setting  numerical targets in a certain sector and the agreement is put  into effect, this would inspire the United States to claim: "Now  that the numerical targets are going well, let us expand them to  other sectors," and would demand that it be done. If numerical  targets are not met, it will spur the United States to assert  that "Japan has not lived up to its promise and we have no  choice but to slap sanctions against Japan."    C) Automobile and auto parts have become a priority sector  in  negotiations under the Japan-U.S. economic framework talks. The  primarily reason for a low share of American-built cars on the  Japanese market lies in the failure of American automakers to  manufacture cars that are salable on the Japanese market. The  U.S. demand for more sales of American-built cars on the  Japanese market holds no ground at all. The Japanese Government  should not step back from its position of opposing the U.S.  demand for setting the numerical targets in the automobile and  auto parts sector.    D) Further more, the United States has no economic reason to  push Japan for "numerical targets" in other sectors. Numerical  targets run counter to the desirable policy of relaxing  bureaucratic regulations and strengthening competitiveness.    E) If Japan devotes its time and energy to bilateral  negotiations with the United States and yields to U.S. demands,  this will have an adverse impact on Japanese and American  feelings toward each other by reinforcing America-dislike among  the Japanese and spurring Japan-bashing in the United States.  That would also taint Japan's image among Asian nations and  weaken Japan's leadership in multilateral negotiations.  <H3>  Japan's Conventional Response To U.S. Demands Inspires U.S.  To Make More Demands </H3>   The Japanese Government must reflect on the fact that its  conventional way of responding to U.S. demands has "encouraged"  the United States to make its latest demand for setting  numerical targets. The Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement  explicitly stipulates a target share of 20 percent of the  foreign semiconductors on the Japanese chip market. The  Japanese Government encouraged Japanese automakers to announce  their plans for the purchase of American-made auto parts when  former President Bush visited Japan in 1992. The Japanese  Government also agreed with the United States during the 1993  Tokyo summit that Japan would hold economic framework talks to  discuss the question of setting numerical targets, which the  United States had almost given up on at the time, and an accord  would be concluded between the two countries at the end of the  talks. This action was the Japanese Government's makeshift and  short-sighted concession to the United States without  considering long-term economic implications.    Given this history, it is quite natural that the view is  surfacing in the United States that if it threatens Japan with  "sanctions" and the "Super 301 provision of the 1988 Omnibus  Trade Act," Japan will go along with what the United States  demands. The United States imposed retaliatory tariffs on  Japanese-made semiconductors, citing Japan's breach of the 1987  Japan-U.S. Semiconductor Agreement and called Japan an unfair  trading nation based on the Super 301 provision of the 1988  Omnibus Trade Act. Japan "accepted" the U.S. trade sanctions  without taking its case to GATT. Japan-U.S. trade friction will  be defused in a short period, but the Japanese Government's  pusillanimous attitude will adversely affect Japan-U.S.  relations in the long run.    If Japan insists on saying "no" (to the U.S. demand) and  the United States takes hard-line measures (such as the revival  of the Super 301 provision and one-sided sanctions), it would be  possible for Japan to take such countermeasures as lodging a  protest, taking the case to GATT, or taking retaliatory  sanctions. Because the U.S. measures would be based on no  economic justification or GATT procedures, Japan could expect  sufficient political and public support for its protest or  appeal.    However, if sanctions are imposed on Japan unilaterally for  the reason that Japan cannot attain numerical goals after it has  agreed to set numerical targets, the justification for Japan's  insistence would be insufficient. In that case, the world's  economists, as well as the "pro-Japanese" and "free trade  supporters" in the United States, would take the view that  "sanctions against the violation of promises are necessary."    There are some cases in past trade negotiations between  European countries and the United States where the U.S.  "sanctions" failed to bring about effects or retaliatory  "sanctions" were imposed from both sides. As far as fair  arguments are exchanged, "sanctions" or "retaliation" would not  necessarily hurt a relationship of trust between the two  countries. When taking into consideration the contents of the  priority sectors in the ongoing economic framework talks, it  cannot be guaranteed that if the United States should move to  impose "sanctions" over the "automobile and auto parts" issue,  public opinion in the United States or other countries would  support it.  <H3>  Strenuous Efforts Should Be Made To Narrow Disparities  Between Domestic and Overseas Prices </H3>   Is it appropriate for Japan to only says "no" to the demand  for setting "numerical targets"? No, it is not. Japan, for its  sake, should tackle its own economic restructuring, independent  of bilateral negotiations.    What is necessary at first is to ease existing regulations  and to strengthen competitive policies. Deregulation will  create new business opportunities for domestic and foreign firms  which want access to new businesses and will revitalize the  market. This will be effective in invigorating the sluggish  economy.    Moreover, the living standard reflecting the economic  strength should be attained by adopting more consumer-oriented  policies. The fact that domestic consumers' purchasing power is  low because of the high prices for land and commodities has led  to criticism from countries abroad that Japan must be doing  something wrong or that it is dumping goods on foreign markets.  If deregulation is promoted and the economic structure that  fully satisfies consumers is established, most foreign criticism  against Japan will become meaningless.    As a matter of course, the disparities between domestic and  overseas prices should be narrowed through measures other than  setting "numerical targets." If competition is sufficiently  guaranteed in the distribution process, the differences between  domestic and overseas prices that must be dealt with will be  rectified automatically through market mechanism. In that  sense, easing regulations and strengthening competitive policies  (by cracking down on practices of soliciting price maintenance)  is of great significance.    To that end, the Japanese Government should not make (or  announce) a pledge in the bilateral negotiations, but rather,  should display (to the world) the future direction of the  Japanese economy. What is now being demanded is an effort to  rectify the differences between domestic and overseas prices, an  improvement of the social infrastructure, a strengthening of  competitive policies, and implementation of thorough measures to  deregulate the permission and authorization system -- for  example, cracking down on "dango" [illegal bid-rigging  practice], drastically easing regulations for setting up FM  radio stations, liberalizing air fares and route rights,  introducing competitive bidding, and assuring the freedom to  enter and withdraw from various industries.    The strategy that the Japanese Government should take at  present should be to indicate a long-term vision for  restructuring the Japanese economy while continuing to say "no"  to the demand for setting numerical targets. The Hosokawa  administration has been given a good opportunity to adopt a new  policy different from the past shortsighted policy toward the  United States. We expect the Japanese Government to display  strong leadership in promoting healthy development of the world  trade system, to promote constructive dialogue between Japan and  the United States, and to foster cooperation between the two  countries from the long-term viewpoint.</p>

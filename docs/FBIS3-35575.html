			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 30 January -- Russia has gone through the  period of inheritance from the Soviet Union which took place in  particular when relations between countries underwent so-called  complete normalization. At the present time, new relations have  been established between Russia and China, they have acquired  the nature of normal cooperation without the need for any kind  of "further steering together" of the partners. This was stated  by Andrey Kozyrev, Russian Federation minister of foreign  affairs, replying to questions put by the ITAR-TASS  correspondent on board the aircraft. The Russian minister  returned to Moscow last night after an official visit to China.    The minister pointed out the specific spheres of  Russian-Chinese bilateral ties, in particular the development of  cross-border relations, military-technical, and economic  cooperation. At the same time he noted the "extensive field  of unused possibilities" that also exists here.    The head of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said  that  possibilities exist for "harmonizing" the interests of two  great powers, Russia and China, both on a regional as well as on  a world level.    Speaking of the prospects for a democratic movement in  Russia, Andrey Kozyrev said that he does not think the  resignation of Yegor Gaydar was a "necessity." He reported that  he was very doubtful about this issue, something which he told  Yegor Gaydar in a conversation. "I respect his personal motives,  but from the point of view of the correlation of forces  following the elections in Russia and the prospects for a  democratic movement, I do not think that it was necessary to  take such a step, he should have tried to work in the government  and to defend his point of view," Andrey Kozyrev said. In his  opinion, what was needed was to promote the strengthening of the  democrats' position, especially after their relative defeat at  the elections.    The minister stressed that the President of Russia is at the  present time a uniting force, a guarantor of the reformist  transformations, during the implementation of which there are  bound to be temporary lapses. Nevertheless, Andrey Kozyrev  stressed that the deed had been done and he thinks that this  development of events will somehow act as an incentive for the  democrats to regroup somewhat.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "'Urayqat: Settlement and Peace Will </F> Never Meet; Solving Palestinian Problem Is Basis for Stability  in Region"]    [Excerpts] London, AL-QUDS AL-'ARABI -- A senior  Palestinian leader has warned that the peace process is  threatened with collapse as a result of the Israeli Government's  intransigence and refusal to seriously discuss the issue of  evacuating the settlements as a fundamental point in the file of  the bilateral negotiations between the two sides. He stressed  that the Palestinian leadership, which is discussing the demands  of its people, is fully aware that "settlement is a time bomb  which will explode in its face later unless it is defused  completely." And that the "U.S. Administration is responsible  for obstructing the peace process."    Dr. Sa'ib 'Urayqat, head of the negotiating Palestinian  delegation in Washington, said at a seminar in the British  capital during the evening of the day before yesterday that "the  Middle East problem did not begin between the Arabs and Israel.  It began inside Palestine. And without solving the Palestinian  problem there will be no solution in the Middle East."    He criticized the U.S. position on the Hebron massacre and  the U.S. Administration's threat to use its influence inside the  international organization to confront it if we insist on the  implementation of the UN resolutions. He added that he was in  Washington when the massacre occurred and that he held several  round of talks, but "President Clinton and his secretary of  state, Warren Christopher, failed to realize that the  perpetrator of the massacre is a settler and the main cause is  settlement."    Dr. 'Urayqat warned that "settlement and peace will never  meet," stressing that Washington alone can salvage the  negotiations, which were suspended after the massacre. He  criticized its international position of appeasing Israel,  accusing it of offering Israel preferential and biased treatment  by excluding Europe from the peace process and confronting  Russia, the co-sponsor of the negotiations. The Americans and  the Israelis are imposing their will on us, instead of sitting  with us to negotiate."    'Urayqat denied that the Palestinians demanded a solution to  the settlers issue only after the Hebron massacre. He said:  "The massacre made it a strong issue." He added that the  Israelis had always refused to discuss the settlements issue,  stressing that none of our fears would materialize."    The head of the Palestinian delegation to the Washington  negotiations added that "failure to include the settlement issue  on the negotiating agenda will inevitably lead to the death of  the negotiations, and the Israeli Government alone is  responsible for what settlers did and are doing."    He went on: "Even if our leadership decides -- under the  pressures to which it is exposed -- to join the negotiations  once again, the negotiations will die if this issue is not  resolved. And peace requires evacuating the settlers first,  otherwise any measure will be merely a measure to make the peace  process look prettier."    'Urayqat warned the U.S. Administration, the Europeans, and  any party interested in the success of the peace process that  "the failure of the peace process will not only affect the  Palestinians and the Israelis, but will have a regional impact."  'Urayqat accused the Israeli offers to end the effects of the  Hebron massacre of lacking seriousness. He said that "the offer  to disarm the settlers is not a serious one, because they are  all reservists and thus entitled to keep weapons in their  homes." [passage omitted]    He said that 72 settlers in Hebron are protected around the  clock by 1,400 Israeli soldiers. "So what sort of negotiations  do we wish to continue if the problem is not included on the  agenda." Addressing the Palestinian leadership, he said sorry,  but "the settlers remaining while Palestinian police forces are  deployed there would lead in the event of a massacre like the  Hebron massacre to one of two things:    "First, inhabitants killing settlers in retaliation,  resulting in Israel sending its aircraft to destroy 'Arafat's  headquarters and police centers;    "Second, inhabitants throwing stones at settlers, thus  initiating a whirlpool of successive reactions, taking us back  to square one."    He added: "We asked Rabin to settle his options, so he chose  settlement, domination, and the logic of force. Rabin is  supported by the U.S. Administration, the U.S. Army, and senior  U.S. envoy Dennis Ross."    'Urayqat admitted the Palestinians are faced with deep and  unprecedented difficulties and changes, saying that the Oslo  agreement is not a final peace agreement. He said: "The  agreement contains 63 clauses, none of which has a mechanism for  implementation and each needs an agreement of its own."    Asked about the disagreement with President Yasir 'Arafat,  'Urayqat stressed that he ['Arafat] "is a source of strength for  us, and we are not criticizing him. We realize he is merely a  human being like all of us." He added: "We want peace more  than any other people, but not at any price, because we will not  accept any solution seeking to reorganize the Israeli  occupation."    Palestinian figures who attended the seminar noted that Dr.  "Urayqat's speech reflected the view of the Palestinians inside  the occupied territories, who are urging 'Arafat to grant them  more powers as regards decisionmaking vis-a-vis peace and  negotiations.    'Urayqat said that Rabin "has the impression that he can do  anything without a deterrent in view of the U.S. solidarity and  the European silence -- which causes me to say that the peace  process is approaching its end. This has nothing to do with  optimism or pessimism. I just do not know whether or not the  process can continue." [passage omitted]</p>

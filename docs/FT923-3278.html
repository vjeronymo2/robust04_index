			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Opt-out school in cash crisis A FINANCIAL crisis in a grant-maintained school in Dorset has led to the suspension of the head teacher and the redundancy of seven teachers. Woodroffe School, Lyme Regis, has a deficit of more than Pounds 80,000, forcing the governors to suspend the head teacher last week after a vote of no confidence by the staff and an audit. Grant-maintained schools are not allowed to run deficits, and the Department of Education has the power to close them. Woodroffe, an 850-pupil comprehensive, opted out a year ago.</p>

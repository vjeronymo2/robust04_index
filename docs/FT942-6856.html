			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy fall for Shoprite The shock profits warning from Shoprite sent the shares crashing to end a tortuous session 54 down at 90p with turnover a hefty 2.5m. Dealers said they expected more pressure to come as investors, many of who came in at much lower levels, decide to take profits in one of the sector's best performing stocks. Analysts pointed out that the Shoprite tumble followed recent disappointments from other discounters such as Argyll's Lo-Cost arm, Nurdin &amp; Peacock and Kwik Save, and reinforced the market view that the discount end of the market was under severe pressure. Nurdin's was steady at 199p, while Kwik Save slipped a penny to 540p. Shoprite shares have climbed steeply since early 1991, when they stood at 20p, as the discount food retailer embarked on a big expansion strategy centred on southern Scotland. They hit 241p at the beginning of February since when they have retreated steadily, being particularly weak in recent sessions. Yesterday, the company was blaming stiff competition for the downturn in profits, with brokers halving their forecasts to around the Pounds 4.5m for the current year.</p>

			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Survey of World Economy and Finance - The World's Economies  -Europe (46): After Banesto, a period of hectic change - Tom Burns on the banking upsets It is hardly surprising that the press and other media should have concentrated so heavily on bankers and banks in Spain during 1994. Seldom can a domestic banking system have undergone such a change in so short a space of time. Over a hectic six months, the country's highest profile banker, Banesto chairman Mario Conde, left his job, a bevy of top Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, BBV, executives switched employers, and the power of Banco Santander chairman Emilio Botin increased greatly. A former Bank of Spain governor spent two weeks in jail and his successor gained an autonomy that other central bank heads, excepting the Bundesbank, might well envy. Mr Conde's departure from Banesto triggered Mr Botin's rise to become the nation's number one private banker. On December 28 last year, the Bank of Spain dismissed Mr Conde, together with his entire board, after its inspectors had discovered that it had grossly overvalued Banesto's assets, and on April 25 Santander's Mr Botin paid USDollars 2.05bn to acquire the troubled group in Spain's biggest domestic takeover. Cash-rich Santander outbid BBV to gain the Banesto prize and in so doing ruined its rival's ambitions to become the top Spanish bank. Mr Botin twisted the knife by hiring an entire BBV senior management team that had been seconded to run Banesto after its intervention in a caretaker capacity at the request of the Bank of Spain. Events were just as fast-paced at the Bank of Spain. At the same time as the Bank's governor Luis Angel Rojo was successfully concluding the Banesto rescue package by preparing a public auction in which Santander was to deliver its winning takeover bid, the headlines were devoted to a tax evasion scandal involving his predecessor Mariano Rubio. There was further irony in the approval by parliament of a Bank of Spain autonomy law on the very day when Mr Rubio was released from prison on surety of Dollars 72,500. Understandably, the politicians built in last-minute additions to the autonomy law that established strict rulings to prevent the illicit enrichment of the bank's officials. In line with the Maastricht treaty's provisions for central bank autonomy, Mr Rojo has the responsibility for setting monetary policy and becomes the effective guardian of price stability. The days when the governor was virtually nominated in rotation by the leading private banks are long gone and will never return. The more recent days when the governor was appointed by the government to bail it out of trouble are also over. Under the terms of the autonomy law, parliament votes the governor into the job for a six-year period and the Bank of Spain is prohibited from financing the treasury and other public institutions. The banking sector that Mr Rojo supervises is very different from the one that he first dealt with just two years ago when he succeeded the now disgraced Mr Rubio. The most visible change is that whereas before there were several leading domestic banks, each of which could claim superiority over the others in some area of the financial business, now there is the Santander-Banesto group and the rest. The takeover represents the culmination, at least for the time being, of a banking merger process that began in 1988 when Banco Bilbao and Banco Vizcaya joined forces to form BBV and continued three years later when Banco Central and Banco Hispanoamericano merged to form Banco Central Hispano, BCH. Subsequently the state-controlled banking institutions were pooled together under their flagship Banco Exterior to form Argentaria, a banking corporation which was partially privatised in 1993. Santander stood aside from the merger process and instead turned its attentions abroad, buying more than 20 per cent of First Fidelity in the US and acquiring a 10 per cent stake in Royal Bank of Scotland. It also built up its merchant banking unit, Santander de Negocios, now renamed Santander Investment, into a strong force in Latin America's emerging markets. At the time of the Banesto acquisition Santander's foreign-based business was responsible for close to 50 per cent of its healthy net annual profits. Santander's forceful return to Spain, where with one acquisitive stroke it has become the dominant parti-cipant in the domestic market, was foreshadowed by a series of aggressive strategies designed to weaken the margins of its rivals, and not least those of Banesto its eventual target. It introduced a high interest-bearing current account one year, an innovative unit trust savings scheme another year and a home loan product the next. Now that it has achieved the dominance it sought, San-tander looks destined to make a more lasting impact on the domestic sector by altering the traditional banking model in Spain, which, much on the lines of German institutions, involves close ties between the country's banks and its leading industries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report on an interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres </F> by Eyal Eisenstein on 20 March; place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Eisenstein] Last night, the Israeli delegation  began negotiations with senior PLO echelons in Tunis in  anticipation of the resumption of the peace talks. Foreign  Minister Shim'on Peres told us yesterday that the obstacles to  peace created by the Hebron massacre are not the last ones we  will have to overcome. At the same time, Peres expects the  negotiations to resume soon:    [Peres] I believe that official talks with the four parties  will resume in Washington in early April.    [Eisenstein] Peres said that the proposals conveyed by the  Israeli delegation to Tunis are the proposals of the Norwegian  representatives, with which the PLO is basically familiar.  Peres noted that the proposal to deploy Palestinian policemen  in Hebron is also on the agenda:    [Peres] We still have to work out this proposal. It is not  an exact repetition of the previous situation. We want  something that will also take into consideration the  sensitivities and concerns of the local residents. This force  must be under Israeli authority, however, because it is  inconceivable to have two military authorities in the same city.    [Eisenstein] Regarding Peres' scheduled meeting with 'Arafat  in Paris on 24 March, the foreign minister said the issue has  not been finalized.    [Tel Aviv HA'ARETZ in Hebrew on 21 March on page A1 carries  a  report by 'Aqiva Eldar on Peres' appearance before Labor  activists in Tel Aviv on 20 March, adding the following: "Peres  stated that Israel will not compromise on Jerusalem, which will  remain under Israeli sovereignty and is a 'closed case' from the  political point of view but remains open in terms of the  religious aspects."    [Writing on page 2 of Tel Aviv YEDI'OT AHARONOT in Hebrew on  21 March, Nehama Dowek reports on Peres' remarks on the same  occasion. She quotes Peres as saying: "We will not admit to not  having the right to live in all parts of Eretz Yisra'el. We  have that right, but the question is what sense is there in  exercising it." Peres added: "Goldstein's act raises questions  about the possibility of coexistence between settlers and Arabs.  The settlement of 400 Jews among 120,000 Arabs in Hebron  illustrates the magnitude of this problem. We must decide what  is the right solution. The settlement map must be a purely  Israeli decision rather than the result of pressure created by  the negotiations."]</p>

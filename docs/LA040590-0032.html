			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: VENTURA;  </P> <P> OFFICIALS IDENTIFY SPILLED SUBSTANCE  </P> <P> Three hundred gallons of a substance spilled near the Ventura Harbor last month  was identified Wednesday as a flammable, slightly toxic compound used in sewage  treatment, officials said.  </P> <P> The spill, under investigation by county prosecutors, has not been cleaned up,  said Carol Green, a Ventura city official.  </P> <P> Green said the city is still reviewing bids from two firms offering to clean up  the spill, which was first reported by the county Department of Environmental  Health on March 9.  </P> <P> The substance spilled is a polymer called Clarifloc C-310, a coagulant that  "conditions the sludge" and makes solids in sewage stick together to ease  filtration of impurities from waste water, said Daniel E. Rayburn,  superintendent of the nearby city waste-water treatment plant.  </P> <P> Rayburn said he has no information about the chemical properties of C-310 and  does not know whether any sewage was in the spill at 1400 Spinnaker Drive,  close to the treatment plant.  </P> <P> Green said the city's cleanup proposal first has to be approved by the  Department of Environmental Health, the Regional Water Quality Control Board  and state environmental agencies. The spill site is roped off but is not  accessible to the public, he said. MACK REED  </P></p>

			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / International Company News: DKB debt downgraded by S&amp;P STANDARD &amp; POOR'S, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded the debt ratings of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, a leading Japanese commercial bank. The move is the most recent in a line of credit downgrades for the big Japanese banks. They face increasing bad loans due as the prolonged recession pushes up the number of bankruptcies. DKB's senior debt rating has been lowered to 'single A plus' from 'double A minus' and the rating agency has lowered DKB's short-term debt rating to A-1 from A-1 plus. S&amp;P said increasing problem assets at the bank were hurting its asset quality. At the end of March, loans to bankrupt borrowers and loans six months past their due date totalled Y1,300bn (Dollars 12.3bn), or 3.81 per cent of outstanding loans. While Japanese financial authorities claim that bad loans at commercial banks average around 3 per cent of total lending, industry analysts reckon the figure rises to 10 per cent when measured in US terms.</p>

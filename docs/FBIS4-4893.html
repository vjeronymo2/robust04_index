			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 6 KYODO -- The North Korean parliament  convened Wednesday [6 April] and adopted three bills, including  the budget for fiscal 1994, Korea News Service reported.    The Tokyo-based news service, monitoring a KOREAN CENTRAL  NEWS AGENCY [KCNA] dispatch, said the Seventh Meeting of the  Ninth Supreme People's Assembly was convened with North Korean  President Kim Il-song, and his son and heir apparent Kim  Chong-il in attendance.    The new legislation included the execution of a socialist  economic readjustment period ordered in December by the Korean  Workers Party and the approval of laws adopted by the assembly's  Standing Committee during the assembly's absence.    The KCNA report made no mention of any policy initiatives as  international demands mount for Pyongyang to comply with nuclear  safeguards inspections and calls for economic sanctions against  North Korea continue to grow.    The report also gave no indication of any change in the  North  Korean leadership. Speculation has grown over when the dynastic  succession in Pyongyang may occur.</p>

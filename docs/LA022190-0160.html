			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT;  </P> <P> ECOLOGISTS DECRY SUNUNU POLICY  </P> <P> Environmentalists accused White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu today of  leading President Bush astray on environmental policy, specifically charging  Sununu with undercutting Administration efforts to protect wetlands, toughen  clean air laws and fight global warming.  </P> <P> In a letter to Bush, eight major environmental groups warned Sununu was  undermining Bush's campaign promises to the American public to be a strong  environmental President.  </P> <P> "Mr. President, you articulated laudable environmental goals, but it appears  your chief of staff is not committed to meeting them," the groups wrote.  </P> <P> The environmentalists asked Bush for an emergency meeting to "clarify the  direction in which you are headed on the environment."  </P></p>

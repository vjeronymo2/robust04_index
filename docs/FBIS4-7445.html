			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by S. Despot: "Turning Point in Relations Between </F> Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina"]    [Text] Zagreb -- "The most important achievement of the  Washington Agreement and its documents is that the conflict  between the Croats and the Muslims-Bosniaks, which was  artificial from the beginning, has been ended. The Washington  talks mark a turning point in global relations between Croatia  and Bosnia-Herzegovina with the signing of the preliminary  agreement on stronger institutional relations between the two  countries," said Ivo Komsic, member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Presidency and participant in the Washington talks, at a press  conference held at the Bosnia-Herzegovina Embassy.    Expressing hope that the Washington constitution of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation will be accepted on 28 March -- he  announced that the Bosnia-Herzegovina Assembly would convene  that day -- Komsic said it was supposed to become effective at  midnight on 29 March. The Constituent Assembly will be made up  of deputies elected at the 1990 elections, except for those  whose mandate had been canceled. The president and vice  president of the Assembly will also be appointed that day; one a  Muslim, the other a Croat. Apart from adopting the constitution  of the federation, the Assembly is also entrusted with passing  the election law for the forthcoming elections, which -- Komsic  hopes -- will be held in a couple of months.    According to Komsic, the importance of the Washington talks  lies in reaching the federation agreement according to the  principles laid down by the Sarajevo assembly held on 6  February, while the public of both countries will decide about  the question of a confederation between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina.  <H5>  There Will Be Resistance </H5>   "I am aware that some people will resist the implementation  of both agreements, both the one on the principles of the  federation and that on the confederation agreement, but I expect  the resistance to come from people who have been hindering the  negotiations between the two nations from the beginning," said  Komsic in reply to a question from the press, commenting on the  views of the Croats from the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna  that they will not accept the federation without firm ties with  Croatia. However, he said that he expects people only to hinder  the implementation, not to prevent it, for it was arranged at a  high level under the auspices of the United States, which has  finally become involved in solving the crisis on this territory  and it will not allow the agreement to fall through.    Asked whether the agreement was reached only as a result of  U.S. pressure, Komsic said that the U.S. Administration had been  restrained until the Croat-Muslim conflict broke out. It was  then that the United States decided to get involved in solving  the crisis and even go as far as -- unless there is another  possibility -- to accept a possible agreement between the  Croatian National Council and the Muslim-Bosniak leadership as a  basis to which further pressure on the warring factions could be  applied. "Fortunately, the Croatian authorities decided to make  an about-turn in their policies adopting solutions advocated by  the opposition," said Komsic, and added that the cantonal map  drawn up by the Sarajevo assembly was accepted.    "We agreed that central Bosnia will consist of two cantons,  neither of which will have a predominant nationality, just as  that kind of predominance was not planned in any other canton,  regardless of the majority nation," said Komsic, explaining that  the cantonal borders would be determined by expert groups.  <H5>  Herceg-Bosna Did Not Exist </H5>   He explained that the Croatian republic of Herceg-Bosna has  never existed, formally or legally speaking. During the war,  some institutions of authority were established without  legitimacy (which only the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina had  all the while), but with great political power. He said that it  was agreed that some institutions of the Croatian republic of  Herceg-Bosna will continue to function for another month after  the adoption of the constitution of the federation -- which will  refer to the entire territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina -- and that,  after that period of time, they should be abolished.    Asked how the Bosnian Serbs would be included in the  agreement, Komsic drew a distinction between loyal Serbs, who  will be involved in the political life of the federation, and  those in the occupied areas, who have not yet become involved in  the negotiating process. Asked about the chances of the  Croat-Muslim alliance attacking the Serbs, he said that the  agreement excluded the military option and it was devised on the  model of eliminating the causes of war. If the Serbs do not  accept the agreement, they will have to consider a series of  other possibilities and Komsic said it would be best to combine  diplomatic and military pressure, according to the Sarajevo  model.    He said that there is absolutely no chance of a union of the  Bosnian Serbs with Serbia, for that would mean destroying the  territorial integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Serbs, who  are aggressors both in Croatia and in Bosnia-Herzegovina, must  not be joined in one state as a reward. "We should not make any  concessions to the Serbs; they must be politically and  militarily defeated," said Komsic.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the press review] </F>   [Text] In its editorial today, TISHRIN stresses that Syria  adheres to the principle of comprehensive and speedy withdrawal  from the Golan Heights and the occupied territories as part of a  complete solution of all substantive issues that leads to an  honorable, genuine, durable, and firmly established peace in the  Middle East.    TISHRIN says that since the day the U.S. initiative was  launched, Syria has declared its rejection of partial, phased  settlements. These do not make peace, but only inflame regional  tension.    TISHRIN says the issue is not just the fact that the Golan  is  Syrian territory occupied by force in an aggressive,  expansionist war. There are also tens of thousands of Golan  residents who were forced to leave their homes and who still  await their return home. There is also the issue of the city of  al-Qunaytirah, which was completely destroyed by the Israeli  troops, and which awaits to be rebuilt. Therefore, it is  impossible to talk about a peace that does not include full  Israeli withdrawal, the return of the evacuees, and the  reconstruction of the region. Hence, the formula proposed by  Syria: Full peace in return for full withdrawal. Full peace  cannot be traded for partial withdrawal.    TISHRIN adds: What applies to the Golan also applies to  southern Lebanon. There are tens of thousands of displaced  people who are anxiously awaiting the withdrawal of the invading  Israeli troops in order to return home.    TISHRIN believes the Israeli rulers have a unique  opportunity  to engage in a durable and genuine peace. This would be through  responding to the Syrian ideas and the resolutions of  international legitimacy.    TISHRIN concludes: Israeli rulers fully know that regional  peace is impossible without Syria's effective participation, and  that Syria's effective participation is impossible without the  full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Golan and the return  of this Syrian territory to its owners.    Commenting on the same subject, AL-BA'TH says: What was  published and said about the Israeli proposals on the Golan  Heights during the past days, especially during Warren  Christopher's regional tour, has proved again that Israel's  course has nothing to do with the effort that is being exerted  to salvage the peace process.    AL-BA'TH adds: Vagueness is the common denominator among  recent Israeli officials' statements on the Rabin government's  proposals on the Golan. Therefore, their objective is to  circumvent the principles set at the Madrid conference.    AL-BA'TH says those proposals which were leaked by Israel to  coincide with the arrival of the U.S. secretary of state in the  region have nothing to do with the issue of a just,  comprehensive peace. At their best, just like the Gaza-Jericho  settlement, they consolidate Israel's policy of dividing the  political settlement and entrenching the occupation in its  various existing forms. According to Israeli officials, such  settlements achieve the objectives they failed to achieve in all  their aggressive wars against the Arabs.    AL-BA'TH says Syria works with absolute seriousness to  achieve a just, comprehensive peace based on the resolutions of  international legitimacy and on the basis of the Madrid formula.  Syria, the paper adds, believes Israel's policy on the peace  process remains unchanged. Apparently, this policy is  unchangeable and unalterable. This policy still rejects  commitment to the implementation of the resolutions of  international legitimacy.    AL-BA'TH refers to what leader al-Asad said during his  meeting with Christopher, when he stressed the need to tackle  basic issues. These issues are the essence of the conflict.  Their solution ensures progress in the peace process.    Concluding, AL-BA'TH says: More than two and one-half years  of talks in Washington, and other diplomatic efforts, have  proved that Israel is maneuvering, procrastinating, and evading  the implementation of the basic conditions and requirements of  peace, chiefly full withdrawal from Arab territories. In fact,  what Israel seeks are settlements patterned after the  Gaza-Jericho agreement. We reject such settlements. They are  not a substitute for the aspired peace.    AL-THAWRAH says progress in the peace process is conditional  on changing Israeli negotiating tactics and the commitment by  Tel Aviv's rulers to the resolutions of international legitimacy  and the UN Security Council and acceptance of the Madrid terms  of reference as a basis for a just, comprehensive settlement on  all fronts and tracks.    AL-THAWRAH says: So far, no one can see any substantive  change in the negative Israeli position and performance  regarding the political process or a single positive indicator  of change in that policy in the near future -- a policy of  aggressive options and continued occupation of Arab territories  and that stubbornly rejects all the bases of peace.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Based on what we have noted, Tel Aviv has  offered nothing new to facilitate the Christopher mission.  Everything it has proposed is only ideas and proposals, which,  according to Israeli papers themselves, are vague offers of  phased solutions that circumvent UN resolutions and do not  constitute a basis for a serious and genuine breakthrough in the  peace process.    On the other hand, what Christopher heard from President  Hafiz al-Asad and the ideas and proposals that he was asked to  convey embody the constants of the Syrian position, which  proceed from a real desire to establish a just, comprehensive  peace.    AL-THAWRAH stresses that Washington is required and  beseeched  to play an effective, impartial role to ensure respect for and  compliance with international legitimacy and to forcefully  impose their implementation on the obstructive party without any  delay and without any bias.    Concluding, AL-THAWRAH says: It is wrong to believe Syria  can accept any solution that does not meet its just demands or  ignores an iota of its national and pan-Arab rights and its  uncontroversial full sovereignty over the Golan. Piecemeal and  phased peace is rejected and unacceptable. Peace is impossible  without full Israeli withdrawal.</p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / EU steelmakers to appeal against Commission fines European steelmakers reacted angrily last night to fines of Ecu104.4m (Pounds 78.9m) imposed on 16 companies by the European Commission for allegedly operating a cartel in steel beams used in the construction industry. Mr Brian Moffat, chairman and chief executive of British Steel, said the company would be appealing against the decision, probably to the European Court of Justice. British Steel, seen by the Commission as one of the ringleaders, faces the heaviest fine of the 16 steelmakers - Ecu32m (Pounds 24.3m). Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, said: 'German steel companies will not accept this decision silently. They will instead defend themselves in front of the European Court of Justice and show that all principles of free competition have been respected.' The steelmakers are upset both by the timing of the decision and the judgment itself. Following dawn raids by the Commission's competition directorate in 1991, a judgment against the companies was made in 1992, but no fines were announced. One steelmaker says it had heard nothing from the Commission on the matter for a year until this week's 'controlled leak'. This threatened to add further controversy ahead of Tuesday's crucial meeting between heads of the big producers and the Commission. The industry clearly believes the leak was intended to put pressure on it to agree to much-needed capacity cuts. The Commission says that after 1988 - when the so-called manifest crisis regime in the industry ended - the industry was repeatedly told to cease cartel practices in beams and girders. The industry says it repeatedly sought guidance from the Commission on the legality of inter-company discussions. According to British Steel, from mid-1988 the Commission authorised a framework of market monitoring. The UK producer rebuts the Commission's comments on market sharing - it says it increased its deliveries of beams to Continental markets nearly eight-fold between 1986 and 1993. Mr Moffat said British Steel wanted the Commission to be given the authority to vet subsidy cases before the aid is granted rather than retrospectively as occurs now. He said the company would not contribute to the capacity cuts fund if the subsidies issue was not resolved satisfactorily.  --------------------------------         EU STEEL FINES  --------------------------------                              Ecu  -------------------------------- Arbed                      11.2m British Steel              32.0m Unimetal                   12.3m Saarstahl                   4.6m Ferdofin                    9.5m Thyssen Stahl               6.5m Preussag                    9.5m Ensidesa                    4.0m Aristrain                  10.6m Cockerill Sambre            4.0m NHM Stahlwerke           150,000 Krupp Hoesch              13,000 Svenskt Stal                  40 Inexa Profil                 600 Norsk Jernverk               750 Fundia Steel                   4  --------------------------------</p>

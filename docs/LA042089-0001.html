			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TURKEY FRANKS RECALL;  </P> <P> BACTERIAL INFECTION IS SUSPECTED  </P> <P> A Waco, Tex.,-based food company has voluntarily recalled all brands of its  turkey hot dogs -- many of which are sold in Southern California -- because of  suspected bacterial contamination, federal officials announced.  </P> <P> The action, involving Plantation Foods Inc., became necessary after laboratory  tests discovered the presence of Listeria monocytogenes in some of the firm's  processed meat products.  </P> <P> Contributing to the recall decision was a Listeriosis illness linked to  Plantation's hot dogs, federal officials state. A U.S. Department of  Agriculture representative said the current case marks the first time a  ready-to-eat meat product was associated with Listeriosis, a potentially fatal  infection.  </P> <P>  The company sells hot dogs under several different brand names including  Plantation Turkey Franks, NIFDA Turkey Franks, CODE Turkey Franks and Nugget  Turkey Franks. The products are sold in both one-pound packages in supermarkets  and in 10-pound packages to institutional food service operations. Distribution  of the affected items extends along a southern tier of states stretching from  Georgia to Southern California.  </P> <P> Uncooked hot dogs, as well as undercooked chicken, have been identified by the  Centers for Disease Control as high risk foods for potential Listeria  monocytogenes contamination. The pathogen has also been found in coleslaw, soft  cheese and other dairy products.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reevaluating Its Policy  </P> <P> Based on these findings, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has been monitoring  both beef and poultry hot dogs for the contaminant on a regular basis since  October, 1988. Under the program, manufacturers were given an opportunity to  clean up their plants, without a recall, if any of their products were found to  be contaminated with Listeria.  </P> <P>  As a result of the recent illness, however, the USDA is reevaluating its  policy, said Catherine E. Adams, Ph.D., with the Food Safety and Inspection  Service in USDA.  </P> <P> "It is likely that our policy will be substantially modified," Adams said. "The  premise had been that Listeria-contaminated processed meat had not caused human  illnesses, nor even been associated with human illness. But this is a confirmed  association (between hot dogs and) an illness."  </P> <P> Listeria monocytogenes was identified as the cause of more then 40 deaths,  mostly stillborns, from improperly manufactured Mexican-style soft cheese in  the Los Angeles area in 1985.  </P> <P> Those with weakened immune systems are considered to be at particular risk from  Listeria. Included in this group are infants, pregnant women, the elderly and  the chronically ill such as those suffering from cancer, AIDS and cirrhosis.  </P> <P> In fact, the woman who became infected in the recent incident was a 61-year-old  cancer patient.  </P> <P> Normally, healthy people are at little risk from Listeria. When an infection  develops, however, the symptoms typically include fever, chills, headache,  backache, abdominal pain and diarrhea. CDC estimates that there are about 1,400  Listeriosis cases annually in this country with a 35% mortality rate.  </P> <P> "This is a disease that effects certain groups of people and we are trying to  determine what recommendations to make to the public and to the food industry,"  said Anne Schuchat MD, medical epidemiologist with the CDC's meningitis and  pathogens branch.  </P> <P> The important issue in the Plantation Foods case is the presence of a harmful  bacteria in a ready-to-eat food. Although hot dog packaging recommends that  people thoroughly heat the frankfurters, some individuals eat them cold or  undercooked.  </P> <P> "The product -- hot dogs -- should be fully cooked by manufacturers and ready  to eat as is," said Adams. "That is also something that is being reviewed."  </P> <P> Another area of concern in the current case is that the victim heated the  turkey hot dog in a microwave oven.  </P> <P> "Maybe microwaves do not cook thoroughly enough to kill Listeria. This is an  area worth looking at and that is in (our) plans," said CDC's Schuchat.  </P> <P> USDA's Adams also said that the effectiveness of microwaves is something that  federal agencies, in general, need to explore in light of the recent  Listeriosis case.  </P> <P> "We didn't think the cold spots in food after microwaving created a significant  problem or a food safety problem. No agency did," she said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Closed for Three Days  </P> <P> Once the Listeria discovery was made, Plantation's hot dog production line was  closed for three days. The firm is now in the process of having the facility  recertified by USDA as being free from the contaminant, said Lacy Roane Jr.,  chief executive officer. None of the firm's other products are effected by the  recall, Roane said.  </P> <P> "Any (hot dog) they manufacture does not go out the door until it is analyzed  as containing no Listeria monocytogenes," said Adams.  </P> <P> USDA officials said that proper cooking of raw meat products as well as  thorough reheating of processed meats, such as hot dogs, is sufficient  protection from potentially harmful bacteria.  </P> <P> One meat industry representative said that the current recall and illness are  isolated incidents and are nothing that should alarm the public.  </P> <P> "The industry is concerned about this and will do its best to improve and not  allow it to happen again," said Stan Wallen, Ph.D., director of science and  technology for the National Turkey Federation in Reston, Va. "But this is an  extremely rare event."  </P> <P> Ready-to-eat foods such as hot dogs, Wallen said, are also closely regulated by  the government and offer more protection than raw items such as meats or  produce.  </P> <P> "We all assume that companies' pre-cooked foods are absolutely free of  pathogens. But in reality there are pathogens that find their way into  processed foods on rare occasions," he said.  </P></p>

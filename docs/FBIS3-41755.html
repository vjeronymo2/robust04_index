			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: ``Infected Meat Brought Into Moscow''] </F>   [Text] The other day, the city veterinary service seized a  batch of Belgian pork sausage meat. As its employees reported to  MOSKOVSKIY KOMSOMOLETS, more than 60 tonnes of sausage meat  intended for sale to Moscow residents was found infected with  life-threatening salmonellosis. The meat, which was purchased  abroad for a very low price, was shipped to the capital by a  commercial firm. The vacuum-packaged sausage meat could have  been sold through commercial booths as well as through stores by  direct contract.    In specialists' words, the lion's share of imported food  products being sold in the capital by direct shipment is  hazardous to Moscow residents' health. Veterinarians are most  afraid of meat products from Spain because the plague is now  raging in that country.</p>

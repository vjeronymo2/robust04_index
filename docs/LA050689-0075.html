			<p><P> May 6, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ANIMAL RIGHTS  </P> <P> May I quote: "Frankly, I don't shed a tear when I hear a lab has been broken  into." Me, too!  </P> <P> Hooray for animal rights groups! They speak up for the billions of animals  wasted by the "good old boy" researchers. Methinks the researchers, and their  system of grants, are nervous. Reminds me of Congress.  </P> <P> RUTH UNGER  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

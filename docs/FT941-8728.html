			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Arts chief to quit post a year early Mr Anthony Everitt will today announce his resignation as secretary-general of the Arts Council today - a year before the end of his contract. Mr Everitt said his resignation was not connected with recent disputes over cuts in funding for orchestras and theatres. He said he was returning to journalism and other projects. The move will coincide with the departure of Lord Palumbo as chairman of the council. Lord Palumbo is being replaced by former arts minister Lord Gowrie on April 1. He denied there was any friction between himself and Lord Gowrie.</p>

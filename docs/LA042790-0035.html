			<p><P> April 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLOTHESLINES  </P> <P> Q: I will be attending several formal events this spring and need a new evening  gown. What's new, and right for a 5-foot-6 38-year-old? I wear a 38-C bra so  don't suggest a strapless dress or one with a bustier as they only accentuate  my big bosom.  </P> <P>  -- P.A.W.  </P> <P> A: But that's what you're supposed to do this season. The most up-to-the-minute  look for evening is the hourglass figure. After years of exile, curves are once  more fashionable. It's a look right out of "Dangerous Liaisons" and one given a  big push -- and push-up -- by Paris designer Yves Saint Laurent (illustrated  here) in his latest haute couture collection. It could be the first fashion  trend ever inspired by plastic surgery.  </P> <P> If you don't feel comfortable in a bustier or strapless gown, look for one with  a scooped-out neckline.

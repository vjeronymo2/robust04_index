			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Stadi Varios Pounds 250m plan for Wembley A rival consortium, led by Stadi Varios, will apply on Monday for planning permission to reconstruct one of the world's most famous football venues, Wembley Stadium. The move will come in spite of the fact that the heavily indebted existing owner of the 'venue of legends', the Wembley company, is already holding a financial beauty parade for a restructuring which would enable it to retain its principal asset. The company's hold on Wembley stadium is being challenged by a consortium formed by a private stadium company Stadi Varios, which claims to have financing prepared for the Pounds 250m project. Mr Patrick Nally, who founded Stadi Varios, claims the stadium is 'well past its sell-by date'. He proposes to retain the twin towers, but put in place a 100,000 seater modern stadium, with a retractable roof to allow greater usage. Backed by a consortium including construction companies Tilbury Douglas and John Laing, it has offered Pounds 75m for the site, or a package 'substantially in excess of Pounds 100m' for the adjoining Arena and Conference Centre. However, Sir Brian Wolfson, chief executive of Wembley, said the company and its advisers had decided the proposals were 'unrealistic, and not in the best interests of shareholders'. The company has rebuffed all attempts by the consortium to enter negotiations. Sir Brian said the stadium carried a book value of around Pounds 90m, which would leave shareholders with a substantial book loss. However, the price is understood to be negotiable. After discussions with the Football Association, Brent Council, and some of Wembley's bankers, who are owed Pounds 140m, Mr Nally remains confident that it is viable. The consortium would raise funds from the sale of 164 executive boxes, even though the current stadium has around 80 per cent occupancy on the existing 60 suites. Mr Nally says construction must commence by early 1995 to have the stadium ready for the European Championships in 1996. If Wembley does not agree, he says Stadi Varios will look at a competing site. Mr Nally is involved in a stadium project in Derby, but similar projects in Sunderland and Glasgow have collapsed.</p>

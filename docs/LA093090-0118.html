Among the classes he taught were "Community Dynamics and Ethnicity"  and "Impact of Public Policy on Human Behavior." He also wrote the book, "Boys  No More: A Collection of Writings and Essays on the Psychology of Blacks."  </P> <P> Thomas' wife, Shirley Thomas, was a professor of Afro-American studies at San  Diego State University until her death last year.  </P></p>

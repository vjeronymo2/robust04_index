			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Nuclear Electric to seek aid for Sizewell C Nuclear Electric, the state-owned electricity company which wants to be privatised, is to tell the government that it is unlikely to be able to build Sizewell C, a twin-reactor power station in Suffolk, without 'material support' from the state. Its acknowledgement that it needs government assistance for the Pounds 3.5bn project, for which the company is seeking planning permission, will be seen by environmentalists and rival generators as a significant retreat. Nuclear Electric, which operates the nuclear power stations in England and Wales, has frequently said that Sizewell C can produce electricity at competitive prices and that the company requires no government subsidies after 1998 when the 'nuclear levy' on household power bills ends. The company's policy of asking for 'material support' is being formulated for the government's review of nuclear power which started 10 days ago. The review, likely to take at least until the end of the year, will investigate whether to end the government's temporary ban on new nuclear power stations. It will also consider whether Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear, the other nuclear generator, should be privatised or be allowed to seek private investment for projects. According to an internal Nuclear Electric document, the priority in the review should be privatisation and the commercial freedom it would allow rather than the construction of Sizewell C. The document says, however, that there are 'strong strategic and environmental' reasons for retaining the nuclear option and Sizewell C would be the cheapest way of doing so. 'Material support will be needed from government to give private-sector investors confidence that they will receive the rates of return which they expect. The government will therefore need to decide whether to support Sizewell C' Nuclear Electric said the document represented company policy but denied it was a climbdown. It had always said its claims of competitive prices from Sizewell C assumed government rates of return of 8 per cent rather than the higher rates required by the private sector. The company had also revised downwards its predictions for electricity market prices. That reflected changes in expectations for gas prices and the recent cap on prices in the electricity pool agreed between the industry regulator and National Power and PowerGen, the two main generators using fossil fuels. Nuclear Electric said material support would not necessarily mean direct subsidies. The government could, for example, underwrite liabilities or agree that a certain proportion of electricity be generated from nuclear power. Rival power companies and environmentalists will argue that even those would be a form of subsidy. Mr Clive Bates of Greenpeace, the environmental lobbying group, said yesterday: 'There is going to be another round of special pleading for nuclear power. But there is no case for a special case.' Nuclear Electric's critics will also argue that its revised stance confirms their belief that the company would struggle to survive as a stand-alone private company in a fully competitive market. Nuclear Electric said yesterday it was confident that it could manage its existing power stations profitably in the private sector without subsidy or a levy after 1998.</p>

			<p>920929 FT  29 SEP 92 / Special Report on Franchising (2): It's hard work all the way - The opportunities and the pitfalls WHY SHOULD an established business want to hand over responsibility for developing new outlets to people who are not employees and who may have a strong streak of independence? And why should an individual keen to set up in business on his own account accept the constraints of working to a formula devised by someone else? Franchising works because it represents a compromise which provides enough benefits to both sides to outweigh the limitations it imposes. The franchisor does not have the same control as he would have with employed managers but franchised outlets are often more profitable because the franchisee is more strongly motivated. The franchisee, in turn, may want to set up on his own but not be willing to run all the risks of complete independence. An important advantage to the franchisor is that he can expand more rapidly, using the capital and business skills of his franchisees, than he would have been able to on his own. For a company concerned that rivals may steal a new business idea, franchising allows it to exploit its markets more rapidly. One London company which offered a service cleaning commercial vehicles started to get orders from the Midlands and the North which it could not handle economically. Lacking the funds to set up a large number of branches it grew by taking on franchisees. Franchising also helps solve the problem of motivating branch managers since the franchisee has the carrot of working for himself. It is less clear, though, whether franchising provides an easier means of finding good branch 'managers' than the traditional recruitment route. Recruitment remains a perennial problem for the industry and only one in 100 of the people who approach franchisors actually takes up a franchise. The British Franchise Association (BFA) estimates that the average cost of recruiting a franchisee, including attendance at exhibitions and advertising, is Pounds 2,500. Yet selecting franchisees is crucial to the success of any franchise. Some new franchisors have been tempted to cut corners to get their network up and running or to collect the up-front fees from franchisees. This inevitably leads to higher costs later on if franchisees have to be replaced. One of the biggest worries of a company which takes on franchisees is that they will not maintain the standards it has built up in its company-owned outlets. Wimpy, the fast food chain, was forced to buy back some of its franchised outlets a few years ago because of slipping standards while Tie Rack had to end some franchise agreements because the franchisees had breached the terms of their contracts. Before deciding whether franchising is suitable, a prospective franchisor should run at least one pilot operation for between six months and a year to test whether his business is franchisable. Companies considering franchising should not under-estimate the resources needed, a recent study by the NatWest Centre for Franchise Research stated. Out of 12 franchises studied three had built up networks relatively easily but four had faced teething problems and five had experienced significant difficulties. The franchisors surveyed stressed the importance of having company-owned outlets in which to train franchisees and to monitor and develop their businesses. For the would-be franchisee, the issues to be considered are no less daunting. Firstly he (or she) needs to be sure he has the commitment and the stamina to build up a business. Despite the support provided by the franchisor, the early days will place great demands on the individual. Secondly, the prospective franchisee must be sure that he is not too independently minded for franchising. The industry wants people who are self-reliant enough to run their own business yet willing to accept the need to work within an existing framework. He must then consider what would be the most suitable type of business to go into - a fast-food outlet open all hours and serving the general public or a business with more regular hours and serving the business customer. The range of franchising systems on offer is so broad that most people should be able to find a niche. But can the hopeful franchisee afford the business of his choice? The average cost for setting up a franchise is Pounds 45,900, the BFA calculates, while ongoing annual fees work out at an average of 8.9 per cent of sales. The franchise fee and required outlay on equipment and stock vary from sector to sector. Fees for a quick print franchise are an average of Pounds 15,OOO, twice the industry average, while quick print and catering and hotel equipment charges are also well above the average. Taking up a professional services franchise such as an employment agency, a training consultancy or estate agency is relatively inexpensive because the main asset is the individual's time and expertise. Few individual franchisees can afford to pay for any but the cheapest franchises from their own resources and the banks are usually willing to lend up to two-thirds of the cost of an established, viable franchise. Once the newcomer has chosen a business sector he must look closely at the individual franchises on offer. If it is a new concept, has it been piloted? Does the franchisor have the backing of the main banks and does his prospectus list all the start-up costs? The would-be franchisee should examine the franchisor's accounts and have a lawyer look at the terms of the contract on offer. He should check the franchisor's sales forecasts and carry out his own research into the prospects for that business. How strong is the competition and what is it saying about market prospects? For all the advice that is showered on the new franchisee some still manage to sign up for poorly-managed or unpiloted franchises which fail. Sometimes a franchising format so catches their imagination that they do not carry out the necessary checks. But franchising is not a quick route to riches, nor a guarantee against failure. Franchisees calculate that it takes on average nearly two and a half years to start trading profitably and four years to recover their outlay while 7 per cent of franchised outlets fail in a year. If any business idea was an easy route to riches why would the franchisor want to share it with others?</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Letters to the Editor: Dividend payout problem unclear Sir, Mr Stephen Dorrell is reported to have said (in a speech to the CBI this week) that dividend payouts by British companies may have become too high and too inflexible ('Dorrell critical of high dividends', May 19). According to him, in the early 1980s companies were distributing between 20 and 25 per cent of their after-tax earnings in dividends; but the payout ratio has risen to more than 50 per cent in the early 1990s. There is no virtue in companies retaining profits if they cannot invest the funds profitably. And the Wilson Committee found no evidence that medium or large companies were prevented from investing in profitable projects by any lack of funds. So it is not clear that there is any problem. Mr Dorrell, being a Treasury minister, will be aware that the pound has lost more than 90 per cent of its purchasing power over the past 30 years. How have his calculations allowed for the debasement of the currency? It does have a significant effect on financial statements which use money as the unit of account in measuring 'earnings'.

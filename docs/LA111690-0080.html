			<p><P> November 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DEA SCANDAL BEGAN WITH $16,000 THEFT, JURY  TOLD  </P> <P> A federal prosecutor said in a Los Angeles courtroom Thursday that a Drug  Enforcement Administration corruption scandal began with the theft of $16,000  in drug cash in October, 1982, leading to narcotics trafficking charges being  filed against three agents.  </P> <P> From that point, Asst. U.S. Atty.  </P> <P> Stefan D. Stein said, the agents engaged "in a spree of corruption" that led to  a federal grand jury indictment two years ago charging them, among other  things, with stealing drugs from the DEA's evidence vault in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Two of the agents have pleaded guilty. The trial of the third agent, Darnell  Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, is set to begin Tuesday.  </P> <P> Jury selection was completed Thursday and Stein's co-prosecutor, Asst. U.S.  Atty. Joyce Karlin, said she expects the trial to last about two months. As he  was leaving the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr., Garcia  was asked by a reporter if he was confident of acquittal. "Yeah, a lot," he  said.  </P></p>

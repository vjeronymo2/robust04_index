			<p>BFN     [Text] Brazzaville, 20 Apr (AFP) -- Authorized sources in  Brazzaville today revealed that the Confederation of Congolese  Labor Unions [CSTC], which boycotted negotiations between the  government and the unions in March, finally reached an agreement  with the authorities on 19 April.    The CSTC, one of the country's leading labor unions, signed  the agreement, which has already been endorsed by four other  labor unions, but expressed reservations about certain issues,  especially that of civil servants' salary arrears.    This agreement stipulates: A gradual reimbursement of nine  months' salary arrears to civil servants, which will be  converted into internal debts and; a social truce which will  enable the government to implement the social and economic  redress measures demanded by the International Monetary Fund.    The agreement makes no mention of salary increases for the  public or private sectors, the CSTC's main demand. The CSTC  organized a "warning" strike from 5 to 7 April, demanding a 70  percent salary increase, but the strike was not followed.    The CSTC also decided to join the ad hoc committee set up by  the government and the four labor unions which had earlier  signed the agreement. The committee will examine the  government's economic adjustment measures, notably the  privatization of part of public enterprises.</p>

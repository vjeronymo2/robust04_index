			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: BP tumbles Belief that British Petroleum shares have been carried away with the so-called recovery story triggered a sharp fall in the stock price, which sharply underperformed the sector and the wider market. At the close, BP shares were 7 1/2 down at 303 1/2 p on very healthy turnover of some 11m. The view that the shares had been overbought during the recent upsurge was echoed by Mr John Toalster, oil analyst at Strauss Turnbull and one of the market's biggest bears of BP shares during the past couple of years. 'On a yield basis the shares are massively overvalued; at the very least they are a sell down to 250p and there is every justification to sell them down to 200p,' he said. US investors have been the biggest supporters of BP in recent months, although Mr Toalster said the rate of increase in the US shareholding in BP is slowing down. US investors are thought to speak for some 25 per cent of BP, up from the 23 per cent level at the end of 1992 and the 24 per cent reached in mid-February. Lasmo attracted a fresh wave of heavy selling pressure, which drove the shares down 6 1/2 to 155 1/2 p. Dealers pointed to the substantial level of activity in the stock - turnover was a hefty 5.1m - and said the recent series of institutional visits undertaken by the Lasmo board following the disastrous figures and dividend cut had been badly received. British Gas touched a record 319p early in the session, but later came off to close only 2 up at 316 1/2 p as the market began to take the view that the shares are now fairly valued ahead of the outcome of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry, expected in around a month's time. A report from Halifax Building Services, that house sales in February were higher than at any time during the previous two years, plus the recent sharp slowing in the rate of company insolvencies, prompted another strong performance from bank shares. Abbey National was a big beneficiary of the house sales story, the stock advancing 4 1/2 to 384 1/2 p in heavy turnover of 5.7m shares. Lloyds, still well supported on the market view that the bank is well positioned to increase its dividend at a more rapid rate than its rivals, climbed 9 more to 544p. Nervous selling ahead of the April 8 figures saw Sun Alliance drift off 6 to 343p, although most of the insurance stocks tended to lose ground. Holiday group Airtours fell 6 to 299p as the impact of its failed bid for Owners Abroad was felt. Airtours sold its stake in its rival at a loss of more than Pounds 3m on Tuesday. Owners was steady at 124p. Rothmans International saw its 'B' shares jump 38 to 678p after the tobacco group announced reorganisation details for its Asian tobacco businesses. ICI held up against a forecast downgrade from one of its brokers, Hoare Govett. The house chemicals analyst was unavailable but rival analysts said Hoare cut by around Pounds 100m to Pounds 630m for this year and by Pounds 150m to Pounds 800m for next year. ICI shares were 8 higher with the market at 1177p. The news that international trading group Lonrho had sold its German property interests helped the shares firm 2 to 82p. US buyers were said to have favoured Danka Business and the shares jumped 53 to 645p. UK flag carrier British Airways put on 4 1/2 at 291p after stating that it was bringing forward the payment of its final dividend, to take account of the recent changes in UK advance corporation tax that were announced in last month's Budget. Renewed caution on Eurotunnel's dispute with Channel tunnel constructor TML saw the shares surrender 11 to 462p. Advertising group WPP was firm ahead of tomorrow's call on the Pounds 88m rights issue. The ordinary stock gained a penny at 56p while the nil-paid moved ahead 2 to 11 1/2 p. Textile group William Baird fell 22 to 266p in reaction to the announcement of 1992 profits. The headline figure of Pounds 23.4m was in line with forecasts but there was disappointment that the company did not use the new accounting standards. Women's wear group House of Lerose leapt 40 to 186p after an agreed Pounds 10.8m bid by clothing retailer Country Casuals, which eased 2 to 167p. Shares in construction equipment company BM Group gave up 5 to 31p after the company confirmed a fall in profits and a cut in the dividend as it reported interim figures. Turnover was fairly high, reaching 5.4m by the close.</p>

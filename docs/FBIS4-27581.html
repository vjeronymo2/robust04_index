			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yi Chang-sop] </F>   [Text] Government officials and analysts are casting a  suspicious eye at the role of the United States in Korea's  run-up to entry to the Western well-to-do countries club of the  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  They suspect that Washington might seek to remote-control  Korea's opening its markets and industries wider by taking  advantage of Seoul's planned move to become an OECD member in  1996.    Some government officials said that the United States might  have two game plans in connection with Korea's OECD membership.  One strategy would be to suspend the current bilateral trade  talks and encourage Korea to join the OECD. Once Korea joins  the OECD, the United States will pressure the OECD members to  have Korea further open its markets, they said.    The other plan of the United States might be to intensify  its  pressure on Korea before its entry so that Seoul is forced to  open its markets wider and wider.    A government official who wished to remain anonymous, said,  "Washington has already read the Kim Yong-sam administration's  political will to join the OECD during Kim's tenure." It will  intensify pressure on Seoul to meet the guidelines, practices  and rules that OECD countries maintain, he speculated. But he  said that public sentiment will be in disfavor of Seoul's OECD  membership if the United States is portrayed as playing a  "behind-the-scene role" in opening the Korean market. The  National Assembly will become vocal if lawmakers are persuaded  that Washington is seeking to take advantage of the nation's  OECD membership as an excuse to open Seoul's markets wider, he  said.    The U.S. role will have a critical impact on the nation's  view of the merits and demerits of joining the OECD, he said,  adding that the best strategy for the United States would be "to  take a wait and see attitude to Korea's membership negotiation  with the Paris-based organization." It may be quite dangerous  if the Korean people see the OECD membership as another Uruguay  Round, he added.    Many working-level officials are still having second  thoughts  about whether the nation should be in such a hurry to join the  OECD but in public, they say, "Korea must join the OECD. It is  the commitment of President Kim Yong-sam."    The Ministry of Finance yesterday commissioned lawyers and  economists to act as advisors on issues related to the nation's  preparation to join. The MOF said Korea will initiate  negotiations with the OECD in the latter half of next year for  the nation's application for membership.    Seoul hopes that Korea will be given a full grace period to  meet OECD requirements even after becoming a member. But if the  OECD, egged on by the United States, is rigid in demanding Korea  open its markets wider, there is a risk that Korean may be  forced to delay the membership application at the later stage,  government officials said.    They said, "It is a privilege for the OECD to have such  fast-growing countries as Korea as its members." The OECD  countries have lost their economic and political influence due  to their slow economic growth, high inflation and uncontrollable  trade deficits, they noted.</p>

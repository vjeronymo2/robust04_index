			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Lower costs help Bucknall recovery Bucknall Group, the loss-making quantity surveyor diversifying into a wider spread of construction services, continued its recovery in the half year to October 31 and may reach break-even by the end of the year. The pre-tax loss was Pounds 226,000, compared with Pounds 745,000 last time and Pounds 1.33m for the whole of 1992-93. Losses per share narrowed from 5.7p to 2.2p. The key factors behind the reduced loss were an 18 per cent reduction in the cost base, reduced interest payments and a rising contribution from activities like facilities management. Margins remain under pressure. Turnover increased to Pounds 8.97m (Pounds 8.2m), but was distorted by the passage through the accounts of consultants' fees in Germany. Pointing to greater stability in the UK market and improved prospects internationally, Mr Richard Miles, chairman, noted the widening range of services the group is selling to the construction industry and said prospects for improvement are 'better than they have been for some time'.</p>

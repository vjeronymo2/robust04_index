			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS correspondents Veronika Romanenkova and Semen </F> Ivanov]    [Text] Moscow, 20 May (ITAR-TASS) -- It is planned to hold  a routine meeting of Russian and Kazakhstan experts at the end  of May to discuss questions of concluding a treaty on leasing  the Baykonur complex. But before that, on 20 May, it is  expected that Oleg Soskovets, Russian deputy premier and  cochairman of the interstate commission on Baykonur, will visit  the cosmodrome.    Oleg Soskovets will be present at the launching of a Proton  carrier rocket which is to put into orbit the second Gorizont  space apparatus under a commercial contract with the U.S.  company Rimsat. The deputy premier will also acquaint himself  with the state of affairs at Baykonur.    The agreement between the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan  "On the basic principles and conditions for using the Baykonur  cosmodrome" signed on 28 March by the presidents of the two  countries should be ratified by the relevant state bodies of  Russia and Kazakhstan in the near future. After this, the sides  must conclude the actual treaty on the leasing; specialists on  the interstate commission are already working on drawing up the  treaty.    However, the problems in "space" relations beteen Russia and  Kazakhstan did not end with the signing of the agreement. The  most acutely disputed issue at present is the size of the rent.  The agreement sets the rent at $115 million a year. But the  Kazakh side asserts that this is only the "starting price." In  reality, Russia should pay $480 million a year for Baykonur.  The difference between 115 million and 480 million can be made  up by Russia's allocating to Kazakhstan satellite communications  systems, the results of studies of Kazakhstan's natural  resources, and also by training Kazakhstan's specialists in  space equipment.    The Russian specialists are bewildered at such an "arbitrary  interpretation" of the document. They consider that 115 million  is the total size of the rent which already includes the price  of services provided for Kazakhstan.</p>

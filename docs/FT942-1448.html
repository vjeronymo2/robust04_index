			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Music to the industry's ears Monopoly situations exist in both the music production and retailing industries, but neither operates against the public interest, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said yesterday. The commission, which published its report on the UK music industry yesterday, found that prices of compact discs in the UK were not excessive. It said prices were 'set at levels determined by effective competition in the UK market'. The five leading music companies form a complex monopoly, it said, which means that they engage in practices which prevent, restrict or distort competition. The five - EMI, PolyGram, Sony, Warner and BMG - account for about 70 per cent of the UK market. Among the practices referred to by the commission are restrictions on parallel imports, which allow music companies to block imports of their own products from abroad. The commission said lifting restrictions on parallel imports would be contrary to the European Union rental directive and would increase the risk of music piracy. It said it did not think freer imports of music would result in lower prices. Some countries with no parallel import restrictions had higher CD prices than the UK, it said. The music companies' complex monopoly did not operate against the public interest, the commission said. It added: 'The majors compete vigorously amongst themselves and also with the independent sector, consisting of some 600 companies.' The commission said that, in record retailing, WH Smith and its subsidiary Our Price constitute a scale monopoly, as they supply more than a quarter of the market. However, it added that the WH Smith group, which accounts for 26.6 per cent of UK music sales, operated in a competitive market and did not make excessive music retailing profits. The commission also said there was no case for changing the contracts between artists and record companies. The commission said the proper forum for resolving disputes between artists and companies was in the courts. Pop singer George Michael failed this week in his attempt to get the High Court to declare his contract with Sony unenforceable. Nevertheless, the commission found that contracts have generally moved in artists' favour during the past 20 years. It said advances and royalty rates had increased and the length of contracts had come down.</p>

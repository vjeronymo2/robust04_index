			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [First of two installments of article by Kim Yong-yun, </F> doctor of economics, a research committee member at the Research  Institute for National Unification: "North Korea's Economic  Scale and the Volume of Goods Transferred"]    [Excerpts] Natsuo Sekigawa, a typical Japanese intellectual  and writer of the postwar generation, visited North Korea three  times beginning in 1987, not by invitation, but at his own  expense.    During his trips, he induced his retinue to express their  candid impressions of North Korea and later he wrote a book  about the real situation in North Korea on the basis of these  impressions. The book is titled "Dreary Maze: Real Picture of  North Korea"    In this book Sekigawa describes the Pyongyang-Wonsan  Expressway on which he travelled for the first time as follows:  "The highway to Wonsan can hardly be called an expressway. It  looked something like thick concrete plates randomly laid out.  It seemed that not enough gravel was laid on the road bed. It  was impossible to drive at a high speed because the car rattled  at each seam in the road." However, we are more interested in  the following description.    "As is in Pyongyang, we did not see even a single gas  station all the way to Wonsan. We traveled both ways in the  afternoon on weekdays, but the volume of traffic was very light.  There was not much traffic in Pyongyang, but even less on the  way to Wonsan. I counted the number of cars driving in the  opposite lane, and the number was about 300 for a time period  of slightly over three hours. On the way back the number was  nearly double, but most of the vehicles were spotted near  Pyongyang."    Sekigawa noted that there were very few loaded trucks.  According to him, "On our way back to Pyongyang from Wonsan, we  saw 10 or more trucks loaded with lumber, and there were only a  small number of trucks also. A truck with its cargo compartment  covered passed by on the opposite lane. There was no way of  knowing whether the truck was loaded or not. The rest of the  trucks were either empty or carried passengers. Not a single  long-distance bus was seen."    Sekigawa says the situation was much the same when he  visited North Korea in 1991, four years after his first visit  in 1987. He says that during his last visit he noticed that the  volume of traffic on the Wonsan-Pyongyang expressway (a simple  paved highway for motor vehicles in his words) had rather  decreased.    He could see about 30 vehicles passing in the opposite lane  during a drive of slightly less than three hours over a 200  kilometer distance. About half of them were empty trucks, and  some of the trucks carried passengers.    Sekigawa says he could not spot even a single long-distance  van, and the sights outside viewed from his car were very much  the same as he had seen during his first trip. He saw many  vehicles standing in the countryside--apparently broken down.  Oxen were tilling the fields; only a few tractors were at work  in the paddies; and on the street some tractors were carrying  passengers in trailers. From the scanty movement of freight, he  could tell that very few products made on the east coast were  shipped to the west coast.    South Korean journalists who visited Pyongyang to cover the  International Parliamentary Union [IPU] general meeting in 1991  also reported seeing very few cargo-carrying trucks during the  600-kilometer round trip on the Pyongyang-Wonsan-Kaesong-Mt.  Kumgang route, particularly on the Pyongyang-Wonsan expressway.  Other travelers visiting North Korea have given similar  impressions of the expressways in North Korea.    Each time I come across these travel accounts about North  Korea, I always wonder how the volume of goods transported  could be so little. This skepticism intensifies all the more  when I compare it with the scale of North Korea's national  income.    As of 1991, North Korea's per capita national income,  computed in the same way we compute our GNP, is estimated at  $1,038, and its per worker GNP at $2,271. The $1,038 per capita  income is equivalent to South Korea's 1977 per capita income.    It is problematical to compare the scales of the economies  of the North and South in terms of the size of the national  income or fiscal expenditure. North Korea's 1991 fiscal scale  ($17.2 billion) corresponds to somewhere between the comparable  figures of South Korea's 1980 and 1981 budgets. However, there  is too large a gap between the figures cited above and the  volume of goods transported in North Korea actually observed by  travelers.    North Korea's land transportation system gives more weight  to freight transportation than to passenger transportation. The  North Korean authorities explain that with the gradual increase  in the transportation of raw materials and supplies needed in  economic development, the importance of passenger  transportation has decreased. They also say that given its weak  foreign exchange position, North Korea had no alternative but  to expand and develop railway transportation, powered by coal  and electricity, so that it could conserve oil, the supply of  which depends wholly on imports.    Still, the volume of goods transported in North Korea that  could be inferred on the basis of actual observations by  travelers is way too small compared with the scale of the North  Korean economy as projected by its per capita national income.  This raises doubts as to the validity of the estimated per  capita national income of North Korea. [passage omitted]    Even where most materials are transported by rail as in  North Korea, when railway transportation is inadequate,  naturally road transportation is bound to come into play to  compensate. This is the basic universal economic principle of  seeking efficiency that applies all economic systems alike.    North Korea's expressway system crosses the country coast to  coast connecting Nampo and Wonsan on the one hand, and on the  other runs from north to south linking Huichon and Kaesong,  with Pyongyang as its center. North Korea had its own reason  for connecting these cities by expressways: the purpose was to  connect these industrial areas and ports to Pyongyang. With  Pyongyang as its axis, the expressway system connects Pyongyang  to Nampo Port to the west; Wonsan Port to the east, behind  which lie the Hamhung and Hungnam metallurgical and chemical  industrial areas; and Huichon, the center of the precision  machine and automobile industries, to the north.    The recently completed Kaesong-Pyongyang expressway in the  northern part is playing the role of a passage to Pyongyang  from South Korea. In other words, the North Korean expressways  connect the areas that need to be developed as an essential  requirement and on a priority basis in order to link different  industrial centers.    Entry to modern society means entry to an automobile-based  society. As industry develops, automotive transportation of  goods and personnel becomes all the more important. North  Korea's expressways could prove as efficient as railways as a  means of transportation. But that did not happen, and this may  indirectly prove that there is a big gap between the actual  scale of the North Korean economy and our estimate of it.</p>

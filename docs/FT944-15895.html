			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / As They Say in Europe: Save some headline space for au pairs A headline in the Swiss-German weekly Die Weltwoche the other day read: 'Switzerland is an invention of radicalism.' This view is not held widely, but it turns out that modern Switzerland owes much to its Radical-Democratic party. (So interesting was this story that it was reproduced in French-language papers as well.) In fact, the party has just celebrated the 100th anniversary of its founding. While outsiders fail to recognise this grouping as the power-house of Swiss politics - it has been in government for 50 years, thanks to its rigorous rejection of radicalism and internal democracy - Weltwoche marked the centenary by interviewing Urs Altermatt who is, in fact, a historian rather than a ski resort. The first question conveys the unique nature of Swiss political discourse: 'Does not the Radical-Democratic party pretend, no doubt for reasons of coquetry, to be younger than it really is?' Suddenly, the foreign reader is floundering in an exotic, even incomprehensible, political landscape. How do the lush fronds of political seduction blossom in alpine valleys? This lengthy introduction is necessary so as not to deter those who may fear that this year's trip through the columns of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung will be as dull as they believe Switzerland to be. (A reputation promoted sedulously by the French and, even more so, by the British.) It is believed widely in the country that the NZZ once ran a piece headlined: 'One hundred years of the electric light in Switzerland' as a lead story - although this could not happen because the paper never runs Swiss stories on its front page, except for referendum results. It was, in fact, the top news feature on the paper's domestic pages. Lead stories in the Neue Zurcher are, therefore, unpredictable. Last weekend, most of the front page consisted of a piece entitled: 'Great Britain - European and global.' It opened with the words: 'Without Germany and France, European union is unthinkable,' and ended with: 'European union in a deeper sense is today unthinkable without the critical, intensive participation of the UK in Brussels.' The conclusion was that Britain served even the smaller nations thanks to its outward-looking policies. This compliment, argued with a wealth of detail and backed by a fund of knowledge, is based partly on the observation that the British civil service is 'schooled in a global dimension'. After the re-opening of the Euro-split at the Tory party's annual conference in Bournemouth this week, the NZZ's view gains an added significance. True sceptics, such as Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, can hope to wreck any chance of European unity by promoting a British withdrawal. It is a long time since the cry 'they can't do it without us' has echoed through Whitehall. Turning the page of the Neue Zurcher, you find two columns on the Labour party conference, which had just ended. It was another interesting piece about what might be deemed a sort of British achievement: Tony Blair's campaign to turn Labour into a modern party in a way that its last leader, John Smith, never imagined. It ended with a warning to Blair: 'He has only to protect himself against being mistaken for a Tory.' Working through the paper, you come across a memoir of the day 50 years earlier 'when the second world war came to Basle'. The allies had bombed some sluices on the Rhine and threatened the Swiss town with flooding. There was also an article headlined, intriguingly: 'Are the people to blame for everything?' That was about the crisis of confidence in politics and the system. The domestic news was dominated by a whole page devoted to the problems faced by au pair girls in Switzerland. One had never assumed there were such beings, for they must represent a coals-to-Newcastle situation. It turns out there are thousands from Scandinavia and France who go to the country to learn German. Still, the existence of widespread homesickness among the au pair sorority has led to the formation of a club that sounds irresistibly attractive - the Swiss Association of Girlfriends of Young Girls. This might provide the answer to Groucho Marx's prayer, for such a club would have to reject anyone who really wanted to join. Apart from au pairs. Switzerland might not actually be a product of radicalism but it is different. A couple of weeks ago, I listened to a conversation between a colleague who had once worked in Berne and a leading Swiss journalist. Both insisted, to my incredulity, that Switzerland can be a marvellously interesting country full of interesting people. I begin to see what they mean.

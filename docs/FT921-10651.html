			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Nissan profit 'under pressure' PROFITS for the year to March at Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest car producer, are under pressure from high wages and falling demand, according to Mr Yutaka Kume, president, Reuter reports from Tokyo. 'We had enjoyed robust domestic demand, and along with that, wages increased. We made huge investments that put a depreciation burden on the company, and recently domestic demand has suffered a decline,' he said. 'In this environment, our profits have been squeezed a lot,' Mr Kume added. Nissan's net profit in the year ended March 31 1991 was Y164.75bn (Dollars 1.31bn).</p>

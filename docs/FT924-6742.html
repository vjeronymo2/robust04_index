			<p>921119 FT  19 NOV 92 / International Company News: TWA wrangle takes fresh twist THE long-running wrangle between interested parties at Trans World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, took a new twist yesterday, as the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which underpins pension benefits in the US, rejected a proposal from the airline's creditors. Part of the proposal would have involved Mr Icahn providing a Dollars 200m short-term loan to TWA. This would have helped tide the carrier through the difficult winter period, until it emerged from bankruptcy. But the PBGC said the proposal would not have given adequate protection to pension plans at the airline, which it claims are underfunded by Dollars 1.2bn, and would have allowed Mr Icahn to escape the complex pension situation 'at a small fraction of his obligations'. The PBGC struck a deal with the airline, its unsecured creditors and unions last month. Under this deal, TWA would issue 15-year notes, totalling Dollars 300m, to cover a portion of the underfunding. The two pension plans would be closed off shortly before the airline emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, so that the agency could then pursue its claims against Mr Icahn and his other business interests. The PBGC said yesterday that it was prepared to accept amendments to that agreement, but that the latest creditors' proposal failed 'to meet the test', when it came to protection of pension interests. Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways' chief executive, yesterday reiterated his unwillingness to go ahead with a Dollars 750m investment in USAir, the US carrier, if the US aviation authorities insist that the opening-up of Heathrow Airport is a condition for approving the deal. However, he suggested there could be 'in-between positions, and certainly there is no reason why our respective governments cannot agree on the achievement of those objectives'. This brought a retort from United Airlines, one of the big three US carriers opposing the BA/USAir deal in the absence of a aviation pact between the UK and the US. Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, described BA's 'protectionist posture' as 'not in the interests of consumer, US flag carrier, their employees and the communities they serve'.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / Christopher hopes China heeds demands for improved human rights Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday voiced his hope that China would meet Washington's demands for improved human rights, while appearing to move away from the Clinton administration's linkage of trade and human rights in dealings with Beijing, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington. Mr Christopher said on national television that China relied on the US market for about 40 per cent of its exports. This gave Washington substantial leverage. But he also held out prospects that the US might move to separate, or 'de-couple', its human rights and trade policies, particularly China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status. 'For this year we are committed to using MFN,' he said, adding: 'There are many other tools we can use down the road if we get past this year.' Mr Christopher said he was not talking of 'the linking' so much as 'broadening the relationship'.</p>

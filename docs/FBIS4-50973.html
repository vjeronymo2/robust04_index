			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Excerpt] The Chinese government has withheld announcing  urban inflation figures for April. Officials apparently hope to  distract attention from soaring city prices, which could  exacerbate unease in the weeks leading up to the fifth  anniversary of the crushing of the Tiananmen Square protests.    The cost of living in 35 cities rose by 23.3 per cent in  April, down from 24.5 per cent in March, according to sources at  the State Statistical Bureau (SSB) in Beijing. But, in  announcing inflation figures last week, officials released only  the national urban-rural average. Regarding the cities, the  bureau said only that the rate of big city inflation had slowed.  The unpublished April urban figure was the second consecutive  monthly drop from the peak of 25.9 per cent in February, but the  moderate rate of decline was a blow to the State Council's much  ballyhooed price inspection campaign carried out in March and  April, which officials had hoped would bring the urban figure  below 20 per cent.    "These big cities are a special situation. They are not  representative of the overall success of the campaign," an SSB  official said.    The overall picture showed national consumer price inflation  slowing to 21.7 per cent in April, from 22.5 per cent in March.  Beijing has set a national inflation target of 10 per cent for  the year, which many officials have already publicly discounted  as unrealistic. SSB sources said administrative measures had  been largely ineffective in controlling prices, both in big  cities and in small towns.    The State Council team sent to Guangdong reported in  mid-April that "price hiking momentum is relatively grim" after  inspecting Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan and Dongguan.    Hubei's vice-governor, Chen Shuiwen, reported at the end of  April that "the progress of the general price inspection has  been uneven".    "Price increases in some localities have not been  effectively  controlled. The prices of a few commodities have even bounced  back up again," Chen said. [passage omitted]</p>

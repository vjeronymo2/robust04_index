			<p><P> February 25, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> BOYS' SOCCER PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> MISSION VIEJO PICKS OFF CERRITOS EARLY, OFTEN  </P> <P> The Mission Viejo High School boys' soccer team defeated Cerritos, 7-1, in a  Southern Section 3-A quarterfinal match Friday at Mission Viejo, but coaches of  both teams said it was over by the time the score was 2-0 early in the second  half.  </P> <P> "When the second goal hit them, they knew they were in trouble," Mission Viejo  Coach Cal Foster said.  </P> <P> Cerritos Coach Ron Flores agreed: "Oh yeah, it fell apart after the second and  third goals. I just started looking at my watch, hoping the time would pass."  </P> <P> The Diablos (24-3), who will play St. Francis in Tuesday's semifinals, led,  1-0, at halftime on senior forward Jim Eddow's breakaway goal with 4 minutes  remaining in the half. Eddow was rewarded by being taken out of the game in the  second half.  </P> <P> "We put in two faster forwards at the half (Jeff Jurgemeyer and Mark Gaw)  because we knew we could get outside because we were faster," Foster said.  </P> <P> The move to speed paid quick dividends for Mission Viejo as Gaw scored from  point-blank range just 4 minutes into the second half after he gained control  of Andy Wortrich's blocked shot.  </P> <P> Two minutes later, center Joe-Max Moore scored the first of his two goals on a  35-footer to put Mission Viejo ahead, 3-0. Moore also scored 31 minutes into  the second half when he split two defenders to the right of the goal and  left-footed a cross shot from 15 feet out.  </P> <P> Wortrich, Todd Patrick and Steve Vanderweide also scored for Mission Viejo.  Eddie Soto scored Cerritos' goal.  </P></p>

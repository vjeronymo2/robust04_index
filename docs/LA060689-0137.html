			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES;  </P> <P> SCOTT STRAINS HAMSTRING IN PRACTICE, IS QUESTIONABLE FOR GAME 1 TONIGHT  </P> <P> Laker guard Byron Scott strained his left hamstring in practice Monday and is  questionable for Game 1 of the National Basketball Assn. championship series  tonight against the Detroit Pistons.  </P> <P> Scott, the Lakers' third-leading playoff scorer, is expected to be examined  today by team doctors Robert Kerlan and Stephen Lombardo. He left practice  early and returned to the team's hotel, where he received periodic ice  treatments throughout the day, according to Laker spokesman Josh Rosenfeld.  </P> <P> Laker practices are closed, but Scott was seen limping out of the Palace with  an ice bag strapped to his left leg. Neither Scott nor Laker trainer Gary Vitti  could be reached Monday. Rosenfeld said that Scott suffered the injury while  "landing wrong" after a rebound.  </P> <P> If Scott is unable to play, the Lakers probably would start Michael Cooper in  Scott's off-guard spot.

			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Phibro Energy to cut jobs by 30% in restructuring SALOMON yesterday announced a restructuring of its Phibro Energy subsidiary that will involve separating the unit's commodities trading and oil refining businesses and laying off about 30 per cent of its employees worldwide, writes Patrick Harverson. To cover the costs of the changes at Phibro, Salomon will be taking a pre-tax charge of between Dollars 25m and Dollars 35m in the fourth quarter. In addition, Salomon will be reporting another charge of between Dollars 60m and Dollars 70m to cover the cost of moving most of its 3,000 New York-based staff into one Manhattan location. As part of Phibro's restructuring, its oil refining and other asset business, as well as its partnership in the White Nights Russian oil production venture, will be run separately from the rest of Phibro by its current management, under the guidance of the Salomon parent group. Salomon said it would eventually consider selling these operations, or entering into a joint venture, or any other manoeuvre that would 'maximise value for share-holders'. The remainder of Phibro will be run as a commodities trading firm.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Acting Economy Minister Andres Couve said the  problem posed by Chilean fishmeal exports to Mexico are a  national problem.    Couve ratified the government's support for Chilean fishmeal  producers by explaining that commercial sanctions imposed by  Mexico, although the conflict only involves private companies,  will affect the entire Chilean fishmeal industry.    According to Couve, the Mexican Fishmeal Industry Chamber  has  charged four Chilean companies -- Coloso, Eperba, Iquique, and  Indo -- of dumping, that is, of selling fishmeal in Mexico at  prices below those they would sell in Chile.    However, the compensatory fees these enterprises will have  to  pay will be extended to all other Chilean fishing companies.  This information was confirmed by Chilean Ambassador to Mexico  Julio de la Fuente. [recorded passage indistinct]    We are going to grant our full support to the Chilean  fishing  companies because our objective is that the Mexican sanctions be  lifted, stated Andres Couve, who said the compensatory fees  established by Mexico almost ban Chilean fishmeal from entering  the Mexican market.    He recalled that fishmeal exports are the ones that have  increased most among Chilean exports to Mexico.    He added that this situation benefits Peru, which has grown  and is now competing with very low prices in markets that were  supplied exclusively by Chile until recently.</p>

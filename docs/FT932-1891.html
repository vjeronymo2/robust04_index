			<p>930622 FT  22 JUN 93 / Tories fear future without Heseltine: Alison Smith on how the party might cope should it lose its most prominent 'left-winger' THE DISMAY of shocked Tory MPs goes beyond the fact that for some weeks at least one of the cabinet's most formidable operators would not necessarily be there to handle the latest piece of political bad news. What, asked some of them, if the trade and industry secretary decided to resign? If Mr Heseltine were to leave the government, his departure would leave Mr John Major with difficulties well beyond even those of losing a senior colleague and key adviser. But a decision by Mr Heseltine to leave the government would still be deeply demoralising for his party. Any further cabinet re-shuffle would inevitably create tensions so soon after the one which was supposed to last until next summer, perhaps particularly given the lingering dissatisfaction with the limited scale of the last set of moves. It would create a feeling of instability, heightened by the expectation that at some point before the next election Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, is likely to want to leave the cabinet. At a time when Tory party faction fighting continually breaks out into the open, the prime minister's task in re-balancing his cabinet would be particularly sensitive. The right might well see the opportunity to break the 'stranglehold' by the left of the party on the three economic departments of the Treasury under Mr Kenneth Clarke, and Mr David Hunt at the Department of Employment, as well as Mr Heseltine at the Department of Trade and Industry. Although there are signs of economic recovery - and Mr Clarke's move to the Treasury has put the government in a better position to make the most of them - many Tory MPs still feel battered by recent events. There are few senior ministers who can cheer them by launching such effective attacks on the opposition that even divisions among Conservative backbenchers fade into the background temporarily. The government would also be left woefully short of heavyweights and those with long political experience. Mr Heseltine's reputation was tarnished by the the fiasco of the pits closure programme, which last October that prompted the most significant non-Maastricht Tory rebellion since the election, and resulted in a damaging climbdown by the government. But even so, his sheer political longevity has makes him a figure who could not be replaced at a moment's notice.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Telemetro Reports" newscast] </F>   [Text] Panama will seek a consensus for getting the U.S.  Congress to approve the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty [MLAT].    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Now that the  elections are near, do you think this will delay the U.S.  Congress in approving MLAT? We have not yet received any answer  to that effect.    [Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino] I am leaving for  Washington on Wednesday for bilateral conversations with U.S.  State Department officials and some congressmen. I have  requested an appointment with Senator Helms, the undersecretary  of state for Latin American Affairs, and the secretary of the  Panama Canal Commission Board of Directors to officially talk  about topics of mutual interest. This treaty is obviously one of  these topics. I do not see why our electoral process should  interfere with the Senate approving the treaty, which should be  an urgent issue because of the importance of the document to the  bilateral mechanism that it establishes between our two  governments and both nations' goals for the fight against drugs.    [Reporter] Apparently the U.S. Government is not aware of  that urgency because there has not been any reply so far.    [Mulino] I would not say that about the U.S. Government. The  government as such, the executive branch, did what it had to do:  negotiate and sign the treaty.    [Reporter] Is it the Senate then?    [Mulino] It is in the hands of the Senate, and it is up to  the legislative branch to do its work. That is precisely the  purpose of my visit. I am going to talk with them; explain that  we are interested in it becoming a mechanism that will very  shortly become law. We will exchange the documents whereby both  senates [as heard] ratify it, and then we will proceed to  implement it. I think it is a very effective and good measure  for collaborating in the fight against drugs and similar crimes.  [end recording]</p>

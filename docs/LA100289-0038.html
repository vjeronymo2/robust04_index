			<p><P> October 2, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR OKS INSURANCE AID TO CATASTROPHIC ILLNESS VICTIMS  </P> <P> People who suffer from AIDS, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and other serious  illnesses will be able to purchase health insurance for the first time through  a state-subsidized program under legislation signed Sunday by Gov. George  Deukmejian.  </P> <P> After years of vetoing similar bills, the governor approved a compromise  catastrophic health insurance program that will rely on tobacco tax revenues to  aid as many as 300,000 uninsured Californians who suffer from such long-term  illnesses.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's approval of the health care bill came as he took action on dozens  of bills, including signing a measure that will impose a tough new drunk  driving standard on truck drivers and commercial boat operators by reducing the  legal blood alcohol level from .10% to .04%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> DMV Release of Addresses  </P> <P> And in the hope of preventing another murder like that of actress Rebecca  Schaeffer in July, the governor signed a bill restricting the release of home  addresses by the Department of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> He also signed legislation to help finance construction of an Olympic athlete  training center in southern San Diego County. It will be financed by a loan  from the state and repaid through the sale of commemorative Olympic license  plates for $100 per pair.  </P> <P> But once again, the governor vetoed legislation that would have required all  students in grades 7-12 to receive AIDS prevention instruction unless their  parents specifically object to it.  </P> <P> "Our schools are aware of the importance of this instruction and are responding  appropriately to the challenge without the additional programs and mandated  costs that this bill would create," the governor said in his veto message.  </P> <P> The Republican governor's decision to sign the catastrophic health insurance  bill came after years of wrangling over who should pay the cost of caring for  devastating illnesses such as AIDS and cancer that can bankrupt patients who do  not have health insurance.  </P> <P> This year, Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento) was able to negotiate a  compromise by proposing that the state pay for the program with an estimated  $30 million in interest on revenues from Proposition 99, the tobacco tax  increase approved by voters last year.  </P> <P> At the same time, the bill provides for fewer benefits than those contained in  measures vetoed by the governor in previous years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Rejected Advice  </P> <P> In signing the Isenberg bill, Deukmejian rejected the urgings of some of his  own health and finance advisers, who had opposed the measure.  </P> <P> There are an estimated 244,000 to 300,000 Californians who are unable to  purchase health insurance because they have such conditions as cancer, heart  disease, AIDS, diabetes, lupus or epilepsy.  </P> <P> But the number of them able to purchase the state-subsidized insurance could be  limited by the high premiums, estimated to range from $1,300 to $3,500 a year  when the program gets under way in 1991.  </P> <P> Deukmejian's approval of stricter standards for drinking by truck drivers comes  just two weeks after he signed a measure reducing the drunk driving standard  for all motor vehicle operators from .10% to .08%.  </P> <P> The latest measure by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) would impose the .04%  standard on all commercial vehicle drivers, including boat and ship operators.  </P> <P> The law, which will take effect Jan. 1, 1992, will bring California in line  with federal standards and prevent the state from losing as much as $86 million  a year in highway funds after 1995.  </P> <P> Seymour said a stricter drunk driving standard should apply to truck drivers  and commercial boat operators because of the potential danger they pose to the  public.  </P> <P> "There is a great difference between the skill it takes to drive an automobile  and carrying 40 tons of steel in a tractor-trailer," he said.  </P> <P> The legislation restricting access to motor vehicle records was prompted by the  discovery that Robert John Bardo, the suspected killer of actress Rebecca  Schaeffer, obtained her home address from the Department of Motor Vehicles.  </P> <P> Under the bill by Assemblyman Mike Roos (D-Los Angeles), people who wish to  keep their home address confidential may do so by submitting an alternative  address, such as a post office box or place of work, which could be released.  </P> <P> The bill had the emotional backing of Schaeffer's parents and actors and  actresses who have been stalked by unwelcome fans.  </P> <P> Deukmejian earlier issued an executive order requiring the Department of Motor  Vehicles to delay the release of personal information for 10 days while  officials notify the person whose records are being sought.  </P> <P> The governor's office also announced that Deukmejian:  </P> <P> * Signed a bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sepulveda) allowing local law  enforcement agencies to seize liquor licenses from restaurants, bars and liquor  stores where illegal activity occurs. * Signed two bills by Assemblyman Bruce  Bronzan (D-Fresno) designed to improve the testing of pesticide residues in  food. Supported by segments of the agriculture industry, the legislation will  require monitoring of processed foods, require farmers to report their use of  pesticides to the state and spend $1 million to explore alternatives to  pesticide use.  </P> <P> * Vetoed a bill by Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) that would have  required all private and public employers with 25 or more workers to provide  AIDS education classes. Deukmejian said he believes businesses should be  responsible for AIDS education for workers only when contracting the disease is  an "occupational hazard."  </P> <P> * Vetoed a bill by Assemblyman Terry Friedman (D-Los Angeles) that would have  required employers to permit workers to use their sick leave to take care of  ill children. The governor said employers can allow such leave without  government interference.  </P> <P> * Signed a measure by Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim) doubling the minimum fine  from $100 to $200 for drivers of large trucks caught speeding the first time.  </P> <P> * Vetoed a bill by Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) that would have made it  illegal for employers to require employees to speak only English while on the  job -- unless such a rule can be justified by business necessity. The governor  said this action already is prohibited under existing state fair employment  regulations.  </P></p>

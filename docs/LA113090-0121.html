			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> WING-A-THON WILL RAISE FUNDS FOR BOY  </P> <P> A 6-year-old boy with an incurable kidney disease will benefit from a  fund-raiser scheduled for 10:30 a.m. Saturday at the Community Center.  </P> <P> The Wing-a-Thon, a chicken wing-eating contest, is for Christopher Carter, son  of Police Officer Jeff Carter.  </P> <P> Christopher is undergoing dialysis and taking medication at a cost to his  family of more than $800 a month. He will eventually need a transplant.  </P> <P> Among those participating will be Councilmen Scott Diehl and Joe Anderson.  Money is being pledged for each wing eaten. The chicken is being donated by the  city's Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.  </P> <P> Jeff Carter joined the Police Department in July after 10 years in the Navy. He  left the service because he was afraid he would be shipped overseas and away  from his son.  </P> <P> But because Christopher's illness was diagnosed before his father joined the  force, the boy is not covered by the Police Department's medical insurance.  </P> <P> To pledge money call (714) 361-8201.  </P></p>

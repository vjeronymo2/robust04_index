			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 25 (CNA) -- Taipei on Wednesday [25  May] suggested that talks with Beijing regarding compensation  for relatives of the Taiwan victims killed in the Qiandao Lake  disaster be held early next month.    Twenty-four Taiwanese tourists and eight mainland guides and  crew were robbed and burned to death in the lower-deck cabin of  a pleasure boat on which they were touring Lake Qiandao in  Zhejiang Province on March 31.    Beijing initially claimed the deaths were accidental, but  then said robbery and arson were to blame after a blistering  attack by Taipei questioning the account of the incident. It  finally arrested four men for their involvement in the crime  after Taipei implemented a tour-group boycott of the mainland,  among other measures.    In a letter to the Association for Relations Across the  Taiwan Strait [ARATS] requesting June talks, the Straits  Exchange Foundation [SEF], the intermediary body set up to  handle cross-strait exchanges, said the incident had inflicted  unprecedented damages on the relationship that had been  burgeoning since civilian exchanges between the two countries  began in 1987.    SEF insisted in the letter that mainland authorities still  need to make public a thorough report on the case as soon as  possible, even though Beijing has said the case is closed.    The mainland, it added, should properly compensate the  victim's relatives, who it said have suffered immensely as a  result of the tragedy.    A SEF delegation, accompanied by lawyers, criminal  investigators and relatives of the victims, visited the lake and  met mainland law enforcement officials earlier this month, and  voiced its doubts about the results of the investigation by  mainland authorities.    In the past two months, ARATS has ignored seven requests by  SEF to hold talks on the incident, saying it would need more  time to prepare for negotiations.</p>

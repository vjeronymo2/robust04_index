			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> CONTRACT DISPUTE DELAYS 747-400 SERVICE;  </P> <P> UNITED PILOTS BALK AT FLYING JUMBO JETS  </P> <P> United Airlines pilots are refusing to fly Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets due for  delivery next month in a contract dispute that has forced the airline to delay  the start-up of service for the new planes.  </P> <P> "We believe that in light of (the pilots' union's) position, . . . immediate  operation of the aircraft will complicate our contract negotiations," Hart  Langer, United senior vice president of flight operations, wrote in a letter to  pilots dated June 20.  </P> <P> "Therefore," he wrote, "for the time being, the start-up of 747-400 service  will be delayed."  </P> <P> Boeing is due to deliver United's first 747-400 by July 5, a second one in  August and two more before the end of the year.  </P> <P> Hank Krakowski, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots Assn., said United pilots  will not fly the jets until a new contract is negotiated covering wages and  working conditions for 747-400 cockpit crews.  </P> <P> "The pilots have been working almost 1 1/2 years without a contract, and we'd  like to see a new agreement," he said.  </P> <P> The new jets are expected to be used to expand United's Pacific routes.  </P></p>

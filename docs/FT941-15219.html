			<p>940117 FT  17 JAN 94 / Venables deals face further scrutiny Further details have emerged of controversial business dealings by Mr Terry Venables, the former chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, as the Football Association struggles to decide whether to make him England manager. Panorama, the BBC current affairs programme, has obtained a document which sheds more light on the way Mr Venables raised money to take over the football club in 1991 with Mr Alan Sugar, the businessman. Doubts over the source of that finance have been a main reason for the FA's unease. A decision on the England manager's post may not now be made this week, as expected. The document supports an allegation Panorama made in September that Mr Venables signed away assets of Transatlantic Inns when he was no longer one of the company's directors. Speaking publicly about the deal for the first time, Mr Colin Wright, a director of Transatlantic, said yesterday: 'We were horrified when we discovered that all of the assets of Transatlantic had been used by Terry Venables to raise a Pounds 1m loan. None of the directors of the company had authorised such a transaction. The implications were terrible for us.' The assets were pledged to a leasing company in August 1991 and leased back. The Pounds 1m raised went to Mr Venables' private company, and shortly afterwards he used the cash to pay for his stake in Tottenham Hotspur. The document sets out part of the 'sale and leaseback' contract with Landhurst Leasing, a company now in receivership. Venables: the questions, Page 13</p>

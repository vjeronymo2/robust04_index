			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD CUP '90;  </P> <P> SCHILLACI LEADS SCORING RACE;  </P> <P> WORLD CUP: WEST GERMANY'S MATTHAEUS WOULD HAVE TO SCORE THREE GOALS AGAINST  ARGENTINA TODAY TO CATCH SICILIAN.  </P> <P> If West Germany's Lothar Matthaeus wants to finish as the World Cup's top  goal-scorer, he will have to produce a hat trick today against Argentina in the  championship match.  </P> <P> Matthaeus comes into the 11 a.m. PDT match at Rome's Olympic Stadium with four  goals, two fewer than Italy's Salvatore Schillaci. The odds are against  Matthaeus succeeding. Only one other player in history -- England's Geoff Hurst  in 1966 -- has scored three goals in a World Cup final.  </P> <P> It was in Bari Saturday night that Schillaci might have made the scoring crown  his own. The Sicilian striker's 84th-minute penalty kick not only gave Italy a  2-1 victory over England and third place in the tournament, it also doubled the  distance between him and Matthaeus.  </P> <P> England's Gary Lineker, the 1986 World Cup scoring leader, came into the match  with four goals but was held scoreless. England's only goal came on a header  from David Platt in the 80th minute after Roberto Baggio had given Italy the  lead 10 minutes earlier.  </P> <P> The match also marked the end of two international careers. England's coach,  Bobby Robson, bowed out after eight years in charge of the national team, and  goalkeeper Peter Shilton announced his retirement after two decades as  England's No. 1 choice in the nets.  </P> <P> In all, Shilton played 125 matches for England, a world record for  international appearances.  </P> <P> "I knew about this about three weeks ago when he came to see me in Cagliari,"  Robson said. "I thought it was a right and proper decision for him. He's going  out at the pinnacle of his career, at the end of a fabulous World Cup for  England and certainly for him.  </P> <P> "He's proved again at the highest level that he's one of the greatest  goalkeepers we've ever seen. For me, I have not seen a better goalkeeper in  this tournament than Peter Shilton.  </P> <P> "He's been one of the great nucleuses of the team during my reign. He's been a  terrific inspiration to everybody, and I have nothing but respect and  admiration for him. It's nice for me that he felt he should go at the same  time."  </P> <P> Robson will take over as coach of the Dutch club, PSV Eindhoven, this fall at a  reported $350,000 a year.  </P> <P> Regarding his retirement, he said: "I'm very sorry. I'm very sad. I shall miss  it a great deal. It's been my life for eight years."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 30, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IN BRIEF: SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SUPERCONDUCTIVITY ADVANCE  </P> <P> Superconducting materials can carry current by two mechanisms, rather than one  as some theories hold, says a study published last week. The findings should  help scientists figure out how superconductivity works, researchers said.  </P> <P> But they still do not know just how superconductivity arises in so-called  "high-temperature" superconductors, which require less chilling than previous  materials before they lose their electrical resistance.  </P> <P> University of Tokyo researchers reported in last week's issue of the British  journal Nature that they developed a new family of compounds in which the  current is carried by electrons, which are tiny charged particles.  </P> <P> In previously known high-temperature superconductors, the charge was carried  instead by roving areas called "holes" that lack electrons, they said.  </P></p>

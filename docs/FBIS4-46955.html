			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Sultan Sartayev, member of the Committee on </F> Interparliamentary Communications of the Supreme Council and  corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences of the  Republic of Kazakhstan, by KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA writer Igor  Cherepanov; place and date not given: "Only a Renewed Government  Can Continue the Economic Reforms. Parliament Has Presented a  Bill to the Executive Power"]    [Text] The deputies supported by a majority of votes  the statement of the Kazakhstan parliament of no confidence in  the socioeconomic course of the Cabinet of Ministers of the  Republic of Kazakhstan. In connection with this event our  correspondent met with a member of the Committee on  Interparliamentary Communications of the Supreme Council, a  corresponding member of the National Academy of Sciences of the  Republic of Kazakhstan Sultan Sartayev and asked him several  questions.    [Cherepanov] Sultan Sartayevich, what do the members of  parliament see as the groundlessness of the government policy?    [Sartayev] It seems to me that we have strayed a long way  from the discussions to the effect that "it is necessary to  conduct reforms." As today's reality shows, there have been no  deeply considered economic transformations. This is stated  unequivocally both by our economists and by our esteemed  colleagues from nearby foreign countries. Therefore the majority  of the deputy corps have decided that the government has  exhausted its reform possibilities, and that was the point of  departure for the essentially unprecedented statement.    [Cherepanov] In your opinion, what was the principal mistake  or, if you will, omission of the creators of our economic policy?    [Sartayev] First of all that we are unable to intelligently  dispose of foreign credits and check to make sure whether they  are used as intended for target programs or thoughtlessly  wasted. After all, according to press reports a considerable  amount is being awarded to the republic.    Second, the bank credit system in its present form is  clearly  working against the commodity producer. Everyone knows that  production cannot develop without a long-term financial policy.  This policy is destructive to the state. The reforms will not  move a step forward without support from small- and medium-sized  business.    But as far as I know, they are the ones being bypassed in  the  distribution of credit, which gets to those that have already  blazed a trail to the market and have become strong enough.  Apparently we must fully revise the legislative acts, releasing  the entrepreneur from the economic fetters. This is apparently a  task for a renewed government. I have not misspoken here. I  think that the president--and here the deputies agree with  me--must distance himself from the present Cabinet of Ministers.    [Cherepanov] The appearance of the statement coincided in  time with the creation of the "shadow" government headed by  Supreme Council Deputy Vitaliy Roze. What do you think about  that?    [Sartayev] The appearance of the "shadow" will to a certain  degree serve as a catalyst for a more rational, weighed policy  on the part of our present government. But I must say that with  the presidential form of rule its appearance in and of itself is  nonsense.    [Cherepanov] This is probably not the last act of  disagreement of the deputies regarding serious questions of  state policy.    [Sartayev] Many analysts predicted that the new Supreme  Council would be "tame." Fortunately, the predictions were  wrong. If the parliament were to unanimously approve everything  proposed by the executive power without discussing it or delving  into its essence, no progress would be forthcoming. This  statement shows that the deputies have seriously undertaken to  improve the economic, social, and legal policy. Let me emphasize  once again that the Supreme Council must revise the entire tax  and credit system and banking legislation in order to avoid a  repetition of the situation in which the reforms run up against  a blind wall.</p>

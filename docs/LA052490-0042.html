			<p><P> May 24, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAMARENA CASE WITNESS TESTIFIES ABOUT SEEING REMAINS OF HUSBAND  </P> <P> The widow of an American writer killed by drug traffickers in Mexico in 1985  tearfully described examining her dead husband's body at the Guadalajara morgue  in wrenching testimony Wednesday at the trial of four men charged in the murder  of DEA Agent Enrique Camarena.  </P> <P> Mary Evelyn Walker, now a Texas schoolteacher, described in Los Angeles federal  court how she was told that the remains of her husband, John Walker, were at  the morgue in June, 1985, after she had spent months trying to find him.  </P> <P> She said the State Department called her St. Paul, Minn., home on Feb. 14,  1985, to tell her that Walker, a free-lance writer, had disappeared from  Guadalajara.  </P> <P> In fact, the writer and his friend, Alberto Radelat, a medical student, were  already dead. They had been beaten to death by narcotics traffickers after they  apparently stumbled into a party of the Guadalajara drug cartel at the city's  La Langosta restaurant on Jan. 30, 1985, and were mistaken for DEA agents.  Their remains were discovered in a local park on June 19, 1985.  </P> <P> Mrs. Walker said she went to the morgue with Radelat's father. She said she  knew one of two bodies lying on tables was that of her husband as soon as she  saw it.  </P> <P> "It was only a skeleton, but not just a skeleton," she testified, trying to  contain her tears. "There were parts of his body still on him -- one of his  eyes, his overlip . . . his mustache. It was John. It was, unmistakably, John."  </P> <P> Only one of the four men on trial in the Camarena case, Javier Vasquez Velasco,  is accused of the Walker and Radelat murders, which occurred only eight days  before the abduction and slaying of the agent in Guadalajara.  </P> <P> Vasquez is being tried with the other three defendants, over the objections of  his defense lawyer, because U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie determined that  there were significant connections between the killings.  </P> <P> At the start of the trial, federal prosecutor John Carlton said Guadalajara  narcotics traffickers committed a series of retaliatory acts against the DEA  because they were angry about major raids in 1984 that had cost the traffickers  $5 billion.  </P> <P> The murders of Walker and Radelat were described as being among those  retaliatory acts.  </P> <P> Another of those acts, according to prosecutors, was an attempt by drug  traffickers to kill a Guadalajara attorney, Cesar Garcia Bueno, after they  learned he was providing information to Camarena.  </P> <P> Testifying Wednesday from a wheelchair, Garcia described how a gunman entered a  Guadalajara restaurant, shot him in the back, and said, "you're dying, because  you are a snitch."  </P> <P> Later in the day, the prosecution ran into some difficulties.  </P> <P> In one potentially significant development, Thomas Gomez, a DEA agent who was  sent to Guadalajara on special assignment in the fall of 1984, said that he had  been in the Mexican city from mid-October to mid-November of that year and had  not seen Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, one of the men he was assigned to check  out.  </P> <P> Matta is one of the four defendants in the case. The government has accused  Matta, a convicted Honduran drug lord, of being one of the plotters of  Camarena's kidnaping and murder and allege that he took part in meetings to  plan the assassination in October, 1984, in Guadalajara.  </P> <P> Outside court, Matta's defense lawyer, Martin R. Stolar, said he thought  Gomez's statement was "very significant" because it raised questions about the  government's charges against Matta.  </P> <P> At mid-afternoon, another key government witness, Enrique Placentia Aguilar, a  former member of the Guadalajara police SWAT team, said he was present at a  December, 1984, meeting during which Camarena's photo was passed around among a  number of drug traffickers -- including Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, Rafael Caro  Quintero and others linked to the Camarena killing.  </P> <P> Placentia said that defendant Vasquez was among those who were at the meeting.  However, he was unable to identify him in court Wednesday.  </P> <P> Later, outside the presence of the jury, Assistant U.S. Atty. Manuel Medrano,  one of the prosecutors, said that Placentia had identified Vasquez recently  when he was shown a photocopy of his photo.  </P> <P> Placentia's forgetfulness was potentially harmful to the prosecution. He  allegedly was an eyewitness to the Walker killing at the restaurant and was to  have testified that Vasquez was present.  </P> <P> The final witness of the day was Hector Cervantes Santos, another former  Mexican law enforcement officer, who served for several years as a bodyguard to  a Mexican attorney, Javier Barba Hernandez, who was closely allied with drug  traffickers. Barba was killed in a 1986 shoot-out with Mexican police, amid  rumors that high government officials were concerned that he might be  questioned about the Camarena killing.  </P> <P> According to the prosecution's case, some of the key meetings to plan  Camarena's abduction and killing were held at Barba's house in late 1984. Late  Wednesday, Cervantes, now a paid U.S. government informant, said he was present  at a September, 1984, baptism for Barba's son.  </P> <P> Cervantes said that defendant Ruben Zuno Arce was also present at the baptism,  along with several major drug traffickers; Javier Garcia Paniagua, now the  Mexico City police chief and formerly the head of Mexico's leading political  party, the PRI, and defendant Vasquez.  </P> <P> The witness identified both Zuno and Vasquez in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Cervantes said that during the baptism party a small meeting was held at  Barba's house in which a drug trafficker and Zuno discussed a DEA agent who was  causing them trouble. Cervantes quoted Zuno as saying that the agent "should be  picked up."  </P> <P> Prosecutors did not ask the witness to name the agent during Wednesday's  testimony.  </P></p>

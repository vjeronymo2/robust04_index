			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Medical insurers curb premium rises HEALTH insurers have begun to lance the boil of medical cost-inflation which has bedevilled the industry. The result is a lower rate of increase in premiums this year - an encouraging sign after a period when a combination of factors seemed to be pushing private health insurance out of the reach of many people. Insurers reassess their premiums twice a year, although customers pay only once. The British United Provident Association (Bupa), the largest medical insurer, announced increases of 14.7 per cent for the year for individual subscribers, but those renewing company schemes will see an increase of only 7.2 per cent. These figures followed increases the previous year of 23 per cent. Norwich Union Healthcare has increased its premiums by 10 per cent for the year, a figure equalled, on average, by Western Provident Association. This figure is higher for the elderly - pensioners on WPA health insurance schemes which qualify for tax relief face an increase of 25 per cent this year, following a 36 per cent rise last year. But these rises are only averages. On some policies, insurers have frozen premiums, or even decreased them. Private Patients Plan has announced that premiums will drop by 5 per cent in July. When combined with the increase announced earlier in the year, that means premiums for around 250,000 policy-holders, will reduce or stay the same. Reductions will fall mostly on budget plans - for example, a family headed by a 50-year-old would see a reduction in monthly premiums from Pounds 41.40 to Pounds 38.20. What lies behind the increases? Lawrence Hager, of Noble Lowndes, identifies several factors which together cause the trend to higher premiums. These include: Medical inflation - which was highlighted last year when the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigated consultants' prices. Technology. Cost-shifting from the public sector to the private. Utilisation - the amount of times each policyholder makes a claim. Anti-selection - the phenomenon by which those who realise that they are likely to need private medical treatment are more likely to take out the insurance. In the US last year, these combined to force an increase of 20.5 per cent for 1993. In the UK, medical inflation - as measured by the cost of each claim to the companies - had been allowed to get out of control, but the insurers now seem to be putting a lid on it. According to Arthur Large, chief executive of Bupa, costs per claim increased by only 2.2 per cent last year, following 7 per cent in 1991. This is barely ahead of the rate of inflation. But rising premiums encourage further anti-selection (as those who consider themselves fit decide that insurance is no longer worth the expense), and also increase utilisation of the service. According to Large, Bupa's policy-holders claimed 7 per cent more often last year than they did the year before. But members of corporate schemes - less prone to anti-selection - actually claimed on their insurance 1.7 per cent less than in the year before, and Bupa's company premiums were not raised at the beginning of this year. So, the years of cost-inflation may bring consumers some benefits. Insurers have been forced to offer a wider range of products, allowing consumers to avoid paying for cover for ailments which would be just as well treated by the NHS. WPA, for instance, now has 15 different products with different levels of cover. A family headed by a 50-year-old could pay as much as Pounds 1,442.90 a year, or as little as Pounds 369, for its insurance. According to Julian Stainton, of WPA, the latter only covers 'quality of life' ailments (such as varicose veins), for which NHS waiting lists are justifiably longest, and does not cover acute illnesses, for which the NHS is usually speedy. Watch out for further changes to premium structures. Medical insurance has grown much more expensive, but at last the insurers have been forced to keep an eye on what doctors are spending and to address the needs of the consumer.</p>

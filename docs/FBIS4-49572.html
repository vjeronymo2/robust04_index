			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wu Yunhe: "Capital Spending Speeds Up"] </F>   [Text] China's fixed assets investment might grow faster  than the government's target this year of nearly 10 percent, the  State Information Centre said.    Xu Hongyuan, an official with the centre's economic  forecasting department, predicted that investment in fixed  assets this year might hit 1,500 billion yuan ($172.4 billion),  up nearly 27 percent from a year ago. Last year, capital  spending grew by 50.6 percent from 1992.    Xu believes the higher level is needed because the current  market demand is very much related to fixed assets investment,  which is also a major factor in maintaining high economic growth  in the future, as the government has envisaged.    After a careful study of economic developments and in light  of growing confidence that inflation will be kept at bay,  economists now believe that demand should be spurred a little  bit more than what was targeted at the beginning of this year.    The centre, an arm of the State Planning Commission,  believes  this could be done through larger fixed assets investment.    By doing so, Xu said, the gross national product (GNP) could  expand by 11 percent this year, 2 percentage points higher than  what was envisaged at the start of 1994.    The latest statistics show that while inflation and fixed  assets investment are moderating, personal savings and official  revenues are growing rapidly.    The year-on-year increase in fixed assets investment was  36.2  per cent in March, down 34.5 percentage points from a year  earlier.    The yearly growth in capital spending is expected to subside  to about 32 per cent by June, down 29 percentage points from a  year earlier.    Individual savings in the country's banks are currently  186.2  billion yuan ($21.4 billion) higher than last year.    In addition, the government had already withdrawn 3 billion  yuan ($345 million) in currency during the first quarter of this  year.    The growing savings and the government's active money  withdrawal have helped curtail inflation, which slipped 1.4  percentage points from March to April. Xu said he believed that  despite the rising prices of some agricultural products, the  current market demand is generally weakening compared with the  growing supply of goods, which may dampen factory production as  well as economic performance.    He also explained that the inflationary pressures that have  cast a pall over the economy are mainly side-effects of the  price and tax reforms of last year, and should gradually fade in  the months to come.    As a result, the State Information Centre believes that the  growth in fixed assets investment is reaching an acceptable  level because consumer spending relies on the stimulus of fixed  assets investment.    But, he added that the government should keep a watchful eye  on the growth in fixed assets investment, which customarily  peaks in the fourth quarter.</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Deals in E Europe tending to be bigger WESTERN multinationals are increasing the scale of their involvement in eastern Europe, with increasing numbers of 'mega-deals' worth hundreds of millions of dollars, writes Frances Williams. The United Nations Economic Commission for Europe* has identified 14 joint ventures since early 1991 in which western multi-nationals plan to invest a total of Dollars 10.2bn (Pounds 6.7bn); six of the biggest acquisitions will cost western companies more than Dollars 2.1bn in all. The true value of large-scale deals by foreign companies may be much higher, the ECE says, since the figures are often not divulged. The favoured recipient of these 'mega-deals' has been the then Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, followed by Hungary, Poland and Russia. The ECE also notes that while the prominent role of German investors in the region has sometimes come in for criticism, the groups involved in the biggest projects are often American. US companies - Conoco, Philip Morris, International Paper Company, Kay Universal, General Electric and K-Mart - were responsible for six of the top 10 acquis-itions in central and eastern Europe. The biggest western investor in eastern Europe appears to be Conoco, which is paying Dollars 1bn for a Polish acquisition and plans to invest Dollars 4bn in a Russian joint venture. Most large-scale projects are concentrated in the car, oil and petrochemicals industries, the ECE says. In general, however, foreign investment projects in eastern Europe are undertaken by small and medium-sized companies on a relatively small scale. By October 1992 the ECE had recorded 52,700 projects involving foreign capital of Dollars 12.4bn. *East-West Investment and Joint Ventures News, No 14, December 1992.

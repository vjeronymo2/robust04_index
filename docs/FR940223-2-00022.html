Some sampling is proposed to occur in the floodplains of two creeks near PGDP in McCracken County, Kentucky. DOE prepared a floodplain assessment describing the effects, alternatives, and measures designed to avoid or minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplains. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings before implementing the proposed action. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Information on the proposed action (including maps of potentially disturbed floodplain areas) is available from: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> Mr. Robert C.

A Notice of Floodplain/Wetland Involvement for Environmental Restoration and Waste Management Activities at PGDP was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 5, 1993, at 58 FR 51812, and a floodplain assessment has been prepared; no wetland will be involved in the proposed action. DOE is proposing to collect surface water, ground water, sediment, and soil samples to define the nature and extent of contamination in these media at two SWMUs on the site of the former Kentucky Ordnance Works near PGDP in McCracken County, Kentucky. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ground-water wells and deep soil borings would be placed within the 100-year floodplain of an unnamed tributary to Big Bayou Creek at SWMU 94 and within the 100-year floodplain of Big Bayou Creek at SWMU 95 to determine if the floodplains have been contaminated from past releases from the two SWMUs. Sampling would allow DOE to define the nature and extent of potential contamination in floodplain media. Two alternatives were considered_the no action alternative and an alternative that included performing the activities outside of the floodplain. Neither of these alternatives would provide the necessary characterization information and, therefore, are unacceptable alternatives. The proposed action does conform to applicable State floodplain protection standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Minor temporary impacts would occur from construction of temporary access roads and drilling pads for heavy equipment used to install deep soil borings and wells. Some trees would have to be cut at SWMU 95 to clear new access routes. Existing roadways and clearings would be used to the greatest extent possible to minimize new road construction. New temporary roadways and drilling pads would require small amounts of gravel and rock fill for drilling equipment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All drilling pads and most access roadways would be reclaimed and revegetated at the conclusion of the project. Some roadways would be left in place for continued access to monitoring wells. The number of trees to be cut would be kept to the minimum needed to clear access routes. Standard engineering practices would control potential soil erosion from the sites. Access road and drilling pad construction and clearing vegetation for site access would not reduce the flood storage capacity of the floodplain, interfere with stream flow, or produce hazardous flood velocities. DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the statement of findings prior to implementing the proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James J.

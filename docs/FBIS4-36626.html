			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christian Usi in the Chamber of Deputies in </F> Beirut]    [Excerpt] Editors Doyen Milhim Karam has cited Chamber of  Deputies Speaker Nabih Birri as saying that the government will  be better protected and more prestigious and dignified if it  lifts all restrictions on the audio and visual media, provided  that these media are really Lebanese. Birri stressed to the  editors' doyen that he is one of the advocates of organized  opposition. He renewed his call for General Michel 'Awn to  return to Lebanon. If 'Awn needs protection, Birri was quoted  as saying, I can guarantee him wider and better protection than  that he is now receiving in his place of residence. Birri  stressed that General 'Awn was the one who asked for political  asylum in France, and said Lebanon is prepared to protect him to  practice all his activities in the country.

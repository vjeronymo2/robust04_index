The four gunmen freed the last two schoolboys and a  busdriver  they were holding, at around 7:00 p.m. (1600 GMT). The  helicopter then took off for Makhachkala, capital of the Russian  republic of Dagestan on the Caspian Sea, a two-hour flight.    The officials said the information came from the crisis  center in Mineralnyye Vody. They did not say if concessions had  been made to win these releases. [passage omitted]</p>

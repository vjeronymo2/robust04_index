			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, May 10 (AFP)--A senior Egyptian opposition MP  on Tuesday accused unnamed government officials of ordering the  killing of a Muslim fundamentalist lawyer because he tried to  negotiate an end to clashes between Islamic militants and the  security forces.    Kamal Khalid, a lawyer and independent member of parliament,  said 'Abd-al-Harith Madani died after having tried to give him  proposals for ending the conflict between the outlawed  al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah and security forces which has cost  nearly 400 lives in the past two years.    "Certain circles in the security forces are trying to stir  up" the violence, Khalid told a lawyers' union meeting in the  centre of Cairo, called to protest over the alleged killing of  Madani by security forces.    The Order of Cairo Lawyers said Monday that Madani, who  defended the al-Jama'ah's spiritual leader, was tortured to  death a week after he was arrested.    Madani was a leading member of the defence committee set up  for al-Jama'ah al-Islamiyah (Islamic Group) spiritual guide  Shaykh 'Umar 'Abd-al-Rahman, who was sentenced to seven years in  jail by the state security court last week.  The al-Jama'ah has been waging a bloody two-year campaign to  topple the secular government of President Husni Mubarak.    In a message to Mubarak, Order of Cairo Lawyers President  'Abd-al-'Aziz Muhammad said there were "circles in the heart of  your government who do not want stability in Egypt."    The Cairo lawyers' statement said Madani was arrested on  April 26 and taken to a secret destination. "Not even his  family knew where he was. They only heard about his death on  Friday."    The lawyers said they were "horrified" by Madani's death,  describing it as "an act of aggression against all lawyers."    Security forces arrested Madani during a four-hour search of  his office, in the presence of four colleagues.    The 40-year-old lawyer from Qina in northern [as received]  Egypt was married with two daughters.</p>

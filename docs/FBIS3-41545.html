Located near Nanchang, capital of eastern China's Jiangxi  Province, the station has virtually stopped the invasion of the  surrounding desert and restored the local ecological environment  in the area after six years of work.    Wind and sand in the area threatened local residents'  limited  living space.    Statistics show that in Jiangxi, sandy land covers 32,000  hectares, and that sand is swallowing farmland at a speed of  four meters a year.    Experts warned that the desert was approaching the city of  Nanchang and there was no time to waste.    In Houtian town, near Nanchang, people suffered greatly from  sand disasters. Farmland and rivers were inundated, and the  town was forced to move again and again.    In 1985, the town's per capita income was only 170 yuan (29  U.S. dollars). More than 80 percent of all peasant households  lived below the poverty line. The town owed 1.6 million yuan  (275.9 U.S. dollars) in debts.    To help the backward areas out of poverty, the municipal  science and technology committee initiated a plan of ``helping  the poor by applying scientific and technological advances.''    Cooperating with the Lanzhou Institute of Deserts in  northwestern China's Gansu Province, the committee established  in January of 1988 China's first experimental station on  comprehensive exploration of subtropical sandy land. The  station covers an area of 35.1 hectares in Houtian's most  seriously sand-ridden area.    Comprehensive exploration of sandy land is a difficult  technological project.    Although research on deserts and sandy land started long ago  in northern China, this was the first time to tackle sandy land  in subtropical areas.    The station adopted a method that combined modern technology  with traditional experience. While making efforts to improve  the environment, researchers also paid attention to economic  results.    They introduced many special varieties of animals and plants  beneficial to the environment.    This low-input, high-output planting mode has proved to be  successful. About 91.3 percent of fruit trees and more than 95  percent shelter forests have survived in the experimental area.    Some 93 million fruit trees of 55 varieties are growing  there. This year, the station harvested more than 15 tons of  fruit and earned 190 million yuan (32.76 million dollars) from  planting.    Inspired by the experiment results, peasants living around  the station planted some 200 hectares of fruit trees. Income  per household has reached 8,000 yuan (1,380 dollars).    This miracle has also astonished foreign experts. At the  third world conference on desert control, representatives from  the Nanchang experimental station issued their research results  and won wide recognition and appreciation from international  sand-control experts.    After inspecting the station, the European Community decided  to provide aid of 5.2 million U.S. dollars.    EC experts have started cooperating with Chinese experts in  building model orchards and a personnel training base.    The research results will be spread around the country.    Experts believe that by the end of this century, the deserts  in southern and eastern China will become oases.</p>

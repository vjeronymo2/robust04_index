This is the second time such  discussions have been held, less than a week after the  proclamation of the final results of the second round of  legislative elections. It was an occasion for the head of  state to analyze the country's political situation with the said  political parties prior to the formation of a new government  team.    The five political parties, received in turn by President  Eyadema, are the Rally of the Togolese People [RPT], the Union  for Justice and Democracy [UJD], led by Lal Takpandjan; the  Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] led by Yaovi Agboyibor; Edem  Kodjo's Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD]; the Union of Liberal  Independents [ULI] led by Jacques Amouzou; and the Coordination  of New Forces led by Prime Minister Koffigoh. After the  audience Mr. Koffigoh said he discussed the formation of a new  government with President Eyadema.    [Koffigoh] What I can tell you is that the president  continues with his consultations with a view to forming a new  government.    [Unidentified correspondent] Did you discuss the  criteria for choosing a new prime minister?    [Koffigoh] You know, the post of prime minister is not  a monarchy. It is not the duty of the outgoing prime minister  to define the criteria for choosing his successor. This problem  must be resolved according to the Constitution. First, we have  the prerogatives of the president of the Republic, who has the  power to designate the prime minister from within the  parliamentary majority. This parliamentary majority also must  stand out and make concrete proposals.    RPT Secretary General Vigniko Amedegnato gave a profile for  the new head of government against the background of the  country's new political landscape. He must be a man of  dialogue, a very experienced economist with perfect knowledge of  the country's economic problems, and capable of redressing the  national economy.    [Amedegnato] We have considered the current political  situation and, as the recent elections indicated, we have some  majority political parties, and so, we are not dealing with the  case of a single political party. The RPT has already  recommended that the next government be a national union  government. This is why the RPT holds the view that next prime  minister must first be a man of dialogue. He must be somebody  capable of conducting a dialogue with all political parties --  irrespective of their leanings. In short, he should, as his  predecessor said, be the prime minister of all Togolese. This  is why we insist on this second aspect of the issue.    The third issue we raised with the president of the  Republic is solidity and cohesiveness within the government,  which also depends on the existing cohesion between the  president and the government. So, we of the RPT want the future  prime minister to be somebody who is capable of conducting a  dialogue with the president of the Republic, and who can be on  good terms with him. So, we think that once this prerequisite  is met, it will guarantee peace in our country and at the same  time enable us to come out of the critical economic situation,  which is harmful to all and from which everybody is suffering.  Therefore, it is essential that the prime minister be a dynamic  person, a very enlightened economically, and a person capable of  bailing the country out of the current economic situation. At  the same time he must be somebody who can have dialogue with all  the political parties to try and ensure an effective group  leadership, and lead a consensus government, and we think he  should be someone capable of maintaining a dialogue with the  president of the Republic to ensure to greater cohesion within  the country's leadership. [passage omitted]    UTD leader Edem Kodjo said it is necessary to both consider  the political realities and socio-economic constraints as  determining factors for the appointment of the head of the  future government.    [Kodjo] The head of state, in line with Article 66  relating to the designation of a prime minister, has again held  consultations with us. I can assure you that the consultations  went smoothly.    [Correspondent] Did you discuss the criteria to serve  as guidelines for the selection of the prime minister?    [Kodjo] We tried to develop these criteria a little,  and I think what was agreed upon is quite suitable for us. But  for the moment we cannot give any details.    [Correspondent] In view of the problems facing your  country, what in your view are the criteria that can presently  enable Togo to resolve these problems?    [Kodjo] Well, I am not here to open a debate on this  issue, but I think one has to consider both the political  equation and the socio-economic constraints.    Finally, like those who preceded him, ULI leader Jacques  Amouzou hinted that his discussions with President Eyadema were  in line with preliminary consultations to nominate a prime  minister.    [Amouzou] I met the head of state in line with the  current consultations he is holding with all and sundry, the  leaders of all the political parties including the UDR, and our  discussions centered only on this issue.    [Correspondent] Did you talk about the criteria that  might come into play in the choice of a new prime minister?    [Amouzou] Instead of speaking about criteria for  individual appointments, I rather think that we should discuss  the criteria for the formation of the government which will  govern the country. As I have already said about the criteria,  I think one must put in place a government which will be open to  all sides. For me, this is the lesson that we should draw from  the legislative elections we just participated in. One should  avoid anything that looks like a policy of exclusion. This is  what I just explained to the head of state. I did not discuss  individual problems.    [Correspondent] There is, all the same, the need for a  man who is capable of rallying together all these forces to lead  them as a team after the elections.    [Amouzou] If this is what you mean, here is my answer.  Since you are talking about the prime minister, I think he  should be the prime minister of all the Togolese people and not  the prime minister of certain parties, factions, or regions. We  need a prime minister who pledges security and assurance for  everybody, regardless of tribal or regional origin or political  leaning. I think these are the basic criteria for the prime  minister, who will be called upon to govern the country together  with the head of state.</p>

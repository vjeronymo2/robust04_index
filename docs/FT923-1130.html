			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / Government Bonds: Tensions over ERM dominate activity in Europe TENSIONS within the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System dominated activity in Europe's government bond markets again yesterday. The French franc continued to come under heavy pressure in the foreign exchange markets, forcing the Bank of France to raise its five-to-10-day lending rate early in the day and to intervene heavily. Trading in French and German government bonds was volatile because of uncertainty about whether the French franc would remain in the ERM or whether the Bundesbank would be forced to lower German interest rates in order to help support the French currency. THE French government bond market ended the day lower as concern about the weakness of the French franc against the D-Mark prompted heavy selling by foreign investors. The Bank of France raised its five-to-10-day lending rate to 13 per cent from 10.5 per cent in the morning and intervened heavily to keep the currency off its floor of 3.4305 to the D-Mark in the ERM. The Bundesbank also intervened to support the franc. Although it strengthened from 3.42 to 3.39 to the D-Mark, it later fell back to 3.41. Traders believe that the recent defence of the franc may have almost depleted the foreign currency reserves at the central bank. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent government bond due 2002 opened at 8.51 per cent, and ended at 8.70 per cent. The yield spread over 10-year German government bonds widened from about 110 basis points to 125 basis points. THE plight of the French franc had repercussions on the German government bond market, leading to speculation that the Bundesbank might cut interest rates in order to help prop up the French currency and ease tensions within the currency grid. Dealers reported strong buying of short-dated bunds on the grounds that these would gain the most from a cut in German interest rates. Trading was volatile although the market ended little changed on the day. 'All the trading has been currency-related . . . the big questions are whether there will be an ERM realignment, a devaluation of the franc or a cut in German rates and nobody knows,' said one dealer. The bund futures contract ended at 90.94, little changed on the opening, having traded in a range of 90.78 to 91.12. UK government bonds rose by up to three-quarters of a point with the medium- and long-dated issues seeing the strongest gains. Short-dated gilts ended virtually unchanged as dealers warned that this area of the yield curve may have been 'too optimistic' about the possibility of further cuts in the UK base rate. Index-linked gilts continued to rally on inflation worries, allowing the Bank to sell a substantial portion of its latest index-linked issue. The Bank announced a Pounds 600m tranche of 4 3/8 index-linked stock due 2004 on Tuesday and dealers estimate between half and three-quarters of it may have been sold yesterday. The 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2016 rose from 121 17/32 to 122.00 by late afternoon. Index-linked gilts have seen a strong rally since sterling was taken out of the ERM last week because investors worry that without the discipline of the ERM, the government will be under less pressure to keep inflation down. During the current financial year the Bank has issued around Pounds 2.4 bn of index-linked gilts with a further Pounds 16bn launched in the form of fixed-income (conventional) bonds. Among conventional gilts, the 10 per cent stock due 1994 ended unchanged at 102 7/8 to yield 8.15 per cent. At the long end, the 9 per cent gilt due 2008 rose from 98 3/16 to 98 21/32 . THE Bank of Spain's announcement of new restrictions on capital movements and loans to non-residents boosted the peseta and helped to lift Spanish government bond prices initially. However, dealers reported heavy selling of the bonds later in the day leaving the market lower on the previous close. The introduction of restrictions on capital movements is intended to prevent speculation in the currency and had the effect of pushing the peseta up to the top of the ERM. Under the new regulations, Spanish banks lending to foreigners now have to deposit an equal sum interest-free with the Bank of Spain for a year. The 10-year bond fell from 88.20 on Tuesday to 86.30 yesterday. US Treasury prices were mixed in light trading yesterday following Tuesday's big declines, with uncertainty about the European markets and the outlook for the dollar keeping many players on the sidelines. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/32 at 97 7/32 , yielding 7.478 per cent, and the two-year note was up 1/32 at 100 to yield 3.984 per cent. There was some early selling, especially at the long end, which followed comments from Mr David Mulford, the Treasury under-secretary, who said US officials were not concerned by the weakness of the dollar against the Japanese yen. His comments sent the dollar/yen cross-rate tumbling. Prices recovered slightly on hopes that international investors would choose US assets as a safe haven from the upheavals afflicting European markets, but the long end lost all its gains mid-afternoon following a disappointing auction of five-year notes. ITALIAN government bonds drifted lower late in the day, pulled down by profit-taking mainly in the floating rate sector. The Italian market started on a firm note as the Bank of Italy eased at its L6,000bn repurchase tender, where the minimum rate fell two points to 16.50 per cent. However, concern over the outcome of today's L43,000bn auction of Treasury bills pushed bond prices lower. The benchmark May 2002 fixed rate bond (BTP) closed at 91.81 per cent, up from 91.57 per cent at the previous close.</p>

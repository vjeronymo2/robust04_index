			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jindrich Sidlo: "A Fresh Wind Across Europe: The </F> Czech Government Rejects the Collective Rights of Minorities"]    [Text] "In the Czech Republic, basic human rights are  observed consistently. Therefore, there is no problem with  ethnic minorities here," states Minister Igor Nemec (ODS [Civic  Democratic Party]), chairman of the government council for  national and ethnic groups. The "Recapitulation of the  Government's Attitude Toward the Issues of Ethnic Minorities,"  which was debated by the Cabinet last Wednesday, is clearly  based on this conviction. The issue is a basic document for the  given area. The Czech Republic does not have a special law on  ethnic minorities, and the relationship with them is not even  mentioned in the government's declaration of its agenda. Thus,  the adopted doctrine "summarizes and clarifies the government's  attitude toward these problems" (Nemec). The material was  prepared by the Council for National and Ethnic Groups, where  all minorities are represented. Nevertheless, it cannot be said  that the text fulfills their hopes 100 percent: At the very  least, representatives of the Polish, German, and partly also  Slovak minorities had expected more. Nemec's document defines a  minority as "an association of persons who permanently live in  the CR [Czech Republic], are citizens of that country, yet share  ethnic, cultural, and language characteristics that differ from  the majority of the inhabitants and wish to be considered a  minority." In its doctrine, the government guarantees the  members of a minority the right to develop their culture, be  educated in their mother tongue, unite in their own associations  and political parties, use their mother tongue in official  relations, and participate in resolving issues concerning  minorities. The Cabinet considers all of these rights to be  strictly individual rights. Consequently, it does not intend to  permit, among other things, different rules to apply to  minorities in elections. Only representatives of those  minorities whose parties get more than the five-percent minimum  may sit in parliament. Considering the number of possible  voters, however, none of the present "minority parties" can do  this. Therefore, some of their leaders and speakers are striving  to bring about a change in attitude.    The first to propose a different election device for  minorities was Dana Branna, the representative of the Czech  Poles. This occurred at the end of last year during the meeting  of the Council for National and Ethnic Groups, and the idea was  instantly supported by the former member of the CNR [Czech  National Council], Walter Piwerka, from the Assembly of Germans  in the CR. "Parliament deals with a large number of laws that  could affect minorities, and yet the delegates may have  insufficient information and could easily overlook some dangers"  is Dr. Branna's explanation for her action. "Our representatives  could watch out for such dangers and point them out." According  to Piwerka, the representatives of minorities who hold  parliamentary seats could "influence all kinds of issues and  also prevent all kinds of disinformation in the present  transition period, when a civic society is being formed in our  country, but the Czech nation and the minorities are still  burdened by nationalism." Nada Vokusova, who represents the  Slovak Community in the Council, also agrees with Dr. Branna's  proposal. According to Jozef Horal, of the rival Slovak  Democratic Alliance, it is "absolute nonsense." This would  totally deny the principles of a civic society. "The Slovaks in  the Czech lands are voluntarily living in the diaspora and not  in a ghetto," says J. Horal. He is convinced that, during the  next elections, almost every party will place Slovaks on their  list of candidates: According to unofficial data, the Slovak  minority in Bohemia and Moravia now numbers 600,000 people,  which constitutes a sizable electoral potential. According to  Czech experts, the disagreement with a "ration" for  parliamentary seats is more than the simple attempt to keep a  few unfathomable voices out of parliament. "Collective rights,  which include such demands as the demand for a seat in  parliament on the basis of adherence to a specific national or  ethnic group, is often linked to demands for autonomy in the  areas of education, administration, and territory," says Hana  Fristenska, of the Secretariat of the Council. "Furthermore, the  right to a seat signals that minorities need special protection.  Therefore, if one takes a civic approach, representatives of all  definable groups--for example, invalids or homosexuals--should  theoretically have a seat in parliament. On the whole, one could  say that collective rights are political in character, while  individual rights are a matter of the legal protection of the  individual." However, the chairman of the movement  Coexistencia-Souziti [Coexistence], Stanislaw Gawlik, states  that the government's attitude toward minorities does not  conform with international conventions, which the CR has joined.  "According to the European charter on the rights of minority  groups, minorities cannot be defined as an aggregate of  individuals. On the contrary, collective rights are mentioned.  The charter clearly states that minorities should participate in  power at all levels in elected agencies," says Gawlik. The  answer to whether the Czech legal code adequately protects  against discrimination against all minorities was to be provided  by a special analysis, which the council intended to commission  in the fall of last year. Subsequently, however, the task proved  to be too demanding and expensive, and the idea was dropped.  Minister Nemec admits that, when preparing the materials, the  government was not inspired by any foreign model, but, in  contrast to Gawlik, he considers this to be an advantage: "We  have the opportunity of letting a fresh wind blow across Europe."</p>

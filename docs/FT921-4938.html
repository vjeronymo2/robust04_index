			<p>920306 FT  06 MAR 92 / BT to cut 25,000 jobs over 12 months BT, the telecommunications group, plans to cut its workforce by up to 25,000 in the 12 months from April in response to growing competition and the recession. It will be one of the largest programmes of job losses in the recession. The company intends to achieve the staff cuts through voluntary redundancy or natural wastage. The current workforce of 218,000 typically experiences natural wastage of 5,000-10,000 a year. BT plans to write to all staff in the next few days giving them the background to its decision to step up its programme of job cuts. It made no official comment yesterday. However, one executive said job losses would be higher than the 15,000 expected in the current financial year to the end of March and the 19,000 in the previous year. He said 25,000 was at the 'upper end of the range'. Redundant staff will include managers, as well as engineers, operators and other staff. Mr Tony Young, general secretary of the National Communications Union, which represents many BT staff, said he was appalled at the suggested scale of job losses. 'Clearly, the effects of the recession and the regulatory framework imposed by the government are having a devastating effect on what should be one of the UK's growth industries.' Mr Young said the union would co-operate only if job losses remained purely voluntary. It is negotiating a new voluntary redundancy package with BT. BT has had a long-term programme of reducing staff numbers in a drive to cut costs and improve efficiency. It was reported 18 months ago that the company had drawn up a plan to cut 80,000 jobs over five years - a figure BT derided at the time. However, the job cuts of the past two years and the planned reduction for next year mean the company will have cut 60,000 jobs over three years and will be well on the way to exceeding the 80,000 target.</p>

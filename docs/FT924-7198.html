			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Romania given associate membership of Community ROMANIA yesterday became the fourth eastern European country to become an associate member of the European Community. Associate membership will give Romania greater access to Community markets and additional technical and financial assistance. The long-term aim is full EC membership, an agreement initialled in Brussels yesterday says, but this could take around 10 years and depends on Romania's economic performance. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland were granted associate membership last December. Romania and Bulgaria began joint negotiations with the EC last May, but Bulgarian officials said recently that despite six rounds of talks, they were still some way from agreement, chiefly because of a dispute over access to the EC for Bulgarian agricultural products, especially wines. Community officials yesterday indicated that Bulgaria could be granted associate membership by the end of the year provided it drops demands for guaranteed access to the EC market. Bulgaria is eager to gain access to EC markets for highly competitive products in agriculture, textiles and steel, but has run into resistance from recession-hit EC companies in the same sectors. Differences on trade quotas slowed progress at talks between the community and Bulgaria last week in Brussels. EC officials visiting Bulgaria on Monday said it was up to Bulgaria to accept the association accord as offered by the community and then discuss export quotas, or to prolong negotiations. Bulgarian officials maintain that their country's political and economic performance ranks it close to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia and it is important for its stability to be treated on the same footing as these countries. The IMF has approved the release of Dollars 77m to Romania, the third tranche of credit granted out of this year's Dollars 360m standby loan, the Romanian national bank said yesterday. Romania's fulfilment of objectives agreed with the IMF up to the end of September had made payment possible.</p>

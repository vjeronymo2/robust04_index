			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOUBTS CAST ON YR. 2000 URBAN CLEAN AIR GOALS  </P> <P> Many major cities won't be able to comply with federal limits on smog-causing  pollutants before the year 2000, according to a study released today.  </P> <P> In a report to Congress, the Office of Technology Assessment painted a grimmer  picture of the outlook for urban smog reduction than was offered by President  Bush in his proposals made in July for improving the nation's air quality.  </P> <P> Bush had said his proposals by the year 2005 would bring all but about 20  cities into compliance with the standard for ozone, which is created when  volatile organic compounds from vehicle exhaust and other sources mix in  sunlight with nitrogen oxides that are formed by the burning of fossil fuels  such as petroleum.  </P> <P> The Office of Technology Assessment, which spent two years studying the matter,  said prospects for ozone reduction are much less bright, particularly in cities  such as Atlanta, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Baltimore, St. Louis and  Washington, D.C.  </P> <P> "We're talking about 30 to 45 cities by the year 2000 that will still be out of  compliance," Bob Friedman, director of the OTA study, said in a telephone  interview.  </P> <P> Friedman said it will take another 20 years or more before some cities, such as  Los Angeles, Houston and New York, will be able to meet federal air quality  standards.  </P></p>

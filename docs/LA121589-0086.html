The town in the Israeli-occupied West Bank is revered as  the birthplace of Jesus. Municipal officials in Beit Sahur, another city that  is home to Christian Arabs, also said they will call off their Christmas  celebrations to back the uprising. Beit Sahur is surrounded by fields where  Christians believe the birth of Jesus was announced to shepherds.  </P></p>

			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / People: Withdrawing from Wescol Alan Riddle and David Sutton, who joined the board of USM-quoted steel fabricator Wescol in May, have resigned already, as the stock market turned sour and general business confidence dropped, putting an effective halt to expansion plans. Riddle, 50, and Sutton, 39, had set up in business together in 1988, when they both left Tarmac. Having developed an interest in niche building material products, including a controlling stake in a security shutters and grills business, they were keen to merge with Wescol, which they had identified as a well-managed company, albeit in a problem sector. 'We thought we had seen a window of opportunity to raise money and build it up.' But they had underestimated the grave problems afflicting the sector - with structural steel and building components combine Ward Group, for instance, going into administration about the time the pair joined Wescol. The climate for rights issues also 'fell off a cliff', as Sutton puts it. The previous Wescol chairman John Hicks had resigned in May over an unrelated matter. Riddle and Sutton had lined up 'a well known figure in construction and engineering' to chair what should have been an expanding business. But with their plans dropped, Barry Anysz, a non-executive director since 1987, and acting chairman following Hicks' departure, is confirmed as chairman.</p>

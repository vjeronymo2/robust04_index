			<p>920212 FT  12 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Lack of regulator stalls DTB expansion PLANS by the Deutsche Terminborse (DTB) to expand outside Germany are being hampered by the country's lack of a central regulator for the securities industry, said Mr Jorg Franke, chief executive of Germany's screen-based futures and options market, in an interview with the Financial Times. Over the past two months, the DTB has held preliminary negotiations with regulators in France and the UK with a view to establishing terminals in Paris and London. The UK's Securities &amp; Investments Board has raised no objections to the way in which the DTB is regulated by the Finance Ministry in the state of Hesse, where it is based. However, the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the French stock market regulator, has said that it will only recognise the DTB if it is overseen by a federal authority. DTB's impasse comes less than three weeks after Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's federal finance minister, introduced a package of measures designed to increase Germany's attractions as a financial centre. Central to the package was an unambiguous proposal that the current regulatory system, which leaves each of Germany's 16 Lander responsible for supervising securities markets in its own territory, should be replaced with a centralised supervisory body. Mr Franke said he was in favour of the Waigel plan but did not want to wait for it to be put into effect. The process of establishing a structure which will balance the interests of the Lander with the centre will be time-consuming and the DTB is hoping that the Bonn Finance Ministry will take on the job of negotiating with the French authorities. The decision to let DTB's 72 members have screens overseas is part of an intensifying struggle with the London International Financial Futures Market (Liffe) and Matif in Paris to dominate Europe's futures and options markets. As part of its battle, the DTB is also considering introducing further products to enhance its share of the market. In the pipeline are a future on a three-month interest rate, a future or option on a European equity index, and an Ecu-bond future. The most vigorous competition between the two-year-old DTB and London has been over the bund futures contract, a market traditionally dominated by Liffe. The DTB's market share rose from 6 per cent early last year to over 20 per cent in October and 30 per cent in each of the past three months, reflecting a concerted effort of the DTB and its members to concentrate bund futures business in Germany rather than London. Mr Franke said that, following a meeting of DTB designated market-makers in November, the big German banks had chosen to support the DTB in a 'whole-hearted' rather than a half-hearted way. 'This has had an important psychological effect on the whole market,' said Mr Franke. The surge in business has prompted accusations of unfair tactics, such as the setting of minimum trading levels by some members.</p>

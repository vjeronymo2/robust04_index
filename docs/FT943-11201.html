			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Business Travel: Wristwatches and brown paper socks - Michael Skapinker on responses to his request for tips on avoiding jet lag Do not eat while you are flying was the advice we gave readers of this page several weeks ago. Consume as little food as possible and as many non-alcoholic drinks as you can - and you will never be troubled by jet lag again, we said. Many of the travellers who responded to our request for further tips agree. Most add another piece of advice: the moment you step into the aircraft, begin adjusting to the time at your destination. Andrew Marjoribanks of Glasgow recommends purchasing a watch with two time displays: one with old-fashioned hands and one digital. Set the hands to the time at your destination and leave the digital display on home time. One of the criticisms of our no food or alcohol suggestion is that it does not sound much fun. A New York reader argues in favour of the odd alcoholic drink, provided you have plenty of water. Do not drink anything carbonated, he adds. Others say that the answer is not abstinence, but eating and drinking quantities appropriate to the meal you would be having if you had already arrived. So if the cabin crew is serving dinner when it is breakfast time at your destination, treat the meal as if it were breakfast - that is, do not overeat and avoid alcohol. Adjust your sleep as well. Sleep when you would be doing so at your destination. This assumes you can sleep on aircraft at all. Jeff Bowman, an international tax specialist at accountants Price Waterhouse in London, says the key to better sleep is to fly economy. Try to find some empty seats - the best place to look is at the rear of the aircraft, just in front of the smokers. Most non-smokers avoid this section if they can; Bowman copes by turning up the overhead air jets. Lift up the arm rests (which you cannot do in business class) and stretch out. The Insomnia Cure Group, based in Bristol, suggests that you spend as much time outside as you can when you arrive. It says: 'Nothing does more to acclimatise you to your destination than getting out into the daylight as soon as possible after arriving. The subtlety of light is essential information for the brain, which helps to resynchronise your body clock systems.' Finally, the mystery of the brown paper socks. We reported reading that cutting out pieces of brown paper and putting them in your socks is the way to beat jet lag. You can then eat and drink anything. Lynda Davies and Liz Carr of the marketing department of Imperial College, London, say they tried this on a recent flight home from New York and it worked. Unfortunately, despite working for a leading scientific establishment, they cannot find anyone who can explain why.</p>

They  were warmly welcomed by military district leaders Pan Zhaomin  and Fu Bingyao as well as the broad masses of officers and men.    On behalf of the autonomous regional party committee, the  autonomous regional people's congress Standing Committee, the  autonomous regional people's government, the autonomous regional  committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference, the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, and  the 15.8 million people of all nationalities in Xinjiang,  Abulaidi Amudurexiti extended cordial greetings to the  headquarters, the Political Department, and Logistics Department  of the Xinjiang Military District, as well as to all officers  and men of the People's Liberation Army and their families  stationed north and south of the Tian Shan and along the border  defense front.    Abulaidi Amudurexiti stated: Under the guidance of both  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics and the party's basic line, the past  year was one in which we comprehensively carried out the  guidelines of the 14th CPC National Congress and the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee. During the  year we seized the opportunities to deepen reform; open up wider  to the outside world; and bring about sustained, rapid, and  healthy economic development as well as overall progress in  society. These achievements resulted from the correct guidance  provided by the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and  the Central Military Commission as well as from the concerted  efforts made by people and soldiers of all nationalities who  share a common fate. Troops stationed in Xinjiang have  participated in and supported local economic construction,  contributed to their second home town, and promoted the social  stability and prosperity of the autonomous region. People of  all nationalities in Xinjiang will never forget their  contributions.    Fu Bingyao, deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region  and commander of the Xinjiang Military District, said: Over the  past year, party committees and people's governments at all  levels, as well as people of all nationalities in the autonomous  region, have actively supported army building, regarded the  military as a great wall and soldiers a part of their family,  and tried every possible means to overcome difficulties for army  units. Their efforts have played an important role in helping  army units and organs victoriously accomplish various missions.  In the coming year, army units and organs within this military  district will continue to follow the guidance of Comrade  Xiaoping's thought on army building in the new period and the  guidelines of the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central  Committee in order to make efforts in strengthening the army's  construction in all fields and its combat readiness so as to  provide a powerful security guarantee for Xinjiang's reform,  opening up, and modernization.    Leading cadres -- including Jin Yunhui, Xie Fuping, Feng  Dazhen, and (Simayi Maihesuti) -- participated in this greeting  activity.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Geneva, March 22 (TANJUG) -- The airfield near  Tuzla, a Moslem enclave in northeastern Bosnia-Herzegovina, will  not be opened until Serbs and Moslems agree on how the cargo  will be checked, Sylvana Foa, spokeswoman for the U.N. High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said on Tuesday.    Foa could not specify when the airfield would be put into  operation, except for confirming that technically, the facility  was ready to reopen. Everything is ready, only an agreement of  the two sides is awaited, she said.    The fact that a U.N. plane with U.N. Special Envoy Yasushi  Akashi landed at Tuzla airfield on Tuesday has been interpreted  as the renewal of the humanitarian bridge.    The airfield near Tuzla was closed on May 1992, a month  after  the war in the former Yugoslav [words indistinct] Herzegovina  had broken out between local Serbs, Croats and Moslems.    Tuzla is a Moslem enclave in the Serb-controlled territory.  Bosnian Serbs, who fear that the airfield may be used for arms  shipments to Moslems, insist that their monitors and Russian  peacekeepers check all incoming cargo. Foa said last week's  humanitarian effort was the most successful since the UNHCR  started operating in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The 9,400 metric tonnes  of aid delivered last week almost constitute the optimum level  of deliveries, she added.    In collaboration with UNICEF's organization for children in  exile which is based in Zagreb, the UNHCR has launched an  operation to bring together children and their parents. Foa  said about 20,000 children aged up to 18 were seeking their  parents. They have no identification papers and many of them  are too little to know who their parents are and where they  might be.</p>

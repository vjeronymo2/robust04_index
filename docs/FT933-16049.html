			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Arts: Murray the map-maker - Jazz If jazz must continue to develop and find new ways - and there is not the space to argue that out here - then let it be David Murray who holds the map. More than any tenor saxophonist on the scene today, the 38-year-old American makes bridges between all forms of jazz to arrive at a soulful and contemporary sound which describes new and inviting horizons. As a child and one of three sons on reeds, he performed alongside his parents four nights a week and all day Sunday at the Missionary Church of God in Christ in Oakland, California. As a grown-up in New York he has preached hellfire harmolodics alongside James Blood Ulmer and worshipped in every other musical faith, including the Catholic World Saxophone Quartet, in between. And during this time he has also developed a bewitching, alternately clipped and fluid technique on the bass clarinet. At the Union Chapel on Sunday, leading a trio of Fred Hopkins on upright bass and Andrew Cyrille on drums, Murray's easy drive and endlessly unfurling cadenzas put me in mind of Sonny Rollins. The gusting notes and rapidly exchanged high and low registers making new statements which however abstract continued to swing articulately. As a writer and player he manages to combine the tenor authority of Rollins with the freedom of ideas of Ornette Coleman and the warmth of Ben Webster and still have a use for the energy left over. With Murray compositions such as Off Season, Walk Of the Stars and Hope Scope, the Murray tenor wheedled and chimed, danced sweet and sour. The bass clarinet sound too was a revelation, from pneumatic eructation to velvet didgeridoo: Murray's fingering technique even extended to a percussive effect which replicated a rhythmic Geiger counter. If this trio setting provided a priceless opportunity to examine each Murray phrase in all its pungency, it was also an unusual chance to hear Hopkins' eccentric but plangent bass playing. Unconventional as a rhythm accompanist, Hopkins can replace a funny sawing-the-bass-in-half routine with scary stalking at the drop of a bow. Similarly, Cyrille, whose grounding is in free jazz, can step down from screeching percussion to a blue walking rhythm without a second thought. Ten years ago, Village Voice critic Gary Giddins asked of Murray: 'What must an exceptionally gifted American musician whose art falls between the shores of the academy and the Top 40 do to get the hearing he deserves?' More of the same is surely the simplest answer.</p>

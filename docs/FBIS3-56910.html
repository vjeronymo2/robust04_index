In an interview for UNIAN today, VPU Chairman Oleksandr Mryl  confirmed plans to go ahead with the strike which, according to  him, would be staged in the form of a "first Kiev popular  assembly," since the city administration refused permission to  hold an authorized rally.    According to preliminary calculations, about 10,000 workers  from Kiev's Bilshovyk and Leninska Kuznya plants, pilots, and  railroad employees will gather on Independence Square tomorrow  morning. It is planned to approve a resolution on the Ukrainian  citizens' appeal to support the Free Trade Unions' demands.    According to the plan, the strike will last for two or three  weeks until Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers resigns. According  to Oleksandr Mryl, telegrams of support for the strike arrived  from Lugansk, Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, and Volyn oblasts. Donetsk  miners will also go on strike tomorrow.    Oleksandr Stoyan, chairman of Ukraine's Federation of Trade  Unions [FPU], told UNIAN the FPU does not support the strike and  will take the stand of an observer.</p>

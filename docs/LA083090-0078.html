			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> IRAQ PREPARES TO FREE HOSTAGES AFTER DELAY;  </P> <P> GULF CRISIS: LOGISTICAL PROBLEMS ARE BLAMED. ABOUT 250 AMERICAN WOMEN AND  CHILDREN ARE EXPECTED TO BE AMONG THOSE WHO LEAVE.  </P> <P> The Iraqi government Wednesday laid the groundwork for releasing hundreds of  foreign women and children, among them about 250 Americans, but diplomats said  President Saddam Hussein's decision Tuesday night to free them was so sudden  that logistical problems delayed their departure.  </P> <P> Most are expected to leave today. Sources in Iraq's Information Ministry said a  ceremony is scheduled this morning for the foreign media to meet some of the  departing hostages, whom Hussein had said he was holding in Iraq as "guests" to  discourage attack by Western forces.  </P> <P> Ambassadors from nearly a dozen countries that have sent military forces to the  Persian Gulf -- and whose citizens have been held here since Iraq's invasion of  Kuwait on Aug. 2 -- spent much of the day with Foreign Ministry officials in  Baghdad attempting to organize an orderly departure.  </P> <P> There was, however, considerable confusion about precisely who would be  permitted to leave. It was unclear whether Hussein's announcement covered women  and children in Kuwait or just those in Iraq and whether it included women with  no children here as well as mothers.  </P> <P> Many of the foreigners in Kuwait are reportedly in hiding, and U.S. officials  said they do not know how many of the estimated 2,500 Americans there are women  and children. They said "around 250" of the more than 500 Americans in Iraq  will be covered by the order. It also will include at least 700 Britons in  Iraq, as well as scores of French, Germans, Italians and other Europeans.  </P> <P> The logistics of moving so many people also bogged down the process. At least  one international air carrier, Virgin Airways of Britain, offered to run mercy  flights to Baghdad.  </P> <P> As of Wednesday, state-owned Iraqi Airways was the only commercial airline  flying into or out of Baghdad, and its only regular flights were between  Baghdad, Kuwait and Amman, Jordan. In Amman, two Iraqi passenger jets arrived  during the day, but neither carried foreign women and children.  </P> <P> In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohammed Mashat said Iraq will release male  hostages, as well, if the United States pledges not to attack Iraq.  </P> <P> "Now we have permitted women and children of all nationalities to leave if they  wish to leave," he said Wednesday. "Once America gives us assurances that they  are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq, or aggress upon Iraq, then we  are going to let even men out."  </P> <P> Mashat asserted that Baghdad cannot be blamed for the delays in freeing the  women and children.  </P> <P> "It is not possible administratively that everyone go on the same day, is it?"  he asked.  </P> <P> At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler characterized Hussein's  announcement as a significant step "if implemented."  </P> <P> "We have heard statements like this before, and we hope Saddam Hussein will  have the human decency to live up to his word," she said.  </P> <P> She rebuffed Mashat's proposal about the male hostages, saying, "We reject any  notion that there should be any conditions attached to the immediate safe  departure of all foreign nationals. . . ."  </P> <P> U.S. Embassy officials in Baghdad said Wednesday night that they still had not  met with the more than 41 Americans who are known to have been taken to key  Iraqi strategic sites up to 10 days ago, although they said they expect to do  so today.  </P> <P> "At the moment, I think the bureaucracy is trying to interpret the president's  order and work out the difficult logistics involved in getting all these people  together and getting them out," one diplomatic source said. "It certainly seems  to have been a spur-of-the-moment decision (by Hussein)."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Iraqi pressure on foreign diplomats and civilians continued,  American, French and Japanese diplomats reported. At least nine Americans are  missing and believed seized by Iraqi security agents in the last two days, and  French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said 40 more French citizens  have been rounded up in Baghdad. Bernard said authorities in Paris do not know  where they were taken.  </P> <P> Western officials estimate that more than 300 of the more than 12,000 citizens  of Western nations who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait have been taken from  their homes and hotel rooms by Iraqi forces. Hussein's government says some  will be housed at vulnerable military targets as a "human shield" against  attacks.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Japanese officials reported Wednesday that their last two diplomats  abandoned their embassy in Kuwait. Without food, water or electricity since  Saturday, the ambassador and his top aide left for Baghdad. But the Japanese  Foreign Ministry insisted that "in principle, the embassy remains open."  </P> <P> The U.S. and British embassies in Kuwait remained defiant, with skeleton  staffs, as did more than 25 other European, Arab and Asian embassies, despite  Iraq's attempts to force them to shut down and move their operations to Iraq.  </P> <P> Despite the daylong confusion in Baghdad on Wednesday, there were a few lighter  moments. The Italian hostages, for example -- who were made available for  television interviews from their hotel rooms in Baghdad -- were all instructed  to report to the cultural center of their embassy, where they were shown the  film "Who Framed Roger Rabbit?" while awaiting further word from Iraqi  authorities.  </P> <P> Analysts in the Iraqi capital said there appeared to be several reasons for  Hussein's announcement concerning the release, which occurred less than an hour  after an internationally televised meeting between the president and a group of  Western hostages.  </P> <P> Several Western and Asian diplomats said they believe Hussein felt genuine  sympathy for the hostages. Yet, most added that the surprise announcement also  appeared to be a shrewd political move to gain a higher moral ground before  today's scheduled meeting in Jordan between Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz  and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.  </P> <P> On the eve of the crisis talks, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher  insisted that there is no room for mediation.  </P> <P> Winding up a two-day state visit to Finland, Thatcher, who has been unbending  on the basic issues of the Persian Gulf confrontation, told reporters that the  U.N. Security Council resolutions "were clear and must be enforced." These  resolutions demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait and empower foreign forces to  do whatever it takes to block supplies to Iraq. "The policy has been laid down  by the Security Council. . . . The question is implementation," Thatcher said.  </P> <P> Taking an even harder line was Bahrain's foreign minister, Sheik Mohammed ibn  Mubarak al Khalifa. Speaking to British reporters with touring Defense  Secretary Tom King, the Bahraini sheik declared: "What we want now is a free  Kuwait. . . . We have the right to defend it, and the military option is open  because others do not want to listen to withdrawal."  </P> <P> Officials of Bahrain, whose government 10 days ago approved deployment of  Western forces on its soil, have supported the U.N. stand, but the foreign  minister's remarks, as reported on British television, were unusually tough.  </P> <P> "There must be action to liberate Kuwait," he said. "We will not let Kuwait be  occupied for long. . . . If the sanctions do not materialize, we have the  legitimate right to regain Kuwait."  </P> <P> Although the exodus of hostages did not materialize Wednesday, Asian and Arab  refugees from Kuwait and Iraq continued to pour across the border into Jordan.  At Ruweished, the frontier crossing, the Jordanian government set up a tent  city on an asphalt parking lot, and hundreds of impoverished workers sought  shelter from the blazing sun while awaiting transportation to Amman -- and,  with luck, an airplane home.  </P> <P> Egyptian citizens, the most numerous group, generally were whisked away by bus  to the southern port of Aqaba for an airlift or ferry back to Egypt. But a host  of refugees heading for the Philippines, Bangladesh, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan  and Indonesia were kept waiting because a backlog of compatriots has built up  in Amman.  </P> <P> "I have been here for four days, and no one tells me what to do," said Doy  Gutierrez, a Filipino laborer who worked in Kuwait for a year.  </P> <P> Food is scarce in Ruweished although health problems have been surprisingly few  -- mostly heatstroke. Water is being provided from a hose at the immigration  crossing and by tank truck inside a neutral zone where hundreds more refugees  are waiting passage into Jordan. In this no-man's-land, the Jordanians have  also set up tent cities to protect the refugees from the heat.  </P> <P> At Saudi Arabia's coastal-road border crossing with Kuwait, guards said  Wednesday that they had received no word of the new Iraqi announcement on  releasing foreign hostages. The border post, which a month ago waved as many as  3,000 cars and trucks through its gates per day, remained desolate as  foreigners inside Kuwait stayed put.  </P> <P> At the frontier's final checkpoint, four Saudi soldiers in desert camouflage  manned a 50-caliber machine gun mounted on a Chevy truck, and a number of  green-suited border guards watched through binoculars for signs of life across  the border.  </P> <P> There was little movement there, and no foreign hostages arrived. But a band of  Bangladeshis sitting in the shade of the border house told reporters that their  group arrived Monday, after surviving a seven-hour flight on foot across the  desert.  </P> <P> According to the group's leader, 25-year-old Mohammed Nasser, Iraqi soldiers  had robbed and plundered their homes in the diamond-shaped "neutral zone" along  the Saudi-Iraqi border, where they were employed as farm laborers.  </P> <P> As they fled, the Bangladeshis were stopped by Iraqi soldiers in trucks  demanding food and water, Nasser said. When some young farmers said they had  none, Nasser said the Iraqis turned their machine guns on seven, apparently  killing all.  </P> <P> The Bangladeshis were awaiting the arrival of their country's diplomatic  representative.  </P> <P> Times staff writers Melissa Healy, in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, Daniel Williams,  in Amman, Jordan, and Nick B. Williams Jr., in Manama, Bahrain, contributed to  this story.  </P> <P> JAPAN TO JOIN EFFORT: Tokyo announced a limited aid package for the gulf force.

			<p><P> July 7, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CONFERENCE TO INCLUDE SURFERS, DEVELOPERS  </P> <P> Surfers, environmentalists and others who want to save the waves and beaches  will meet July 21 at Pepperdine University in Malibu for the GeoSurf Symposium  1990.  </P> <P> According to organizers Glenn R. Hening and John Van Hamersveld, the conference  will be the first to bring together all groups that have a vested interest in  the health of the coastline, from wave riders and makers of wet suits to  ecologists and developers.  </P> <P> Hening, who founded the Surfrider Foundation, a surfer activist organization,  and Van Hamersveld, a graphic designer whose work includes the classic poster  for the surfing film "The Endless Summer," said they hoped the symposium would  function as a leadership seminar for all those concerned about the future of  waves and beaches.  </P></p>

			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / PM hails Citizen's Charter progress THE prime minister yesterday took the general election campaign on to Labour's traditional territory with a pledge to put the improvement of the public services such as health and education at the heart of his government's programme. Addressing a conference in London, Mr John Major presented an upbeat assessment of the progress in implementing the Citizen's Charter as a 'blueprint to deliver higher standards' across the public services. He announced details of two measures to strengthen the charter's drive to improve services: the chartermark, an award for excellence in the public services; and a new telephone helpline - the Charterline - to provide information to the public on the charter. Labour denounced the initiatives as electioneering. Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, said: 'When the government promises better services without better investment they simply show what a confidence trick they are trying to pull.' Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, attacked the charter as 'an excuse to spend taxpayers' money on party political advertising'. Government departments have so far spent more than Pounds 5m on promoting the charter and the Citizen's Charter unit in the Cabinet Office has a budget of Pounds 850,000. Mr Major told a conference of senior executives in the public sector and privatised industries that although the Citizen's Charter was only six months old, its effects were building fast. Among the improvements in public service which had resulted were: guaranteed maximum waiting times for NHS operations, with individual appointments for outpatients; annual reports for schoolchildren, and league tables of performance indicators for schools; more flexible opening hours for tax offices, Jobcentres, benefits offices and driving test centres. 'Too often the public are treated as if they were the lucky recipients of a free service,' Mr Major said. 'They are entitled to be treated as creditworthy customers who've paid in advance.' He outlined plans to strengthen the inspection of services such as police, social work and probation by including 'outsiders such as professionals, users, commonsense citizens' in their inspectorates. The prime minister urged local authorities to seek out ways of helping businesses which find that different authorities apply the same laws in different ways. A business that gained approval from one authority should know it was valid for others, he said. The chartermark will be awarded to 50 organisations a year. Schools, hospitals, agencies and local authority services will be eligible for an award, which can be displayed on products and stationery for up to three years. Applications for the 1992 awards, to be announced in September, must be submitted by the end of June. Earlier, the Benefits Agency launched a Customer Charter for some 20m people who receive social security benefits. Mr Michael Bichard, its chief executive, said a survey would be commissioned later in the year to check on progress.

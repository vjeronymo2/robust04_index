			<p><P> November 2, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TV SOAP STARS' SALUTE TO BROADWAY BENEFITS SANTA SUSANA TROUPE  </P> <P> The Santa Susana Repertory Company had something of a topsy-turvy 1990.  </P> <P> Embarking on its second year, the Simi Valley theater troupe found itself still  without a home and looking for performing space on a production-to-production  basis.  </P> <P> Its artistic director, Lane Davies, left his role on the NBC daytime drama  "Santa Barbara" and spent seven months traveling the world, so the company  offered an abbreviated season of just two productions.  </P> <P> Thus, it shouldn't surprise anyone that Santa Susana Repertory's year-end  fund-raiser will lean toward the eclectic. "A Broadway Benefit" will feature  more than a dozen soap-opera actors in an afternoon variety show that includes  everything from Shakespeare to Cole Porter to Abbott and Costello. The show  will be presented at Canoga Park High School.  </P> <P> "It will be a loose and fun show," said Davies, having returned to Los Angeles.  "People will certainly get to see daytime stars in a light they've never seen  them in before."  </P> <P> Frank Runyeon, who plays Michael on "Santa Barbara," will play classical piano.  Joe Marinelli and Todd McKee, also of "Santa Barbara," will perform the famous  comedy skit "Who's on First?" Terry Lester, who took over Davies' role as Mason  Capwell on "Santa Barbara" and is a veteran of "The Young and the Restless,"  and Wally Kurth, from "Days of Our Lives," will sing show tunes.  </P> <P> "Some of these people have done little or no singing," Davies said. "There will  definitely be an improvisational feel to the day."  </P> <P> The benefit will also include a silent auction of personal items from the  actors and an autograph session.  </P> <P> Santa Susana Repertory Company, which produced "Romeo and Juliet" earlier this  year, will finish its season with "A Christmas Carol" at the Bellwood Shopping  Center in Simi Valley beginning Nov. 30. The play will run weekends through  Dec. 23.  </P> <P>  "A Broadway Benefit" is at 1 p.m. Saturday at Canoga Park High School, 6850  Topanga Canyon Blvd. Tickets are $25. Call (805) 582-9000.  </P> <P> </P></p>

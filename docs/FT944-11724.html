			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Robinson splits TransTec roles - Shares fall 5p on warning that profits will not meet expectations Mr Geoffrey Robinson, the Labour MP who built up the specialist engineering group TransTec , has split his role as chairman and chief executive with a fellow multimillionaire. The Birmingham-based group's new chief executive is Mr Richard Carr, 41, who last year received a Pounds 10m payment from Tomkins for identifying the UK conglomerate's acquisitions in the US. Mr Robinson, MP for Coventry North West, will continue as non-executive chairman of TransTec, which has suffered recently from recession in the aerospace industry and deferred contracts. TransTec's shares, which had nearly halved in value from February's peak of 105p, yesterday shed a further 5p to 51p after the group accompanied news of Mr Carr's appointment with a warning that full-year trading profits would be lower than expected. Mr Carr, who left Tomkins at the begining of the year, will subscribe for one million new shares at 55p each. He will be granted options over further shares worth Pounds 1m at a price to be determined according to the rules of the executive share option schemes. In addition, he has been granted further options over 500,000 shares, which may be exercised at a price of 140p within the next seven years. Half of these options may be exercised at 130p within the next six years. Mr Robinson, who had been under pressure from institutional investors to split his roles, said yesterday he was delighted to have secured someone of Mr Carr's quality. 'His experience in running a wide range of industrial businesses under tight financial controls will be invaluable in improving the profitability of TransTec's existing businesses. In due course, his proven track record in acquisitions will enable the group to continue to grow as an international, industrial company.' Mr Carr's annual salary will be Pounds 160,000 on a one-year contract, with no additional bonuses beyond the share options. He led Tomkins to US deals such as the 1988 purchase of Smith &amp; Wesson, the hand gun maker, for Dollars 112m (Pounds 68m) and its purchase the following year of Murray Ohio, the bicycle manufacturer, for Pounds 224m. Mr Robinson, 56, owns has a 16 per cent stake in TransTec worth Pounds 8m at last night's close. Last year his total remuneration was Pounds 285,000, including pension contributions. He said yesterday that his new salary would be set by the remuneration committee, but would drop considerably to reflect his reduced role. TransTec has made a series of acquisitions in recent years. As well as the aerospace industry, it supplies components to the automotive industry - particularly Ford. In the first six months of the year, the group's pre-tax profits slumped by 46 per cent to Pounds 3m on sales of Pounds 94m.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Slavoljub Susic] </F>   [Text] While the long-prepared offensive by the Bosnian  Muslims on the Srpska republic gradually dies down, influential  international players, especially the United States, are  launching a new diplomatic-political-media offensive seasoned  with sharp threats and pressure on Serbs. What is actually  hiding behind this? Here is a military-political commentary by  Slavoljub Susic:    [Susic] It took the hawks from the world's power centers and  influential media more than 10 days to speak up for the  umpteenth time in order to protect the interests of the Bosnian  Muslims, who rushed into yet another offensive against the  Srpska republic. Their initial silence is better understood if  one takes into account the already well-known stand of U.S.  officials that it would be wrong to deny Muslims the right to  fight when they are stronger, when they have more weapons, and  when they are scoring military successes.    Of course, whenever their proteges overestimate their own  forces and get their fingers burned, the Serbs are accused of  responding to the allegedly sporadic provocations with  disproportionate ferocity. This recently happened near Gorazde.  However, had the Security Council's Resolutions 824 and 836 on  the setting up and protection of the safe havens been  consistently implemented, the Muslim forces would have not had  the opportunity to launch attacks on the Serbian positions from  these zones before UN eyes.    Participants in the closed sessions of the Security Council  concluded more than once that the protected zones, including  that of Gorazde, were being abused: that they were being used  for training, regrouping, and recruitment of troops, which are  then used to attack Serbs. This is also confirmed by the report  of the UN Secretariat presented at this week's marathon session  of the Security Council, which states, among other things, that  there is well-founded suspicion that the Serbian attack on  Gorazde was provoked by Muslim military forces in Srebrenica.    Nevertheless, this did not sway the belligerent head of U.S.  diplomacy, Christopher, from insisting on a swift dispatch of  peace troops to Gorazde so that his country could have a good  argument for launching an initiative on air strikes on Serbs if  they, as he said, obstruct the deployment of the Blue Helmets.    Defense Minister William Perry had to thoroughly explain his  statement that the United States will not wage a war in Bosnia  because of Gorazde. Those who advocate the punishment of  Bosnian Serbs with air strikes according to the already prepared  Sarajevo recipe were not satisfied with the explanation of  General Shalikashvili, head of the U.S. Armed Forces Joint  Chiefs of Staff, either, namely that Gorazde is not Sarajevo.  It is interesting, but not surprising, that French Defense  Minister Leotard does not agree with Gen. Shalikashvili's  cautious statement. He wants UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to  decide whether or not it needs NATO's support, and claims that  air strikes on Serb positions would technically be feasible, if  only the political will existed for it.    Of course, one should not be surprised by the fact that the  United States is again generously offering its air force when  one knows that the United States does not have troops on the  hostile terrain of Bosnia-Herzegovina, in the combat regions.  It plans to send them there only once a stable agreement on  peace is reached. In the search for an answer as to the purpose  of a new cannonade of accusations, threats, and pressure on only  one side in the ethnic civil war, we find that this could be a  kind of ground artillery preparation for U.S. envoy Redman's  efforts in Sarajevo and Pale. As we have learned, the aim of his  latest mission is to finally obtain the Muslims' minimum  territorial demands and establish the maximum territorial  concessions that the Serbs are prepared to make for the newly  created Muslim-Croatian Federation, prior to a new stage in the  realization of the coordinated U.S.-Russian initiative for  settling the crisis in Bosnia.    If this is indeed the case, then what is the purpose of  Clinton's National Security Adviser Anthony Lake's threats that  the United States should let the Serbs know that the price of  their intransigence is very high. We believe that he too will  one day be able to conclude with regret that U.S. policy has  failed because it proceeded from erroneous assumptions, as was  concluded by Clarke Clifford, former adviser to several U.S.  Presidents and Pentagon during the Vietnam war.</p>

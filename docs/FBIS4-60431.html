			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Henri Mamarbachi] </F>   [Text] Al-Mukalla, Yemen, May 24 (AFP)--Southern leader  'Ali Salim al-Bid has gathered tribal leaders in this port city  to seek their support for his outnumbered army against the  northern troops of Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih.    Al-Bid was focusing on the Awkali tribe's 20,000 fighters to  help check Salih's advance in the oil province of Shabwah, in  eastern Yemen like al-Mukalla, an AFP correspondent reported  Tuesday [24 May].    But the tribe was undecided, mainly because of "bad  relations" with al-Bid's Yemen Socialist Party which ruled the  former Marxist South Yemen, southern official Muhsin Muhammad  Farid acknowledged.    Farid was named deputy prime minister of the Yemen  Democratic  Republic (YDR) which declared its independence on Saturday under  the leadership of al-Bid, who moved here from his Aden  stronghold a week ago.    "The tribes need time to realise that the situation has  changed, and to rally. They have steered clear of the war since  it broke out" on May 5, Farid told a small group of reporters.    "So they are not budging, and they say what's going on does  not concern them."    The Awkalis' reluctance to fight is obvious at the Hadhramut  Hotel where 1,000 fighters, armed with Kalashnikov assault  rifles and traditional carved daggers, are being housed and fed  during the negotiations with al-Bid.    Sitting on a rock next to his bungalow in the newly-built  hotel facing the Gulf of Aden, one of the fighters bursts into  laughter when asked what he will do. And then he says: "Resist,  of course."    The civil war and the tribal invasion have caused distress  for the staff.    "Last month, the occupancy rate was 82 percent. French,  Italian and German tourists filled the hotel. Now we've just  received a cancellation for a group of 120 French people,"  complained hotel manager Isma'il Zakariya, an Indian.    He has not heard from his family in Bangalore for the past  20  days, as al-Mukalla is totally cut off from the rest of the  world, with telephone and telex lines down.    "I just want to save my skin, and get away from this place  on  the first evacuation," he said.    Six ships were moored off al-Mukalla port, the closest  loading facility to Massila oilfield. The 175,000 inhabitants  of the city appeared indifferent to the battles raging hundred  of kilometers away.    Northern forces have made a "breakthrough" in the oil-rich  Shabwah but will never reach the production fields, al-Bid said  Monday. Oil production was continuing in the Massila field at  more than 150,000 barrels a day.    He said negotiations were underway with the Canadian oil  company Canoxy on revenues, which were usually paid to the  government in Sanaa, capital of the Yemen which was unified four  years ago.</p>

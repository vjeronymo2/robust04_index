			<p><P> February 8, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROSE BOWL FACE LIFT MAY BE A SUPER ATTRACTION;  </P> <P> FOOTBALL: PASADENA ENTERS THE SWEEPSTAKES FOR THE 1993 SUPER BOWL BY OFFERING  THE STADIUM TO THE NFL RENT-FREE, AND THROWING IN ALL INCOME FROM THE SALE OF  FOOD AND NOVELTIES.  </P> <P> In a bid to secure Super Bowl XXVII for the Rose Bowl in 1993, the stadium will  be offered rent-free to the National Football League, which would also receive  all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items.  </P> <P> The proposal, outlined at Tuesday's Board of Directors meeting, was approved  despite pointed questioning from some directors who asked whether Pasadena was  giving away too much to lure football's premier event to the city.  </P> <P> "I don't like to think that we ask for something as supplicants," Director John  Crowley said. "I just feel this is very close to being at a point of saying,  'It's not worth it.' "  </P> <P> Crowley's concerns were echoed by Directors Rick Cole and William Paparian.  Cole pointed out that preliminary estimates indicate the city could receive as  little as $300,000 in direct payments to host the event.  </P> <P> "If we come out netting $300,000, I'm not real wild about this," he said.  </P> <P> According to a report prepared by Deputy City Manager Ed Aghjayan, the city  would be expected to receive a $2-million boost to the local economy, with  $75,000 of it going to the General Fund from hotel and sales taxes. The city  would also receive between $300,000 and $600,000 from the sale of 2,500 game  tickets to be sold to corporations and individuals seeking hospitality  packages. Parking fees and stadium seat taxes could generate an additional  $130,000 for the city.  </P> <P> The city's bid will be submitted next week to NFL officials in New York. The  proposal is the result of work by the Los Angeles Sports Council, an  18-month-old nonprofit group that coordinates efforts among officials from the  Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium to secure sporting  events for the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> As a result of Sports Council lobbying, the area is a finalist for the Super  Bowl, competing against San Diego, San Francisco and Phoenix.  </P> <P> Because the Rose Bowl, with 102,083 seats, claims to be the largest  professional football stadium in the United States, the council selected it as  the prime Los Angeles-area venue. Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and  Anaheim Stadium did not submit competing bids but would share in the revenues  if Pasadena hosts the game, Aghjayan said.  </P> <P> "The bulk of the revenue would go to the Rose Bowl, but the idea is that we  would share with the Coliseum and Anaheim," Aghjayan said. Details of the split  are being negotiated. One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive a 75% share  of the ticket proceeds, with the other two facilities sharing 25%.  </P> <P> When Pasadena hosted the Super Bowl in 1983 and 1987, it earned $300,000 and  $800,000 respectively from stadium rental fees, concession sales, admission  taxes, charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees. In  addition, the city was allowed to purchase 1,200 tickets at face value for  local distribution by directors and other city officials.  </P> <P> But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has  secured more and more of the income, Aghjayan said in his report to the board.  In most parts of the country, the stadium is offered rent-free in exchange for  the benefits to local economies, he said.  </P> <P> Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the  previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL. It would also provide  350,000 square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent  compound for league use. The city would receive about $79,000 from seat taxes,  $75,00 in hotel and sales taxes arising from the event and a share of parking  fees, about $55,000.  </P></p>

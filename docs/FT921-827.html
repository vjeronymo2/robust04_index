			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Arts: Man's intuitions and urges laid bare - Manchester Festival of Expressionism As part of Manchester's recent Festival of Expressionism, a trio of exhibitions explores the classic period of Expressionism, starting in 1905. In that year, four young Dresden artists formed Die Brucke, 'the bridge'. The name came from Nietzsche's rhapsodic preface to Thus Spake Zarathustra: 'Man is a rope, tied between beast and Higher Man - a rope over an abyss. . . What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not an end.' Life would be perilous for these rebels whose naked swimming-parties and 'fifteen-minute nudes' jettisoned both bourgeois morality and artistic convention. Indeed, only Ernst Ludwig Kirchner had any formal art training. Yet why did that matter? In order to regenerate Germany's decadent culture, art needed to be the pure expression of man's intuitions and physical urges. At the City Art Gallery The Expressionist Face: 1905-25 is sponsored by Lufthansa (until 4 May: 061-236-5244). It focuses attention on two key aspects of Expressionism: print-making and figuration. Despise bourgeois society though they did, the avant-garde artists needed to eat. Portraiture found them enlightened patrons, especially among a wealthy Jewish intelligentsia. It has been said that whereas the Romantic artist wore his heart on his sleeve, the Expressionist wore it painted on his chest. Dramatic distortion of the human face, as in Kirchner's Portrait of Otto Mueller, drew the viewer immediately into the psyche of the sitter/artist. The shattered visage of The Wife of Professor Goldstein - married to Kirchner's psychiatrist - was a map of the soul and also an image of the external world. Both the Brucke and the Blaue Reiter in Munich - the circle formed by Kandinsky and Franz Marc in 1911 - considered print-making to be as important as painting. Kathe Kollwitz did not paint at all. Her 1908 etching, Battlefield, is an image of human tenderness in the face of objective tragedy. The print's technical skill (the mother's hand lit up by the questing beams of the lamp) and its pathos come as a relief among a surfeit of images of generalised angst. The Expressionists saw print-making as harking back to the late Gothic period, a time of Germany's unsurpassed artistic vitality. The crudely gouged woodcuts of Schmidt-Rottluff, Pechstein and Heckel, also evoked the much-admired primitivism of African and Pacific carving. At a deeper level, print-making's Manichean nature was the visual correlative of the Nietzschean antitheses which marked the Expressionist outlook. It was a movement characterised by despair and exuberant hope, by a desire to destroy and to create. Like it or not, Expressionist prints speak out with a forcefulness that needs no commentary. How mistaken, therefore, to give each print a banal commentary. Of a Kollwitz print, for example, we told that it is 'one of the artist's finest late self-portraits' and, in case we cannot see it, 'eyes and mouth (are) communicating sadness, but also strength'. A Schmidt-Rottluff lithograph 'relies for its dramatic strength on the stark contrast of black and white.' How patronising to think the public need these crutches. Even more objectionably, the one-room exhibition space resounds to an hour-long television documentary. Rather than overheard cliches about Auschwitz, give me piped music any day. Thank goodness there is no such lunacy at the Whitworth Art Gallery. The scene switches to Vienna and a perfect match between Arnold Schoenberg: Paintings and Drawings (until 9 May: 061-273-4865) and, in the adjoining room, Expressionist Prints by Kokoschka (until 25 April). Kokoschka's print-making takes us from his delightful coloured images of children's fairy-stories through the horror of his affair with Alma Mahler, his war-time sufferings and, finally, to a sense of redemption achieved in his family portraits. The Whitworth is the only venue for the international touring exhibition of Schoenberg. From about 1910-1912 Schoenberg was an amateur but obsessive painter. Famously, Kandinsky admired Schoenberg's art and music hugely. His Self Portrait from the Back was shown in the first Blaue Reiter show in 1912. It hangs in the exhibition, together with the long series of self-portraits, portraits, landscapes, stage-settings, caricatures, and the visionary series, the Hands and Gazes. The exhibition documents Schoenberg's suffering with Alma Mahler, his friendships, and his second marriage. More than this, however, as a group, these paintings possess genuine power. Few will miss the similarity between Munch's The Scream and Red Gaze, the best-known of Schoenberg's paintings. However one responds to the message of an artistic creed which cavalierly dismissed knowledge and skill as mere 'acquired characteristica', Schoenberg's pursuit of an art of the unconscious achieved something unique and memorable.</p>

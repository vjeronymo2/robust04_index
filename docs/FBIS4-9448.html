			<p>BFN     [Text] Blagoevgrad, Rozhen Monastery, April 23 (BTA) --  Acting on an order by the governor of the Sofia region and a  directive by the regional prosecutor in Sandanski (southwestern  Bulgaria), the police took measures to prevent an assembly of  the Ilinden United Macedonian Organization (OMO) from taking  place near the Rozhen Monastery today.    In a press release the regional directorate of the interior  in Blagoevgrad said the assembly intended to mark the 79th death  anniversary of Yane Sandanski (a prominent figure in Bulgaria's  struggle against Ottoman rule) was against the law and  anti-Bulgarian in orientation. The public was advised against  travelling in the vicinity of the Rozhen Monastery. The  regional directorate also warned that it would take the  necessary lawful measures to prevent events violating the  Constitution.    Blagoevgrad police had an anonymous call last night warning  that unless the ban on OMO Ilinden's assembly was lifted, a shop  in town would be blown up. The threat was a hoax.    Some one hundred OMO Ilinden followers gathered at the most.  At the same time, day trippers from Sofia, Gabrovo and other  parts of the country visited the Rozhen Monastery. Believers  lit candles and laid bunches of lilac at the grave of Yane  Sandanski. Prosecutor General Ivan Tatarchev today visited the  monastery.    "OMO Ilinden has not formally asked permission as required  under the law for the assembly near Rozhen on April 24, 1994;  therefore, the Ministry of the Interior will take measures to  maintain law and order in the area," Interior Minister Viktor  Mikhaylov told reporters a week ago. He denied that members of  the organization have been ill-treated or barred from  employment, as Ilinden representatives alleged at a recent news  conference.    OMO Ilinden has been denied court registration in Bulgaria  because its "actions, rules and programme contravene the  Constitution," which prohibits organizations that "act to the  detriment of the country's sovereignty and national integrity,  or the unity of the nation, or that incite racial, ethnic, or  religious hatred" and forbids the formation of political parties  "along religious, ethnic, or racial lines."</p>

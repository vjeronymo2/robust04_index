			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Rotar: "Attempts Are Being Made To Use </F> Russian Resettlers as a Political Force: the First Congress of  Refugees from the Near Abroad Is Over"]    [Text] The first congress of refugees and forced resettlers  from the near abroad took place in Moscow on 2-3 June. The  Sootechestvenniki [Fellow Countrymen] Russian Foundation for  Assistance to Refugees was the congress' organizer. Present at  the congress were more than 500 delegates representing regional  organizations from almost all of Russia. In essence, for the  first time since the breakup of the Soviet Union, the refugees  showed themselves to be an impressive and quite well organized  force.    As Boris Sergeyev, chairman of the Fellow Countrymen  foundation, reported to those present, even now, around 600,000  refugees have been officially registered in Russia. However, in  the foundation chairman's opinion, the actual number of forced  migrants is much higher, since many of them are living illegally  in the USSR's legal successor. According to Sergeyev's  estimates, in the next few years, the number of refugees from  the outlying districts of the crumbled empire will exceed 6  million persons.    The refugees' relations with the Russian authorities are far  from ideal and the congress' course demonstrated this fact  conclusively once again.    The tone of the speech of the Federal Migration Service's  (FMS) administrator, Tatyana Regent, was "repentantly  self-justifying": "Our service is guilty of failing you, since  it answers for both the government and the president and even  for the dissolute parliament." The FMS' administrator frankly  warned them not to expect an easy life and that, in the future,  things will be very difficult. The pessimistic notes which crept  into Regent's speech did not stop her from trying to convince  those present that the FMS' activities cannot be considered  useless and that her department is managing all the same to do  something. According to Tatyana Regent's assertions, several  ministries and departments, under the guidance of the Ministry  of Justice, are currently working on supplements to the laws  previously adopted by the old Supreme Soviet on refugees and  forced resettlers. The migration service is also advocating  having the passport offices subordinated directly to it, which  would make it easier for the refugees to obtain Russian  citizenship and residence permits. Currently, a draft of a new  Russian Land Code is being drawn up in the State Duma and the  FMS wants to set up a special land fund for refugees and  resettlers. The matter of the exemption of the refugees from  taxes and the granting of preferential credits to them is being  decided. Thus, as of 1 May of this year, refugee families  consisting of three persons are being given interest-free credit  in the amount of 3 million rubles for the construction of  housing. The Russian Government is also holding talks with the  CIS states about them paying compensation to the refugees,  however, in the opinion of the FMS' administrator, the hopes for  quick progress are slim. Tatyana Regent emphasized that Moscow's  financial and credit policies in the states of the near abroad  are directly tied to the situation of the Russian-speaking  populations in them.    Unfortunately, the speech's stressed sincerity and  unofficial  tone could not shake the skepticism of those present. It was  enough to look at the delegates' faces and to listen to the  remarks from the audience to be convinced that they do not love  Tatyana Regent here and they do not trust her department.    This purely subjective impression was completely confirmed  by  the congress' resolution which the delegates also intend to send  to Russia's president.    The delegates decreed that: 1. The Fellow Countrymen  foundation shall be recognized as the official intermediary  between the resettlement organizations and the Russian  Federation Government, local organs of power and the various  departments. 2. The subsidies from Moscow for the construction  of housing and enterprises for refugees should be sent to the  Fellow Countrymen foundation.    In essence, the congress' decision transfers all the FMS'  basic functions to the Fellow Countrymen foundation, leaving for  the state structure only the role of sponsor.    It is hardly worthwhile discussing now the how well founded  the refugees' grudges against the FMS officials are and how  successfully the non-state foundation is able to handle the  official department's tasks. Something else is much more  interesting: the refugees' "condemnation" is being automatically  transferred to the Russian authorities as well. In fact, the FMS  is the official structure and its disregard of the needs of the  migrants (as they see themselves) is being identified with the  position of Russia's leadership.    And although currently, the Fellow Countrymen foundation's  leadership is not ceasing to emphasize that the organization is  not pursuing any political goals -- the temptation to win over  to its side the hundreds of thousands of embittered people who  "no longer have anything to lose" is extraordinarily great for  all political parties. It is worth noting that the first such  attempt has already been undertaken at the congress: the  presidium received a note from delegates from Orel Oblast (one  of the signatures belonged to the head of the FMS' oblast  division) with the suggestion that a board of trustees be  established for the refugees under the chairmanship of Sergay  Shakhray and that Tatyana Regent be appointed his first deputy.  And even though the refugees voted down this proposal, no one  knows how they will regard others.</p>

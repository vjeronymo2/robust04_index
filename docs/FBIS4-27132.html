			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 28 (YONHAP) -- Three of the five  International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA] officials currently in  North Korea will leave the country Saturday after negotiations  collapsed on the terms of the IAEA monitoring the North's  unloading of spent fuel rods from the controversial Yongbyon  nuclear reactor, diplomatic sources here said.    "The negotiations broke down because the North proceeded  with  the replacement of spent fuel rods, ignoring the IAEA request to  stop withdrawing them," said the sources. "Accordingly, three  out of the five IAEA officials in North Korea will pull out of  Pyongyang today."    The sources, however, said two inspectors would remain in  North Korea to witness the work of discharging spent fuel rods  at the Yongbyon reactor.</p>

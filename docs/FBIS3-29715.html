He said:    An agreement was reached on the scope of inspection for the  continuity of the safeguards at the negotiations between the  DPRK and the IAEA in Vienna on February 15.    The agreed inspection is not a routine or an ad hoc  inspection under the safeguards agreement but an inspection  proper to the specific status of the DPRK after the temporary  suspension of its declared withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty. Its main purpose is to confirm the  non-use of nuclear materials for other purpose after the last  inspection and thereby ensure the continuity of the safeguards.  His accords with the spirit agreed upon at the DPRK-U.S.  contact in New York on December 29 last year.    At the contact the two sides agreed on immediate measures  aimed at a package solution to the nuclear issue, whereby the  DPRK would accept an inspection required for the continuity of  the safeguards and affirmatively examine a possible proposal of  the South Korean side for a working-level contact for an  exchange of special envoys, while the United States would  declare the cancellation of its "Team Spirit" joint military  exercises in 1994, and the two sides would jointly announce the  date of the third round of bilateral talks.    What was specially mentioned there was that the inspection  of  the DPRK by the agency should strictly be limited to one for the  continuity of the safeguards.    However, the scope of inspection had not been decided upon  so  far because the IAEA Secretariat tried to force upon the DPRK  full routine and ad hoc inspections, totally ignoring the  DPRK-U.S. agreement and the United States unreasonably defended  the Secretariat of the agency, breaking faith.    Under this situation, the DPRK could no longer count on the  talks with the United States but was compelled to express its  official position that it could not but make a necessary choice.    Such being the case, the U.S. and the IAEA Secretariat  voluntarily withdraw their demand for routine and ad hoc  inspections and said they would seek an inspection exclusively  for the continuity of the safeguards, and this made it possible  to decide upon the inspection scope.    We welcome that the U.S. and the IAEA Secretariat have  agreed  to the definition of the scope of inspection for the continuity  of the safeguards, turning to a stance for the solution of the  issue.    What remains to be seen is what attitude the United States  will take in the practical stage of the fulfilment of the  agreement between the DPRK and the agency.    If an agreement on the follow-up steps of simultaneous  action  is reached as promised between the DPRK and the United States,  it will open a phase for the agency's early inspection for the  continuity of the safeguards and, furthermore, for the opening  of the third round of DPRK-U.S. talks and a package solution to  the nuclear issue.    The world is now welcoming the recent agreement. However,  the U.S. right-wing conservative forces and the Japanese and  South Korean authorities alone are crying that full-routine and  ad hoc inspections must be made and even openly demanding a  "special inspection", arguing the inspection scope agreed upon  between the DPRK and the IAEA is insufficient for verifying the  transparency of the nuclear activities of the DPRK. This is a  very ill-boding act.    This cannot be construed otherwise than a claim motivated by  an intention to block the progress of the solution of the  nuclear issue and lead the situation again to an extreme phase,  not by their ignorance of how the issue stands on the Korean  peninsula.    The "special inspection" is one of the main reasons that  compelled the DPRK to declare its withdrawal from the Nuclear  Non-proliferation Treaty and so the persistent demand for it is,  in the final analysis, tantamount to an attempt to drive the  DPRK out of the treaty.    The routine and ad hoc inspections are a matter which should  be discussed within the framework of a package solution of the  nuclear issue if the third round of the DPRK-U.S. talks open.  This matter will never be solved, even though they demand them  now.    The United States should fully discharge its responsibility  and obligations at this crucial moment which has been brought  about with much trouble, thus checking the reverse of the  present positive development of the situation and contributing  to the final solution of the nuclear issue.    If the United States again put the brakes on a solution to  the nuclear issue, attaching an unreasonable condition to an  agreement on the steps for simultaneous action, or resorting to  pressure, it would be impossible to implement the points already  agreed upon between the DPRK and the IAEA and there would be no  more chance as now.    We consistently follow a policy of independence. We will  counter whatever possible cases.    We will continue to watch the future developments.</p>

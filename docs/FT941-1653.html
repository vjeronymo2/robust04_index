			<p>940324 FT  24 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Transport problem must be tackled head on Sir, The policy guidance on transport published last week gives the impression that the government is planning the environment by remote control ('Gummer aims to reduce car use', March 16). As one of the key points of this new policy is to promote alternatives to the private car, it is perplexing to try and understand how this might be achieved through a planning and development strategy. Why not tackle the issue head on? It is even more perplexing when seen against the government's indecision over CrossRail - surely a perfect example of an alternative to the private car in an already congested London? It has been hinted that the downfall of CrossRail may be due in no small part to Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, who has been a long-standing objector to the scheme. A sustainable environment requires the government to have the inclination and the ability to provide real alternatives for the public. As it is, the government's lack of cohesive policy between its various departments on this issue can only cause confusion, resulting in no strategy whatsoever. This vacuum creates the worst possible context for Mr Portillo and transport secretary, John MacGregor, in their efforts to attract private sector investment in the transport sector. S J Robinson, head of planning, Hillier Parker, 77 Grosvenor Street, London W1A 2BT</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Legislation Concerning Electronic Reporting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 22, 1987, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act of 1987, Public Law 100&hyph;203, was enacted. Section 4007  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Public Law 100&hyph;203, which was subsequently amended by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 411(b)(6) of the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of 1988, Public Law 100&hyph;360, added section 1886(f)(1)(B) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, which sets forth several provisions concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reporting of hospital information under the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Section 1886(f)(1)(B) of the Act applies to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> October 1, 1989.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 1886(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Act provides that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary will place into effect a standardized electronic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cost reporting format for hospitals under Medicare. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized electronic cost reporting format does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require any additional data from hospitals. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1886(f)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provides that the Secretary may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delay or waive the implementation of the electronic format  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in instances where such implementation would result in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial hardship for a hospital. As an example of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financial hardship situation, this section of the Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically mentions hospitals with a small percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inpatients entitled to Medicare benefits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On August 19, 1991, we published a proposed rule (56 FR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 41110) to implement sections 1886(f)(1)(B) (i) and (ii) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act. We proposed that cost reports be submitted in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standardized electronic format. The hospital's cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> software must be able to produce a standardized output file  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in American Standard Code for Information Interchange  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ASCII) format. All intermediaries have the ability to read  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this standardized file and produce an accurate cost report.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rule did not require the reporting of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If a hospital refuses to submit the cost reports  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronically, Medicare payments to that hospital may be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suspended under the provisions of sections 1815(a) and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1833(e) of the Act. As explained above, sections 1815(a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 1833(e) of the Act provide that no Medicare payments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be made to a hospital unless it has furnished the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, requested by the Secretary, needed to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the amount of payments due the hospital under the Medicare  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program. Section 405.371(d) provides for suspension of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare payments to a hospital by the intermediary if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital has failed to submit information requested by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary that is needed to determine the amount due the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital under Medicare. The general procedures that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> followed when Medicare payment to a hospital is suspended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for failure to submit information that is needed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intermediary to determine Medicare payment (that is, when a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital fails to furnish a cost report, furnishes an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incomplete cost report, fails to furnish other needed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, or fails to submit a cost report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> electronically) are located in section 2231 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Intermediary Manual (HCFA Pub. 13). These procedures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> include timeframes for ``demand letters'' to hospitals, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in addition to reminding hospitals to file timely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> complete cost reports, explain possible adjustments of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare payments to a hospital and the right to request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30-day extension of the due date. If a hospital believes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that implementation of the electronic submission requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would cause a financial hardship, the hospital should submit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a written request for a waiver or a delay of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements, with supporting documentation, to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hospital's intermediary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Discussion of Public Comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to the proposed rule, we received six  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely items of correspondence. We have summarized the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments and are presenting them below with our responses.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / Shake-up of Pounds 3.3bn milk market goes ahead The government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the biggest shake-up in the dairy industry for 60 years by approving plans to liberalise the Pounds 3.3bn milk market. The announcement ends six years of uncertainty over plans for the sector in England and Wales after the future of the Milk Marketing Board was first questioned in 1988. Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister, approved a scheme by the milk board to set itself up as a voluntary farmers' co-operative called Milk Marque. This leaves dairy companies free to buy their milk directly from farmers from November 1. But dairies still held reservations about Milk Marque's plans for sales under the new market rules, fearing the co-operative would retain too dominant a position. The Dairy Trade Federation, which represents dairy companies, has threatened legal action. Mrs Shephard recognised purchasers' concerns that Milk Marque might abuse its dominant position, 'but the competition authorities will be monitoring them very closely from the start of operations and there is no reason for Milk Marque to act unreasonably,' she said. Farmers who have signed up with Milk Marque have two weeks to reconsider, but most dairies expect the new co-operative to gain control over at least two-thirds of supply. Mrs Shephard said consumers should not expect to pay a higher price for milk under the new rules even though farmers were expecting price increases. She said producers might well be rewarded by the removal of some of the 'absurdities and inefficiencies,' in the present statutory purchasing scheme. Mr Andrew Dare, chief executive of Milk Marque, agreed that there would be slight increases in prices to farmers. However, he said that British farmers received below-average European Union prices. Supply continues to be constrained by EU quotas which will tend to push prices higher even in a more competitive market. Mr Dare said imports would be drawn in from mainland Europe if prices rose too high. The next four weeks will see a scramble in the dairy industry to secure milk supplies. Mrs Shephard urged farmers to sign up by mid-July to enable preparations for freeing the market to go ahead in time for the November deadline. The market liberalisation has been delayed for six months by government doubts over Milk Marque's plans.</p>

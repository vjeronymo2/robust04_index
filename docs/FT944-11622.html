			<p>941105 FT  05 NOV 94 / Russia's deputy PM quits post over lack of progress on reform Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister of Russia and the senior reformer in the cabinet, tendered his resignation last night, saying that economic reform would not succeed under the current government. The resignation comes as international financial agencies are considering plans to stabilise the rouble with the aid of foreign loans. One anxious official said last night: 'There seems to be a constitutional crisis going on.' The immediate cause of Mr Shokhin's decision to step down was the nomination yesterday by President Boris Yeltsin of Mr Vladimir Panskov to the post of finance minister. The appointment of the former deputy head of the president's budget department appeared to reflect a continuing struggle between Mr Yeltsin and prime minister Victor Chernomyrdin. Mr Shokhin said that Mr Chernomyrdin had told him that he knew nothing of Mr Panskov and had never met him. According to sources close to the government, Mr Chernomyrdin had been consulted about Mr Panskov and at first opposed him. The appointment of Mr Panskov is part of the fall-out within the government after the collapse of the rouble on October 11, when it lost almost a quarter of its value against the US dollar. The acting finance minister and central bank governor resigned under pressure from Mr Yeltsin, whose advisers have continued to blame Mr Chernomyrdin's government for the instability. A clearly bitter Mr Shokhin complained: 'The economy has become a hostage to politics.' At stake, he said, was a budget that aims to curb inflation to 1 per cent a month by the end of next year - it rose to 15 per cent in October. The International Monetary Fund has indicated that it might support the budget with aid of about Dollars 14bn (Pounds 9bn). Mr Panskov, 50, was a career official in the Soviet finance ministry, rising to become a deputy finance minister, and has a reputation as a competent professional but not as a reformer. His entry into the department yesterday was an ambiguous one. Mr Chernomyrdin introduced him to his senior colleagues with the words: 'I tell the new minister that a large amount of work has been done on the budget. We will not swerve from the course we have chosen.' Mr Shokhin replied, according to one participant in the meeting, that 'there is a lot to be done'. According to another observer, Mr Panskov also said: 'Now, let's get a real budget.'</p>

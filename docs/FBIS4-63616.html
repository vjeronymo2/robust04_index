			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Moscow NTV in Russian at 1700 GMT on 15  May carries a live or recorded interview with Gennadiy Burbulis,  State Duma deputy and former chief presidential advisor, by  correspondent Yevgeniy Kiselev in Moscow.    Kiselev begins the conversation by saying that many people  of  the presidential team were sacked recently or have fallen in  disgrace, all of them from the Democratic Russia party. As an  example, he cites (?Sabyanin) and Filippov. He asks Burbulis if  it is a chain of coincidences or if there is some logic in it.    Burbulis answers: "I believe one cannot build a vision of a  deep strategy on these two examples. Simultaneously, the  administration has brought in such powerful thinkers as Yasen,  Lifshitsh, or Baturin. These are the president's very good  buys."    Kiselev goes on to say that in his recently published  memoirs, Yeltsin speaks more than candidly about his early  comrades-in-arms, namely Yegor Gaydar and Gennadiy Burbulis  himself. He asks if it means that in political terms, Yeltsin  is now bidding good-bye to his political past when liberals were  his closest allies.    Burbulis answers: "I am not excluding this. I believe,  however, everything is not so simple. Today Yeltsin is looking  for a new social base and a new political structure and  professional environment. Unfortunately, he still insists he is  the president of the entire people, but his personal  psychological directives are not reflecting the real situation  in the country."    Kiselev wonders whether what Burbulis means is that there  are  social groups in the country that do not acknowledge Yeltsin as  a leader.    Burbulis says: "No doubt, there should be a will and an  ability to search for consensus with opponents and the ability  to create an attractive and a convincing environment that at the  same time would be clear for a grassroot voter as well as  attractive for the intellectuals in society. Here our president  is facing big problems today. Yeltsin's prestige was based more  on the idea of a charismatic leader who is able to tackle global  issues personally. This image met the psychology of fast, easy  results and victories over the past. But that time is gone.  Now endlessly blaming communists for ruining the country, or  endlessly praising themselves -- `we are democrats, who had  courageously taken on the responsibility for society and who now  have the right to influence it, because of our political record'  -- all this is no big deal any more, it is all secondary."    Kiselev says this statement seems to contradict the stance  of  his former allies in the Democratic Russia and Russia's Choice  parties.    Burbulis disagrees, saying: "I do not agree with your  question. Unlike you, I can't describe my political allies in  Democratic Russia as former. They have been and remain my  allies. There is a question of a different understanding of the  strategy and tactics of achieving the same human, normal, and  kind ideals that united us in the first place."    Kiselev says that Burbulis left Russia's Choice and that is  why he uses the word former. Burbulis continues: "I have not  abandoned my allies politically or personally. I have come out  to welcome the new political reality in the country, new ideas  and people."    Kiselev presses on, saying that after discovering Gaydar to  political life, Burbulis ended up being pushed out and is not  even a supporting principal any more.    Burbulis replies: "I regret very much not being able to give  a distinct explanation for my recent decisions and having to  constantly put this idea that Gaydar and Burbulis were unable to  share the posts behind me. I think you know very well why I  left the government. It was at the insistence and strategically  stubborn pushing of the opposition and at the demand of  Khasbulatov."    Kiselev says the Yeltsin memoirs give a completely different  version of the reasons for Burbulis's departure, saying that the  president asked him to take a rest.    Burbulis says: "I agree that it is perfectly natural for a  man to get tired and, in that regard, I both understand and  agree with Boris Nikolayevich. It is for God to judge his  opinions and conclusions."    Kiselev asks if Burbulis finds the harshness of some of his  assessments and conclusions offensive.    Burbulis responds: "I'm not offended at all. I think he has  the right to his ideas and opinions. But he should be quite  tolerant as regards the analyses to which I think his memoirs  will now be subjected, because there was a certain human  etiquette and unwritten code in our political relations. In the  case in question, when the president opens the door through his  writings and invites us to express our opinions on the key  problems of Russian history of that period, then we're not  talking about competing with him, but of the moral right we have  been given. I think this will be realized very quickly."    Kiselev asks if Burbulis intends setting up a party of his  own now that he has left Russia's Choice.    Burbulis answers: "I am convinced we do not need at all  costs to set up a party as such. We need to assist the  formation of an efficient party system in the country. This  system is in fact already being formed, but lacks two principal,  essential elements. We have two oganizations -- what they call  themselves is not important. What is important is that one of  them will be closer to the so-called social-democratic program.  So the need arises to form a right-of-center organization  completely loyal to the ideas of the liberals. This  organization, in union with the social democrats, must be set up  not by people drifting from the communist bloc in a desperate  attempt to get votes; it must be set up consciously by people  who have taken on reform and who have a strategy they  understand."    Kiselev asks if Burbulis sees himself as the leader of this  party, or as second man in the shadows, the man who would "push  to the fore some charismatic leader."    Burbulis answers: "I do not see myself as someone who could  be a useful or nice leader, either in a party or state  structure. My experience has taught me that I have skills  others do not possess. But, aside from the temptation of taking  up such a role or post, my strengths, in my opinion, lie  elsewhere -- in my ability to work out long-term strategic ideas  for the development of the country, society, and state."    Kiselev refers to the problem of finding a successor to  Yeltsin.    Burbulis replies: "We suffered from illusions that it would  be easy to find a president who would come along and put things  right quickly. There is also the pyscholgical law of electoral  campaigns and of the society's socio-psycholgical state. As far  as I understand it today, that law requires us to give a clear  and honest answer: if it's not Yeltsin, and if we are speaking  about the generation of 40- to 50-year-olds, the country does  not know that person yet."</p>

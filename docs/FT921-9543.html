			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Leisure side behind rise to Pounds 2.28m at Baldwin BALDWIN, the holidays, printing and properties group, lifted pre-tax profits by 8 per cent to Pounds 2.28m in the year to end-October 1991. The improvement was achieved in spite of a Pounds 616,000 loss at a subsidiary where operations have since been discontinued. The outcome was largely due to Baldwin's leisure division, which made profits of Pounds 1.49m against Pounds 1.08m a year ago. The division's share of overall profits increased from 49 per cent to 65 per cent. Keycamp Holidays, which specialises in mobile home and camping holidays in France and Spain, increased sales by 17 per cent. Looking ahead, directors said the leisure side was continuing to prosper and that currently, bookings were substantially in excess of the previous year. Group turnover fell slightly to Pounds 26.9m (Pounds 27.9m). This reflected depressed performances from the printing division, where profits fell to Pounds 271,000 (Pounds 405,000), and from property, down from Pounds 347,000 to Pounds 218,000. Basic earnings per share emerged at 8.3p (7.8p) and a proposed final dividend of 1.4p makes an unchanged 2.8p total. The company has accumulated more than Pounds 5.5m in cash and has looked at a number of possible acquisitions, although no substantial new purchases were made during the year. Baldwin will continue to look for acquisition targets if they have good prospects for growth, directors said.</p>

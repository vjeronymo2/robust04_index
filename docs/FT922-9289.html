			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Saab reports SKr293m deficit SAAB Automobile, the car company jointly owned by General Motors and the Swedish group Saab-Scania, yesterday announced losses of SKr293m (Dollars 49.8m) for the first quarter of the year. This was a 69 per cent improvement on the SKr953m deficit in the first three months of 1991, but it was a larger loss than the SKr134m sustained in the fourth quarter of last year. Sales revenue rose to SKr3.902bn, compared with a figure of SKr3.365bn for the same period of last year. The company said that the results reflected the 'significant restructuring' which had taken place in Saab's automotive operations over the past two years, but it offered no forecast for the year. Under the direction of Mr David Herman, the company's American chief executive, Saab has gone through a tough period of rationalisation, which is expected to cut the company's payroll by a third over three years. With the help of a SKr5.5bn cash injection from its joint owners, the company will be launching new models starting next year with a replacement for the Saab 900. Saab's volume sales in Europe have actually risen by 10 per cent to 8,500 during the first quarter of the year, with a doubling in sales to Italy. However, there was a decline in sales in the US to 5,626 cars, from 6,581 a year earlier. 'The situation in most of our markets is promising, and we are definitely getting on to the shopping list of more and more prospects who are in the market for premium brand cars,' said Mr Hans Halbach, executive vice-president.</p>

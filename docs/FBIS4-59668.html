			<p>BFN     [Text] Shaykh 'Abdallah al-Ahmar, speaker of the Yemeni  House of Representatives, has asserted that the forces loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih have decided the military  situation in their favor following the seizure of the southern  major base of al-'Anad. In a statement to the Qatari News Agency  over the phone, al-Ahmar said that the crisis has ended,  affirming that the southern units, which have joined the  northerners, are now fighting against the rebellious forces in  the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP] led by 'Ali Salim al-Bid.    Al-Ahmar rejected the YSP's call to form a national  salvation  government and said: This means nobody is running the country's  affairs.</p>

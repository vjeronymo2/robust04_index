			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / World Trade News: UK-German group in aero-engine talks with MTU BMW/Rolls-Royce, the joint venture formed two years ago between the German car maker and the UK aero-engine group, is in talks with Motoren und Turbinen Union (MTU), the aero-engine subsidiary of Deutsche Aerospace, on possibly collaborating in developing a new engine to power 70-100 seater regional jets. Both BMW/Rolls-Royce and MTU confirmed yesterday that the two aero-engine groups had held preliminary talks about a possible collaboration. But they stressed no deal was imminent. The talks have been prompted by Bonn's decision to provide financial support for only one new German-led engine programme to equip new regional jets, including the proposed 70-100 seater aircraft Deutsche Aerospace is planning to develop in co-operation with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy. Mr Erich Riedl, secretary of state for aviation at the German Economics Ministry, has indicated Bonn would support the development of a new engine programme only if BMW/Rolls-Royce and MTU decided to collaborate on the project. Bonn is understood to be prepared to provide DM1bn (Pounds 30m) in support for such a programme. Rolls-Royce and BMW are developing, through their joint venture, the BR700 engine programme to provide engines with thrusts ranging from 12,000lbs to 22,000lbs for new regional airliners. The joint venture plans to build a DM400m development and testing facility near Berlin. MTU, which has teamed up with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US, is working on a RTF180 engine programme for regional aircraft. The preliminary discussions between the BMW/Rolls-Royce venture and MTU reflect continuing pressures for greater collaboration and consolidation in the commercial aero-engine industry, currently facing tough market conditions. The regional aircraft market has been badly hit because of the financial problems of smaller airlines. BMW's decision to move back into the aero-engine business through its joint venture with Rolls-Royce has also worried MTU, which has argued Germany could not afford to have two rival aero-engine makers. Although MTU and BMW are involved in a wide range of commercial engine programmes with Pratt &amp; Whitney and Rolls-Royce, their respective international partners, they have had their sights firmly on Deutsche Aerospace's proposed new regional aircraft collaborative programme with France and Italy.</p>

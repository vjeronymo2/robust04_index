			<p><P> November 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> C-SPAN DOES THE UNCOMMON  </P> <P> No one should be deceived by the English habit of understatement. They are, in  fact, a people given to immoderate and mysterious enthusiasms. Take, for  example, their unwholesome affection for spaniels or their unnerving fondness  for the music of Frederick Delius.  </P> <P> We Americans have our own quirks, of course. Among them is an obsessive  interest in the one British institution the Founders rejected utterly --  monarchy -- and a studied neglect of another -- parliament -- from which so  much of our democracy derives. At 5:00 this evening, the cable network C-SPAN  will provide an opportunity to remedy that deficiency, when it broadcasts the  British House of Commons' U.S. television debut.  </P> <P> Those who tune in should not be misled by the implied dignity of all those  chalk-striped suits, for the right honorable members of Parliament practice  democracy of the bare-knuckled sort. The lines you'll notice running through  the carpet in the middle of the chamber, for example, originally were put there  to keep members at least the length of a sword's blade apart.  </P> <P> There also is more than entertainment value to be had here. While the British  Parliament may not be the world's oldest deliberative body (that distinction  belongs to the Icelandic Althing) or the most raucous (that's probably the  Israeli Knesset) when it comes to parliaments, this is definitely the major  league. Because the British nation has no written constitution or separation of  executive, legislative and judicial powers, as the United States does,  everything happens in the Commons. Parliament has another chamber, the House of  Lords, but like most hereditary aristocrats, they have in this century lost all  powers save that of delay.  </P> <P> Executive authority is exercised by the prime minister as leader of the  majority party (now the Conservatives' Margaret Thatcher) and a cabinet. They  all will be present and vocal in the Commons. Mrs. Thatcher is easy to spot:  She sounds like Ronald Reagan might have, had he done his homework. On a good  day, she is tough enough to kick-start the Concorde. Casual viewers may not  want to waste time learning the names of her Cabinet members, as she sacks them  with some regularity. Levity aside, there is perhaps no more fitting emblem of  this year of democracy's triumph than the decision to broadcast the proceedings  of the "Mother of Parliaments." But why stop there? Perhaps C-SPAN's program  executives can cut a deal with Moscow to bring us the Supreme Soviet in action.  </P></p>

			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Eurosterling issues on course for a bumper year EXPECTATIONS of a flood of Eurosterling issues in the international bond market have been fulfilled during the last few weeks, and the rush does not appear to be over yet. According to the new international bond issues tables published daily by the Financial Times, volume of new sterling Eurobond issues so far this year has reached Pounds 8.1bn, compared with just under Pounds 3bn at the same stage last year, when UK bond yields were significantly higher. In view of the prolific start to the year, last year's total of Pounds 13.7bn of new sterling Eurobond issues looks an easy target to beat. Syndicate managers believe that a total of between Pounds 16bn and Pounds 20bn could be raised in the international bond market by the end of 1993. The overriding reason for the high new-issue activity in this sector is clearly the fall in UK interest rates to their lowest level since the 1970s. This has prompted an increasing number of foreign and domestic issuers to take out fixed-rate borrowings at what they regard as attractive, absolute levels. The Eurosterling sector has also offered attractive interest-rate swap opportunities to borrowers, especially at the shorter end of the yield curve. At the same time, there has been a marked increase in demand from domestic investors for fixed-income instruments that offer higher yields than short-term cash deposits. In addition, an improving outlook for the UK economy, together with sterling's recent recovery on the foreign exchanges, has whetted the appetite of international investors for sterling-denominated paper. 'The time is right for borrowers and for investors,' said one syndicate manager. Several of the sterling-denominated deals rumoured in the market have surfaced. British Gas tapped the market for Pounds 400m, followed by Abbey National, which raised Pounds 650m of 10-year Eurobonds - a record for a single Eurosterling transaction. Last week, the Republic of Finland launched its Pounds 500m, 10-year Eurobond issue. However, syndicate managers expect more non-sovereign borrowers to tap the market before the Easter break, encouraged by the strength of the UK government bond market in the wake of the UK Budget and the latest reduction in German interest rates. A significant portion of the sterling-denominated paper issued so far this year has been raised by financial institutions looking to bolster their capital base. This trend continued last week, as HSBC Holdings and Lloyds Bank both launched long-dated subordinated Eurobond issues, of Pounds 250m and Pounds 200m respectively. Both deals were well-received by the market, resulting in a tightening in the yield spreads over comparable gilts on these issues. Continued demand from investors for high-yielding, long-dated paper has fuelled speculation that the other two UK clearing banks, Barclays and National Westminster, will launch similar deals in the near future. Corporate issuers are also said to be closely studying the Eurosterling market, especially now that the 1992 corporate reporting season is almost at a close. Mr Frank Kennedy, sterling bond analyst at SG Warburg Securities, notes that investor demand for non-gilt sterling paper has contributed to the sharp drop in the yield spread that corporate borrowers have to pay over gilts. According to SG Warburg Securities' corporate unsecured index, the spread over gilts for maturities of 10 years or more has fallen from 153 basis points at the end of 1992 to 130 basis points at the end of last week. 'The performance from non-gilt sterling paper has been very strong, but investors still find the spread attractive,' says Mr Kennedy. He warns that the level of corporate borrowing this year may fall short of the market's expectations, in spite of hopes for an economic upturn. Furthermore, some corporate treasurers may hold out a little longer, especially if they believe that interest rates have further to fall. Nevertheless, there is general agreement among syndicate managers that the sterling sector will be much more active and profitable in 1993 than it was last year. It is too early to say which house will get the biggest slice of the action, and the volume figures so far this year are to a certain extent distorted by the large transactions mentioned earlier. But those volume figures still make interesting reading. At the end of last week, SG Warburg Securities was in the lead, with Pounds 1.4bn, or around 17 per cent of the volume, followed by CSFB with around 14 per cent and Samuel Montagu with 13 per cent. But the real surprise is Goldman Sachs, which has appeared from virtually nowhere (it arranged a modest Pounds 350m of sterling Eurobond issues last year) to fourth place in the sterling league table, with Pounds 930m, or 11.5 per cent of volume so far in 1993. Goldman Sachs is the only US house with a significant presence to date in the sterling primary market. It has also raised its profile by jointly arranging the deals for British Gas, Abbey National and Lloyds Bank. Mr Michael Sherwood, head of syndicate at Goldman Sachs, attributes this achievement to the house's strategy of developing its secondary market trading before going into the primary market. 'We now feel very comfortable in the primary market,' he says.</p>

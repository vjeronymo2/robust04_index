			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter: "Beijing Tightens Control Over External </F> Communications to Prevent Foreign Businessmen From Leaking State  Secrets"]    [Text] As an increasing number of foreign businessmen have  come to the mainland to invest, in order to prevent them from  gathering information on the mainland in the name of investment,  the State Security Ministry has intensified supervision over the  external communications of foreign-funded enterprises.    According to sources, in recent years, some intelligence  agents from other countries have gone to the Chinese mainland  especially to collect information by using investment and  business opportunities, and this has caused great losses to  China. In order to prevent leakage of state secrets, the  departments concerned in mainland China have been intensively  monitoring and eavesdropping on the telephones, faxes, and  correspondence of foreign-funded enterprises. At the same time,  they are also keeping watch on the external communications of  people who have access to various types of state secrets in  important state organs. At present, when mainland officials  discuss confidential issues, they must try to avoid being tapped  by other people.    The sources said: After Hong Kong reporter Xi Yang and bank  official Tian Ye were found guilty by the courts, the relevant  mainland authorities tightened up the management of confidential  documents in various state organs. People are strictly  prohibited from leaking any documents to outsiders classified as  "top secret," "confidential," and "secret," and even some  internally circulated documents that are not classified as state  secrets. The scope of control has been expanded. If it is  discovered that any government officials have connections to  external communications, they become surveillance targets of the  State Security Ministry.    The sources also said that people have found that many  international telephone calls have been tapped. When double  voices are heard on the telephone, this indicates that the  phones has been tapped. Some mainland officials now do not dare  to discuss important and sensitive matters using telephones or  faxes and prefer to talk about such things in personal meetings.    As a number of mainland people have been sentenced to stiff  prison terms because they revealed state secrets to Hong Kong  reporters in the past few years, people who have access to  "state secrets" are very careful about coming into contact with  people from outside the mainland. They are afraid that talking  with people from outside the mainland may lead to the leakage of  "state secrets" and that they may thus be jailed.</p>

			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Russia in Crisis: Uneasy lies the head that shares the crown PETER the Great, the 17th century Russian reformer admired by President Boris Yeltsin had to start his rule sharing the throne with his cousin Princess Sophie. But it was only after he dispatched his conservative half-sister first to a convent and killed her supporters that he was able to launch his reforms. Although the dashing air force general would resent the comparison, there are at least some parallels between Vice President Alexander Rutskoi and the hapless Sophie. In modern day Russia, President Yeltsin finds himself in uncomfortable cohabitation with his vice president. From the very start of the unpopular radical reforms launched by Mr Yeltsin, Mr Rutskoi has shared the throne but led the opposition to his policies. And by occupying this unusual position, he has avoided being identified with unpopular policies. Yesterday, the 45-year-old former Afghan war veteran was even offered the presidential throne all for himself. In calling for Mr Yeltsin's impeachment, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of parliament, said Mr Rutskoi should become president until fresh elections were held. Indeed, Mr Rutskoi no doubt sees himself as the man to pick up the pieces if things go wrong for Mr Yeltsin. But an aide, Mr Andrei Fyodorov, said all the vice president was concerned about was respect for the constitution and that he had nothing against President Yeltsin. 'I see no problems between them. The problems are with the people who surround Yeltsin who put crazy ideas into his head.' In contrast, Mr Rutskoi's former ally in the Civic Union opposition movement, the wily Mr Arkady Volsky, has remained silent since Saturday, clearly waiting to see who will win before he takes sides. Mr Rutskoi even received the endorsement of the head of the Russian Communist party which once condemned him as a renegade for supporting President Yeltsin two years ago. The difference between Mr Rutskoi and Sophie, if President Yeltsin wins the showdown with parliament, is that the vice president will keep his job - although his ambitions to become the next president will have suffered a serious blow.</p>

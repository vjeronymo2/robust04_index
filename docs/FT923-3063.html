			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Steelworkers in recognition row THE STEEL union, the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, which has never been derecognised in its 100-year-plus history, is facing its second derecognition contest. A bitter industrial dispute at the Spartan Redheugh steel mill in Gateshead has led to the sacking of all the blue-collar staff and the recruitment of non-union workers. Even more serious for the union, the Canadian-owned Sheerness Steel, based on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, in the spring successfully withdrew recognition from the 700-strong workforce at the same time as introducing personal contracts, single status between white and blue-collar staff, and performance-related pay. Mr Ian Scobbie, the Sheerness ISTC official, said that the workforce was unhappy about the decision to move to personal contracts, but with very high local unemployment it had been difficult to win support for industrial action. He said derecognition also applied to representing members in individual disciplinary cases. Mr Hugh Billot, Sheerness Steel personnel director, told the magazine Personnel Management Plus that after moving to single status and personal contracts, 'we realised we no longer had anything to discuss with the unions'. He said other companies had shown an interest in what the company had done. The ISTC said there was no evidence for a wave of derecognition cases. Bifu, the finance union, has won recognition rights at the North of England Building Society after a long battle with a company staff association. Bifu has won recognition as the result of a 'membership audit'. Discussions with the conciliation service Acas established Bifu as the organisation with the highest support.</p>

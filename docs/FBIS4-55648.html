			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Hungarian Democratic Forum Spokesman Karply </F> Herenyi by Janos Papp; place and date not given: "The MDF's  Hopes Are Justified -- One Has To Be Able To Step Down"]    [Text] It is very quiet right now between the two rounds  of elections; reports are only coming in from the two  prospectively victorious parties. Our correspondent interviewed  Karoly Herenyi, spokesman for the Hungarian Democratic Forum  [MDF].    [Papp] The MDF has become quiet in the current period of the  election campaign. Why?    [Herenyi] I do not think or claim that the MDF has been  pushed into the background; the focus of the election campaign  has simply been moved somewhere else. Up until now, the MDF has  been thinking in national terms, while we are now concentrating  on local campaign tasks.    [Papp] Does the performance of the 99 MDF candidates who are  still in the contest have any import?    [Herenyi] Naturally, very much is at stake in the second  round. It will be decided here whether the Hungarian Socialist  Party [MSZP] and the Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ] will  form a coalition and whether the two parties will acquire  two-thirds of the mandates. If the electors decide that the  Socialists alone are to govern the country, then the specter of  one-party governing will again emerge. On this basis, I can  also say that if the MSZP and the SZDSZ together manage to form  a two-thirds majority coalition, then the same tendencies may  prevail that I have already mentioned. In my view, the best  solution would be if the MSZP was not able to form a government  on its own, and, even with the SZDSZ, its only possible  coalition partner, they were not able to reach a two-thirds  majority of mandates in parliament.    [Papp] A deputy of the Christian Democratic People's Party  [KDNP] announced that he would not adhere to the agreement  signed by [MDF Chairman] Lajos Fur and [KDNP Chairman] Laszlo  Surjan [on withdrawing some candidates in favor of the other in  the second round]. Will the MDF continue to observe the  agreement?    [Herenyi] The MDF is naturally adhering to the former  decisions. It has to be known that the MDF has more faith in  the electors' wisdom than in ill-considered statements of  certain politicians. People who place individual interests  above all else do not meet the approval of the large masses of  society. It is a fact that the individual view of one person  cannot influence or change an agreement that was made between  gentlemen.    [Papp] Jozsef Torgyan, chairman of the Independent  Smallholders Party [FKGP], has distanced himself from the MDF  several times recently. What are your views on relations  between the two parties?    [Herenyi] In spite of Torgyan's various statements, we ask  the voters who have national sentiments to strengthen the FKGP  candidates' access to parliament in places where they are still  in the contest in the second round of the election struggle.</p>

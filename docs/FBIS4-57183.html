			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Alexander Barrios from the "180 Minutes of News" </F> newscast]    [Text] Colonel Ramon Moreno Natera, second permanent  military judge of Caracas, will head a military court  investigation into the student disturbances in Caracas. Heavy  shooting took place inside the Central University of Venezuela  [UCV] on Thursday following almost five hours of student  disturbances in the street near the university that leads to  Venezuela Plaza. There was machine-gun and light automatic  weapon fire at approximately 1845 on Thursday evening. Two  fragmentation grenades were thrown at the numerous members of  the Special Metropolitan Police Brigade posted around the  university premises. The demonstrators fired on water trucks and  riot vehicles, hitting them over 30 times during the heavy  shooting that came from inside the UCV.    According to Emilio Delgado, who was in command of the  Special Metropolitan Police Brigade, the individuals--who might  be termed subversives--used light automatic rifles, machine guns  with tripods, and fragmentation grenades. Judge Ramon Moreno  Natera may conduct an on-scene inspection of the metropolitan  police vehicles hit and of buildings surrounding the UCV, such  as the bridge over the Francisco Fajardo freeway.    It was also learned that Carlos Luis Hernandez, 21, who has  a  criminal record for homicide, was arrested following the heavy  shooting. He will be turned over to the Judicial Technical  Police and will later be remanded to the orders of the 2d  Permanent Military Court of Caracas, because the weapons used in  the shooting presumably belonged to the national Armed Forces.</p>

			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / AT&amp;T's Dollars 12bn merger with McCaw cleared: Historic telecoms deal beats last obstacle One of the biggest deals in US corporate history was given the go-ahead yesterday when the Justice Department signed a consent decree allowing American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to buy McCaw Cellular Communications for Dollars 12.6bn (Pounds 8.1bn). The all-share transaction will bring together the largest long-distance telecommunications company in the US with the country's biggest operator in the mobile phone business. The deal was originally announced in August last year but had to be investigated by the Justice Department to determine whether or not it could be considered anti-competitive. The department attached conditions to its consent to make sure the merged company did not abuse its market position: McCaw must allow equal access to its cellular systems to all long-distance carriers, including AT&amp;T's competitors, so consumers can use the long-distance carrier of their choice. AT&amp;T must ensure that companies buying the cellular equipment AT&amp;T already manufactures - many of them competitors of McCaw - are not disadvantaged by the merger. AT&amp;T said it was happy with the terms of the decree and that they did not undermine the merger. AT&amp;T invented cellular telephone technology more than 30 years ago and is a big manufacturer of the equipment, but until now it has been unable to offer mobile phone services. One possible regulatory hurdle to the takeover was that, under the court agreement which broke up the old Bell System company and gave birth to AT&amp;T and the local telephone companies, AT&amp;T became a long-distance carrier. The so-called Baby Bells were given the local phone markets. Some Baby Bells said it would be unfair to allow AT&amp;T to enter their markets through the acquisition of McCaw because the break-up agreement forbids them from entering the long-distance market. But AT&amp;T said the overwhelming majority of local calls would continue to be made through ordinary telephones and it was not interested in competing in local telephone markets. Although McCaw is heavily indebted and loss-making, AT&amp;T wants to acquire it because it regards mobile phones as the way of the future. The deal still has to be agreed by the US district court in Washington, and there will be a 60-day period for comments. But it is unlikely to face any further big hurdles, and AT&amp;T said yesterday its would put its merger plans into operation very soon. US West poised for deal, Page 11</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Regarding President Bill Clinton's announcement  made in the U.S. Congress on 14 March on the extension of the  moratorium on nuclear tests until September 1995, Mircea Geoana,  spokesman of the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, today  declared the following:    Romania salutes the decision that encourages the achievement  of the goals of nonproliferation -- above all, the unconditioned  prolongation over an indefinite period of time of the treaty on  the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons -- as well as the  negotiations currently taking place at the Geneva disarmament  conference on a total ban on nuclear tests.    We express our hope that in concordance with the efforts  made  by the international community to strengthen the current  juridical instruments and institutions set up to prevent the  spreading of mass destruction weapons, all other nuclear powers  will take measures similar to those adopted by the U.S. party,  the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>

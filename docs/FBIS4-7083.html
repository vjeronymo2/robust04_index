			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 22 KYODO -- U.S. Defense Secretary  William Perry warned Friday that North Korea will soon be able  to produce "10 to 12" nuclear bombs a year.    "Left unchecked (North Korean) nuclear capability would  disrupt the security of all Asia," he said in a speech at the  Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan in Tokyo.    Perry said in Seoul on Thursday that intelligence reports  indicate North Korea will have the plutonium required for "four  to five" nuclear weapons very soon, but his speech Friday is  apparently the first time he has indicated a north korean  nuclear arsenal could grow so quickly.    Before his press club appearance, Perry met with Foreign  Minister Tsutomu Hata, and Foreign Ministry officials said the  two renewed their determination to get tough on the North Korean  nuclear issue.    Hata and perry also emphasized the need for a diplomatic  solution to the nuclear standoff, the officials said, adding the  two also confirmed that Tokyo and Washington will continue to  maintain close contact with South Korea.</p>

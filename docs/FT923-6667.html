			<p>920822 FT  22 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: UK stock market London equities have been transfixed over the past few days by the headlight glare of grim economic tidings and sterling's increasingly fragile position within the ERM. In generally thin turnover the FT-SE managed a 9-point gain on the week, but there was nothing convincing about this performance. The good news for investors is that shares at current levels are probably discounting lowered expectations for GDP in the second half. Next month's interim corporate reporting season will doubtless bring fresh shocks - not least because it is dominated by housebuilders and contractors - but in key sectors share prices have at last been falling faster than expectations for earnings. No doubt this reflects diminishing faith in analysts' current forecasts. Ford's announcement that it is putting Dagenham on a three-day week from September will hardly help confidence, not least when politicians are back at work to exploit it. The main threat, however, continues to come from a rise in interest rates if the government is eventually forced to step in to defend the pound. With three-month money market rates over 10.45 per cent last night the risks remain acute. Shares will no doubt dip in despair if the worst finally happens - reflecting the inevitable damage to consumer confidence - though more sanguine investors will conclude that such a move would be relatively short-lived and then reversed.</p>

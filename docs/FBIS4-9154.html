			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive statement to Radio Romania" by PLO Chairman </F> Yasir 'Arafat "shortly after midnight" on the morning of 22  April upon his departure from Bucharest Otopeni Airport --  recorded, in Arabic with superimposed translation into Romanian;  translated from the Romanian]    [Text] I nurture feelings of gratitude and appreciation for  President Iliescu, his government, and the friendly and  fraternal Romanian people, whom we thank for everything and for  whom we nurture feelings of greatest affection.    We express thanks for this important invitation which  offered  an opportunity for us to assemble a large number of important  businessmen, experts in economy, and politicians from the whole  world in this world economic forum. During my stay here I have  had a number of important, constructive, and positive talks.  During those talks we approached a large range of problems  connected with the peace process. This important role played by  President Iliescu in the meeting organized between myself and  Mr. Peres is not unusual. On this occasion, we discussed and  approached the problems of peace and the installation of this  peace.    President Iliescu has made very big efforts and Mr. Peres  and  myself were impressed with his points of view. These efforts  will be reflected positively in the talks and negotiations  between us that will take place either in Paris or in Cairo.    We thank again President Iliescu, the Romanian Government,  and the friendly Romanian people, to whom we extend our  gratitude and we thank all of them for this position toward the  Palestinian people. We are convinced that the Romanian people  and the Romanian Government will grant us support and assistance  in the future establishment of our state which we hope will take  place soon. Thank you.</p>

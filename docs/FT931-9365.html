			<p>930215 FT  15 FEB 93 / Italy cuts its cloth to Europe-wide fashions FOR Mr Achille Maramotti, founder and chairman of Italy's Max Mara fashion group, Europe's single market became a reality long before January 1. 'Fashion has become more European. Before, national differences were much more evident,' he says. Mr Maramotti, son of a seamstress, founded the company in Reggio Emilia in 1951. He has built it up to one of Italy's largest clothing groups, with sales of L902bn (Pounds 410m) last year. 'The camel hair coat,' reflects Mr Maramotti, 'was once typically British. Now it is established as a fashion item all over Europe.' All Max Mara's goods travel by road, so swift, reliable delivery is the big advantage of an open market. It now produces 16 different fashion marques, operating from 400 outlets. Some of these shops it owns, especially 'flagship' stores in main European capitals. 'As far as we're concerned,' he says, 'abolition of European border controls is a blessing.' Max Mara started exporting in 1970 and already produces clothes in the same sizes for countries across the EC. 'It's only for the US and Japan that we have to have different sizing,' says Mr Maramotti, 65, who has handed day-to-day management to his three children but still keeps a close eye on the business. The group, whose production is concentrated in Italy, sells in more than 40 countries, with 38 per cent of turnover abroad. France and the UK are its main export markets, with Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands also ranking high among export customers. Surveying trends across the continent, he says Italy has guided developments in women's suits -  moving to 'a slim, confident, comfortable style designed for the professional woman'. French tastes, however, have conquered Europe in more formal women's wear. Even a company such as Max Mara that actively promotes European harmonisation has to adjust for national differences. Buyers of a size 40 jacket in Germany or the Netherlands will get a slightly larger article than in Italy, France or Spain. 'Our customers tend to be built a little bigger and a little taller in northern Europe,' says Mr Maramotti, 'so our clothes have to be a little different." Max Mara's profits -  which reached L118bn after tax in 1991 -  have invariably been ploughed back into the business. Mr Maramotti points out that Max Mara tends to be a depositor with the banks rather than a borrower. He says he started the company when he spotted growth prospects in Italy in the 1950s. 'I saw there could be opportunities in ready-to-wear clothing, having realised the days of individual tailoring were over.' Now, the market has become continent-wide. Mr Maramotti's children 'have a more European culture, having studied or worked in places like London, Dusseldorf and Munich.' Max Mara's prices, too, reflect the reality of one European market. 'In the past, our clothes were usually more expensive abroad. Now we tend to charge roughly the same throughout Europe.'</p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / Amstrad's electronics director lured by Sega offer Mr Malcolm Miller, Amstrad's director of worldwide consumer electronics, has resigned to become chief executive of Sega Europe, part of the Japanese electronic games group. Mr Miller, 39, joined Amstrad in 1979 as product manager while Amstrad was still a small private company run by its founder and chairman, Mr Alan Sugar. During the 1980s Mr Miller, who previously worked for Birds Eye Foods, part of the Unilever group, became one of Mr Sugar's closest and most loyal aides. He is credited with helping steer Amstrad through its rapid expansion in the 1980s, buoyed by 'blockbuster' consumer electronics products such as cut-price compact audio systems and the Amstrad PC. Yesterday Mr Miller expressed mixed feelings about leaving Amstrad, saying it had been a very difficult decision. Mr Miller, who will depart next month, decribed his 15 years at Amstrad as 'very exciting', and said it had been 'a wonderful experience working with Alan Sugar'. However he added that Sega, whose European operations are larger than Amstrad's, had made him 'a very good offer which I could not turn down'. Amstrad is not known as a particularly generous employer, even for its most senior executives. Mr Sugar's remuneration was only Pounds 195,000 in the year to June 30, 1993, and is thought to have topped Pounds 200,000 in the latest financial year. In contrast Sega is believed to have offered to pay its new European chief executive about Pounds 250,000. Although Mr Miller's departure is amicable, he is the latest in a series of senior Amstrad executives to depart. In May Mr Bernard Steiner, Amstrad's sales and marketing director, resigned 'to pursue other interests'. His sudden departure was thought to have been prompted by the appointment of Mr David Rogers, a senior Philips executive, to the post of chief executive at Amstrad. Earlier departures have included Mr Peter Thoms, the former finance director, who resigned in July 1992, and Mr Robert Watkins, technical director, who resigned in January 1993. Mr Watkins, who left to join Binatone, the rival electronics group, has returned to take charge of Dancall Radio which Amstrad acquired last September.</p>

			<p>921207 FT  07 DEC 92 / Scots up in arms over subsidiarity THE British government is being criticised by supporters of Scottish devolution for backing subsidiarity in the European Community but failing to practise it in the UK. Critics say Britain's support for this week's expected Edinburgh summit declaration on subsidiarity - making Community decisions at the lowest practicable level of government - is hypocritical. The issue focuses particularly on how Scotland will be represented in the Committee of European Regions, which is being set up under the Maastricht treaty as a consultative body of representatives from regional and local groups throughout the EC. A discussion paper by Mr Andrew Scott and Mr David Miller from Edinburgh University's Europa Institute charges that the UK's unwillingness to cede power to British regions may block overall Community moves towards more regional representation. Criticism also comes from the Scottish Council Development and Industry, which in its latest policy report, published today, asks how Scotland will be represented in Brussels. Backed by the Labour party, local authorities in Scotland argue they are the only institutions with the democratic legitimacy to represent Scotland on the committee. However, Mr Ian Lang, secretary of state for Scotland, has not yet decided on the matter. Mr Lang's officials play down the idea that the secretary of state - or his representatives - should sit on the committee. The British government says there is no urgency for a decision on the issue as the Maastricht treaty will not be ratified until summer. In contrast, German and French contingents will be made up largely of elected representatives of Lander (states) and conseils regionaux (regional councils). Under an amendment to the German constitution, the Lander will also be allowed representation on the Council of Ministers in areas where EC decision-making affects the German states' interests.

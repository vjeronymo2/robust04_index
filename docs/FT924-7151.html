			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Rosyth backed for Trident refit contracts THE OPERATORS of Rosyth naval dockyard in Fife yesterday fired another shot in their battle against the attempt by the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth to become Britain's sole naval dockyard. Babcock Thorn, the consortium that operates Rosyth, produced a study which said that although there would be economies of scale in concentrating all naval refit work at Devonport, these would be outweighed by the problems of managing a large and diverse refit programme at a single site. It would be better to have two yards under single management, with Rosyth handling all submarine work and Devonport dealing with surface warships, Professor Donald MacKay of Pieda, the Edinburgh-based economic consultants, says. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, is expected to announce next month his decision on which of the two yards will refit the new Trident submarines. If Rosyth loses the contract it is expected that it will eventually close, with the loss of 4,000 jobs. Pieda says that if Devonport were to become the sole naval dockyard, there would be problems of co-ordination and control of the 6,000-strong workforce spread over 100 sites, with reduced flexibility and responsiveness. The power of unions would be increased and this could lead to more rigid working practices and demands for higher pay. The trend in US and UK companies was to go for smaller, focused units rather than single large ones, Pieda says. Rosyth refits all Polaris submarines as well as some surface ships, and Pounds 120m has already been spent on building a facility to refit Trident submarines. Using existing facilities Babcock Thorn believes it could handle all the navy's submarine work by 1994. Devonport could not do this until 1997, giving Rosyth an advantage worth Pounds 150m to the Ministry of Defence. This figure tips the balance in the cost/benefit analysis of the two options sharply in favour of Rosyth. Pieda notes, however, that the Ministry of Defence believes it could not reschedule its refit plans to realise these savings. It says: 'We find this a quite extraordinary and unacceptable argument.'

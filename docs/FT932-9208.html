			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / International Company News: Gambro ahead at SKr220m GAMBRO, the Swedish medical equipment maker, increased first-quarter profits to SKr220m (Dollars 29.7m) from SKr176m as sales rose 42 per cent to SKr2.1bn, writes Christopher Brown-Humes in Stockholm. It expects full-year profit to exceed last year's SKr753m. Profit per share rose to SKr4.61 from SKr3.72. The group said the full-year result would benefit from the weaker krona.</p>

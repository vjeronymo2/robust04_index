			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> QUAKE ASSISTANCE  </P> <P> During the days following the Northern California earthquake, The Salvation  Army received hundreds of thousands of dollars and literally tons of donated  items: food, clothing, tents, flashlights and batteries, generators -- the list  is endless.  </P> <P> To those of you in Southern California who gave so generously, I want to offer  my sincerest thanks for your support. Already your aid has assisted in helping  serve over 6,000 meals daily to those left homeless, countless other meals to  police, firefighters and rescue workers, clothing, tents, blankets and food to  those in need. One hundred percent of the funds donated for quake relief go  directly to our ongoing work in Northern California.  </P> <P> Because of the generosity of Southern Californians, those in Northern  California are able to rebuild their lives. The need is great and the work  continues. Because of your help, we are able to bring comfort and assistance to  our neighbors. May God bless you.  </P> <P> LT. COL. DAVID P. RILEY  </P> <P> Division Commander  </P> <P> The Salvation Army  </P> <P> Southern California Division  </P></p>

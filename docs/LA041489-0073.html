			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> The Irish Republican Army apologized for a bombing that killed a Roman Catholic  woman and wounded more than 30 other people in an attack minutes before the  outlawed group tried to telephone a warning to the Northern Ireland town of  Warren Point. A statement by the IRA, which is fighting to unite the province  with the Irish Republic, admitted that one of its men may have prematurely  detonated the 1,500-pound bomb. Police said some buildings were leveled and  more than 200 homes and 13 small businesses were badly damaged. The IRA  admission made the victim, 20-year-old Joanne Reilly, the 29th civilian killed  by mistake by the outlawed group since late 1987.  </P></p>

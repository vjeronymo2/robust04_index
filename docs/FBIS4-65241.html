			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- According to government spokesman  Dieter Vogel, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's visit to the  Federal Republic, which ends today, confirms the good and  cooperative relations between the countries both in its course  and its outcome. The Russian side appreciated Germany's efforts  to include Russia in the West's security and economic  cooperation, Vogel said in Bonn today. Russia's inclusion in  NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative is already "well under  way," and the extension of the leading G-7 industrial countries  to include Russia will continue, initially politically and later  economically.    The issue of bidding farewell to the [Russian] troops, on  which there has been heated public debate in both countries, was  one problem that was "speedily resolved in the spirit of mutual  understanding." Before a cultural function in Weimar there will  now be an official farewell ceremony for the troops in Berlin.</p>

			<p>930504 FT  04 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Aiming to carve out a niche in the market - RJB Mining sees a promising future in the UK coal industry. David Lascelles reports on its pending flotation' WE'RE THE most efficient coal miners in the country,' boasts Richard Budge as he strides, a hard-hatted burly figure, across the Northumberland countryside. Before him lies a gigantic hole in the ground. At the bottom, a 1,600-ton dragline scoops up dirt in 50-ton bucketfuls. Dump trucks capable of carrying 185 tons at a time growl their way along muddy tracks. This is Colliersdean, one of the UK's largest open cast mines, operated on behalf of British Coal by RJB Mining, Mr Budge's company. Over the past month, scores of City visitors have come to peer into its grey depths as a prelude to the flotation of RJB on the Stock Exchange. The pathfinder prospectus is due out later this week. Mr Budge's boast may not seem too startling in an industry where British Coal sets the pace. And even if RJB's Pounds 100m worth of high grade equipment enables it to compete with imported coal, what future is there in a business seemingly in such steep decline? The answer, according to Mr Budge, is that the government's White Paper, far from sounding the death knell of coal, will open up big opportunities for the efficient producer. He believes that RJB can grow even as the UK coal industry shrinks to maybe only half of its former size. RJB was born as a separate company only a year ago, when it emerged through a management buy-out from AF Budge, a construction and mining company run by Mr Budge's older brother Tony, since placed in receivership. The Pounds 106m deal was financed by Schroder Ventures (about 50 per cent), Charterhouse (25 per cent), Midland Montagu (5 per cent), with Mr Budge owning 20 per cent, and the rest of management a small fraction. The company now operates 11 open cast sites, nine of them on behalf of British Coal, and two in its own right. It also has two underground mines, and various ancillary activities such as coal washing. Last year's turnover amounted to Pounds 73m. The operating profit was Pounds 16.4m, but the cost of financing the buy-out debt reduced the pre-tax profit to Pounds 11m. The after-tax result was Pounds 7.3m. But though these figures point to a strong financial performance, how will the market react to a company in a waning industry, subject to political and environmental pressures, to say nothing of foreign producers mining thick seams at a fraction of the cost? Mr Budge, who is 46, has a jovial disregard for these objections. His vision of the future rests on the many advantages which he thinks the upheavals in coal can bring to companies like RJB. The first is that laws restricting the size of the private coal industry will be lifted - as promised in the White Paper. These currently limit the output of mines to 250,000 tonnes, and the number of men underground to 150. The second is that the private sector will be allowed to bid for mines which British Coal intends to close down. Mr Budge says he has his eye on 11 of these, though he declines to identify them ahead of the purchase negotiations. The third is that RJB can be a lot more efficient than British Coal, and thus transform British Coal's uneconomic pits into money-spinners. As an example, he cites the Blenkinsopp colliery in Cumbria, which RJB bought in 1990. At the time, the two pits there were producing 80,000 tonnes a year with a workforce of 76. They now produce 160,000 tonnes with 90 men. Open cast mining also represents the low-cost end of the business. A pit like Colliersdean produces coal at 80p a gigajoule, compared with between Pounds 1 and Pounds 1.20 for imported coal, and Pounds 1.33 to Pounds 1.51 for coal sold to electricity generators under long-term contract. Although environmentalists are trying to get open cast mining stopped, the White Paper says permission should not be withheld from economic pits. Open cast coal is also needed to blend with deep mined coal. The fourth is that the private sector will be able to expand its sales to the electricity generation industry. Mr Budge has his eye on a share of the 8m to 12m tonnes a year of additional coal which the generators are expected to buy over and above the five-year contracts which have already been negotiated. This supplementary coal would attract the promised government subsidy. But Mr Budge also sees prospects for expanding sales to the domestic, industrial and smokeless fuel markets - and even forging a direct business link with a power generator. RJB expects to be selling between 600,000 and 700,000 tonnes of coal by 1995, up from 350,000 to 450,000 this year. The growth prospects for the company thus depend greatly on Mr Budge's success in seizing the new opportunities. But the prospectus will not flesh them out in detail. Mr Budge says he wants investors to judge the company on its current merits, and make their own assessments about what the future might hold. Mr Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Hoare Govett, says that RJB's expansion plans face significant hurdles, for example in obtaining planning consent for mines, and negotiating the legal complexities of buying redundant pits from British Coal. The flotation is expected to value the company at between Pounds 100m and Pounds 110m. This would pay off some of the venture capitalists and allow the company to get its gearing down to the 30 to 40 per cent which Mr Budge is aiming for. The prospectus will make clear that the flotation is not intended to raise funds for future acquisitions, so investors should expect to be approached again if there is a big deal in the offing.</p>

			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei starts new fiscal year on easier note Tokyo THE Nikkei average had an early gain reversed in dull trading as investors refrained from activity on the first trading day for the April account and the new fiscal year, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-issue average lost 341.29 on balance at 19,885.49 after setting a high for the day of 20,350.66 in the morning and later falling to the session's low of 19,885.29. Volume dropped to 180m shares from 350m as year-end activity petered out. Foreign investors, who have been leading buyers of lower-priced blue chips, were also absent. Declines finally led advances by 500 to 432, with 144 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks dipped 2.02 to 1,446.76, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 2.71 to 1,131.99. A stronger futures market initially led the Nikkei index higher, but scattered selling later depressed share prices. Traders, who had hoped that individuals and investment trusts would start buying for the April account, were disappointed. Dealers put the decline in the Nikkei down to sharp falls of low-liquidity component stocks. These had previously been relatively firm while leading blue chips had fallen, since arbitrageurs held the issues in their baskets. However, persistent rumours that the issues will be replaced in the Nikkei average triggered liquidation. Godo Shusei weakened Y200 to Y1,270 and Shimura Kako lost Y100 to Y880. Okamoto Industries, the leading condom maker, gained Y10 to Y1,180 as investors were encouraged by the lifting of margin trading restrictions by Japan Securities Finance, which is closely linked with the Tokyo Stock Exchange. High-technology issues were weaker on news that a US company had filed a suit for damages against some Japanese electronics makers on alleged patent infringement charges. Sony fell Y110 to Y4,040 and Matsushita Electric Industrial slipped Y20 to Y1,280. Rumours that funds from the bribery scandal involving Sagawa Kyubin, the package delivery company, were used to rig speculative issues depressed speculative favourites. Clarion suffered a setback of Y140 to Y1,040 and Nippon Carbon dropped Y300 to Y1,230. In Osaka, the OSE average eased 14.60 to 21,526.50 in volume of 73.5m shares. The index rose on early buying by dealers, but then lost ground on small-lot selling. Trading volume, lifted of late by cross-trades for year-end book closing, declined on the first trading day for the new fiscal year. Roundup THE FALL in Tokyo weighed on some Pacific Rim markets. HONG KONG sentiment was dampened by rumours of a possible rights issue by Jardine Strategic. The Hang Seng index receded 14.52 to 5,037.71 in turnover of HKDollars 2.58bn, against HKDollars 2.28bn. Jardine Strategic was 10 cents lower at HKDollars 22.30 ahead of 1991 results. AUSTRALIA closed at its worst level this year, with the All Ordinaries index off 10.8 at 1,571.2 in ADollars 190.8m turnover. NEW ZEALAND fell a further 1.45 per cent to its lowest point since last August. The NZSE-40 index finished 20.40 down at 1,390.60 amid turnover of NZDollars 15m. SINGAPORE declined on disappointing corporate results, the Straits Times Industrial index losing 9.94 to 1,439.72 in volume of 33.8m shares. Overseas-Chinese Banking, on announcing a smaller than forecast rise in group net profits, shed 15 cents to SDollars 8.95. KUALA LUMPUR featured the debut of the car maker Proton, which ended at MDollars 6.60 for a premium of MDollars 1.60 over the offer price. The composite index, however, closed 3.13 lower at 604.27 in volume of 59m shares, up from 38.8m. TAIWAN was encouraged by a statement late on Wednesday that the future president will be chosen through direct election. The weighted index rose 71.29 to 4,792.54 as turnover improved to TDollars 20.31bn. SEOUL's index fell below 600 on a report that the government was working on measures to restrain expansion of business conglomerates, but rebounded on buying by the Stock Market Stabilisation Fund to end at 611.70, up 3.87. Turnover came to Won442.4bn. MANILA surrendered early gains to profit-taking. The composite index was off 2.35 on the day at 1,086.60 in turnover of 39m pesos, after 55m pesos.</p>

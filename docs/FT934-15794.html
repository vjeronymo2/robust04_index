			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / International Company News: Shares in Dutch financial group jump to record SHARES in ING, the Dutch financial services group, rose to a record level yesterday on news that the government had sold its stake of nearly 7 per cent in the company to a large domestic pension fund. PGGM, the healthcare workers' pension fund, bought the shares, worth Fl 1.27bn (Dollars 690m), as a long-term investment. The transaction makes PGGM the largest single investor in ING, just ahead of insurance companies Aegon and Amev. The 17.67m shares were sold for Fl 71.64 each, a discount of about Fl 3 to ING's average share price of Fl 74.66 in the 10 trading days up to October 5. The shares made further gains in the days leading up to the announcement. The shares closed yesterday at Fl 77.90, up Fl 0.80 as traders welcomed the sale of shares that had been overhanging the market.</p>

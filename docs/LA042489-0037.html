			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> EC Freezes Farm Prices: Agriculture ministers in the European Economic  Community have agreed to freeze most farm prices within its 12 nations to keep  the farm budget at $33 billion. After a weeklong debate, the 12 EEC ministers  agreed to keep price supports generally at last year's levels. The biggest cut  will be made in guarantees to growers of citrus fruits, down 7.5%. Prices for  sugar will drop by 2%, although the community's executive commission had  requested a 5% cut. A tax on the production of surplus milk will be reduced by  25%, a move that milk producers had supported. The EEC farm budget is more than  60% of the organization's total budget.  </P></p>

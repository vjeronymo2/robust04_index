			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Replying to journalists'  questions on the economy, President Suleyman Demirel said that  the Turkish economy does not have a structural problem, that  there is investment, production, and exports. Turkey has  accumulated a certain amount of internal and external debt, he  said, and the interest on these debts is hurting Turkey's public  finance. This is not such a strange situation, he said, and the  state takes the necessary measures.    Demirel went on to say: I insist that the basis of the  monetary problem in Turkey today is the citizens' lack of trust  in their own money. I call on my people to trust the Turkish  lira. As long as you run away from your own currency by buying  U.S. dollars or other currencies, you will continue to  depreciate your own currency.</p>

			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Sun Alliance raises Pounds 125m via placing SUN ALLIANCE, the composite insurance group, yesterday raised Pounds 125m through a placement of cumulative irredeemable preference shares. The issue, which was foreshadowed when the company reported its results for the first half of 1993 in September, will strengthen the capital base at a time of rising insurance rates in the UK. Sun Alliance said the money would also allow the growth of its business overseas. It obtained shareholders' permission to raise up to Pounds 300m in preference shares at an extraordinary meeting last month. Cazenove and SG Warburg placed the issue. Sun Alliance reported a profit before tax of Pounds 61.7m in the first six months of 1993.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 11 (YONHAP) -- U.S. Undersecretary of  State Peter Tarnoff on Saturday denied former President Jimmy  Carter will carry any message from Washington to North Korea. He  also denied speculations that the United States shifted from its  earlier position and is now willing to engage in Moscow-proposed  multilateral conference to defuse the North Korean nuclear  crisis.    Tarnoff, heading home after his two-day visit to Seoul, said  at an airport news conference that the priority focus is to push  a sanction resolution at the United Nations.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, emerging from  talks with Russian Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, was quoted  as saying that Washington is willing to positively consider the  eight-way conference Russia suggested to discuss the North  Korean nuclear issue. For now, adopting a Security Council  resolution has to come foremost than any multilateral  conference, Tarnoff said, adding that the resolution will be  ready within days.    Tarnoff was optimistic about China's cooperation on U.N.  resolution, saying that Beijing fully understands the  seriousness of the current situation. Knowing that, China will  act in harmony as a member of the international community, he  said.    Asked whether Carter will carry any message from President  Bill Clinton when he visits North Korea next week, the  undersecretary emphasized that the ex-President goes to North  Korea as a private citizen. Washington, therefore, has no  intention to deliver a message through him, he said.</p>

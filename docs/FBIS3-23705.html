			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Svetlana Sukova: "Russian Delegation at Davos </F> Forum: Forum Calls for Easing of Reforms"]    [Text] After returning to Moscow late Tuesday evening,  Russian Minister of Foreign Economic Relations Oleg Davydov  commented on the results of the World Economic Forum held in  Davos (see KOMMERSANT-DAILY for February 2) for a  KOMMERSANT-DAILY correspondent. In Mr. Davydov's opinion, most  noteworthy was the attention that Western politicians and  businessmen devoted to the idea of adjustments in Russian  reforms: The need to "humanize" them was brought up in Davos  repeatedly. There were also promises to help Russia solve its  social problems, to grant its credits, and to establish socially  oriented funds for this purpose. The forum's participants  stressed the importance of continued reform, saying that the  pace of the process is not that important.    Mr. Davydov noted that the forum's participants basically  discussed issues of reform theory on the first day. After very  lengthy discussions and attempts to arrive at the best  definition for the concept of "reform," they arrived at a common  view: Economic reform has at least three essential components:  liberalization of prices and foreign trade, privatization, and  efforts to combat inflation.    But Mr. Davydov saw nothing fundamentally new in the Western  experts' discussion of economic reforms in Russia. Much more  interesting, in his opinion, was the attention devoted at the  forum to the social factor of reforms. Most of the speakers  called attention to the fact that the changes under way in  Russia are psychologically and physically difficult for the  majority of the population. The conclusion was that it is  essential to ease reform time tables and methods. There were  also proposals for earmarking several special Western funds and  credits for social programs. Mr. Davydov said that such Western  steps are attributable primarily to the West's fear of the  "Zhirinovskiy factor." It was said repeatedly at the forum that  this factor "will manifest itself increasingly distinctly as the  social situation of Russian citizens worsens" and that a return  "back onto the road of democracy will be far more costly."    And so the impatience and interest with which the  participants awaited the Russian prime minister's speech was not  surprising. In the minister's opinion, Viktor Chernomyrdin  succeeded in reassuring his audience. But particular attention  was paid not to his statements about continuing and deepening  reforms, but to the prime minister's support for the idea of a  tough state financial policy to control inflation.</p>

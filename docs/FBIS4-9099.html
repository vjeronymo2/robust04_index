			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Relayed by TV Polonia Network; passages within quotation </F> marks recorded]    [Text] [Announcer Grazyna Bukowska] Twenty percent of  establishment posts in the Polish Armed Forces remain vacant.  The posts of almost half of the NCO's [noncommissioned  officers] establishment and one in 10 officers are not filled.  The National Defense Ministry [MON] has, for the first time,  declassified the information on employment in the Armed Forces.    [Correspondent T. Bialoszewski] There are almost 90,000  professional servicemen in the Polish Army. Half of these are  officers. There are 26,000 warrant officers. The professional  NCO's are the fewest in number; there are only 19,000 of them.    [Major General Roman Harmoza, Defense Ministry head of  personnel, identified by caption] "The Army is short of 46  percent of its NCO's. It is they who form the backbone of the  Army because they work directly with the soldiers."    [Bialoszewski] Signals services, commonly described as the  neural network of the Army, are experiencing the worst personnel  problems. The MON staffing command states that the problem can  be resolved by contract service. Suitably qualified civilians  are taken on by these services.    [Harmoza] "We have 1,000 contract servicemen of different  ranks. This year we have taken 270 servicemen into the  services, and the limit has been exhausted."    [Bialoszewski] There are almost 10 times as many people  willing to do contract service as are taken on. The Army does  not have enough money to employ all of the necessary people.  The Army wants to rejuvenate itself. The principles of  retirement of officers will be rigorously observed. The  principles of promotion are also changing.    [Harmoza] "We will only be able to promote people if there  is  a vacancy for the promoted person. If we want to promote one  major, one major will have to go."    [Bialoszewski] Professional soldiers constitute only 30  percent of the Armed Forces; the ministry has plans for half of  the Armed Forces in the year 2000 to consist of professional  soldiers.</p>

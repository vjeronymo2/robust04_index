			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / Salvation Army 'knew of loss in August' THE Salvation Army learned that Dollars 8.8m of its funds had gone missing as long ago as last August, according to employees of the charity, although it did not issue a writ to recover them until last week. In spite of months of investigation by the accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand and the solicitors Slaughter and May on the charity's behalf, it has yet to trace the whereabouts of more than Dollars 6m of the missing funds. An investigation by the Financial Times shows that Salvation Army officers were naive in financial matters. The charity is reviewing its procedures to try to prevent any repetition of the alleged fraud. In early May Dollars 10m of charity funds were deposited in an account of ASLK-CGER Bank in Antwerp, Belgium. At the time the charity was feeling financially stretched, according to members. An officer in charge of fund-raising, Colonel Grenville Burn, had been persuaded by Mr Stuart Ford and Mr Gamil Naguib, two financiers, that the charity could make a substantial profit by investing the Dollars 10m in standby letters of credit. Other officers of the charity also approved the proposed investment. Col Burn has since been suspended from his duties. Approval for the opening of the Antwerp account was given by Commissioner Larsson, the senior UK officer. Whenever an account for the charity is opened, approval has to be given by Commissioner Larsson. However, Dollars 8.8m of the funds were transferred to Banque Continentale du Luxembourg over the summer, without the knowledge of most of the charity's senior officers. The Belgian bank account had four signatories: Col Burn; Colonel Ivor Rich, another officer; Mr Ford and Mr Naguib. The charity had been persuaded to allow Mr Ford and Mr Naguib to be signatories so that the bank would give them account information, but employees of the charity insist that they never expected Mr Ford or Mr Naguib to be involved in transferring the funds. Any transfers from the account required two signatures. Also during the summer, Mr John Renshaw, the chairman of the charity's London Advisory Board and a former deputy chairman of building group John Laing, warned the charity not to invest funds in standby letters of credit because he was concerned the funds would be lost. In August, Col Rich travelled to Antwerp and discovered that the Dollars 8.8m had been moved. He then travelled to the Luxembourg office of Banque Continentale, but only Dollars 520,000 was left in the Luxembourg account. Commissioner Larsson had not approved the opening of this account. The funds had been transferred to Panama and Leichtenstein. The charity says that some of the funds were eventually invested in a dogtrack in Ayr in Scotland, a Scottish public house and a project to build an airport next to a Scottish village. The charity has traced Dollars 1.825m of funds invested in such projects, but is uncertain about the whereabouts of the remaining funds. Police were only informed officially last week of the alleged fraud by the Salvation Army although it is understood that some police officers had earlier obtained information that linked involved individuals with a separate investigation. Fraud Squad detectives are working on the theory that officers of the Salvation Army were innocent victims in an alleged financial swindle orchestrated by international fraudsters.</p>

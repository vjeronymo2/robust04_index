			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Tokyo FNN Television in Japanese at  2318 GMT on 19 February in its "News 2001" program carries a  live 33- minute interview with Former Prime Minister Kiichi  Miyazawa by FNN announcers Yuji Kuroiwa and Kaori Matsuyama,  political commentator Kenichi Takemura, and Keio University  Professor Yoshiaki Kobayashi at the FNN studio in Tokyo, with  frequent and lengthy commercial messages.    Asked by Kuroiwa about the present state of Japan-U.S.  relations, Miyazawa says: "I am worried about the relations.  This is not the time for the prime minister to say that an  adult Japan-U.S. relationship has been built. It is important  to bring Japan-U.S. relations back to a normal state." Miyazawa  also says: "Japan-U.S. relations are important to the two  countries and the two countries should give consideration to  their importance."    Asked by Kuroiwa to comment on the breakdown of the  Japan-U.S. framework talks, Miyazawa says: "It is wrong for the  United States to stick to its demand for setting numerical  targets. I told President Clinton when we met last April that  numerical targets are no good. The President expressed an  understanding of my view. It is said that the President did not  ask for numerical targets at a meeting with Prime Minister  Hosokawa." Miyazawa also says although he does not know the  details, the President and Prime Minister Hosokawa had enough  time to bridge the differences between the bureaucrats of the  two countries. On the breakdown of the Japan- U.S. framework  talks, Miyazawa says, "Given the importance of Japan- U.S.  relations and the responsibility of the two countries to the  international community, the breakdown of the framework talks is  not a good thing."    After a brief interview via satellite with an unidentified  American researcher on future Japan-U.S. relations, the subject  returns to Japan-U.S. trade friction. Discussing the trade  friction, Miyazawa says, "Japan must keep in mind that relations  with the United States have reached the point where the United  States is now applying pressure on Japan to change its trade  stand."    Discussing Japan-U.S. trade friction, Miyazawa says: "I  believe that what is at issue is the relationship between the  leaders of the two countries. Since Japan and the United States  are contacting each other in a broad range of areas, some  problems are bound to arise in certain areas and I believe it is  normal that such problems are arising. It is important for the  two countries to restore a venue for dialogue."    Miyazawa also says: "I believe that Japan should expand its  domestic demand. Taken individually, Japan has no choice but to  deal positively with the issue of automobile, government  procurement, and insurance one by one. The figure of $50  billion or $60 billion in Japan's trade surplus with the United  States cannot be drastically reduced. Japan has no choice but  to take efforts to reduce the trade surplus and work to have the  United States understand its efforts."    Asked by Murayama to comment on Japan's moves to take its  case to GATT if the United States imposes sanctions on Japan,  Miyazawa says: "It is good for Japan to do so. What the latest  GATT multilateral negotiations concluded is that the 1988  Omnibus Trade Act's Super 301 provision runs counter to GATT  rules. The United States has been told by GATT not to restore  the provision. Nonetheless, the United States still intends to  restore the provision, and this is problematic. I believe that  it is good for Japan to take its case to GATT if the United  States slaps sanctions on Japan."    Discussing Japan-U.S. trade friction, Miyazawa says:  "European nations think that numerical targets are ridiculous.  If Japan takes its case to GATT and a GATT arbitration panel is  set up, Japan can win. European nations are saying that $60  billion in Japan's trade surplus with the United States is too  huge and the Japanese market should be opened wider."    After a brief interview via satellite with an unidentified  American researcher, the subject returns again to Japan-U.S.  trade friction. Asked by Takemura to comment on U.S. criticism  of the Japanese bureaucracy, Miyazawa says: "This time, the  President criticized the Japanese bureaucracy. It is reasonable  for the President to intend to accomplish a lot during his term  of office. The President criticized officials of the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry. I think his criticism was an  expression of his view that Japanese politics should exercise  leadership more aggressively."    Discussing future Japan-U.S. relations, Miyazawa says:  "Trade relations between the two countries are a part of  Japan-U.S. relations. What is most important for Japan's  diplomacy is to maintain friendly relations with the United  States. The United States places its relations with Japan at the  top of its foreign policy agenda. Since the two countries have  contacts in a broad range of areas, some problems are bound to  arise and the problems will not disappear. The two countries  are aware of this. Leaders of the two countries should work to  prevent the people of the two countries from feeling unfriendly  toward each other."    Commenting on Japanese bureaucracy, Miyazawa says: "The  Japanese bureaucracy is very good at doing what is precedented,  but it is not good at doing something new. I think that doing  something new should come from the political leadership."    Discussing a realignment of the political parties, Miyazawa  says, "There will be no realignment of the political parties  within this year." Miyazawa also adds: "Some have argued for  amending the Constitution to promote Japan's military buildup.  I think that the economically effective military buildup is the  development of nuclear weapons and this is what Japan can do.  If Japan posses the nuclear weapons, it should not use them.  If it does not use them, it would serve nothing. The  management of nuclear weapons is very difficult. If Japan was a  dictatorial nation, it could easily develop them. Japan should  not become such a nation. It is very difficult for any nation  to keep its deterrent without using the nuclear weapons. I  believe that Japan should not develop such nuclear weapons."    The interview ends at 2351 GMT.</p>

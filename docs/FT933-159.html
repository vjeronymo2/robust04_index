			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Fuel for a bumpy drive ahead: Fiat's financial package is designed to defend the group at a time of weak demand for cars The fanfare surrounding the launch earlier this month of Fiat's new model, the Punto, was unprecedented. Turin, the group's home town, was taken over by Fiat for lavish presentation parties stretching nearly two weeks. Italy's largest private company had less to trumpet when it unveiled this week how it intends to provide the financial muscle and management skill to survive as a significant player in the competitive automotive business. Fiat's strategy seems to be based on the principle that the best means of attacking the market is by defending itself; and the stock market's initial reaction has been cool. For the moment at least Fiat has shown that, unlike Renault and Volvo, it is not staking its fate on an international marriage. Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman and head of the family, has reversed his oft repeated decision to step aside in favour his brother, Umberto, next June. Instead, he will stay on with full executive power in the hands of his faithful lieutenant, Cesare Romiti. This ducks the succession question in the Agnelli family for the time being, though prepares the way for a further dilution of their control. At the same time Fiat has found a hard core of shareholders, along with the Agnelli family, to help raise cash to cover the likely substantial operating losses at the year-end. Fiat has not raised capital since 1984 and the planned rights issue will be the country's largest. With the sale of its Rinascente retailing arm and a complex set of other transactions, Fiat will raise an estimated L6,250bn (Pounds 2.6bn). Fiat is in the middle of an investment programme to revitalise its car and truck ranges, and other non-auto activities - L40,000bn is going to its car operations. Its ambitions are, however, devouring funds almost as quickly as its robots can churn out new models, and come at a time of unprecedented difficulties because of the steep fall in demand for new cars and trucks in most leading markets. The climate is harsh for carmakers throughout Europe: total car sales fell by 16 per cent in the first eight months of this year. Fiat's turnover on the cars side fell by almost 12 per cent in the first six months of this year while truck sales dropped by nearly 16 per cent. The falls were the main reasons behind this week's L966bn pre-tax loss for the first half of 1993. The losses were much higher than most observers expected. Short of extraordinary profits from the disposal of assets such as Rinascente, they suggest 1993 will be by far the worst year in the company's history. As the group's cash flow is no longer sufficient to generate enough money for investment, Fiat has been obliged to turn to shareholders for help. This week's package contained four main elements: The group will raise about L3,300bn via a series of financial measures. Shareholders will be offered new shares at L2,000 each, raising about L2,234bn. A further L194bn will come from the sale of non-voting shares to employees at the same price. Also, shareholders will be offered warrants, exchangeable for new ordinary shares, to produce a further L857bn. Separately, two big institutional investors will buy shares as well as subscribing to the rights issue. Alcatel Alsthom, the French industrial company which in 1991 purchased Fiat's Telettra telecommunications subsidiary, will invest about L615bn. That will repay a convertible bond linked to the Telettra sale and raise Alcatel's stake in Fiat to about 2.2 per cent from 1 per cent. Meanwhile, Generali, Italy's biggest insurance company, will acquire 35m shares which, together with its subscription to the rights issue, will give it a 2.4 per cent holding in the Fiat group. In return, Fiat is to spend about L160bn on a 40 per cent holding in Generali's Paris-based Europ Assistance insurance and travel services operation. Fiat will sell control of Rinascente, Italy's biggest retailer, in which it owns 58 per cent of the ordinary shares. No price has been announced and Rinascente shares were suspended on Tuesday pending further information. Assuming Fiat receives a reasonable premium in return for ceding its majority stake, market analysts estimate the holding is worth about L1,250bn. Rinascente is an attractive asset. The group made net profits of L102bn on sales of L5,040bn last year. Heavy investments in new stores and the modernisation of existing outlets helped lift this year's first-half profits by 31 per cent to L25.3bn, in spite of the recession, which has bitten hard into Italian retail sales. While the rights issue and the sale of Rinascente were broadly expected and generally welcomed by the stock market, the two other aspects of this week's package were viewed much more cautiously. Fiat failed to produce the long-awaited top management changes which many shareholders consider crucial to its future. Instead, Mr Giovanni Agnelli and Mr Romiti are to stay on for another two years. Neither is young. Mr Agnelli is 72, and was to have been succeeded by his brother, Umberto, almost 14 years younger, after next year's annual shareholders' meeting. Mr Romiti, managing director since 1976, is 70. Fiat justified the decision to waive the company's compulsory retirement age in terms of providing 'continuity' in a tough period. But the announcement has been seen as demonstrating the unwillingness of the Agnelli family, which owns a controlling stake in the Fiat group, to accept controversial decisions about the group's strategy. 'These are the very people who have got Fiat into its present mess,' says the Italian specialist at one leading UK stockbroker. 'The company urgently needs new blood to push through drastic cost-cutting measures, similar to those taking place at Volkswagen.' Continuity could also prove risky on the legal front. A number of Fiat's senior managers have been implicated in Italy's 18-month political corruption scandal. Observers fear Mr Romiti, who has appeared before Milan magistrates investigating alleged kickbacks to politicians but has not been charged and has denied any involvement, could again face questioning, embarrassing the company. Fiat's decision to form a 'hard core' of big shareholders, controlling 30 per cent of its equity, could be against the interests of smaller investors. The hard core - which includes newcomers Alcatel Alsthom and Generali as well as established shareholders such as Deutsche Bank and Mediobanca, the Milan merchant bank - has agreed to act in unison on important decisions. It also comprises Ifi and Ifil, two quoted investment companies dominated by the Agnellis. The pact erects a cordon of institutional investors around Fiat, offering protection against the risk of a hostile takeover bid. It may also be a way of enshrining Agnelli family control of the company at a time when the group's cash needs could exhaust even the family's substantial personal resources. Concern about Fiat's attitude towards minority shareholders has been accentuated by the structure of the Rinascente sale. Rather than selling the company to a third party, Fiat is ceding control to Ifil, which is one of its main shareholders. The transaction is attractive for the Fiat group, in that it provides a quick and essential cash boost. Whether it is as appealing to the minority shareholders in Fiat, Rinascente or Ifil is less clear. The fact that all three companies have cross-shareholding links and are directly or indirectly controlled by the Agnellis has raised fears among critics of conflicts of interest. Only when trading resumes in the shares of Rinascente and Ifil - which were suspended pending the announcement of details of the deal - will it be possible to gauge investors' reaction. Early indications suggested some hesitancy. Fiat's ordinary shares fell by almost 8 per cent yesterday, closing at L5,595. Soundings among analysts suggest that there is sympathy for Fiat's commitment to the core cars business. Investors have been impressed by the group's determination to renew its ageing range of cars, starting with the new Punto small car. There is an acceptance that such modernisation requires a considerable cash injection. Attractive new models and hopes for a recovery in the demand for cars in the second half of next year mean the group may be able to look back on 1993 as a nightmare. But Fiat's failure to give a decisive signal on management changes and to provide more transparent terms for the sale of Rinascente have left a sour taste. The structure of this week's financial package suggests that transparency and the need to avoid the impression of conflicts of interest remain fairly low on Mr Agnelli's list of priorities.</p>

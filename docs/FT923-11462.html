			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Mass action will test fragile social fabric THE failure of South African business and labour to avert a general strike next month has set the stage for a period of civil and labour conflict which could not have come at a worse time. The strike, on August 3 and 4, and the following days of rallies, marches and local demonstrations, take place against a background of an economy in deep recession and a volatile political environment where incidents of politically related violence continue unabated. The efforts of business and labour in recent weeks to negotiate a charter for peace, democracy and economic reconstruction had contributed to a palpable sense that the political clouds were lifting. The announcement by President F W de Klerk that the controversial Koevoet and 32 Battalion military units were being disbanded, and the sending of United Nations special envoy, Mr Cyrus Vance, to the country contributed further to this more optimistic mood. Now the country faces a week of mass action, unprecedented in its scope in recent years, which will severely test the fragile social fabric. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, secretary general of the African National Congress (ANC), said yesterday that in failing to reach agreement with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), business had missed an 'historic opportunity'. He accused them of a 'lack of commitment and resolve to solve the current crisis'. This view was disputed by the South African Employers' Consultative Committee on Labour Affairs (Saccola), the umbrella employer body, which said that 'the breakdown is rooted in our inability to reach agreement on a total shutdown of all sectors of the economy' - a compromise discussed for August 3 instead of a week-long strike. Although the strike will take place, the efforts of business and labour were not in vain. Agreement failed to materialise when the perception took hold among the business community that it was giving a lot more than it was getting. Both parties agree the draft charter represents considerable progress which can be built upon in future. The four sections of the charter - curbing violence, combating poverty, conflict intervention and political transition - would commit business, in particular, to an unprecedented involvement in addressing the main constitutional and socio-political challenges facing the country. Just how successful the mass action campaign will be in putting large numbers of people onto the streets is a moot point. There is a growing feeling in the business community that mass action is something of a paper tiger. Where mass action does become threatening is in the possibility that it will fuel further violence. The main concern lies in the potential for clashes between ANC/Cosatu members, supporting the stayaway, and members of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) who are determined to go to work. Cosatu's mobilisation efforts will not have been assisted by the weakness of the economy and a 45 per cent unemployment rate. Its policies have also caused a significant hardening of attitudes among businessmen who feel that they and the economy have taken about as much as they can.</p>

The all-share composite stock price index was nearing 900  points on a three-day rebound when the announcement that the  government wanted prices to drop sent it nosediving 15.85 points  to 882.81 as of 2:15 p.m.    It had diagnosed signs of overheating in the market, the  government said, and so decided to cool things off by letting  securities companies lend shares, making institutional investors  put down deposits on stock like small investors, and encouraging  banks and other financial institutions not to buy shares. This  is to take effect on Monday.    There was little change on the surface at first as the flood  of sell offers generated by the rebirth of share loans and  selling by the stock stabilization fund was absorbed, but the  selling got the upper hand toward the end of the morning session.    Just a few high PER (price/earnings ratio) shares such as  Taekwang Industrial Co. and large manufacturing issues such as  Pohang Iron and Steel Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. rose by  the daily ceiling.</p>
